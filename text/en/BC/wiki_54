<text>Frankfurt Airport ( ) , is Germany&#x27;s main international airport by passenger numbers, located in Frankfurt, Germany&#x27;s fifth-largest city. Its official name according to the German Aeronautical Information Publication is Frankfurt Main Airport. The airport is operated by Fraport and serves as the main hub for Lufthansa, including Lufthansa City Airlines, Lufthansa CityLine and Lufthansa Cargo as well as Condor and AeroLogic. It covers an area of of land and features two passenger terminals with capacity for approximately 65 million passengers per year; four runways; and extensive logistics and maintenance facilities.

Frankfurt Airport is the busiest airport by passenger traffic in Germany as well as the 6th busiest in Europe after Istanbul Airport, London–Heathrow, Paris–Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport. The airport is also the 13th busiest worldwide by total number of passengers in 2016, with 60.786 million passengers using the airport in 2016. In 2017, Frankfurt Airport handled 64.5 million passengers and nearly 70 million in 2018. It also had a freight throughput of 2.076 million metric tonnes in 2015 and is the busiest airport in Europe by cargo traffic. As of 2022, Frankfurt Airport serves 330 destinations in 5 continents, making it the airport with the most direct routes in the world.

The southern side of the airport ground was home to the Rhein-Main Air Base, which served as a major air base for the United States from 1947 until 2005, when the air base was closed and the property was acquired by Fraport (now occupied by Terminal 3). The airport celebrated its 80th anniversary in July 2016.

==Location==
Frankfurt Airport lies southwest of central Frankfurt, near the Autobahn interchange Frankfurter Kreuz, where two of the most heavily used motorways in Europe (A3 and A5) meet. The airport grounds, which form a city district of Frankfurt named Frankfurt-Flughafen, are surrounded by the Frankfurt City Forest. The southern portion of the airport grounds extend partially into the towns of Rüsselsheim am Main and Mörfelden-Walldorf, and a western portion of the grounds lie within the town of Kelsterbach.

The airport is centrally located in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region, Germany&#x27;s third-largest metropolitan region, which itself has a central location in the densely populated region of the west-central European megalopolis. Thereby, along with a strong rail and motorway connection, the airport serves as a major transport node for the greater region, less than two hours by ground to Cologne, the Ruhr Area, and Stuttgart.

==History==
===First airport===

On 16 November 1909, the world&#x27;s first airline was founded in Frankfurt am Main: The &quot;Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (DELAG). DELAG then built the first airport in Frankfurt, called &quot;Airship Base at Rebstock&quot;, which was located in Bockenheim in the western part of the city and was primarily used for airships in the beginning. It opened in 1912 and was extended after World War I, but in 1924, an expert&#x27;s report already questioned the possibility of further expansions at this location.

With the foundation of Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1926, a rapid boom in civilian air travel started, and soon the airship base became too small to handle the demand. Plans for a new and larger airport located in the Frankfurt City Forest southwest of Schwanheim were approved in 1930 but were not realized due to the Great Depression. After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; in 1933, the government revived the plans and started the construction of the new airport.

===Current airport===
A two-storey station building with a six-storey tower originated in 1935 on the northern part of the airport, as well as other operating and outbuildings for maintenance and storage of aircraft. The approximately 100 hectares runway received a grass cover.

The official opening of the new &quot; Flug- und Luftschiffhafen Rhein-Main&quot; took place on 8 July 1936. The first plane that landed was a Ju 52/3m. Six days later, on 14 July 1936, LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin &quot;landed at the airport. In 1936, 800 tons of cargo and 58,000 passengers were transported, and in 1937 these figures increased to 70,000 passengers and 966 tons of cargo. In the coming years, the new airport was the home base for the two largest German airships, LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin &quot;and LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. In 1938, Frankfurt was a central distribution point for the transport of airmail to North America.

On 6 May 1937, the &quot;Hindenburg, &quot;flying from Frankfurt to New York City, exploded shortly before it was scheduled to dock at Lakehurst. 36 people died. The accident marked the end of scheduled airship traffic and the end of the airship era.

====World War II====
After the beginning of World War II in 1939, all foreign airlines left the airport, and control of air traffic was transferred to the Luftwaffe.

The airships were dismantled and their huge hangars demolished on 6 May 1940 during the conversion of the base to military use. Luftwaffe engineers subsequently extended the single runway and erected hangars and other facilities for German military aircraft.

On 9 May 1940, the first bombers took off to attack France. From August to November 1944, a concentration camp was established in Walldorf, close to the airport site, where Jewish female prisoners were forced to work for the airport. The Allies of World War II destroyed the runway system with airstrikes in 1944, and the Wehrmacht blew up buildings and fuel depots in 1945, shortly before the US Army took control of the airport on 25 March 1945. After the German Instrument of Surrender, the war in Europe ended and the US Army started to build a new temporary runway at Frankfurt Airport. The southern part of the airport ground was occupied to build the Rhein-Main Air Base as an Air Force Base for the United States Air Forces in Europe.

====Berlin Airlift====
In 1948, the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies&#x27; rail and road access to the sectors of West Berlin under Allied control. Their aim was to force the Western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel, thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city. In response, the Western Allies organised the Berlin Airlift to carry supplies via air to the people in West Berlin. The airports in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Hannover were the primary bases for Allied aircraft. The heavy use of these so-called &quot;Raisin Bombers&quot; caused damage to the runway in Frankfurt and forced the US Army to build a second parallel runway. The airlift ended in September 1949 after the Soviet Union ended their blockade.

====Growth of the airport====

In 1951, restrictions for German air travellers were lifted and civil air traffic started to grow again. In 1952, Frankfurt Airport handled more than 400,000 passengers; a year later it was more than half a million. About 100 to 120 aeroplanes took off from and landed in Frankfurt daily. In 1955, Lufthansa resumed flights to and from Frankfurt and in the same year the Federal Republic of Germany gained its air sovereignty back from the Allies. In 1957, the northern runway was extended, first to and then to , to make it compatible with jet aircraft.

The airport did not emerge as a major international airline hub until 1958 when a new passenger terminal called &quot;Empfangsanlage Ost&quot; (Terminal East, literally &quot;Arrival Facility East&quot;) opened in the north-east corner of the airport site. Only four years later it was clear that the terminal was already too small for the demand. In 1961, Frankfurt already had 2.2 million passengers and 81,000 take-offs and landings, making it the second busiest airport in Europe behind Heathrow Airport, London.

In 1962, it was decided to build an even larger terminal with a capacity of 30 million passengers per year. Work on this terminal began in 1965. The southern runway was extended to in 1964. In 1970, a new hangar was inaugurated; this accommodated six jet aircraft and was the world&#x27;s largest hangar at the time.

====The new main terminal====
The new terminal, called &quot;Terminal Mitte&quot; (Central Terminal, today known as Terminal 1) is divided into three concourses (A, B and C) with 56 gates and an electric baggage handling system. Everything opened to the public on 14 March 1972. It was assumed that the terminal capacity would be sufficient for the next 30 years. Along with the new terminal, a railway station (Frankfurt Airport station) was opened, the first airport railway station in the Federal Republic of Germany. A few days later the old &quot;Empfangsanlage Ost&quot; was closed.

====The third runway====
Planning for a third runway (called &quot;Startbahn 18 West&quot;) began in 1973. This project spawned massive protests by residents and environmentalists. The main points of conflict were increasing noise and pollution and the cutting down of protected trees in the Frankfurt City Forest. While the protests and related lawsuits were unsuccessful in preventing construction, the &quot;Startbahn West&quot; protests were one of the major crystallisation points for the German environmental movement of the 1980s. The protests even continued after the runway had been opened in 1984 and in 1987 two police officers were killed by a gunman. This incident ended the &quot;Startbahn West&quot; protests for good. Because of its orientation in the north–south direction, in contrast to the other east–west runways, the use of the third runway is limited. The Startbahn West can only be used for takeoffs to the south to avoid interference with air traffic on the other runways. Owing to this restriction the runway must be partially or fully closed when northward winds are too strong.

====Terminal 2 and the second railway station====

In 1990, work on a new terminal (&quot;Terminal 2&quot;) began because it was anticipated that &quot;Terminal Mitte&quot; would reach its capacity limit sooner than expected. The new terminal, divided into concourses D and E, was built to the east of the existing terminal where once the &quot;Empfangsanlage Ost&quot; had been. With its opening in 1994, Frankfurt Airport increased its terminal capacity to 54 million passengers per year. Along with the terminal opening, a people mover system called &quot;Sky Line&quot; was established to provide a fast connection between &quot;Terminal 2&quot; and &quot;Terminal Mitte&quot; (now renamed &quot;Terminal 1&quot;).

In 1999 a second railway station, primarily for InterCityExpress long-distance trains (called Frankfurt Airport long-distance station), opened near Terminal 1 as part of the new Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line. At the same time local and regional rail services were based at the existing underground station, now renamed Frankfurt Airport regional station.

====Closure of the Rhein-Main Air Base====
On 30 December 2005, the Rhein-Main Air Base in the southern part of the airport ground was closed and the US Air Force moved to Ramstein Air Base. The property was handed back to Fraport which allows the airport to use it to build a new passenger terminal. The property of the housing area for the soldiers, called &quot;Gateway Gardens&quot;, which was located northeast of the airport site, was given back to the city of Frankfurt in the same year and will be developed as a business district in the following years.

====The Airbus A380 and &quot;The Squaire&quot;====

From 2005 to 2007, a large Airbus A380 maintenance facility was built at Frankfurt Airport because Lufthansa wanted to station their future A380 aircraft fleet there. Both terminals also underwent major renovations in order to handle the A380, including the installation of a third boarding bridge at several gates. Lufthansa&#x27;s first Airbus A380 went into operation in June 2010 and was named &quot;Frankfurt am Main&quot;.

In 2011, a large office building called &quot;The Squaire&quot; (a blend of &quot;square&quot; and &quot;air&quot;) opened at Frankfurt Airport. It was built on top of the Airport long-distance station and is considered the largest office building in Germany with floor area. The main tenants are KPMG and two Hilton Hotels.

Since 2012, the people mover &quot;The Squaire Metro&quot; connects the Squaire with the nine-storey parking structure. On a length of about 300 metres the so-called MiniMetro system with its two cabins can carry up to 1,300 passengers per hour. The constructor of the system was the Italian manufacturer Leitner.

====The fourth runway====
Plans to build a fourth runway at Frankfurt Airport were underway in 1997, but owing to violent conflicts with the concept Fraport let residents&#x27; groups and environmentalists participate in the process to find a mutually acceptable solution. In 2000, a task force presented their conclusion which generally approved a new runway, but of shorter length (only 2.8 kilometres compared to the other three 4-kilometre-long runways), which would serve as a landing-only runway for smaller aircraft. Additional requirements included improved noise protection arrangements and a strict ban on night flights between 11 pm and 5 am across the whole airport. In 2001, Fraport applied for approval to build the new runway, with three possible options. The conclusion was that a runway northwest of the airport site would have the least impact on local residents and the surrounding environment. The plans were approved by the Hessian government in December 2007, but the requested ban on night flights was lifted because it was argued that an international airport like Frankfurt would need night flights, especially for worldwide freight transport. Construction of the new long &quot;Runway Northwest&quot; in the Kelsterbach Forest began in early 2009.

In 2012, the website &quot;Airport Watch&quot; reported weekly protests had been occurring at the airport since the opening of a fourth runway a year previously.

====Developments since 2011====
The new runway officially went into operation on 20 October 2011, with an aircraft carrying Chancellor Angela Merkel, performing the first landing on 21 October. The centre line separation from the existing north runway is about . This allows simultaneous instrument landing system (ILS) operations on these two runways, which has not been possible on the other parallel runways, which do not meet the minimum separation for ILS operations. This allowed the airport to increase its capacity from 83 to 126 aircraft movements per hour.

On 11 October 2011, the Hessian Administration Court ruled that night flights between 11pm and 5am (the so-called &quot;Mediationsnacht&quot;) are no longer allowed at Frankfurt Airport after the inauguration of the new runway, and therefore overrode the approval from the Hessian government from 2007 which allowed 17 scheduled flights per night. On 4 April 2012, the German Administrative Court confirmed the decision of the Hessian Administration Court, banning night flights between 11pm and 5am.

To handle the predicted passenger amount of about 90 million in 2020, a new terminal section adjacent to Terminal 1 for an additional six million passengers opened on 10 October 2012. It is called &quot;Flugsteig A-Plus&quot; and is exclusively used by Lufthansa mainly for their long-haul flights. Flugsteig A-Plus features eight parking positions that are able to handle four Airbus A380s or seven Boeing 747-8/747–400 at once.

In November 2016, Ryanair announced the opening of a new base at Frankfurt Airport with four routes to Spain and Portugal. This move by Ryanair was heavily blasted, especially by Lufthansa, as Ryanair was granted high discounts and incentives regarding the airport&#x27;s fees. On 28 February 2017, Ryanair announced its winter programme for Frankfurt which will see a further 20 new routes being added.

====2011 shooting====

Albanian citizen, Arid Uka, a 21 year old at the time, targeted a United States Air Force bus parked outside the terminal building that was supposed to transport fifteen U.S. airmen to Ramstein Air Base. He reportedly walked up to a waiting airman, asked him for a cigarette, and wanted to know whether the airmen were bound for Afghanistan. When the airman said yes, according to German prosecutor Rainer Griesbaum, Uka waited for the airman to turn away and then shot him in the back of the head, killing him. Shouting &quot;Allahu Akbar!&quot; the attacker then entered the bus, shooting and killing the driver, and continued to fire three shots at two other airmen, wounding them. When he pointed his pistol at the head of another airman and pulled the trigger, the weapon jammed. Uka fled, but was pursued by the civilian airport employee Lamar Joseph Conner and Staff Sergeant Trevor Donald Brewer and shortly afterwards overpowered by two German police officers. He was subsequently arrested. Conner and Brewer later received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in a ceremony on 16 January 2012. Federal Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich presented the decoration, citing their &quot;exemplary courage and action which helped the Federal Police arrest the suspect&quot;. Uka was sentenced to Life and will be deported.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
Portions of the airport were closed in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Northwest Runway and Runway 18 West were closed on 23 March and re-purposed for parking unused aircraft. Terminal 2 was also closed, and all passenger operations were concentrated in Terminal 1. The Northwest Runway re-opened in July to handle summer tourist demand, while Runway 18 West remained closed. With almost no passenger traffic in the spring months, Frankfurt&#x27;s total passenger volume in 2020 fell to 18.8 million, the lowest figure recorded since 1984.

==Terminals==
===Overview===
Frankfurt Airport features two large main passenger terminals (Terminals 1 and 2), with Terminal 3 under construction, as well as a much smaller dedicated &quot;First Class Terminal&quot; which is operated and exclusively used by Lufthansa. As is the case at London–Heathrow, Tokyo–Narita and other major airports, terminal operations are grouped for airlines and airline alliances rather than into domestic and international routes. However, there are dedicated sections for Schengen and non-Schengen routes.

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 is the older and larger one of the two passenger terminals. The landside is 420 metres long. It has been enlarged several times and is divided into concourses &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; and has a capacity of approximately 50 million passengers per year. Terminal 1 is functionally divided into three levels, the departures level on the upper floor with check-in counters, the arrivals level with baggage claim areas on the ground floor and, underneath, a distribution floor with access to the regional station and underground and multilevel parking. Departures and arrivals levels each have separate street approaches. A bus station is located at the arrivals level. Terminal 1 has a total of 103 gates, which include 54 gates equipped with jetways (25 in Concourse A, 18 in Concourse B, 11 in Concourse C). Concourse &quot;Z&quot; sits on top of Concourse &quot;A&quot; sharing the same jet bridges between both concourses. Flights to non-Schengen destinations depart from the &quot;Z&quot; gates and Schengen flights depart from the &quot;A&quot; gates.

Pier A was extended by 500 metres in 2000, and a link between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, as well as the Hall C extension opened in 2008.

On 10 October 2012, an 800-metre-long westward expansion of Terminal 1 called &quot;Pier A-Plus&quot; went into operation. It provides more stands for wide-body aircraft like the Airbus A380.

Terminal 1 is primarily used by the Lufthansa Group and its Star Alliance partners, amongst them Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and United Airlines. Some airlines that are not part of the Lufthansa Group or Star Alliance however also use Terminal 1 with Condor being the largest tenant among others.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2, which has a capacity of 15 million passengers a year, was opened in 1994 and is divided into concourses &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;. A continuous concourse between Terminal 1C and 2D provides direct but non-public access between the two terminals. It has eight gates with jetways and 34 apron stands, a total of 42 gates and is able to handle wide-body aircraft such as the Airbus A380.

Terminal 2 is primarily used by airlines of the oneworld (e.g. American Airlines and Cathay Pacific) and SkyTeam alliances (e.g. Delta Air Lines and Vietnam Airlines amongst others). It also used by several further airlines that do not belong to any of the three major airline alliances, including airBaltic, Emirates, Etihad Airways and Icelandair among others.

Fraport announced in late 2022 that Terminal 2 will be temporarily closed for refurbishment starting in 2026. All tenants are to be relocated into the then fully completed Terminal 3.

===Terminal 3 (under construction)===

In 2009, the German government decided to create third terminals for both Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport in order to handle expected passenger flows of 90 million in Frankfurt by 2020 and 50 million in Munich by 2017. The new terminal is scheduled to be built by Fraport, south of the existing terminals on the grounds of the former Rhein-Main Air Base. The new &quot;Terminal 3&quot; is to accommodate up to 25 million passengers and will feature 75 new aircraft positions when completely constructed. An extension of the &quot;SkyLine&quot; people mover system is planned to connect the new terminal to Terminals 1 and 2 and the airport train stations.

In August 2014, the city of Frankfurt granted building permission for the first phase of Terminal 3. The groundbreaking for the new terminal took place on 5 October 2015. Its first phase, consisting of the main building and two of the planned four piers (concourses 3H and 3J), is planned to open by 2026 and will be able to handle 15 million additional passengers per year. Total costs are estimated at 3 billion euros.

In 2017, Frankfurt Airport first indicated that the second-phase construction of the easternmost pier (concourse 3G) could be moved forward so that low-cost carriers can use this pier from 2021. After approval by municipal authorities in 2018, the piers will be constructed and used according to the following timetable:

In March 2021, Fraport announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening of the new terminal had been postponed to 2026.

Concourse 3G (easternmost pier for low-cost carriers) 
* Phase 1 Construction of first twelve bus gates, reachable via shuttle buses from terminals 1/2, Completed 2022 but not yet operational
* Phase 2 Construction of additional twelve bus gates by 2024
* Phase 3 Construction of passenger jet bridges by 2025/2026

Check-in area, concourses 3H and 3J (central piers): Construction well underway for opening with 3G in 2026 including transport systems for visitors, passengers and luggage to the other terminals
* Concourse 3H is planned for Schengen flights
* Concourse 3J is planned for non-Schengen flights

Concourse 3K (westernmost pier): Possible third-phase expansion depending on the development of passenger numbers

==Runways==
Frankfurt Airport has four runways of which three are arranged parallel in an east–west direction and one in a north–south direction. In 2010 three runways (Runways North, South and West) handled 464,432 aircraft movements, which equated to 83 movements per hour. With the start of operation of the Northwest Runway in October 2011 the airport was predicted to be able to handle 126 movements per hour. It is predicted that aircraft movements will increase up to 700,000 in the year 2020. By using the fourth runway, Frankfurt Airport is able for the first time to handle simultaneous parallel landings, because the distance between the north and the north-west runways is . Simultaneous parallel landings were not possible with the north and south runway pairing, because the separation distance did not meet the safety standards.

During normal operation, the two outer parallel runways (07L/25R and 07R/25L) are used for landings and the central parallel runway (07C/25C) and the Runway West (18) for take-offs. The three parallel runways have two markings because they can be operated in two directions while the Runway West can only be used in one direction.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
Lufthansa and their Star Alliance partners account for the majority of all traffic at Frankfurt Airport. The following airlines offer year-round and seasonal scheduled and charter flights at Frankfurt Airport:


===Cargo===

==Other facilities==
===CargoCity===
Frankfurt Airport is the second-largest multimodal transport airport in Europe and has several logistics facilities. These facilities are grouped at two areas at the airport ground: In the north (CargoCity Nord) and in the south (CargoCity Süd). In 2010 it was the second-busiest airport by cargo traffic in Europe after Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport, handling 2,231,348 metric tonnes of loaded and unloaded freight. CargoCity is the name of the two large main areas featuring most of the airport&#x27;s freight handling facilities:

* The 98 hectare large CargoCity Süd (&quot;South&quot;) is home to a cargo centre for dispatch service providers and freight forwarding businesses. Several transport companies like DHL Global Forwarding, Air China, LUG Aircargo Handling (Emirates, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Cargolux Airlines, Aegean Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Siberian Airlines, South African Airways, Uzbekistan Airways) and Fraport Cargo Services are based here.
* CargoCity Nord (&quot;North&quot;) is the headquarters of Lufthansa Cargo. Additional facilities here are a Perishables Centre for fresh produced goods and the Frankfurt Animal Lounge for the transport of living animals.

===Airport City===
The airport ground and the surrounding area of Frankfurt Airport offer a large variety of on-airport businesses as well as airport-related businesses, including office space, hotels, shopping areas, conference rooms and car parks. The development of an airport city has significantly accelerated in recent years.

====Frankfurt Airport Centres====

The Frankfurt Airport Centre 1 (FAC 1) near Terminal 1 offers office and conference facilities, the newer FAC 2 is located within Terminal 2 and offers office space for airlines. FAC Building 234 accommodates the head office of Discover Airlines, previously named Eurowings Discover.

====Airport City Mall====
The Airport City Mall is located on the landside of Terminal 1, departure hall B. It offers national and international retailers and label stores, a supermarket and several restaurants.

====The Squaire====

The Squaire is an office and retail building with a total floor area of . It is directly connected to Terminal 1 through a connecting corridor for pedestrians. The accounting firm KPMG, Lufthansa and two Hilton Hotels (&quot;Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport&quot; with 334 rooms and Hilton Frankfurt Airport with 249 rooms) occupy space in The Squaire.

====Main Airport Centre====
The Main Airport Centre, named after the Main river, is an office building with ten floors and about of office space. It is located at the edge of the Frankfurt City Forest near Terminal 2.

====Sheraton Hotel &amp; Conference Centre====
Sheraton Hotels and Resorts offers 1,008 guest rooms adjacent to Terminal 1 and a conference centre for up to 200 delegates.

====Gateway Gardens====
Gateway Gardens is a former housing area for the US Air Force personnel based at the Rhein-Main Air Base, close to Terminal 2. Like the air base, the housing area was closed in 2005. Since then the area is being developed into a business location for airport-related companies. Lufthansa moved its airline catering subsidiary LSG Sky Chefs to Gateway Gardens, Condor and SunExpress are headquartered here. DB Schenker, the logistics company of Deutsche Bahn, have built a high-rise building.

In December 2019, local trains were re-routed to run via Gateway Gardens station. The new stop for S-Bahn trains is located between Frankfurt Airport Regional Station and Frankfurt-Stadion station. The journey time will increase by 4 minutes but Deutsche Bahn have stated that they will use new trains (ET423) which will be faster and have more capacity.

===Further users===
* Fraport&#x27;s facilities are on the property of Frankfurt Airport. Its head office building is by Gate 3. The newly constructed headquarters were inaugurated there in 2012. The Fraport Driving School (Fraport Fahrschule) is in Building 501 of CargoCity South (CargoCity Süd).
* Lufthansa&#x27;s corporate headquarters, where the board of directors is seated, is the &quot;Lufthansa Aviation Centre&quot; (LAC), Building 366 at Frankfurt Airport. Several company departments, including Corporate Communications, Investor Relations, and Media Relations, are based at the LAC. Lufthansa also uses several other buildings in the area, including the Lufthansa Flight Training Center for flight training operations and the &quot;Lufthansa Basis BG2&quot; as a central base and for crew briefing. As of 2011 Lufthansa Cargo has been headquartered in Building 451 of the Frankfurt Airport area. As of 2012 Lufthansa Cargo is located at Gate 25 in the CargoCity Nord area, Lufthansa Technik is located at Gate 23 and in the CargoCity Süd area.

==Statistics==
===Annual traffic===

===Route statistics===



==Ground transport==
Frankfurt Airport can be accessed by car, taxi, train or bus as it features an extensive transport network. There are two railway stations at the airport: one for suburban/regional trains and one for long-distance trains.

===Inter-Terminal transit===
Passengers and visitors can change terminals with the people mover system SkyLine which has three stops in Terminal 1 (at gates A/Z, B and C) as well as one in Terminal 2 for all gates. Some stops can only be used by passengers in or outside the Schengen zone which is achieved by separated cars and station entrances. The travel time between the terminals is 2 minutes with trains arriving every 2–3 minutes during the day. Each train has two cars, one airside (outside the Schengen area) and one landside (within the Schengen area). Most stations have a platform on each side of the train, so landside passengers can only step out onto the landside platform, and airside passengers can only step out onto the airside platform. Additionally, there is a regular bus service between the terminals.

A new passenger transport system is also under construction for the connection of the new terminal 3 and the existing terminals 1 and 2. It will use a track which is separate from the existing SkyLine people mover but will allow for interchanges between them. It is scheduled to have four stops in the final stage near the airport&#x27;s two railway stations, at Terminals 1C and 2DE as well as the new Terminal 3.

===Rail===
====Regional station====

Frankfurt Airport regional station (&quot;Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof&quot;) at Terminal 1, concourse B, provides access to the S-Bahn commuter rail lines &quot;S8&quot; and &quot;S9&quot;. Each of these lines have trains departing every 15 minutes during daytime to Hanau Central Station eastwards via Frankfurt Central Station and Offenbach East Station or Wiesbaden Central Station westwards via Rüsselsheim or Mainz Central Station (line S8) or Mainz-Kastel Station (line S9).

The journey time to Frankfurt Central Station is 10–12 minutes.

Regional Express (RE) trains to Saarbrücken, Koblenz or Würzburg call at this station. These trains provide less frequent but additional connections between Frankfurt Airport and the Central Station.

====Long-distance station====


Frankfurt Airport long-distance station (&quot;Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof&quot;) was opened in 1999. The station is squeezed in between the motorway A 3 and the four-lane &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; B43, linked to Terminal 1 by a connecting corridor for pedestrians that bridges the Autobahn. It is the end point of the newly built Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line, which links southern Germany to the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, the Netherlands and Belgium via Cologne at speeds up to . About 10 trains per hour depart in all directions.

Deutsche Bahn operates the AIRail Service in conjunction with Lufthansa, American Airlines and Emirates. The service operates to the central stations of Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Leipzig, Hamburg, Hannover, Mannheim, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and to Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe.

Frankfurt Airport is located in the Frankfurt City Forest and directly connected to an Autobahn intersection called Frankfurter Kreuz where the A3 and A5 meet. It takes a 10–15 minutes by car or taxi to get to Frankfurt Central Station or the centre of the city.

Ghotra Ride is a popular taxi service at Frankfurt Airport.

Passengers driving their own cars can park in multilevel parking garages (mostly underground) along the terminals. A long term holiday parking lot is located south of the runways and connected by shuttle bus to the terminals.

===Bicycle===
Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 can be reached by bicycle because one of the roads that run north of the airport passing the terminals can legally be used by bicycle. The airport authority has confirmed that the newly built terminal 3 will also be reachable by bicycle.

===Bus and coaches===
Various transport companies provide bus services to the airport from the surrounding areas as well as by coach to long-distance destinations.

Previously All Nippon Airways operated a bus service to Düsseldorf exclusively for ANA customers; that way Düsseldorf passengers would be transported to Frankfurt Airport to board their ANA flights. In 2014 ANA established a separate flight from Tokyo to Düsseldorf, causing the bus services to end.

===Ground transport statistics===
In 2006, 29.5% of the 12,299,192 passengers whose air travel originated in Frankfurt came by private car, 27.9% came by rail, 20.4% by taxi, 11.1% parked their car at the airport for the duration of their trip, 5.3% came by bus, and 4.6% arrived with a rental car.

<text>Nando&#x27;s (; ) is a South African multinational fast casual chain that specialises in Portuguese flame-grilled peri-peri style chicken. Founded in Johannesburg in 1987, Nando&#x27;s operates over 1,200 outlets in 30 countries. Their logo depicts the Rooster of Barcelos, one of Portugal&#x27;s most common symbols. The company was wholly owned by Dick Enthoven until his death in 2022, and is now owned by the family.

==History==

The restaurant was founded in 1987 in Rosettenville, Johannesburg by Portuguese-born Fernando Duarte and South African-born Robert Brozin. Upon visiting a Portuguese-Mozambican takeaway named Chickenland and trying the chicken with peri peri, they bought the restaurant for about 80,000 rand (equivalent to about £25,000 at the time). They renamed the restaurant Nando&#x27;s after Fernando&#x27;s firstborn son. By 1989, the restaurant had three outlets in Johannesburg and one in Portugal. Capricorn Ventures International acquired the chain in 1992. In that year, the first branch opened up in Ealing Common where once stood a branch of Midland Bank.

In 2010, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine named Nando&#x27;s one of the world&#x27;s top 30 hottest marketing brands alongside Tata Nano, MTN and Natura. During the same year, the success of Nando&#x27;s in the U.K. led &quot;The Guardian&quot; to write that Nando&#x27;s was a modern restaurant brand that had &quot;changed the face of British fast food.&quot; Nando&#x27;s 1,000th store worldwide opened in 2012. As of July 2014, the Nando&#x27;s restaurant group was ultimately owned by South African businessman Dick Enthoven and his family, through the Luxembourg-domiciled company Yellowwoods. Enthoven&#x27;s son Robby Enthoven, who took over running the restaurants in 1993, was responsible for expanding the Nando&#x27;s chain in the United Kingdom.

In 2018, American-based recruitment website Indeed named Nando&#x27;s as the UK&#x27;s sixth best private sector employer based on millions of employee ratings and reviews.

=== United Kingdom ===

Nando&#x27;s opened its first restaurants within the United Kingdom, in 1992, in the west London suburbs of Ealing and Earls Court, initially focusing on takeaway food. The UK arm, owned by the Enthoven family via a private equity company, struggled until chairman Dick Enthoven put his son Robert in control. The focus then moved from takeaways to a mixed service (counter ordering and table service) model. This decision was taken after Nando&#x27;s partnered with Harrison, a branding and design agency. They also advised Nando&#x27;s to design each restaurant individually so no two restaurants were the same, a brand characteristic of the chain. Nando&#x27;s expanded in the UK in 1993. The company now employs around 8,000 staff in the UK and as of 2013 had over 280 branches, with about sixty serving food conforming with Islamic dietary laws.

In 2010, Nando&#x27;s UK won the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;″s best place to work award in the big company category. Its sauces and marinades were also retailed in UK supermarkets.

Nando&#x27;s claims to have the largest collection of South African art in the UK, with over 5,000 works displayed in restaurants; original artworks are commissioned by the company.

In March 2020, all of Nando&#x27;s UK restaurants closed temporarily due to nationwide lockdown rules introduced by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19. In late April 2020, Nando&#x27;s reopened select locations for delivery and collection services, with many more locations opening throughout May. In early July 2020, the restaurant chain started reopening a few of its outlets for eat-in service.

In August 2021, Nando&#x27;s UK was forced to temporarily close 45 of its 450 restaurants due to a shortage of chicken. A Nando&#x27;s spokesperson said: &quot;The UK food industry has been experiencing disruption across its supply chain in recent weeks due to staff shortages and Covid isolations, and a number of our restaurants have been impacted.&quot;

The UK is Nando&#x27;s largest market.

==Advertising==

=== Australian refugee advertisement ===
In 2002, Nando&#x27;s ran an advertising campaign in Australia based around a political controversy regarding the mandatory detention of refugees. The detainees had been waging a hunger strike campaign, even resorting to sewing their lips closed. Nando&#x27;s adverts proclaimed that the strikers &quot;decided to unsew their lips after hearing the news that with every Nando&#x27;s quarter chicken combo, Nando&#x27;s are giving away an extra quarter chicken free.&quot; Melbourne&#x27;s Sphere Advertising said that the ad was designed to spark controversy, saying that they knew that &quot;there&#x27;s a section of our audience that&#x27;s going to be uncomfortable... but we want to evoke a response.&quot;

=== Malema advertisement ===
During the South African national elections of 2009, Nando&#x27;s made an advert lampooning African National Congress Youth League then president Julius Malema by using a puppet that resembled him. Malema&#x27;s lawyers sued Nando&#x27;s and the original advert was removed. However, an altered version was released, with the puppet&#x27;s face pixelated and the voice altered. The puppet used in the advert was later sold at auction for 100,000 rand, which was donated to an educational charity.

=== &quot;Last dictators&quot; advertisement ===
In 2011, Nando&#x27;s launched a &quot;Last dictators&quot; advert in South Africa. The 60-second commercial shows a sad Robert Mugabe dining alone at Christmas in a large mansion while he reminisces about &quot;happier times&quot; with former dictators, such as playing water tag with Muammar Gaddafi, singing karaoke with Mao Zedong, making snow angels in the sand with Saddam Hussein, pushing P. W. Botha on a swing set, and riding a Covenanter cruiser tank with Idi Amin in a similar fashion to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embracing each other from the film &quot;Titanic&quot;, while the music from &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; is played.

Musekiwa Kumbula, holder of the Nando&#x27;s franchise in Zimbabwe, said his group &quot;strongly feels the advertisement is insensitive and in poor taste.&quot; The advert also offended Chipangano, a Zimbabwean youth militia loyal to Mugabe, who then demanded an apology from Nando&#x27;s, threatened to boycott the South Africa-based chain, and demanded the advert be withdrawn or the restaurant face retribution. Nando&#x27;s South Africa subsequently withdrew the advert citing threats to its staff in Zimbabwe from a youth group.

=== Corporation tax bill ===

Both &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper (UK) and the American non-profit publication &quot;ICIJ&quot; received documents in July 2014 revealing the details of past and present offshore clients of wealth managers Kleinwort Benson, including the Nando&#x27;s restaurant group. &quot;The Guardian&quot; published its belief that, through the use of businesses in Malta, Guernsey and the Netherlands, Enthoven legally reduces the group&#x27;s UK corporation tax bill by &quot;up to a third.&quot; According to the British newspaper, Enthoven&#x27;s profits eventually accumulate in the Kleinwort Benson-managed &quot;Taro III Trust&quot; that is based in Jersey and contains at least £750 million.

While no member of the Enthoven family agreed to speak with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a company representative explained that UK tax laws are not applicable to Enthoven, as &quot;he is not resident in the US or the UK.&quot; The spokesperson also stated that, in the UK, Nando&#x27;s paid corporation tax of £12.6 million on a profit of £58.2 million for the year ending February 2013. In its 2023 tax strategy, the company states that &quot;Nando&#x27;s policy is to maintain its tax affairs responsibly and transparently. Nando&#x27;s doesn’t enter into transactions simply to secure tax advantages.&quot;

<doc id="248291" wikidata="Q7796509" url="?curid=248291" title="Thornton Abbey">
<text>Thornton Abbey was a medieval abbey located close to the small North Lincolnshire village of Thornton Curtis, near Ulceby, and directly south of Hull on the other side of the Humber estuary. Its ruins are a Grade I listed building, including notably England&#x27;s largest and most impressive surviving monastic gatehouse.

It was founded as a priory in 1139 by William le Gros, the Earl of Yorkshire, and raised to the status of abbey in 1148 by Pope Eugene III. It was a house for Augustinian or black canons, who lived a communal life under the Rule of St Augustine but also undertook pastoral duties outside the Abbey. Officers within the abbey included a cellarer, bursar, chamberlain, sacrist, kitchener and an infirmer. A medieval hospital also operated near the abbey, founded no later than 1322.

Due to its involvement in the area&#x27;s burgeoning wool trade, Thornton was a wealthy and prestigious house, with a considerable annual income in 1534 of . The abbey was closed in 1539 by Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It survived by becoming a Secular College, until Secular Colleges were also closed, in 1547.

Thornton Abbey railway station is nearby.

==Later history==
Since the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the site has been owned by: Henry Randes (the Bishop of Lincoln); Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby; Sir Vincent Skinner of Westminster (in 1602); Sir Robert Sutton; George Appleby; and in 1816 Charles, 1st Baron Yarborough.

In May 1859, members of the Lincoln Diocesan Architectural Society visited the site and were given a guided tour by the Rev. J. Byron of North Killingholme. A report of the tour, published by the &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot;, records that access to site had been restricted due to damage &quot;by bands of modern Vandals&quot;. Brass effigies, some in place, others &quot;strewed amongst the growing grass&quot;, and the entrance to a subterranean passageway were also observed.

In 1938, Sackville Pelham, 5th Earl of Yarborough handed the care of the abbey remains to the Office of Works. The site is currently in the care of English Heritage and open to the public. It is necessary to book a visit in advance, and the interior spaces are closed at present.

==Architecture==
The founding abbey building from the 12th century was Romanesque in style, but nothing of it remains above ground. The later abbey from the 13th/14th centuries was built in Early Gothic style. Little remains of the building, except for three walls of the chapter house and part of the cloister, though the ground plan of the abbey is traced out.

The main interest lies in the gatehouse which is among the earliest large-scale uses of brick in England. It stands three storeys high and is structurally intact. There are few windows in the building, and the internal dimensions are cramped due to the thickness of the walls. The outside of the building is adorned with three almost life-size statues directly above the gate. A bridge over the moat adjoins the gatehouse and is fortified with walls and garderobes.

The nearby Abbot&#x27;s Lodge is also a Grade I listed building. Elements of the ground floor of the monastic range of Thornton Abbey were converted to a house and the first floor rebuilt in the 17th century, reputedly by Sir Vincent Skinner, but the structure collapsed upon completion.

==Archaeology==
Thornton Abbey was relatively under-examined for its size and importance, until English Heritage launched a programme of research beginning in 2007. This initial non-invasive research was followed by excavations performed by the University of Sheffield Department of Archaeology between 2011 and 2016, directed by Hugh Willmott.

In 2013, continuing excavation work uncovered a Black Death plague pit in the cemetery of the abbey&#x27;s hospital, containing the remains of at least 48 individuals including the skeletons of 27 children. DNA was successfully extracted and tested positive for &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, the bacterium responsible for the plague, making this the first instance in Britain of a Black Death mass grave found in a rural, rather than urban, area. Willmott stated: &quot;The finding of a previously unknown and completely unexpected mass burial dating to this period in a quiet corner of rural Lincolnshire is thus far unique, and sheds light into the real difficulties faced by a small community ill-prepared to face such a devastating threat.&quot;

<text>In sports, a division is a group of teams who compete against each other for a championship.

==League system==
In sports using a league system (also known as a pyramid structure), a division consists of a group of teams who play a sport at a similar competitive level. Teams can move up to a higher division of play or drop down to a lower one via the process of promotion and relegation, based on their performance in the standings at the end of the season. The existence of divisions based on level of competition ensures that teams at one competitive level can play other teams at a similar competitive level, thus creating parity and more exciting matches.

==Franchise system==
In North America, where sports usually operate on a franchise system rather than a league system, a division is a group of teams within a league which is organized along geographical lines rather than competitive success. Teams based in cities that are in a particular region of the continent are grouped together in the same division. For instance, in Major League Baseball, both the American and National Leagues have East, Central, and West divisions; the teams in each division are mostly (but not always) located in the eastern, central, and western sections of North America respectively. In a franchise system, teams are not promoted or relegated as are teams in a league system. All teams in the league (and by extension, the divisions of the league) are at the same competitive level and remain so year after year.

North American professional sports leagues often construct their season schedules in a way such that teams in a division play matches against each other more often than other teams in the league. This not only has the effect of reducing travel costs, but also creates exciting rivalries between the teams in the division. Moreover, the top teams in a division qualify for the postseason playoff tournament that crowns the league champion, which heightens the rivalries between the teams in a division.

Geographically-based divisions can become skewed if an expansion team joins the league or if one of the franchises within a division moves to another city, necessitating a shuffling or realignment of the teams in a division. Furthermore, the results of the realignment may not always reflect geographical realities. For instance, in 1995, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) moved to St. Louis, Missouri and became the St. Louis Rams. The team retained its place in the NFC West division despite the fact that St. Louis is further east than Dallas, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys. Although Dallas is located in the south-central United States, the Cowboys are a member of the NFC East division due to their long-standing rivalries with the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Commanders, all of whom are located on the Eastern seaboard.

==U.S. college sports==
In U.S. college sports, a &quot;division&quot; has a meaning different from either sense listed above, although somewhat closer to that of the league system.

The major governing bodies for college sports, the NCAA and NAIA, divide their member schools into large competitive groups. These groups are much larger than divisions in either the league or franchise system—for example, the NCAA&#x27;s highest competitive level, Division I, has more than 300 member schools. The vast majority of teams are members of conferences, smaller groupings that usually have between 6 and 14 members. Conference champions, plus selected other teams, compete in national championship tournaments (with the exception of schools in the highest level of NCAA (American) football, which have never had an NCAA-recognized national championship).

As an example, the NCAA is split into three divisions:

* Division I – Usually the largest and most prominent schools, with the largest athletic budgets. All Division I member schools are allowed to award athletic scholarships to students, although some schools and conferences voluntarily choose not to award athletic scholarships in some or all sports (most notably the Ivy League, which prohibits such scholarships in all sports).
* Division II – Generally smaller schools that do not choose to take on the sometimes-massive expense of Division I athletics. The NCAA allows D-II schools to award scholarships, but places much more stringent limits on the amount of athletic aid awarded than at the D-I level.
* Division III – Schools, usually but not always small institutions, at which intercollegiate sports is treated more as a regular student activity. In keeping with this philosophy, the NCAA prohibits Division III schools from awarding athletic scholarships.

===&quot;Division&quot; within conferences===
The term &quot;division&quot; is also used in US college sports to indicate the groupings of members of a given conference. However, this usage is more recent. The first conference to divide its teams into divisions was the Southeastern Conference which, upon expanding to 12 members in 1992, divided into Eastern and Western divisions. Other conferences have undergone similar expansion and division. The usage in the section above is still maintained. For example, the Georgia Bulldogs are in Division I, but are also in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference.

<doc id="248297" wikidata="Q2320305" url="?curid=248297" title="Patricia Routledge">
<text>Dame Katherine Patricia Routledge ( ; born 17 February 1929) is an English actress and singer, best known for her comedy role as Hyacinth Bucket in the popular BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; (1990–1995), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1992 and 1993.

Routledge made her professional stage debut at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1952 and her Broadway debut in &quot;How&#x27;s the World Treating You&quot; in 1966. She won the 1968 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in &quot;Darling of the Day&quot;, and the 1988 Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for &quot;Candide&quot;. Her film appearances include &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River&quot; (1968).

On television, Routledge came to prominence during the 1980s in monologues written by Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood; appearing in Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1982), as Kitty in &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; (1985–1986), and being nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads: A Lady of Letters&quot; (1988). She also starred as Hetty Wainthropp in the British television series &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; (1990, 1996–1998). In 2017, she was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II for her services to entertainment and charity.

==Early life==
Routledge was born on 17 February 1929 in Tranmere in Birkenhead, Cheshire. Her father was a haberdasher and gentlemen&#x27;s outfitter. She was educated at Birkenhead High School, and the University of Liverpool. She gained a degree with honours in English Language and Literature. She was involved in the university&#x27;s dramatic society, where she worked closely with the academic Edmund Colledge, who both directed and acted in several of the society&#x27;s productions. It was Colledge who persuaded her to pursue an acting career. After graduating, she trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and returned to Liverpool to begin her acting career at the Liverpool Playhouse.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Routledge has had a long career in theatre, particularly musical theatre, in the United Kingdom and the United States. Her vocal range was labelled as a mezzo-soprano and a contralto. She has been a long-standing member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), appearing in such acclaimed productions as the 1984 &quot;Richard III&quot;, which starred Antony Sher in the title role. Her West End credits include &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Cowardy Custard&quot;, &quot;Virtue in Danger&quot;, &quot;Noises Off&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, and &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot;, as well as a number of less successful vehicles. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her work in &quot;And a Nightingale Sang&quot; in 1979. A classically trained singer, she has occasionally made forays into operetta including taking the title role in an acclaimed production of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein&quot; at the 1978 Camden Festival; &quot;As the Grand Duchess she invested every phrase, spoken or sung... with wit and meaning, and coloured her tone to express a wide variety of emotions. Never did she resort to the hoydenish behaviour that this role – in British productions at least – seems to invite.&quot;

Routledge made her Broadway debut in Roger Milner&#x27;s comedy &quot;How&#x27;s the World Treating You?&quot; in 1966, returning in the short-lived 1968 musical &quot;Darling of the Day&quot;, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, sharing the honour with Leslie Uggams of &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; Following this, Routledge had roles in several more unsuccessful Broadway productions including a musical called &quot;Love Match&quot;, in which she played Queen Victoria; the legendary 1976 Leonard Bernstein flop &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&quot;, in which she portrayed every U.S. First Lady from Abigail Adams to Eleanor Roosevelt; and a 1981 musical, &quot;Say Hello to Harvey&quot; – based on the Mary Coyle Chase play &quot;Harvey&quot; (1944) – which closed in Toronto before reaching New York City.

In 1980, Routledge played Ruth in the Joseph Papp production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, co-starring American actor Kevin Kline and pop vocalist Linda Ronstadt, at the Delacorte Theatre in New York City&#x27;s Central Park, one of a series of Shakespeare in the Park summer events. The show was a hit and transferred to Broadway the following January, with Estelle Parsons replacing Routledge. A DVD of the Central Park production, with Routledge, was released in October 2002. She also performed in &quot;Façade&quot; at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Recital Hall.

Routledge won a Laurence Olivier Award in 1988 for her portrayal of the Old Lady in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; in the London cast of the critically acclaimed Scottish Opera production. One critic noted &quot;She stopped the show with &#x27;I am so easily assimilated&#x27;, and her long narration worked on at least two levels – it was both hilarious and oddly moving.&quot; She also played the role of Nettie Fowler to great acclaim in the 1992 National Theatre production of &quot;Carousel&quot;. In a 2006 Hampstead Theatre production of &quot;The Best of Friends&quot;, she portrayed Dame Laurentia McLachlan. In 2008, she played Queen Mary in Royce Ryton&#x27;s play &quot;Crown Matrimonial&quot;. More recent work includes the role of Dame Myra Hess in the tribute show &quot;Admission: One Shilling&quot; from 2009, the narrator in &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; with the Nash Ensemble in 2010, and Lady Markby in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2014.

Since 2009, Routledge has toured with a show entitled &quot;Facing The Music&quot;. The show features insights into her musical theatre career.

===Film and television===
Routledge&#x27;s screen credits include &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967), &quot;Pretty Polly&quot; (1967), &quot;30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia&quot;, &quot;The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River&quot; (all 1968), &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; (1969) and &quot;Girl Stroke Boy&quot; (1971).

Routledge&#x27;s early television appearances included a role in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, in the episode &quot;Seance in a Wet Rag and Bone Yard&quot; (1974), as a clairvoyant called Madame Fontana. She also appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1961), followed by the role of Maggie in ITV&#x27;s Play of the Week &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (opposite Michael Caine as Will Mosop) (1962), and as a white witch in &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1971). Routledge played Mrs. Jennings in the BBC mini-series production of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1971). However, she did not come to prominence on television until she featured in monologues written for her by Alan Bennett and later Victoria Wood in the 1980s. She first appeared in &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;, the second installment of Bennett&#x27;s anthology, &quot;Objects of Affection&quot; in 1982. She then played the opinionated Kitty in &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; in 1985. She performed two further monologues in Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; in 1988 and 1998. Routledge was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for the monologue &quot;A Lady of Letters&quot;.

In 1990, Routledge accepted the lead role of Hetty Wainthropp in an ITV mystery drama, &quot;Hetty Wainthropp: Missing Persons&quot;. ITV opted not to pursue a series after the pilot episode, but in 1996 the BBC produced the first series of &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;, with Routledge again in the lead role. The show co-starred Dominic Monaghan as her assistant and Derek Benfield as her husband. It was first aired in January 1996, and ran until the autumn of 1998. Monaghan, who went on to enjoy a Hollywood career, has since credited Routledge as &quot;an amazing teacher&quot; who taught him some &quot;very valuable lessons&quot; in acting.

In 1990, Routledge was cast as Hyacinth Bucket in the comedy series &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. She portrayed a formerly working-class woman with social pretensions (insisting her surname be pronounced &quot;bouquet&quot;) and delusions of grandeur (her oft-mentioned &quot;candlelight suppers&quot;). Routledge delighted in portraying Hyacinth, as she claimed she &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand people like her&quot; in real life. In 1991, she won a British Comedy Award for her portrayal, and she was later nominated for two BAFTA TV Awards in 1992 and 1993. Routledge quit the role in 1995, despite the series&#x27; ongoing popularity, as she wished to pursue other roles as an actress. In a 2017 interview, Routledge said: &quot;I always thought of the great, great Ronnie Barker. He always left something when he was on a high, and it&#x27;s much better to have people say now &#x27;Oh, why didn&#x27;t you do some more?&#x27; than having them say &#x27;Oh, is that still on?&#x27;&quot; Another reason she wished to leave the role was that she felt that the writer Roy Clarke was &quot;recycling some old ideas that we&#x27;d already dealt with&quot;.

Routledge has also played several real-life characters for television, including Barbara Pym and in a dramatised BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; biographical documentary of 1994 about Hildegard of Bingen.

In 2001, Routledge starred in &quot;Anybody&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, a fact-based television drama in which she played Sheila Bowler, a mother and piano teacher who served four years in prison for murdering her elderly aunt, but was later acquitted following a retrial.

In 2016, Routledge presented &quot;Beatrix Potter with Patricia Routledge&quot; on Channel 4, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Potter&#x27;s birth.

In January 2023, Channel 5 aired a 67-minute special &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; retrospective for their series &quot;30 Years Of Laughs&quot;. Cast, crew and celebrities paid tribute to the show. The documentary featured an interview with Routledge, who was 93 at the time, sharing her memories of the show, along with supporting cast members Judy Cornwell, Jeremy Gittins and David Janson.

===Radio and audio books===
In 1966, Routledge sang the role of Mad Margaret in &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, the title role in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, and Melissa in &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, in a series of BBC Radio Gilbert and Sullivan recordings. She took part in a studio broadcast of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Vakula the Smith&quot; (narrating excerpts from the work by Gogol) in 1989. In 2006, she was featured in an episode of the &quot;Stage and Screen&quot; series on Radio 3.

Routledge&#x27;s extensive radio credits include several Alan Bennett plays and the BBC dramatisation of Carole Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Ladies of Letters&quot;, in which she and Prunella Scales play retired women exchanging humorous correspondence over the course of several years. A tenth series of &quot;Ladies of Letters&quot; premiered on BBC Radio 4 in 2009.

Radio work prior to 1985 included &quot;Private Lives&quot;, &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot;.

Having a distinctive voice, Routledge has also recorded and released a variety of audiobooks including unabridged readings of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and abridged novelisations of the Hetty Wainthropp series.

==Personal life==
Routledge has never married and has no children. In a 2001 interview, she said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t make a decision not to be married and not to be a mother. Life just turned out like that because my involvement in acting was so total.&quot; In the same interview, Routledge discussed two affairs she had been involved in: one with a married man while in her late 20s and the other being some years later with a man directing a play she was appearing in.

She has lived in Chichester since 2000 and regularly worships at Chichester Cathedral. In 2020, she helped raise £10,000 towards the restoration of the cathedral roof.

Routledge is a patron of the Beatrix Potter Society and an ambassador for the charity Royal Voluntary Service, previously known as WRVS.

Routledge was a close friend of former Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd. Her recording of &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; was played at Boothroyd&#x27;s funeral in March 2023.

==Honours==
Routledge was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 Birthday Honours, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours, and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to theatre and charity.

In 2008, Routledge received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Lancaster University for her contribution to drama and theatre.

On 15 March 2019, Routledge received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Chester at Chester Cathedral for her contributions to theatre and television.

In 2022, the Royal Academy of Music conferred Routledge with honorary membership.

An honorary president of the Association of English Singers &amp; Speakers (which exists to &quot;encourage communication of English words in speech and song with clarity, understanding and imagination&quot;), she has sponsored the annual AESS National English Song Prize from 2003 to the present.

She was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Wirral on 17 January 2025.

<text>As It Happens is a Canadian interview show that airs on CBC Radio One in Canada and various public radio stations in the United States through Public Radio Exchange. Its 50th anniversary was celebrated on-air on November 16, 2018. It has been one of the most popular and acclaimed shows on CBC Radio.

The bulk of the program consists of a CBC journalist, currently Nil Köksal since 2022, conducting telephone interviews with newsmakers and other persons of interest. The other co-host, Chris Howden as of January 6, 2020, introduces the interviews and other segments, such as &quot;For the Record&quot; recordings of speeches or press conferences, and musical interludes (or as former co-host Barbara Budd often referred to them, &quot;the dance portion of the program&quot;).

==Stations and time==

The show is broadcast each weekday from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. (half an hour later in Newfoundland) throughout Canada. It used to be widely accessible to much of the northern United States, but as the CBC switched its CBC Radio One from powerful AM signals in Eastern Canadian urban centres to FM stations, it became harder to receive CBC content further away from the border.

&quot;As It Happens&quot; can be heard on CBC Radio One&#x27;s channel 169 on Sirius XM Satellite Radio (in both Canada and the U.S.), on an increasing number of American public radio stations, especially NPR affiliates with news radio formats, via distribution from CBC&#x27;s American distribution partner Public Radio Exchange, and on the Internet via streaming audio at the CBC&#x27;s website. Older broadcasts are available as a stream from the CBC&#x27;s website, but without the music.

&quot;As It Happens&quot; is heard on a delayed-broadcast basis in the United States, generally airing in a later-evening slot and often paired with &quot;Q&quot;; American stations that carry &quot;As It Happens&quot; do not air the final half-hour (7:30 to 8:00 p.m.) of the program.

In the fall of 2009, the show also added an hour long repeat airing at midnight on weeknights called &quot;As It Happens: The Midnight Edition&quot;, which features an abbreviated edition of the 6:30 p.m. broadcast. Thanks to shorter run time, many of the less important interviews and stories are cut from the midnight rerun to fit the reduced air time, so the midnight broadcast is virtually identical to the American NPR edit. However, in the summer months of July and August, the program is reduced to an hour in its regular time slot, which means the midnight edition airs all the content during that period.

During the summer, the program ends at 7:30 and is followed by a half-hour program from the network&#x27;s schedule of short-run summer series. Most summers, one of those summer series is &quot;As It Happened: The Archive Edition&quot;, a separate program which airs previously broadcast interviews from the main series

==History==
The show was introduced in 1968 as a reverse call-in show: rather than having the public call in, the reporters at &quot;As It Happens&quot; called newsmakers and pundits for their opinions.

During the 1970s, the program produced 54-minute-long segments called &quot;As It Happened, (insert year)&quot;, covering the major events of years past, particularly the 1930s and 1940s. During the CBC technicians strike in 1981, after a few weeks of music, the &quot;As It Happened&quot; segments were played each weeknight in chronological order as repeat filler material until the strike was resolved.

When the interviewer is absent, other CBC journalists typically sit in as substitute interviewers; when the announcer is absent, substitutes may include other CBC personalities, actors such as R. H. Thomson, or program staffers; Howden himself sometimes appeared on the program as a guest announcer before being named co-host effective January 6, 2020.

In January 2022, long-time host Carol Off announced her retirement from &quot;As It Happens&quot;, effective February 25. In July 2022, it was announced that Nil Köksal will debut as former host Off&#x27;s successor in September.

====Timeline====


==Notable interviews==
The show has had many notable interviews, including:

* the wife of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn just after his arrest.
* Sandra Good, the best friend of Squeaky Fromme, just after her friend had attempted to shoot Gerald Ford.
* a Rwandan woman seemingly moments away from being killed by Tutsi militia during the 1994 Rwandan genocide—she stayed on the phone with &quot;As It Happens&quot; up to the point when the attackers knocked on her door. She was ultimately spared.

The show has also interviewed a wide array of presidents, prime ministers, terrorists, inventors, and authors.

==Humour==
Despite the gravity of many of its stories, &quot;As It Happens&quot; is also known for being lighthearted and carrying news of the obscure and bizarre. For instance, during the early 1990s there were updates for several years on the battle over a large fibreglass fish that annoyed a neighbour in England. The show opens with humorous synopses of the day&#x27;s stories, which are followed by a pun based on one of the same. An example is &quot;radio that reads between the Linuses,&quot; following a story about baseball stats in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. As it happens, the show&#x27;s title is also a pun.

Former host Barbara Frum once interviewed Cookie Monster from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Another well-remembered interview was with a hard-of-hearing but imperturbable British farmer who had grown a prize-winning giant cabbage. The 1976 interview was conducted by an increasingly frustrated Frum, who could not get the farmer to give any kind of coherent replies to her straightforward questions; by mid-interview, Frum was stuck repeatedly asking the question, &quot;What did you feed your cabbage?&quot; a little bit louder each time. Exasperated, she finally asks him &quot;WHAT. DID. YOU. FEED. THE. GODDAMN. CABBAGE?&quot;. It is still occasionally played as an amusing interlude on the show, as well as on CBC Radio&#x27;s afternoon series &quot;Rewind&quot;.

After Lloyd Robertson left CBC Television for CTV in 1976, the program conducted its own on-air auditions for his replacement as anchor of &quot;The National&quot;, eventually choosing Robert Stanfield as its nominee.

Barbara Budd and Mary Lou Finlay maintained a recurring debate over whether ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was an appropriate choice of bumper music between interviews, and Budd and Carol Off later solicited listener feedback to determine the world&#x27;s most annoying song. On one occasion when Budd was away on a sick leave that coincided with April Fools&#x27; Day, she and Finlay arranged a prank in which Budd gave an interview explaining that she had been given a Canada Council grant to tour the world visiting all the cities whose names she had ever mispronounced on the air.

Following Finlay&#x27;s retirement in 2005, she published &quot;The As It Happens Files&quot;, a memoir of her time with the program. The book was subtitled &quot;Radio That May Contain Nuts&quot;.

===Distance from Reading===
A frequently-cited example of the show&#x27;s sometimes whimsical sense of humour relates to references to the UK town of Reading, Berkshire. After almost any lighter news story or interview that emanates from any location in the UK, the &quot;As It Happens&quot; host will conclude the piece by straight-facedly noting how far the UK location is from Reading, frequently giving the distance in both miles and some other form of strange, non-standard measurement (e.g., 733,000 garden gnomes, lined up hat to hat).

This long-standing tradition on the show dates from the mid-1970s, when English-born segment producer George Somerwill once concluded a program script with a note that a small village mentioned in the preceding segment was located &#x27;nine miles from Reading&#x27;. This note, intended as a serious clarification, was totally baffling to most Canadian listeners—and even to the rest of the show&#x27;s staff. It quickly became a running joke on the show to identify all places in the UK (even major centres like London) in relation to their proximity to the comparatively obscure borough of Reading.

In her 2009 book &quot;The As It Happens Files&quot;, former show host Mary Lou Finlay notes that &quot;As It Happens&quot; had given a boost not just to Reading&#x27;s profile, but also to its economy: a number of Canadian fans of the show made a point of visiting Reading when they are visiting the UK.

==Christmas and Hanukkah readings==

During the holiday season in late November and December each year, the show also maintains a tradition of airing one or more Christmas and Hanukkah themed stories narrated by past or present announcers. Alan Maitland&#x27;s reading of Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;The Shepherd&quot; is always played on the last show before Christmas Day, and Maitland&#x27;s reading of O. Henry&#x27;s &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; remains a popular staple of the program, as do Barbara Budd&#x27;s narrations of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; and Aubrey Davis&#x27; &quot;Bone Button Borscht&quot;.

==Music==
The original opening and closing themes were &quot;Curried Soul&quot; and &quot;Koff Drops&quot; respectively, played by jazz musician Moe Koffman. The second segment of the show begins with a 1987 rearrangement of &quot;Curried Soul&quot; by Billy Bryans.

In September 2013, amidst much on-air fanfare, the decades-old &quot;Curried Soul&quot; opening theme was given a discreetly modernized remix by Socalled. During phone-in segments broadcast in the days following the new theme&#x27;s premiere, listener reaction was mixed: some preferred the newer mix, while others stated their preference for the original 1969 recording. When Socalled appeared on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; as a musical guest in June 2015, Off and Douglas joined him for a live performance of the song, with Douglas playing a shaker and Off playing cowbell.

On extraordinary news occasions, the show may also broadcast alternate opening and closing theme music more reflective of a major news story, or may entirely skip opening theme music. For example, on the December 5, 2013 episode marking the death of Nelson Mandela, the show opened and closed with Ladysmith Black Mambazo&#x27;s recording of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;; on the October 22, 2014 episode covering the Parliament Hill shootings, the show opened with a montage of audio clips of the day&#x27;s events, entirely skipping theme music; and on the November 11, 2016 episode following the death of Canadian musical and literary icon Leonard Cohen, the show opened with Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;.

==Awards==
In 2005, the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada honoured Barbara Frum for her time with &quot;As It Happens&quot;.

<text>Visionary art is art that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of awareness including spiritual or mystical themes, or is based in such experiences.

==History==
The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art. Its artists included Ernst Fuchs, Rudolf Hausner, Arik Brauer, Wolfgang Hutter and Anton Lehmden among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including Mati Klarwein, Robert Venosa, and De Es Schwertberger.

==Definition==

Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness. Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art &#x27;scene&#x27; and which artists can be considered especially influential. Symbolism, Cubism, Surrealism and Psychedelic art are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count Hilma af Klint, Hieronymous Bosch, William Blake, Morris Graves (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), Emil Bisttram, and Gustave Moreau amongst their antecedents.

==Schools and organizations==
The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, which includes Ernst Fuchs and Arik Brauer, is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

The Society for the Art of Imagination, founded by Brigid Marlin serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern cooperatives involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as Burning Man and Boom Festival, and exhibition/ritual spaces such as Temple of Visions and the Interdimensional Art Movement.

The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, is a museum devoted entirely to visionary art.

<text>Velvet Tone Records was an American record label that was founded by Columbia Records in 1925 and closed in 1932. Velvet Tone featured material identical to that of Columbia&#x27;s two other low price labels, Harmony Records and Diva Records (and after Diva was discontinued, Clarion Records).

==Popular culture==
* In Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 film, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, Mary can be seen playing a record with a &quot;Velvet Tone&quot; label on the phonograph. A close examination reveals that it is &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; performed by &quot;Arthur Black and His Orchestra&quot;. However, the label&#x27;s design is inconsistent with actual Velvet Tone labels. The prop record is a nod towards the film&#x27;s assistant director, Arthur Black.

<doc id="248314" wikidata="Q156669" url="?curid=248314" title="Ebenaceae">
<text>The Ebenaceae are a family of flowering plants belonging to order Ericales. The family includes ebony and persimmon among about 768 species of trees and shrubs. It is distributed across the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world. It is most diverse in the rainforests of Malesia, India, Thailand, tropical Africa and tropical America. 

Many species are valued for their wood, particularly ebony, for fruit, and as ornamental plants.

==Biology==
The fruits contain tannins, a plant defense against herbivory, so they are often avoided by animals when unripe. The ripe fruits of many species are a food source for diverse animal taxa. The foliage is consumed by insects.

The plants may have a strong scent. Some species have aromatic wood. They are important and conspicuous trees in many of their native ecosystems, such as lowland dry forests of the former Maui Nui in Hawaii, Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests, Khathiar–Gir dry deciduous forests, Louisiade Archipelago rain forests, Madagascar lowland forests, Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests, New Guinea mangroves, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests.

Ebony is a dense black wood taken from several species in the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot;, including &quot;Diospyros ebenum&quot; (Ceylon ebony, Indian ebony), &quot;Diospyros crassiflora&quot; (West African ebony, Benin ebony), and &quot;Diospyros celebica&quot; (Makassar ebony). &quot;Diospyros tesselaria&quot; (Mauritius ebony) was heavily exploited by the Dutch in the 17th century.

==Description==
The family includes trees and shrubs. The leaves are usually alternately arranged, but some species have opposite or whorled leaves. The inflorescence is usually a cyme of flowers, sometimes a raceme or a panicle, and some plants produce solitary flowers. Most species are dioecious. The flower has 3 to 8 petals, which are joined at the bases. There are usually several single or paired stamens, which are often attached to the inner wall of the corolla. Female flowers have up to 8 stigmas. The calyx is persistent. The fruits are berry-like or capsular. Like the wood of some species, the roots and bark may be black in color.

==Etymology==
The family name Ebenaceae is based on the genus name &quot;Ebenus&quot;, published by Otto Kuntze in 1891. It is a later homonym of &quot;Ebenus&quot; L., a genus already named in the family Fabaceae, and is thus &quot;nomen illegitimum&quot;. The plant that Kuntze had named &quot;Ebenus&quot; was accordingly reassigned to the genus &quot;Maba&quot;, which in turn has since been included in the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot;.

Because the name Ebenaceae had become well known, having been used in major botanical references such as Bentham and Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, Engler and Prantl&#x27;s &quot;Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien&quot;, and Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Families of Flowering Plants&quot;, it was conserved and is therefore legitimate.

==Genera==
During the last century, seven genera have been included in the family at one time or another. One phylogenetic analysis reduced the family to four genera:

<text>An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act of personal artistic expression. Art cars are often driven and owned by their creators, who are sometimes referred to as &quot;Cartists&quot;.

Most car artists are ordinary people with no artistic training. Artists are largely self-taught and self funded, though some mainstream trained artists have also worked in the art car medium. Most car artists agree that creating and driving an art car daily is its own reward. Artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and others have designed BMW Art Cars and their work has been reflected in racing cars like the BMW V12 LMR. 
==History==

The art car subculture started with several influences - the hippie-themed VWs of the late 1960s, the lowrider, as well as a Merry Pranksters&#x27; creation, the decorated school bus known as &quot;Furthur.&quot;

During the late 1960s, singer Janis Joplin had a psychedelically-painted Porsche 356 and John Lennon had a psychedelic Rolls-Royce. Partly in imitation, the late 1960s/early 1970s counterculture featured many painted VW Buses (sometimes with a peace symbol in place of the giant VW logo) and customized vehicles (e.g. a customized 1977 Cadillac Fleetwood seen in the film &quot;Escape from New York&quot;). Likewise, as a way of evading The Muppet Movie&#x27;s main antagonist &quot;Doc Hopper&quot;, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem paint up the borrowed 1951 &quot;bullet-nose&quot; Studebaker Commander two-door owned by Fozzie Bear&#x27;s uncle in a psychedelic manner, for Fozzie and Kermit the Frog to escape safely, at least for a while.

Artist Larry Fuente was among the first to take motorized appliqué to the limit with his &quot;Mad Cad.&quot; Later, artists David Best and Jackie Harris contributed their works to the art car world.
An art car community began to cohere in the 1990s, inspired by movies and books with a wide underground following, and the development of innovative art display venues such as Burning Man. One of the main forces behind this is filmmaker and art car artist Harrod Blank, who created the art car documentaries &quot;Wild Wheels&quot; (1992), &quot;Driving The Dream&quot; (1998) and &quot;Automorphosis&quot; (2009). He also published two books &quot;Wild Wheels&quot; (1993, 2001) and &quot;Art Cars: the cars, the artists, the obsession, the craft&quot; (2002, 2007, 2012). Blank also co-founded ArtCar Fest with Philo Northrup in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was the United States&#x27; second largest art car festival.

Gloworama, a 2010 New Year&#x27;s Eve event in Houston, Texas, had over 100 illuminated entrants. It was produced by ArtX. The illuminated parade also drew the attention of the Galveston, Texas-based business Yaga&#x27;s Entertainment, Inc. (the contract holder of Mardi Gras! Galveston 2011–2015) as part of their five-year contract signed on 18 November 2010.A well known early art car used for commercial advertisement was the &quot;Oscar Mayer Wienie Wagon&quot;—Later versions were known as the Wienermobile. These are bus-sized vehicles styled to appear as a hot dog on a bun. Commercial use of the art car has become popular in the 20th and continues into the 21st century. At the same time visionary applications including cars transformed into religious shrines continues to place visionary self-taught artists, student artists and corporate artists side by side on the road and at art car events.

The art car culture was once strongest throughout Texas and the Southeast but now it extends throughout the United States and art car events can be found in many major cities as well as in small country towns. Art cars now very evident in the East, with a large event often held in Baltimore. In Canada, art cars are popular in British Columbia and also in the western Canadian plains with shows in Nanaimo, British Columbia and Regina, Saskatchewan. Other cars can be found throughout the world, most recently in Europe with the European arm of car-hire firm Avis supporting the movement.

==Artistic styles==

Art cars are public and mobile expressions of the artistic need to create. Often these days art cars derive their inspiration from popular culture. Others however, are created by visionary artists in order to express complex visions, philosophies and ideas. There is a wide and varied spectrum of purpose found in art cars. In creating an art car, the &quot;exteriors and interiors of factory-made automobiles are transformed into expressions of individual ideas, values, beliefs and dreams. The cars range from imaginatively painted vehicles to extravagant fantasies whose original bodies are concealed beneath newly sculptured shells&quot;.
Later themes have become more widely focused and more satirical or dark. Science fiction themes (monsters, giant insects from Them!, flying saucers), surrealism, and expressions of the Gothic and the sublime, are not uncommon. In parades and shows, &quot;arted&quot; bicycles or motor-scooters or costumed roller-skaters may also weave among the art cars. Some art car owners incorporate elements of music or street theater in their presentation.

For cars to be roadworthy, artistic style must be kept with the constraints of the law. This generally means keeping turn signals and windows clear, license plates visible, and not extending beyond the width of a normal car frame.

<text>TechTV was a 24-hour cable and satellite channel based in San Francisco featuring news and shows about computers, technology, and the Internet. In 2004, it merged with the G4 gaming channel which ultimately dissolved TechTV programming. At the height of its six-year run, TechTV was broadcast in 70 countries, reached 43 million households, and claimed 1.9 million unique visitors monthly to its website. A focus on personality-driven product reviews and technical support made it a cultural hub for technology information worldwide, still existing today online through its former hosts&#x27; webcasts, most notably the TWiT Network.

The offices were located at 650 Townsend Street, 94103, and the studios, of which there were two, were located at 535 York Street, 94110.

==History==
===Origins===
On August 20, 1994, computer magazine publisher Ziff Davis entered the television industry with the premiere of &quot;The Personal Computing Show&quot;, a program that aired on Saturday mornings on CNBC, America&#x27;s Talking and the Jones Computing Network. &quot;The Personal Computing Show&quot;, co-hosted by Jim Louderback and Gina Smith, targeted a growing demographic of personal computer owners and demonstrated how to purchase, install, maintain and repair personal computers and peripheral devices such as printers. Shortly after &quot;The Personal Computing Show&quot;″s premiere, Ziff Davis revealed plans to produce a second show in October 1994 named &quot;PC Update&quot;, a half-hour Sunday morning news program hosted by Leo Laporte and focusing on the computer industry. According to Ziff Davis spokesman Gregory Jarboe, &quot;The Personal Computing Show&quot; was unsuccessful due to its relegation to odd channels and timeslots. When Ziff Davis&#x27; sale to investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Company was announced in October 1994, a small Foster City-based television operation named &quot;ZD-TV&quot; was listed as a company asset.

In April 1996, Ziff Davis announced the establishment of ZDTV as a San Francisco-based unit specializing in the production of television and internet broadcasts, which would allow the publisher to showcase its products. Its first project was to develop &quot;The Site&quot;, a daily hour-long prime time news show co-hosted by Soledad O&#x27;Brien about the increasing social and economic effects of technology. The program aired on the cable news network MSNBC, which launched on July 15, 1996. It was the third San Francisco-based television program specializing in technology after &quot;CNET Central&quot; and &quot;Cyberlife&quot;. According to Ziff Davis chief executive Larry Wangberg, San Francisco was chosen as ZDTV&#x27;s headquarters for its proximity to Silicon Valley and easy access to Multimedia Gulch-based talent.

On May 6, 1997, Ziff Davis announced its plan to launch ZDTV as a 24-hour interactive cable network specializing in computers and the Internet. The publisher put $100 million behind the project and planned to debut the ZDTV channel in early 1998. Projected programming for the channel included talk shows on the impact of technology, business-oriented shows evaluating investments in high-tech stocks, and reviews of software and hardware. Children&#x27;s programming was also planned for the weekends. The channel had 11 initial charter advertisers, including IBM, Gateway 2000, Microsoft, and Charles Schwab. Ziff Davis chairman and CEO Eric Hippeau cited the increasing presence of computers in cable television homes and workspaces as motivation for filling the niche of programming about computers, saying &quot;This is a huge audience and it will only get bigger&quot;. Wangberg, who would be made the network&#x27;s CEO, proclaimed Ziff Davis&#x27; ambition of ZDTV becoming &quot;to computing what CNN is to news, what ESPN is to sports&quot;. Although Ziff Davis intended to continue producing &quot;The Site&quot; for MSNBC following ZDTV&#x27;s launch, the show was canceled in September 1997 as a result of the network&#x27;s shift toward an all-news format. In December 1997, Ziff Davis revealed at the Western Cable Trade Show in Anaheim that it had secured agreements with four cable operators to carry the network: Prime Cable in Las Vegas, Harron Communications in Detroit, Televue in Georgia, and Prestige Cable in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. 

===ZDTV===

ZDTV was initially set to launch at the end of 1998&#x27;s first quarter, but was delayed by Ziff Davis&#x27; initial public offering, which was announced on February 18. The network launched on Monday May 11, 1998, on cable systems in Las Vegas, Detroit, parts of Georgia near Atlanta and parts of Maine. On August 1, 1998, ZDTV was broadcast in its native San Francisco when the channel struck a deal with DirecTV to become available on Channel 273 via the providers&#x27; satellite dishes. In November 1998, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen&#x27;s holding company Vulcan Ventures invested $54 million in ZDTV, granting it a 33 percent stake in the network.

Although ZDTV was critically acclaimed, it struggled to gain a foothold in AT&amp;T/TCI cable lineups, and was deemed unprofitable. In an effort to sell company assets to reduce debt and boost its share price, Ziff Davis put ZDTV up for sale on July 16, 1999. In November 1999, Vulcan purchased the remaining two-thirds in a transaction that was completed on January 21, 2000. The deal (which permitted the network to retain its name) was worth $204.8 million. On August 21, 2000, ZDTV announced that it would be changing its name to TechTV the following month, and would simultaneously be added to AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable&#x27;s digital cable lineups.

===TechTV===
On March 15, 2001, TechTV announced that it had laid off an approximate of a dozen employees as part of a reorganization effort in the face of the waning dot-com bubble. On April 2, the nine-hour live programming block &quot;Tech Live&quot;, which the network described as the &quot;nucleus of TechTV&#x27;s daytime programming&quot;, was launched.

On November 16, TechTV announced another layoff of 130 employees. This, combined with the reduction of &quot;Tech Live&quot; and indifferent online reactions to TechTV&#x27;s struggles, were interpreted by &quot;Wired News&quot;&#x27; Farhad Manjoo as a sign of declining cultural interest in technology. Anonymous TechTV employees remarked that the increasingly ubiquitous nature of the Internet had rendered the network&#x27;s mission statement &quot;a bit fantastical&quot;, and suggested that the only reason the network was still in business was because &quot;Allen doesn&#x27;t know what to do with his billions&quot;. In the spring of 2002, &quot;TechLive&quot; was cut further into just one thirty-minute daily news magazine show, with a focus less on tech news and more on technology&#x27;s cultural aspect. In 2002, &quot;Silicon Spin&quot; (an opinion forum hosted by PC Magazine editor John C. Dvorak from the original ZDTV launched in May 1998) and &quot;AudioFile&quot; (a show for digital music enthusiasts launched in August 2000) were canceled, with its hosts being absorbed onto other network programs. 2003 saw the introduction of several new shows (such as &quot;Performance&quot;, &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, and &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;).

TechTV was also broadcast over the air on KTQW in Wichita, Kansas until the TechTV name was dropped during the G4 merger.

===International distribution===
A Canadian version of TechTV launched on September 7, 2001, as a joint venture of TechTV, Rogers Media, and Shaw Communications. The channel would later become G4techTV Canada to coincide with the American merger of TechTV and G4. The channel would change its name once again in mid-2009 to G4 Canada. In 2004, TechTV launched on Foxtel Digital in Australia. After the merger with G4, TechTV (then called G4techTV) left Australia lineups as its international feed ceased. On Malaysia&#x27;s ASTRO platform, repeats of the international feed was run for some time after the international feed ceased before starting to import G4TV programming and retransmitting them locally on the same channel as the public educational service TV Pendidikan from 2002 to 2006. In Japan, Sony&#x27;s So-net channel aired several TechTV programs until the fall of 2005 (they aired reruns after May 2004). In New Zealand, TechTV aired on Saturn Communications&#x27;s channel 34 until May 2004. In addition to those countries, TechTV was broadcast internationally in the United Kingdom.

===Merger and consolidation===
On March 25, 2004, Comcast&#x27;s G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and Leo Laporte, who, because of a contract dispute with Vulcan, left the channel. Shows with Laporte, including &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; and Call for Help, continued on with remaining staff taking over his hosting duties.

Around May 6, 2004, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 16, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4&#x27;s main office in Los Angeles if they agreed to relocate there. Shows from TechTV that were not redundant to G4&#x27;s offerings continued on until July, when the closing of the TechTV Offices would close the respective stages for these shows in turn.

On May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world (e.g.: systems with both channels active, systems limiting Comcast&#x27;s number of channels on their lineup, etc.) On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. After the closure deadline passed on July 16, 2004, only Los Angeles produced shows would air on the new channel. The final production originating at TechTV in San Francisco was the September 2, 2004, episode of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; (which was taped on July 16, 2004).

On February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as &quot;G4 – Video Game Television&quot; which also echoed the changes in programming made to the channel due to the merger for both G4&#x27;s original offering and the greatly diminished TechTV originated shows; after that, G4 went through a rebranding and changed most of its programming to position itself as a male-oriented network.

Leo Laporte hosted &quot;Call for Help&quot; which aired until April 6, 2007. It was revamped and renamed &quot;The Lab with Leo Laporte&quot; and was shown on G4techTV Canada and the Australian HOW TO Channel. The show was filmed in HD and Laporte hoped to have it picked up by an American network. The series has since been cancelled due to poor ratings.

Kevin Rose, who worked on &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; and &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;, co-founded Digg which he featured on &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; in 2004, was hired by Google in March 2012, along with many of the employees at Rose&#x27;s mobile app incubator called Milk.

Many of the founding staff of ZDTV had previously worked on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Site&quot;, which featured Dev Null, a virtual animated character voiced by Leo Laporte who interacted with host Soledad O&#x27;Brien. Improving on the technology used for Dev Null, ZDTV created two animated virtual characters who appeared as hosts for the network. Dash (voiced first by Paul McKinney and later by Patrick Flick and Chris Manners, with body performance by Jessa Brie Moreno and Slater Penney) and Tilde (voiced by Kate Botello and later by Laura LeBleu, with body performance by Jessa Brie Moreno and Slater Penney, in some support chat appearances Tilde was played by Theresa Quinn, Asst Production Manager) appeared in on-air and online promos for the network.

==Reunion==
A possible TechTV reunion was announced by Leo Laporte in his blog on July 21, 2006. Further details were also announced by Chris Pirillo on his blog. Nothing further has been mentioned about a reunion of TechTV staff since 2006. Laporte and Patrick Norton, however, did team up for a final skit on the series finale of &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;.

<doc id="248322" wikidata="Q923724" url="?curid=248322" title="Sinecure">
<text>A sinecure ( or ; from the Latin , &#x27;without&#x27;, and , &#x27;care&#x27;) is a position with a salary or otherwise generating income that requires or involves little or no responsibility, labour, or active service. The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the &quot;cure [care] of souls&quot;, the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. Sinecures have historically provided a potent tool for governments or monarchs to distribute patronage, while recipients are able to store up titles and easy salaries.

A sinecure can also be given to an individual whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the Government House Leader in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so that they may become a member of the Cabinet. Similar examples are the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, whose holders are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Privy Council and therefore may be given admitted to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom (which is formally the executive committee of the Privy Council). The minister without portfolio is a frequent example of this sinecure, often employed to give cabinet-level positions to enough members of all partners in a coalition government. Other sinecures operate as legal fictions, such as the British office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, used as a legal excuse for resigning from Parliament.

==History==

&quot;Sinecure&quot;, properly a term of ecclesiastical law for a benefice without the cure of souls, arose in the English Church when the rector had no cure of souls nor resided in the parish, the work of the incumbent being performed by a vicar. Such sinecure rectories were expressly granted by the patron. They were abolished by Parliament under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840.

Other ecclesiastical sinecures were certain cathedral dignities to which no spiritual functions attached or incumbencies where by reason of depopulation and the like, the parishioners disappeared or the parish church was allowed to decay. Such cases eventually ceased to exist.

The term is also used of any office or place to which salary, emoluments, or dignity, but no duties, are attached. The British civil service and the royal household, for example, were loaded with innumerable offices which, by lapse of time, had become sinecures and were only kept as the reward of political services or to secure voting power in Parliament. They were prevalent in the 18th century, but were gradually abolished by statutes during that and the following centuries.

<doc id="248323" wikidata="Q1396477" url="?curid=248323" title="Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton">
<text>Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton (159628 September 1652) was an English politician, military officer and peer. During the First English Civil War, he served as Royalist commander in the West Country, and was made Baron Hopton of Stratton in 1643.

Along with his close friend Sir Edward Hyde (later the Earl of Clarendon), he was made advisor to the future Charles II, when he was appointed to rule the West in early 1644. He commanded the last significant Royalist field army, and followed Charles into exile after surrendering in March 1646. A devout supporter of the Church of England, his personal opposition to Catholicism and Presbyterianism meant he took no further part in the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He died in Bruges in 1652.

In his stated account of the war, Clarendon described him as &#x27;a man of great honour, integrity, and piety, of great courage and industry, and an excellent officer for any command but the supreme, to which he was not equal&#x27;.

==Life==
Ralph Hopton was born in early 1596, and baptised on 13 March at St Peter&#x27;s, in Evercreech. He was the eldest child of Robert Hopton, 1575 to 1638, and Jane ( Kemys, circa 1570 to 1610, who owned estates in Monmouthshire. His grandfather&#x27;s lands in Suffolk had been sold to provide dowries for his ten surviving daughters, and Robert inherited Witham Friary in Somerset, acquired from Glastonbury Abbey after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538.

He was educated at a local grammar school, possibly King&#x27;s School, Bruton; various sources confirm he attended Lincoln College, Oxford, as did his uncle, Sir Arthur Hopton. In 1614, he studied law at Middle Temple in London, thus completing the education common for a man of his standing at the time.

He married Elizabeth Capel (1596-1646) in 1623; their marriage was childless. His estates were inherited by his nephew Thomas Wyndham, son of his eldest sister Catherine.

==Career==
===1615 to 1642===

From 1615 to 1618, Hopton was travelling in Europe, in order to &#x27;learn languages&#x27;. In 1620, he joined an English volunteer force under Sir Horace Vere, sent to support Frederick of the Palatinate, newly appointed Protestant king of Bohemia. This was authorised by James I, whose daughter, Elizabeth, was Frederick&#x27;s wife; Hopton&#x27;s younger sister Abigail was one of her Maids of Honour.

After Frederick&#x27;s defeat at White Mountain in November 1620, he and his close friend William Waller were among those who escorted the Royal couple to safety, the Queen reportedly riding on his horse. They finally reached safety in the Dutch Republic in early 1621.

Hopton returned to London in February, and elected Member of Parliament, or MP, for Shaftesbury, a constituency controlled by the Earl of Pembroke, a connection of his mother, Jane. Parliament&#x27;s fury at James&#x27; lack of support for his sister, and the Protestant cause in general, found an outlet in charges against an elderly Catholic lawyer, Edward Floyd, accused of insulting Frederick. Despite his personal anti-Catholicism, Hopton argued Floyd should not be condemned without a proper hearing; he was ultimately released, after James intervened.

When Parliament adjourned in June, he enlisted in Sir Charles Rich&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, serving in the Palatinate campaign against the Catholic League. It appears likely he was among the English garrison of Frankenthal, which was ordered by James to surrender in March 1623.

Back in England, he married Elizabeth Capell, five years his senior, and widow of Justinian Lewin, a Privy Councillor; while childless, their marriage was apparently happy. Invited to stand as MP for Somerset in 1624, he declined, instead joining an English force recruited by Mansfeld to relieve Breda, then besieged by the Spanish. They arrived in the Dutch Republic in February 1625, reportedly in an &#x27;appalling state;&#x27; the expedition collapsed, Breda surrendered, and Hopton returned home in July.

In his absence, Hopton was appointed MP for Bath in place of Nicholas Hyde, who switched to Bristol; Hyde was the uncle of Edward Hyde, future Earl of Clarendon. Their connection links Hopton with the constitutional monarchists, those who opposed attempts by Charles I to rule without Parliament, but ultimately supported him in 1642.

During the 1625 to 1630 Anglo-Spanish War, Hopton refused to take part in the Cádiz expedition, accurately predicting its failure due to lack of funding. He was made a Knight of the Bath in February 1626, and MP for Wells in 1628. The following year, Charles dissolved Parliament, and did not recall it until 1640.

Appointed Deputy lieutenant of Somerset, and a Justice of the Peace, Hopton inherited his father&#x27;s estates in 1638. He avoided involvement in the political debates of the 1630s, but supported the levying of Ship money, and in 1639, raised a troop of cavalry to fight in the first of the 1639 and 1640 Bishops Wars. Charles refused to seek financing from Parliament, and the result was chaos; although he assembled 15,000 men at York, the vast majority were untrained, unfed, unpaid and mutinous conscripts from the Northern trained bands, armed with bows and arrows. He was obliged to agree the Treaty of Berwick, leaving the Covenanters in control of Scotland.

Seeking funds for another attempt, in early 1640 Charles called what became known as the Short Parliament; Hopton was selected for Somerset, but the house refused to provide taxes without concessions, and was dissolved after three weeks. Hopton took no part in the 1640 war, another humiliating defeat; he was MP for Wells in the Long Parliament, this time called to raise the money to pay the Scots to return large parts of Northern England.

Along with Edward Hyde and other moderates, he voted for the execution of Charles&#x27; chief advisor, the Earl of Strafford; unlike them, he also backed the strongly anti-Catholic Grand Remonstrance in late 1641. A committed supporter of the Church of England, the arrest of Archbishop Laud and exclusion of bishops from the Lords seems to have been the point when he changed sides. He defended the attempt to arrest the Five Members in January 1642, and in early March, was held in the Tower of London for two weeks for objecting to Parliament censuring the king.

===1642 to 1646===
After his release in March, Hopton was appointed Royalist Commissioner of Array for Somerset, placing him in command of the local trained bands. Despite Hopton&#x27;s connections, the county was dominated by Parliament, forcing him to withdraw to Sherborne, in Dorset; the First English Civil War began on 22 August, when Charles raised his standard at Nottingham.

Charles named the Marquess of Hertford as his Lieutenant General in the West. Threatened by a larger Parliamentary army under the Earl of Bedford, the Royalists retreated from Wells to Minehead, where Hopton advised Hertford to take the infantry and artillery across the water to South Wales.

Accompanied by a small force of cavalry, Hopton joined Sir Bevil Grenville and other supporters in Cornwall. Under his command, the Royalists won victories at Braddock Down in January 1643, then Stratton in May. After the inconclusive Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July, he linked up with Hertford and Prince Maurice; their combined force destroyed William Waller&#x27;s Western Association army at Roundway Down on 13 July. The biggest Royalist success of the war, it secured the West Country, apart from isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere.

Temporarily blinded by an explosion after Lansdowne, Hopton was confirmed as Royalist commander in the West, made Baron Hopton of Stratton, and governor of Bristol. In September, it was agreed Prince Rupert would move against London, while Hopton advanced into Hampshire and Sussex, whose iron foundries were Parliament&#x27;s main source of armaments. However, Rupert was checked at Newbury on 20 September, and although Hopton reached Winchester in November, he was prevented from moving further.

In March 1644, he was defeated at Cheriton, ending the Royalist campaign in Southern England, and damaging his position with Charles. Although he served in the Lostwithiel campaign, his main role became one of administration; in early 1645, he was appointed to the Council advising the future Charles II. After Naseby in June, the Western Army was the last significant Royalist field force, but was scattered by the New Model Army at Langport in July.

Hopton succeeded Lord Goring as commander in January 1646, but the remnants of his army were defeated at Torrington on 16 February 1646. He pulled back to Truro, where he surrendered to Thomas Fairfax on 12 March.

===1646 to 1652===

Along with Edward Hyde, he followed the Prince of Wales to Jersey; like the majority of his advisors, they refused to accompany him to Paris, concerned over the influence of his strongly Catholic mother, Henrietta Maria. His wife died shortly after, and in 1647, he moved to Rouen, where he stayed with his uncle, Sir Arthur Hopton, former Ambassador in Madrid.

He resumed his position as advisor to Charles II during the 1648 to 1649 Second English Civil War, which continued after the execution of Charles I in January 1649. He resigned after Charles II signed the 1650 Treaty of Breda, which agreed to impose Presbyterianism on England in return for Scottish support in restoring him to the throne. An Episcopalian Church of England was central to Hopton&#x27;s political beliefs, and he refused to support it.

While in exile, he wrote &quot;Bellum civile&quot;, an account of his campaign in the West from 1642 to 1644. He died at Bruges in September 1652, and after the 1660 Restoration, his body was reburied at St Mary&#x27;s, in Witham Friary in Somerset. Confiscated by Parliament in 1647, his estates were returned to his family, and inherited by his nephew Thomas Wyndham.

<text>Clifford Benjamin Brown (October 30, 1930 – June 26, 1956) was an American jazz trumpeter, pianist and composer. He died at the age of 25 in a car crash, leaving behind four years&#x27; worth of recordings. His compositions &quot;Sandu&quot;, &quot;Joy Spring&quot;, and &quot;Daahoud&quot; have become jazz standards. Brown won the &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine Critics&#x27; Poll for New Star of the Year in 1954; he was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Early career==
Brown was born into a musical family in Wilmington, Delaware. His father organized his four sons, including Clifford, into a vocal quartet. Around age ten, Brown started playing trumpet at school after becoming fascinated with the shiny trumpet his father owned. At age thirteen, his father bought him a trumpet and provided him with private lessons. In high school, Brown received lessons from Robert Boysie Lowery and played in &quot;a jazz group that Lowery organized&quot;, making trips to Philadelphia.

His trips to Philadelphia grew in frequency after he graduated from high school. Brown briefly attended Delaware State University as a math major before he switched to Maryland State College. He played in the fourteen-piece, jazz-oriented Maryland State Band. In June 1950, he was injured in a car crash after a performance. While in the hospital, he was visited by Dizzy Gillespie, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music. For a time, injuries restricted him to playing the piano.

Brown was influenced and encouraged by Fats Navarro. His first recordings were with R&amp;B bandleader Chris Powell. He worked with Art Blakey, Tadd Dameron, Lionel Hampton and J. J. Johnson, before forming a band with Max Roach.

One of the most notable developments during Brown&#x27;s period in New York was the formation of Art Blakey&#x27;s Quintet, which would become the Jazz Messengers. Blakey formed the band with Brown, Lou Donaldson, Horace Silver, and Curley Russell, and recorded the quintet&#x27;s first album live at the Birdland jazz club. During one of the rehearsal sessions, fellow trumpeter Miles Davis listened and joked about Clifford Brown&#x27;s technical ability to play the trumpet. The live recording session ultimately spanned two days with multiple takes needed on only a couple of the tunes.

A week at Club Harlem in May 1952 featured alto saxophonist Charlie Parker and Brown. Brown later noted that Parker was impressed by his playing, saying privately to the young trumpeter &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

Just before the formation of the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet, journalist Nat Hentoff and Brown interviewed for a &quot;DownBeat&quot; article titled &quot;Clifford Brown – the New Dizzy&quot;.

== Later career ==
Roach&#x27;s stature had grown as he recorded with a host of other emerging artists (including Bud Powell, Sonny Stitt, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk) and co-founded Debut, one of the first artist-owned labels, with Charles Mingus. Having participated in the legendary Jazz at Massey Hall concert of 1953, the drummer had relocated to the Los Angeles area and had replaced Shelly Manne in the popular Lighthouse All Stars. Roach and Brown formed the joint Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet in the mid-1950s with tenor saxophonist Harold Land, pianist Richie Powell, and bassist George Morrow, with tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins taking Land&#x27;s place in 1955. Brown was in the L.A. area from March to August 1954, on the invitation of Roach, who arrived on the West Coast with other well-regarded jazz musicians including Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. Prior to their first outing, the 1954 Pasadena Auditorium Concert, Roach included Brown on the basis that the two would be co-leaders.

The band started when Brown and Roach rented a studio in California. With Brown able to play piano and drums in addition to trumpet, the co-leaders could experiment extensively with these instruments in the studio. They settled on the standard bebop quintet of trumpet, saxophone, piano, bass, and drums, with sax, piano, and bass players needed. When first choice tenor player Sonny Stitt chose his own musical direction, the bandleaders settled on sax player Teddy Edwards, former Count Basie bassist George Morrow, and unconventional pianist Carl Perkins. Though the lineup was short-lived, the group &quot;sent shock waves throughout the jazz community,&quot; according to Sam Samuelson.

As the band was still deciding on its personnel, Brown and Roach met alto player and multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy, who had his own apartment where he hosted jam sessions. Among the jam sessions&#x27; musicians were future quintet members Harold Land and George Morrow. Bud Powell&#x27;s brother Richie arrived in the L.A. area around this time and was recruited as the quintet&#x27;s pianist. The band accepted recording session offers and Brown composed several tunes that were adopted by the new quintet. Meanwhile, a larger, fully arranged band was organized for one of the upcoming recording sessions by Jack Montrose of Pacific Coast Jazz Records. The session &quot;embrace[d] West Coast cool&quot; with &quot;immaculately performed charts,&quot; according to reviewer Gordon Jack of &quot;Jazz Journal&quot;.

An early session of the Brown/Roach Quintet, &quot;Clifford Brown &amp; Max Roach,&quot; featured the new lineup performing several of Brown&#x27;s latest compositions. Samuelson referred to the album as a &quot;nice gamut between boplicity and pleasant balladry.&quot; Other albums featuring the Brown/Roach collaboration included &quot;Brown and Roach, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Study in Brown&quot;.

Brown also recorded albums outside the quintet including the Pacific Coast Jazz session and two albums with jazz vocalist Dinah Washington. Both were recorded from a jam session setting and featured other jazz trumpeters including Maynard Ferguson and Clark Terry. Following the Dinah Washington recordings, Brown slowed the pace of his recordings and returned to the East Coast, recording an album with Sarah Vaughan in December 1954.

The experiments in bop continued in the 1955 session &quot;Study in Brown&quot;, such as use of instrument sounds to mimic an inner city environment in &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; and &quot;international flavor&quot; in &quot;George&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;. Jazz critic Scott Yanow referred to the album as &quot;premiere early hard bop&quot; and noted the quintet&#x27;s &quot;unlimited potential.&quot;

A 1955 live performance by Brown with Billy Root and Ziggy Vines (sometimes mistakenly thought to have been recorded just before Brown&#x27;s death a year later) was released on tape in 1973. Following this session, with Blakey temporarily replacing Roach following a car accident, the group toured, visiting Chicago and then Rhode Island for the Newport Jazz Festival. Roach returned for this performance and jam session at Newport.

Released in 1956, &quot;At Basin Street&quot; – the quintet&#x27;s final &quot;official album&quot; – introduced Rollins. The album was called a &quot;hard bop classic&quot; and &quot;highly recommended&quot; by Scott Yanow. While previous quintet albums included original compositions, this one consisted mainly of jazz standards, although it did include a couple of Richie Powell compositions.

== Personal life ==
In June 1954, Brown married Emma LaRue Anderson (1933–2005), whom he called &quot;Joy Spring&quot;. The two had been introduced by Max Roach. Clifford and LaRue celebrated their marriage vows three times, partly because their families were on opposite coasts and partly because of their different religious denominations – Brown was Methodist and Anderson was Catholic. They were first married in a private ceremony June 26, 1954, in Los Angeles (on Anderson&#x27;s st birthday). They again celebrated their marriage in a religious setting on July 16, 1954, with the certificate being registered in Los Angeles County. A reception was held at the Tiffany Club where the Art Pepper/Jack Montrose Quintet had been replaced, a few days earlier, by the Red Norvo Trio with Tal Farlow and Red Mitchell. Anderson&#x27;s parish priest followed them to Boston where, on August 1, 1954, they performed their marriage ceremony at Saint Richards Church in the Roxbury neighborhood.

Brown stayed away from drugs and was not fond of alcohol. Rollins, who was recovering from heroin addiction, said that &quot;Clifford was a profound influence on my personal life. He showed me that it was possible to live a good, clean life and still be a good jazz musician.&quot; Brown&#x27;s enthusiasm for practicing the trumpet was noted by Lou Donaldson, who said Clifford would &quot;do lip exercises and mouth exercises all day.&quot;

==Death==
In June 1956, Brown and Richie Powell embarked on a drive to Chicago for their next appearance. Powell&#x27;s wife Nancy was at the wheel so Clifford and Richie could sleep. While driving at night in the rain on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, she presumably lost control of the car which went off the road west of Bedford, killing all three in the resulting crash. Brown is buried in Mt. Zion Cemetery, in Wilmington, Delaware.

== Legacy ==

Jazz historian Ira Gitler said of Brown, &quot;l&#x27;m sorry I never got to know him better. Not that it necessarily follows that one who plays that beautifully is also a marvelous person, but I think one can discern in Clifford Brown&#x27;s case that the particular kind of extraordinary playing was linked to an equally special human being ... Photographs of Clifford Brown reveal some of that inner self; the shots in which he is depicted in a playing attitude show his intensity, that utter concentration and total connection with his instrument.&quot;

In the 1990s, video from the TV program &quot;Soupy&#x27;s On&quot; (starring comedian Soupy Sales, who was a big jazz fan and booked several top musical stars for his show) was discovered of Clifford Brown playing two tunes. This is the only video recording known to exist of Brown.

Brown&#x27;s nephew, drummer Rayford Griffin &quot;(né&quot; Rayford Galen Griffin; b. 1958), modernized Brown&#x27;s music on his 2015 album &quot;Reflections of Brownie.&quot; Brown&#x27;s grandson, Clifford Benjamin Brown III (b. 1982), plays trumpet on one of the tracks, &quot;Sandu&quot;.

Benny Golson composed &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot; in 1957 as a tribute to Brown, and Jon Hendricks added lyrics. Dizzy Gillespie, Art Farmer, Bud Powell, Art Blakey, and Golson himself used the song to pay tribute throughout subsequent years. Arturo Sandoval dedicated an album, &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot;, to Brown in 1992.

<text>Aztalan State Park is a Wisconsin state park in the town of Aztalan, Jefferson County. Established in 1952, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The park covers along the Crawfish River.
Aztalan is the site of an ancient Mississippian culture settlement that flourished during the 10th to 13th centuries. The indigenous people constructed massive earthwork mounds for religious and political purposes. They were part of a widespread culture with important settlements throughout the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. Their trading network extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, and into the Southeast of the present-day United States.

==Pre-history (900–1300)==
Aztalan was first settled around 900 CE by a Native American culture known as the Middle Mississippian tradition. The chief center of a Middle Mississippian settlement is at Cahokia, in present-day Illinois, a city that at its peak had 20,000–30,000 people. This was not surpassed by Europeans in North America until after 1800. These settlements are characterized by the construction of earthwork mounds, stockades, and houses, by decorated Mississippian culture pottery, and agricultural practices. There are also elements of the Woodland culture found there.

The residents of Aztalan had long-distance trading relationships with other settlements, linked by their use of the rivers for transportation. For example, items found at the settlement include copper from Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, seashells from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and stone such as Mill Creek chert from other areas of the Midwest.

Sometime between 1200 and 1300 CE, the Aztalan settlement was abandoned. Archeologists and historians surmise they may have outgrown environmental resources, or encountered more warfare from other cultures, but do not know for sure. The Little Ice Age occurred soon after 1300 and may have contributed to farming difficulties, putting too much stress on the local chiefdoms.

===Life in Aztalan===
Most of the residents lived in circular or rectangular houses which they built between the river and the eastern secondary wall. The placement of the structures suggests that the layout was planned. The dwellings were built around a central ceremonial plaza likely used for rituals and public gatherings, as has been found at similar locations. Posts for the house frames were placed either in individual holes, or in a trench dug slightly narrower than the posts. The walls were completed with wattle and daub, a plaster mixture of grass and clay. The roof was covered with bark or thatch. The doorway usually faced south to keep out the winter&#x27;s north winds. Inside, a single family slept on pole-frame beds, covered with tamarack boughs, deer skins, and furs. Sometimes a fire was kept in the middle of the house and a hole in the roof let out the smoke. Storage pits dug in the earthen floor of the house held foods such as corn, nuts, and seeds in woven bags. Perishable foods such as meat were most likely stored outside prior to cooking. Refuse pits for garbage and community storage pits were located outside.

The site was well chosen to provide a variety of food sources, and other resources. The staple of the diet was cultivated corn (maize), and other plants were also gathered as food, such as acorns, hickory nuts, and berries. Tobacco was grown at this time for sacred rituals, as tobacco seeds have been found at this site. The main source of meat was deer, especially in the winter. The people also caught and ate beaver, elk, fox, muskrats, and raccoons. They hunted birds and turtles, collected mussels, and caught fish in the Crawfish River directly next to the site. To help with fishing, the people set up rock barriers called fish weirs at key points, one of which is visible when the river is low. They caught catfish, bass, suckers, buffalo fish, pike, drum fish, and gar. They disposed of the thousands of shells from consumed mussels in middens. These have layers of shells several feet thick.

The people living here gathered food and resources for tools and building. Other materials were obtained through trade. Trees nearby provided wood for posts for house walls and stockades, bows and arrow shafts, and firewood. Smaller tree branches and grass were used for bedding and roofs. Shells were used to make jewelry, beads, spoons, and digging tools. The people dug river clay to use in fashioning fired pottery. Traded items, used for ornamental or ceremonial purposes, were an attribute of status because of their rarity.


===Physical features===

The most obvious features of Aztalan are its pyramid-shaped, flat-topped platform mounds and the stockades, believed to have served both ceremonial and defensive functions.

====Mounds====
Three platform mounds remain on the site. The largest is the one in the southwest corner of the stockade; one almost as large is located in the northwest corner. The smallest of the three is along the east side of the settlement, near the Crawfish River (labeled &quot;West Branch of Rock River&quot; on the plates). The hill in the southeast corner is a natural gravel knoll, not built by the inhabitants.

The largest mound was built in three stages, with a set of steps leading to the top, where a structure was built over the entire flat top. The mound was covered with a clay cap, probably to enhance its appearance. Corn was stored in pits inside the structure. Scholars have several theories about why the corn was kept there, and the overall purpose of the structure. It may have been the storage facility for the entire village, or storage for food just for the top village officials; it may have been used for ceremonies and rituals; or it could have been a house for the village officials. This topmost structure was rebuilt each time a larger stage of the mound was built on top of the old.

The northwestern mound, used for formal burial, was also built in three stages. A special structure, approximately , with its long axis towards the northeast–southwest, was built on the west side of the mound. Its doorway was in its southwest corner, and the structure was covered with a mixture of clay, willow branches, and grass. The floor was covered with a mat of what may have been cattails. The bodies of ten people were placed side by side on this, with their heads toward the doorway. The bones of another person were bundled together with cord and placed near them. Once this construction was complete, and the bodies were inside, the building was burned.

The eastern mound had a large open-walled structure, about , built on top of it, with firepits lined with white sand inside. The function of this mound and structure remain unclear.

Additionally, to the northwest of the stockaded area, a row of round mounds extends northward. When archaeologists excavated in these mounds during the 1920s, they did not find the burial sites they had expected. Instead, each mound had a large post set in a pit in its center, surrounded by gravel and soil, with the pit capped with clay and gravel to hold the post steady. These mounds have been termed &quot;marker mounds&quot; because they may have been used to mark the site for travelers, but this is not certain. They may also have been used for announcements, message relays, or for calculations of astronomical phenomena, as has been found at other Mississippian sites, such as Cahokia.

====Stockade====

The settlement was surrounded on the north, west, and south sides by a palisade, a wall of logs set vertically into the ground. Narrow holes were dug into the ground, then the posts were lifted into position and set into the holes. The stockade was finished by people weaving flexible willow branches through the posts, and plastering the whole with a mixture of clay and grass to fill in the gaps, a technique similar to wattle and daub.

At some point, a smaller stockade was built within the outer one to delimit the dwelling areas. Archeologists have not been able to determine whether both stockades existed simultaneously, for a layered defense, or one was built after the other fell into disuse.

In 1850, Increase A. Lapham, an author, scientist, and naturalist, surveyed the site on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, which was surveying ancient mounds. He described the outer stockade as being &quot; long at the north end, long on the west side and on the south side; making a total length of wall of . The ridge or wall is about , and from to ) in height&quot;. It had at least 33 square bastions at regular intervals along its length, similar in form and placement to some European fortifications, to allow defensive warriors to cover that area by shooting arrows. In addition, others were built along the secondary walls. Rather than having a gate to protect the entrance, the builders constructed the entrance so that it was camouflaged from direct view and blended in with the wall on either side.

During the time Aztalan was inhabited, two sets of outer stockades were built. The posts of the first one eventually rotted, and the second one burned and was never rebuilt. It is not clear whether the purpose of the stockade was to keep out invaders, or if the occupants built it for another reason.

==Modern discovery (1835–1919)==
A young man named Timothy Johnson discovered the ruins of the ancient settlement in December 1835. In January 1836, N. F. Hyer conducted the first rough survey of the site, and published his discovery in the &quot;Milwaukie Advertiser&quot; of January 1837.

According to Lapham:
The name Aztalan was given to this place by Mr. Hyer, because, according to Humboldt, the Aztecs, or ancient inhabitants of Mexico, had a tradition that their ancestors came from a country at the north, which they called Aztalan; and the possibility that these may have been remains of their occupancy, suggested the idea of restoring the name. It is made up of two Mexican words, &quot;atl&quot;, water, and &quot;an&quot;, near; and the country was probably so named from its proximity to large bodies of water. Hence the natural inference that the country about these great lakes was the ancient residence of the Aztecs.

Hyer wrote, &quot;We are determined to preserve these ruins from being ruined.&quot; However, in 1838, President Martin Van Buren refused a request by Massachusetts statesman Edward Everett to withdraw the site from public sale, and it was sold for $22. In the following years, the surface was plowed, the mounds were leveled for easier farming, pottery shards and &quot;Aztalan brick&quot; were hauled away by the wagonload to fill in potholes in township roads, and souvenir hunters took numerous artifacts.

In 1850, Lapham urged the preservation of the stockade. At the time, the stockade was still standing, though not in the condition it had once been.

==State park foundation and reconstruction (1919–present)==

In 1919, archeological excavations began at Aztalan under the direction of Dr. S. A. Barrett.
In 1920, the Landmarks Committee of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, under Publius V. Lawson, started a new effort to save what remained of Aztalan, supported by the Friends of Our Native Landscape and the Wisconsin Archeological Society. They made their first purchase of some of the land in 1921, ) west of the stockade and containing eight conical mounds, and presented it to the Wisconsin Archeological Society.

Work for preservation continued. In 1936, the state&#x27;s archeological and historical societies petitioned the federal government for funds to reconstruct the stockade, without success, although during the Great Depression the US funded archeological work and preservation at numerous ancient sites around the country. In 1941, the newly founded Lake Mills-Aztalan Historical Society began an energetic campaign to preserve the stockade area.

In 1945, the Wisconsin State Assembly passed a bill directing the State Planning Board to study the possibility of establishing a state park at Aztalan. In 1947, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed a resolution requesting the State Conservation Commission to purchase Aztalan. were purchased to this end in 1948, and the Wisconsin Archeological Society and the Lake Mills-Aztalan Historical Society donated their holdings. Aztalan opened to the public in 1952 as Aztalan State Park.

Aztalan was designated a registered National Historic Landmark in 1964 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 1968, the state reconstructed portions of the stockade wall by placing new posts in the original holes. A section of this was also covered with the wattle and daub, but this has since worn away or been removed.

<text>Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov (; – 21 February 1984) was a Russian novelist and winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature. He is known for writing about life and fate of Don Cossacks during the Russian Revolution, the civil war and the period of collectivization, primarily in his most famous novel, &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;.

==Life and work==

Sholokhov was born in the Russian Empire, in the &quot;land of the Cossacks&quot; – the Kruzhilin hamlet, part of stanitsa Vyoshenskaya, in the former Administrative Region of the Don Cossack Host. His father, a Russian, Aleksander Mikhailovich Sholokhov (1865–1925), was a member of the lower middle class, at various times a farmer, a cattle trader, and a miller. Sholokhov&#x27;s mother, Anastasia Danilovna Chernikova (1871–1942), the widow of a Cossack, came from Ukrainian peasant stock (her father was a peasant in the Chernihiv oblast). She did not become literate until a time in her life when she wanted to correspond with her son. His family were not Don Cossacks, but &quot;inogorodnye&quot; (&quot;outlanders&quot;), the rather disparaging term used by the Don Cossacks for outsiders who settled in their territory by the banks of the Don. The &quot;inogorodnye&quot; tended to be much poorer than the Don Cossacks and were excluded from voting for officials in the Host government (the Don Cossack Host were allowed to elect their leaders, except for the &quot;ataman&quot; who headed the Host, who was always appointed by the Emperor).

Sholokhov attended schools in , Moscow, Boguchar, and Veshenskaya until 1918, when he joined the Bolshevik side in the Russian Civil War at the age of 13. He spent the next few years fighting. During the Russian Civil War, the &quot;inogorodnye&quot; tended to support the Reds while the Don Cossacks tended to support the Whites.

Sholokhov began writing at 17. He completed his first literary work, the short story &quot;The Birthmark&quot;, at 19. In 1922 Sholokhov moved to Moscow to become a journalist, but had to support himself through manual labour. He was a stevedore, a stonemason, and an accountant from 1922 to 1924, but he also intermittently participated in writers&#x27; &quot;seminars&quot;. His first published work was a satirical article, &quot;The Test&quot; (19 October 1923). In 1924 Sholokhov returned to Veshenskaya and devoted himself entirely to writing. In the same year he married Maria Petrovna Gromoslavskaia (1901–1992), the daughter of Pyotr Gromoslavsky, the &quot;ataman&quot; of Bukanovskaya village. They had two daughters and two sons.

Sholokhov&#x27;s first book was &quot;Tales from the Don&quot;, a collection of stories largely based on his personal experiences in his native region during World War I and the Russian Civil War; it was published in 1926. The story &quot;Nakhalyonok&quot;, partly based on his own childhood, was later made into a popular film.

In the same year, Sholokhov began writing &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;, which took him fourteen years to complete (1926–1940). It became the most-read work of Soviet historical fiction, and it earned him the 1941 State Stalin Prize. It deals with the experiences of the Cossacks before and during World War I and the Russian Civil War.

Another novel, &quot;Virgin Soil Upturned&quot;, which earned a Lenin Prize, took 28 years to complete. It is composed of two parts, &quot;Seeds of Tomorrow&quot; (1932) and &quot;Harvest on the Don&quot; (1960), and reflects life during collectivization in the Don area. It was heralded as a powerful example of socialist realism. &quot;Virgin Soil Upturned&quot; was translated and widely read in China, where it influenced China&#x27;s socialist literature.

The short story &quot;The Fate of a Man&quot; (1957) was made into a popular Russian film. During World War II, Sholokhov wrote about the Soviet war effort for various journals. He also covered the devastation caused by Wehrmacht troops along the Don. His mother was killed when Veshenskaya was bombed in 1942.

Sholokhov&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;They Fought for Their Country&quot; is about World War II (known in the Soviet Union, and now in Russia, as the Great Patriotic War). The book is the source for a 1975 film.

Sholokhov&#x27;s collected works were published in eight volumes between 1956 and 1960, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1965.

==Authorship of texts==
First rumors of Sholokhov&#x27;s supposed plagiarism appeared in 1928 following the success of the first two volumes of &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;: it was speculated that the author stole the manuscript from a dead White Army officer. Sholokhov asked the &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper to prove his authorship, submitting his manuscripts of the first three volumes of &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; and the plan of the fourth one. In 1929 a special commission was formed that accepted Sholokhov&#x27;s authorship. In the conclusion signed by four experts, the commission stated that there was no evidence of plagiarism on the one hand, and on the other hand the manuscripts&#x27; style was close to that of Sholokhov&#x27;s previous book, &quot;Tales from the Don&quot;.

The allegations resurfaced in the 1960s with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as a notable proponent, possibly in retaliation for Sholokhov&#x27;s scathing opinion of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s novella &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;. Several other writers have been proposed as the &#x27;original&#x27; author, although Fyodor Kryukov, a Cossack and Anti-Bolshevik who had died in 1920 has emerged as the leading candidate.

In 1984 Norwegian Slavicist and mathematician Geir Kjetsaa, in a monograph written with three other colleagues, provided statistical analyses of sentence lengths showing that Mikhail Sholokhov was likely the true author of &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;.

The debate focused on the published book, because Sholokhov&#x27;s archive was destroyed in a bomb raid during the Second World War and no manuscript material or drafts were known. 143 pages of the manuscript of the 3rd &amp; 4th books were later found and returned to Sholokhov; since 1975, they have been held by the Pushkin House in St Petersburg. Then, in 1987, several hundred pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered, including chapters excluded from the final draft. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov&#x27;s own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife, Maria, and sisters. Sholokhov had had his friend Vassily Kudashov look after it, and after he was killed at war his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed it. The manuscript was finally obtained by the Institute of World Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1999 with assistance from the Russian government.

In 1999 the Russian Academy of Science carried out an analysis of the manuscript and came to the conclusion that &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; had been written by Sholokhov himself. A lengthy analysis by Felix Kuznetsov of the creative process visible in the papers provides detailed support for Sholokhov&#x27;s authorship.

During the 2000s a Russian-Israeli linguist Zeev Bar-Sella once again stated that Sholokhov was not the true author of &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; as well as the other works attributed to him. Based on his own textual analysis of the novel he asserts that the manuscripts were written by Sholokhov not earlier than 1929 and names the writer Viktor Sevsky (real name Veniamin Krasnushkin) as the true author.

==Political and social activity==

Sholokhov met Joseph Stalin in 1930, and subsequently was one of very few people who dared to give the dictator a truthful account of what was happening in the country and nonetheless was not punished. In the 1930s, he wrote several letters to Stalin from his home in Veshenskaya about the appalling conditions in the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; and &quot;sovkhozes&quot; along the Don, requesting assistance for the farmers. In January 1931, he warned: &quot;Comrade Stalin, without exaggeration, conditions are catastrophic!&quot; On 4 April 1933, he sent a long letter in which, among many other details, he named two OGPU officers whom he accused of torturing prisoners from his district. Stalin reacted by sending a senior official, Matvei Shkiryatov, to investigate. The two officers were arrested and sentenced to death; their sentences were later revoked, but they were banned from working in Sholokhov&#x27;s home village. Stalin also arranged for extra food to be sent to Veshenskaya and the neighbouring district.

Sholokhov joined the CPSU in 1932, and in 1937 he was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In August 1937, his best friend, the secretary of the Veshenskaya party committee, P.K. Lugovoi, was arrested. Sholokohov was due to take part in an international writers&#x27; conference, but he refused to leave the country while Lugovoi was being held. Stalin sent another official, Vladimir Stavsky, to investigate, and invited Sholokhov to visit him in the Kremlin. After their meeting, on 4 November 1937, Lugovoi and two other prisoners on whose behalf Sholokhov had interceded were released, but in a subsequent letter to Stalin, he complained that the people responsible for wrongfully arresting them had not been punished.

On a visit to Moscow in 1938, Sholokhov met Yevgenia Yezhova, wife of Nikolai Yezhov, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs (NKVD), and checked into a hotel room with her, unaware that the room was bugged. Yezhov heard the recording and attacked Yezhova. On 23 October 1938, Sholokhov met Stalin in the Kremlin to complain that he had been put under surveillance in Veshenskaya, but when Yezhov was summoned to explain, he claimed not to know why. They met again on 31 October: this time the officer who had been investigating Sholokhov was also summoned. He said his orders had come from Moscow, but Yezhov again denied giving the order. Sholokhov claimed that he completed the fourth and last volume of &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; and its sequel on 21 December 1939, the day when the USSR was celebrating what was supposedly Stalin&#x27;s 60th birthday, and celebrated by opening a bottle of wine that Stalin had given him. He then wrote to Stalin to say how he had marked the special day.

In 1959 he accompanied Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on a trip to Europe and the United States. He became a member of the CPSU Central Committee in 1961, Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1939, and was a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet. He was twice awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and later became vice president of the Union of Soviet Writers.

He commented on the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial at the 23rd Congress by saying that the prison terms meted out to Sinyavsky and Daniel had been much too lenient compared to the &quot;revolutionary understanding of what is right&quot; during the 1920s, which turned part of the Soviet intelligentsia against him and resulted in two open letters by Lydia Chukovskaya and Yuri Galanskov addressed to Sholokhov.

==Late years==
Sholokhov almost stopped writing after 1969 and spent the late years at the Vyoshenskaya stanitsa. He used his Order of Lenin money to build a local school and his Nobel Prize to take the family on a road trip over Europe and Japan. In 1972 he became a vocal critic of Alexander Yakovlev, then a head of the Central Committee Propaganda Department, and his article &quot;Against Antihistoricism&quot; which attacked Russian nationalism; this resulted in a Politburo meeting and removal of Yakovlev from his position (he was then sent as an ambassador to Canada).

Mikhail Sholokhov died on 21 February 1984, from laryngeal cancer. He was buried in the grounds of his house at the Vyoshenskaya stanitsa along with his wife Maria Petrovna Sholokhova (nee Gromoslavskaya, 1902—1992).

<doc id="248334" wikidata="Q864688" url="?curid=248334" title="Yarmouth, Nova Scotia">
<text>Yarmouth is a port town located on the Bay of Fundy in southwestern Nova Scotia, Canada. Yarmouth is the shire town of Yarmouth County and is the largest population centre in the region.

==History==
Originally inhabited by the Mi&#x27;kmaq, the region was known as &quot;Keespongwitk&quot; meaning &quot;Lands End&quot; due to its position at the tip of the Nova Scotia peninsula.

===European settlement===
The region was visited in 1604 by Samuel de Champlain, who named it &quot;Cap-Fourchu&quot;, meaning &quot;forked or cloven cape.&quot; The first Europeans to make a settlement on these shores were the French Acadians. They set up a small fishing settlement known as &quot;Tebouque&quot; in the mid-1600s and by 1750 the population was 50 people. During the Seven Years&#x27; War the New England Planters settled at what is now the town of Yarmouth in 1759; the grantees were from Yarmouth, Massachusetts and they requested that Yarmouth be named after their former home. Yarmouth was founded on June 9, 1761, when a ship carrying three families arrived from Sandwich, Massachusetts. The ship carried the families of Sealed Landers, Ebenezer Ellis, and Moses Perry. During the American Revolution, some in Yarmouth were sympathetic to the rebellion. Following the war, Acadians originally from the Grand-Pré district who returned from exile in 1767 settled in the Yarmouth area.

=== American Revolution ===
There were a number of inhabitants of Yarmouth who supported the American rebels. Despite the American privateer raids in the Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (1775), the inhabitants still sheltered American prisoners after the Battle off Yarmouth (1777).

After the American Revolution, substantial numbers of United Empire Loyalists arrived in 1785.

===Shipbuilding===
Through the 19th century, the town was a major shipbuilding centre, at one point boasting more registered tonnage per capita than any other port in the world. From 1874 to 1885, Yarmouth was the second largest port of registry in Canada following Saint John, New Brunswick. In 1878, Yarmouth&#x27;s tonnage peaked at 453 vessels aggregating 166,623 tons, and in 1879, the town had the second largest registered tonnage in Canada.

Yarmouth ships were found in most major ports throughout the world at this time, including ships noted for courageous crews such as the ship &quot;Research&quot; in 1861 and ships noted for great size such as the ship &quot;County of Yarmouth&quot; in 1884, one of the largest wooden hull ships ever built in Canada. John Patch, the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern screw propeller driven ships in 1832 (4 years before John Ericsson&#x27;s patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a patent application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849 which drew praise in American scientific circles. However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller. Patch never received money or recognition and died a poor man at Yarmouth in 1861.

The town of Yarmouth was incorporated on August 6, 1890.

===Railways===
As wooden shipbuilding declined in the late 19th century, Yarmouth&#x27;s shipowners re-invested their capital into factories, iron-hulled steamships, and railways. The town&#x27;s first railway was the locally owned Western Counties Railway which was built from Yarmouth to Digby in the 1870s. It eventually was merged into the Dominion Atlantic Railway (DAR), with a network extending into the Annapolis Valley, Halifax and Truro; the DAR later became a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Halifax and South Western Railway was built along the south shore linking Yarmouth with Shelburne, Liverpool, Bridgewater and Halifax in the early 20th century; the H&amp;SW was eventually merged into the Canadian National Railway (CNR). While iron-hulled steamships had led to the decline of Yarmouth&#x27;s once-thriving wooden shipbuilding industry, they also made the port a vital connection between Nova Scotia&#x27;s rail lines and steamships destined for Boston and New York. Rail services were abandoned to Yarmouth in stages, beginning in 1982 (CNR) and ending in 1990 (CPR).

===Steamships and ferries===
Tourism has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when Loran Ellis Baker founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia. Baker&#x27;s steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston until 1900, when the company was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway. The DAR and Halifax and South Western Railway offered connections for passengers arriving in Yarmouth with steamship services operating to New York City and Boston.

In 1939, examiners at Yarmouth&#x27;s Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master&#x27;s papers to Molly Kool, the first female ship captain in the Western World.

Steamship connections between Yarmouth and Boston / New York were maintained by Eastern Steamship Lines but were suspended with the start of World War II; the SS &quot;Yarmouth Castle&quot; was one of many vessels which served this route. The service resumed a few years after the war with the S.S. Yarmouth, under the same company. This service continued into the mid 1950s and was then replaced with the M.V. Bluenose.

====CNR, CN Marine and Marine Atlantic====
Following the war, as the economy of western Nova Scotia improved, the need for a year-round daily service was made evident. The service was needed as a more timely route for transport of goods between markets in Nova Scotia and the United States. Demand increased for passenger traffic as well. This led citizens of southwestern Nova Scotia to undertake an extensive lobbying effort with the federal government to establish a ferry service in the Gulf of Maine connecting Yarmouth with a port in New England. In 1949 the Canadian Maritime Commission began to study the possibility of a ferry service connecting with a port in the US. After some controversy as to whether to return to the traditional Boston or New York service, a decision was made to focus the effort on a service from Yarmouth to Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1954, the federal government contracted Davie Shipbuilding to construct MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; which was launched in 1955 and began service in 1956 under the management of Canadian National Railway (CNR) and later (1977-1982) under the management of a federal Crown corporation named CN Marine.

In 1978 CN Marine started operating MV Marine Evangeline on a service from Yarmouth to Portland, Maine. In 1982 the old &quot;Bluenose&quot; was retired from the Bar Harbor service and sold. CN Marine replaced her with a newer vessel MV Stena Jutlandica which was renamed MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; to prevent confusion in tourism marketing literature.

In 1986, CN Marine was reorganized into the Crown corporation Marine Atlantic and in 1997, the federal government decided to end its financial support for the Gulf of Maine ferry service, soliciting proposals from private sector ferry companies to operate the route.

====Lion Ferry, Prince of Fundy Cruises, Scotia Prince Cruises====
The growth of post-war automobile-based tourism saw the provincial government encourage additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the Maritimes dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century. In 1970 the MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; service operated by CNR was joined by the MS &quot;Prince of Fundy&quot; on a route connecting Yarmouth with Portland, Maine operated by Lion Ferry. The service was supplemented between 1973 and 1976 by MS &quot;Bolero&quot;, however by 1976 both vessels were replaced by the MS &quot;Caribe&quot;. Lion Ferry sold Yarmouth&#x27;s second ferry service to Prince of Fundy Cruises who purchased MS &quot;Stena Olympica&quot; and renamed it MS &quot;Scotia Prince&quot;. The service underwent another ownership change in 2000 and was renamed Scotia Prince Cruises. In 2004 the company discovered toxic mould in its Portland terminal, owned by the City of Portland, cancelling its 2005 season. The City of Portland subsequently cancelled the company&#x27;s lease and evicted Scotia Prince Cruises, thus ending this ferry service.

====Bay Ferries====
In 1997 Bay Ferries, a subsidiary of Northumberland Ferries Limited, was the successful bidder for the federal government&#x27;s Gulf of Maine ferry service. Only the operating licence was transferred as well as the right to be the primary user of the federal government-owned ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor; the service would receive no subsidy from the federal government. Bay Ferries purchased MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; from Marine Atlantic and used that vessel for the remainder of the 1997 season before selling it.

In 1998, Bay Ferries introduced the first high speed catamaran passenger-vehicle ferry service in North America when it purchased HSC &quot;Incat 046&quot; from Incat in an aggressive bid to expand the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service. Throughout the 1990s the market for ferry services in southwestern Nova Scotia was threatened by significant expansions of 4-lane expressways in northern Nova Scotia and across southern New Brunswick so it was theorized that the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service could maintain market share if the ferry voyage time was shortened. Marketed as &quot;The Cat&quot;, the use of the ferry service grew largely due to Bay Ferries&#x27; investment and the novelty of riding the ultra-modern high speed catamaran. In 2002 Bay Ferries traded in HSC &quot;Incat 046&quot; for a larger vessel HSC &quot;The Cat&quot; which was also marketed as &quot;The Cat&quot;. Beginning in 2003, Bay Ferries began operating HSC &quot;The Cat&quot; during the winter months on services in the Caribbean.

Following the end of the service offered by Scotia Prince Cruises in 2004, Bay Ferries began operating HSC &quot;The Cat&quot; in 2006 between Yarmouth to Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor; the old Portland ferry terminal being replaced by the newly built Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal. Following a decline in American tourism to Nova Scotia, as well as record-high fuel prices, Bay Ferries sought subsidies from the federal and provincial governments for its Gulf of Maine ferry service. The federal government refused to provide a subsidy, having removed itself from operating such a service in 1997. However, the provincial government offered a subsidy to cover the operating loss and this was subsequently provided in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2009 the provincial government cancelled the subsidy and Bay Ferries announced in December 2009 that it was ending its ferry service and sold the vessel.

====Nova Star Cruises====
In 2013 the provincial government posted a request for proposals for re-establishing a Yarmouth - Maine ferry service, stating that a successful proponent would receive a $21 million subsidy over a 7-year period. In September 2013 it was announced that Nova Star Cruises was the successful proponent and in November 2013 it was confirmed that the service would start May 1, 2014, with the MV &quot;Nova Star&quot; offering daily round trips between Yarmouth and Portland. Nova Star Cruises also announced it was examining the possibility of using the vessel during the winter months on a service between Colombia and Panama, bypassing the Darién Gap. Nova Star&#x27;s contract to provide ferry services between Yarmouth and Portland was not renewed for 2016.

====Return of &quot;The Cat&quot;====
On March 24, 2016, Bay Ferries Limited announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year charter of HST-2. The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the Gulf of Maine between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth. The service and vessel will be branded as &quot;The CAT&quot; to align with the previous branding used by Bay Ferries. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in South Carolina and the service began on June 15, 2016.

===Second World War===
During the first year of the Second World War, Yarmouth was selected as the location for a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) facility. RCAF Station Yarmouth was originally opened in 1940 as three separate training sites (the East Camp, the West Camp and the Air Base).

The East Camp was home to a detachment of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s No. 34 Operational Training Unit (from RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge), who trained bomber crews, as well as the Royal Navy&#x27;s No. 1 Naval Air Gunners School who were located at Yarmouth from January 1, 1943, to March 30, 1945.

The West Camp was home to an Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Anti-Submarine Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and several Eastern Air Command Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, such as 162 Squadron.

The Air Base was home to the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery, various RCAF and RAF Bomber Squadrons and an Army Co-operation Reconnaissance Flight. Its primary function was as an administrative and logistical support base to the RAF and RCAF squadrons in the area, in addition to providing a Weather Information Section, an Armament Section and a firing range.

A Lockheed Hudson, a light bomber, from Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron 113 in Yarmouth became the first aircraft of the RCAF Eastern Air Command to destroy a submarine, sinking U-754 about south of Yarmouth on July 31, 1942. The sinking resulted in 43 casualties and no survivors.

Several smaller installations associated with RCAF Station Yarmouth were located in southwestern Nova Scotia, including a bombing range at Port Maitland, a fuel depot at Digby, and radar detachments at Plymouth, Tusket, Bear Point, Port Mouton and Rockville. In 1944, a detachment of the US Navy briefly came to Yarmouth to test the effectiveness of a blimp service. After a crash, the RCAF decided against this venture.

RCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the Department of Transport in 1946 and became the Yarmouth Airport. A Canadian Army training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street also provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.

==Culture==
The town is home to the Yarmouth County Museum &amp; Archives, which preserves the history of the town and surrounding county and operates the Killam Brothers building on the waterfront. The Firefighters Museum of Nova Scotia, part of the Nova Scotia Museum system is located on Main Street. The privately run Sweeney Fisheries Museum is also located in Yarmouth.

The Izaak Walton Killam Memorial house, founded in 1963, serves as the town&#x27;s public library. It is the largest branch of Western Counties Regional Library and houses the regional library&#x27;s headquarters.

The Yarmouth Arts Regional Council was established in 1974, under the leadership of Lydia Davison, a local music teacher. Over the next five years, with the assistance of the Canada Council and many volunteers, the Yarmouth Arts Regional Centre (Th&#x27;YARC) was constructed on the site of a former garage on Parade Street. Th&#x27;YARC continues to operate to this day, with the 350-seat Lydia Davison Theatre, an art gallery and a print-making shop.

A popular but unsupported cultural belief in Yarmouth holds that the American composer Meredith Willson wrote his well-known song &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot; while staying in Yarmouth&#x27;s Grand Hotel.

In August 2004, a record mako shark was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble. It weighed and set a new Canadian record. It is considered one of the largest mako sharks ever caught.

Seafest is an annual 7 day festival organized since 1979.

==Buildings and structures==
Yarmouth is known for some of the most exuberant examples of Victorian houses in the Maritimes, a legacy of the wealthy captains and shipowners of the town&#x27;s seafaring Golden Age. A heritage district preserves several blocks of these residences, including the Lovitt House and Eakin/Hatfield House. On the waterfront, two historic warehouses survive from the sailing era, the Killam Brothers and Parker-Eakin&#x27;s buildings, each with an associated wharf, which are the focal points of summer waterfront events.

Yarmouth&#x27;s Main Street is marked by several distinctive Victorian commercial buildings such as the turreted Yarmouth Block Building. The largest building in the town is a 1970s hotel, the Rodd Grand Hotel. It is built on the site of the original Grand Hotel, a Second Empire hotel which was the town&#x27;s landmark for many years.

A landmark for Yarmouth Harbour is the large Cape Forchu Lighthouse which is located a few kilometres away at the headland of Cape Forchu, the peninsula that guards Yarmouth Harbour. The tall &quot;apple core&quot; style is a notable example of modernist style light tower.

==Climate==
Yarmouth has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), typical of climates surrounded by the sea but close to large continents such as southern Norway and coastal Hokkaido but with latitude variations. Being near the -3 °C isotherm in the average of the coldest month (east of the city), causing that in peninsular areas like Yarmouth Bar and Cape Forchu are between a transition band for the oceanic climates (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Winters are cool and rainy with a January average of though owing to strong maritime influences, temperatures below are very rare, and the average high never drops to below freezing at any point in the year. During this period of time, the weather can be unsettled and cloudy due to the Nor&#x27;easters coming up the coast from the southwest. As a result, Yarmouth averages only 68–100 hours of sunshine from December to February or 25%–34% of possible sunshine. The average annual snowfall is , which can come from Nor&#x27;easters from the southwest with a maximum snow depth of in January, owing to its mild winters, among the mildest in Canada east of the Rockies.

Yarmouth&#x27;s summers are cool due to the strong coastal influence from the sea which keeps summer temperatures cool, meaning temperatures above are very rare. The average temperature in the warmest month, August is . Spring and fall are transitional seasons in which falls are warmer than spring since the waters are at the warmest temperatures in fall and the coldest during early spring. Precipitation is significant, averaging a year, with July and August the driest months on average and November the wettest month on average. An outstanding feature is Yarmouth&#x27;s late-fall to early-winter precipitation maximum, owing to the combination of intense storm activity from November to January and relatively more-stable summers, with thunderstorm activity here much less frequent than in the U.S. Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and points southward. Yarmouth averages 1,898.3 hours of sunshine or 41.2% of possible sunshine with summer being the sunniest and winter being the cloudiest. Yarmouth averages 191 days of fog each year.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Yarmouth was on July 16, 2013. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 14, 1894.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Yarmouth had a population of 6,829 living in 3,259 of its 3,569 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 6,518. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The town has long held the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the province. Many studies have been done using teenagers in the town to examine the phenomenon.

<doc id="248336" wikidata="Q6725567" url="?curid=248336" title="Macroprolactin">
<text>Macroprolactin is the term used to describe complexed forms of the pituitary hormone prolactin which are found in blood. The most common complex found in blood consists of prolactin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). While the free prolactin hormone is active, prolactin in the macroprolactin complex does not have any biological activity in the body and is considered benign. However, macroprolactin is detected by all Laboratory tests that measure prolactin in blood. This leads to misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia in many people, especially those with other symptoms, such as infertility or menstrual problems.

&quot;Macroprolactin&quot; is most commonly a complex of prolactin and IgG (typically IgG4), displaying a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa (which is hence 6–7 fold higher that the native molecule). Polymeric aggregate of highly glycosylated prolactin monomers or prolactin-IgA complexes (i.e. non-IgG-type macroprolactin) act similarly and also count as &quot;macroprolactin&quot;. 

In patients with hyperprolactinemia, the serum pattern of prolactin isoforms usually encompasses 60%–90% monomeric prolactin, 15%–30% big-prolactin (40–60 kDa: usually prolactin dimers or big-big degradation products) and 0%–10% big-big prolactin (&gt;100 kDa). The condition of macroprolactinaemia is hence defined as predominance (i.e. &gt;30%–60%) of circulating prolactin isoforms with molecular weight &gt;100 kDa.

There are certain chemicals, such as polyethylene glycol, that can be added to remove macroprolactin from a suspicious sample. The sample can then be re-analysed to see if the prolactin levels are still high. The gold standard test to diagnose macroprolactin is gel-filtration chromatography.

<text>Brandon () is the second-largest city in the province of Manitoba, Canada. It is located in the southwestern corner of the province on the banks of the Assiniboine River, approximately west of the provincial capital, Winnipeg, and east of the Saskatchewan border. Brandon covers an area of with a population of 51,313, and a census metropolitan area population of 54,268. It is the primary hub of trade and commerce for the Westman Region as well as parts of southeastern Saskatchewan and northern North Dakota, an area with a population of over 190,000 people.

The City of Brandon was incorporated in 1882, having a history rooted in the Assiniboine River fur trade as well as its role as a major junction on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Known as &quot;The Wheat City&quot;, Brandon&#x27;s economy is predominantly associated with agriculture, as well as health care, manufacturing, food processing, education, business services, and transportation.

Brandon&#x27;s post-secondary institutions include Brandon University, Assiniboine Community College, Robertson College, and the Manitoba Emergency Services College. Canadian Forces Base Shilo is located east of Brandon and maintains close ties with the city. Brandon&#x27;s Keystone Centre, is one of the largest consolidated entertainment, recreation, convention, and agriculture complexes in Canada and is the home of the Brandon Wheat Kings and the Royal Manitoba Winter Fair.

==History==
Prior to the influx of people from Eastern Canada, the area around Brandon was primarily used by the Sioux people, the Bungays, the Yellow Quills, and the Bird Tails. In the 1870s and early 1880s, the Plains Bison were nearly wiped out by over-hunting. With the destruction of their staff of life, the buffalo, the nomadic Sioux people began to agree to settle in reservations such as the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, or left the area entirely.

French Canadians also passed through the area on river boats on their way to the Hudson Bay Post, Fort Ellice located near present-day St. Lazare, Manitoba. The city of Brandon gets its name from the Blue Hills south of the city, which got their name from a Hudson&#x27;s Bay trading post known as Brandon House, which got its name from a hill on an island in James Bay where Captain James had anchored his ship in 1631.

During the 1870s it was believed by most that the transcontinental railway would take a northwesterly direction from Portage la Prairie. Many thought that the route would most likely go through either Minnedosa or Rapid City, Manitoba because they were both located at natural river crossings. Rapid City was the front runner for the site of the new railway and had prepared for the impending building boom accordingly. But suddenly, in 1881, the builders of the railway decided to take a more westerly route from Winnipeg, towards Grand Valley. Grand Valley was located on the northern side of the Assiniboine, opposite the side of the river where present-day Brandon sits.

Grand Valley was originally settled by two brothers John and Dougal McVicar, and their families. With the expectation of the new railroad, settlers and prospectors now rushed to an area they had previously avoided. Around 1879 a few settlers led by Reverend George Roddick had begun to build their new homes about south of Grand Valley, at the foot of the Brandon Hills.

Meanwhile, in Grand Valley with the promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each bringing more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser&#x27;s job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 () for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that &quot;I&#x27;ll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here&quot;. So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today&#x27;s current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.
After the location of the railway was once again changed, there was still hope that Grand Valley could become a rival neighbour to Brandon. But late in June 1881 it became clear that Grand Valley would not have lasted as a city long term. A flood hit in late June, and as the city was built on a low-lying part of the river, flooded quickly and dramatically. Because Grand Valley was built on a low flood plain, and Brandon was built on the heights on the other side, it became apparent that Brandon was the best place for a city in the area.

Rosser had chosen Brandon as the townsite in May 1881, within a year settlers had flocked to Brandon in such numbers that it was incorporated as a city. Brandon never spent any time as a town or village but has only existed as a city.

An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Brandon from September 1914 to July 1916. Post World War II, Brandon experienced a minor disaster when an explosion at the Manitoba Power Commission&#x27;s steam plant caused the 40 metre (130 ft) brick chimney to collapse, killing two workers in the process.

In contemporary times, Shari Decter Hirst defeated incumbent Dave Burgess in the 2010 municipal election to become the first female mayor of the city.

<text>Myron Carlton &quot;Tiny&quot; Bradshaw (September 23, 1907 – November 26, 1958) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues bandleader, singer, composer, pianist, and drummer. His biggest hit was &quot;Well Oh Well&quot; in 1950, and the following year he recorded &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, a song that was pivotal to the development of rock and roll. Bradshaw co-wrote and sang on both records.

==Early years==
Myron Carlton Bradshaw was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Cicero P. Bradshaw and his wife Lillian Boggess. Bradshaw graduated from high school in Youngstown. After graduating from Wilberforce University with a degree in psychology, Bradshaw turned to music for a living. In Ohio, he sang and played drums with Horace Henderson&#x27;s campus oriented Collegians. Then, in 1932, Bradshaw relocated to New York City, where he drummed for Marion Hardy&#x27;s Alabamians, the Charleston Bearcats (later the Savoy Bearcats), and the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, and sang for Luis Russell.

==Bandleader==

In 1934, Bradshaw formed his own swing orchestra, which recorded eight sides in two separate sessions for Decca Records that year in New York City. The band&#x27;s next recording date was in 1944 for Manor Records, at which point its music was closer to rhythm and blues. In 1947 Bradshaw recorded for Savoy Records under the auspices of label producer Teddy Reig.

The band recorded extensively for the rhythm and blues market with King Records between late 1949 and early 1955, and had five hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. His most successful record at the time was &quot;Well Oh Well&quot;, which reached number two on the R&amp;B chart in 1950 and remained on the chart for 21 weeks. Two follow-ups, &quot;I&#x27;m Going To Have Myself A Ball&quot; (no. 5, 1950) and &quot;Walkin&#x27; The Chalk Line&quot; (no. 10, 1951) also made the chart before a break of almost two years.

What is now Bradshaw&#x27;s best known recording was &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; (1951) — not a chart hit at the time — which passed from rhythm and blues history into rock&#x27;s legacy. The song was recorded by Johnny Burnette &amp; The Rock and Roll Trio in 1956 and by The Yardbirds with Jeff Beck in 1965. It was covered again by Aerosmith in 1974 and by Motörhead in 1977. Furthermore, Jimmy Page reported in an interview that the first song played, at the very first rehearsal of what would become the English rock band Led Zeppelin was &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;.

Bradshaw returned to the R&amp;B chart in 1953 with &quot;Soft&quot; (no.3), an instrumental later recorded by Bill Doggett, and &quot;Heavy Juice&quot; (no.9). Both of these 1953 hits featured Red Prysock on tenor saxophone.

Bradshaw&#x27;s later career was hampered by severe health problems, including two strokes, the first in 1954, that left him partially paralyzed. He made a return to touring in 1958. His last session that year resulted in two recordings, &quot;Short Shorts&quot; and &quot;Bushes&quot; (King 5114), which proved an unsuccessful attempt to reach out to the emerging teenage record market.

Weakened by the successive strokes as well as the rigors of his profession, Bradshaw died in his adopted hometown of Cincinnati from another stroke in 1958. He was 51 years old.

==Legacy==

Bradshaw is remembered for a string of rhythm and blues hits. As a bandleader, he was an invaluable mentor to important musicians and arrangers including Sil Austin, Happy Caldwell, Shad Collins, Wild Bill Davis, Talib Dawud, Gil Fuller, Gigi Gryce, Big Nick Nicholas, Russell Procope, Red Prysock, Curley Russell, Calvin &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; Shields, Sonny Stitt, Noble &quot;Thin Man&quot; Watts, and Shadow Wilson.

<text>The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) in December 1837. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the rebellion in Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), which started the previous month, that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to revolt.

The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838. While it shrank, it became more violent, mainly through the support of the Hunters&#x27; Lodges, a secret United States–based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes, and launched the Patriot War in 1838.

Some historians suggest that although they were not directly successful or large, the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late-18th- and early-19th-century Atlantic Revolutions including the American Revolutionary War in 1776, the French Revolution of 1789–99, the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1804, the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the independence struggles of Spanish America (1810–1825). While these rebellions differed in that they also struggled for republicanism, they were inspired by similar social problems stemming from poorly regulated oligarchies, and sought the same democratic ideals, which were also shared by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Chartists.

The rebellion in Lower Canada, followed by its Upper Canada counterpart, led directly to Lord Durham&#x27;s Report on the Affairs of British North America, and to The British North America Act, 1840, which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system, leading to the formation of Canada as a nation in 1867.

==Background==

===Political structure of Upper Canada===

Many of the grievances which underlay the Rebellion involved the provisions of the Constitutional Act of 1791, which had created Upper Canada&#x27;s political framework. 

The Family Compact dominated the government of Upper Canada and the financial and religious institutions associated with it. They were the leading members of the administration: executive councillors, legislative councillors, senior officials and some members of the judiciary. Their administrative roles were intimately tied to their business activities. For example, William Allan &quot;was an executive councillor, a legislative councillor, President of the Toronto and Lake Huron Railroad, Governor of the British American Fire and Life Assurance Company and President of the Board of Trade.&quot; Members of the Family Compact utilized their official positions for monetary gain, especially through corporations such as the Bank of Upper Canada, and the two land companies (the Clergy Corporation and the Canada Company) that between them controlled two-sevenths of the land in the province. Lacking the minimum capital needed to found the bank, the corporate leaders persuaded the government to subscribe for a quarter of its shares. During the 1830s, a third of the bank&#x27;s board were Legislative or Executive Councillors, and the remainder all magistrates. Despite repeated attempts, the elected Legislature – which had chartered the bank – could not obtain details on the bank&#x27;s workings. Politician and former journalist William Lyon Mackenzie saw the bank as a prop of the Government and demanded farmers withdraw the money they had deposited in the bank and public confidence in the bank decreased.

===Demographic changes===

The government of Upper Canada feared a growing interest in American-inspired republicanism in the province because of the increase in immigration of American settlers to the province. The large number of migrants led American legislators to speculate that bringing Upper Canada into the American fold would be a &quot;mere matter of marching&quot;. After the War of 1812 the colonial government prevented Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. Relations between the appointed Legislative Council and the elected Legislative Assembly became increasingly strained in the years after the war, over issues of immigration, taxation, banking and land speculation.

===Political unions===

The Upper Canada Central Political Union was organized in 1832–33 by Thomas David Morrison and collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting William Lyon Mackenzie&#x27;s expulsion from the House of Assembly. The Reformers won a majority in the elections held in 1834 for the Legislative Assembly of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada but the Family Compact held the majority in the Legislative Council. The union was reorganized as the Canadian Alliance Society in 1835 and adopted much of the platform of the Owenite National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the Chartist movement in England. In pursuit of this democratic goal, the Chartists eventually staged a similar armed rebellion, the Newport Rising, in Wales in 1839. The Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society in 1836, and led by the more moderate reformer, William W. Baldwin. The Society took its final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837 and they organized local &quot;Vigilance Committees&quot; to elect delegates to a Constitutional Convention in July 1837. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion and most of the rebel organizers were elected Constitutional Convention delegates.

===Francis Bond Head and the elections of 1836===

Sir Francis Bond Head was appointed as Lieutenant-Governor and the Reform movement believed he would support their ideas. After meeting with Reformers, Bond Head concluded that they were disloyal to the British Empire and allied himself with the Family Compact. He refused proposals to bring responsible government to Upper Canada, responding in a sarcastic tone that belittled reformers. The Reform-dominated Assembly responded by refusing to pass the money bill, which halted the payment of salaries and pensions to many government workers. Bond Head then refused to pass any legislation from that government session including major public works projects. This caused a recession in Upper Canada. The movement was disappointed when Bond Head made it clear he had no intention of consulting the Executive Council in the daily operations of the administration. The Executive Council resigned, provoking widespread discontent and an election in 1834.

Unlike previous Lt. Governors, Bond Head actively supported Tory candidates and utilized Orange Order violence in order to ensure their election. He appealed to the people&#x27;s desire to remain part of the British Empire and a paternalistic attitude of the Crown providing goods for the people. Reformers such as Mackenzie and Samuel Lount lost their seats in the Legislature and they alleged that the election was fraudulent. They prepared a petition to the Crown protesting the abuses, carried to London by Charles Duncombe, but the Colonial Office refused to hear him. The new Tory-dominated Legislature passed laws that exacerbated tensions including continuing the Legislative session after the death of the King, prohibiting members of the Legislature from serving as Executive Councillors, making it easier to sue indebted farmers, protecting the Bank of Upper Canada from bankruptcy, and giving Legislative Councillors charters for their own banks.

===Collapse of the international financial system===

On July 10, 1832, US President Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill for the refinancing of the Second Bank of the United States, causing a depression in the Anglo-American world. This was worsened in Upper Canada by bad wheat harvests in 1836 and farmers were unable to pay their debts. Most banks – including the Bank of Upper Canada – suspended payments by July 1837 and successfully obtained government support while ordinary farmers and the poor did not. One fifth of British immigrants to Upper Canada were impoverished and most immigrant farmers lacked the capital to pay for purchased land. Debt collection laws allowed them to be jailed indefinitely until they paid their loans to merchants. In March 1837 the Tories passed a law making it cheaper to sue farmers by allowing city merchants to sue in the middle of harvest. If the farmer refused to come to court in Toronto, they would automatically forfeit the case and their property subjected to a sheriff&#x27;s sale.

Among the more than 150 lawsuits they launched that year, the Bank of Upper Canada, sued Sheldon, Dutcher &amp; Co., a foundry and Toronto&#x27;s largest employer with over 80 employees in late 1836, bankrupting the company. Mackenzie&#x27;s first plan for rebellion involved calling on Sheldon &amp; Dutcher&#x27;s men to storm the city hall, where the militia&#x27;s guns were stored.

===Budget of Upper Canada===
The Reformers were incensed at the debt that the Family Compact incurred as the results of general improvements to the province, such as the Welland Canal. 

The Upper Canada legislature refused to pass a supply bill in 1836 after Bond Head refused to implement responsible government reforms. In retaliation Bond Head refused to sign any bills passed by the assembly, including public work projects. This contributed to economic hardship and increased unemployment throughout the province.

==Planning==

Mackenzie gathered reformers on July 28 and 31, 1837 to discuss their grievances with the government. The meeting created the Committee of Vigilance and signed a declaration urging every community to send delegates to a congress in Toronto and discuss remedies for their concerns. Mackenzie printed the declaration in his newspaper and toured communities north of Toronto to encourage citizens to make similar declarations. Farmers organised target practice sessions and forges in the Home District and Simcoe County created weapons for the rebellion.

On October 9, 1837, a messenger from the Patriotes of Lower Canada informed Mackenzie that the rebellion in Lower Canada was going to begin. Mackenzie gathered reformers at John Doel&#x27;s brewery and proposed kidnapping Bond Head, bringing him to city hall and forcing him to let the Legislature choose the members of the Executive Council. If Bond refused, they would declare independence from the British Empire. Reformers such as Thomas David Morrison opposed this plan and the meeting ended without consensus on what to do next.

The next day Mackenzie convinced John Rolph that a rebellion could be successful and happen without anyone being killed. Rolph convinced Morrison to support the rebellion but they also told Mackenzie to get confirmation of support from rural communities. Mackenzie sought out support in rural communities but he also proclaimed that an armed rebellion would happen on December 7 and assigned Samuel Lount and Anthony Anderson as commanders. Rolph and Morrison were reluctant about the plan so Mackenzie sought Anthony Van Egmond to help lead the armed forces.

In November 1837, in the lead-up to the Political Union&#x27;s Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie published a satire in the &quot;Constitution&quot;, a round table discussion by John Locke, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Oliver Goldsmith and William Pitt and others. As part of this satire, he published a draft republican constitution for the State of Upper Canada that closely resembled the objectives in the constitution of the Canadian Alliance Society in 1834. Mackenzie printed broadsheets listing grievances and a call to arms to communities surrounding Toronto. Mackenzie also printed handbills declaring independence which were distributed to citizens north of Toronto. 

===Counter-rebellion planning===

Bond Head did not believe the reports that stated the severity of resources and discontent gathered by the rebels. In November 1837, James Fitzgibbon was concerned about soldiers leaving Upper Canada going to quell the Lower Canada Rebellion and urged Bond Head to keep some troops for protection, which was refused. Fitzgibbon&#x27;s call to arm a militia was also denied and he refused an armed guard at the Government&#x27;s House and City Hall. After the Battle of Saint-Denis Fitzgibbon prepared a list of men that he could contact personally if a rebellion began in Toronto. The mayor of Toronto refused to ring the City Hall bell if a rebellion began because he felt Fitzgibbon was causing unnecessary concern over a possible revolt.

A Tory supporter obtained a copy of Mackenzie&#x27;s declaration and showed it to authorities in Toronto. Government officials met at the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s residence on December 2 to discuss how to stop rumours of a rebellion. Fitzgibbon warned the men of rebels forging pikes north of the city and he was appointed adjutant general of the militia.

==Confrontation==
===Toronto Rebellion===

Rolph tried to warn Mackenzie about the warrant for his arrest but could not find him so delivered the message to Lount instead. Upon receiving Rolph&#x27;s message Lount marched a group of rebels into Toronto for December 4. When hearing about this change, Mackenzie quickly tried to send a messenger to Lount to tell him not to arrive until December 7 but was unable to reach Lount in time. The men gathered at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern but were disappointed at the lack of preparation and the failure of the Lower Canada rebels. Although Lount wanted to launch an attack that night, other rebels leaders rejected that plan so that the troops could rest after their march and they could get information from Rolph about the status of rebels who lived in Toronto. 

A loyalist named Robert Moodie saw the large gathering at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern and rode towards Toronto to warn the officials. The rebels set up a roadblock south of the tavern on Yonge Street that Moodie tried riding through. He was wounded in an ensuing battle and taken to the tavern, where he died several hours later in severe pain. Another horseman saw the rebel&#x27;s march into Toronto and notified Fitzgibbon, who tried unsuccessfully to have officials take action.

On December 4, Mackenzie and other rebels were patrolling the area and encountered Alderman John Powell and Archibald Macdonald. Mackenzie took both men prisoner but did not search them for weapons as they gave their word that they did not have any. As they were approaching Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern Powell mortally shot Anthony Anderson in the neck and escaped back to Toronto to report to Bond Head. The rebel leaders met that night to discuss who would become the rebellion&#x27;s leader after the death of Anderson and Lount&#x27;s refusal to lead on his own. It was decided that Mackenzie would become the leader.

At noon on December 5, Mackenzie gathered the rebels and marched them towards Toronto. Meanwhile, Bond Head proposed a negotiating session with rebel leaders to Marshall Spring Bidwell, who declined. Bond Head then offered a negotiation with Rolph, who accepted. Rolph and Robert Baldwin met the rebel troops at Gallows Hill and stated the government&#x27;s proposal of full amnesty to the rebels if they dispersed immediately. Lount and Mackenzie asked that this offer be presented in a written document and a convention be organised to discuss the province&#x27;s policies. When Rolph and Baldwin returned to Bond Head, they were informed that the government&#x27;s offer had been withdrawn. Rolph and Baldwin relayed the rejection to the rebels, and Rolph told Mackenzie that they should attack as soon as possible because the city was poorly defended. Instead, Mackenzie spent the day burning down the house of Bank of Upper Canada official and questioning the loyalty of his troops.

A few hours later Rolph sent a messenger to Mackenzie that Toronto rebels were ready for their arrival to the city and Mackenzie marched his troops towards Toronto. A group of twenty-six men led by Samuel Jarvis met the rebels on their march and fired upon them before running away. The rebels believed there were several battalions of troops firing upon them and several ran away. Lount encouraged some riflemen to return fire before realising that the enemy had left the battlefield. Lount and the riflemen marched to find the rebels who fled and found Mackenzie trying to convince the rebels to continue their path towards Toronto. The rebels refused to march until daylight.

On Tuesday night MacNab arrived in Toronto with sixty men from the Hamilton area. Morrison was arrested and charged with treason while Rolph sent a letter encouraging Mackenzie to send the rebels home then fled to the United States. Mackenzie ignored the letter and continued his plan for rebellion. 

On Wednesday morning Peter Matthews arrived at the tavern with sixty men, but Mackenzie could still not convince the rebel forces to march towards Toronto. Instead, they decided to wait for Anthony Van Egmond to lead the rebellion into Toronto. The rebels raided a mail coach, stole the passenger&#x27;s money and looked for information about the progress of the rebellion in London, Upper Canada. Mackenzie also attacked other travellers and robbed them or questioned them about the revolt.

The government organised a council of war and agreed to attack the rebels on December 7. Fitzgibbon was appointed commander of the government&#x27;s forces. Although initially believing the government&#x27;s position was untenable he was inspired by a company of men that formed to defend the government. At noon Bond Head ordered that the troops, consisting of 1200 men and two cannons, march towards the rebels.

==Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern==
Anthony Van Egmond arrived at the tavern on December 7 and encouraged the rebel leaders to disperse, as he felt the rebellion would not be a success. His advice was rejected, so he proposed entrenching and defending their position at the tavern. Mackenzie disagreed and wanted to attack the government troops. They agreed to send sixty men to the Don Bridge to divert government troops. That afternoon a sentinel reported the government force&#x27;s arrival from Gallows Hill. At this point only 200 men at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern were armed. The armed forces were split into two companies and went to fields on both sides of Yonge Street. The rebels without arms were sent to the tavern with their prisoners.

The government forces also split into two companies when the rebels fired upon them. The rebels dispersed in a panic after the first round of firing thinking the rebel&#x27;s front row had been killed when they were simply dropping to the ground to allow those behind them to fire. The government continued their march and at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern a cannon shot into the dining room window. The rebels fled north and the morale of the rebellion was irreparably broken. Bond Head ordered the tavern to be burned down and the rebels arrested.

==London Rebellion==
News of the intended rebellion had reached London, Upper Canada and its surrounding townships by December 7. It was initially thought that the Toronto rebellion was successful, contributing to Charles Duncombe wanting to rise up as well. Upon hearing more details about the rebellion in Toronto, Duncombe convened a series of public meetings to spread news of the supposed atrocities committed by Bond Head against all suspected reformers to help increase anti-government support. It is estimated that there were between 400 and 500 rebels who assembled under Duncombe.

Colonel Allan MacNab, who had just finished leading Upper Canadian militiamen during the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern, was sent to engage Duncombe&#x27;s uprising. He left Hamilton, Ontario on December 12 and arrived in Brantford on December 13. Although many rebels, including Duncombe, had fled prior to the upcoming battle due to hearing about the failure of Mackenzie in Toronto and general disorganization, there were still some present in Scotland, Ontario and MacNab commenced his attack on Scotland on December 14, causing the remaining rebels to flee after only a few shots were fired. The victorious Tory supporters burned homes and farms of known rebels and suspected supporters. In the 1860s, some of the former rebels were compensated by the Canadian government for their lost property in the rebellion aftermath.

==Patriot war==

The rebels from Toronto travelled to the United States in groups of two. Mackenzie, Duncombe, Rolph and 200 supporters fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River and declared themselves the Republic of Canada on December 13. They obtained supplies from supporters in the United States, resulting in British reprisals (see Caroline affair). On January 13, 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States mainland where he was arrested for violating the Neutrality Act. 

The rebels continued their raids into Canada using the U.S. as a base of operations and, in cooperation with the U.S. Hunters&#x27; Lodges, dedicated themselves to the overthrow of British rule in Canada. The raids did not end until the rebels and Hunters were defeated at the Battle of the Windmill, just eleven months after the initial battle at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern.

==Consequences: execution or transportation==

The British government was concerned about the rebellion, especially in light of the strong popular support for the rebels in the United States and the Lower Canada Rebellion. Bond Head was recalled in late 1837 and replaced with Sir George Arthur who arrived in Toronto in March 1838. Parliament also sent Lord Durham to become Governor-in-Chief of the British North American colonies, so that Arthur reported to Durham. Durham was assigned to report on the grievances among the British North American colonists and find a way to appease them. His report eventually led to greater autonomy in the Canadian colonies and the union of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada in 1840.

Over 800 people were arrested after the rebellion for being Reform sympathisers. Van Egmond died of an illness he acquired while imprisoned while Lount and Peter Matthews were sentenced to the gallows for leading the rebellion. Other rebels were also sentenced to hang and ninety-two men were sent to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. A group of rebels escaped their prison at Fort Henry and travelled to the United States. A general pardon for everyone but Mackenzie was issued in 1845, and Mackenzie himself was pardoned in 1849 and allowed to return to Canada, where he resumed his political career.

==Historical significance==

John Charles Dent, writing in 1885, said the rebellion was a reaction from the public of the government mismanagement of the minority ruling elite. Frederick Armstrong believed the rebellion was a reaction to patronage afforded to members of the Family Compact after winning the 1836 election. Dent wrote that the rebellion caused England to notice the concerns of Canadian reformers and reconsider their colonial rule of the province. He thought the rebellion hastened the changes Reformers advocated by drawing attention to the province from the Colonial Office and the production of the &quot;Durham Report&quot;.

Paul Romney argued that the above assessments are a failure of historical imagination and the outcome of an explicit strategy adopted by reformers in the face of charges of disloyalty to Britain in the wake of the Rebellions of 1837. In recounting the “myths of responsible government”, Romney opined that after the ascendancy of Loyalism as the dominant political ideology of Upper Canada any demand for democracy or for responsible government became a challenge to colonial sovereignty. In his view, the linkage of the &quot;fight for responsible government&quot; with disloyalty was solidified by the Rebellion of 1837, as reformers took up arms to finally break the &quot;baneful domination&quot; of the mother country. Struggling to avoid the charge of sedition, reformers later purposefully obscured their true aims of independence from Britain and focused on their grievances against the Family Compact. Thus, responsible government became a &quot;pragmatic&quot; policy of alleviating local abuses, rather than a revolutionary anti-colonial moment.

William Kilbourn stated that the removal of Radicals from Upper Canada politics, either through execution or their retreat to the United States, allowed the Clear Grits to be formed as a more moderate political force that had fewer disagreements with the Tories than the reformers.

<text>An edict is a decree or announcement of a law, often associated with monarchies, but it can be under any official authority. Synonyms include &quot;dictum&quot; and &quot;pronouncement&quot;. &quot;Edict&quot; derives from the Latin .

==Notable edicts==
* Telepinu Proclamation, by Telipinu, king of the Hittites. Written c. 1550 BC, it helped archeologists to construct a succession of Hittite Kings. It also recounts Mursili I&#x27;s conquest of Babylon.
* Edicts of Ashoka, by the Mauryan emperor, Ashoka, during his reign from 272 BC to 231 BC.
* Reform of Roman Calendar, Julian Calendar, took effect on 1 January AUC 709 (45 BC).
* Edictum perpetuum (129), an Imperial revision of the long-standing Praetor&#x27;s Edict, a periodic document which first began under the late Roman Republic (c. 509–44 BC).
* Edict on Maximum Prices (301), by Roman Emperor Diocletian. It attempted to reform the Roman system of taxation and to stabilize the coinage.
* Edict of Toleration (311), by Galerius before his death. This proclamation removed all previous restrictions on the Christian religion, allowing it and all other religions to be practiced throughout the Roman Empire.
* Edict of Milan (313), by Constantine the Great, and Licinius, the Eastern tetrarch. It declared that the Roman Empire would be neutral with regard to religious worship, officially ending all government-sanctioned religious persecution, especially of Christianity.
* Edict of Paris (614), by Clotaire II of Neustria. It tried to establish order by standardising the appointment process for public officials across the realm. It guaranteed the nobility their ancient rights, and in this respect has been seen as a French Magna Carta.
* Edict of Pistres (864), by Charles the Bald. It reformed the West Frankish army and laid the foundations for the famous French chivalry of the High Middle Ages. It also ordered the construction of fortified bridgeheads to deal with Viking raiders.
* Edict on the Transfer of the Capital (1010), by Lý Thái Tổ, founder of the Lý dynasty. The capital of Đại Cồ Việt was shifted from Hoa Lư to Đại La as a result.
* Edict on the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name (1271), by Kublai Khan (Emperor Shizu) of the Yuan dynasty of China. The edict promulgated the dynastic title of &quot;Great Yuan&quot;, officially established the Yuan dynasty as a Chinese dynasty, and explicitly claimed political succession from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty.
* Edict of Expulsion (1290), by King Edward I of England. It ordered the expulsion of all Jews from England and the confiscation of their real property.
* Edict of Worms (1521), by the Diet of Worms, with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V presiding. It declared Martin Luther to be an outlaw and banned the reading or possession of his writings. The edict permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.
* Edict of Saint-Germain (1562), by Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France, in January 1562. It was an edict of toleration that recognized the existence of the Protestants and guaranteed freedom of conscience and private worship. It forbade Huguenot worship within towns (where conflicts flared up too easily), but permitted Protestant synods and consistories.
* Edict of Nantes (1598), by King Henry IV of France. It granted all of the above listings the French Protestants (also known as Huguenots) substantial rights in France, a Catholic nation.
* Edict of Restitution (1629), by Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. It attempted to restore the religious and territorial settlement after the Peace of Augsburg (1555). It forbade the secularization of land and property belonging to the Catholic Church.
* Sakoku Edict (1635), the third of a series issued by Tokugawa Iemitsu, &quot;shōgun&quot; of Japan from 1623 to 1651. The Edict of 1635 is considered a prime example of the Japanese desire for isolationism (). This decree is one of the many acts that were written by Iemitsu to eliminate Catholic influence, and enforced strict government rules and regulations to impose these ideas. The Edict of 1635 was written to the two commissioners of Nagasaki, a port city located in southwestern Japan.
* Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), by Louis XIV of France. It revoked the Edict of Nantes (1598) and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches.
* Sacred Edict (1670), by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty of China. Made up of 16 maxims, it served to instruct the average Chinese people of the basic principles of Confucianism. The Sacred Edict was subsequently expanded upon in a separate edict issued by the Yongzheng Emperor in 1724.
* A French edict by Finance Minister Colbert (17th century) was intended to improve the quality of cloth. This law declared that if a merchant&#x27;s cloth was not found to be satisfactory on three occasions, then he was to be tied to a post with the cloth attached to him.
* Edict of Gülhane (1839), Ottoman edict that ushered in the Tanzimât period
* Edict of Toleration (1839), by King Kamehameha III of Hawaii. It allowed for the establishment of the Catholic Church in Hawaii.
* Hatt-ı Hümayun of 1856 (Reform Edict of 1856) by Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I, promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all regardless of creed.
* Imperial Decree of the Declaration of War Against Foreign Powers (1900), issued in the name of the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing dynasty of China, declared war against the Russian Empire, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Empire of Japan, the French Republic, the German Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Spain, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the Kingdom of Belgium, and the Netherlands simultaneously, which culminated in the Eight-Nation Alliance Invasion.
* Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor (1912), issued in the name of the Xuantong Emperor of the Qing dynasty of China, marked the end of the dynasty and 2133 years of imperial rule in China, whilst simultaneously transferred the sovereignty of China (including Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet) to the nascent Republic of China.

<text>The Cairo Declaration (Traditional Chinese: 《開羅宣言》) was the outcome of the Cairo Conference in Cairo, Egypt, on 27 November 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China were present. The declaration developed ideas from the 1941 Atlantic Charter, which was issued by the Allies of World War II to set goals for the post-war order. The &quot;Cairo Communiqué&quot; was broadcast through radio on 1 December 1943.

==Text==

&quot;The several military missions have agreed upon future military operations against Japan. The Three Great Allies expressed their resolve to bring unrelenting pressure against their brutal enemies by sea, land, and air. This pressure is already rising.&quot;

&quot;The Three Great Allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan. They covet no gain for themselves and have no thought of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.&quot;

&quot;With these objects in view the three Allies, in harmony with those of the United Nations at war with Japan, will continue to persevere in the serious and prolonged operations necessary to procure the unconditional surrender of Japan.&quot;
== Controversy as to Taiwan ==
The Cairo Declaration is cited in Clause Eight (8) of the Potsdam Declaration, which is referred to by the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.

Both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China have cited the Cairo Declaration as one of the bases for the One-China Principle that Taiwan and Penghu are part of Republic of China. However, the major political parties in Taiwan have not taken the same position on this matter, and various historians in Taiwan have said that the Cairo Declaration was not binding.

The government of the United States considers the declaration a statement of intention and never formally implemented. In November 1950, the United States Department of State said that no formal act restoring sovereignty over Formosa and the Pescadores to China had yet occurred;

In February 1955, Winston Churchill stated that the Cairo Declaration &quot;contained merely a statement of common purpose&quot; and the question of Taiwan&#x27;s future sovereignty was left undetermined by the Japanese peace treaty. British officials reiterated this viewpoint in May 1955.

In March 1961, then-Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs responded that: It was specified in Potsdam Proclamation that articles in Cairo Declaration should be carried out, and in accordance with Japanese Instrument of Surrender we announced that we would comply with Potsdam Proclamation. However, the so-called Japanese Instrument of Surrender possesses the nature of armistice and does not possess the nature of territorial disposition.

On the other hand, then-ROC president Ma Ying-jeou cited a series of instruments beginning with the Cairo Declaration and stated in 2014:
The implementation of the legal obligation to return Taiwan and its appertaining islands (including the Diaoyutai Islands) to the ROC was first stipulated in the Cairo Declaration, and later reaffirmed in the Potsdam Proclamation, the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and the Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan. The Cairo Declaration is therefore a legally binding instrument with treaty status.

== Controversy as to Korea ==
Many prominent Koreans in the Korean independence movement, including Kim Ku and Syngman Rhee, were initially delighted by the declaration, but later noticed and became infuriated by the phrase &quot;in due course&quot;. They took it to be an affirmation of Allied intent to place Korea into a trusteeship, rather than granting it immediate independence. There was significant concern that the trusteeship could be indefinite or last decades, making Korea functionally again a colony under a great power.

The phrase &quot;in due course&quot; was not present in the first draft; it originally read &quot;at the earliest possible moment after the downfall of Japan&quot;. The US suggested &quot;at the proper moment&quot;, and finally the British &quot;in due time&quot;. Exact motivations for these changes are unclear.

<text>Kingsburg is a village in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. The community is located approximately 130 kilometres from Halifax.

Kingsburg is also a protected cape.

==History==
King George III issued a land grant of approximately 1350 acres to foreign Protestant settlers, Leonard Hirtle, John Mossman, Peter Knack, Christian Hartman, John Kayser and Jacob Moser on July 5, 1787.

For decades, Kingsburg was a fishing and farming community. By the middle of the twentieth century, with the widespread decline of small-scale Atlantic fishery, most fishing culture had disappeared.

==Economy==
The evolution of Kingsburg into a vacation and retirement destination has had an impact on the population of the village. About 80% of the houses are vacant during most of the year.

Much of the rural infrastructure for Upper and Lower Kingsburg is centered in Riverport, Nova Scotia. This includes Riverport Electric, the first municipal utility incorporated in Nova Scotia, the Riverport &amp; District Fire Department, Riverport &amp; District Community Center, Riverport Community School and Riverport Post Office.

==Geography==

The Kingsburg Peninsula extends from Rose Bay, around the headlands of Rose Head, Hell Point and Gaff Point to the LaHave River estuary. The Greater Kingsburg Peninsula includes the defined area plus West Ironbound Island. Neighbouring areas to the Kingsburg Peninsula include Upper Kingsburg and Lower Rose Bay.

<doc id="248351" wikidata="Q2517563" url="?curid=248351" title="Mario Is Missing!">
<text>Mario Is Missing! is a 1993 educational game developed and published by The Software Toolworks for MS-DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, later released on Macintosh in 1994. The player controls Luigi, who must travel around the world to find and return stolen treasures as part of a quest to locate his brother, Mario, who has been captured by Bowser. &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot;, part of a series of educational &quot;Mario&quot; games, was Luigi&#x27;s second starring role in a video game, following the 1990 Game Watch game &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Hammer Toss&quot; and preceding the 2001 GameCube game &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; is an educational game. The computer version is a point-and-click adventure while the NES and SNES have platformer elements. In the game, Bowser, king of the Koopas, has relocated from the Mushroom Kingdom to the real world where he has set up his headquarters in an Antarctic castle. Bowser plans to steal the Earth&#x27;s treasures with the use of the Passcode-Operated Remote Transportation and Larceny System (PORTALS) which allows his Koopas to teleport anywhere in the world. Bowser intends to sell the treasures to pay for enough hairdryers so he can melt the ice of Antarctica. He captures Mario to prevent him from foiling the plan and it is up to Mario&#x27;s brother Luigi to save him.

The player controls Luigi throughout the game. At the beginning of the game, Luigi and dinosaur Yoshi are at Bowser&#x27;s castle and Luigi has access to the PORTALS, allowing him to teleport to cities where the Koopas are operating. The player can view a map of the city that Luigi is in, as well as a map of the world known as the Globulator. The player can use the Globulator to control Yoshi&#x27;s movements across the world, which is necessary to reunite Yoshi with Luigi. The player has access to a computer which keeps track of various clues learned throughout the game, including information gained from speaking to people in the cities Luigi visits and pamphlets regarding the landmarks that have had something stolen from them.

Notable locations in the game include Cairo, New York City, Mexico City, Paris, Buenos Aires and Tokyo. Missing artifacts include Big Ben, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Upon arriving in each city, the player must figure out what city Luigi is in and determine what artifact has been stolen and where it can be found. To figure these out, the player must talk to local people and ask them questions. Each city contains multiple tourist information centers as well as three stolen treasures, which are obtained by dispatching the Koopa who is carrying each one. In the version for Macintosh PC and MS-DOS, the number of treasures which have to be retrieved from the Koopas in each city varies, ranging between three and five that need to be recovered and returned. The treasure must be taken to the correct tourist information center, where the attendant in charge of the center asks the player general questions about the artifact they are returning to ensure it is authentic. When the artifact is restored, a picture is taken of Luigi with the artifact and is placed into a photo album. The player must summon Yoshi to Luigi&#x27;s current location so the dinosaur can eat a Pokey that is blocking the level exit leading back to Bowser&#x27;s castle. After helping five cities recover their missing artifacts, Luigi faces one of Bowser&#x27;s Koopaling kids blocking the way up to the next floor. After beating all of them he defeats Bowser, stops his plan and rescues Mario. The ending differs between versions: the SNES version has Luigi send Bowser flying out of his castle with a cannon where he lands in the snow, freezes solid, and then breaks up into pieces. The Macintosh and MS-DOS version has him attempt to attack Luigi before he can stop his plan, only for Luigi to avoid him and pull off his shell, leaving Bowser to slink away in embarrassment while Luigi retrieves the key to Mario&#x27;s cell from the shell. Bowser returns and Luigi dupes him into looking for the key in the snow below, allowing Luigi to kick him over the wall into the snow before then releasing Mario, reuniting with Yoshi and heading for home with Bowser&#x27;s plan thwarted.

==Development and release==
To capitalize on educational games which were popular at the time, Nintendo partnered with The Software Toolworks to create an educational Mario game. Nintendo licensed the Mario characters, but was otherwise not involved in the game&#x27;s development nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. The Software Toolworks released the game for MS-DOS in January 1993. Its lead designer was Donald W. Laabs, who saw working with Nintendo as a way to compete with &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; creator Broderbund and hoped to license Mario for that purpose. They were able to get a licensing agreement due to one of the company&#x27;s executives&#x27; strong relationship with Nintendo of America, and because Nintendo was also interested in making educational games featuring Mario. This made them the first non-Nintendo studio to produce a &quot;Mario&quot; game on a console. They also hired staff that worked on &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;. The lead artist had to attend a Mario art school in Japan to learn how to present &quot;Mario&quot; characters. Laabs noted that the Japanese branch of Nintendo did not seem to fully realize the deal which Nintendo of America made, and they insisted &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; not be confused with a traditional &quot;Mario&quot; game. Laabs had no expectations that they could make a game which was the same caliber of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; games due to the close collaboration between the software and hardware teams at Nintendo. The team made a point of using other &quot;Mario&quot; games for reference during development. Whereas &quot;Mario&quot; games are able to pose a challenge, the team aimed to make sure that it could be enjoyed by young children. The members of the team who wanted to make a &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; competitor competed with those who wanted to make a traditional action-based game, though they had to adhere to Nintendo&#x27;s guidelines, and thus had to find a good balance between a &quot;Mario&quot; experience and an educational experience. Laabs was responsible for all versions, with each team reporting to him. &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; marked Luigi&#x27;s first starring role in a video game, followed by the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; series of games.

Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993. By October 1993, Mindscape had published said NES and SNES versions in Europe. The SNES version used audio and visual assets from &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. The DOS version uses stretched-out character animations unlike the later versions. The DOS version was programmed by Jeff Chasen.

In the United States, The Software Toolworks released a Macintosh version on CD-ROM and floppy disks in June 1994 under the title &quot;Mario Is Missing! CD-ROM Deluxe&quot;. The new version included 127 QuickTime clips featuring 99 landmarks, like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Great Wall of China.

==Reception==

Due to the educational content rather than action-adventure that players of the time were used to, reception of the title was initially mixed. Still, profits of the NES and SNES versions exceeded $7 million for The Software Toolworks during the second quarter of 1993.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewed the SNES version at the time of its release: three of the magazine&#x27;s four reviewers commented the game is too slow and easy for experienced players, but that it offers great appeal to its young target audience while providing good educational value. Reviewers for &quot;GameFan&quot; praised the game&#x27;s SNES version and compared it to &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; noted the game&#x27;s &quot;excellent&quot; graphics. &quot;GamePro&quot;, reviewing the SNES version, called the game &quot;a good way to learn geography&quot; but wrote that players should not expect it to be exciting. The magazine also noted that younger players would need help in progressing through the game.

&quot;Nintendo Magazine System UK&quot; reviewed the SNES version and wrote that it succeeded as both an educational and entertaining game, while noting it would only be suitable for people of a certain age. &quot;SNES Force&quot; criticized the graphics and the restricted gameplay, adding that it was too easy for older players and too difficult for younger players. &quot;Total!&quot; wrote that the NES version was not as good as the SNES version, stating it was missing &quot;a bit of the graphical humour – but it packs in almost as much game-play and educational value&quot;.

Chris Cavanaugh of AllGame reviewed the SNES version and considered it to be &quot;somewhat enjoyable&quot; for children, but believed that adult players would not be interested. Cavanaugh noted the colorful graphics yet criticizing the repetitive gameplay and the &quot;virtually identical&quot; appearances of each city. AllGame&#x27;s Skyler Miller reviewed the NES version and noted the graphics were washed-out and lacking in detail, but wrote that the overall game was &quot;as good as can be expected&quot; for an NES Mario game which was not created by Nintendo. Miller mentioned that the game should appeal to younger players because of its &quot;relatively seamless&quot; combination of instruction and action. Lisa Karen Savignano of AllGame reviewed the Macintosh version and considered it to be an enjoyable game with adequate graphics, but also stated that it was a simple game intended for young players. Savignano called the music &quot;quite nice&quot;, but noted the basic sound effects and the lack of voiceovers.

Critical consensus of the game has changed over time. Luke Plunkett of &quot;Kotaku&quot; wrote in 2012 that unlike the NES and SNES versions, the PC version &quot;was the star, featuring not only more content but better visuals as well&quot;. He considered the game &quot;awful&quot; and not very educational. Kevin Wong of &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted in 2015 that the game was poorly received in many online reviews, although Wong himself praised the character animations and music. He opined that the backlash against &quot;Mario Is Missing&quot; comes down to measured expectations; what is suitable or primally engaging at a young age could be dull and tedious at another.

In 2016, Samuel Roberts of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; noted the computer version had poor pixel art and that every street has the same buildings on it, and all the NPCs are the same regardless where the players are going. Roberts also wrote that the game was &quot;conceptually baffling and hated&quot; by Nintendo fans. In 2017, Seth Macy of 
&quot;IGN&quot; included the game on a list of the &quot;Weirdest Mario Games Ever Made&quot;, writing that the game&#x27;s weirdest aspect is how Bowser weaponizes climate change to melt the ice of Antarctica, flooding the Earth so he can steal landmarks.

&quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; garnered $7 million in the second quarter of 1993, and kickstarted multiple educational games in the &quot;Mario&quot; series. Despite negative reception, lead designer Donald W. Laabs acknowledged the reality of game development, while also acknowledging that the marketing of it as a traditional &quot;Mario&quot; game earned criticism.

<text>Wouter Jacob Bos (; born 14 July 1963) is a retired Dutch politician of the Labour Party (PvdA) and businessman.

Bos attended the Christian Gymnasium in Zeist from June 1975 until July 1980 and applied at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in June 1981 majoring in Political science and Economics obtaining a Bachelor of Social Science degree and a Bachelor of Economics degree in June 1984 before graduating with a Master of Social Science degree and a Master of Economics degree in July 1988. Bos worked as a human resource manager for Royal Dutch Shell from August 1988 until May 1998 in Pernis from August 1988 until September 1989 in Rotterdam from September 1989 until July 1991 in Bucharest, Romania from July 1991 until April 1993 in Hong Kong from April 1993 until November 1995 and in London, England from November 1995 until May 1998.

Bos was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1998, taking office on 19 May 1998 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. Bos was appointed as State Secretary for Finance in the Cabinet Kok II following the appointment of Willem Vermeend as Minister of Social Affairs and Employment, taking office on 24 March 2000. After the election of 2002 Bos returned as a Member of the House of Representatives, taking office on 23 May 2002 serving again as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. The Cabinet Kok II was replaced by the Cabinet Balkenende I following the cabinet formation of 2002 on 22 July 2002. After the Leader of the Labour Party and Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives Ad Melkert announced he was stepping down as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives following the defeat in the election, Bos announced his candidacy to succeed him. Bos won the leadership election defeating former Speaker of the House of Representatives Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven and former Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Klaas de Vries and was elected as Leader and Parliamentary leader and &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; (top candidate) for the election of 2003, taking office on 19 November 2002. The Labour Party made a large win, gaining 19 seats and became the second largest party and now had 42 in the House of Representatives. For the Dutch general election of 2006 Bos again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot;. The Labour Party suffered a loss, losing 9 seats and now had 33 seats in the House of Representatives. The following cabinet formation of 2006 resulted in a coalition agreement between the Labour Party, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the Christian Union (CU) which formed the Cabinet Balkenende IV with Bos appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, taking office on 22 February 2007. The Cabinet Balkenende IV fell on 20 February 2010 after tensions in the coalition over the extension of the Dutch involvement in the Task Force Uruzgan of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the Labour Party cabinets members resigned on 23 February 2010. On 12 March 2010 Bos unexpectedly announced his retirement from national politics and that he wouldn&#x27;t stand for the election of 2010 and approached Job Cohen as his successor.

Bos semi-retired from national politics and became active in the private sector and public sector, in October 2010 Bos became a partner at the financial services firm KPMG. After the election of 2012 Bos was appointed as co-Informateur for the cabinet formation of 2012. In August 2013 Bos was nominated as chairman of the board of directors of the VU University Medical Center. In September 2018 Bos was appointed as chairman of the board of directors of the Netherlands Investment Agency, taking office on 1 October 2018. Bos also serves as an lobbyist for several economic delegations on behalf of the government. As of 2022 he is the chairman of health insurance company Menzis.

==Life==
===Youth===
Bos was raised in a Doorbraak social-democratic family with a Protestant background in Vlaardingen. His father founded the ecumenical development cooperation fund ICCO, which he also led for many years. Between 1969 and 1974 Bos attended the Protestant elementary school de Beurthonk in Odijk. From 1974 he attended the Protestant high school Christelijk Lyceum in Zeist. In 1980 he graduated specializing in sciences and classics. In 1980–81 he was a Voluntary Instructor at the YMCA National Centre in Curdridge in the United Kingdom.

===Life before politics===
Bos became a member of the PvdA in 1981. In the same year he started studying Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. In 1982 he also took up Economics. In 1988 he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in both subjects.

From 1988 till 1998 he worked for Royal Dutch Shell in various positions. With a background in Shell, he differs from other Dutch leftwing politicians, who rarely have a background in a major multinational corporation. Bos began to work for Shell because he thought that &quot;the Dutch Left should not leave the business world to the Dutch Right&quot;.

Between 1988 and 1990 he worked at the Pernis Refinery as a management consultant, where he was a specialist on training and reorganisation. In 1990 he became policy advisor for the central board, specializing in labour relations and working conditions, he also served as representative of the central board in its dealings with the central works council. In 1992–93 he was stationed as general affairs manager for Shell Romania Exploration, where he was responsible for setting up the Romanian branch of Shell. In 1993 he was stationed in Hong Kong, to work as staff planning and development manager for Shell Companies in Greater China, responsible for the recruitment and selection of new manager for Shell in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. In 1996 he returned to Europe, and worked as a consultant for new markets for Shell International Oil Products in London, focusing on acquisition in developing LPG markets in South America and Asia. In 1998 he left Shell to enter Dutch politics. For a short while he was policy advisor for the PvdA parliamentary party in the lower house and a personal assistant of the party&#x27;s financial spokesperson, Rick van der Ploeg.

===Political life===

In 1998 he was elected into the lower house of parliament for the PvdA as finance specialist. He campaigned together with Rick van der Ploeg and Willem Vermeend as &quot;the Polderboys&quot; and gave lectures in economics at universities. In 2000, due to a cabinet reshuffle, he succeeded Willem Vermeend as staatssecretaris for Finance, and became responsible for taxation, monetary policy and finances of lower-level government. Together with Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm he was able to get parliamentary support for a radical reform of the tax system. After the May 2002 elections he returned to parliament, as a specialist on income policy and health affairs.

After the fall of the first Balkenende cabinet Bos was elected top candidate for the following elections and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the PvdA in the 2002 PvdA leadership election by 60% of the voting party members. He immediately became the chairman of the parliamentary party, succeeding Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven, and leaving her, Klaas de Vries and Jouke de Vries behind him by a 30% margin.

In the January 2003 election, Bos entered a head-to-head race with incumbent Prime Minister and leader of the Christian Democratic CDA, Jan Peter Balkenende. Under Bos the vote and seats of the PvdA nearly doubled from 15% (23 seats) in 2002 to 27% (42 seats) in 2003. This resurgence was partially credited to Bos&#x27; charisma and youthful appearance (and according to some journalists Bos&#x27; &quot;sexy touch&quot;). Balkenende&#x27;s CDA however remained largest the party by a margin of two seats. The ensuing coalition formation talks between Balkenende and Bos failed after several months. The CDA went on to form a government with the conservative liberal VVD, and the progressive liberal D66.

At that time Bos was the leader of the largest opposition party. He spent considerable time reforming the PvdA&#x27;s internal organisation and public image, together with the party&#x27;s chairman Ruud Koole. He was criticized for his silence on important reforms and issues, and his moderacy which resulted in other parties claiming opposition leadership, among them most notably the Socialist Party. Although still enjoying large public support, criticism about his &quot;style over substance&quot; approach to politics was voiced in this period. At the December 2005 party congress, Bos announced that he aspired to become Prime Minister of the Netherlands, should the PvdA succeed in becoming the biggest party after the next parliament elections. And in the 2006 municipal elections, a few months later, the PvdA performed particularly well, becoming the largest party in local government.

However, in the election campaign for the Dutch general elections of 2006 the PvdA – for the second time campaigning under his leadership – didn&#x27;t manage to maintain this position as biggest party. Some considered pension reforms proposed by him to embattle the consequences of an aging population as a reason for this decline in popularity. Others emphasized a declining confidence in Bos among parts of the electorate that perceived him as &quot;unreliable&quot;, as reason for this. Bos lost nine seats in the elections, which saw large gains for the main rival of Labour on the left side of the political spectrum, the more radical Socialist Party. Nonetheless, after these elections (and this time successful coalition talks with Prime Minister Balkenende), Bos became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance in the Fourth Balkenende cabinet, thereby breaking a campaign promise to only join a cabinet when he could hold the office of Prime Minister.

As part of the leadership of the PvdA he revoked his confidence in fellow party member Ella Vogelaar as Minister of Integration and Housing. She subsequently resigned her post on 13 November 2008. The Dutch parliamentary press chose him as politician of the year 2008, largely due to his crisis management of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 that included nationalization of the Fortis bank.

==Other activities==
* European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (2007–2010)

==Personal life==
In December 2002 Bos married Barbara Bos (the surname is a coincidence). The master of ceremonies of his marriage was Joop Wijn, the former State Secretary of finance for the CDA. Wouter and Barbara Bos have two daughters, Iris (5 February 2004) and Jula (3 January 2006) and a son Joppe (18 April 2009).

<text>Elk Island National Park is a national park in Alberta, Canada, that played an important part in the conservation of the plains bison. The park is administered by the Parks Canada Agency. This &quot;island of conservation&quot; is east of Edmonton, along the Yellowhead Highway, which goes through the park. It is Canada&#x27;s eighth smallest in area but largest fully enclosed national park, with an area of .

The park is representative of the northern prairies plateau ecosystem and as such, the knob and kettle landscape is a mix of native fescue grassland that has been converted to forage land dominated by non-native grasses, aspen parkland and boreal forest. As well, Elk Island hosts both the largest and the smallest terrestrial mammals in North America, the wood bison and pygmy shrew respectively.

== History ==

Elk Island National Park is situated in the Beaverhills area, which with its aspen thickets and easy access to water, has provided shelter for wintering herds of elk, bison and moose since times immemorial. Though there was never any permanent indigenous settlement in the area, there are over 200 archaeological remains of campsites and stone tool-making sites. The land has been influenced by the Blackfoot, Sarcee and Cree indigenous groups.

In early post-Contact history, the Beaverhills area was primarily used for commercial hunting. This led to overhunting and the virtual elimination of beaver from the area by the 1830s and of large ungulates by the 1860s. The area then became valuable for timber until 1894, when fire swept through the area. In 1899, the federal government designated the area the &quot;Cooking Lake Forest Reserve&quot;. But while the forest was protected, it did little to protect the moose, elk and deer populations. Thus, in 1906, 
five men from Fort Saskatchewan put forward $5000 and petitioned the federal government to set up an elk sanctuary, calling it &quot;Elk Park&quot;. Elk Island Park was later granted federal park status in 1913, and then designation as an official National Park under the National Parks Act which passed through the Canadian Parliament in 1930.

In 1951, a replica of a pioneer cabin was built in the park to honour the Ukrainian Canadians who pioneered the area. This replica, known as the Ukrainian Pioneer Home, was the first museum or historic site ever dedicated to Ukrainian immigration in Canada. It was later declared a Classified Federal Heritage Building by the federal government in 1993.

In terms of local governance, those lands within Elk Island National Park were incorporated as Improvement District (ID) No. 97 on April 1, 1958. ID No. 97 was renumbered to ID No. 13 on January 1, 1969.

== Wildlife ==

Elk Island is home to the densest population of ungulates (hoofed mammals) in Canada. A variety of mammal species including coyote, bison, moose, mule deer, lynx, beaver, elk, white-tailed deer, and porcupine are year-round residents. Black bears and timber wolves certainly roam within this park, but they are not commonly seen by wildlife viewers. Over 250 bird species can be found in the park at various times of year. Most notable among these are the red-necked grebes, American white pelicans, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, red-tailed hawks, American bitterns and the trumpeter swans.
=== Wildlife management ===
Elk Island National Park maintains a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, as well as around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia&#x27;s Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1948. Reintroduction of traditional species has been an important focus as well. Besides the success of the wood and plains bison introduction, beavers were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a trumpeter swan reintroduction programme, which was seeing mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population.

Elk Island National Park also remains a seed herd for repopulation efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 wood bison were relocated to the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison.

=== Bison conservation ===
Elk Island National Park has a prominent history in large ungulate conservation. As early as 1907,
the Canadian government bought one of the last and largest remaining pure-bred plains bison, the Pablo-Allard herd, from Montana. Close to 400 bison were shipped to Elk Island as a temporary until the fencing at Buffalo Park in Wainwright was completed. In 1909 the fence was finished and 325 bison were relocated to Buffalo National Park. However, 40–70 bison evaded capture and became the ancestors of today&#x27;s herd in Elk Island National Park. Since 2007, Parks Canada has actively managed a herd of about 400 pure-bred and disease-free plains bison and 300 wood bison in Elk Island. When the population exceeds this number, the excess bison are sold. The proceeds of the sales go to help finance the needs of national parks.

In the late 19th century, only 300 wood bison remained worldwide, almost exclusively in Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6,000–7,000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis, which infected the wood bison herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus it was thought that wood bison were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a disease-free, not fully but relatively pure wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. In 2007, the wood bison population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315.

Elk Island has become famous for exporting its ungulates to other conservation areas around North America, and even to Russia. In 1996, elk were sent to Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky. Starting in 2005, a series of plains bison deliveries were made to the American Prairie in northeastern Montana, including 94 head in 2010 and 72 in 2012. Three groups of 30 wood bison were sent to the Republic of Sakha, in the Russian Federation, partly to replace the extinct steppe bison in the habitat but also as protection against any disease wiping out the North American herd of that species.

Conservationists transferred fifty-three wood bison from this national park to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in June 2008. They were absent from Alaskan boreal forests for nearly one hundred years.

== Climate ==
== Activities and facts ==

Elk Island National Park is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year-round. Park user fees apply. Popular year-round activities include birding and wildlife gazing. Winter activities include unserviced camping, hiking, snowshoeing and cross country skiing. Summer activities include hiking, golfing, kayaking/canoeing, mountain biking, and unserviced camping. Services include telephones, potable water and year-round washrooms. Swimming is not recommended due to risk of contracting swimmer&#x27;s itch. Fires are allowed in designated fire pits.

In 1955, a bison cull was filmed for the John Ford film &quot;The Searchers&quot;.

On September 3, 2006, the Beaver Hills dark-sky preserve, which includes Elk Island National Park within its boundaries, was declared in a ceremony held at Astotin Lake.

<text>The World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools (WWASPS or WWASP) was an organization based in Utah, in the United States. WWASPS was founded by Robert Lichfield and was incorporated in 1998. WWASPS stated that it was an umbrella organization of the troubled teen industry. Many outside observers believe, however, that the WWASPS-affiliated institutions were actually owned through limited partnerships, many of which have used the same street address by WWASPS or its principal officials or their close relatives.

WWASPS is connected to several affiliated for-profit companies. These include Teen Help LLC, the marketing arm of WWASPS and the entity that processes admissions paperwork; Teen Escort Service, a teen escort company that transports teenagers to WWASPS facilities; R&amp;B Billing, which does tuition billing and payment processing; and Premier Educational Systems, LLC (also called Premier Educational Seminars), which conducts orientation and training workshops for parents whose children are in WWASPS facilities. WWASPS claims to have &quot;helped&quot; over 10,000 students with issues related to personal behavior.

Some participants and parents gave positive reports of their experiences, but others say that WWASPS programs were abusive. WWASPS has faced widespread allegations of physical and psychological abuse of the teenagers sent into its programs, resulting in a lawsuit filed against the organization in 2006. WWASPS officials report that the organization is no longer in business, and the facilities originally under it no longer associate with the name, but because of ongoing litigation, it has not been dissolved.

==Facilities==
WWASPS operated, or was associated with, several facilities in the United States and in other countries. In 2003, there were 2,300 students enrolled in its facilities and programs. At one time, WWASPS facilities had tuition income of more than $90 million per year.

In July 2007, World Wide&#x27;s president, Ken Kay, told the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; that only two schools remained in the WWASPS network, including Majestic Ranch Academy in Utah, which he said was likely to sever its ties with the organization. In a December 2010 newspaper article, Kay was reported to have said that the organization was no longer in business, but because of ongoing litigation, it had not been dissolved.

Schools and programs currently or formerly associated with the organization include the following:


==Related and spinoff programs and projects==
Some personnel formerly associated with WWASP schools and programs have gone on to establish or work at other similar institutions.

In 2005, Robert Lichfield and the Utah-based holding company, Golden Pond Investments Ltd., made an offer to buy the campus of the Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, to open a new school for adolescents needing help with discipline, responsibility and leadership skills. It was announced that the school would be directed by former WWASP staff member Randall Hinton and his brother Russell Hinton. The Hintons told Boonville officials that the proposed school would not be a part of WWASP. The Boonville City Council rejected the proposal.

Randall Hinton later tried to resurrect the WWASP format with a similar &quot;chain&quot; of schools called Right Directions, but the effort never got past the planning stages. Most likely, this was meant to allow WWASP to retain many of its former properties under a new name with a clean slate, but ostensibly it would have been an entirely new entity.

Ken Kay was superintendent of Browning Distance Learning Academy, a provider of homeschooling curriculum. Its materials were used by Mentor School in Costa Rica. As of 2022 no other school or homeschooling group has used Browning Distance Learning Academy, and it&#x27;s assumed the company went bankrupt after Mentor&#x27;s closure. Browning Distance Learning Academy does not seem to be up and running at this time.

==Controversy==
WWASPS and its associated institutions have been the target of criticism over their treatment methods, including allegations of severe abuse and torture by staff at programs supported by WWASPS. The programs have been the subject of legal investigations by several U.S. states. In 2003, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; interviewed 60 current and former program participants and parents; some gave positive reports of their experiences, while other participants and parents said that WWASPS programs were abusive.

A WebWire report on October 16, 2006, stated that children housed in WWASP programs were denied adequate food, denied access to toilets, forced to drink their own vomit, chained to dog cages, and emotionally and sexually abused.

Numerous former students or their parents have filed lawsuits against WWASPS, its personnel, or individual schools. Most have been settled out of court or dismissed for procedural reasons. For example, a 2005 lawsuit filed in California on behalf of more than 20 plaintiffs was dismissed because the judge found that California lacked jurisdiction. In June 2007, Utah attorney Thomas M. Burton told a reporter that six suits he had filed against WWASPS on behalf of his clients had been dismissed on procedural grounds. WWASPS president Ken Kay told an interviewer that lawsuits against WWASPS are ploys to get money, brought by people who &quot;are never going to be happy.&quot; A lawsuit filed in 2007 against WWASPS and its founder, Robert Lichfield, on behalf of 133 plaintiffs alleging physical and sexual abuse and fraudulent concealment of abuse brought negative publicity to Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, because Lichfield was one of six co-chairs of the Utah state fundraising committee for Romney&#x27;s campaign.

On several occasions, WWASPS and its principals have responded to criticism by suing their critics. Robert Lichfield sued two individuals associated with the International Survivors Action Committee (ISAC) for defamation, invasion of his privacy, and causing &quot;intentional interference with &#x27;prospective economic advantage&#x27;.&quot; That suit was pending as of April 2005. In May 2005 a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed (on jurisdictional grounds) a defamation lawsuit brought by WWASPS against a United Press International reporter who had done research for a news story about alleged abuse at several WWASPS schools. The reporter was accused of having made defamatory statements about WWASPS to &quot;potential students, former students, parents of potential and former students, an employee of a state agency responsible for licensing a member school, and a Utah attorney who had filed numerous suits against [WWASPS].&quot;

On August 31, 2007, Randall Hinton was convicted of one count each of third degree assault and false imprisonment, for mistreating students at the WWASP-affiliated Royal Gorge Academy, of which he was manager and co-founder. However, the jury returned verdicts of &quot;not guilty&quot; on four other counts of third-degree assault and one other count of false imprisonment. Hinton was sentenced to jail followed by probation.

In 2010, animals were removed from Carolina Springs Academy due to neglect and malnourishment. There were also several animal corpses found on the property.

<text>HSTN (an acronym for High School Television Network) was a short-lived Canadian English language category 2 digital cable specialty channel aimed at high school students.

==History==
On June 4, 2001, Frank Rogers, on behalf of a company to be incorporated, was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service called &quot;The High School Television Network&quot;, described as &quot;devoted to the lifestyles of high school students across Canada. Programming will focus on high school sports (non-professional), drama, music, concerts within the school system, talk and panel shows and news coverage of events pertaining to or affecting the student population. High School Television Network will also provide a medium to broadcast student films or videos completed as a class project or ventures on their own.&quot;

The channel launched in August 2002 as HSTN on Rogers Cable.

It planned to show high school sports, concerts, dance programs, plays, high school news and information, among others. During its early existence, however, it showed very little besides endless repeats of &quot;Sponsé&quot;, an amateur film made by high school students in Toronto. The channel signed off on October 15, 2002.

On February 28, 2003, HSTN Inc. was placed in receivership and was to be temporarily managed by SF Partners Inc. On September 30, 2005, SF Partners purchased the channel and planned to renamed it YES-TV. The channel was intended to relaunch at a later date. However, the service did not launch as intended.

<doc id="248363" wikidata="Q161220" url="?curid=248363" title="Dioscoreaceae">
<text>Dioscoreaceae () is a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants, with about 715 known species in nine genera. The best-known member of the family is the yam (some species of &quot;Dioscorea&quot;).

The APG system (1998) and APG II system (2003) both place it in the order Dioscoreales, in the clade monocots. However, the circumscription changed in the APG II system, with the 2003 system expanded to include the plants that in the 1998 system were treated in the families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae.

==Taxonomy==
The Dioscoreaceae were first described by Brown in 1810 as Dioscoreae, and alternatively referred to as Dioscorinae.

===Subdivision===
The circumscription of Dioscoreaceae has expanded over the years. For instance when Stenomeridaceae, as &quot;Stenomeris&quot; was also included in Dioscoreaceae as subfamily Stenomeridoideae together with &quot;Avetra&quot;, the remaining four genera were grouped in subfamily Dioscoreoideae, the two being distinguished by the presence of bisexual and unisexual flowers respectively.

===Genera===
, Plants of the World Online accepted four genera in the family:

<doc id="248364" wikidata="Q1198405" url="?curid=248364" title="The Blind Assassin">
<text>The Blind Assassin is a novel by the Canadian writer Margaret Atwood. It was first published by McClelland and Stewart in 2000. The book is set in the fictional Ontario town of Port Ticonderoga and in Toronto. It is narrated from the present day, referring to previous events that span the twentieth century but mostly the 1930s and 1940s. It is a work of historical fiction with the major events of Canadian history forming an important backdrop, for example, the On-to-Ottawa Trek and a 1934 Communist rally at Maple Leaf Gardens. Greater verisimilitude is given by a series of newspaper articles commenting on events and on the novel&#x27;s characters from a distance.

The work was awarded the Booker Prize in 2000 and the Hammett Prize in 2001 and also received a number of other nominations.

==Plot summary==
The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Iris Chase, and her sister Laura, grow up well-off but motherless in a small town in southern Ontario. As an old woman, Iris recalls the events and relationships of her childhood, youth and middle age, including her unhappy marriage to Toronto businessman Richard Griffen. The book includes a novel within a novel, the eponymous &quot;Blind Assassin&quot;,
a roman à clef attributed to Laura but published by Iris. It is about Alex Thomas, a politically radical author of pulp science fiction who has an ambiguous relationship with the sisters. That embedded story itself contains a third tale, a science fiction story told by Alex&#x27;s fictional counterpart to the second novel&#x27;s protagonist, believed to be Laura&#x27;s fictional counterpart.

The novel takes the form of a gradual revelation illuminating both Iris&#x27;s youth and her old age before coming to the pivotal events of her and Laura&#x27;s lives around the time of the Second World War. Laura and Iris live in a house called Avilion. Their mother dies at a young age leaving Reenie, the caretaker, to take on responsibility for the girls. As the novel unfolds, and the novel-within-a-novel becomes ever more obviously inspired by real events, Iris, not Laura, is revealed to be the novel-within-a-novel&#x27;s true author and protagonist. Though the novel-within-a-novel had long been believed to be inspired by Laura&#x27;s romance with Alex, it is revealed that &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; was written by Iris based on her extramarital affair with Alex. Iris later published the work in Laura&#x27;s name after Laura committed suicide upon learning of Alex&#x27;s death in the war.

Following the suicide, Iris realizes through her sister&#x27;s journals that Richard had been raping Laura for much of their marriage, blackmailing her to comply with him by threatening to turn Alex in to the authorities. Iris takes her young daughter Aimee and flees her home, threatening to reveal that Richard had impregnated Laura and forced an abortion on her. This move estranges Iris from the last people who were supporting her, and creates bitterness between her and the grown Aimee. Iris deceives Richard into believing that Laura was the one having an affair with Alex Thomas, which drives him to commit suicide. The novel ends as Iris dies, leaving the truth to be discovered in her unpublished autobiography that she leaves to her sole surviving granddaughter.

==Main characters==
* Iris Chase Griffen: The narrator and protagonist of the tale.
* Laura Chase: Iris&#x27;s sister, whose suicide opens the book and who is named as the author of the novel within.
* Richard E. Griffen: Iris&#x27;s ruthless, older husband with political ambitions.
* Winifred Griffen Prior: Iris&#x27;s fashionable, manipulative, and social-climbing sister-in-law.
* Alex Thomas: A young author with Communist sympathies who takes refuge in Avilion with the sisters&#x27; help.
* Cpt. Norval Chase: The father of Iris and Laura. After being seriously injured in World War I and later widowed, he begrudgingly runs the family button business while descending into alcoholism and depression.
* Reenie: The loyal Chase family housekeeper who becomes like a mother to Iris and Laura.
* Myra Sturgess: Reenie&#x27;s daughter (possibly by Cpt Chase), who aids Iris in her old age.
* Aimee Adelia Griffen: Iris&#x27;s daughter.
* Sabrina Griffen: Iris&#x27;s granddaughter.

==Reception==
Reception was mixed. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;Spectator&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; and &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot; reviews under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. According to &quot;Book Marks&quot;, primarily from American publications, the book received a &quot;positive&quot; consensus, based on ten critic reviews: four &quot;rave&quot;, one &quot;positive&quot;, four &quot;mixed&quot;, and one &quot;pan&quot;. 

A reviewer for &quot;Salon&quot; described the book as a &quot;cunning tale ... sketched with Atwood&#x27;s trademark dark humor and deft hand.&quot; The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; critic commented on &quot;Atwood&#x27;s crisp wit and steely realism&quot; and said the book &quot;brilliantly ... works to flesh out the dime-novel culture of the 1930s and to emphasize the precarious position of women.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Thomas Mallon was unimpressed, calling the book &quot;overlong and badly written&quot;. Adam Mars-Jones in &quot;The Guardian&quot; was less negative but characterized the book as a &quot;romantic tale&quot; with political elements bolted on.

The novel was awarded the Booker Prize in 2000 and the Hammett Prize in 2001. It was also nominated for Governor General&#x27;s Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002. Atwood withdrew it from consideration for the 2000 Giller Prize after being named to the jury for the award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it the best novel of 2000 and included it in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923. As of 2019, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; is Atwood&#x27;s second highest-selling novel after &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, having sold over half a million copies of hard-cover and paper-back combined. Sales of the novel jumped tenfold in 2000 after receiving the Booker Prize.

<doc id="248367" wikidata="Q3132677" url="?curid=248367" title="Infantry Attacks">
<text>Infantry Attacks () is a classic book on military tactics written by Erwin Rommel about his experiences in World War I. At the time of the book&#x27;s writing in the mid-1930s, Rommel&#x27;s rank was lieutenant colonel. Rommel had planned to write a successor called (in English: &quot;Tank Attacks&quot;) about tank warfare, and gathered much material during the North Africa Campaign. However, as a result of his perceived involvement in a failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler, he was forced to commit suicide before completing this work.

==Overview==
Rommel describes his &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; (shock troops) tactics, which used speed, deception, and deep penetration into enemy territory to surprise and overwhelm. Throughout the book, Rommel reports assigning small numbers of men to approach enemy lines from the direction in which attack was expected. The men would yell, throw hand grenades and otherwise simulate the anticipated attack from concealment, while attack squads and larger bodies of men sneaked to the flanks and rears of the defenders to take them by surprise. These tactics often intimidated enemies into surrendering, thus avoiding unnecessary exertion, expenditure of ammunition, and risk of injury.

===Contents===
The text is divided into six chapters:
* I. Movement War 1914 in Belgium and Northern France
* II. Fights in the Argonne 1915
* III. Position war in the High Vosges 1916, movement war in Romania 1916/1917
* IV. Fights in the Southeastern Carpathians, August 1917
* V. Attacking battle at Tolmein 1917
* VI. Pursuit of Tagliamento and Piave

==Translations==
Lieutenant Colonel Gustave E. Kidde published in Infantry Journal(1944) an abridged English translation. This edition was titled Infantry Attacks. ATTACKS published in 1979 and translated by J. R. Driscoll was the first unabridged and complete English language translation published in the United States. 

==Impact==
&quot;Infanterie greift an&quot; was first published in 1937 and helped to persuade Adolf Hitler to give Rommel high command in World War II, although he was not from an old military family or the Prussian aristocracy, which had traditionally dominated the German officer corps. It was printed in Germany until 1945. By then, about 500,000 copies had been published. The book is still in print, and was most recently published in German in 2015.

The book was also used throughout the West as a resource for infantry tactical movements. General George S. Patton was among the many influential military leaders reported to have read &quot;Infantry Attacks&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;, when it is clear to Patton that he is defeating forces he believes are commanded by Rommel during a tank battle, Patton says to himself, &quot;Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!&quot; However, in a previous scene in the film, Patton is awoken by his aides with news that an intercepted German radio message reveals that Rommel will attack Patton near El Guettar, Tunisia. Before this, the camera focuses on a book on Patton&#x27;s nightstand, &quot;The Tank in Attack (Panzer greift an)&quot;, a book which Rommel had planned to write but never completed.

<text>Desdemona () is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot; (c. 1601–1604). Shakespeare&#x27;s Desdemona is a Venetian beauty who enrages and disappoints her father, a Venetian senator, when she elopes with Othello, a Moorish Venetian military prodigy. When her husband is deployed to Cyprus in the service of the Republic of Venice, Desdemona accompanies him. There, her husband is manipulated by his ensign Iago into believing she is an adulteress, and, in the last act, she is murdered by her estranged spouse.

== Role in &quot;Othello&quot; ==

In the play&#x27;s first act, Desdemona has eloped with Othello, a Moor in the service of the Venetian Republic. Before the Duke of Venice, his councilmen, and her father, she proclaims her love for Othello and defends her choice. Her father reluctantly accepts the union but warns Othello that she will someday deceive him. When Othello is sent to Cyprus in the line of duty, Desdemona accompanies him with his ensign&#x27;s wife, Emilia, attending her.

In act 2, Othello&#x27;s lieutenant, Cassio, is disgraced in a brawl and falls from Othello&#x27;s favor. Iago suggests to Cassio that he importune Desdemona to intercede for him, which she does. Meanwhile, Iago persuades Othello that Desdemona has formed an illicit relationship with Cassio. However, many critics argue that the first seed of doubt is not issued from Iago but by Desdemona&#x27;s father:

It is Desdemona&#x27;s assurance and confidence in the honor and strength of the love she bears for Othello that inspires her boldness. Yet the passion of her love both arouses and unnerves her husband too, adding to the seeds of fear and suspicion.

When Emilia&#x27;s husband Iago sees Desdemona&#x27;s handkerchief, he steals it and forbids Emilia to disclose its whereabouts to Desdemona. Iago plants the article in Cassio&#x27;s room. Eventually, Othello sees Cassio with the handkerchief and accepts it as confirmation of Desdemona&#x27;s infidelity.

Desdemona is concerned over the loss of the handkerchief but maintains that its loss will not cause Othello to grow angry. Emilia is more cynical, especially after Othello violently asks to see it. Desdemona is confused over her husband&#x27;s behavior, which culminates in his striking her in public and calling her a whore.

Desdemona is deeply upset by her husband&#x27;s attacks but continues to assert her love. In the final act, Othello tells her that he knows she has been unfaithful, and is going to kill her. Despite Desdemona&#x27;s claims of innocence, Othello refuses to believe her, and when he tells her that Cassio has been killed, Desdemona cries out. Othello becomes enraged and strangles Desdemona, ignoring her pleas for mercy. When her maid Emilia rushes into the room, Desdemona rises weakly to defend Othello, then dies.

Eventually, Othello learns of Desdemona&#x27;s faithfulness after Emilia exposes Iago&#x27;s true nature before being stabbed to death by Iago, and out of complete remorse, Othello commits suicide, but only after angrily stabbing Iago (though not fatally) as retribution for his lies against Desdemona. Desdemona&#x27;s cousin Lodovico then orders that Iago be tortured and executed.

Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s 1930 essay &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare - Othello&quot; includes an extended character analysis of Desdemona.

== Performance history ==
The role has attracted notable actresses through the centuries and has the distinction of being the first role performed professionally by Margaret Hughes, the first actress to appear on an English public stage.

In a 1951 film version, Suzanne Cloutier played Desdemona opposite Orson Welles. The film won the grand prize Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival.

In a 1966 British film version, Maggie Smith played the character opposite Laurence Olivier. The film holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations given to a Shakespeare film adaptation. Maggie Smith and co-stars Olivier, Frank Finlay (Iago), and Joyce Redman (Emilia) all received acting nominations.

In a 1995 film version, Irène Jacob played the character opposite Laurence Fishburne.

There have been numerous screen modernisations of the play. In &quot;O&quot; (2001), Julia Stiles played a character based on Desdemona in a version of &quot;Othello&quot; set in a contemporary high school. A 2001 British made-for-television film featuring Keeley Hawes as Desdemona &quot;Dessie&quot; Brabant also updates the action, picturing John Othello (Eamonn Walker) and Ben Jago (Christopher Eccleston) as high ranking Metropolitan Police officers. In 2006, Omkara, a Bollywood version of Othello, Dolly Mishra (Desdemona) was played by Kareena Kapoor.

<doc id="248371" wikidata="Q2215032" url="?curid=248371" title="Socialist Education Movement">
<text>The Socialist Education Movement (, abbreviated 社教运动 or 社教運動), also known as the Four Cleanups Movement () was a 1963–1965 movement launched by Mao Zedong in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Mao sought to remove reactionary elements within the bureaucracy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), saying that &quot;governance is also a process of socialist education.&quot;

== Goals ==
During the 1960s, Mao&#x27;s view of class struggle focused on two distinct dimensions. One level was class struggle within society to avoid revisionism, a process which required socialist education. The second level was struggle within the Party itself to address bureaucratism and the fear that Party bureaucrats might become a new bourgeoisie.

Thus, the goal of the socialist education movement was to &quot;purify politics, purify economics, purify the organization, and purify thought&quot; in opposition to revisionism. Mao sought to make Communist Party cadres closer to the people and to increase revolutionary consciousness among younger people who had grown up after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;&quot; He described the movement as &quot;lifting the lid&quot; on class struggle in rural China and exposing the ox-demons and snake-spirits working against socialism.

== Course ==
During the Socialist Education Movement, higher level cadres were sent around the country to investigate the relationships between local cadres and the people. Urban young people were also encouraged to visit rural areas during breaks from school to learn about the conditions of rural people. Approximately 3.5 million officials and students were sent into rural China to implement the movement.

In rural China, mobile film projectionist units showed films and slideshows that emphasized class struggle and encouraged audience members to discuss bitter experiences onstage. Films termed &quot;emphasis films&quot; were released to support the aims of the Socialist Education Movement, and the film version of &quot;The White-Haired Girl&quot; was re-released to coincide with the campaign as well.

The campaign had immediate difficulties. Higher level cadres often did not want to be sent to rural areas of China. In a technique described as &quot;turning away the spearpoint,&quot; local cadres often sought to blame problems on former landlords or those who had been criticized during the 1957 Anti-Rightist Campaign.

== Aftermath ==
The Socialist Education Movement is regarded as the precursor of the Cultural Revolution. Mao became frustrated with resistance to the Socialist Education Movement and the experience further developed his view that the relationship between cadres and the people needed to be improved. When the Cultural Revolution began, rural regions had not yet completed the Socialist Education Movement, and the committees in charge of it converted into Cultural Revolution leading groups.

Following the Socialist Education Movement, the relationship between Mao and Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao&#x27;s potential successor, deteriorated. 

Some Chinese sources state that the Socialist Education Movement resulted in 77,560 deaths, with 5,327,350 people being persecuted. 

A positive outcome of the campaign was that urban youth gained greater experience with the conditions of life in rural China.

<doc id="248372" wikidata="Q416997" url="?curid=248372" title="Peptide hormone">
<text>Peptide hormones are hormones composed of peptide molecules. These hormones influence the endocrine system of animals, including humans. Most hormones are classified as either amino-acid-based hormones (amines, peptides, or proteins) or steroid hormones. Amino-acid-based hormones are water-soluble and act on target cells via second messenger systems, whereas steroid hormones, being lipid-soluble, diffuse through plasma membranes to interact directly with intracellular receptors in the cell nucleus.

Like all peptides, peptide hormones are synthesized in cells from amino acids based on mRNA transcripts, which are derived from DNA templates inside the cell nucleus. The initial precursors, known as preprohormones, undergo processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. This includes the removal of the N-terminal signal peptide and, in some cases, glycosylation, yielding prohormones. These prohormones are then packaged into secretory vesicles, which are stored and released via exocytosis in response to specific stimuli, such as an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels.

Prohormones often contain extra amino acid sequences necessary for proper folding but not for hormonal activity. Specific endopeptidases cleave the prohormone before secretion, producing the mature, biologically active hormone. Once in the bloodstream, peptide hormones travel throughout the body and bind to specific receptors on target cell membranes.

Some neurotransmitters are secreted and released in a manner similar to peptide hormones, and certain &quot;neuropeptides&quot; function as both neurotransmitters in the nervous system and hormones in the bloodstream.

When a peptide hormone binds to its receptor on the cell surface, it activates a second messenger within the cytoplasm, triggering signal transduction pathways that lead to specific cellular responses.

Certain peptides, such as angiotensin II, basic fibroblast growth factor-2, and parathyroid hormone-related protein, can also interact with intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus through an intracrine mechanism.

<text>Zhang Liao () (169 – late 222), courtesy name Wenyuan, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He served briefly in the state of Cao Wei, founded by Cao Cao&#x27;s successor Cao Pi, in the early Three Kingdoms period before his death. Formerly a subordinate of other warlords such as Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu, Zhang Liao joined Cao Cao around 198 after Lü Bu&#x27;s downfall at the Battle of Xiapi. Since then, he participated in many of Cao Cao&#x27;s military campaigns, including those against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and the Wuhuan tribes from 201 to 207. He is best known for his pivotal role in the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 214–215, in which he successfully defended Hefei from the forces of the warlord Sun Quan.

Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, named Zhang Liao as one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Yu Jin, Zhang He, Yue Jin and Xu Huang.

==Early career and service under Lü Bu==
Zhang Liao was from Mayi County (馬邑縣), Yanmen Commandery, which is present-day Shuocheng District, Shuozhou, Shanxi. He was a descendant of Nie Yi (聶壹), but his family name had been changed from &quot;Nie&quot; to &quot;Zhang&quot; to avoid association with his disgraced ancestor. When he was young, he served as a minor official in his home commandery, and experienced many frontier skirmishes against rebellious Donghu people during his youth.

Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Ding Yuan, the Inspector of Bing Province, heard of Zhang Liao&#x27;s combat skills and hired him as an assistant officer. Ding Yuan ordered Zhang Liao to lead troops from Bing Province to the imperial capital, Luoyang, to assist the General-in-Chief, He Jin. He Jin then sent him on a mission to Hebei, where Zhang Liao managed to recruit over 1,000 men to serve in He Jin&#x27;s army.

When Zhang Liao returned to Luoyang, the warlord Dong Zhuo had seized control of Luoyang in the aftermath of He Jin&#x27;s assassination, and replaced He Jin as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Han central government. Zhang Liao and his 1,000 troops then joined Dong Zhuo&#x27;s army. In 192, after Lü Bu betrayed and killed Dong Zhuo, Zhang Liao served as one of his deputies and became a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉).

About a month after he killed Dong Zhuo, Lü Bu came under attack by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers, who were led by Li Jue and Guo Si. They defeated him and forced him out of the imperial capital, Chang&#x27;an. Zhang Liao accompanied Lü Bu as they headed east and wandered around central and northern China until mid 195, when the warlord Liu Bei offered Lü Bu shelter in Xu Province. In 196, Lü Bu betrayed his host and seized control of Xu Province, after which he appointed a 27-year-old Zhang Liao as the Chancellor of Lu State (魯國; around present-day Qufu, Shandong). Despite technically a subordinate of Lü Bu, Zhang Liao was formally independent from Lü Bu as he holds office as prefect of Beidi at that time.

In 198, Lu Bu&#x27;s men were ordered to buy military horses. However, all the gold was plundered by Liu Bei&#x27;s army on the way. Therefore Zhang Liao fought Liu Bei&#x27;s forces along with Gao Shun, which prompted Liu Bei to ask Cao Cao for reinforcements, Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun to help Liu Bei. However, Gao Shun and Zhang Liao first jointly defeated Xiahou Dun, and then jointly defeated Liu Bei at Peicheng.

==Service under Cao Cao==
In 198, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian, defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi and executed him. Zhang Liao surrendered to Cao Cao and became one of his subordinates. He was commissioned as a General of the Household (中郎將) and received the peerage of a Secondary Marquis (關內侯). He was promoted to Major-General (裨將軍) later for his contributions in battle.

===Persuading Chang Xi to surrender===
In early 201, after Cao Cao defeated his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he first sent Zhang Liao to pacify the various counties in Lu State (魯國; around present-day Qufu, Shandong), and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army to attack a minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating.

Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan: &quot;Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He is also running short of arrows. I suspect he is having doubts, therefore he isn&#x27;t doing his best to resist us. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if I manage to persuade him to surrender?&quot; He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi&#x27;s home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.

When Cao Cao heard about how Zhang Liao persuaded Chang Xi to surrender, he scolded Zhang Liao: &quot;This isn&#x27;t what a great general should do.&quot; Zhang Liao replied: &quot;I was certain that Chang Xi wouldn&#x27;t dare to harm me because he knows that I am authorised by the imperial court and also because he is influenced by the prestige of you, my lord.&quot;

===Campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and the Wuhuan===
In 202, Zhang Liao accompanied Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shao&#x27;s sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at Liyang (黎陽; northwest of present-day Xun County, Henan). He was promoted to acting Central Resolute General (中堅將軍) for his contributions in battle. Later on, he followed Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shang at Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei) but were unable to conquer the city so they retreated in mid 203.

After Cao Cao returned to the imperial capital, Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), he sent Zhang Liao and Yue Jin to lead an army to conquer Yin&#x27;an County (陰安縣; north of present-day Qingfeng County, Henan) and relocate its residents to the south of the Yellow River.

In early 204, Zhang Liao followed Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shang at Ye again and they succeeded in capturing the city this time. Zhang Liao also led troops to the Zhao State (趙國; around present-day Neiqiu County, Hebei) and Changshan State (常山國; around present-day Shijiazhuang, Hebei) in Ji Province, where he persuaded the Heishan bandits and other opposing forces to surrender to Cao Cao.

In 205, Zhang Liao accompanied Cao Cao to attack Yuan Tan at Nanpi County and they defeated Yuan Tan. After the battle, Zhang Liao led an army to the coastal regions and defeated bandit forces led by Liu Yi (柳毅) from Liaodong. When he returned to Ye after the campaign, Cao Cao came out of the city and personally welcomed him back. Zhang Liao was reassigned to serve as General Who Defeats Bandits (盪寇將軍).

In around 206, Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao to counter the unrest in some counties in Jiangxia Commandery (present-day eastern Hubei). Zhang Liao achieved success and returned to his garrison at Linying (臨潁; present-day Linying County, Henan). He was promoted from a Secondary Marquis to a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯).

In 207, Zhang Liao followed Cao Cao on a campaign against Yuan Shang, who had allied with the Wuhuan tribes in northern China. When Cao Cao was preparing to attack the enemy in Liucheng (柳城; present-day Xingcheng, Liaoning), Zhang Liao warned him that Jing Province&#x27;s Governor Liu Biao take advantage of his absence from Xu to send Liu Bei to attack Xu and take control of the capital. However, Cao Cao felt that Liu Biao would not send Liu Bei to attack Xu because he did not trust Liu Bei, so he proceeded with the campaign against Yuan Shang and the Wuhuan. When they encountered the enemy, Zhang Liao displayed great fervour and strongly urged Cao Cao to launch an attack. Cao Cao was so impressed with Zhang Liao that he passed him his personal signal flag. Zhang Liao led the assault on the Wuhuan at White Wolf Mountain (白狼山; near present-day Lingyuan, Liaoning), defeated them and executed the Wuhuan chieftain Tadun.

===Suppressing a mutiny and a rebellion===
Around 208, when Cao Cao was preparing to attack Jing Province, he ordered Zhang Liao to garrison at Changshe (長社; present-day Changge, Henan) and wait to mobilise. During the mobilisation, some soldiers started a mutiny and set fire to the camp at night and caused panic. Zhang Liao told his subordinates: &quot;Don&#x27;t make any move yet. There isn&#x27;t a single company whose members are all involved in the mutiny, so the mutineers must be trying to cause chaos and make everyone else join them.&quot; He ordered all the soldiers who were not involved in the mutiny to remain in their positions and sit down, and then led his personal guards to the main command post to restore order. The leaders of the mutiny were identified and executed.

During the Battle of Red Cliffs, Zhang Liao were stationed in Changsha In 209, after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Chen Lan (陳蘭) and Mei Cheng (梅成) started a rebellion in Lu County (六縣; in present-day Lu&#x27;an, Anhui). Cao Cao sent two separate forces to suppress the rebellion: Yu Jin and Zang Ba to attack Mei Cheng; Zhang Liao, with Zhang He and Niu Gai (牛蓋) as his deputies, to attack Chen Lan. Mei Cheng pretended to surrender to Yu Jin, and then led his men to join Chen Lan at Mount Tianzhu as soon as Yu Jin and Zang Ba left. The paths leading up the mountain were narrow and dangerous to travel on.

When Zhang Liao wanted to attack the rebels, his subordinates advised him against it because of the hazardous terrain. However, Zhang Liao said: &quot;This is where one-to-one fighting will take place. Only the courageous can advance forward.&quot; He then ordered his troops to make camp at the foot of the mountain. They attacked the rebels later, defeated them, and killed Chen Lan and Mei Cheng.

When Cao Cao was assessing the respective contributions of his generals in the campaign, he said, &quot;The General Who Defeats Bandits (Zhang Liao) was the one who ascended the mountain, travelled through hazardous terrain, and defeated Chen Lan and Mei Cheng.&quot; As rewards for his success, Zhang Liao was granted acting imperial authority and given additional taxable households in his marquisate.

===Battle of Xiaoyao Ford and aftermath===
When Cao Cao retreated after being defeated by Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209, he left behind Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian with about 7,000 troops to guard Hefei from attacks by Sun Quan.

Around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote &quot;Open when the enemy comes&quot; on the envelope.

Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read: &quot;If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle.&quot; They were confused after reading the letter.

Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian: &quot;Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we are already done for. So he is actually instructing us to take advantage of the situation – when the enemy has just arrived and isn&#x27;t fully gathered yet – to attack them and devastate their morale so we can calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the two of you still hesitating?&quot; The three generals then worked together and recruited over 800 elite soldiers that night and prepared for battle the following day.

At dawn, Zhang Liao donned his armour, carried a &quot;ji&quot;, and led his men to attack the enemy formation. He killed tens of enemy soldiers and two officers, shouted his own name, and broke through the barriers until he reached Sun Quan&#x27;s command post. Sun Quan was shocked and his subordinates were all unsure of what to do. He then went to the top of a knoll, armed himself with a long &quot;ji&quot;, and stood there. He did not dare to move when Zhang Liao challenged him to come down and fight him.

When Sun Quan saw that Zhang Liao did not have many soldiers left with him, he ordered his forces to surround Zhang and his men. However, Zhang Liao fought fiercely and succeeded in breaking out of the encirclement with a few of his men. His remaining men, who were still trapped by the enemy, shouted: &quot;General, are you abandoning us?&quot; Zhang Liao then turned back and fought his way into the encirclement and succeeded in rescuing his remaining men.

Sun Quan and his men were all stunned by Zhang Liao&#x27;s valour and did not dare to stand in his way. The skirmish lasted from dawn to the afternoon, and the morale of Sun Quan&#x27;s army had fallen significantly. Zhang Liao returned to Hefei fortress and strengthened his defences. The defenders felt much more at ease and were very impressed with him.

Sun Quan was unable to conquer Hefei after several days so he withdrew his forces. While Sun Quan was retreating, Zhang Liao suddenly launched a surprise attack and inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津). He came very close to capturing Sun Quan a few times during the battle. Cao Cao was very impressed with Zhang Liao and promoted him to General Who Attacks the East (征東將軍).

In 217, when Cao Cao launched another campaign against Sun Quan, he passed by Hefei along the way, visited the site of the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, and spent a long time in reflection at the location. He increased the number of troops under Zhang Liao&#x27;s command and then relocated Zhang&#x27;s unit to a garrison at Juchao (居巢; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui).

===Battle of Fancheng===
In 219, when Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren was being besieged at Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei) by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, Cao Cao was away at the Hanzhong Campaign so he ordered his generals to lead troops from their respective garrisons to reinforce Cao Ren.

Around the time, Sun Quan had pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, so Zhang Liao was able to lead his forces from Juchao to help Cao Ren. However, before Zhang Liao reached Fan, Cao Cao&#x27;s general Xu Huang had already defeated Guan Yu and lifted the siege on Fancheng.

Zhang Liao rendezvoused with Cao Cao, who had returned after being defeated in the Hanzhong Campaign, at Mobei (摩陂; in present-day Jia County, Henan). Cao Cao rode in a carriage and went out to personally receive Zhang Liao. He then relocated Zhang Liao to the garrison at Chen Commandery (陳郡; around present-day Zhoukou, Henan).

==Service under Cao Pi==
Cao Cao died in early 220 and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi as the King of Wei (魏王). Cao Pi promoted Zhang Liao to General of the Vanguard (前將軍) and awarded him with 1,000 rolls of silk and 10,000 &quot;hu&quot; of grain.

When Sun Quan renounced his allegiance to Wei, Cao Pi ordered Zhang Liao to garrison at Hefei again to guard against possible attacks from Wu, and increased his marquis rank to Marquis of a Chief District (都鄉侯). Cao Pi also gave Zhang Liao&#x27;s mother a carriage, sent soldiers to serve as guards in Zhang Liao&#x27;s residence, and invited Zhang Liao&#x27;s mother to visit Luoyang. When Zhang Liao&#x27;s mother arrived, Cao Pi went out of the city and received her. All the officials who were there lined the path and paid respect to her.

In late 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, Cao Pi promoted Zhang Liao from a district marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Jinyang&quot; (晉陽侯) and increased the number of taxable households in his marquisate to 2,600.

In 221, Zhang Liao travelled to the palace in Luoyang for an audience with Cao Pi, who brought him to a newly constructed hall and asked him for his opinion on how to conquer Wu. Cao Pi compared Zhang Liao to Shao Hu (召虎). He also had a new mansion constructed for Zhang Liao and invited Zhang Liao&#x27;s mother to live there. All the foot soldiers who accompanied Zhang Liao in the battles against Wu were reassigned to the &quot;huben&quot; (虎賁; &quot;rapid as tigers&quot;) unit of the Imperial Guards.

In 221, after Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Wei again, Cao Pi reassigned Zhang Liao from Hefei to the garrison at Yongqiu (雍丘; present-day Qi County, Henan), where Zhang Liao fell sick. When Cao Pi learnt that Zhang Liao was ill, he sent Liu Ye to visit Zhang Liao and bring along an imperial physician to treat him. He also ordered the &quot;huben&quot; guards to serve as messengers to constantly update him on Zhang Liao&#x27;s condition – to the point where these messengers frequently encountered each other along the way while they were travelling between Cao Pi and Zhang Liao&#x27;s locations. Later on, before Zhang Liao had recovered, Cao Pi visited him, held his hand, gave him an imperial robe as a gift, and ordered his servants to prepare imperial cuisine for Zhang Liao. Zhang Liao returned to the garrison after his condition improved significantly.

===Death===


In 222, after Sun Quan broke ties with Wei and declared himself the independent ruler of his Eastern Wu state, Cao Pi ordered Zhang Liao and Cao Xiu to lead a naval fleet to Hailing (海陵; around present-day Taizhou, Jiangsu), directly facing Wu territory across the river.

Sun Quan was afraid when he heard that Zhang Liao was there, and he warned his generals: &quot;Zhang Liao may be ill, but he is still a foe to be reckoned with. Be careful!&quot;

Zhang Liao and the other Wei generals initially defeated the Wu forces led by Lü Fan, but the battle eventually turned in favor of the Wu forces, and the Wei forces withdrew. Afterward, however, his condition worsened, and he died not long later in Jiangdu (江都; present-day Jiangdu District, Yangzhou, Jiangsu).

Cao Pi cried when he learnt of Zhang Liao&#x27;s death. He awarded Zhang Liao the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Gang&quot; (剛侯), which literally means &quot;resolute marquis&quot;. In 225, in commemoration of Zhang Liao and Li Dian for their contributions at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 214–215, Cao Pi issued an imperial decree: &quot;During the Battle of Hefei, Zhang Liao and Li Dian defeated an enemy force of 100,000 with only 800 foot soldiers. There had never been anything like this before in the history of warfare. They can be referred to as our state&#x27;s &#x27;claws and teeth&#x27; for their success in breaking the enemy&#x27;s morale. I hereby increase the number of taxable households in Zhang Liao and Li Dian&#x27;s marquisates by 100 each, and award a son of each of them the title of a Secondary Marquis.&quot;

==Family==
Zhang Liao had an elder brother, Zhang Fan (張汎), who was awarded the title of a marquis in 220 before Cao Pi ended the Han dynasty. Zhang Liao&#x27;s son, Zhang Hu (張虎), succeeded his father as the next Marquis of Jinyang and held the rank of a Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) in Wei. After Zhang Hu died, his son, Zhang Tong (張統), inherited the peerage. Zhang Liao probably had at least one other son apart from Zhang Hu, because that (unnamed) son of his who received the title of a Secondary Marquis (關內侯) in 225 per Cao Pi&#x27;s decree was most probably not Zhang Hu.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Zhang Liao is featured as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during Three Kingdoms period. While his fictionalised persona is generally similar to its historical counterpart, some fictitious elements were included in the novel to enhance his image as a loyal and righteous general.

<doc id="248384" wikidata="Q1736732" url="?curid=248384" title="Refractory period (physiology)">
<text>Refractoriness is the fundamental property of any object of autowave nature (especially excitable medium) not responding to stimuli, if the object stays in the specific &quot;refractory state&quot;. In common sense, refractory period is the characteristic recovery time, a period that is associated with the motion of the image point on the left branch of the isocline formula_1 (for more details, see also Reaction–diffusion and Parabolic partial differential equation).

In physiology, a refractory period is a period of time during which an organ or cell is incapable of repeating a particular action, or (more precisely) the amount of time it takes for an excitable membrane to be ready for a second stimulus once it returns to its resting state following an excitation. It most commonly refers to electrically excitable muscle cells or neurons. Absolute refractory period corresponds to depolarization and repolarization, whereas relative refractory period corresponds to hyperpolarization.

== Electrochemical usage ==

After initiation of an action potential, the refractory period is defined two ways:
The absolute refractory period coincides with nearly the entire duration of the action potential. In neurons, it is caused by the inactivation of the voltage-gated sodium channels that originally opened to depolarize the membrane. These channels remain inactivated until the membrane hyperpolarizes. The channels then close, de-inactivate, and regain their ability to open in response to stimulus.

The relative refractory period immediately follows the absolute. As voltage-gated potassium channels open to terminate the action potential by repolarizing the membrane, the potassium conductance of the membrane increases dramatically. K+ ions moving out of the cell bring the membrane potential closer to the equilibrium potential for potassium. This causes brief hyperpolarization of the membrane, that is, the membrane potential becomes transiently more negative than the normal resting potential. Until the potassium conductance returns to the resting value, a greater stimulus will be required to reach the initiation threshold for a second depolarization. The return to the equilibrium resting potential marks the end of the relative refractory period.

== Cardiac refractory period ==
The &quot;refractory period&quot; in cardiac physiology is related to the ion currents that, in cardiac cells as in nerve cells, flow into and out of the cell freely. The flow of ions translates into a change in the voltage of the inside of the cell relative to the extracellular space. As in nerve cells, this characteristic change in voltage is referred to as an action potential. Unlike that in nerve cells, the cardiac action potential duration is closer to 100 ms (with variations depending on cell type, autonomic tone, etc.). After an action potential initiates, the cardiac cell is unable to initiate another action potential for some duration of time (which is slightly shorter than the &quot;true&quot; action potential duration). This period of time is referred to as the refractory period, which is 250ms in duration and helps to protect the heart.

In the classical sense, the cardiac refractory period is separated into an absolute refractory period and a relative refractory period. During the absolute refractory period, a new action potential cannot be elicited. During the relative refractory period, a new action potential can be elicited under the correct circumstances.

The cardiac refractory period can result in different forms of &quot;re-entry&quot;, which are a cause of tachycardia. Vortices of excitation in the myocardium (autowave vortices) are a form of &quot;re-entry&quot;. Such vortices can be a mechanism of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, the autowave reverberator, more commonly referred to as spiral waves or rotors, can be found within the atria and may be a cause of atrial fibrillation.

== Neuronal refractory period ==
The refractory period in a neuron occurs after an action potential and generally lasts one millisecond. An action potential consists of three phases.

Phase one is depolarization. During depolarization, voltage-gated sodium ion channels open, increasing the neuron&#x27;s membrane conductance for sodium ions and depolarizing the cell&#x27;s membrane potential (from typically -70 mV toward a positive potential). In other words, the membrane is made less negative. After the potential reaches the activation threshold (-55 mV), the depolarization is actively driven by the neuron and overshoots the equilibrium potential of an activated membrane (+30 mV).

Phase two is repolarization. During repolarization, voltage-gated sodium ion channels inactivate (different from the closed state) due to the now-depolarized membrane, and voltage-gated potassium channels activate (open). Both the inactivation of the sodium ion channels and the opening of the potassium ion channels act to repolarize the cell&#x27;s membrane potential back to its resting membrane potential.

When the cell&#x27;s membrane voltage overshoots its resting membrane potential (near -60 mV), the cell enters a phase of hyperpolarization. This is due to a larger-than-resting potassium conductance across the cell membrane. This potassium conductance eventually drops and the cell returns to its resting membrane potential.

Recent research has shown that neuronal refractory periods can exceed 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the relation between hyperpolarization and the neuronal refractory was questioned, as neuronal refractory periods were observed for neurons that do not exhibit hyperpolarization. The neuronal refractory period was shown to be dependent on the origin of the input signal to the neuron, as well as the preceding spiking activity of the neuron.

The refractory periods are due to the inactivation property of voltage-gated sodium channels and the lag of potassium channels in closing. Voltage-gated sodium channels have two gating mechanisms, the activation mechanism that opens the channel with depolarization and the inactivation mechanism that closes the channel with repolarization. While the channel is in the inactive state, it will not open in response to depolarization. The period when the majority of sodium channels remain in the inactive state is the absolute refractory period. After this period, there are enough voltage-activated sodium channels in the closed (active) state to respond to depolarization. However, voltage-gated potassium channels that opened in response to repolarization do not close as quickly as voltage-gated sodium channels; to return to the active closed state. During this time, the extra potassium conductance means that the membrane is at a higher threshold and will require a greater stimulus to cause action potentials to fire. In other words, because the membrane potential inside the axon becomes increasingly negative relative to the outside of the membrane, a stronger stimulus will be required to reach the threshold voltage, and thus, initiate another action potential. This period is the relative refractory period.

== Skeletal muscle refractory period==
The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2–4 ms and the absolute refractory period is roughly 1–3 ms, shorter than other cells.

<doc id="248388" wikidata="Q4838786" url="?curid=248388" title="Bachelor of Commerce">
<text>A Bachelor of Commerce (BCom or B Com) is an undergraduate degree in commerce, accounting, mathematics, economics, and management-related subjects.
The degree is mainly offered in Commonwealth nations.

==Structure==
===Bachelor of Commerce===
The Bachelor of Commerce degree is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business;
 see aside listing. For a comparison with other business degrees, see .

Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their major, students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, economics, business management, human resources and marketing. Programs often require foundational courses in business statistics and mathematics, and information systems. 

Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

===Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)===
The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (HonsBCom or BComm (Hons) or HBCom) is further advanced. 
The degree has a specialization aspect, analogous to the BBA, developing the student&#x27;s business skills and/or providing in-depth knowledge of the field.

It requires additional academic courses to be completed, and usually with higher academic performance standards, and may also require a researched thesis component. 
It often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs, including the Master of Commerce (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees.

It may consist of a four-year program or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year Bachelor&#x27;s degree; 
the one-year program is typically focused exclusively on a single subject-area.

===Duration===
The curriculum generally lasts three years in Australia, New Zealand, Malta, South Africa, some parts of Canada, and Hong Kong. The curriculum requires four years of study in India, Ireland, the majority of Canada, Egypt, Ghana, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

In South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and some universities in India, the BCom (Hons) degree is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification.

In Pakistan, BCom is generally a 2-year duration degree, whereas BS Commerce, formerly known as BCom (Hons) in the country, is a 4-year duration degree.

==History==
The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the University of Birmingham. The University&#x27;s School of Commerce was founded by William Ashley, an Englishman from Oxford University, who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Toronto. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at Harvard University, and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce. Ashley began the programme which was the forerunner of many other BCom degree programmes throughout the British Empire.

Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transport, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham programme in commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

<text>A Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS or BASc) is an undergraduate academic degree of applied sciences.

==Usage==

In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) is equivalent to the Bachelor of Engineering, and is classified as a professional degree. In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree. In the United States, it is also considered a highly specialized professional technical degree; the Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) is an applied baccalaureate, typically containing advanced technical education in sciences combined with liberal arts education that traditional degrees do not have. Yet, an earned BAS degree includes the same amount of required coursework as traditional bachelor&#x27;s degree programs.

The BAS degree is designed to develop both theoretical and pragmatic knowledge (Bachelors Portal, n.d.). Compared to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BS), a BAS degree combines “theoretical and hands-on knowledge and skills that build on a variety of educational backgrounds” (Edmunds College, n.d.). BAS degrees often enhance occupational/technical education.

In February 2009, the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Ronald Plasterk, proposed to replace all the existing degrees offered by Dutch vocational universities, such as the BBA, BEd and BEng, with the BAA and the BASc. Similarly, the United States has taken BAS as an official degree name.

==Fields of study==

The BAS usually requires a student to take a majority of their courses in the applied sciences, specializing in a specific area such as the following:

* Agricultural systems
* Applied physics
* Applied mathematics

<text>Spider-Man, also known as Spider-Man: The Animated Series, is an American superhero animated television series based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. The series aired on the Fox Kids Network from November 19, 1994, to January 31, 1998, for a total of five seasons comprising 65 episodes, and ran reruns on Toon Disney&#x27;s Jetix block and on Disney XD. The series was produced by Marvel Films and animated by TMS-Kyokuichi.

The series finale was the first to introduce the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, also known as the &quot;Spider-Man Multiverse&quot;, which later inspired similar narratives in various Spider-Man comics, cartoons, and films in the early 21st century.

&quot;People&quot; magazine described the show as one of the best animated comic book adaptions of all time.

==Synopsis==
The series follows Peter Parker, a college student at Empire State University who struggles to balance his responsibilities as the costumed hero Spider-Man with the problems of his personal life. In addition to fighting crime, Peter must navigate his romantic affections for love interests Felicia Hardy and Mary Jane Watson; maintain his friendship with Harry Osborn; focus on his academic performance as Dr. Curt Connors&#x27; student; and help to support his Aunt May after the death of his Uncle Ben by working as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. The Bugle is owned by loudmouth publisher J. Jonah Jameson, who often uses Peter&#x27;s pictures of his alter-ego to discredit and carry out a smear campaign against Spider-Man. Peter&#x27;s peers at ESU include football star Flash Thompson, popular barista Liz Allan, scientific genius Debra Whitman, and research rival Michael Morbius.

As Spider-Man, Peter faces various supervillains that threaten New York City, including criminal masterminds such as the Kingpin and the Hobgoblin, scientific mishaps like Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin, and the extraterrestrial symbiotes Venom and Carnage. Spider-Man is occasionally aided in his fight against crime by other superheroes, including the X-Men, the Punisher, Blade, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Iron Man, Captain America, and the Fantastic Four.

===Adaptations===
A large number of storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as:

====Season 1====

==Production==
While Fox Kids&#x27; &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series was being produced by Saban, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was produced by the newly formed Marvel Films Animation; it was the only series that in-house studio produced, but was animated by TMS-Kyokuchi Corporation. For many years, the series was the second longest-running Marvel show created, after &quot;X-Men&quot;, as well as the longest-running series based on Spider-Man (until &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; surpassed its record in 2015).

The show was significantly affected by censorship. In some episodes, realistic guns were depicted, but only in flashbacks, such as the showing of guns being fired during a flashback about the Punisher&#x27;s origins where his wife was killed in the crossfire during a crime. Rules for the production of the show included no punching, throwing through glass, putting children in jeopardy or vampires as well as no usage of the word sinister. In November 2014 podcasts, Semper clarified that the show was not censored more than any other show at the time and that every time this has been brought up to him, he feels it has been blown out of proportion; Semper said that Marvel had no creative control on the TV series because Marvel at the time was in a tough time and close to bankruptcy. In addition, Semper stated that Stan Lee had influence on the show in the first thirteen episodes.

The series is currently owned and distributed by The Walt Disney Company (Marvel&#x27;s parent company), which acquired all Fox Kids-related properties from News Corporation and Saban International in 2001.

===Writing staff===
Producer John Semper was the primary credited writer on the show, receiving some sort of writing credit (usually a story, co-story or co-writing credit) on 60 of the 65 produced episodes. He wrote 8 episodes solo; many of his story credits were actually adaptations of previously published comic book stories.

Mark Hoffmeier was a frequent contributor, receiving credits on 16 episodes, while Stan Berkowitz was credited on 9.

Many of the other series writers had previously worked on &quot;&quot;, including Brynne Stephens, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, Marty Isenberg and Robert N. Skir, Len Wein, and Sean Catherine Derek.

Semper watched previous &quot;Spider-Man&quot; adaptations for inspiration, but he was not impressed by most of them. The only previous adaptation that impressed him was the live-action &quot;Japanese Spider-Man&quot; (1978), which he thought was a &quot;great&quot; show and &quot;goofy fun&quot;. Japanese Spider-Man&#x27;s giant mecha robot influenced the final multi-part parallel universe arc where Spider-Man&#x27;s wealthy alter-ego has a robot.

===Animation===

To reproduce New York City&#x27;s appearance, background illustrators undertook a large amount of visual research by using photo archives from above New York, particularly rooftops. Maps were consulted for references and buildings were faithfully reproduced.

The animation cels depicting Manhattan&#x27;s Pan Am Building (recently renamed the MetLife Building) were scrapped after being complete because the California-based art staff learned the Midtown landmark had been given a new sign more than a year earlier.

The animation staff were directed to populate the city with cars and crowds on the street level. Semper believed that was one of the limitations of earlier Spider-Man animated projects.

Originally, Marvel Films planned to make the backgrounds completely CGI while Spider-Man swung around New York, yet due to budget constraints were forced to use traditional cel based animation while occasionally using CGI backgrounds by video game developer Kronos Digital Entertainment.

Reuse of animation became more common as the series progressed, which also included reuse of animation involving a character speaking (these scenes were sometimes slowed down in order to better match the actor&#x27;s voice to the animation).

===Music===
Marvel outsourced the show&#x27;s music to distributors Saban Entertainment, who were also responsible for the music in the concurrent &quot;X-Men&quot; cartoon airing on Fox Kids. The theme for the series was performed by Joe Perry of the hard rock band Aerosmith, although the song was written by Shuki Levy. Levy, Haim Saban and Udi Harpaz are credited as composers of the orchestral background score. The music was conducted with a live orchestra in Israel.

===Awards===
Writer and producer John Semper Jr. was nominated for an Annie Award in 1995 for Best Individual Achievement for Writing in the Field of Animation for the episode &quot;Day of the Chameleon&quot;. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was also nominated for one 1996 Image Award for Outstanding Animated/Live-Action/Dramatic Youth or Children&#x27;s Series/Special.

==Merchandising==
===Comics===
Similarly to &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, the series inspired a number of comic books. The first one was Spider-Man Adventures, published for 15 issues between December 1994 and February 1996, which loosely adapted the plot from the series&#x27; episodes. It was followed by Adventures of Spider-Man, a 12-issue series with original stories, published from April 1996 to March 1997.

Additionally, Marvel published a second series inspired by the animated series titled &quot;Spider-Man Magazine&quot;, that went on for 19 issues from March 1994 to March 1997. Two special issues were also published in 1995.

A tie-in series titled Marvel Adventures went on for 18 issues from April 1997 to September 1998.

Bibliography
* &quot;Spider-Man Adventures&quot; (December 1994 to February 1996): the first 13 issues each adapted one episode from the first season, and the last two issues were original stories. &quot;Spider-Man Adventures&quot; #1–4 was later reprinted in &quot;Kellogg&#x27;s Froot Loops Mini-Comics&quot; #1–4.
* &quot;The Adventures of Spider-Man&quot; (April 1996 to March 1997): featuring new stories based on the series. &quot;Adventures of Spider-Man&quot; was later reprinted in &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man (UK Magazine)&quot; #11–21 from August 1996 to May 1997.
* &quot;Marvel Adventures&quot; (April 1997 to September 1998): anthology featuring various animated versions of Marvel characters—Spider-Man only appeared sporadically.

===Video games===
A number of video games based on the series were also produced:
* &quot;Spider-Man Cartoon Maker&quot; for the PC (1995)
* &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1995) for the Super NES and Genesis

Electronic versions of classic Spider-Man comics were released by Marvel that included narration by Christopher Daniel Barnes and featured animation and theme music from this series. Spider-Man novels inspired by selected episodes were also released. A wide variety of themed merchandise (lunch boxes, cereals, clothing, etc.) was produced. McDonald&#x27;s produced a themed line of Happy Meal toys for the show.

===Release availability===
After the success of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, the series began to air in reruns through its new owners, The Walt Disney Company.

This show had been shown streaming entirety on Disney+ service since November 12, 2019.

==Home media==
===Region 1===
A single VHS volume containing the &quot;Hobgoblin&quot; two-part episode was released on July 2, 1997 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

From November 1996 until October 1999, Telegenic Entertainment released ten VHS volumes of the series in Canada. They were compilations that featured episodes edited into 70–80, 90-100 minute movies based on the particular story arc. The releases were &quot;The Venom Saga&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Goblins&quot;, &quot;Spider-Slayer&quot;, &quot;Insidious Six&quot;, &quot;Mutant Agenda&quot;, &quot;Tablet of Time&quot;, &quot;Neogenic Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Warriors&quot;, &quot;The Sins of the Fathers&quot; and &quot;Secret Ward&quot;. The tapes also contained bonus episodes of other Marvel cartoons.

From April 2002 until June 2005, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released several VHS and DVD compilations of the series. The first BVHE release - &quot;The Ultimate Villain Showdown&quot; contained episodes 2-5 of the &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; arc (Season 3) and special features such as a bonus episode from the 1967 series. &quot;The Return of the Green Goblin&quot; contains episodes 12-14 of the &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; arc and the first episode of the &quot;Partners in Danger&quot; arc (Season 4) with special features including the eighth episode of the arc, while the DVD also included a bonus episode from the 1967 series. &quot;Daredevil vs. Spider-Man&quot; contains episodes 6-9 of the &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; arc
with special features including a 1967 series episode featuring Kingpin while the DVD has a bonus episode from the second season of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; that guest stars Daredevil. &quot;Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock&quot; contained a Season One episode and episodes 2, 3 and 5 of the &quot;Partners in Danger&quot; arc, with a 1967 series episode as an extra. The fifth BVHE release - &quot;Spider-Man: The Venom Saga&quot;, contains the three-part &quot;The Alien Costume&quot; saga from Season 1 and Episodes 10-11 of &quot;The Sins of the Fathers&quot;.

A compilation release containing &quot;The Ultimate Villain Showdown&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Green Goblin&quot; and &quot;Daredevil vs. Spider-Man&quot; was also released.

===Region 2===
Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the compilations on VHS and DVD in the United Kingdom and select other territories. While the main content was the same, they contained different bonus features from the North American release.

In April 2008, Liberation Entertainment secured the home media rights to select Marvel shows from Jetix Europe in select European territories, including &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The company however shuttered their UK division at the end of October 2008, leaving releases of the show in limbo.

Clear Vision later took over rights in the UK, Sweden, and Germany and released the complete series in season sets. Season 1 on June 22, 2009, Season 2 on August 3, 2009, Season 3 on August 17, 2009, Season 4 on September 14, 2009 and Season 5 on October 19, 2009. The company followed this off with a complete series boxset released on November 11, 2011.

===Other releases===
* A Canadian DVD containing three episodes from the &quot;Mutant Agenda&quot; episodes. This is a reissue of the 1997 Marvel-New World/Telegenic VHS release (and it was mastered from one of those VHS releases); as a &quot;Bonus&quot; two episodes from the 1990s Iron Man TV series are included, just like on the VHS release. There are no audio/subtitle selections.
* Canadians also received another DVD release of the first season two-parter &quot;The Hobgoblin&quot;. This was a re-release of the 1997 VHS release from Fox Video; the video quality of the episodes on the DVD is that of a VHS transfer. There are no bonus features or audio/subtitle selections on this DVD either.
* A VCD release by Magnavision Home Video.
* A boxed set of all the DVDs was released in Poland, simply entitled &quot;Spider-Man: 5 DVD Set&quot;. The front of the box features the same graphics as &quot;The Ultimate Villain Showdown&quot;. DVDs including random assortments of episodes were also distributed with various magazines, ranging from entire story arcs to two or three episodes per DVD.
* Several two-episode DVDs were released by Marvel in 2002 prior to the acquisition by Disney.
* 3 DVDs with 2 episodes each were released regionally for Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia with Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian dubs on them in 2005.
* The entire first season was available on Xbox Live and iTunes through Disney XD.
* All five seasons are currently available for digital purchase on Vudu and Amazon.
* The entire series was available on Disney+ but was subsequently removed. Later on May 2 it made its return to the service. 
* There were also unlicensed DVDs that had The Adventure Continues on them that contained two episodes from most of the movies that were released by Marvel Films/New World Entertainment. For example, one was Spider-Man - Blade the Vampire Hunter which contained two episodes which were &quot;Blade, the Vampire Hunter&quot; and &quot;The Immortal Vampire&quot;, a two-part story episode from the second season, making it like a movie based on the toy line, Spider-Man: Vampire Wars.
* In France, all episodes were released on DVD from local Editor TF1 video, but only with French tracks voices and no subtitles available.

Bootleg DVDs of the show have become popular among fans due to a lack of official DVD releases. The bootlegs feature all of the episodes but some of them have low video quality and watermarks. This is likely to change as the entire series becomes available in the UK. The series is currently the 9th most wanted unreleased DVD at TVShowsOnDVD.com.

==Legacy==
===Spider-Verse===
The last two episodes of &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, about multiple &quot;Spider-Man&quot; characters crossing dimensions to different universes, was the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; story involving parallel universes. This inspired the Spider-Verse, which later appeared in various Spider-Man comics, cartoons and films in the early 21st century, with most notably the animated &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; feature films.

===Spiritual successor and possible revival===
On November 1, 2014 at the Comikaze Expo, where the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary was celebrated, John Semper Jr. revealed that much of the cast and crew of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, himself included, had agreed to reunite for a new crowdfunded series entitled &quot;War of the Rocket Men&quot;. In addition, in late 2014, Semper Jr started a website (cartoonspiderman.com) that features behind-the-scenes content, podcasts about the show, a link to the Facebook page that Semper regularly posts on and more. In April 2016, Semper&#x27;s YouTube account posted a video in which he revealed that he had written a short story following up on the series, detailing Peter finding Mary Jane with Madame Web&#x27;s help in a Victorian Age setting, referring to the story as &quot;an autobiographical fan-fiction&quot; in which he reminisced on what it was like writing the last episodes of the series, as well as detailing how Peter and Mary Jane would have been reunited, adding one could think of it as &quot;the lost episode of &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;&quot;. Semper explained that he would be releasing this as a perk on a crowd-funding campaign for &quot;War of the Rocket Men&quot;. The video also featured the returning voices of Christopher Daniel Barnes and Sara Ballantine as Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson respectively in an audio promo prologue entitled &quot;Peter Finds Mary Jane&quot;.

After &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; was announced as a revival of the &quot;X-Men&quot; TV series by Marvel Studios for the streaming service Disney+, it marked a possibility that &quot;Spider-Man&quot; could be revived for Disney+ as well. In July 2022, Semper addressed this, stating that he would happily do it if he had the same creative freedom he had on the series:
In February 2024, Sempers expressed interest that he would consider reviving the series on Disney+, if Marvel Studios Animation reaches out to him. Christopher Daniel Barnes also expressed interest in reprising his role as Spider-Man if asked. In March 2024, Brad Winderbaum later commented on the possibility of a revival for the series:
Spider-Man made a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; episode &quot;Tolerance is Extinction – Part 1&quot;, being among the witnesses to the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) wave sent out across the world by Magneto. He appears again in the season finale, &quot;Tolerance is Extinction – Part 3&quot;, this time as Peter Parker, as he, Mary Jane, and Flash watch Asteroid M hurdle towards Earth on a TV in the window of an electronics store. Series head writer Beau DeMayo later confirmed that the character is the same iteration from &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, and that he successfully rescued Mary Jane after the events of the series cliffhanger ending from season five. Christopher Daniel Barnes acknowledged the cameo, expressing interest in returning as Spider-Man in a potential revival, though no one has contacted him about it.

<doc id="248401" wikidata="Q1024091" url="?curid=248401" title="Huntsville, Ontario">
<text>Huntsville is a town in Muskoka district, Ontario. It is located north of Toronto and south of North Bay. Of the three major Muskoka towns (the others being Gravenhurst and Bracebridge), Huntsville has the largest population (21,147 per 2021 census) and land area ().

Huntsville is located in the hilly terrain of the Canadian Shield and is dotted with many lakes. Due to its natural environment and natural resources, Huntsville is a tourist destination that draws many people from around the world. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; ranked the town the #1 place to take a summer trip in 2011.

Huntsville serves as the western gateway to Algonquin Provincial Park via Ontario Highway 60 and was the host to the 36th G8 summit in June 2010, at Deerhurst Resort.

==History==

The first European who settled in the area in 1869 was George Hunt, who built a small agricultural centre. In 1870, a post office was built and the area was named Huntsville after Hunt, who became the first postmaster. Huntsville&#x27;s economic development was stimulated by the engineering of a navigable water route north from Port Sydney to Huntsville, which opened in 1877. A railway route from Gravenhurst was built by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway in 1885, which encouraged development and resulted in Huntsville becoming officially incorporated in 1886.

In the following year, the Muskoka Colonization Road reached this area. The central Ontario community became an important industrial area in the late 19th century and had several saw, planing, and shingle mills, as well as a tannery. Today, the many lakes and hills in the area, combined with the town&#x27;s proximity to both Algonquin Park and Toronto, make Huntsville and the Muskoka region a major tourist destination.

In June 2010, Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville was host to the 36th G8 summit.

===Empire Hotel===
On 8 October 2009, Huntsville lost one of its valued landmarks, the Empire Hotel. The first building erected at the site of the Empire Hotel was Jacob&#x27;s Hotel, built around 1875 by James W. Jacobs. He later renamed it Dominion Hotel. Jacobs died in 1890 and left behind his wife and eldest daughter, both of whom were named Emma. It is unknown which woman married a McLaughlin man, but the McLaughlin family renovated the building after the horrible Main Street fire of 1894.

The 26 July 1906 issue of the &quot;Huntsville Forester&quot; reported the sale of the hotel to Robert T. McNairney and D. Kehoe, who demolished it to expand it three stories. By 1922, the Dominion was owned by Bruce Simmons. Organized in 1933, the town&#x27;s rotary club began to meet at the hotel and would for many years. In 1945, the hotel was bought Louis Mascioli of Timmins. From 1947 to 1948, the Mascioli brothers renovated and expanded the facility, removing the porches, adding street level retail units, and erecting the adjoining four-story red brick building. They also renamed it the Empire Hotel. The first shops were a barbershop, a jewelry store, and a shoe store. Beilhartz shoes remained in business in the Empire Block until 1985.

In the mid-1980s, Jim Tumber, who acquired the building along with Gary Macklaim, obtained a grant from the Government of Ontario to help convert the now-derelict building from a hotel into an apartment building.

Dave Keay, the building&#x27;s last owner, bought the Empire in 1999. Over the next 10 years, he refurbished the basement bar and the 52 apartments and did most of the work personally. The fire happened on the day that Keay had just finished the outside painting.

The fire was believed to be caused by an electrical problem, but the exact cause is still unclear. As of March 2023, the lot is empty.

===Huntsville Town Hall===
Built in 1926, the Classical Revival administration building was designed by Toronto-based Ellis and Belfry (James Ellis and Franklin Belfry) and was last renovated in 2006 with an added annex (Algonquin Theatre). Council is exploring options to deal with the aging structure. The clock faces were salvaged on 17 August 1927 from the demolition of the 1873 Union Station in Toronto. The building&#x27;s land was once used as an early burial ground and Methodist manse for what was the Huntsville Methodist Church next door ( and became Huntsville Trinity United Church in 1926). During the construction of the town hall in the 1920s, skeletal remains were unearthed, which showed that not everything had been moved to the new Locks Cemetery site. The building involved two decades of planning.

==Council and administration==
The town&#x27;s council is made up of nine members. The members include the mayor, three town and district councillors who represent the town at the municipality of Muskoka council, and ward councillors who represent the wards of Huntsville (Ward 1), Chaffey (Ward 2), Stephenson-Stisted-Port Sydney (Wards 3, 4, 5), and Brunel (Ward 6). 
A regular council meeting is held once a month in the Council Chambers in the Huntsville Civic Centre.
From December 2019 to November 2022, the mayor of Huntsville was Karin Terziano. She had served as the acting mayor between 12 November 2019 and 17 December 2019. On 17 December 2019, Terziano was appointed to fill the vacancy of the mayor&#x27;s office because of Scott Aitchison&#x27;s resignation to become a federal MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

On 11 February 2019, Bob Stone was appointed to fill the vacant Ward One seat vacated when Mayor Terziano was appointed mayor.

On 24 February 2019, the council appointed Councillor Nancy Alcock to serve as Deputy Mayor. Alcock had previously served as the alternate deputy mayor. Councillor Jason FitzGerald was appointed alternate deputy mayor. 
Members of the 2018–2022 council term were:
* Deputy Mayor Nancy Alcock (Town and District Councillor)

* Jason FitzGerald (Stephenson-Stisted-Port Sydney, Ward 3, 4, 5)
* Dan Armour (Brunel Ward Councillor, Ward 6)
* Mayor Terziano

In early 2022, Mayor Terziano announced her intention to retire at the end of the term. Four individuals announced their bids to become mayor. Former Fire Chief Steve Hernen, incumbent Town and District Councillor Tim Withey, taxi stand owner Ruben Bullion and incumbent Deputy Mayor Nancy Alcock ran for the office. Deputy Mayor Alcock won the election. Hernen, Withey, and Bullion placed second, third, and fourth respectively. Nancy Alcock was sworn in as the second female mayor of Huntsville and the first elected female on 21 November 2022.

==Geography==
There are three large lakes within the township boundary: Mary Lake, Lake Vernon, and Fairy Lake, as well as countless smaller lakes. Peninsula Lake, Skeleton Lake, and Lake of Bays lie directly outside the town. The Muskoka River winds its way through the city&#x27;s downtown, and the Big East River empties into Lake Vernon. The Arrowhead Provincial Park is also located within city limits.

The Canadian Shield causes many scenic hills and sweeping landscapes throughout the region. The city centre is made up of hills and steep roadways. While there are some flat, low-lying areas, much of the city lies on uneven terrain.

==Climate==
Huntsville experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and cold winters. The town has four distinct seasons. Particularly during the colder weather season, there is considerable variance in day-to-day temperatures. Huntsville is located in the snowbelt region of Central Ontario, near the Great Lakes, causing snowy winters and lake-effect snow. The town has comfortable summer temperatures and occasional heatwaves accompanied by high humidity and active thunderstorm weather. Huntsville and the Muskoka region have the highest annual precipitation of any region in Ontario.

==Communities==
In addition to the city centre, the communities of Allensville, Ashworth, Aspdin, Britannia Road, Canal, Centurion, Etwell, Grassmere, Hidden Valley, Hoodstown, Ilfracombe, Lancelot, Martins, Melissa, Muskoka Lodge, Newholm, Norvern Shores, Parkersville, Port Sydney, Ravenscliffe, Stanleydale, Utterson, Vernon Shores, Williamsport, and Yearley are located within the municipal boundaries.

The ghost town of Emberson was a rural postal village from 1874 to 1924 serving near by bush farms and logging camps. Today, the area is covered over and reached by foot from the northern terminus of Brunel Sideroad 1.

==Demographics==

==Culture==
Huntsville is a home to many acclaimed visual artists. Famed Canadian artists such as Tom Thomson and his successors, the Group of Seven, painted frequently in Huntsville. The Group of Seven Outdoor Gallery has over 40 outdoor murals celebrating the work of these Canadian heroes. Local community visual arts group, The Huntsville Art Society, hosts many annual shows, exhibits, and skills-sharing workshops throughout the year.

Many summer camps for children such as Ontario Pioneer Camp, Camp Wabanaki, Camp Mini-Yo-We, Muskoka Woods, Camp Nagiwa, Camp Tawingo, and Olympia Sports Camp are within a few kilometers of Huntsville. Resorts such as Deerhurst Resort, where Shania Twain was discovered in 1988–1989, Hidden Valley Resort and Cedar Grove Lodge are located within the town&#x27;s boundaries.

Huntsville supports a number of arts festivals. The Huntsville Festival of the Arts provided a seed grant which funded a book of poetry entitled &quot;Fringe Festival Poetry, Poems from the Poetry Cafe&quot;, edited by June Salmon and Marta Mirecki-de Roode. Other local arts activities include the annual Muskoka Novel Marathon, started by Canadian authors Martin Avery and Mel Malton in 2001, the Film North – Huntsville International Film Festival which had its inaugural year in 2010, and most recently Nuit Blanche North, produced by the Huntsville Festival of the Arts and Edge of the Woods Theatre.

There are also many new arts organizations and associations. The Huntsville Art Society is a not-for-profit membership of local visual artists who opened an art gallery called The Art Space. Edge of the Woods Theatre presents artistic works by the community in Huntsville. They hold an annual traveling outdoor theatre event, as well as facilitate many different arts education projects for local seniors and youth within the community.

The Algonquin Theatre is a performing arts theatre, located within Huntsville&#x27;s municipal centre. The theatre provides space for local dance, music, and school activities. For profit venues are also scheduled, and most of the labour is provided by local volunteers.

Keith Bellows, editor in chief of &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; and vice-president of the National
Geographic Society, has included Huntsville and the Muskoka region in his book &quot;100 Places That Can Change Your Child&#x27;s Life&quot;.

==Education==
Public education for students from kindergarten through high school is administered through the Trillium Lakelands District School Board. It oversees the town&#x27;s single high school, Huntsville High School, and six elementary schools. A Primary Catholic school (Saint Mary Catholic Elementary School) is administered by the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board. There are several private schools that serve students through elementary and high school ages.

The Waterloo Summit Centre for the Environment, established with funding provided by the 2010 G8 Summit Legacy Fund as a partnership between the Town of Huntsville and the University of Waterloo. This facility was utilized by researchers and students of the University of Waterloo and the Northern Ontario School of Medicine. In 2017, the University of Waterloo terminated its lease with the Town of Huntsville, due to the distance between the centre and the university. The centre is permanently closed.

The Huntsville District Memorial Hospital is a community teaching hospital affiliated with the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (Lakehead University and Laurentian University).

==Economy==

Due to the influx of tourists during the summer months and the abundance of seasonal residents, Huntsville&#x27;s economy is primarily service based. There are also many people employed in construction trades. Although there is progress being made, Huntsville&#x27;s unemployment rate has long been above the provincial average. This is largely due to the seasonal nature of its tourism industry.

Major employers in Huntsville include Deerhurst Resort, Trillium Lakelands District School Board, and Kimberly Clark.

Main Street is home to various business and services for Huntsville. Reflections of Muskoka at 49E Main Street East was originally a Simpson-Sears retail location.

Huntsville Place Mall, on Main Street East, features retailers including The Source, Winners, Hallmark, Metro, Northern Reflections, Anthony&#x27;s Hair Design, Becker Shoes, Maurices, Scotiabank, Ron Henry Jewellers, Pearle Vision, Huntsville Place Mall Pharmacy, Sport Chek, Dollarama and the Habitat for Humanity Restore.

<doc id="248405" wikidata="Q378528" url="?curid=248405" title="Li Yu (Southern Tang)">
<text>Li Yu (; 937 – 15 August 978), before 961 known as Li Congjia (), also known as Li Houzhu (; literally &quot;Last Ruler Li&quot; or &quot;Last Lord Li&quot;) or Last Lord of Southern Tang (), was the third ruler of the Southern Tang dynasty of China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. He reigned from 961 until 976, when he was captured by the invading Northern Song dynasty armies which annexed his state.

Li Yu was sentenced to death by poisoning by Emperor Taizong of Song after 2 years as an exiled prisoner.

Li Yu was an incompetent ruler and poisoned Lin Renzhao and Pan You (潘佑) to death.

==Early life==
In the same Chinese year Li Congjia was born, his grandfather Xu Zhigao, also known as Xu Gao (Li Bian) founded the state Qi (), renaming it Tang (known as the Southern Tang) 2 years later. When Li Congjia was 6, his father Li Jing became the next Southern Tang emperor. With Li Jing naming his younger brother Li Jingsui his heir apparent, his sixth eldest son Li Congjia seemed unlikely to ever succeed the throne. However, many of Li Congjia&#x27;s brothers died very young, and after the death of the second eldest brother Li Hongmao () in 951, Li Congjia all of a sudden found himself right behind Li Hongji — the eldest brother — and uncle Li Jingsui in the succession line.

Li Hongji, a withdrawn and troubled young man, resented his crown prince uncle, whom he saw as a political enemy standing in his way. He also disliked his younger brother Li Congjia, even though they shared the same biological mother, Empress Zhong. Fearing the possible results of this family enmity, Li Congjia tried hard to be inconspicuous and focused on the arts, including poetry, painting and music. He loved reading, a passion encouraged by his father, also an acclaimed poet. At the age of 17, Li Congjia married Zhou Ehuang, chancellor Zhou Zong&#x27;s daughter and a year his senior. Lady Zhou was not only highly educated but also multi-talented in music and the arts and the young couple enjoyed a very intimate relationship.

==Accession to the throne==
In 955, a year after Li Congjia&#x27;s marriage, Southern Tang was invaded by Later Zhou. The resistance war did not end until spring 958, after Li Jing ceded all prefectures north of the Yangtze River to his powerful northern neighbor. Li Jing also relinquished all imperial trappings, degrading his own title from emperor to king (). The national humiliation was soon followed by familial tragedy: later that year Li Hongji poisoned uncle Li Jingsui to death, which was followed by his own death a few months later, allegedly hastened by many encounters with Li Jingsui&#x27;s vengeful ghost.

Not long after Li Hongji&#x27;s death in 959, Li Congjia was given the post of royal secretary () so that he could familiarize himself of governmental affairs. However, despite being the king&#x27;s eldest surviving son, a few ministers considered him too dissolute and weak for the crown prince position, including Zhong Mo, who pleaded to have Li Congjia&#x27;s younger brother Li Congshan chosen instead. Li Jing found Zhong&#x27;s suggestion offensive and demoted him.

Suffering from poor health, Li Jing decided to transfer all responsibilities to his successor. He named Li Congjia the crown prince in spring 961 to take over in the capital Jinling (; modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) while he retired to the southern city of Hongzhou (; modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). A few months later he died, and Li Congjia officially succeeded the throne, not without a last-second effort by Li Congshan to challenge him. By then Zhong Mo had also died, so Li Congshan asked chancellor Xu You to bring Li Jing&#x27;s last will to him. Xu refused and confided in Li Congjia of Li Congshan&#x27;s intentions. Li Congjia — changing his name to Li Yu — did not punish his younger brother other than a slight demotion.

==As Southern Tang ruler==

===Appeasing the Song Dynasty===
A year before Li Yu ascended the throne, Southern Tang&#x27;s nominal overlord Later Zhou had been replaced by the Song dynasty established by former Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin, who had earlier participated in several campaigns against Southern Tang. Knowing the limit of Southern Tang&#x27;s military strength and trying hard to be subservient to the northern court, Li Yu immediately sent a high official Feng Yanlu with a letter — whose language was of extreme humility — to inform Song of his succession. Things got to a rocky start: during his accession to the throne Li Yu built a golden rooster, a symbol of imperial power, the news of which infuriated Zhao Kuangyin. In the end, the Southern Tang ambassador in the Song capital of Bianliang (; modern Kaifeng, Henan) had to give the explanation that the golden rooster was actually a &quot;weird bird&quot; to satisfy the Song emperor.

Such an embarrassing relationship would define Li&#x27;s entire reign, as tribute payments, both regular and irregular, drained the Southern Tang treasury. Essentially Li was ready to fulfill Emperor Taizu of Song&#x27;s every demand except go to Bianliang himself. In 963, Li Congshan who accompanied a tributary mission was held hostage in Bianliang and had to write letters on behalf of the Song emperor asking his elder brother also join him at the Song court. Li Yu, naturally, did not heed the request.

===Successive deaths in the family===
Li Yu remained close to his wife Zhou Ehuang — Queen Zhou — so close that he sometimes canceled government meetings to enjoy her performances. The absences continued until a censor () spoke out against it.

In around 964, the second of the couple&#x27;s two sons, a three-year-old still called by his milk name Ruibao (), died unexpectedly. Li would mourn his son by himself so as not to sadden his wife more than necessary, but Queen Zhou was completely devastated and quickly deteriorated in health. During her illness, Li attended her and did not disrobe for days. When the queen finally succumbed to illness, Li mourned so bitterly until &quot;his bones stuck out and he could stand up only with the aid of a staff.&quot; In addition to several grieving poems, he chiseled the roughly 2000 characters of his &quot;Dirge for the Zhaohui Queen Zhou&quot; () — &quot;Zhaohui&quot; being her posthumous name — to her headstone himself. Part of the dirge read (as translated by Daniel Bryant):

Li Yu cheated on his wife while she was dying. During her last days he also engaged in a secret sexual relationship with Queen Zhou the Younger, the queen&#x27;s younger sister, who was only around 14 at that time. Worst of all, the queen discovered the &quot;affair&quot; which probably hastened her demise and multiplied Li Yu&#x27;s regret. A few months later, in late 965, disaster stroke again: Queen Dowager Zhong died after several months of attentive care-taking by Li. The subsequent mourning period delayed Li&#x27;s marriage to the younger Lady Zhou until 968.

===Deaths of Lin Renzhao and Pan You===
After conquering Jingnan, the Hunan region and Later Shu, the Song Dynasty army set off to invade Southern Han in 971, Southern Tang&#x27;s southwestern neighbor. Lin Renzhao, the Southern Tang military governor of Zhenhai Command () centering in Wuchang (in modern Hubei), believed the opportunity golden to attack the Song cities around Yangzhou (in modern Jiangsu) as the main Song army would be a long distance away and already severely fatigued. Li Yu immediately rejected Lin&#x27;s request: &quot;Stop the nonsense talks, (stop) destroying (our) country!&quot;

What Li was perhaps unaware was a year before, the Song military had gotten hold of an important chart with detailed measurements of Yangtze River crossing points, provided by a Southern Tang defector named Fan Ruoshui. After the conquest of Southern Han, their next step was to eliminate Lin Renzhao. In 974, Emperor Taizu of Song got hold of a Lin portrait through agents working in Southern Tang, and Li Congshan, the hostage kept in Bianliang, was then made to believe that Lin&#x27;s loyalty was with Song. When Li Yu was told of this, he without a thorough investigation secretly poisoned Lin to death. Chancellor Chen Qiao angrily reacted to Lin&#x27;s death: &quot;Seeing loyal ministers killed, I don&#x27;t know where I will die!&quot;

Li Yu also murdered Pan You (潘佑) by poisoning him.

===Fall of Southern Tang===

Li was an incompetent ruler who spent more time on literature and art, with little regard to the Song dynasty that was eyeing its weaker neighbor. In 971, Houzhu dropped the name of Tang from its Kingdom&#x27;s name, in a desperate move to please the mighty Emperor Taizu of Song.

Of the many other kingdoms surrounding the Southern Tang, only Wuyue to the east had yet to fall. The Southern Tang&#x27;s turn came in 974, when, after several refusals to summons to the Song court, on the excuse of illness, Song dynasty armies invaded. After a year long siege of the Southern Tang capital, modern Nanjing, Li Houzhu surrendered in 975. He and his family were taken as captives to the Song capital at present-day Kaifeng. In a later poem, Li wrote about the shame and regret he had on the day he was taken away from Jinling (as translated by Hsiung Ting):

==Death==
He was poisoned by the Song emperor Taizong in 978, after he had written a poem that, in a veiled manner, lamented the destruction of his empire and the rape of his second wife Empress Zhou the Younger by the Song emperor. After his death, he was posthumously created the Prince of Wu ().

==Writing==
Li was interested in &quot;cí&quot; poetry, which sometimes seems to characterize poetry of the Song Dynasty. However, he is not a Song poet: the Southern Tang is more a successor of Tang and precursor of the Song side that existed during the Tang-Song transition, also known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Li Yu represents both a continuation of the Tang poetry tradition, as well as representing the &quot;cí&quot; poetic style associated with the poetry of Song.

Li Houzhu devoted much of his time to pleasure-making and literature, and this is reflected in his early poems. A second phase of Li&#x27;s &quot;cí&quot; poems seems to have been the development of an even sadder style after the death of his wife, in 964. His saddest, poems were composed during the years of his captivity, after he formally abdicated his reign to the Song, in 975. He was created the Marquess of Disobeyed Edicts (), a token title only. Actually, he was a prisoner, though with the outward accoutrements of a prince. Li&#x27;s works from this period dwell on his regret for the lost kingdom and the pleasures it had brought him.

He developed the ci by broadening its scope from love to history and philosophy, particularly in his later works. He also introduced the two stanza form, and made use of contrasts between longer lines of nine characters and shorter ones of three and five. Only 45 of his &quot;ci&quot; poems survive, thirty of which have been verified to be his authentic works, the other of which are possibly composed by other writers. Also, seventeen shi style poems remain to his credit. His story is the subject of Cantonese operas.

===&quot;Cí&quot; poetry===

The roughly 40 (some of which incomplete owing to damaged manuscripts) &quot;cí&quot; poems possibly written by Li Yu are summarized in the table below. The &quot;cí&quot; as a poetic form follows set patterns or tunes ().

A few poems have been set to music in modern times, most notably the three songs in Teresa Teng&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Light Exquisite Feelings&quot;. Some of the songs are mentioned below.

====Poetry Examples====
Poems like these are often invoked in later periods of strife and confusion by literary figures.

&quot;Alone Up the Western Tower&quot; ()

&quot;Alone Up the Western Tower&quot; was written after his capture. Here the poem is translated by Chan Hong-mo:

This was also rendered into a song by Teresa Teng.

&quot;Jiangnan Remembrance&quot; (望江南), second stanza

===&quot;Shi&quot; poetry===

Li Yu&#x27;s poems in the form of &quot;shi&quot; include:
* &quot;Bìng Qǐ Tí Shān Shě Bì&quot; (; &quot;Getting up while Ill: Written Upon the Wall of My Mountain Lodge&quot;)
* &quot;Bìng Zhōng Gǎn Huái&quot; (; &quot;Feelings while Ill&quot;)
* &quot;Bìng Zhōng Shū Shì&quot; (; &quot;Written while Ill&quot;)
* &quot;Dào Shī&quot; (; &quot;Poem of Mourning&quot;)
* &quot;Dù Zhōng Jiāng Wàng Shí Chéng Qì Xià&quot; (; &quot;Gazing at Stone City from Mid-River and Weeping&quot;)
* &quot;Gǎn Huái&quot; (; &quot;My Feelings&quot;) — 2 poems
* &quot;Jiǔ Yuè Shí Rì Ǒu Shū&quot; (; &quot;Jotted Down on the Tenth Day of the Ninth Month&quot;)
* &quot;Méi Huā&quot; (; &quot;Plum Blossoms&quot;) — 2 poems
* &quot;Qiū Yīng&quot; (; &quot;Autumn Warbler&quot;)
* &quot;Shū Líng Yán Shǒu Jīn&quot; (; &quot;Written on the Napkin for a Sacrificial Banquet&quot;)
* &quot;Shū Pí Pá Bèi&quot; (; &quot;Written on the Back of a Pipa&quot;)
* &quot;Sòng Dèng Wáng Èr Shí Dì Cóng Yì Mù Xuān Chéng&quot; (; &quot;On Saying Farewell to My Younger Brother Chongyi, the Prince of Deng, Who is Going Away to Govern Xuancheng&quot;) — including a long letter
* &quot;Tí jīn lóu zi hòu&quot; (; &quot;Written at the end of the &quot;Jinlouzi&quot;&quot;) — including a preface
* &quot;Wǎn Chí&quot; (; &quot;Poem of Mourning&quot;) — 2 poems

&quot;To the Tune of Liǔ Zhī&quot; mentioned in the &quot;cí&quot; section may also be classified as a &quot;shi&quot;.

===Prose writing===
Li&#x27;s surviving prose are miscellaneous in character. For example, &quot;Dirge for the Zhaohui Queen Zhou&quot; is rhymed and almost entirely in regular four-character metre, resembling the &quot;fu&quot; form a millennium before.

===Calligraphy===

Li Yu&#x27;s calligraphy style has been dubbed &quot;Golden Inlaid Dagger&quot; () for its perceived force. As one Song Dynasty writer noted: &quot;The large characters are like split bamboo, the small ones like clusters of needles; altogether unlike anything done with a brush!&quot;

==Television series==
Three independent television series focused on the complex relationships between Li Yu (Li Houzhu), Emperor Taizu of Song (Zhao Kuangyin) and the various women in their lives. They are:
* &quot;The Sword and the Song&quot; (), a 1986 Singaporean series starring Li Wenhai as Li Yu.
* &quot;Love, Sword, Mountain &amp; River&quot; (), a 1996 Taiwanese series starring Chin Feng as Li Yu.
* &quot;Li Houzhu and Zhao Kuangyin&quot; (), a 2006 Chinese series starring Nicky Wu as Li Yu.

<doc id="248410" wikidata="Q2632935" url="?curid=248410" title="Minister of State">
<text>Minister of state is a designation for a government minister, with varying meanings in different jurisdictions. In a number of European countries, the title is given as an honorific conferring a higher rank, often bestowed upon senior ministers. In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries, &quot;minister of state&quot; is a junior rank subordinate to ministers of higher rank. In Brazil and Japan, all ministers of cabinet rank hold the title, while in Australia &quot;minister of state&quot; is the designation applied to all government ministers regardless of rank.

==High government ranks==
In several national traditions, the title &quot;Minister of State&quot; is reserved for government members of cabinet rank, often a formal distinction within it, or even its chief.
*Brazil: Minister of State () is the title borne by all members of the Federal Cabinet.
*Chile: Minister of State (Spanish: &quot;Ministro de Estado&quot;) is the title borne by all heads of the Ministries.
*France: Under the Fifth Republic, Minister of State (&quot;Ministre d&#x27;État&quot; in French) is an honorific title bestowed upon nomination as a Minister. Ministres d&#x27;État, in the protocol, rank after the Prime Minister and before the other Ministers but enjoy no other specific prerogatives. Initially, the title of Ministres d&#x27;État didn&#x27;t explicitly include a portfolio (a practice common under previous regimes), although in time both the title and a specific portfolio have since normally been conferred together. As under previous regimes, a series of Ministres d&#x27;État in the same cabinet may also reflect a balance between the different political trends in the ruling party (or within the ruling coalition). A Ministre d&#x27;État is not to be confused with a Secretary of State (&quot;Secrétaire d&#x27;État&quot;), a Junior minister assisting a Minister and who may only attend cabinet meeting if the topic discussed touches his responsibilities. Former Ministres d&#x27;État include former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
*Japan: Minister of State is the title borne by all members of the Japanese Cabinet.
*Kenya: A Minister of State generically refers to a more senior minister by virtue of the revenue power, or security implications of their ministry. For instance, ministries housed under the Office of the President, Office of the Deputy President and Office of the Prime Minister are titled as &quot;Ministries of State for&quot;. Actual examples include Ministry of State for Internal Security and Provincial Administration; Ministry of State for Immigration; and Ministry of State for Public Service.
*Luxembourg: Minister of State (French: &quot;Ministre d&#x27;État&quot;; Luxembourgish and German: &quot;Staatsminister&quot;) is an additional title borne by the Prime Minister. Unlike the title &#x27;Prime Minister&#x27; (French: &quot;Premier ministre&quot;; Luxembourgish: &quot;Premier&quot;; German: &quot;Premierminister&quot;), which was instituted only in 1989, that of &quot;Minister of State&quot; has been held by the head of government since 1848. As Minister of State, his role is to control and coordinate the activities of the other Ministers. 
*Monaco: The Minister of State of Monaco is the Principality&#x27;s head of government, appointed by and subordinate to the Prince of Monaco and responsible for enforcing its laws.
*Palau: The Minister of State of Palau is the minister responsible for foreign affairs and international trade.
*Portugal: Minister of State (&quot;Ministro de Estado&quot;) is a member of the Council of Ministers who holds a more distinct position within the cabinet, roughly equivalent to Deputy prime minister.
*Spain: When Adolfo Suárez was Prime Minister, Ministers of State were created who held a more distinct position within the Government. However, this initiative did not last since his successors did not follow this path.
*Scandinavian states + Finland: The equivalent title &quot;statsminister&quot; is used for the head of government (i.e. the prime minister), and compound titles of which &quot;-minister&quot; is a part may be used for major-portfolio Ministers. For details on &quot;statsminister&quot;, see Prime Minister of Sweden, Prime Minister of Denmark, Prime Minister of Norway, and Prime Minister of Finland.
*Turkey: A Minister of State () was a post in Turkish cabinets between 1946 and 2011. It was possible to have more than one Minister of State in a single cabinet, responsible for different policy areas.
*United Kingdom: Normally a mid-level government role (see next section) but Lord Beaverbrook was nominally Minister of State from 1 May 1941 to 29 June 1941 while a member of the war cabinet. It has become regular practice for senior Ministers of State to be invited to attend cabinet on a regular basis at the Prime Minister&#x27;s discretion, though they are not technically full members. However, more recently, some Ministers of State have been made full members of the Cabinet, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg when he served as Minister of State for Government Efficiency.

==Minor government ranks==
In various nations, especially in former members of the British Empire, &quot;Minister of State&quot; is a junior ministerial rank, often subordinated to a cabinet member.
*Canada: A Minister of State is senior to a Secretary of State but junior to a Minister of the Crown (ordinary portfolio minister). 

*Germany: Minister of State (&quot;Staatsminister&quot; in German) is the title given to a parliamentary state secretary (a member of parliament serving as a political aide to a cabinet minister) serving in the Foreign Office or the Chancellor&#x27;s Office. Accordingly, Minister of State ranks between a State Secretary and a Federal Minister. It is also used as the title of cabinet ministers of certain German states. Historically, the same title was used (sometimes alternating with other styles), notably as head of government in certain of the many constituent monarchies of pre-reunion Germany, e.g. in Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe, in Hannover, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Reuss-Schleiz-Gera and Principality of Reuss-Greiz, Kingdom of Saxony, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.

*India: A Minister of State is a junior minister in the Council of Ministers in the Union Government who may assist a cabinet minister or have independent charge of a ministry. The Constitution of India restricts the number of ministers of state in the federal government. A Minister of State with independent charge is a minister without an overseeing Cabinet Minister in the State or Union Government of India. He himself is in charge of his ministry, unlike Minister of State who is also a Minister but assists a cabinet minister. Moreover, such ministers can take part in cabinet meetings on important issues unlike Ministers of state who does not take any part in any cabinet meetings.
*Ireland: A Minister of State is junior to a Minister of a &quot;Department of State&quot; (portfolio minister) and of similar standing to a Parliamentary Secretary. 
*Nigeria: A Minister of State is a junior Minister in the Nigerian Cabinet and is normally the principal deputy or one of the deputies to the Minister in a Federal Ministry. The Minister of State may in some cases be the head of a special department in the President&#x27;s Office. By law, both senior Ministers and Ministers of State are regarded as Ministers of the Government of the Federation.
*Pakistan: Like in other former British colonies, a Minister of State in Pakistan is a junior Minister in the national Government who may assist a cabinet minister or have independent charge of a ministry.
*Sri Lanka: A Minister of State (or State Minister) is a non-cabinet minister of the executive branch of the Government of Sri Lanka, as such is junior to a Cabinet Minister but senior to a Deputy Minister.
*Singapore: Ministers of State and Senior Ministers of State are members of the executive branch of the Government of Singapore, senior in rank to Parliamentary Secretaries and Senior Parliamentary Secretaries, but junior to full Cabinet Ministers. 
*Turkmenistan: The chairperson of the government-owned national natural gas company, Turkmengas, holds the rank of Minister of State, and is included in the Cabinet of Ministers.

*United Kingdom: A Minister of State is a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Government, junior only to a Secretary of State but senior to a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Parliamentary Private Secretaries (PPSs). Ministers of State are responsible to their Secretaries of State. The role in this context has existed only since 1945 (see above for exception in the case of Beaverbrook) – previously, each parliamentary under-secretary was directly beneath a secretary of state. There can be more than one Minister of State at any government Department. Ministers of State may have departmental PPSs, or a PPS might be assigned to them. Of a similar standing to Ministers of State are positions such as the Solicitor General, the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Treasurer of the Household, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Paymaster General, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Ministers of State are bound by the Ministerial Code. 

==Subnational office==
In the republic of Burma, the title was used for the Chief ministers of the following autonomous states, from 1947/48 till the abolition of that autonomy in 1962: Arakan State (Rakhine), Chin State, Kayin State (Kayin), Kayah State (Karenni), Kachin State and Shan State

==Other uses==

===Australia===

*Australia: Section 64 of the Commonwealth constitution empowers the Governor-General to appoint &quot;the Queen&#x27;s Ministers of State for the Commonwealth [of Australia]&quot; as &quot;officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor‑General in Council may establish&quot;. The &quot;Ministers of State Act 1952&quot; defines the number of ministers only distinguishes between ministers and parliamentary secretaries (now known as assistant ministers). However, in practice ministers of state are divided into the Cabinet and the outer ministry. The only ministerial portfolio to have the term &quot;minister of state&quot; in the title is Special Minister of State.

===Netherlands and Belgium===

In the Netherlands (&quot;Minister van Staat&quot; in Dutch) and Belgium (also &quot;Ministre d&#x27;État&quot; in French), Ministers of State is a title of honour awarded formally by the Monarch, but on the initiative of the government. It is given on a personal basis, for life rather than for a specified period. The title is granted for exceptional merits, generally to senior politicians at the end of their party career. Ministers of state are often former cabinet members or party leaders. Ministers of State advise the Sovereign in delicate situations, with moral authority but without formal competence.

In Belgium they are entitled to a seat, alongside the members of the government in power, in the Crown Council; to date the Crown Council has been convened on only five occasions, the first being in 1870 for the Franco-Prussian War, and the latest in 1960 in connection with the independence of the Belgian Congo. Apart from that, the only privileges of being a &quot;minister of state&quot; are precedence according to protocol on state occasions and a ministerial car registration number. De facto, appointments tend to respect the almost obsessional balances between the Flemish and French-speaking communities as well as between the &#x27;ministeriable&#x27; political families: mainly Christian-democrats, Socialists, Liberals, also (moderate) Nationalists, occasionally an Ecologist). Other former careers include those of Étienne Davignon (European Commissioner) and Luc Coene (prime-ministerial Kabinetschef, roughly Chief of staff). In January 2006 the number of ministers of state reached 51 with Johan Vande Lanotte, shortly after he laid down his portfolio and title of Vice-Prime Minister to head the Flemish Socialist SP.A party. After formateur Yves Leterme returned his commission in August 2007, King Albert II consulted 13 Ministers of State individually, without convening the crown council as such.

In both countries, junior ministers are called State Secretary (&quot;staatssecretaris&quot; or &quot;secrétaire d&#x27;état&quot;), similarly to France. Some State Secretaries may, in specific circumstances, style themselves as Minister (not Minister of State) when visiting a foreign country.

===New Zealand===
* To bestow a sinecure — the role has been given to senior figures who did not occupy positions of leadership, but who were held in high esteem or who were wanted in Cabinet. For example, a former Prime Minister might be appointed Minister of State as an &quot;&quot; — this was the purpose for which New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon originally created the position in 1975.
* To create a sort of junior minister — using this office, politicians can be appointed to associate roles without having a substantive ministerial role of their own. There is no formal rank of &quot;assistant minister&quot; or &quot;deputy minister&quot; in New Zealand, but if someone is a full minister, they can be assigned to an associate role helping a different full minister. Someone appointed Minister of State is technically a full minister and can thus be assigned associate roles, thereby creating a type of minister whose only effective authority is as an associate minister.

The first Minister of State in New Zealand was Keith Holyoake, a former Prime Minister. Other prominent people to have held the office include Jim Bolger and Robin Gray (a former Prime Minister and a former Speaker, respectively). Examples of people who held the office simply in order that they might be appointed as associate ministers include Mita Ririnui, Damien O&#x27;Connor, and Dover Samuels.

===Ancien Régime France===
In France during the Ancien Régime and Bourbon Restoration, the title &quot;Ministre d&#x27;État&quot; had a specific designation. The title first appeared under Louis XIII. The &quot;ministres d&#x27;État&quot;, appointed by lettres patentes, attended meetings of the Conseil du Roi (which would later become the Conseil d&#x27;État). From 1661 on — at the start of Louis XIV&#x27;s &quot;personal reign&quot; — the king called whomever he wished to his Council; invitations were only good for one session and needed to be renewed as long as the individual retained the king&#x27;s confidence. However, having attended one session of the Council gave the person the right to be called &quot;ministre d&#x27;État&quot; for life, and also gave him the right to an annual life pension of roughly 20,000 livres. There were few &quot;ministres d&#x27;État&quot; at Council meetings (between three or four during the reign of Louis XIV); they also attended the &quot;Conseil des Dépêches&quot; (the &quot;Council of Messages&quot;, concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces).

Suppressed during the French Revolution, the title &quot;ministre d&#x27;État&quot; reappeared during the Bourbon Restoration as essentially an honorary title given (not systematically) to Ministers after their demission or their departure from office; refusal on behalf of the King to award this title to a demissioned Minister was seen as an affront.

===British diplomacy===
From 28 January 1944, the last two British Ministers Resident in the Middle East, concerned with former British protectorate Egypt, were styled Ministers of State in the Middle East.

<text>Bracebridge is a town and the seat of the District Municipality of Muskoka in Ontario, Canada.

The town was built around a waterfall on the Muskoka River in the centre of town and is known for its other nearby waterfalls (Wilson&#x27;s Falls, High Falls, etc.). It was first incorporated in 1875.

The town is the seat of the district government and a centre of tourism for the Muskoka area and has several historical sites, such as the Clock Tower, Woodchester Villa, and the Silver Bridge, which joins Manitoba Street with Ecclestone Drive. The Silver Bridge was repaired in 2002.

==History==
The character of the town of Bracebridge is shaped by its proximity to Lake Muskoka to which it is connected by of the Muskoka River, and by the promise of abundant water power afforded by the great waterfall at the foot of the downtown. Early growth of the town occurred in proximity to the falls which powered the first factory. The arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway cemented the town&#x27;s role as a transportation hub for the area.

Modern settlement of the town began in the 1860s, beginning at first with a few log huts. The Muskoka colonization road had been completed to the first falls on the north branch of the Muskoka River by 1862. Entrepreneurs began to take advantage of the area&#x27;s water power. With the advent of steamship service on Lake Muskoka a few years later, Bracebridge prospered as the main distribution centre for the region.

By 1869, Bracebridge was a village with a population of 160 in the Township of Macaulay, Victoria County. (In 1868 Macauley and six additional townships had been detached from the County and transferred to the new District of Muskoka, but were not withdrawn for municipal purposes until 1877.) The village was established on the Muskoka River. There were stages in winter and boats in summer from Barrie to Washago. The average price of wild land was $2 to $5 an acre while improved land was $10 per acre.
By 1870 the village had a population of about 400, growing to reach a total of about 2,000 by the turn of the 20th century. The village was incorporated in 1875 and became a town under an Act of Parliament in 1889. In 1894 Bracebridge became the first town in Ontario to have its own hydro generating station. In 1971 Macaulay Township was merged into Bracebridge.

The municipal boundaries of Bracebridge also encompass the smaller communities of Clear Lake, Falkenburg (ghost town), Falkenburg Station, Fraserburg, Germania, Lakewood, Matthiasville, Monsell (ghost town), Purbrook, Rocksborough, Springdale Park, Stoneleigh, Uffington and Vankoughnet.

==Transportation==
Bracebridge is immediately adjacent to Highway 11, a major provincial highway that connects the community to Greater Toronto in under 2 hours, as well as to markets in Northern Ontario. Muskoka Airport, which serves general aviation and scheduled flights from Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, is located 5 km south of Bracebridge.

While rail service to Bracebridge has been discontinued, the community is serviced by coach bus line Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services that departs from the Bracebridge Quality Inn and takes passengers south to Toronto and north to North Bay. In 2016, the municipality launched Bracebridge Transit, a one-hour single-route schedule that gets residents around the urban core. Bracebridge Mobility also offers door-to-door service to individuals who are unable to access the regular transit service due to mobility issues. The site of the Bracebridge station, with the waiting station, remains.

==Climate==
==Education==
Bracebridge is served by several elementary schools and two high schools: Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes Secondary School, and Saint Dominic Catholic Secondary School. Public education is administered by the Trillium Lakelands District School Board, and Catholic education is administered by the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board.

Georgian College operates a satellite campus in the town with programming that supports the local labour market. Nipissing University operated in Bracebridge for over 21 years but chose to consolidate its operations in 2016 resulting in the closure of the local campus. The facility was purchased in 2018 by a private institute.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bracebridge had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Sports==

The Town of Bracebridge built a Sportsplex in 2006 which contains a rock climbing wall, indoor track, eight-lane swimming pool and fitness studio. The town partnered with the Muskoka Limberettes Gymnastics Club to create a gymnastics facility in the same building. The Sportsplex is part of the same complex including the Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes Secondary School and Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre.

Bracebridge also opened a new 3.75 Million dollar softball venue called Peake Fields at Verena Acres. This facility supports a Men&#x27;s League, Women&#x27;s League, and Minor Ball, as well as slow pitch. The Men&#x27;s fastball League has been running for some 35 years, and has produced 4 Ontario Intermediate Fastball Championships, and 3 Canadian Championships, with all local players.

Plans are currently in place for a new Arena/Fieldhouse/Library complex that is now currently under construction with an expected opening of the facility in March 2023

==Attractions and venues==
Bracebridge is the home of Santa&#x27;s Village, a Christmas theme park, established in 1955. It was inspired by the town&#x27;s location at 45 degrees latitude, halfway between the equator and the North Pole. In 2016, Bracebridge held its first annual Fire and Ice Festival.

==Media==

===Newspapers===

Local newspapers include &quot;Bracebridge Examiner&quot;, &quot;District Weekender&quot;, &quot;Muskoka Sun&quot; and &quot;Muskoka Advance&quot;.

The first newspaper in Bracebridge was the &quot;Northern Advocate&quot; begun in 1870 by Thomas McMurray. It was joined in 1872 by the &quot;Free Grant Gazette&quot; owned by E.F. Stephenson. The &quot;Advocate&quot; ceased publication in 1874 and was bought out by Stephenson. Competition resumed, however, in 1878 when Mr Gaffe and Mr Oaten founded the &quot;Muskoka Herald&quot;.

<doc id="248413" wikidata="Q299208" url="?curid=248413" title="Sonny Rollins">
<text>Walter Theodore &quot;Sonny&quot; Rollins (born September 7, 1930) is an American retired jazz tenor saxophonist who is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. 

In a seven-decade career, Rollins recorded over sixty albums as a leader. A number of his compositions, including &quot;St. Thomas&quot;, &quot;Oleo&quot;, &quot;Doxy&quot;, and &quot;Airegin&quot;, have become jazz standards. Rollins has been called &quot;the greatest living improviser&quot;. Due to health problems, Rollins has not performed publicly since 2012 and announced his retirement in 2014.

==Early life==
Rollins was born in New York City to parents from the Virgin Islands. The youngest of three siblings, he grew up in central Harlem and on Sugar Hill, receiving his first alto saxophone at the age of seven or eight. He attended Edward W. Stitt Junior High School and graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. Rollins started as a pianist, then switched to alto saxophone after being inspired by Louis Jordan and finally switched to tenor saxophone in 1946, influenced by his idol Coleman Hawkins. During his high school years, he played in a band with other future jazz legends Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew, and Art Taylor.

==Later life and career==

===1949–1956===
After graduating from high school in 1948, Rollins began performing professionally; he made his first recordings in early 1949 as a sideman with the bebop singer Babs Gonzales (trombonist J. J. Johnson was the arranger of the group). Within the next few months, he began to make a name for himself, recording with Johnson and appearing under the leadership of pianist Bud Powell, alongside trumpeter Fats Navarro and drummer Roy Haynes, on a seminal &quot;hard bop&quot; session.

In early 1950, Rollins was arrested for armed robbery and spent ten months in Rikers Island jail before being released on parole; in 1952, he was re-arrested for violating the terms of his parole by using heroin. Between 1951 and 1953, he recorded with Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Charlie Parker, and Thelonious Monk. A breakthrough arrived in 1954 when he recorded his famous compositions &quot;Oleo&quot;, &quot;Airegin&quot;, and &quot;Doxy&quot; with a quintet led by Davis that also featured pianist Horace Silver, these recordings appearing on the album &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot;.

In 1955, Rollins entered the Federal Medical Center, Lexington. While there, he volunteered for then-experimental methadone therapy and was able to break his heroin habit, after which he lived for a time in Chicago, briefly rooming with the trumpeter Booker Little. Rollins initially feared sobriety would impair his musicianship, but then went on to greater success.

Rollins briefly joined the Miles Davis Quintet in the summer of 1955. Later that year, he joined the Clifford Brown–Max Roach quintet; studio albums documenting his time in the band are &quot;Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street&quot; and &quot;Sonny Rollins Plus 4&quot;. After the deaths of Brown and the band&#x27;s pianist, Richie Powell, in a June 1956 automobile accident, Rollins continued playing with Roach and began releasing albums under his own name on Prestige Records, Blue Note, Riverside, and the Los Angeles label Contemporary.

His widely acclaimed album &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot; was recorded on June 22, 1956, at Rudy Van Gelder&#x27;s studio in New Jersey, with Tommy Flanagan on piano, former Jazz Messengers bassist Doug Watkins, and his favorite drummer, Roach. This was Rollins&#x27;s sixth recording as a leader and it included his best-known composition &quot;St. Thomas&quot;, a Caribbean calypso based on &quot;Hold Him Joe&quot; a tune sung to him by his mother in his childhood, as well as the fast bebop number &quot;Strode Rode&quot;, and &quot;Moritat&quot; (the Kurt Weill composition also known as &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;). A long blues solo on &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;, &quot;Blue 7&quot;, was analyzed in depth by the composer and critic Gunther Schuller in a 1958 article.

In the solo for &quot;St. Thomas&quot;, Rollins uses repetition of a rhythmic pattern, and variations of that pattern, covering only a few tones in a tight range, and employing staccato and semi-detached notes. This is interrupted by a sudden flourish, utilizing a much wider range before returning to the former pattern. (Listen to the music sample.) In his book &quot;The Jazz Style of Sonny Rollins&quot;, David N. Baker explains that Rollins &quot;very often uses rhythm for its own sake. He will sometimes improvise on a rhythmic pattern instead of on the melody or changes.&quot;

Ever since recording &quot;St. Thomas&quot;, Rollins&#x27;s use of calypso rhythms has been one of his signature contributions to jazz; he often performs traditional Caribbean tunes such as &quot;Hold &#x27;Em Joe&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot;, and he has written many original calypso-influenced compositions, such as &quot;Duke of Iron&quot;, &quot;The Everywhere Calypso&quot;, and &quot;Global Warming&quot;.

In 1956, he recorded &quot;Tenor Madness&quot;, using Davis&#x27;s group – pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. The title track is the only recording of Rollins with John Coltrane, who was also a member of Davis&#x27;s group.

At the end of the year Rollins appeared as a sideman on Thelonious Monk&#x27;s album &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; and also recorded his own first album for Blue Note Records, entitled &quot;Sonny Rollins, Volume One&quot;, with Donald Byrd on trumpet, Wynton Kelly on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and Roach on drums.

===1957–spring 1959===
In 1957, he married his first wife, actress and model Dawn Finney.

That year, Rollins pioneered the use of bass and drums, without piano, as accompaniment for his saxophone solos, a texture that came to be known as &quot;strolling&quot;. Two early tenor/bass/drums trio recordings are &quot;Way Out West&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard&quot;, both recorded in 1957. &quot;Way Out West&quot; was so named because it was recorded for California-based Contemporary Records (with Los Angeles drummer Shelly Manne), and because it included country and western songs such as &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand&quot;. The Village Vanguard album consists of two sets, a matinee with bassist Donald Bailey and drummer Pete LaRoca and an evening set with bassist Wilbur Ware and drummer Elvin Jones. Rollins used the trio format intermittently throughout his career, sometimes taking the unusual step of using his sax as a rhythm section instrument during bass and drum solos. Lew Tabackin cited Rollins&#x27;s pianoless trio as an inspiration to lead his own. Joe Henderson, David S. Ware, Joe Lovano, Branford Marsalis, and Joshua Redman led pianoless sax trios.

While in Los Angeles in 1957, Rollins met alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman and the two of them practiced together. Coleman, a pioneer of free jazz, stopped using a pianist in his own band two years later. By this time, Rollins had become well-known for improvising based on relatively banal or unconventional songs (such as &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; on &quot;Work Time&quot;, &quot;Toot, Toot, Tootsie&quot; on &quot;The Sound of Sonny&quot;, and later &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; on the Grammy-winning album &quot;This Is What I Do&quot;).

Rollins acquired the nickname &quot;Newk&quot; because of his facial resemblance to Brooklyn Dodgers star pitcher Don Newcombe.

In 1957, he made his Carnegie Hall debut and recorded again for Blue Note with Johnson on trombone, Horace Silver or Monk on piano and drummer Art Blakey (released as &quot;Sonny Rollins, Volume Two&quot;). That December, he and fellow tenor saxophonist Sonny Stitt were featured together on Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s album &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot;. In 1958, he appeared in Art Kane&#x27;s &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot; photograph of jazz musicians in New York; he is the last surviving musician from the photo.

The same year, Rollins recorded another landmark piece for saxophone, bass and drums trio: &quot;Freedom Suite&quot;. His original sleeve notes said, &quot;How ironic that the Negro, who more than any other people can claim America&#x27;s culture as his own, is being persecuted and repressed; that the Negro, who has exemplified the humanities in his very existence, is being rewarded with inhumanity.&quot; The title track is a nineteen-minute improvised bluesy suite; the other side of the album features hard bop workouts of popular show tunes. Oscar Pettiford and Max Roach provided bass and drums, respectively. The LP was available only briefly in its original form, before the record company repackaged it as &quot;Shadow Waltz&quot;, the title of another piece on the record.

Following &quot;Sonny Rollins and the Big Brass&quot; (&quot;Sonny Rollins Brass/Sonny Rollins Trio&quot;), Rollins made one more studio album in 1958, &quot;Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders&quot;, before taking a three-year break from recording. This was a session for Contemporary Records and saw Rollins recording an esoteric mixture of tunes including &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot; with a West Coast group made up of pianist Hampton Hawes, guitarist Barney Kessel, bassist Leroy Vinnegar and drummer Shelly Manne.

In 1959 he toured Europe for the first time, performing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and France.

===Summer 1959–fall 1961: The Bridge===
By 1959, Rollins had become frustrated with what he perceived as his own musical limitations and took the first – and most famous – of his musical sabbaticals. While living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he ventured to the pedestrian walkway of the Williamsburg Bridge to practice, in order to avoid disturbing a neighboring expectant mother. Today, a fifteen-story apartment building named &quot;The Rollins&quot; stands on the Grand Street site where he lived. Almost every day from the summer of 1959 through the end of 1961, Rollins practiced on the bridge, next to the subway tracks. Rollins admitted that he would often practice for 15 or 16 hours a day, no matter what season. In the summer of 1961, the journalist Ralph Berton happened to pass by the saxophonist on the bridge one day and published an article in &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine about the occurrence. During this period, Rollins became a dedicated practitioner of yoga. Rollins ended his sabbatical in November 1961. He later said &quot;I could have probably spent the rest of my life just going up on the bridge. I realized, no, I have to get back into the real world.&quot; In 2016, a campaign was initiated that seeks to have the bridge renamed in Rollins&#x27;s honor.

===Winter 1961–1969: Musical explorations===
In November 1961, Rollins returned to the jazz scene with a residency at the Jazz Gallery in Greenwich Village; in March, 1962, he appeared on Ralph Gleason&#x27;s television series &quot;Jazz Casual&quot;. During the 1960s, he lived on Willoughby Street in Brooklyn, New York.

He named his 1962 &quot;comeback&quot; album &quot;The Bridge&quot; at the start of a contract with RCA Victor. Produced by George Avakian, the disc was recorded with a quartet featuring guitarist Jim Hall, Ben Riley on drums, and bassist Bob Cranshaw. This became one of Rollins&#x27;s best-selling records; in 2015 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Rollins&#x27;s contract with RCA Victor lasted through 1964. Each album he recorded differed radically from the previous one. The 1962 disc &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot; explored Latin rhythms. On the album &quot;Our Man in Jazz,&quot; recorded live at The Village Gate, he explored avant-garde playing with a quartet that featured Cranshaw on bass, Billy Higgins on drums and Don Cherry on cornet. He also played with a tenor saxophone hero, Coleman Hawkins, and free jazz pianist Paul Bley on &quot;Sonny Meets Hawk!&quot;, and he re-examined jazz standards and Great American Songbook melodies on &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; and &quot;The Standard Sonny Rollins&quot; (which featured pianist Herbie Hancock).

In 1963, he made the first of many tours of Japan.

In 1965, he married Lucille Pearson, born on July 25, 1928, in Kansas City, Missouri. She eventually became his very effective manager/producer. They moved (partially, then completely) from New York City to Germantown, New York, where she died November 27, 2004. 

In 2007, recordings from a 1965 residency at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club were released by the Harkit label as &quot;Live in London&quot;; they offer a very different picture of Rollins&#x27;s playing from the studio albums of the period. (These are unauthorized releases, and Rollins has responded by &quot;bootlegging&quot; them himself and releasing them on his website.)

Upon signing with Impulse! Records, he released a soundtrack to the 1966 film &quot;Alfie,&quot; as well as &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; and &quot;Sonny Rollins on Impulse!&quot; After &quot;East Broadway Run Down&quot; (1966), which featured trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones, Rollins did not release another studio album for six years.

In 1968, he was the subject of a television documentary (in the series Creative Persons), directed by Dick Fontaine, entitled &quot;Who is Sonny Rollins?&quot;

===1969–1971: Second sabbatical===

In 1969, Rollins took another two-year sabbatical from public performance. During this hiatus period, he visited Jamaica for the first time and spent several months studying yoga, meditation, and Eastern philosophies at an ashram in Powai, India, a district of Mumbai.

===1971–2000===
 He returned from his second sabbatical with a performance in Kongsberg, Norway, in 1971. Reviewing a March 1972 performance at New York&#x27;s Village Vanguard night club, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; critic Whitney Balliett wrote that Rollins &quot;had changed again. He had become a whirlwind. His runs roared, and there were jarring staccato passages and furious double-time spurts. He seemed to be shouting and gesticulating on his horn, as if he were waving his audience into battle.&quot; The same year, he released &quot;Next Album&quot; and moved to Germantown, New York. Also in 1972, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in composition.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he also became drawn to R&amp;B, pop, and funk rhythms. Some of his bands during this period featured electric guitar, electric bass, and usually more pop- or funk-oriented drummers.

In 1974, Rollins added jazz bagpiper Rufus Harley to his band; the group was filmed performing live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London. For most of this period Rollins was recorded by producer Orrin Keepnews for Milestone Records (the compilation &quot;Silver City: A Celebration of 25 Years on Milestone&quot; contains a selection from these years). In 1978 he, McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter, and Al Foster toured together as the Milestone Jazzstars. In June of that year he joined many other major jazz artists in a performance for President Jimmy Carter on the South Lawn of the White House.

It was also during this period that Rollins&#x27;s passion for unaccompanied saxophone solos came to the forefront. In 1979 he played unaccompanied on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and in 1985 he released &quot;The Solo Album&quot;, recorded live at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also frequently played long, extemporaneous unaccompanied cadenzas during performances with his band; a prime example is his introduction to the tune &quot;Autumn Nocturne&quot; on the 1978 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot;.

By the 1980s, Rollins had stopped playing small nightclubs and was appearing mainly in concert halls or outdoor arenas; through the late 1990s he occasionally performed at large New York rock clubs such as Tramps and The Bottom Line. He added (uncredited) sax improvisations to three tracks by the Rolling Stones for their 1981 album &quot;Tattoo You&quot;, including the single, &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; and the long jam &quot;Slave&quot;. That November, he led a saxophone masterclass on French television. In 1983, he was honored as a &quot;Jazz Master&quot; by the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 1986, documentary filmmaker Robert Mugge released a film titled &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;. It featured two Rollins performances: a quintet concert at Opus 40 in upstate New York and a performance with the Yomiuri Shimbun Orchestra in Japan of his &quot;Concerto for Saxophone and Symphony&quot;, a work composed in collaboration with the Finnish pianist and composer Heikki Sarmanto.

In 1993, the Sonny Rollins International Jazz Archives opened at the University of Pittsburgh.

New York City Hall proclaimed November 13, 1995, to be &quot;Sonny Rollins Day&quot;. Several days later, Rollins gave a performance at New York City&#x27;s Beacon Theatre that reunited him with musicians with whom he played as a teenager, including McLean, Walter Bishop Jr., Percy Heath, Connie Henry, and Gil Coggins.

In 1997, he was voted &quot;Jazz Artist of the Year&quot; in the &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine critics&#x27; poll. The following year, Rollins, a dedicated advocate of environmentalism, released an album entitled &quot;Global Warming&quot;.

===2001–2012===

Critics such as Gary Giddins and Stanley Crouch have noted the disparity between Rollins the recording artist, and Rollins the concert artist. In a May 2005 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile, Crouch wrote of Rollins the concert artist:

Rollins won a 2001 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for &quot;This Is What I Do&quot; (2000). On September 11, 2001, the 71-year-old Rollins, who lived several blocks away, heard the World Trade Center collapse, and was forced to evacuate his Greenwich Street apartment, with only his saxophone in hand. Although he was shaken, he traveled to Boston five days later to play a concert at the Berklee School of Music. The live recording of that performance was released on CD in 2005 as &quot;Without a Song: The 9/11 Concert&quot;, which won the 2006 Grammy for Jazz Instrumental Solo for Rollins&#x27;s performance of &quot;Why Was I Born?&quot;

Rollins was presented with a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2004; that year also saw the death of his wife, Lucille.

In 2006, Rollins went on to complete a Down Beat Readers Poll triple win for: &quot;Jazzman of the Year&quot;, &quot;#1 Tenor Sax Player&quot;, and &quot;Recording of the Year&quot; for the CD &quot;Without a Song: The 9/11 Concert&quot;. The band that year featured his nephew, trombonist Clifton Anderson, and included bassist Cranshaw, pianist Stephen Scott, percussionist Kimati Dinizulu, and drummer Perry Wilson.

After a successful Japanese tour Rollins returned to the recording studio for the first time in five years to record the Grammy-nominated CD &quot;Sonny, Please&quot; (2006). The CD title is derived from one of his wife&#x27;s favorite phrases. The album was released on Rollins&#x27;s own label, Doxy Records, following his departure from Milestone Records after many years and was produced by Anderson. Rollins&#x27;s band at this time, and on this album, included Cranshaw, guitarist Bobby Broom, drummer Steve Jordan and Dinizulu.

During these years, Rollins regularly toured worldwide, playing major venues throughout Europe, South America, the Far East, and Australasia; he is estimated to have sometimes earned as much as $100,000 per performance. On September 18, 2007, he performed at Carnegie Hall in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of his first performance there. Appearing with him were Anderson (trombone), Bobby Broom (guitar), Cranshaw (bass), Dinizulu (percussion), Roy Haynes (drums) and Christian McBride (bass).

Around 2000, Rollins began recording many of his live performances; since then, he has archived recordings of over two hundred and fifty concerts. To date, four albums have been released from these archives on Doxy Records and Okeh Records: &quot;Road Shows, Vol. 1&quot;; &quot;Road Shows, Vol. 2&quot; (with four tracks documenting his 80th birthday concert, which included Rollins&#x27;s first ever recorded appearance with Ornette Coleman on the twenty-minute &quot;Sonnymoon for Two&quot;); &quot;Road Shows, Vol. 3&quot;; and &quot;Holding the Stage&quot;, released in April 2016.

In 2010 Rollins was awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Edward MacDowell Medal; in the fall of the same year he celebrated his 80th birthday with a concert at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre that included a guest appearance by Ornette Coleman. The following year he was the subject of another documentary by Dick Fontaine, entitled &quot;Beyond the Notes&quot;.

Rollins has not performed in public since 2012, and retired in 2014, due to recurring respiratory issues caused by pulmonary fibrosis.

===2013–present===
In 2013, Rollins moved to Woodstock, New York. That spring, he made a guest television appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;Whiskey Business&quot; and received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Juilliard School in New York City.

In 2014 he was the subject of a Dutch television documentary entitled &quot;Sonny Rollins-Morgen Speel Ik Beter&quot; (transl: &quot;Tomorrow I&#x27;ll Play Better&quot;). He made a public appearance in June of that year introducing saxophonist Ornette Coleman at an all-star tribute performance to Coleman in Brooklyn, NY. In October 2015, he received the Jazz Foundation of America&#x27;s lifetime achievement award.

In the spring of 2017, Rollins donated his personal archive to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, one of the research centers of New York Public Library. Later that year, he endowed the &quot;Sonny Rollins Jazz Ensemble Fund&quot; at Oberlin College, in &quot;recognition of the institution&#x27;s long legacy of access and social justice advocacy.&quot;

In February 2023, Rollins sold his music catalogue to Reservoir Media. In April 2024 &quot;The Notebooks of Sonny Rollins&quot; was published, derived from notebooks he maintained from 1959 onwards.

==Influences==
As a saxophonist he had initially been attracted to the jump and R&amp;B sounds of performers like Louis Jordan, but soon became drawn into the mainstream tenor saxophone tradition. The German critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt described this tradition as sitting between the two poles of the strong sonority of Coleman Hawkins and the light flexible phrasing of Lester Young, which did so much to inspire the fleet improvisation of bebop in the 1950s. Other tenor saxophone influences include Ben Webster and Don Byas. By his mid-teens, Rollins became heavily influenced by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. During his high school years, he was mentored by the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, often rehearsing at Monk&#x27;s apartment.

==Instruments==
Rollins has played, at various times, a Selmer Mark VI tenor saxophone and a Buescher Aristocrat. During the 1970s he recorded on soprano saxophone for the album &quot;Easy Living&quot;. His preferred mouthpieces are made by Otto Link and Berg Larsen. He uses Frederick Hemke medium reeds.

<text>Gravenhurst is a town in the Muskoka Region of Ontario, Canada. It is located approximately south of Bracebridge, Ontario. The Town of Gravenhurst includes a large area of the District of Muskoka, known to Ontarians as &quot;cottage country.&quot; The town centre borders on two lakes: Lake Muskoka, which is the largest lake in the region, and Gull Lake, a smaller cottage-bordered lake. Another lake, Kahshe Lake, is situated south of the town.

==History==
Gravenhurst was first known as McCabes Landing for the first settler James McCabe and his wife Letitia Simington and later as Sawdust City. Gravenhurst was named by a postal official who was reading &quot;Gravenhurst or Thoughts on Good and Evil&quot;, a treatise by William Smith.

Gravenhurst&#x27;s economic prosperity stemmed from the construction of a colonization road in the 1850s. Steamboating on the Muskoka lakes began in the 1860s. The town was located strategically at the northern terminus of the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway. The town is positioned as the &quot;Gateway to Muskoka&quot;.

Nearby Muldrew Lake was named after the lake&#x27;s second cottager, Dr. William Hawthorne Muldrew. He was the principal of the first Gravenhurst high school in 1894. In 1901 he published a book called &quot;Sylvan Ontario, A Guide to Our Native Trees and Shrubs&quot;. It was the first book published on this subject in Ontario, and the drawings were his own. All the different types of trees and shrubs of Muskoka could be seen at the school, as he transplanted many of the specimens from Muldrew Lake.

In 1942 the Royal Norwegian Air Force moved their training camp (Little Norway) from Toronto Islands Airport to Muskoka airfield near Gravenhurst. The Norwegians remained in Gravenhurst almost to the end of World War II in 1945.

===Camp 20===
Between 1940 and 1946 Gravenhurst was home to a German prisoner-of-war camp known as Camp 20. The camp is also referred to as Camp Calydor and Muskoka Officer’s Club. Many describe Camp 20 as a vacation for the prisoners of war. The camp had a swimming area fenced in on Lake Muskoka where the prisoners could bathe. By the end of the first summer, Camp 20 held 489 prisoners. They were taken around Gravenhurst to work on various projects. The prisoners of war built a set of stone steps leading down to the waterfront which can still be seen at Gull Lake Park today. They also built a light house in the park.

The camp had its own gardens where the prisoners would grow their own vegetables and they were able to smoke sausages from the local animals. Some prisoners of war said that they became friends with the guards who sought to make the place as friendly as possible to avoid escapes. Many prisoners had the opportunity to work outside of the camp and lumber camps and received a small wage as well as access to the outside world. Through this access to the outside world many German prisoners of war had love affairs with the local girls.

Ulrich Steinhilper, a German fighter ace who shot down five RAF airplanes during the Battle of Britain before himself being shot down, was one of the prisoners here; he made at least five attempts to escape from various camps, his last two attempts being at Gravenhurst.

Today, all that remains of Camp 20 is concrete pillars, a fire hydrant, and the outline of a fence. There is an information kiosk at the end of Lorne Street where visitors can go to get more information on the camp.

Gravenhurst also declares itself the &quot;Gateway to the Muskoka Lakes&quot; and has a large gate bearing this message hanging over Muskoka District Road 169, the main road leading into town from Highway 11. The gate had been removed but was rebuilt in 2009 and stands again at the south end of town. It is the home port of the &quot;RMS Segwun&quot;, the oldest vessel powered by a working steam engine in North America.

Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services provides inter-city bus service to Gravenhurst along its Toronto to North Bay routes. The nearby Muskoka Airport has scheduled flights to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and also serves general aviation.

===The Muskoka Wharf===

The Muskoka Wharf, located on Lake Muskoka, was completed in 2005. The project cost $170 million and spreads across 89 acres. Before the new development was built, the wharf used to be used for lumber and boat building industries. It was also the entry point to the lakes. Years ago, a train would arrive at the wharf three times a day with passengers coming to Muskoka looking to settle.

Today, the wharf is full of retailers and restaurants. The wharf hosts a number of events in the summer including Pirate Fest and the Gravenhurst farmers’ market. There are also condominiums and a Marriott hotel for those looking to spend some time in Gravenhurst.

Every year Gravenhurst has a winter carnival for the community to enjoy. There are events for every age at the carnival including donut eating contests, sno-yoga, ball hockey, a polar dip, and arm wrestling. The town has several dances for anyone ages nineteen and older as well as fireworks on Sunday for the closing ceremony. The fireworks take place at the Muskoka Wharf.

==Education==
Located on the shore of Lake Muskoka since 1949 Gravenhurst had been home to the Ontario Fire College. The College was run by the Province of Ontario, under the Fire Marshall&#x27;s Office, and offered training and education programs which were based on the Ontario Fire Service Standards. Courses were available to members of any Ontario municipal fire department, whether full-time or volunteer. The Ontario Fire College was closed by the Progressive Conservative government on March 31, 2021.

Public education consists of Gravenhurst High School, and three elementary schools administered by the Trillium Lakelands District School Board.

<doc id="248418" wikidata="Q384788" url="?curid=248418" title="Ministro Pistarini International Airport">
<text>Ministro Pistarini International Airport () , also known as Ezeiza International Airport owing to its location in Ezeiza in Greater Buenos Aires, is an international airport south-southwest of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires, the capital city of Argentina. Covering , it is one of two commercial airports serving Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, along with Aeroparque Jorge Newbery. Pistarini Airport is the country&#x27;s largest international airport by number of passengers handled—85% of international traffic—and is a hub for international flights of Aerolíneas Argentinas, which operates domestic services from the airport as well. It has been operated by Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 S.A. since 1998.

== History ==
The airport is named after Juan Pistarini, Minister of Public Works during the presidency of Juan Perón, who placed the cornerstone of the project on 22 December 1945.

Its construction, which took four years to be completed, was one of the major projects in the five-year plan of the first presidency of Juan Perón. The airport was inaugurated on 30 April 1949. When it opened it was the third-largest airport in the world. A 1949 diagram shows three runways crossing at 60-degree angles: runway 10/28, 4/22 and 16/34.

The Ezeiza massacre took place near the airport in 1973.

== Operations ==
Since December 2012, citizens from countries requiring an entry visa for Argentine nationals including Australia and Canada are charged a &quot;reciprocity fee&quot; to enter Argentina, equivalent to the price the countries charge Argentine citizens for a visa. Until the tax was collected, in Argentine pesos or US dollars, at the airport; since then, the tax must be paid in advance online from the country of origin. As of 23 August 2016, the Argentine Government (Presidential Decree No. 959/2016) has resolved to suspend the collection of the reciprocity fee from US passport holders who visit the country for less than 90 days, for tourist or business purposes.

In October 2012, Ezeiza Airport recorded the highest annual traffic growth of all the airports operated by &quot;Aeropuertos Argentina 2000&quot;.

<text>Túrin Turambar (pronounced ) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. &quot;Turambar and the Foalókë&quot;, begun in 1917, is the first appearance of Túrin in the legendarium. Túrin is a Man of the First Age of Middle-earth, whose family had been cursed by the Dark Lord Morgoth. While trying vainly to defy the curse, Túrin brings ruin across much of Beleriand, and upon himself and his sister Niënor. His title, &quot;Turambar&quot;, means master of fate.

Tolkien consciously based the story on the tale of Kullervo in the 19th-century Finnish mythological poem &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Scholars have noted parallels with other myths including that of Sigmund and Sigurd in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; of Norse mythology; with the Greek myth of Oedipus; and in terms of structure and style, with Arthurian legend.

Excerpts have been published in prose in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; Part II, and &quot;The War of the Jewels&quot;, and in alliterative long-line verse in &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;. The complete story was published as &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; in 2007.

== Publication history ==

Tolkien wrote multiple versions of the tale of Túrin. These were published after his death, edited by his son Christopher Tolkien, as follows:

== Narrative ==

=== Dor-lómin ===

Túrin is the son of Húrin, Lord of the Folk of Hador, and Morwen of the House of Bëor. The Siege of Angband has been broken, but Túrin&#x27;s homeland of Dor-lómin in the northwest of Beleriand is still contested by Húrin against the Dark Lord Morgoth&#x27;s forces. When Túrin is eight, Húrin leads his Men to war; all are killed in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. Húrin is captured and cursed by Morgoth, who sends an army of Easterlings to Dor-lómin. Túrin remains with Morwen, who hides him and sends him secretly to the hidden Elven-realm of Doriath; Morwen remains in Dor-lómin, and shortly afterwards gives birth to a girl, Niënor.

=== Doriath ===

Túrin reaches Doriath, which is protected by an enchantment, the Girdle of Melian. The marchwarden Beleg leads them to the city of Menegroth, where King Thingol adopts Túrin, in memory of Húrin&#x27;s heroism. The Elven-lady Nellas watches over Túrin at Melian&#x27;s bidding, teaching him Elven-lore. Túrin becomes esteemed for his prowess, and Beleg teaches him warfare. When after some years Dor-lómin is cut off and news from Morwen and Niënor ceases to arrive, Túrin decides to pit his strength against Morgoth&#x27;s forces, hoping to avenge the sorrows of his kin. Thingol appoints him a &quot;knight of the sword&quot;. Túrin departs to fight the Orcs in the north of Doriath, where he is joined by Beleg. His chief weapon is the sword, and he wears the Dragon-helm of Hador, so that the Orcs fear him. At the age of 20, Túrin accidentally kills Saeros, one of Thingol&#x27;s counsellors, who had insulted him. Ignoring advice, he flees from Doriath, fearing imprisonment. Thingol pardons Túrin, and Beleg obtains leave to seek out his friend.

=== Amon Rûdh ===

Túrin, unaware of this, flees westward, joining a band of outlaws in Gaurwaith and becomes its leader by accidentally killing their captain. Beleg finds the band in the wild, but Túrin rejects Beleg&#x27;s advice to return to Doriath. Túrin&#x27;s band captures Mîm the Petty-dwarf. To save his life, Mîm shares his dwellings on the hill of Amon Rûdh with the band. Beleg returns to Túrin, bringing the Dragon-helm. The &quot;Two Captains&quot; free much of West Beleriand from evil, but the Dragon-helm reveals Túrin&#x27;s identity to Morgoth, who attacks Amon Rûdh. The Orcs find Mîm, and he buys his life by leading them up the hill. Túrin is captured and all his men killed; Beleg escapes. Beleg follows the Orcs through the forest of Taur-nu-Fuin, and meets Gwindor, an escaped slave from Angband. Together they rescue Túrin in Anfauglith. Unfortunately, while Beleg is cutting the sleeping Túrin free from his bonds, he pricks Túrin&#x27;s foot with the black sword Anglachel. Túrin, mistaking him in the darkness for an Orc, takes the sword and kills Beleg. Gwindor leads the grief-stricken Túrin to the Pools of Ivrin, where he returns to his senses.

=== Nargothrond ===

They journey to the hidden fortress of Nargothrond, where Gwindor had been a lord. He gives Beleg&#x27;s sword Anglachel to Túrin, who has it reforged and renamed &quot;Gurthang&quot;, &quot;Iron of Death&quot;. Túrin hides his own name, becoming known as &quot;Mormegil&quot; or the &quot;Blacksword of Nargothrond&quot;. Gwindor meets his beloved, Finduilas daughter of King Orodreth, but she unwillingly falls in love with Túrin; Túrin does not perceive this and holds her in awe. Túrin becomes a chief counsellor to the King. He encourages the Elves to abandon their secrecy, and they build a great bridge before the Doors of Nargothrond and clear the land between the River Sirion and the coastal Falas from enemies. Túrin becomes arrogant, ignoring even a warning from the godlike Vala Ulmo to destroy the bridge and return to secrecy.

After five years, Morgoth sends a great host of Orcs led by the dragon Glaurung. Túrin persuades Orodreth to fight them in the open. In the ensuing Battle of Tumhalad, Nargothrond&#x27;s forces are destroyed and Orodreth is killed; the bridge helps Morgoth&#x27;s forces to locate the fortress and cross the river Narog. Túrin fights Glaurung off, but leaves the battle to carry away the mortally wounded Gwindor. Before Gwindor dies, he instructs Túrin to save Finduilas, prophesying that she alone can avert Túrin&#x27;s doom. Hastening to save the captives, Túrin is caught by Glaurung&#x27;s powerful gaze. He stands by enspelled as Finduilas is dragged away, calling to him. The dragon deceives him into believing that Morwen and Niënor are suffering in Dor-lómin; Túrin abandons Finduilas to seek out his kin. When he reaches Dor-lómin, he finds that Morwen had already left for Doriath before the fall of Nargothrond. In his rage he kills the people around him.

=== Brethil ===

Túrin next tries to find Finduilas, travelling to the forest of Brethil, but is too late: the woodmen inform him that she had been killed by the Orcs when the Men of Brethil tried to rescue her. Túrin collapses in grief upon her grave, and is brought to a village in the forest, Ephel Brandir. There he takes up his life again, now calling himself &quot;Turambar&quot; (&quot;Master of Doom&quot;) and renouncing his descent, hoping to overcome his curse. The Folk of Haleth dwelling there are ruled by Brandir the Lame, who hopes to preserve his people by secrecy. Turambar quickly gains power, gathering companies to fight Orcs. He stops wielding Gurthang and fights using a spear and a bow.

When Morwen and Niënor hear the news of Nargothrond&#x27;s destruction, they rashly go to look for Túrin. Glaurung, now living in the ruins of Nargothrond, descends into the river to create a fog. Morwen loses her way in the fog, but Niënor meets the dragon and is enspelled by him, forgetting her past. She flees to Brethil. Turambar finds her at Finduilas&#x27;s grave, naked, unable to speak and remembering nothing. He names her &quot;Níniel&quot;, &quot;Maid of Tears&quot;, and takes her to Ephel Brandir. There she is healed by Brandir, who falls in love with her; but Níniel and Turambar come to love each other. Turambar asks her to marry him; Brandir dissuades her, foreboding evil, but they are married. Turambar goes back to war when Glaurung sends Orcs to attack Brethil: taking up the sword again, Turambar drives them away. Next year Níniel conceives, and Glaurung attacks Brethil in person.

Turambar decides to ambush the Dragon and to try stabbing him from beneath. Of his two companions, Dorlas deserts, and Hunthor is killed by a stone. Turambar mortally wounds Glaurung with Gurthang, but is poisoned by the Dragon&#x27;s blood and falls in a swoon. When Níniel comes to search for him, Glaurung with his last words undoes his spell, and she remembers who she is, and that Turambar is her brother. Horrified, Niënor drowns herself in the river Teiglin.

Brandir tauntingly tells Turambar what has happened. Turambar kills the defenceless Brandir and runs in madness to Finduilas&#x27;s grave. There an Elf of Doriath, Mablung, confirms the words of Brandir. Turambar flees and kills himself with Gurthang. He is buried in a high mound, together with the shards of the sword. A great stone is set upon the grave, upon which the Elves write in Cirth runes:

However, Niënor&#x27;s body is not there. Two years later Morwen and Húrin meet there for the last time; Morwen is later buried there. The mound survives the War of Wrath and the Drowning of Beleriand; Tol Morwen becomes an island off the coast of Middle-earth.

=== Fate after death ===

Tolkien wrote several versions of a prophecy about Túrin&#x27;s fate after death.

The fragmentary earliest outline mentions &quot;purification of Turambar and Vainóni who fare shining about the world and go with the hosts of Tulkas against Melko.&quot; In the finished manuscript of &quot;The Tale of Turambar and the Foalókë&quot;, this becomes a story that Túrin and Niënor were only admitted to Mandos after their parents&#x27; prayers; they entered the &quot;bath of flame&quot;, where the Sun replenished its light, &quot;and so were all their sorrows and stains washed away, and they dwelt as shining Valar among the blessed ones.&quot; A new detail is introduced, that &quot;Turambar indeed shall stand beside Fionwë in the Great Wrack, and Melko and his drakes shall curse the sword of Mormakil&quot;.

In Tolkien&#x27;s later writings, Niënor&#x27;s fate is not mentioned, but Túrin&#x27;s destiny is made even more prominent. Túrin would take part in the Last Battle before the End of the World, when Morgoth would return and make the final assault upon the Valar and the Children of Ilúvatar. In the &quot;Earliest Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;the spirit of Túrin&quot; comes back and fights, and &quot;it shall be Túrin who with his black sword will slay Morgoth&quot;, elaborated in the 1930 revision of the &quot;Quenta Noldorinwa&quot;. In &quot;The Problem of Ros&quot; (1968 or later), the last time Tolkien returned to the subject, Túrin is prophesied to return from death and kill Ancalagon the Black in the War of Wrath, replacing the role of Eärendil.

=== Line of Túrin and Niënor ===

== Analysis ==
=== Mythological parallels ===

Tolkien noted some of Túrin&#x27;s mythological parallels in a letter to the publisher Milton Waldman:

Túrin, as Tolkien stated, is mainly based on Kullervo, a character from the Finnish folklore poems known as &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Kullervo similarly committed unwitting incest with his sister, brought ruin upon his family, and slew himself. In Norse mythology, Sigmund, the father of Sigurd in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, resembles Túrin in the incestuous relationship he has with his sister. In Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (drawn in part from the Völsung myths), Siegmund and Sieglinde are parallels of Túrin and Niënor. Further, Túrin is like Sigurd, as both achieve great renown for the slaying of a dragon of immense power: in Sigurd&#x27;s case Fafnir; in Túrin&#x27;s, Glaurung.
The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger further likens the tale of Túrin to Arthurian Legend, with its complex manuscript history and &quot;overlapping story variants in both poetry and prose&quot;, supplemented by Tolkien&#x27;s pretence that he was translating a lost &quot;Narn&quot; poem from its original Elvish language.

Tolkien mentions the resemblance to the unfortunate Oedipus, prince of Thebes, who unwittingly fulfils a prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. The Tolkien scholar Richard C. West, in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that the tale &quot;is one of almost unrelieved gloom&quot;, though a prophecy in Tolkien&#x27;s mythology holds that Túrin will help in the final defeat of Morgoth, after the end of the world, and that he and his sister will be cleansed of their sin. West writes that as in many other stories of Middle-earth, there is a &quot;delicate balance&quot; between fate, whereby each character inevitably takes certain actions and suffers the consequences, and free will, whereby he makes his own bold or rash choices that determine the outcomes for him.

=== A woman in wartime ===
According to the biographer Charles Moseley, Niënor and Turin are one of only four &quot;couples whose love gets much space&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s works; the others are Lúthien and Beren; Eärendil and Elwing; and Aragorn and Arwen. West described the story of Niënor&#x27;s family as tragic. Elizabeth A. Whittingham wrote in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot; that the story had grown darker with time, commenting that &quot;no tale of Middle-earth is as dark as that&quot;, and stating that in its rendition in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; with the end omitted, contrary to the author&#x27;s original intent, &quot;all glimmer of hope has been extinguished&quot;. The scholar of literature Victoria Holtz-Wodzak calls Niënor a &quot;study of the lives of women during wartime. She is, for all practical purposes, a war orphan&quot;. Holtz-Wodzak sees the war-time fate of the women in Tolkien&#x27;s life as well as his own experiences as inspiration for the character and its sympathetic treatment by the author. Holtz-Wodzak also compares his situation to that of Brandír, who as a non-combatant loses the struggle with Turambar for both the respect of his people and the love of Níniel. The scholar even sees an echo of Tolkien&#x27;s sentiments about not being able to be active in World War II due to age in &quot;Niennor&#x27;s desperate wish either to keep the man she loves from danger or to die with him&quot;.

==Biography==
Drew was born on August 28, 1928, in New York City, United States, and he received piano lessons from the age of five. He attended the High School of Music &amp; Art in Manhattan. His first recording, in 1950, was with trumpeter Howard McGhee, and over the next two years Drew worked in bands led by Buddy DeFranco, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Charlie Parker, among others.

After a brief period with his own trio in California, Drew returned to New York, playing with Dinah Washington, Johnny Griffin, Buddy Rich, and several others over the following few years. He led many recording sessions throughout the 1950s, and in 1957 appeared on John Coltrane&#x27;s album &quot;Blue Train&quot;.

Drew was one of the American jazz musicians who settled in Europe around this period: he moved to Paris, France, in 1961 and to Copenhagen, Denmark, three years later. While he sacrificed much of the interest of the American jazz audience, he gained a wide following across Europe. Drew was a well-known figure on the Copenhagen jazz scene, recording many sessions with the Danish bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. &quot;Living in Copenhagen, and travelling out from there,&quot; Drew remarked, &quot;I have probably worked in more different contexts than if I had stayed in New York where I might have got musically locked in with a set-group of musicians. This way, I have been able to keep my musical antennas in shape, while at the same time I have had more time to study and also get deeper into my own endeavors.&quot;

Drew and Dexter Gordon appeared on screen in Ole Ege&#x27;s theatrically released hardcore pornographic film &quot;Pornografi – en musical&quot; (1971), for which they composed and performed the score.

Drew died in August 1993 in Copenhagen, Denmark (he had stomach cancer, but it was unclear if this was the cause of death) and he was interred in the Assistens Cemetery in Nørrebro, Copenhagen. A street is named after him in southern Copenhagen, &quot;Kenny Drews Vej&quot; (Eng., Kenny Drew’s Road).

His son, Kenny Drew Jr., was also a jazz pianist.

==Playing style==
Drew&#x27;s touch was described in &quot;The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz&quot; as &quot;precise&quot;, and his playing as being a combination of bebop-influenced melodic improvisation and block chords, including &quot;refreshingly subtle harmonizations&quot;.

Paris was voted &quot;the Prettiest Little Town in Canada&quot; by &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; Magazine. The town was established in 1850. In 1999, its town government was amalgamated into that of the County of Brant, ending 149 years as a separate incorporated municipality, with Paris as the largest population centre in the county.

==History==
Paris was named for the nearby deposits of gypsum, used to make plaster of Paris. This material was discovered in 1793 while the area was being surveyed for the British Home Department. By late 1794 a road had been built from what is now Dundas, Ontario, to the east bank of the Grand River in what became Paris, called The Governor&#x27;s Road (now Dundas St. in Paris). The town has been referred to as &quot;the cobblestone capital of Canada&quot; (in reference to a number of aged cobblestone houses).

The town was first settled on 7 May 1829, when its founder, Hiram Capron, originally from Vermont, bought the land at the Forks of the Grand in 1829 for $10,000 and divided some land into town lots. Capron built a grist mill on the present townsite and was also involved in opening an iron foundry and in mining of gypsum

Records from 1846 indicate that the settlement, in a hilly area called Oak Plains, was divided into the upper town and the lower town. In addition to successful farmers in the area, the community of 1000 people (Americans, Scottish, English, and Irish) was thriving. Manufacturing had already begun, with industries powered by the river. A great deal of plaster was being exported and there were three mills, a tannery, a woolen factory, a foundry, and numerous tradesmen. Five churches had been built; the post office was receiving mail three times a week.

The village was incorporated in 1850 with Hiram &quot;Boss&quot; Capron as the first Reeve. It was incorporated as a town in 1856 with H. Finlayson as the first mayor. By 1869, the population was about 3,200.

While the telephone was invented at Brantford, Ontario, in 1874, Alexander Graham Bell reminded people in the area about a Paris connection. &quot;Brantford is right in claiming the invention of the telephone&quot; and &quot;the first transmission to a distance was made between Brantford and Paris&quot; (on 3 August 1876).

The use of cobblestones to construct buildings had been introduced to the area by Levi Boughton when he erected St. James Church in 1839; this was the first cobblestone structure in Paris. Two churches and ten homes, all in current use, are made of numerous such stones taken from the rivers. Other architectural styles that are visible in the downtown area include Edwardian, Gothic, and Post Modern.

Paris is also the transmitter site for a number of broadcast radio and TV stations serving the Brantford and Kitchener-Waterloo areas. The actual tower site is 475 Ayr Road, just south of the town of Ayr, and it was erected and owned by Global Television Network in 1974 for CIII-TV. It was officially the main transmitter for the southern Ontario Global network until 2009, when its Toronto rebroadcaster (which had been the &quot;de facto&quot; main transmitter, given that the station was and still is based in Toronto) was redesignated as the main transmitter. Global leases space on the Ayr tower for broadcast clients including Conestoga College&#x27;s campus radio station CJIQ-FM as well as local rebroadcasters of the CBC&#x27;s Toronto-based outlets.

The town hosts an annual Fall Fair which takes place over the Labour Day weekend. The Fair has rural lifestyle exhibits, a midway complete with carnival games, rides, and a demolition derby. The Fair is also host to country music nights which have included big-name acts such as Montgomery Gentry, Gord Bamford, Emerson Drive, Chad Brownlee, Deric Ruttan, Kira Isabella, and James Barker Band.

Paris is also the northernmost community to participate in Southern Ontario&#x27;s Green Energy Hub.

Since the late 1990s, Paris has experienced population growth, which may be in part attributed to the rising popularity of rural communities among GTA bound commuters (see bedroom community) and the completion of Highway 403 between Hamilton and Woodstock.

==Municipal government==
The County is divided into five wards, each with two elected Councillors. The Mayor from 1999 to 2018 was Ron Eddy. David Bailey became the new mayor in October 2018. The County provides fire and ambulance services but contracts with the Ontario Provincial Police to provide police services, overseen by the Police Services Board. The administrative offices are located in Burford, Ontario.

<doc id="248426" wikidata="Q1938153" url="?curid=248426" title="Smiths Falls">
<text>Smiths Falls is a town in Eastern Ontario, Canada, southwest of Ottawa. As of the 2021 census it has a population of 9,254. It is in the Census division for Lanark County, but is separated from the county. The Rideau Canal waterway passes through the town, with four separate locks in three locations and a combined lift of over .

The town&#x27;s name was previously spelled Smith&#x27;s Falls, and the spelling Smith Falls has been used, but &quot;Smiths Falls&quot; is now the official correct form.

==History==
===Early history and naming===
Smiths Falls was incorporated first as a village in 1854, and then as a town in 1882.

It is named after Thomas Smyth, a United Empire Loyalist who in 1786 was granted in what is present-day Smiths Falls. The Heritage House Museum (c. 1862), also known as the Ward House, was designated under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1977.

In about 1920 the town council voted to change the name from Smith&#x27;s Falls to Smiths Falls, and this spelling entered general use, but in 1967 the Ontario Municipal Board stated that it was not official and the town&#x27;s legal documents must use the spelling Smith&#x27;s Falls found in the 1882 order-in-council of incorporation. The town then applied to the provincial government for an official change to Smiths Falls, and in 1968 the legislature granted the change by private bill.

===Building of the Rideau Canal===

At the time of construction of the Rideau Canal a small settlement had been established around a mill operated by Abel Russell Ward, who had bought Smyth&#x27;s land. Colonel By ordered the removal of Ward&#x27;s mill to make way for the canal. He settled with Ward for £1,500, one of the largest claims made by mill owners on the canal.

The disruption of industry caused by the building of the canal was only temporary, and Smiths Falls grew rapidly following construction. An article in &quot;Smith&#x27;s Gazetteer&quot; in 1846 described the town as a &quot;flourishing little village pleasantly situated on the Rideau River and on the Canal, from Perth. It contains about 700 inhabitants. There are fifty dwellings, two grist mills (one with four run of stones), two sawmills, one carding and fulling mill, seven stores, six groceries, one axe factory, six blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, one cabinet maker, one chair-maker, three carpenters, one gunsmith, eleven shoemakers, seven tailors, one tinsmith and two taverns.&quot;

A drop in less than posed an obstacle to navigation at Smiths Falls. A natural depression to the south of the river was used to create a flight of three locks, known as Combined Lockstation today. The natural course of the river was dammed to create a basin upstream of the locks. At the upper end of the basin a fourth (detached) lock was constructed.

 below the Combined Lockstation is a flight of two locks called the Old Slys Lockstation. This station is named for the original settler at this location, William Sly. A dam and waste weir control water levels upstream of the locks.

Defensible lockmasters&#x27; houses were built at all three stations in Smiths Falls. The house at Old Slys was built in 1838 and the houses at Combined and Detached around 1842. Only the house at Combined has a second storey, which was added late in the 19th century. The defensible lockmaster&#x27;s house at Detached Lockstation was torn down in 1894.

===Entry of the railways===

In the 1850s the major railway companies were looking to build main trunk lines linking Toronto, Kingston and Montreal. The two major companies at the time, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway, were competing for the easiest routes to lay track. At one point a fledgling third national railway, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), was also trying to squeeze itself into the busy Montréal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor.

For a number of geographical reasons, and also due to the proximity of the Rideau Canal, the town of Smiths Falls became a major focal point for both the CPR and the CNoR. Each used a mix of existing regional rail lines and new construction to build their networks. CP purchased the 1859-era Brockville and Ottawa Railway, a line from Brockville-Smiths Falls-Sand Point/Arnprior with a branch Smiths Falls-Perth (the latter joining CP&#x27;s Ontario and Quebec Railway line to Toronto). CNoR built a 1914-era main line from Ottawa-Smiths Falls-Sydenham (to join an existing Bay of Quinte Railway line extending westward via Napanee-Deseronto). By 1887, the CPR had extended its Toronto-Smiths Falls mainline to reach Montréal; in 1924, 1600 CPR workers were employed in Smiths Falls.

This gave the town direct rail lines in half a dozen directions (towards Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal, Brockville, Napanee and Arnprior) on two different rail companies.

During World War II, Axis prisoners of war (POWs) were transported to Canadian POW camps via the railway. It was near Smiths Falls that German soldier Oberleutnant Franz von Werra jumped from a POW train and escaped to the United States, eventually reaching his homeland. Von Werra was, reputedly, the only escaped Axis POW to successfully return home during the war and his story was told in the book and film entitled &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;. The North American première of the film occurred on Thursday, 6 March 1958 at the Soper Theatre in Smiths Falls.

Both the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian Northern (later part of Canadian National) had established stations in the town, however, with the creation of Via Rail, the CN station was abandoned and all passenger traffic routed through the CPR station until a new Smiths Falls railway station opened in 2010. The CN station has been renovated and is now home to the Railway Museum of Eastern Ontario. The railway station, along with the nearby railway bascule bridge, comprise the town&#x27;s two National Historic Sites of Canada. The Cataraqui Trail now follows the former CN railbed southwest from Smiths Falls, starting from a parking lot at the end of Ferrara Drive.

==Economy==

The town is on the Rideau Canal system for recreational boating, and is served by the Smiths Falls-Montague Airport (Russ Beach) for general aviation. It is also a major railway junction point, and its station receives regular passenger service to Ottawa and Toronto from Via Rail.

Several manufacturers were based in Smiths Falls, perhaps the best-known being the Canadian operation of The Hershey Company (opened in 1963) which closed in December 2008. Hershey announced they would instead open a factory in Mexico, where they could obtain cheaper labour. In late 2006, the plant was temporarily closed due to a case of possible salmonella contamination. Other former large manufacturers include RCA Victor (closed circa 1980), Frost and Wood / Cockshutt and Stanley Tools (2008). The closure of the Rideau Regional hospital site in March 2009 resulted in a further loss of jobs from the community. However, the site was purchased by a local developer (who made an unsuccessful bid for mayor in the 2018 election) and renamed the Gallipeau Centre. It is a mixed use property with residential and recreational uses including condominiums, a recreational facility, swimming pool and theatre. In 2014, the former Hershey facility was purchased by medical marijuana company Tweed Marijuana Inc, now known as publicly traded company Canopy Growth Corporation (TSE:WEED). The town has been cited as the &quot;Pot Capital of Canada&quot;. Over 750 jobs have been created by Canopy Growth which has revitalized the town&#x27;s economy after the departure of the Hershey factory and the closure of Rideau Regional Centre. Investment by Constellation Brands of $5B in Canopy Growth Corporation has helped further secure the positive economic potential for Smiths Falls. The company is continuing to grow and expand, creating new local jobs. Canopy has purchased the site of the closed Shorewood Packaging building to construct a facility for bottling cannabis infused beverages. As well, chocolate has begun to flow again at the site of the former Hershey plant as Canopy Growth has commenced the production of cannabis infused chocolate edibles. Public tours of Tweed production are available to the public, similar to the Hershey factory tours. There has been significant growth in construction in the community. However, Canopy Growth resold the former Hershey plant back to Hershey in 2023 to reduce its debt.

Despite the policing of Smiths Falls being conducted by the Smiths Falls Police Service, the Ontario Provincial Police operates two facilities in Smiths Falls, namely a Communications Centre and the Eastern Regional Headquarters. The Communications Centre is scheduled to close in June 2022. There are presently no plans to close the Eastern Regional Headquarters.

==Sports and recreation==
In 1906, a hockey team from Smiths Falls launched an unsuccessful challenge to win the Stanley Cup. Smiths Falls was home to a professional baseball team, the Smiths Falls Beavers, for one season in 1937. The team was a part of the Canadian–American League.

The town is currently home to the Junior A hockey team Smiths Falls Bears, who play in the Central Canada Hockey League. Smiths Falls is also home to the Settlers organization which is a member of the Canadian Premier Junior Hockey League (CPJHL), which operates throughout Ontario and Western Quebec.

There are many opportunities for minor and adult league sports including baseball, volleyball, basketball, soccer, ball hockey and hockey (for men and women). Lower Reach, located next to Rideau River, is home to baseball diamonds, soccer fields, play structures and a splash pad.

The Rideau Trail passes through Smiths Falls.
