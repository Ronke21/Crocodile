<text>A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted &quot;work&quot;. A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that the author has created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author&#x27;s work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.

There are several types of Creative Commons licenses. Each license differs by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002, by Creative Commons, a U.S. non-profit corporation founded in 2001. There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses, numbered 1.0 through 4.0. Released in November 2013, the 4.0 license suite is the most current. While the Creative Commons license was originally grounded in the American legal system, there are now several Creative Commons jurisdiction ports which accommodate international laws.

In October 2014, the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC BY, CC BY-SA and CC0 licenses as conformant with the &quot;Open Definition&quot; for content and data.

== History ==

Lawrence Lessig and Eric Eldred designed the Creative Commons License (CCL) in 2001 because they saw a need for a license between the existing modes of copyright and public domain status. Version 1.0 of the licenses was officially released on 16 December 2002.

=== Origins ===
The CCL allows inventors to keep the rights to their innovations while also allowing for some external use of the invention. The CCL emerged as a reaction to the decision in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled constitutional provisions of the Copyright Term Extension Act that extended the copyright term of works to be the last living author&#x27;s lifespan plus an additional 70 years.

=== License porting ===
The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind; therefore, the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other jurisdictions, rendering the licenses unenforceable there. To address this issue, Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called &quot;porting&quot;. As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions worldwide.

== International use ==

=== Chinese use ===
Working with Creative Commons, the Chinese government adapted the Creative Commons License to the Chinese context, replacing the individual monetary compensation of U.S. copyright law with incentives to Chinese innovators to innovate as a social contribution.

== Applicable works ==

Work licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law. This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites.

=== Software ===
While software is also governed by copyright law and CC licenses are applicable, the CC recommends against using it in software specifically due to backward-compatibility limitations with existing commonly used software licenses. Instead, developers may resort to use more software-friendly free and open-source software (FOSS) software licenses. Outside the FOSS licensing use case for software there are several usage examples to utilize CC licenses to specify a &quot;Freeware&quot; license model; examples are The White Chamber, Mari0 or Assault Cube. Despite the status of CC0 as the most free copyright license, the Free Software Foundation does not recommend releasing software into the public domain using the CC0 due to patent concerns.

However, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions. Furthermore, Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable. Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license.

When works are protected by more than one Creative Commons license, the user may choose any of them.

=== Preconditions ===
The author, or the licensor in case the author did a contractual transfer of rights, needs to have the exclusive rights on the work. If the work has already been published under a public license, it can be uploaded by any third party, once more on another platform, by using a compatible license, and making reference and attribution to the original license (e.g. by referring to the URL of the original license).

=== Consequences ===
The license is non-exclusive, royalty-free, and unrestricted in terms of territory and duration, so it is irrevocable, unless a new license is granted by the author after the work has been significantly modified. Any use of the work that is not covered by other copyright rules triggers the public license. Upon activation of the license, the licensee must adhere to all conditions of the license, otherwise the license agreement is illegitimate, and the licensee would commit a copyright infringement. The author, or the licensor as a proxy, has the legal rights to act upon any copyright infringement. The licensee has a limited period to correct any non-compliance.

==Types of licenses ==
=== Four rights ===
The CC licenses all grant &quot;baseline rights&quot;, such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide for non-commercial purposes and without modification. In addition, different versions of license prescribe different rights, as shown in this table:

The last two clauses are not free content licenses, according to definitions such as DFSG or the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as Wikipedia. For software, Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the BSD License, the GNU LGPL, and the GNU GPL.

Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the &quot;ND&quot; and &quot;SA&quot; clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the &quot;BY&quot; clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website. This leaves six regularly used licenses plus the CC0 public domain declaration.

=== Six regularly used licenses ===
The six licenses in most frequent use are shown in the following table. Among them, those accepted by the Wikimedia Foundation – the public domain dedication and two attribution (BY and BY-SA) licenses – allow the sharing and remixing (creating derivative works), including for commercial use, so long as attribution is given.
=== Zero, public domain ===


Besides copyright licenses, Creative Commons also offers CC0, a tool for relinquishing copyright and releasing material into the public domain. CC0 is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible. Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license. Development of CC0 began in 2007 and it was released in 2009. A major target of the license was the scientific data community.

In 2010, Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark, a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification, which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.

In 2011, the Free Software Foundation added CC0 to its free software licenses. However, the Free Software Foundation currently does not recommend using CC0 to release software into the public domain because it explicitly does not grant a patent license.

In February 2012, CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval. However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added for scientific data rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users&#x27; defenses against software patents. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.

From 2013 to 2017, the stock photography website Unsplash used the CC0 license, distributing several million free photos a month. Lawrence Lessig, the founder of Creative Commons, has contributed to the site. Unsplash moved from using the CC0 license to a custom license in June 2017 and to an explicitly nonfree license in January 2018.

In October 2014, the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC0 as conformant with the Open Definition and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain.

In July 2022, Fedora Linux disallowed software licensed under CC0 due to patent rights explicitly not being waived under the license.

=== Retired licenses ===
Due to either disuse or criticism, a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired, and are no longer recommended for new works. The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element other than CC0, as well as the following four licenses:
* Developing Nations License: a license which only applies to developing countries deemed to be &quot;non-high-income economies&quot; by the World Bank. Full copyright restrictions apply to people in other countries.
* Sampling: parts of the work can be used for any purpose other than advertising, but the whole work cannot be copied or modified
* Sampling Plus: parts of the work can be copied and modified for any purpose other than advertising, and the entire work can be copied for noncommercial purposes
* NonCommercial Sampling Plus: the whole work or parts of the work can be copied and modified for non-commercial purposes

== Version 4.0 ==

The latest version 4.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, released on November 25, 2013, are generic licenses that are applicable to most jurisdictions and do not usually require ports. No new ports have been implemented in version 4.0 of the license. Version 4.0 discourages using ported versions and instead acts as a single global license.

== Rights and obligations ==
=== Attribution ===
Since 2004, all current licenses other than the CC0 variant require attribution of the original author, as signified by the BY component (as in the preposition &quot;by&quot;). The attribution must be given to &quot;the best of [one&#x27;s] ability using the information available&quot;. Creative Commons suggests the mnemonic &quot;TASL&quot;: &quot;title&quot; – &quot;author – source&quot; [web link] – [CC] &quot;licence&quot;. Generally this implies the following:
* Include any copyright notices (if applicable). If the work itself contains any copyright notices placed there by the copyright holder, those notices must be left intact, or reproduced in a way that is reasonable to the medium in which the work is being re-published.
* Cite the author&#x27;s name, screen name, or user ID, etc. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link that name to the person&#x27;s profile page, if such a page exists.
* Cite the work&#x27;s title or name (if applicable), if such a thing exists. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link the name or title directly to the original work.
* Cite the specific CC license the work is under. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice if the license citation links to the license on the CC website.
* Mention if the work is a derivative work or adaptation. In addition to the above, one needs to identify that their work is a derivative work, e.g., &quot;This is a Finnish translation of [original work] by [author].&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on [original work] by [author].&quot;

=== Non-commercial licenses ===

The NonCommercial license allows image creators to restrict selling and profiting from their works by other parties and thus maintaining free of charge access to images.

The &quot;non-commercial&quot; option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition, as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non-commercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of open content promoted by other permissive licenses. In 2014 Wikimedia Deutschland published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as for translations and as PDF.

=== Adaptability ===

Rights in an adaptation can be expressed by a CC license that is compatible with the status or licensing of the original work or works on which the adaptation is based.

== Legal aspects ==
The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it.

Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases. Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses.
=== Dutch tabloid ===
In early 2006, podcaster Adam Curry sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry&#x27;s Flickr page without Curry&#x27;s permission. The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, commented, &quot;The Dutch Court&#x27;s decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license.&quot;

=== Virgin Mobile ===
In 2007, Virgin Mobile Australia launched an advertising campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to Flickr using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer&#x27;s Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church, caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile. The photo was taken by Alison&#x27;s church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license. In 2008, the case (concerning personality rights rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction.

=== &quot;SGAE vs Fernández&quot; ===
In the fall of 2006, the collecting society (SGAE) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in Badajoz who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society&#x27;s claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.

In February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and represented by Javier de la Cueva) was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said:

=== &quot;GateHouse Media, Inc. v. That&#x27;s Great News, LLC&quot; ===
On June 30, 2010, GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit against That is Great News. GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including &quot;Rockford Register Star&quot;, which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That is Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles. GateHouse sued That is Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public.

=== &quot;Drauglis v. Kappa Map Group, LLC&quot; ===
In 2007, photographer Art Drauglis uploaded several pictures to the photo-sharing website Flickr, giving them the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License (CC BY-SA). One photo, titled &quot;Swain&#x27;s Lock, Montgomery Co., MD.&quot;, was downloaded by Kappa Map Group, a map-making company, and published in 2012 on the front cover of &quot;Montgomery Co. Maryland Street Atlas&quot;. The text &quot;Photo: Swain&#x27;s Lock, Montgomery Co., MD Photographer: Carly Lesser &amp; Art Drauglis, Creative Commoms , CC-BY-SA-2.0&quot; was placed on the back cover, but nothing on the front indicated authorship.

The validity of the CC BY-SA 2.0 as a license was not in dispute. The CC BY-SA 2.0 requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY-SA 2.0 terms. The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis&#x27; license terms that would apply to &quot;derivative works&quot; applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants in June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, fees, and costs. Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group &quot;exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed.&quot; The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph in the sense of the license, but rather a collective work. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed.

In particular, the judge determined that it was sufficient to credit the author of the photo as prominently as authors of similar authorship (such as the authors of individual maps contained in the book) and that the name &quot;CC-BY-SA-2.0&quot; is sufficiently precise to locate the correct license on the internet and can be considered a valid identifier for the license.

=== Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet (VGSE) ===
In July 2016, German computer magazine &quot;LinuxUser&quot; reported that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two -licensed photographs from Berlin photographer Dennis Skley on his private blog Linuxundich. Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original. Langner was later contacted by the (VGSE) (Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet) with a demand for €2300 for failing to provide the full name of the work, the full name of the author, the license text, and a source link, as is required by the fine print in the license. Of this sum, €40 goes to the photographer, and the remainder is retained by VGSE. The Higher Regional Court of Cologne dismissed the claim in May 2019.

== Works with a Creative Commons license ==

Creative Commons maintains a content directory wiki of organizations and projects using Creative Commons licenses. On its website CC also provides case studies of projects using CC licenses across the world. CC licensed content can also be accessed through a number of content directories and search engines.

== Unicode symbols ==

After being proposed by Creative Commons in 2017, Creative Commons license symbols were added to Unicode with version 13.0 in 2020. The circle with an equal sign (meaning &quot;no derivatives&quot;) is present in older versions of Unicode, unlike all the other symbols.
These symbols can be used in succession to indicate a particular Creative Commons license, for example, &quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; (CC-Attribution-ShareAlike) can be expressed with Unicode symbols codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 placed next to each other: 🅭🅯🄎

== Case law database ==
In December2020, the Creative Commons organization launched an online database covering licensing case law and legal scholarship.

<text>Trial and error is a fundamental method of problem-solving characterized by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success, or until the practicer stops trying.

According to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan (1852–1936) after trying out similar phrases &quot;trial and failure&quot; and &quot;trial and practice&quot;. Under Morgan&#x27;s Canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behavior seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial-and-error learning. An example is a skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behavior. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

Edward Lee Thorndike was the initiator of the theory of trial and error learning based on the findings he showed how to manage a trial-and-error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning. He plotted to learn curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike&#x27;s key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by B. F. Skinner&#x27;s operant conditioning.

Trial and error is also a method of problem solving, repair, tuning, or obtaining knowledge. In the field of computer science, the method is called generate and test ([[Brute-force search|brute force]]). In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is called guess and check.

This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem-solving, contrasted with an approach using insight and theory. However, there are intermediate methods that, for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as &quot;guided empiricism&quot;.

This way of thinking has become a mainstay of Karl Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism.

==Methodology==
The trial and error approach is used most successfully with simple problems and in games, and it is often the last resort when no apparent rule applies. This does not mean that the approach is inherently careless, for an individual can be methodical in manipulating the variables in an attempt to sort through possibilities that could result in success. Nevertheless, this method is often used by people who have little knowledge in the problem area. The trial-and-error approach has been studied from its natural computational point of view 

===Simplest applications===
Ashby (1960, section 11/5) offers three simple strategies for dealing with the same basic exercise-problem, which have very different efficiencies. Suppose a collection of 1000 on/off switches have to be set to a particular combination by random-based testing, where each test is expected to take one second. [This is also discussed in Traill (1978–2006, section C1.2]. The strategies are:
*the perfectionist all-or-nothing method, with no attempt at holding partial successes. This would be expected to take more than 10^301 seconds, [i.e., 2^1000 seconds, or 3·5×(10^291) centuries]
*a serial-test of switches, holding on to the partial successes (assuming that these are manifest), which would take 500 seconds on average
* parallel-but-individual testing of all switches simultaneously, which would take only one second

Note the tacit assumption here that no intelligence or insight is brought to bear on the problem. However, the existence of different available strategies allows us to consider a separate (&quot;superior&quot;) domain of processing — a &quot;meta-level&quot; above the mechanics of switch handling — where the various available strategies can be randomly chosen. Once again this is &quot;trial and error&quot;, but of a different type.

===Hierarchies===
Ashby&#x27;s book develops this &quot;meta-level&quot; idea, and extends it into a whole recursive sequence of levels, successively above each other in a systematic hierarchy. On this basis, he argues that human intelligence emerges from such organization: relying heavily on trial-and-error (at least initially at each new stage), but emerging with what we would call &quot;intelligence&quot; at the end of it all. Thus presumably the topmost level of the hierarchy (at any stage) will still depend on simple trial-and-error.

Traill (1978–2006) suggests that this Ashby-hierarchy probably coincides with Piaget&#x27;s well-known theory of developmental stages. [This work also discusses Ashby&#x27;s 1000-switch example; see §C1.2]. After all, it is part of Piagetian doctrine that children learn first by &quot;actively doing&quot; in a more-or-less random way, and then hopefully learn from the consequences — which all has a certain resemblance to Ashby&#x27;s random &quot;trial-and-error&quot;.

===Application===
Traill (2008, &quot;espec. Table &quot;S&quot; on p.31&quot;) follows Jerne and Popper in seeing this strategy as probably underlying &quot;all&quot; knowledge-gathering systems — &quot;at least in their initial phase&quot;.

Four such systems are identified:
*Natural selection which &quot;educates&quot; the DNA of the species,
*The brain of the individual (just discussed);
*The &quot;brain&quot; of society-as-such (including the publicly held body of science); and
*The adaptive immune system.

==Features==
Trial and error has a number of features:
*solution-oriented: trial and error makes no attempt to discover &quot;why&quot; a solution works, merely that it &quot;is&quot; a solution.
*problem-specific: trial and error makes no attempt to generalize a solution to other problems.
*non-optimal: trial and error is generally an attempt to find &quot;a&quot; solution, not &quot;all&quot; solutions, and not the &quot;best&quot; solution.
*needs little knowledge: trials and error can proceed where there is little or no knowledge of the subject.

It is possible to use trial and error to find all solutions or the best solution, when a testably finite number of possible solutions exist. To find all solutions, one simply makes a note and continues, rather than ending the process, when a solution is found, until all solutions have been tried. To find the best solution, one finds all solutions by the method just described and then comparatively evaluates them based upon some predefined set of criteria, the existence of which is a condition for the possibility of finding a best solution. (Also, when only one solution can exist, as in assembling a jigsaw puzzle, then any solution found is the only solution and so is necessarily the best.)

==Examples==
Trial and error has traditionally been the main method of finding new drugs, such as antibiotics. Chemists simply try chemicals at random until they find one with the desired effect. In a more sophisticated version, chemists select a narrow range of chemicals it is thought may have some effect using a technique called structure–activity relationship. (The latter case can be alternatively considered as a changing of the problem rather than of the solution strategy: instead of &quot;What chemical will work well as an antibiotic?&quot; the problem in the sophisticated approach is &quot;Which, if any, of the chemicals in this narrow range will work well as an antibiotic?&quot;) The method is used widely in many disciplines, such as polymer technology to find new polymer types or families.

Trial and error is also commonly seen in player responses to video games - when faced with an obstacle or boss, players often form a number of strategies to surpass the obstacle or defeat the boss, with each strategy being carried out before the player either succeeds or quits the game.

Sports teams also make use of trial and error to qualify for and/or progress through the playoffs and win the championship, attempting different strategies, plays, lineups and formations in hopes of defeating each and every opponent along the way to victory. This is especially crucial in playoff series in which multiple wins are required to advance, where a team that loses a game will have the opportunity to try new tactics to find a way to win, if they are not eliminated yet.

The scientific method can be regarded as containing an element of trial and error in its formulation and testing of hypotheses. Also compare genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning – all varieties for search which apply the basic idea of trial and error.

Biological evolution can be considered as a form of trial and error. Random mutations and sexual genetic variations can be viewed as trials and poor reproductive fitness, or lack of improved fitness, as the error. Thus after a long time &#x27;knowledge&#x27; of well-adapted genomes accumulates simply by virtue of them being &quot;able&quot; to reproduce.

Bogosort, a conceptual sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), can be viewed as a trial and error approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of trial and error. Trial and error is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditions.

Jumping spiders of the genus &quot;Portia&quot; use trial and error to find new tactics against unfamiliar prey or in unusual situations, and remember the new tactics. Tests show that &quot;Portia fimbriata&quot; and &quot;Portia labiata&quot; can use trial and error in an artificial environment, where the spider&#x27;s objective is to cross a miniature lagoon that is too wide for a simple jump, and must either jump then swim or only swim.

<doc id="245765" wikidata="Q1508351" url="?curid=245765" title="The Jayhawks">
<text>The Jayhawks are an American alternative country and country rock band that emerged from the Twin Cities music scene in the mid-1980s. Led by vocalists/guitarists/songwriters Gary Louris and Mark Olson, their country rock sound was influential on many bands who played the Twin Cities circuit during the 1980s and 1990s, such as Uncle Tupelo, the Gear Daddies and the Honeydogs. They have released eleven studio albums, with and without Olson (who left the band for the first time in 1995), including five on the American Recordings label. After going on hiatus from 2005 to 2009, the 1995 lineup of the band reunited and released the album &quot;Mockingbird Time&quot; in September 2011; Olson left the band for the second time after the tour to promote the album. After another hiatus in 2013, the 1997 lineup led by Louris reunited to play shows in 2014 to support the reissue of three albums originally released between 1997 and 2003. Since then, the band has continued to tour and record, releasing the albums &quot;Live at The Belly Up&quot; in 2015; &quot;Paging Mr. Proust&quot;, co-produced by Peter Buck and Tucker Martine, in 2016; &quot;Back Roads and Abandoned Motels&quot; in 2018; and &quot;XOXO&quot; in 2020.

==History==
===Founding years and early success (1984–1995)===
The Jayhawks was formed in 1984 by Minneapolis musicians Mark Olson (guitar and vocals) and Caleb Palmiter (bass), with the duo adding Tommy Rey (drums) for its first shows. In 1985 the short-lived trio was relaunched as a four-piece band after Olson recruited Steve Retzler (guitar), Marc Perlman (bass), and Norm Rogers (drums). Later that year Gary Louris (guitar and vocals) replaced Retzler.

Their first album, &quot;The Jayhawks&quot;, was released by Bunkhouse Records, a small independent label, in 1986. Their music at the time, mostly written by Olson, showed a strong roots/country rock influence. Rogers left and was replaced by Thad Spencer, and the band worked for the next years on demo tapes in search of a major label recording contract. During this period, Louris left the band briefly (following a car accident) and Dan Gaarder replaced him. Louris returned, and the collected demos from 1986 to 1989 were brought together to create &quot;Blue Earth&quot;, released on the Minneapolis label Twin Tone in 1989. On this album Louris shared more of the songwriting with Olson. After touring the U.S. in support of &quot;Blue Earth&quot;, Spencer left the band and was replaced in 1988 by Ken Callahan, who stayed with the band until 1993.

In 1991, Dave Ayers, the head of A&amp;R for Twin Tone, was on a phone call with A&amp;R representative George Drakoulias of Def American while &quot;Blue Earth&quot; played in the background. Drakoulias asked about the music and eventually met with and signed the band to the label later that year.

In 1992 the Jayhawks had their major label release, &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot;, on Def American. The album was produced by Drakoulias and recorded primarily in Los Angeles and at Pachyderm Recording Studio in Minnesota. Though Louris&#x27;s fuzzy guitar was at the forefront, a clear folksy influence was also emerging in Olson and Louris&#x27;s songwriting. The album was successful, powered by the single &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, and it brought the Jayhawks a wider fan base. Adding Karen Grotberg on keyboards and vocals, the band toured extensively.

That year Olson, Louris and Perlman, along with Olson&#x27;s longtime friend and future collaborator in the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, Mike Russell, were recruited by Joe Henry as the backing band for his album &quot;Short Man&#x27;s Room&quot; and its 1993 followup, &quot;Kindness of the World.&quot;

In 1995 they went into the studio to produce &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; on the renamed American Recordings label. The lead track, &quot;Blue&quot;, was a Top 40 hit in Canada (peaking at No. 33), but the record&#x27;s production had been very expensive and the album failed to sell as expected in the U.S. Among the album&#x27;s songs is &quot;Miss Williams&#x27; Guitar&quot;, a love song for Olson&#x27;s then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter Victoria Williams (the pair later married, but divorced in February 2006). Drummer, singer and songwriter Tim O&#x27;Reagan joined the band for the 1995 tour; session drummer Don Heffington had played on the album.

===Middle years (1995–2004)===
By the end of 1995, Olson unexpectedly left the band to spend more time with Williams (with whom he would later form the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers). The band continued to record as the Jayhawks, adding Kraig Johnson on guitar. Johnson, another Minneapolis musical fixture, had played in the seminal SST band Run Westy Run, Iffy and Golden Smog.

The Jayhawks released &quot;Sound of Lies&quot; in 1997, with Louris composing most of the songs and allowing all of his influences a share in the proceedings. The result mixed straight rock (the ironic &quot;Big Star&quot;), psychedelic, acoustic (the title track) and even some dub elements, taking the band far from its country-influenced origins.

&quot;Smile&quot; (2000), produced by Bob Ezrin, had more of a pop music feel (which utilized new sounds for the band, like drum loops and synthesizers), jarring some of the band&#x27;s long-time fans. The &quot;New York Times&quot; positively reviewed the album, but in a nod to the band&#x27;s lack of widespread recognition, titled the review &quot;What If You Made a Classic and No One Cared?&quot; Though still a member through the recording of the album, a pregnant Grotberg left the band before the &quot;Smile&quot; tour and was replaced by Jen Gunderman. The song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; appeared in a Ralph Lauren commercial, the second soundtrack released from Dawson&#x27;s Creek &quot;Songs from Dawson&#x27;s Creek Volume 2&quot;, and the 2001 film &quot;All Over the Guy&quot;.

&quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; (2003), was stripped down, more acoustic, and generally seen as a return to their alt-country roots (&quot;Tailspin,&quot; &quot;Stumbling Through the Dark,&quot; &quot;You Look So Young&quot;). The band now consisted of founding members Louris and Perlman, along with drummer O&#x27;Reagan and touring band member ex-Long Ryder Stephen McCarthy, from Richmond, Virginia, who also played with Johnny Hott and the Piedmont Surprise. McCarthy added pedal steel, lap steel, banjo, guitar and backing vocals to the album and subsequent live shows. This lineup toured in 2003 and early 2004, including their first appearance on PBS&#x27;s long-running series Austin City Limits. The band&#x27;s final show was in Valencia, Spain.

In addition to their studio albums, the Jayhawks released &quot;Live from the Women&#x27;s Club&quot;, an all-acoustic live recording of Louris, Perlman and O&#x27;Reagan from 2002. It was sold only at concerts as an &quot;Official Jayhawks Bootleg.&quot; It includes the demo of the original version of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;, called &quot;Someone Will&quot;, and a cover of David Wiffen&#x27;s &quot;(Lost My) Driving Wheel&quot;, originally popularized by Tom Rush. A follow-up, &quot;Live from the Women&#x27;s Club 2&quot;, contains the rest of the concert, including a cover of Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; and a rendition of &quot;Jennifer Save Me&quot; from Golden Smog, the alt/country supergroup of which Louris was a founding member (and which Perlman later joined).

===Hiatus (2004–2009)===

Both old and new Jayhawks members progressed to solo efforts and side projects, and the band as a whole was generally considered to be broken up and not expected to produce new material soon. However, the band members appeared to have kept in touch, tour together in their other projects, and reunited on occasion. Olson and Louris toured together in the winter of 2005 and spring of 2006, billed as &quot;From the Jayhawks: An Evening with Mark Olson &amp; Gary Louris, Together Again.&quot;

In September 2008, the 1995 lineup of Louris, Olson, O&#x27;Reagan, Grotberg and Perlman reunited briefly for the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

In January 2009, Olson and Louris released an acoustic album, &quot;Ready for the Flood&quot;.

=== Aftermath (2009–present) ===

In April 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the Jayhawks had reunited. The band&#x27;s mid-1990s lineup played two shows that summer, one at Barcelona&#x27;s Primavera Sound Festival on May 30 and one at Minneapolis&#x27;s Basilica Block Party on July 10. Band co-leader Louris told &quot;Billboard&quot; that the reunion would be a part-time thing: &quot;I think the plan is that we&#x27;re going to play festivals. Next year, we&#x27;re hoping to play Bonnaroo and things like that. We&#x27;ll see if it grows from there.&quot;

In July 2009, Sony Legacy and American Recordings released &quot;Music from the North Country, The Jayhawks Anthology&quot;, a project supervised by Louris. The standard CD features highlights from the band&#x27;s studio albums, while a deluxe version adds rarities, B-sides, and unreleased material, as well as a DVD of the band&#x27;s music videos.

On May 18, 2010, the initial release &quot;The Jayhawks&quot; was digitally remastered from reel-to-reel and reissued on Lost Highway Records. The re-release features an eleven-page booklet designed by Olson. In fall 2010, the Jayhawks returned to the recording studio, planning to have a new album out by spring or early summer 2011.

In January 2011, Legacy Recordings reissued collector&#x27;s editions of both &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass,&quot; each featuring outtakes and B-sides. &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; features a second disc, entitled &quot;The Mystery Demos,&quot; featuring tracks from two recording sessions with Olson and Louris in 1992. Prior to the release of &quot;The Mystery Demos&quot;, several of the featured tracks had been re-recorded and released on various Jayhawks related albums, such as Olson&#x27;s solo release, &quot;The Salvation Blues&quot; and the Olson–Louris collaboration &quot;Ready for the Flood.&quot; To celebrate the release of the reissues, the Jayhawks—Louris, Olson, Perlman, Grotberg, and O&#x27;Reagan—launched a concert mini-tour in January 2011, with shows in Toronto (January 18), New York City (January 20 and 21), Philadelphia (January 22), Chicago (January 27 and 28), and Minneapolis (January 29). For the January 20 show at New York&#x27;s Webster Hall, the band performed &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; in its entirety, followed by the complete &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; the following evening.

In 2011 the band reunited again and recorded a new studio album. The lineup consisted of Olson, Louris, Perlman, Grotberg, and O&#x27;Reagan, and, as Louris said, &quot;Our goal is to make the best Jayhawks album that&#x27;s ever been done&quot;. Eighteen songs were recorded, 16 of them new, but only 12 made it to the final release. The album, &quot;Mockingbird Time&quot;, was released September 20. From 2009 to 2012 this lineup performed over 100 shows in North America and Europe before once again going on hiatus in the fall of 2012.

2014 saw new activity from the band once again. The final phase of the career-spanning reissue project started in 2009 commenced in the summer of 2014 with the reissue (on CD and LP) of the three albums the band made after Olson left in 1995: &quot;Sound of Lies&quot; (1997), &quot;Smile&quot; (2000) and &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; (2003). The reissues, on American Recordings/UME, feature bonus tracks, new liner notes and fresh remastering from original analog sources by Vic Anesini. Deluxe two-LP vinyl editions were also released; this was the first vinyl release in the U.S. of &quot;Smile&quot; and the first time vinyl copies of &quot;Sound of Lies&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; had been available after having been long out of print. Most of the 1997 touring lineup (Louris, Perlman, O&#x27;Reagan, Grotberg and Johnson) toured in 2014 and 2015 to support the reissues, concentrating on material from the 1997–2004 era of the band that had largely gone unplayed in concert for over a decade. The band released &quot;Live at the Belly-Up,&quot; a digital-only album on April 7, 2015.

The band announced in September 2015 that they were recording a new studio album with the 2014–2015 lineup. The album was recorded in Portland, Oregon, with Peter Buck from R.E.M and Tucker Martine producing. In January 2016 The Jayhawks announced on their Tumblr account that their new album would be titled &quot;Paging Mr. Proust&quot; and it was released on April 29, 2016 on Thirty Tigers. Kraig Johnson left the band again before the release of &quot;Paging Mr. Proust&quot;. Jeff &quot;Chet&quot; Lyster was added as a touring member on guitar, pedal steel and background vocals prior to the 2016 tour.

The band collaborated with Ray Davies, formerly of The Kinks, for an album released in April, 2017 titled &quot;Americana&quot;, based on Davies&#x27; experiences in the USA.

The Jayhawks also backed Wesley Stace on his 2017 album &quot;Wesley Stace&#x27;s John Wesley Harding&quot;.

Norm Rogers, the band&#x27;s drummer from 1984 to 1988, died on February 19, 2018.

2018 saw The Jayhawks backing Ray Davies again on his album &quot;Our Country - Americana Act II&quot; (released June 2018) as well as releasing their own album &quot;Back Roads and Abandoned Motels&quot; (July 2018). The band also recorded &quot;What Would I Dreamer Do?&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Forever Words&quot;, setting lyrics by Johnny Cash to music for the first time.

On July 13, 2018 the Jayhawks released &quot;Back Roads and Abandoned Motels&quot; on Sony Legacy Recordings label, featuring new fifth member John Jackson, who co-produced the album and served previously as a touring member on some tour dates since 2014.

The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

In 2020, the core lineup of Louris, Perlman, O&#x27;Reagan, and Grotberg released the new album, &quot;XOXO&quot;, that featured songwriting and lead vocals from each member of the band. Previous / part-time members John Jackson and Stephen McCarthy recorded on select songs, as well. The band appeared on the CBS This Morning: Saturday national morning show on June 27, 2020. The band resumed touring in 2021, with multiple dates on the Fall 2021 tour featuring McCarthy in the performing lineup for just the second time in 17 years.

<doc id="245772" wikidata="Q1730032" url="?curid=245772" title="Wilberforce University">
<text>Wilberforce University is a private historically black university in Wilberforce, Ohio. Affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), it was the first college to be owned and operated by African Americans. Central State University, also in Wilberforce, Ohio, began as a department of Wilberforce University. The college was founded in 1856 to provide classical education and teacher training for black youth. It was named for the English statesman William Wilberforce, who achieved the end of the slave trade in the British Empire.

The outbreak of the American Civil War (1861–65) caused the college to close in 1862 because of reduced enrollment and financial losses. The AME Church purchased the institution in 1863, and Bishop Daniel Payne was president, the first African American to become a college president in the United States. In the late 19th century, Wilberforce enlarged its mission to include black students from South Africa.

==History==
Wilberforce College was founded to educate African-American students. Twenty years earlier, a similar plan in New Haven, Connecticut, was met with a near-riot (New Haven Excitement), and was quickly abandoned. (See Simeon Jocelyn.) In the 19th century, discrimination against Blacks was legal, and the white colleges that would accept Black students could be counted on one hand (Grinnell College, Iowa (1879, first graduate); Hillsdale College, Michigan; the Oneida Institute; the Oberlin Collegiate Institute (later Oberlin College); and New-York Central College).

Located three miles (5 km) from the county seat of Xenia, Ohio in the southwestern part of the state, what developed as Wilberforce University was founded as a collaboration among leaders of the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church). They planned to promote classical education and teacher training for black youth. Among the first 24 members of the tri-racial board of trustees in 1855 were Bishop Daniel A. Payne, Lewis Woodson, Ishmael Keith, and Alfred Anderson, all of the AME Church. Also on the Board were Salmon P. Chase, then Governor of Ohio and a strong supporter of abolition; a member of the Ohio State Legislature, and other Methodist leaders from the white community. They named the college after the British abolitionist and statesman William Wilberforce. Rev Campbell Maxwell later became a trustee in 1896.

As a base for the college, the Cincinnati Conference bought a hotel, cottages and of a former resort property near Xenia. It was named Tawawa House after the springs in the area, a word derived from a Shawnee term for &quot;clear or golden water&quot;. This color was associated with the natural springs nearby because of its high iron content. White people had founded the health resort in 1851 because of the springs, which they also called Yellow Springs. The waters had long been reputed to have health benefits.

Because of its location, this resort area had attracted summer people from both Cincinnati and the South, particularly after completion of the Little Miami Railroad in 1846. Some people in this area of abolitionist sentiment were shocked when wealthy white Southern planters patronized the resort with their entourages of enslaved African-American mistresses and mixed-race &quot;natural&quot; children.

Given migration patterns, this was also an area where numerous free people of color settled, many having moved across the Ohio River from the South to find better work and living conditions. Some were pushed from Southern states, which often required newly manumitted individuals to leave within a certain time period. Xenia had quite a large free black population, as did other towns in southern Ohio, such as Chillicothe, Yellow Springs and Zanesville. Free blacks and anti-slavery white supporters used houses in Xenia as stations on the Underground Railroad in the years before the Civil War. Wilberforce College also supported freedom-seeking slaves. Many of these free people of color were also had Native ancestry, Daniel Payne himself being of Catawba descent.

The college opened for classes in 1856, and by 1858 its trustees selected Richard S. Rust as the first president. Overriding some protest by men, in the 1850s the college hired Frances E. W. Harper, an abolitionist poet, as the first woman to teach at the school. In 1859 Sarah Jane Woodson began to teach at Wilberforce. She was a 1856 graduate of Oberlin College. She was the youngest sister of one of the original trustees, Lewis Woodson. She was the first black American to teach at a historically black college or university. She returned to Wilberforce in 1866 after it reopened in a position of greater responsibility.

By 1860 the private university had more than 200 students. It is notable that most were from the South, the &quot;natural&quot; mixed-race sons and daughters of wealthy white planters and their enslaved African-American mistresses. The fathers paid for the educations that were denied their children in the South. They were among the fathers who did not abandon their mixed-race children but provided them with the social capital of education and sometimes property.

The outbreak of the Civil War threatened the college&#x27;s finances. The Southern planters withdrew their children, and no more paying students came from the South. The Methodist church said it had to divert its resources to support the war. The college closed temporarily in 1862 when the Cincinnati Methodist Church was unable to fund it fully.

Led by Bishop Daniel A. Payne, in 1863 the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) decided to buy the college to ensure its survival; they paid the cost of its debt. They sold another property to raise the money. Founders were Bishop Payne, who was selected as its president; James A. Shorter, pastor of the AME Church in Zanesville, Ohio and a future bishop; and John G. Mitchell, principal of the Eastern District Public School of Cincinnati. Payne was the first African American to become a college president in the United States.

When an arson fire damaged some of the buildings in 1865, Payne went to his network to appeal for aid in rebuilding the college. Salmon P. Chase, then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and Charles Avery from Pittsburgh each contributed $10,000 to rebuild the college. Mary E. Monroe, another white supporter, contributed $4200. In addition, the US Congress approved a $25,000 grant for the college, which raised additional monies privately from a wide range of donors.

In 1888 the AME Church came to an agreement with the Republican Party-dominated state legislature that brought considerable financial support and political patronage to the college. It negotiated contemporary pressures to emphasize industrial education for many black youth by accommodating both that and the classical education.

As an act of political patronage, the state legislature established a commercial, normal and industrial (CNI) department at Wilberforce College. While this created complications for administration and questions about the mission of the college, in the near term it brought tens of thousands of dollars annually in state aid to the campus. Each state legislator could award an annual scholarship to the CNI department at Wilberforce, enabling hundreds of African-American students to attend classes. The state-funded students could complete liberal arts at the college, and students at Wilberforce could also take &quot;industrial&quot; classes.

By the mid-1890s, the college also admitted students from South Africa, as part of the AME Church&#x27;s mission to Africa. The church helped support such students with scholarships, as well as arranging board with local families. An 1898 report published by the AME Church listed the university as having 20 faculty, 334 students, and 246 graduates.

The college became a center of black cultural and intellectual life in southwestern Ohio. Because the area did not receive many European immigrants, blacks had more opportunities at diverse work. Xenia and nearby towns developed a professional black elite.

Generations of leaders: teachers, ministers, doctors, politicians and college administrators, and later men and women of all occupations, have been educated at the university. In the 19th century, Bishop Payne established his dream, a theological seminary, which was named in his honor. Top-ranking scholars taught at the college, including W.E.B. Du Bois, the philologist William S. Scarborough, Edward Clarke, and John G. Mitchell, dean of the seminary. In 1894 Lieutenant Charles Young, the third black graduate of West Point and at the time the only African-American commissioned officer in the US Army, led the newly established military science department.

Additional leading scholars taught at the college in the early 20th century, such as Theophilus Gould Steward, a politician, theologian and missionary; and the sociologist Richard R. Wright, Jr., the first African American to earn a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. He was a future AME bishop and became president of Wilberforce. These men were also prominent in the American Negro Academy, founded in 1897 to support the work of scholars, writers and other intellectuals. In 1969 the organization was revived as the Black Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 1941, the normal/industrial department was expanded by development of a four-year curriculum. In 1947, this section was split from the university and given independent status. It was renamed as Central State College in 1951. With further development of programs and departments, in 1965 it achieved university status as Central State University.

Growth of Wilberforce University after the mid-20th century led to construction of a new campus in 1967, located one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1974, the area was devastated by an F5 tornado that was part of the 1974 Super Outbreak, which destroyed much of the city of Xenia and the old campus of Wilberforce.

Older campus buildings still in use include the Carnegie Library, built in 1909 with matching funds from the Carnegie Foundation, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places; Shorter Hall, built in 1922; and the Charles Leander Hill Gymnasium, built in 1958. The former residence of Charles Young near Wilberforce was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the US Department of Interior, in recognition of his significant and groundbreaking career in the US Army.

In the 1970s, the university established the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, to provide exhibits and outreach to the region. It is now operated by the Ohio Historical Society. The university also supports the national Association of African American Museums, to provide support and professional guidance especially to smaller museums across the country.

In 2021 the university announced it was cutting tuition by 15% for Ohio residents.

===2008 Financial aid audit===
In 2008 the US Department of Education, Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed an audit of financial management, specifically the university&#x27;s management of Title IV funds, which related to its work-study program. For the two-year audit period (2004–2005, 2005–2006) the audit found numerous faults. In summary, the OIG found that the university did not comply with Title IV, HEA requirements because of administrative problems, including staff turnover, insufficient financial aid staff, failure to have written procedures, and lack of communication with other offices. The university worked with auditors to set up appropriate staff and procedures.

===Presidents===
==Academics==
According to &quot;US News and World Report&quot;, Wilberforce had a 7% graduation rate within the standard four-year period of study in 2024, making it one of the least successful universities in the world.

===Cooperative education===
Wilberforce requires all students to participate in cooperative education to meet graduation requirements. The cooperative program places students in internships that provide practical work experience in addition to academic training. It has been a required part of the curriculum at Wilberforce since 1966.

===NASA SEMAA project===
In October 2006, Wilberforce held the grand opening and dedication for the NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA) and the associated Aerospace Education Laboratory (AEL). It was attended by Bernice G. Alston, deputy assistant administrator of NASA&#x27;s office of Education, and Dave Hobson, U.S. Representative from Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district.

==Athletics==
The Wilberforce athletic teams are called the Bulldogs. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as a member of the HBCU Athletic Conference since the 2024-2025 academic year. They previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Continental Athletic Conference during the 2023–24 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 2012–13 to 2021–22. The Bulldogs competed in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) during the 2022–23 school year, and in the defunct American Mideast Conference from 1999–2000 to 2011–12.

Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, spirit teams and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor).

===Intramurals===
Students also participate in the following intramural sports: basketball, softball, volleyball, flag football, and tennis.

<doc id="245775" wikidata="Q374192" url="?curid=245775" title="Aureola">
<text>An aureola or aureole (diminutive of Latin &quot;aurea&quot;, &quot;golden&quot;) is the radiance of luminous cloud which, in paintings of sacred personages, surrounds the whole figure.

In Romance languages, the noun Aureola is usually more related to the disc of light surrounding the head of sacred figures, which in English is called halo or nimbus. In Indian religions, the back or head halo is called &quot;prabhāmaṇḍala&quot; or &quot;prabhavali&quot;.

==In art==
In the earliest periods of Christian art it was confined to the figures of the persons of the Christian Godhead, but it was afterwards extended to the Virgin Mary and to several of the saints.

The aureola, when enveloping the whole body, generally appears oval or elliptical in form, but occasionally depicted as circular, vesica piscis, or quatrefoil. When it appears merely as a luminous disk round the head, it is called specifically a &quot;halo&quot; or &quot;nimbus&quot;, while the combination of nimbus and aureole is called a &quot;glory&quot;. The strict distinction between nimbus and aureole is not commonly maintained, and the latter term is most frequently used to denote the radiance round the heads of saints, angels or Persons of the Trinity.

This is not to be confused with the specific &quot;motif&quot; in art of the Christ Child appearing to be a source of light in a Nativity scene. These depictions derive directly from the accounts given by Saint Bridget of Sweden of her visions, in which she describes seeing this.

===Development===
The nimbus in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same motif was known from several centuries earlier, in pre-Christian Hellenistic art. It is found in some Persian representations of kings and gods, and appears on coins of the Kushan kings Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva, as well as on most representations of the Buddha in Greco-Buddhist art from the 1st century AD. Its use has also been traced through the Egyptians to the ancient Greeks, representations of Trajan (arch of Constantine) and Antoninus Pius (reverse of a medal) being found with it. Roman emperors were sometimes depicted wearing a radiant crown, with pointed rays intended to represent the rays of the sun. 

In the circular form the nimbus constitutes a natural and even primitive use of the idea of a crown, modified by an equally simple idea of the emanation of light from the head of a superior being, or by the meteorological phenomenon of a halo. The probability is that all later associations with the symbol refer back to an early astrological origin (compare Mithras), the person so glorified being identified with the sun and represented in the sun&#x27;s image; so the aureole is the &quot;Hvareno&quot; of Mazdaism. From this early astrological use, the form of &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;nimbus&quot; has been adapted or inherited under new beliefs.

===Mandorla===
A &quot;mandorla&quot; is a vesica piscis shaped aureola which surrounds the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary in traditional Christian art. It is commonly used to frame the figure of Christ in Majesty in early medieval and Romanesque art, as well as Byzantine art of the same periods. The term refers to the almond like shape: &quot;mandorla&quot; means almond nut in Italian. In icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the Resurrection, Transfiguration, and the Ascension. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church&#x27;s use of Apophatic theology, as described by Dionysius the Areopagite and others. As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness, except by darkness.

In a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at Sant Climent de Taüll, the inscription &quot;Ego Sum Lux Mundi&quot; (&quot;I Am the Light of the World&quot;) is incorporated in the Mandorla design.

The tympanum at Conques has Christ, with a gesture carved in romanesque sculpture, indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the Moon. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the Sun.

In one special case, at Cervon (Nièvre), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers. At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers -the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. Here one is tempted to seek for reference in the symbolism of the nine branched Chanukkiyah candelabrum. In the 12th century a great school of Judaic thought radiated from Narbonne, coinciding with the origins of the Kabbalah. Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of Book of Revelation (22:16) (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete Hebrew Bible, the Leningrad Codex, one finds the Star of David imbedded in an octagon.)

In the symbolism of Hildegarde von Bingen the mandorla refers to the Cosmos.

==Aureole (atmospheric phenomenon)==

In meteorology, an aureole is the inner disk of a &quot;corona,&quot; an optical phenomenon produced by the diffraction of light from the Sun or the Moon (or, occasionally, other bright light sources) by individual small water droplets and sometimes tiny ice crystals of a cloud or on a foggy glass surface. The aureole is often (especially in case of the Moon) the only visible part of the corona and has the appearance of a bluish-white disk which fades to reddish-brown towards the edge.

<text>Agua Prieta (&quot;dark water&quot;) is a town in the Agua Prieta Municipality in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of Sonora. It stands on the Mexico–U.S. border, adjacent to the town of Douglas, Arizona. The municipality covers an area of 3,631.65 km2 (1,402.2 sq mi). In the 2010 census, the town had a population of 79,138 people, making it the seventh-largest community in the state, with a literacy rate of 96.3%.

The city&#x27;s most important economic activities, in descending order, are industry, commerce and farming. 89% of the homes in the city have electricity, 94% have running water, and 86% are connected to the sewer system. The city is the location of the CFE Agua Prieta power plant. It is connected to the United States by the Douglas, Arizona Port of Entry, and is linked to the rest of Mexico by Federal Highways 2 and 17.

The town&#x27;s name in Spanish literally means &#x27;dark water&#x27;, and it is known in the Opata language as .

==History==
Agua Prieta city began at the end of the 19th century as railroads were built between Douglas, Arizona, and Nacozari, Sonora, to transport minerals and goods. As a result, the first settlers of the city, then just a few blocks, were those employed by the U.S. mining company Phelps Dodge Corporation, which was based in Douglas, Arizona. One can say that the town was &quot;founded&quot; in 1899, but it was not until a &quot;contract&quot; was made in 1903 between officials and private citizens, to the name Camou, that area &quot;pertaining&quot; to those citizens was made a Commissary of Fronteras county. Agua Prieta city did not become an &quot;independent head of municipality&quot;, with its current name and location, until August 28, 1916. Rodolfo L. Márquez was the new municipality&#x27;s first president. It rose to the status of &quot;villa&quot; (town) on May 8, 1933, and it was &quot;officially&quot; placed in its current category of city relatively recently, on November 6, 1942.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
The climate is cold semi-arid (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). In a latitude over the geographic subtropics, located in a plateau and in the interior of the continent gives a cold winter but at the same time a climatic pattern often dry and with great thermal amplitude during the day. And on the other hand the summer is very hot due to the absence of cloud cover and the air dry with average in the afternoon well above 30 °C. Most of the time there is no precipitation, but a considerable amount of rain falls between July and August.

==Culture==
Los Apson was one of the most successful musical bands during the second half of the 60s; all original members originated from (A)gua (P)rieta, (Son)ora, hence their name. They led the phenomenon known in Mexico as the &quot;northern invasion&quot;. Along with the British influence, Los Apson was one of the main decisive elements that brought new nuances to the Mexican musical movement.

==Sports==
The main sport in Agua Prieta is baseball, closely followed by soccer and basketball. Agua Prieta&#x27;s professional baseball team is the Toros de Agua Prieta. In 2012, Agua Prieta had its first ever Olympian when Luis Alberto Rivera represented Mexico in the long jump at the XXX Olympic Games in London, UK.

==Economy==
Agua Prieta II is the first integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) power plant in Mexico – one of the first power plants of its type in the world – and it is being equipped with the SPPA-E3000 low-voltage switchgear solution from Siemens Mexico Energy. Agua Prieta II is a combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) that has been extended with a solar field and parabolic trough collectors. In this type of power plant, the steam generated by the solar field is fed into the water-steam cycle of the CCPP to increase steam turbine output and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The power plant in Mexico will have an output of approximately 465 Megawatts (MW) with a contribution from the solar field of 12 MW, it will supply electricity to northwest Mexico. The end customer is the Mexican state power provider Comisión Federal de Electricidad, which already operates two plants of the same type in Morocco and Algeria.

Agua Prieta is home to several maquiladoras, including Levolor, Commercial Vehicle Group, Joyson Safety Systems, Velcro, Standex-Meder Electronics, and Alstyle Apparel &amp; Activewear (Gildan).

==Politics==

The Plan of Agua Prieta was a political manifesto signed in the city of Agua Prieta on April 23, 1920, by the governor of Sonora, Adolfo de la Huerta, and Plutarco Elías Calles in support of Álvaro Obregón, with the principal objective of bringing an end to the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, who was forced to flee Mexico City and was killed a month later. The Plan of Agua Prieta used as its political banner the 1917 Constitution, with which Carranza had not complied. It also advocated the convening of elections, appointed Huerta as supreme commander of the Constitutionalist Army, and dictated the rules for electing a provisional president, resulting in Huerta being named president by Congress in June.

Agua Prieta played an important role in the Mexican Revolution. Plutarco Elías Calles and Lázaro Cárdenas, two future presidents of Mexico, both lived in the town during its early years. In 1914, the Hotel Central, a now-demolished hotel in the center of the city, was the seat of Carranza&#x27;s constitutional government. In 1915, Pancho Villa made a night attack on Agua Prieta that was repelled by the forces of Plutarco Elías Calles, assisted by large searchlights (possibly powered by American electricity). The Plan de Agua Prieta, a manifesto which called for the rejection of the government headed by Venustiano Carranza, was signed in a curiosity shop near the international border in 1920. The army headed by Álvaro Obregón eventually deposed Carranza.

<doc id="245786" wikidata="Q547700" url="?curid=245786" title="Mrs. Miller">
<text>Elva Ruby Miller (October 5, 1907 – July 5, 1997), who recorded under the name Mrs. Miller, was an American singer who gained some fame in the 1960s for her series of shrill and off-tempo renditions of popular songs such as &quot;Moon River&quot;, &quot;Monday, Monday&quot;, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Concerto&quot; and &quot;Downtown&quot;. An untrained mezzo-soprano, she sang in a heavy, vibrato-laden style; according to Irving Wallace, David Wallechinsky and Amy Wallace in &quot;The Book of Lists 2,&quot; Miller&#x27;s voice was compared to the sound of &quot;roaches scurrying across a trash can lid.&quot;

Nevertheless, &quot;Downtown&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in April 1966, peaking at No. 82. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Concerto&quot;, also cracked the Hot 100 that same month at No. 95.

==Life and career==
Elva Ruby Connes was born in Joplin, Missouri, the third of seven children born to Edward and Ada (Martin) Connes, and was raised in Missouri and Kansas. She married John Richardson Miller, a professional investor 30 years her senior, on January 17, 1934. They moved to Claremont, California the following year, where she studied music, voice and composition at Pomona College and involved herself in church and community projects.
She said that singing was merely a hobby, but she produced several records, mainly of classical, gospel and children&#x27;s songs. She self-financed and recorded at least one 45’ (&quot;Slumber Song&quot;), and distributed it to local orphanages. Arranger Fred Bock heard her recording and convinced her to try more modern songs, after which he presented the recordings to multiple record labels.

Miller was discovered by radio disc jockey (and later &quot;Laugh-In&quot; announcer) Gary Owens, who first featured Miller on his radio program in 1960. Owens also included her on a limited-run album of his comedy routines. In 1965, Miller was signed to Capitol Records by young producer Lex de Azevedo.

Miller&#x27;s success, as with that of Florence Foster Jenkins before her and Wing after her, was largely attributable to the amateurish quality of her singing. Capitol Records seemed eager to emphasize it; in a 1967 interview with &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Miller claimed that during recording sessions, she was deliberately conducted one half beat ahead of or behind time, and that the songs on the finished album represented the worst take from each song&#x27;s set of recordings. Her first LP, with the tongue-in-cheek title &quot;Mrs. Miller&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, was issued by Capitol in 1966. Composed entirely of well-known pop standards, it sold more than 250,000 copies in its first three weeks. Owens wrote the album&#x27;s liner notes. &quot;Will Success Spoil Mrs. Miller?!&quot; followed, and &quot;The Country Soul of Mrs. Miller&quot; came a year later.

Miller sang for American servicemen in Vietnam, performed at the Hollywood Bowl and appeared on numerous television talk and variety shows. She also appeared in Roddy McDowall&#x27;s film &quot;The Cool Ones&quot;, in which she sang &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;. Eventually, public interest in Miller began to wane, and Capitol Records dropped her from its roster in 1968. She released one album, &quot;Mrs. Miller Does Her Thing&quot;, on the small Amaret Records label, before issuing several singles on her own Vibrato Records label. She recorded two albums of material at Radio Recorders studios in Hollywood that were issued by Dunhill Records, which went largely unnoticed. Her last known recording was a 1971 self-released EP.

Miller officially retired in 1973, by which time interest in her career had virtually disappeared. She spent her remaining years working for various charities. She lived in a condo in Northridge, California until the earthquake in 1994, and she then moved to a retirement home.

Miller may have been the inspiration for a similar act called Mr. Miller and the Blue Notes, who released a version of the Herman&#x27;s Hermits hit &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot; in 1966.

==Death==
Elva Miller died at the Garden Terrace Retirement Center in Vista, California in 1997 at the age of 89. She was interred at the Pomona Mausoleum at Pomona Valley Memorial Park in Pomona, California. Two years later, a compilation CD of her work was released on Capitol&#x27;s Ultra-Lounge label titled &quot;Wild, Cool &amp; Swingin&#x27;: The Artist Collection Volume Three.&quot;

<doc id="245787" wikidata="Q990001" url="?curid=245787" title="Heroica Nogales">
<text>Heroica Nogales (), more commonly known as Nogales, is a city and the county seat of the Municipality of Nogales in the Mexican state of Sonora. It is located in the north of the state across the U.S.-Mexico border, and is abutted on its north by the city of Nogales, Arizona. 

The name Nogales is the Spanish term for &quot;walnut trees.&quot; The municipality had a population of 264,782 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The independent Nogales Municipality, which included the town of Nogales, was established on July 11, 1884. The Nogales Municipality covers an area of 1,675 km2. Nogales was declared a city within the Municipality on January 1, 1920.

===Battle of Ambos Nogales===
The international trade that existed between Heroica Nogales and Nogales, Arizona greatly propelled the economic development of Heroica Nogales, and the greater Northern Sonora region, but that did not prevent significant problems from forming in the area after the outbreak of the 1910 Mexican Revolution.
On August 27, 1918, at about 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without checking in at the U.S. Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the U.S. Border Patrol did not exist until 1924). For the Americans, the reinforcements were 10th Cavalry and 35th Infantry soldiers, and civilians. Hostilities quickly escalated and several soldiers were killed and others wounded on both sides. The mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, was killed when waving a white truce flag or handkerchief with his cane.

Due in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops it was claimed they led into battle. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales prior to the August 27, 1918 battle documented the departure of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels. Furthermore, an investigation by Army officials from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, could not substantiate accusations of militant German agents in the Mexican border community and instead traced the origins of the violence to the abuse of Mexican border crossers in the year prior to the Battle of Ambos Nogales. The main result of this battle was the building of the first permanent border fence between the two cities of Nogales. Though largely unheard of in the U.S. (and even within most of Mexico), the municipal leaders of Nogales, Sonora, successfully petitioned the Mexican Congress in 1961 to grant the Mexican border city the title of &quot;Heroic City&quot;, leading the community&#x27;s official name, Heroica Nogales, a distinction shared with the Sonoran cities of Guaymas, Caborca, and Ures, and a number of other cities in Mexico.

===Escobarista Rebellion===
Early in March 1929, the Escobarista Rebellion exploded in Nogales, sponsored by Obregonistas, supporters of Mexican president Álvaro Obregón, who had been assassinated on July 17, 1928. General Manuel Aguirre, commanding the rebellious 64th Regiment, took power without firing a shot, causing &quot;federales&quot; from Naco to send a daily airplane to attack the rebels. It dropped a few bombs over Nogales without doing any damage, while the rebels fought back with machine guns from the roofs without doing any damage to the airplane. There was only one casualty, a woman who was scared by a bomb explosion and had a heart attack. That same month, a hooded man appeared at night driving a tank on Morley Street on the U.S. side, then entered Mexico to help the &quot;federales&quot; in Naco. It seems that the tank had been bought in 1927 for fighting the Yaquis, but U.S. officials prohibited it from leaving the U.S., and it had been kept in a warehouse in Nogales, Arizona.

==Climate==

Nogales has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters, often presenting freezing temperatures.

==Demographics==
, the census reported that the City of Nogales had a population of 159,103 people, representing approximately 50% growth from 1990. By the 2005 census the official population of the city was 189,759, and that of Nogales Municipality was 193,517. At the latest census in 2020, the official numbers were 264,782 for the Municipality. As of 2020, 1,980 inhabitants spoke a Native language, with the Mayo language being the most spoken at 1,024 speakers. There were 2,410 documented immigrants living in Nogales in 2020, most of them from the United States (2,368). In that census, it was recorded that 71% of households had access to the internet and 95.6% of households had at least one cellphone. 46.8% of residents ages 15+ had an education of middle school or lower and the rest (53.2%) had a high school diploma/general baccalaureate or a college degree. This number has increased rapidly since the 2000 census. Nogales had the lowest rating on the Gender Inequality Index (0.33) of any municipality in Sonora, indicating higher gender equity than other places in the state. Just under 30% of inhabitants lived in poverty as of 2020, which is lower than Mexico&#x27;s average of 44.2%.

The city and the municipality both rank third in the state in population, after Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregón. The municipality includes many outlying but small rural communities. The only other localities with over 1,000 inhabitants are La Mesa (2,996) and Centro de Readaptación Social Nuevo (2,203) . Nogales is served by Nogales International Airport.

The population growth is in part due to the influx of industry that has come since the opening of the maquiladora industry through the National Industrialization Program, decades before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the 90s, this economic context was, in part, held by an important Sonora state social policy by the Secretary of Urban Infrastructure and Ecology, Vernon Perez Rubio, accomplishing the city&#x27;s total coverage on drinking water, with a 20-year guaranteed service. Manufacturing now accounts for 55% of the city&#x27;s gross domestic product, and services are growing as well, most of this caused by the growing jobs in the city. 

Nogales has experienced enormous population growth which covers the hills along the central narrow north–south valley. Dispersed among the houses, the visitor will find a mixture of factories, stores, etc. In 2006, the southern half of the city experienced a modern urbanization development including shopping malls, wide avenues, and modern housing conglomerations.

==Monuments==
At the center of Nogales, there is the Plaza de Benito Juárez. Here there is a statue with two leading figures designed by Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just. This is a tribute to Mexican President Benito Juárez, and the other is the &quot;Monument to Ignorance&quot;, where a naked man who represents the Mexican people is fighting with a winged creature that represents ignorance.

==Economy==

===Transportation===
The primary commercial artery is Mexico Federal Highway 15, which links Nogales to major cities in Mexico as well as Interstate 19 at the U.S. border.

In aviation, the city is served by the Aeropuerto internacional de Nogales, which, had no commercial airline service.

===Tourism===
Due to its location, Nogales is one of the most important ports of entry for U.S. tourists. The downtown area consists of bars, hotels, restaurants, and a large number of curio stores, which sell a large variety of artesanias (handicrafts, leather art, handmade flowers, clothes) brought from the deeper central and southern states of Mexico. Local dishes commonly available in restaurants include many types of antojitos (Mexican food) such as enchiladas, tacos, burritos with carne machaca (dried meat), menudo and tamales.

===Manufacturing===
Maquiladoras, or manufacturing plants, employ a large percentage of the population. Nogales&#x27; proximity to the U.S. and the abundance of inexpensive labor make it an efficient location for foreign companies to have manufacturing and assembly operations. Some of the companies that have established maquiladoras in Nogales include: Continental AG, Amphenol Corporation, The Chamberlain Group, Walbro, ABB, Javid LLC.

==== Production and export ====
Approximately 92 establishments produce foreign exports. Sixty-five of these establishments are located in seven industrial parks, which employ approximately 25,400 workers, around 50 percent of the total employed population of the municipality. Also important to the economy is livestock for both foreign export and cattle breeding.

==== Agriculture ====
Produce is one of Mexico&#x27;s largest exports to the United States and the Mariposa Port of entry, at Nogales, is the most widely used route for produce destined for the U.S. Currently, 37% of all produce imported from Mexico to the U.S. passes through Nogales, making Nogales the largest border crossing for Mexican fresh produce. In the winter, the percentage of U.S. imported vegetables passing through Nogales jumps up to about 60%. In 2020, an estimated $3.7 billion worth of fresh produce entered the U.S. through Nogales, with significant portions originating from the Western Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa. As of 2021, in descending order of volume, the top commodities shipped through Nogales were tomatoes (19%), watermelon (16%), cucumbers (14%), squash (13%), bell peppers (9%), grapes (6%), chili peppers (5%), mangos (4%), honeydew melon (2%) and eggplant (2%). Going the other way, the Nogales Arizona-Nogales Sonora Port of Entry was the fourth-largest crossing point for U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico in 2020, with $1.05 billion worth of fresh fruits (34%), grains (26%), meat and meat products (9%), and fresh vegetables (8%) transported by truck and rail.

The produce industry requires facilities for the storage, packing, transport and logistics of these goods and provides many with employment on both sides of the border. November through March represent peak harvesting season and it is during these months when jobs are abundant and importation is at its highest.

== Government ==
The municipality of Nogales was governed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) from 1931 to 2006, when power shifted to the National Action Party (PAN). After more than seven decades of being in power, the PRI was defeated by the PAN when the businessman and philanthropist Marco Antonio Martínez Dabdoub ran for the presidency of Nogales, and gained access to the municipal government after having won by 30,826 votes against 23,892 of his PRI opponent.

==Gallery==
== Religion ==
Since 13 March 2015, its Catedral Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is also the episcopal cathedral see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nogales. It is a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Hermosillo, from which its diocesan territory was split off.

== In popular culture ==
Nogales is discussed at length in the popular political economics book &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot;, comparing the relative success of Nogales, Arizona, north of the border to the poverty of Nogales, Sonora, to the south.

<text>The ankh or key of life is an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol used to represent the word for &quot;life&quot; and, by extension, as a symbol of life itself.

The ankh has a T-shape topped by a droplet-shaped loop. It was used in writing as a triliteral sign, representing a sequence of three consonants, &quot;Ꜥ-n-ḫ&quot;. This sequence was found in several Egyptian words, including the terms for &quot;mirror&quot;, &quot;floral bouquet&quot;, and &quot;life&quot;. The symbol often appeared in Egyptian art as a physical object representing either life or related life-giving substances such as air or water. Commonly depicted in the hands of ancient Egyptian deities, sometimes being given by them to the pharaoh, it represents their power to sustain life and to revive human souls in the afterlife.

The ankh was a widespread decorative motif in ancient Egypt, also used decoratively by neighbouring cultures. Copts adapted it into the &quot;crux ansata&quot;, a shape with a circular rather than droplet loop, and used it as a variant of the Christian cross. The ankh came into widespread use in Western culture in the 1960s, appearing as a symbol of African cultural identity, Neopagan belief systems, and later, the goth subculture.

==Use in writing==

In ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, the ankh was a triliteral sign: one that represented a sequence of three consonant sounds. The ankh stood for the sequence &quot;Ꜥ-n-ḫ&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is pronounced like the English letter &quot;n&quot;, &quot;Ꜥ&quot; is a voiced pharyngeal fricative, and &quot;ḫ&quot; is a voiceless or voiced velar fricative (sounds not found in English). In the Egyptian language, these consonants were found in the verb meaning &quot;live&quot;, the noun meaning &quot;life&quot;, and words derived from them, such as &quot;sꜤnḫ&quot;, which means &quot;cause to live&quot; or &quot;nourish&quot;; &quot;Ꜥnḫ&quot; evolved into ⲱⲛϩ (&quot;onh&quot;) in the Coptic stage of the language. The sign is known in English as the &quot;ankh&quot;, based on the hypothetical pronunciation of the Egyptian word, or as the &quot;key of life&quot;, based on its meaning.

One of the common uses of the word &quot;Ꜥnḫ&quot; was to express a wish that a particular person live. For example, a phrase meaning something like &quot;may you be healthy and alive&quot; was used in polite contexts, similar to the English phrase &quot;if you please&quot;, and the phrase &quot;Ꜥnḫ wḏꜣ snb&quot;, meaning &quot;alive, sound, and healthy&quot;, was used as an honorific for the pharaoh when he was mentioned in writing. The Egyptian word for &quot;oath&quot; was also &quot;Ꜥnḫ&quot;, because oaths in ancient Egypt began with a form of the word &quot;live&quot;.

The same consonants were found in the word for &quot;mirror&quot; and the word for a floral bouquet, so the sign was also used in writing these words. The three consonants also compose the word for a looped rope-like object found in illustrations on many coffins from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2050–1650 BC). The Egyptologists Battiscombe Gunn and Alan Gardiner, in the early 20th century, believed these objects to be sandal straps, given that they appear in pairs at the foot of the coffin and the accompanying texts say the objects are &quot;on the ground under his feet&quot;.

==Origins==

Early examples of the ankh sign date to the First Dynasty (c. 30th to 29th century BC). There is little agreement on what physical object the sign originally represented. Many scholars believe the sign is a knot formed of a flexible material such as cloth or reeds, as early versions of the sign show the lower bar of the ankh as two separate lengths of flexible material that seem to correspond to the two ends of the knot. These early versions bear a resemblance to the &quot;tyet&quot; symbol, a sign that represented the concept of &quot;protection&quot;. For these reasons, the Egyptologists Heinrich Schäfer and Henry Fischer thought the two signs had a common origin, and they regarded the ankh as a knot that was used as an amulet rather than for any practical purpose.

Hieroglyphic writing used pictorial signs to represent sounds, so that, for example, the hieroglyph for a house could represent the sounds &quot;p-r&quot;, which were found in the Egyptian word for &quot;house&quot;. This practice, known as the rebus principle, allowed the Egyptians to write the words for things that could not be pictured, such as abstract concepts. Gardiner believed the ankh originated in this way. He pointed out that the sandal-strap illustrations on Middle Kingdom coffins resemble the hieroglyph, and he argued that the sign originally represented knots like these and came to be used in writing all other words that contained the consonants &quot;Ꜥ-n-ḫ&quot;. Gardiner&#x27;s list of hieroglyphic signs labels the ankh as S34, placing it within the category for items of clothing and just after S33, the hieroglyph for a sandal. Gardiner&#x27;s hypothesis persists; James P. Allen, in an introductory book on the Egyptian language published in 2014, assumes that the sign originally meant &quot;sandal strap&quot; and uses it as an example of the rebus principle in hieroglyphic writing.

Various authors have argued that the sign originally represented something other than a knot. Some have suggested that it had a sexual meaning. For instance, Thomas Inman, an amateur mythologist in the nineteenth century, thought the sign represented the male and female reproductive organs, joined into a single sign. Victor Loret, a nineteenth-century Egyptologist, argued that &quot;mirror&quot; was the sign&#x27;s original meaning. A problem with this argument, which Loret acknowledged, is that deities are frequently shown holding the ankh by its loop, and their hands pass through it where the solid reflecting surface of an ankh-shaped mirror would be. Andrew Gordon, an Egyptologist, and Calvin Schwabe, a veterinarian, argue that the origin of the ankh is related to two other signs of uncertain origin that often appear alongside it: the &quot;was&quot;-sceptre, representing &quot;power&quot; or &quot;dominion&quot;, and the &quot;djed&quot; pillar, representing &quot;stability&quot;. According to this hypothesis, the form of each sign is drawn from a part of the anatomy of a bull, like some other hieroglyphic signs that are known to be based on body parts of animals. In Egyptian belief semen was connected with life and, to some extent, with &quot;power&quot; or &quot;dominion&quot;, and some texts indicate the Egyptians believed semen originated in the bones. Therefore, Gordon and Schwabe suggest the signs are based on parts of the bull&#x27;s anatomy through which semen was thought to pass: the ankh is a thoracic vertebra, the &quot;djed&quot; is the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, and the &quot;was&quot; is the dried penis of the bull.

==Use in religion and art==
In Egyptian belief, life was a force that circulated throughout the world. Individual living things, including humans, were manifestations of this force and fundamentally tied to it. Life came into existence at the creation of the world, and cyclical events like the rising and setting of the sun were thought of as reenactments of the original events of creation that maintained and renewed life in the cosmos. Sustaining life was thus the central function of the deities who governed these natural cycles. Therefore, the ankh was frequently depicted being held in gods&#x27; hands, representing their life-giving power. The Egyptians also believed that when they died, their individual lives could be renewed in the same manner as life in general. For this reason, the gods were often depicted in tombs giving ankh signs to humans, usually the pharaoh. As the sign represented the power to bestow life, humans other than the pharaoh were rarely shown receiving or holding the ankh before the end of the Middle Kingdom, although this convention weakened thereafter. The pharaoh to some extent represented Egypt as a whole, so by giving the sign to him, the gods granted life to the entire nation.

By extension of the concept of &quot;life&quot;, the ankh could signify air or water. In artwork, gods hold the ankh up to the nose of the king: offering him the breath of life. Hand fans were another symbol of air in Egyptian iconography, and the human servants who normally carried fans behind the king were sometimes replaced in artwork by personified ankh signs with arms. In scenes of ritual purification, in which water was poured over the king or a deceased commoner, the zigzag lines that normally represented water could be replaced by chains of ankh signs.

The ankh may have been used decoratively more than any other hieroglyphic sign. Mirrors, mirror cases, and floral bouquets were made in its shape, given that the sign was used in writing the name of each of these objects. Some other objects, such as libation vessels and sistra, were also shaped like the sign. The sign appeared very commonly in the decoration of architectural forms such as the walls and shrines within temples. In contexts such as these, the sign often appeared together with the &quot;was&quot; and &quot;djed&quot; signs, which together signified &quot;life, dominion, and stability&quot;. In some decorative friezes in temples, all three signs, or the ankh and &quot;was&quot; alone, were positioned above the hieroglyph for a basket that represented the word &quot;all&quot;: &quot;all life and power&quot; or &quot;all life, power, and stability&quot;. Some deities, such as Ptah and Osiris, could be depicted holding a &quot;was&quot; scepter that incorporated elements of the ankh and &quot;djed&quot;.

Amulets made in the shape of hieroglyphic signs were meant to impart to the wearer the qualities represented by the sign. The Egyptians wore amulets in daily life as well as placing them in tombs to ensure the well-being of the deceased in the afterlife. Ankh-shaped amulets first appeared late in the Old Kingdom (c. 2700 to 2200 BC) and continued to be used into the late first millennium BC, yet they were rare, despite the importance of the symbol. Amulets shaped like a composite sign that incorporated the ankh, &quot;was&quot;, and &quot;djed&quot; were more widespread.

Ankh signs in two-dimensional art were typically painted blue or black. The earliest ankh amulets were often made of gold or electrum, a gold and silver alloy. Egyptian faience, a ceramic that was usually blue or green, was the most common material for ankh amulets in later times, perhaps because its color represented life and regeneration.

==Other ancient cultures==

The people of Syria and Canaan adopted many Egyptian artistic motifs during the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1950–1500 BC), including hieroglyphs, of which the ankh was by far the most common. It was often placed next to various figures in artwork or shown being held by Egyptian deities who had come to be worshipped in the ancient Near East. It was sometimes used to represent water or fertility. Elsewhere in the Near East, the sign was incorporated into Anatolian hieroglyphs to represent the word for &quot;life&quot;, and the sign was used in the artwork of the Minoan civilization centered on Crete. Minoan artwork sometimes combined the ankh, or the related &quot;tyet&quot; sign, with the Minoan double axe emblem.

Artwork in the Meroitic Kingdom, which lay south of Egypt and was heavily influenced by its religion, features the ankh prominently. It appears in temples and funerary art in many of the same contexts as in Egypt, and it is also one of the most common motifs in the decoration of Meroitic pottery.

Use of the ankh persisted in Israel into the Iron Age. In 2015, a clay seal (or bulla) belonging to King Hezekiah of Judah (c. 700 BC) was discovered in Jerusalem, which featured ankhs on either side of a winged sun figure.

==Christianity==

The ankh was one of the few ancient Egyptian artistic motifs that continued to be used after the Christianization of Egypt during the 4th and 5th centuries AD. The sign resembles the staurogram, a sign that resembles a Christian cross with a loop to the right of the upper bar and was used by early Christians as a monogram for Jesus, as well as the &quot;crux ansata&quot;, or &quot;handled cross&quot;, which is shaped like an ankh with a circular rather than oval or teardrop-shaped loop. The staurogram has been suggested to be influenced by the ankh, but the earliest Christian uses of the sign date to around AD 200, well before the earliest Christian adoption of the ankh. The earliest known example of a &quot;crux ansata&quot; comes from a copy of the Gospel of Judas from the 3rd or early 4th century AD. The adoption of this sign may have been influenced by the staurogram, the ankh, or both.

According to Socrates of Constantinople, when Christians were dismantling Alexandria&#x27;s greatest temple, the Serapeum, in 391 AD, they noticed cross-like signs inscribed on the stone blocks. Pagans who were present said the sign meant &quot;life to come&quot;, an indication that the sign Socrates referred to was the ankh; Christians claimed the sign was their own, indicating that they could easily regard the ankh as a &quot;crux ansata&quot;.

There is little evidence for the use of the &quot;crux ansata&quot; in the western half of the Roman Empire, but Egyptian Coptic Christians used it in many media, particularly in the decoration of textiles.

==Modern use==
Much more recently, the ankh has become a popular symbol in modern Western culture, particularly as a design for jewelry and tattoos. Its resurgence began when the counterculture of the 1960s stirred a greater interest in ancient religions. In the 21st century it is the most widely recognized symbol of African origin in the Western world, and it is sometimes used by people of African descent in the United States and Europe as a symbol of African cultural identity. The ankh also symbolizes Kemetism, a group of religious movements based on the religion of ancient Egypt. The sign is also popular in the goth subculture, being particularly associated with vampires, because an ankh pendant appears prominently in the 1983 vampire film &quot;The Hunger&quot;.

The sign is incorporated twice in the Unicode standard for encoding text and symbols in computing. It appears as U+2625 (☥) in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, and as U+132F9 (𓋹) in the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block.

<doc id="245793" wikidata="Q114147" url="?curid=245793" title="Usa, Ōita">
<text> is a city located in Ōita Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 52,808 in 26026 households, and a population density of 120 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . It is notable for Usa Jingū, the head shrine of all 40,000 Hachiman shrines across Japan.

==Geography==
Usa is located on the northern base of the Kunisaki Peninsula and faces the Gulf of Suō to the north, Nakatsu City to the west, Kusu Town and Yufu City to the south, and Kitsuki City and Bungotakada City to the east. 

Three districts have traditionally been economic and cultural centers: the Usa district (particularly Minami-Usa), which developed as the shrine town associated with Usa Jingū (also known as the Usa Shrine), the Yokkaichi district, which developed as the temple town of Hongan-ji Temple and administrative center, and the Nagasu district, which developed as a port town. 

===Neighboring municipalities===

===Climate===
Usa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is somewhat lower in winter. The average annual temperature in Usa is . The average annual rainfall is with July as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Usa was on 31 July 2015; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 26 February 1981.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Usa in 2020 is 52,771 people. Usa has been conducting censuses since 1950.

==History==
The area of Usa was the southeastern tip of the former Buzen Province and on the border with the former Bungo Province. The name &quot;Usa&quot; appears in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and Emperor Jimmu visited Usa prior to departing to the east for his conquest of Yamato. Due to the economic and political power of Usa Jingū, no samurai clan was able to dominate the area until the Sengoku period during which time it became a battleground between the Ōuchi clan and Ōtomo clan and later the Shimazu clan. Under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Buzen province became the territory of Kuroda Yoshitaka, who constructed Nakatsu Castle. During the Edo period it was mostly &quot;tenryō&quot; administered directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, with smaller areas under control of Nakatsu Domain, Shimabara Domain and Usa Jingū. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Usa within Usa District, Ōita was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system.
On April 1, 1955 Kitsuki merged with the villages of Yasaka, Kita-Kitsuki and, Nakarie and was raised to city status. On October 1, 2005 Kitsuki merged with the town of Yamaka from Hayami District and the village of Ota from Nishikunisaki District, Ōita. On April 1, 1967 Usa merged with the towns of Ekigawa, Yokkaichi, and Nagasu to form the city of Usa. On March 31, 2005, the towns of Ajimu and Innai (both from Usa District) were merged into Usa.

During World War II, the Usa Naval Air Group (宇佐海軍航空隊, &quot;Usa Kaigun Koukūtai&quot;) was stationed at an airbase in Usa. Towards the end of the war, the airbase was used to launch &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks against American forces. It was subject to B-29 air raids in 1945 which led to the destruction of many of the airfield&#x27;s facilities and caused the deaths of many soldiers and civilians. Many remnants of the former airfield are still visible. For example, there are several concrete bunkers which once held A6M Zero fighter aircraft. There is also a crater called the &quot;bomb pond&quot; which was caused by a bomb from an American B-29 bomber.
==Government==
Usa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 21 members. Usa contributes three members to the Ōita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Ōita 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
The economy of Usa remains largely agricultural. It has close economic ties with neighboring Nakatsu, and belongs to the urban employment area (10% commuting area) of the Nakatsu metropolitan area.

==Education==
Usa has 24 public elementary schools and seven public junior high schools operated by the city government and three public high schools operated by the Ōita Prefectural Board of Education. The city also has one private high school.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
 JR Kyushu - Nippō Main Line

=== Highways ===
* Higashikyushu Expressway
* 
* 

==Local attractions==

*Futaba no Sato, a museum dedicated to sumo wrestler Futabayama Sadaji, is located in the city. There is a statue outside the museum, built by the government in 1999, depicting the names and hand prints of three sumo wrestlers who have won more than 60 competitive bouts. In addition to Futubayama, Tanikaze Kajinosuke and Hakuhō Shō are represented on the statue.
*Kyushu Natural Animal Park African Safari, a large safari park, is located in Ajimu. 
*Usa Jingū is situated in the city, and attracts as many as 1.8 million visitors annually. Nearby is the Ōita Prefectural Museum of History.

==Anecdotes==
===Product labeling===
There have been claims that products made in this town and exported to the US as early as the 1930s carried the label &quot;MADE IN USA&quot;, for it to appear as if the product was made in the United States. There are reports that the name of the town was changed to &quot;USA&quot; for this purpose. The aforementioned claims are false. The city had this name long before the 1960s. Usa is a city and products must be labeled by country of origin, making it highly improbable that this would be an adequate loophole. In addition, any products being imported to the U.S. marked as being &quot;made in USA&quot; would have been flagged.

==Notable people from Usa==
*Futabayama Sadaji, 35th yokozuna in sumo

<doc id="245794" wikidata="Q211761" url="?curid=245794" title="Salyut 1">
<text>Salyut 1 (), also known as DOS-1 (Durable Orbital Station 1), was the world&#x27;s first space station. It was launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. The &quot;Salyut&quot; program subsequently achieved five more successful launches of seven additional stations. The program&#x27;s final module, &quot;Zvezda&quot; (DOS-8), became the core of the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station and remains in orbit today.

Salyut 1 was adapted from an Almaz airframe and comprised five components: a transfer compartment, a main compartment, two auxiliary compartments, and the Orion 1 Space Observatory. It was visited by the Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 11 missions. While the crew of Soyuz 10 was able to soft dock, the hard-docking failed, forcing the crew to abort their mission. The Soyuz 11 crew successfully docked, spending 23 days aboard Salyut 1 conducting experiments. The Soyuz 11 crew died of asphyxia caused by a valve failure just before reentry, making them the only humans to have died above the Kármán line.

Following the deaths, the mission of Salyut 1 was terminated, and the station reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, burning up on October 11, 1971.

== Background ==
Salyut 1 originated as a modification of the Soviet military&#x27;s Almaz space station program that was then in development. After the landing of Apollo 11 on the Moon in July 1969, the Soviets began shifting the primary emphasis of their crewed space program to orbiting space stations, with a possible lunar landing later in the 1970s if the N-1 rocket became flight-worthy. Leonid Brezhnev canceled the lunar landing program in 1974 after four catastrophic N-1 launch failures. One other motivation for the space station program was a desire to one-up the US Skylab program then in development. The basic structure of Salyut 1 was adapted from the Almaz with a few modifications and would form the basis of all Soviet space stations through Mir.

Civilian Soviet space stations were internally referred to as DOS (Durable Orbital Station), although publicly, the Salyut name was used for the first six DOS stations (&quot;Mir&quot; was internally known as DOS-7). Several military experiments were nonetheless carried on Salyut 1, including the OD-4 optical visual ranger, the Orion ultraviolet instrument for characterizing rocket exhaust plumes, and the highly classified Svinets radiometer.

== Construction and operational history ==
Construction of Salyut 1 began in early 1970, and after nearly a year it was shipped to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Some remaining assembly had yet to be done, and this was completed at the launch center. The Salyut programme was managed by Kerim Kerimov, chairman of the state commission for Soyuz missions.

Launch was planned for April 12, 1971 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s flight on Vostok 1, but technical problems delayed it until April 19. The first crew launched later in the Soyuz 10 mission, but they ran into troubles while docking and were unable to enter the station; the Soyuz 10 mission was aborted and the crew returned safely to Earth. A replacement crew launched on Soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 days. This was the first time in the history of spaceflight that a space station had been occupied, and a new record was set for time spent in space. This success was, however, short-lived when the crew was killed during reentry, as a pressure-equalization valve in the Soyuz 11 reentry capsule had opened prematurely, causing the crew to asphyxiate. They were the first and, as of 2025, only humans to have died in space. After this accident, all missions were suspended while the Soyuz spacecraft was redesigned. The station was intentionally destroyed by de-orbiting after six months in orbit, because it ran out of fuel before a redesigned Soyuz spacecraft could be launched to it.

==Structure==
At launch, the announced purpose of Salyut was to test the elements of the systems of a space station and to conduct scientific research and experiments. The craft was described as being in length, in maximum diameter, and in interior space with an on-orbit dry mass of . Of its several compartments, three were pressurized (100 m3 total), and two could be entered by the crew.

===Transfer compartment===
The transfer compartment was equipped with the only docking port of Salyut 1, which allowed one Soyuz 7K-OKS spacecraft to dock. It was the first use of the Soviet SSVP docking system that allowed internal crew transfer, a system that is in use today. The docking cone had a front diameter and a aft diameter.

===Main compartment===
The second and main compartment was about in diameter. Televised views showed enough space for eight large chairs (seven at work consoles), several control panels, and 20 portholes (some obstructed by instruments). The interior design used various colors (light and dark gray, apple green, light yellow) for supporting the cosmonauts’ orientation in weightlessness.

===Auxiliary compartments===
The third pressurized compartment contained the control and communications equipment, the power supply, the life support system, and other auxiliary equipment. The fourth and final unpressurized compartment was about 2 m in diameter and contained the engine installations and associated control equipment. Salyut had buffer chemical batteries, reserve supplies of oxygen and water, and regeneration systems. Externally mounted were two double sets of solar cell panels that extended like wings from the smaller compartments at each end, the heat regulation system&#x27;s radiators, and orientation and control devices.

Salyut 1 was modified from one of the Almaz airframes. The unpressurized service module was the modified service module of a Soyuz craft.

===Orion 1 Space Observatory===
The astrophysical Orion 1 Space Observatory designed by Grigor Gurzadyan of Byurakan Observatory in Armenia, was installed in Salyut 1. Ultraviolet spectrograms of stars were obtained with the help of a mirror telescope of the Mersenne system and a spectrograph of the Wadsworth system using film sensitive to the far ultraviolet. The dispersion of the spectrograph was 32 Å/mm (3.2 nm/mm), while the resolution of the spectrograms derived was about 5 Å at 2600 Å (0.5 nm at 260 nm). Slitless spectrograms were obtained of the stars &quot;Vega&quot; and &quot;Beta Centauri&quot; between 2000 and 3800 Å (200 and 380 nm). The telescope was operated by crew member Viktor Patsayev, who became the first man to operate a telescope outside of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==Visiting spacecraft and crews==
The only spacecraft that ever docked to Salyut 1 were Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 11. Soyuz 10 failed to hard-dock with Salyut 1 and had to abort the mission. Soyuz 11 conducted experiments in Salyut 1 for 23 days, however the cosmonauts later died during reentry in their Soyuz capsule.

===Soyuz 10===

Soyuz 10 was launched on April 22, 1971, carrying cosmonauts Vladimir Shatalov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Nikolai Rukavishnikov. After taking 24 hours for rendezvous and approach, Soyuz 10 soft-docked with Salyut 1 on April 24 at 01:47 UTC and remained for 5.5 h. Hard-docking was unsuccessful due to technical malfunctions. The crew could not enter the station and had to return to Earth on April 24.

===Soyuz 11===

Soyuz 11 was launched on June 6, 1971 at 04:55:09 UTC and took 3 hours and 19 minutes on June 7 to complete docking. The cosmonauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Viktor Patsayev, and Vladislav Volkov entered to Salyut 1 and their mission was announced as:
* Checking the design, units, onboard systems, and equipment of the orbital piloted station.
* Testing the station&#x27;s manual and autonomous procedures for orientation and navigation, as well as the control systems for maneuvering the space complex in orbit.
* Studying Earth&#x27;s surface geology, geography, meteorology, and snow and ice cover.
* Studying physical characteristics, processes, and phenomena in the atmosphere and outer space in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
* Conducting medico-biological studies to determine the feasibility of having cosmonauts in the station perform various tasks, and studying the influence of space flight on the human organism.

On June 29, after 23 days and flying 362 orbits, the mission was cut short due to problems aboard the station, including an electrical fire. The crew transferred back to Soyuz 11 and reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The capsule parachuted to a soft landing at 23:16:52 UTC in Kazakhstan, but the recovery team opened the hatch to find all three crew members dead in their couches. An inquest found that a pressure relief valve had malfunctioned during reentry leading to a loss of cabin atmosphere. The crew were not wearing pressure suits, and it was decreed by the TsKBEM (the team of engineers who investigated the tragedy) that all further Soyuz missions would require the use of them.

==Reentry of Salyut 1==

Salyut 1 was moved to a higher orbit in July–August 1971 to ensure that it would not be destroyed prematurely through orbital decay. In the meantime, Soyuz capsules were being substantially redesigned to allow pressure suits to be worn during launch, docking maneuvers, and re-entry. The Soyuz redesign effort took too long however, and by September, Salyut 1 was running out of fuel. It was decided to conclude the station&#x27;s mission and on October 11, the main engines were fired for a deorbit maneuver. After 175 days, the world&#x27;s first space station burned up over the Pacific Ocean.

&quot;Pravda&quot; (October 26, 1971) reported that 75% of Salyut 1&#x27;s studies were carried out by optical means and 20% by radio-technical means, while the remainder involved magnetometrical, gravitational, or other measurements. Synoptic readings were taken in both the visible and invisible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<text>The Wairarapa (; ), a geographical region of New Zealand, lies in the south-eastern corner of the North Island, east of metropolitan Wellington and south-west of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region. It is lightly populated, having several rural service towns, with Masterton being the largest. It is named after its largest lake, Lake Wairarapa.

The region is referred to as The Wairarapa, particularly when used after a preposition (e.g., locals will say they live &quot;in the Wairarapa&quot;, and travel &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from the Wairarapa&quot;).

==Boundaries==

The Wairarapa is shaped like a rectangle, about long (from Palliser Bay north to Woodville) and wide (from the Tararua Range east to the coast). The Ngāti Kahungunu tribe&#x27;s boundary for the region is similar. Their tribal area begins at Pōrangahau and ends at Turakirae. It is the southernmost of their three rohe (homelands) running down the eastern North Island from Wairoa. For the Rangitāne tribe, the Wairarapa is part of a wider homeland that includes Manawatū and Horowhenua.

The north–south divide was reinforced in 1989, when local authority boundaries changed. The new Tararua District Council covers northern Wairarapa and southern Hawke&#x27;s Bay. The central and southern Wairarapa was divided into three district councils: Masterton, Carterton and the South Wairarapa. South Wairarapa District Council, based in Martinborough, is the local government authority for areas south of Carterton, encompassing the towns of Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough and the rural areas down to the Hutt. It is separated from Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt cities by the Rimutaka Ranges. Carterton District Council based in Carterton is the fastest growing area in New Zealand and the Masterton District Council covers areas up to the Tararua District. As such, the majority — but not all — of the Wairarapa lies within the Wellington Region.

In terms of national politics, after the proportional representation electoral system was introduced in 1996, the Wairarapa electorate expanded to include southern Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

The area from Mount Bruce north, extending through Eketāhuna, Pahiatua, Woodville, Dannevirke, to just north of Norsewood is part of the Tararua District and is in the Manawatū-Whanganui region, because it is in the catchment of the headwaters of the Manawatū River. The river runs westward between the two mountain ranges (Tararua Range to the south and Ruahine Range to the north) via the Manawatū Gorge, to pass through Palmerston North and reach the west coast of the North Island.

The east coast contains settlements such as Tīnui, Castlepoint, and Riversdale Beach, while the main southern rivers drain through or past Lake Wairarapa to discharge into Palliser Bay east of Cook Strait.
==History==

The name &quot;Wairarapa&quot; means &quot;glistening waters&quot; in the Māori language. According to some oral histories, the Polynesian explorer Kupe named the wetlands after touching down in the area several times. According to other oral histories, explorer Haunui named the wetlands after the way the lake appeared to glisten from the Remutaka Ranges to the west.

During British colonial times the region was also known colloquially as &quot;The Wydrop&quot;.

Rangitāne and Ngāti Kahungunu were the resident Māori tribes (&quot;iwi&quot;) when European explorers arrived in the area in the 1770s.

European settlement began in the early 1840s, initially on large grazing runs leased from Māori, and with closer settlement from the 1850s.

On 23 January 1855 the strongest earthquake recorded in New Zealand hit the region; it reached magnitude 8.2 on the Richter Scale and caused five deaths among the then sparse population.

In World War II United States Marine Corps soldiers were stationed in the Wairarapa with two battalions in Masterton.

==Economy==
The agricultural industries, including forestry, cropping, sheep, beef and dairy farming, are major land users. The area around Martinborough, in the south, is notable for its vineyards and wine, as are the outskirts of Masterton and Carterton. Beer has been brewed at Mangatainoka, near Pahiatua, since 1889. There are over 60 wineries in the region since the weather is very similar to Burgundy. Deer farming is growing in importance.

===Transport===
The region is no longer well served by different transport modes, unless traveling to Wellington. A car is helpful. The State Highway 2, via Rimutaka Hill Road connects the region to Wellington in the south and the Manawatū in the north. The Wairarapa railway line connects the region via the Rimutaka Tunnel to Wellington. A commuter rail passenger service, the Wairarapa Connection from Masterton to Wellington is operated by Metlink Wellington for Metlink. Before 2016, it was operated by Tranz Metro.

Many residents, especially in the southern towns such as Featherston and Greytown, commute to work in Wellington, either by train or over the Rimutaka Ranges by car or motorcycle.

==Wildlife==

Many of New Zealand&#x27;s endangered native bird species can be seen at the Pukaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre, which is just south of Eketāhuna.

== International Dark Sky Reserve ==

In January 2023, an area of , was certified as the Wairarapa Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association. It was the second dark sky reserve to be certified in New Zealand (after the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve was recognised in 2012). The certification of the new dark sky reserve was the result of 5 years of volunteer work by the Wairarapa Dark Sky Reserve Association and local partner organisations. The area covered by the reserve includes the Aorangi Forest Park, and the South Wairarapa and Carterton Districts.

<text>Salyut 2 (OPS-1) ( meaning &quot;Salute 2&quot;) was a Soviet space station which was launched in 1973 as part of the Salyut programme. It was the first Almaz military space station to fly. Within two weeks of its launch, the station had lost altitude control and depressurized, leaving it unusable. Its orbit decayed and it re-entered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973, without any crews having visited it.

==Spacecraft==

Salyut 2 was an Almaz military space station. 
It was designated part of the Salyut programme in order to conceal the existence of the two separate space station programmes.

Salyut 2 was long with a diameter of , and had an internal habitable volume of . At launch it had a mass of . A single aft-mounted docking port was intended for use by Soyuz spacecraft carrying cosmonauts to work aboard the station. Two solar arrays mounted at the aft end of the station near the docking port provided power to the station, generating a total of 3,120 watts of electricity. The station was equipped with 32 attitude control thrusters, as well as two RD-0225 engines, each capable of generating of thrust, for orbital manoeuvres.

==Launch==
Salyut 2 was launched from Site 81/23 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a three-stage Proton-K rocket, serial number 283-01. The launch took place at 09:00:00 UTC on 3 April 1973, and successfully placed Salyut 2 into low Earth orbit. Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 2 was assigned the International Designator 1973-017A, whilst NORAD gave it the Satellite Catalog Number 06398. The third stage (8S812) of the Proton-K rocket entered orbit along with Salyut 2. On 4 April, it was catalogued in a orbit, inclined at 51.4 degrees.

==Failure==
Three days after the launch of Salyut 2, the Proton&#x27;s spent third stage exploded, due to pressure changes within the tanks. This explosion resulted in a cloud of debris, some of which followed a similar trajectory to the station. Ten days later this debris struck the station, damaging the hull and causing depressurization. Both solar panels were torn free, removing the ability of the station to generate power and control its attitude.

Three pieces of debris from the station were catalogued, and had decayed from orbit by 13 May. The remainder of the station reentered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973 over the Pacific Ocean.

An inquiry into the failure initially determined that a fuel line had burst, burning a hole in the station. The damage from the debris collision was only discovered later.

==Fidel Castro tour==

When First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Fidel Castro was in the Soviet Union as part of a whirlwind tour in 1972, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev brought Fidel Castro to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. 
Fidel Castro was photographed inside both the Soyuz docking trainer and the Salyut-2 (OPS-1/Almaz) military space station.

<text>Salyut 3 (, also known as OPS-2 or Almaz 2) was a Soviet space station launched on 25 June 1974. It was the second Almaz military space station, and the first such station to be launched successfully. It was included in the Salyut program to disguise its true military nature. Due to the military nature of the station, the Soviet Union was reluctant to release information about its design, and about the missions relating to the station.

It attained an altitude of 219 to 270 km on launch and NASA reported its final orbital altitude was 268 to 272 km. Only one of the three intended crews successfully boarded and operated the station, brought by Soyuz 14. Soyuz 15 attempted to bring a second crew but failed to dock, after which the third planned mission to the station was cancelled.

Although little official information has been released about the station, several sources report that it contained multiple Earth-observation cameras, as well as an on-board gun. The station was deorbited and re-entered the atmosphere on 24 January 1975. The next space station launched by the Soviet Union was the civilian station Salyut 4; the next military station was Salyut 5, which was the final &quot;Almaz&quot; space station.

==Background==
The first space station, &quot;Salyut 1&quot; (also known as DOS-1), was launched by the Soviet Union in April 1971. Only one mission successfully docked with &quot;Salyut 1&quot;: &quot;Soyuz 11&quot;. Its three-person crew spent 22 days aboard the station in June 1971. Tragically, the crew was killed just before reentry after undocking from the station.

At the time, the Soviet Union had competing &quot;civilian&quot; and military space programs. &quot;Salyut 1&quot;, was developed under the civilian program. These civilian stations, were also known as Long-term Orbital Stations (DOS). Successors to &quot;Salyut 1&quot; included the unsuccessful &quot;DOS-2&quot; in 1972 and &quot;DOS-3&quot; in 1974, followed by the successful launches of &quot;Salyut 4&quot;, &quot;Salyut 6&quot;, and &quot;Salyut 7&quot;.

The military space stations, known as Almaz stations or Orbital Piloted Stations (OPS), were similar in size and shape to the civilian DOS stations. However, their designs, attributed to Vladimir Chelomey, were significantly different. To conceal their military purpose, these stations were also publicly designated as Salyut stations. The first Almaz station, &quot;Salyut 2&quot;, launched in April 1973 but failed within days of reaching orbit and was never crewed.

==Description==
Salyut 3 consisted of an airlock chamber, a large-diameter work compartment, and a small-diameter living compartment, giving a total habitable volume of . It had two solar arrays, one docking port, and two main engines, each of which could produce of thrust. Its launch mass was .

The station came equipped with a shower, a standing sleeping station, as well as a foldaway bed. The floor was covered with Velcro to assist the cosmonauts moving around the station. Some entertainment on the station included a magnetic chess set, a small library, and a cassette deck with some audio cassette tapes. Exercise equipment included a treadmill and Pingvin exercise suit. The first water-recycling facilities were tested on the station; the system was called Priboy.

===Earth-observation cameras===
The work compartment was dominated by the &quot;Agat-1&quot; Earth-observation telescope, which had a focal length of and an optical resolution better than three metres, according to post-Soviet sources; NASA historian Siddiqi has speculated that given the size of the telescope&#x27;s mirror, it likely had a resolution better than . The telescope was used in conjunction with a wide-film camera and primarily for military reconnaissance. The cosmonauts are said to have observed targets set out on the ground at Baikonur. Secondary objectives included the study of water pollution, agricultural land, possible ore-bearing landforms, and oceanic ice formation.

The cosmonauts were able to develop film while on the station. Important or interesting images were printed and then scanned by a TV imaging system for broadcast to Earth. They needed as little as 30 minutes to shoot, develop, and scan a photograph. Less important images were packed into a small Earth-return capsule, which could be ejected from the station.

In addition to the Agat-1 camera, other cameras on board included a topographical camera, a star camera, and a Volga infrared camera with a resolution of . Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, who visited the station as the commander of Soyuz 14, recalled that the station was equipped with 14 cameras.

===On-board gun===
The Salyut 3, although called a &quot;civilian&quot; station, was equipped with a &quot;self-defence&quot; gun which had been designed for use aboard the station, and whose design is attributed to Alexander Nudelman. Some accounts claim the station was equipped with a Nudelman-Rikhter &quot;Vulkan&quot; gun, which was a variant of the 23 mm Nudelman aircraft cannon, or possibly a Nudelman NR-30 30 mm gun. Later Russian sources indicate that the gun was the virtually unknown (in the West) Rikhter R-23. These claims have reportedly been verified by Pavel Popovich, who had visited the station in orbit, as commander of Soyuz 14. Due to the potential shaking of the station, in-orbit tests of the weapon with cosmonauts in the station were ruled out. The gun was fixed to the station in such a way that the only way to aim would have been to change the orientation of the entire station. Following the last crewed mission to the station, the gun was commanded by the ground to be fired; some sources say it was fired to depletion, while other sources say three test firings took place during the Salyut 3 mission.

==Station operations==
Only one crewed spacecraft, Soyuz 14, docked with Salyut 3. One other spacecraft, Soyuz 15, came within 40 metres of the station, but failed to dock due to a malfunctioning rendezvous system.

===Launch===
The station was launched on 25 June 1974 by a three-stage Proton launch vehicle.

Salyut 3 was the first space station to maintain its constant orientation relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface. To achieve that, as many as 500,000 firings of the attitude control thrusters had been performed. Its initial orbit was 219 km by 270 km above mean sea level, which was considered low. The suspicions of Western observers were raised by the low altitude, combined with the choice of a crew from the Soviet Air Force, and the use of radio frequencies normally designated for military use.

===Soyuz 14===

On 4 July, a little over a week after Salyut 3 was launched, the crewed spacecraft Soyuz 14 docked with the station, having been launched the previous day. The crew of Soyuz 14 consisted of commander Pavel Popovich and flight engineer Yury Artyukhin. The crew spent 15 days aboard the station.

On 9 July, it was reported that the crew activated the Earth-observation cameras, and spent several days taking photos of various locations, including central Asia. They placed some film in the Earth return capsule. After undocking, Soyuz 14 safely landed on 19 July.

===Soyuz 15===

The spacecraft Soyuz 15 was launched on 26 August 1974, carrying a two-man crew consisting of commander Gennadi Sarafanov and flight engineer Lev Demin. They were intended to be the second crew to man Salyut 3, but failed to dock. The Igla rendezvous system on their Soyuz spacecraft malfunctioned, and the crew was unable to dock manually. Due to the limited battery life of their Soyuz spacecraft, they de-orbited and landed two days after launch. At the time of the spaceflight, Demin was 48 years old, earning him the record for the oldest person to fly in space up to that point. This record was broken the following year, with Deke Slayton&#x27;s spaceflight as a part of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project.

===Uncrewed operations===
Following the failed docking of Soyuz 15, it was decided that the Igla docking system needed significant modifications. Due to the amount of time needed to make the changes, and the limited time Salyut 3 had left in orbit due to orbital decay, the next planned mission to the station was cancelled. The spacecraft which would have been used on the third mission to Salyut 3 was later used for the mission Soyuz 20 to Salyut 4 (a civilian space station).

Following this decision, on 23 September 1974, the station&#x27;s Earth return capsule was released. The ejected capsule was deorbited by small engines. NASA sources report that the parachute of Salyut 3&#x27;s capsule opened at an altitude of 8.4 km. Other sources say the main parachute did not open, and the capsule was deformed upon landing, but that all the film was recoverable.

Also following the decision to not send any more cosmonauts to the station, the on-board gun was commanded by the ground to be fired; some sources say it was fired to depletion, while other sources say three test firings took place at the end of the mission.

The station was deorbited on 24 January 1975 over the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Salyut 4 (DOS 4) (; English translation: Salute 4) was a Salyut space station launched on December 26, 1974 into an orbit with an apogee of 355 km, a perigee of 343 km and an orbital inclination of 51.6 degrees. It was essentially a copy of the DOS 3 (or Kosmos 557), and unlike its ill-fated sibling it was a complete success. Three crews attempted to make stays aboard Salyut 4 (Soyuz 17 and Soyuz 18 docked; Soyuz 18a suffered a launch abort). The second stay was for 63 days duration, and an unmanned capsule, called Soyuz 20, remained docked to the station for three months, proving the system&#x27;s long-term durability despite some deterioration of the environmental system during Soyuz 18&#x27;s mission. Salyut 4 was deorbited February 2, 1977, and re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on February 3.

==Description==
Salyut 4 represented the second phase of DOS civilian space station. Although the basic design of Salyut 1 was retained, it switched to three large solar panels mounted on the forward module rather than its predecessor&#x27;s four small panels on the docking module and engine compartment, presumably to generate more power. It had an interior floor area of 34.8 sq. m The thrusts of the station&#x27;s attitude control thrusters were 2 X 59 N (pitch), 2 X 59 N (yaw) and 2 X 20 N (roll). The electric System produced an average of 2.00 kW of power. It had 2,000 kg of scientific equipment alongside two sets of three solar panels each and was equipped with the Delta Navigation System which was a new autonomous navigation system that calculates orbital elements without assistance from ground. It was powered by KTDU-66 thrusters.

===Instrumentation===
Installed on the Salyut 4 were OST-1 (Orbiting Solar Telescope) 25 cm solar telescope with a focal length of 2.5m and spectrograph shortwave diffraction spectrometer for far ultraviolet emissions, designed at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and two X-ray telescopes. One of the X-ray telescopes, often called the &quot;Filin telescope&quot;, consisted of four gas flow proportional counters, three of which had a total detection surface of 450 cm2 in the energy range 2–10 keV, and one of which had an effective surface of 37 cm2 for the range 0.2 to 2 keV (32 to 320 aJ). The field of view was limited by a slit collimator to 3 in × 10 in full width at half maximum. The instrumentation also included optical sensors which were mounted on the outside of the station together with the X-ray detectors, and power supply and measurement units which were inside the station. Ground-based calibration of the detectors was considered along with in-flight operation in three modes: inertial orientation, orbital orientation, and survey. Data could be collected in 4 energy channels: 2 to 3.1 keV (320 to 497 aJ), 3.1 to 5.9 keV (497 to 945 aJ), 5.9 to 9.6 keV (945 to 1,538 aJ), and 2 to 9.6 keV (320 to 1,538 aJ) in the larger detectors. The smaller detector had discriminator levels set at 0.2 keV (32 aJ), 0.55 keV (88 aJ), and 0.95 keV (152 aJ).

Other instruments include a swivel chair for vestibular function tests, lower body negative pressure gear for cardiovascular studies, bicycle ergometer integrated physical trainer (electrically driven running track 1 m X .3 m with elastic cords providing 50 kg load), penguin suits and alternate athletic suit, sensors for temperature and characteristics of upper atmosphere, ITS-K infrared telescope spectrometer and ultraviolet spectrometer for study of earth&#x27;s infrared radiation, multispectral earth resources camera, cosmic ray detector, embryological studies, new engineering instruments tested for orientation of station by celestial objects and in darkness and a teletypewriter.

==Science==
Among others, observations of Scorpius X-1, Circinus X-1, Cygnus X-1, and A0620-00 were published from the Filin data. A highly variable low energy of 0.6 to 0.9 keV (96 to 144 aJ) flux was detected in Sco X-1. Cir X-1 was not detected at all during a July 5, 1975 observation, providing an upper limit on the emission of 3.5e-11 erg·cm−2·s−1 (35 fW/m2) in the 0.2 to 2.0 keV (32 to 320 aJ) range. Cyg X-1 was observed on several occasions. Highly variable flux, in both the time and energy domains, was observed.

<text>Salyut 5 ( meaning &quot;Salute 5&quot;), also known as OPS-3, was a Soviet space station. Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each crewed by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched.

==Launch==
Salyut 5 was launched at 18:04:00 UTC on 22 June 1976. The launch took place from Site 81/23 the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, and used a three-stage Proton-K carrier rocket with the serial number 290–02.

Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 5 was assigned the International Designator 1976-057A, whilst the North American Aerospace Defense Command gave it the Satellite Catalog Number 08911.

==Spacecraft==
Salyut 5 was an Almaz spacecraft, the last of three to be launched as space stations after Salyut 2 and Salyut 3. Like its predecessors, it was long, with a maximum diameter of . It had a habitable interior volume of , and a mass at launch of . The station was equipped with a single docking port for Soyuz spacecraft, with the Soyuz 7K-T being the configuration in service at the time. Two solar arrays mounted laterally at the same end of the station as the docking port provided it with power. The station was equipped with a KSI capsule to return research data and materials.

Salyut 5 carried Agat, a camera which the crews used to observe the Earth. The German &quot;Kristall&quot; furnace was used for crystal growth experiments aboard the station.

==Operation==
Four crewed missions to Salyut 5 were originally planned. The first, Soyuz 21, was launched from Baikonur on 6 July 1976, and docked at 13:40 UTC the next day. The primary objective of the Soyuz 21 mission aboard Salyut 5 was to conduct military experiments, however scientific research was also conducted, which included studying aquarium fish in microgravity and observing the Sun. The crew also conducted a televised conference with school pupils. Cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitali Zholobov remained aboard Salyut 5 until 24 August, when they returned to Earth landing 200 km southwest of Kokchetav. The mission had been expected to last longer, however the atmosphere within Salyut 5 became contaminated with nitric acid fumes from a fuel leak, which affected the crew&#x27;s psychological and physical condition, necessitating an emergency landing.

On 14 October 1976, Soyuz 23 was launched carrying Vyacheslav Zudov and Valery Rozhdestvensky to the space station. During approach for docking the next day, a faulty sensor incorrectly detected an unexpected lateral motion. The spacecraft&#x27;s Igla automated docking system fired the spacecraft&#x27;s maneuvering thrusters in an attempt to stop the non-existent motion. Although the crew was able to deactivate the Igla system, the spacecraft had expended too much fuel to reattempt the docking under manual control. Soyuz 23 returned to Earth on 16 October without completing its mission objectives.

The last mission to Salyut 5, Soyuz 24, was launched on 7 February 1977. Its crew consisted of cosmonauts Viktor Gorbatko and Yury Glazkov, who conducted repairs aboard the station and vented the air which had been reported to be contaminated. Scientific experiments were conducted, including observation of the sun. The Soyuz 24 crew departed on 25 February. The short mission was apparently related to Salyut 5 starting to run low on propellant for its main engines and attitude control system.

The fourth planned mission, which would have been designated Soyuz 25 if launched, was intended to visit the station for two weeks in July 1977. It would have been crewed by cosmonauts Anatoly Berezovoy and Mikhail Lisun; the backup crew for the Soyuz 24 mission. The mission was cancelled for the above-mentioned shortage of propellant. The spacecraft which was constructed for the Soyuz 25 mission was reused for the Soyuz 30 mission to Salyut 6. Since it could not be refuelled, and no longer had the fuel to sustain crewed operations, the KSI recoverable capsule was ejected and returned to Earth on 26 February. Salyut 5 was deorbited on 8 August 1977 and burned up as it reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

<text>Salyut 6 () was a Soviet orbital space station, the eighth station of the Salyut programme, and alternatively known DOS-5 as it was the fifth of the Durable Orbital Station series of civilian space stations. It was launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket. Salyut 6 was the first space station to receive large numbers of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft for human habitation, crew transfer, international participation and resupply, establishing precedents for station life and operations which were enhanced on Mir and the International Space Station.

Salyut 6 was the first &quot;second generation&quot; space station, representing a major breakthrough in capabilities and operational success. In addition to a new propulsion system and its primary scientific instrument—the BST-1M multispectral telescope—the station had two docking ports, allowing two craft to visit simultaneously. This feature made it possible for humans to remain aboard for several months. Six long-term resident crews were supported by ten short-term visiting crews who typically arrived in newer Soyuz craft and departed in older craft, leaving the newer craft available to the resident crew as a return vehicle, thereby extending the resident crew&#x27;s stay past the design life of the Soyuz. Short-term visiting crews routinely included international cosmonauts from Warsaw pact countries participating in the Soviet Union&#x27;s Intercosmos programme. These cosmonauts were the first spacefarers from countries other than the Soviet Union or the United States. Salyut 6 was visited and resupplied by twelve uncrewed Progress spacecraft including Progress 1, the first instance of the series. Additionally, Salyut 6 was visited by the first instances of the new Soyuz-T spacecraft.

The success of Salyut 6 contrasted with the programme&#x27;s earlier failures and limited successes. The early history of the programme was plagued by the fatalities of Soyuz 11 and three launched stations which quickly failed. Earlier successful stations received few crews, limited to several weeks&#x27; habitation by the design life of their Soyuz craft and the presence of a single docking port per station; unsuccessful docking was also common. Salyut 6 on the other hand routinely received successful dockings of crewed and uncrewed craft, although the first visiting craft Soyuz 25 and later Soyuz 33 failed to dock with the station.

From 1977 to 1981, the station was occupied by human crews during six separate, discontinuous intervals, each coterminous with the presence of a resident crew who were first-in, last-out while support crew visited. Between each of these intervals Salyut 6 was vacant, although it was visited by Soyuz T-1 and Kosmos 1267 during its periods of vacancy. Following the launch of successor Salyut 7, Salyut 6 was de-orbited on 29 July 1982, almost five years after its own launch.

==Description==

Salyut 6, launched on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked the switch from engineering development stations to routine operations, and united the most effective elements from each of the previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta semi-automatic computer to depict the station&#x27;s orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels, together producing a peak of 4 kilowatts of power over 51 m2. The station&#x27;s thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station.

The most important feature on Salyut 6 was the addition of a second docking port on the aft end of the station, which allowed two spacecraft to be docked at once. This enabled resident crews to receive shorter, visiting expeditions whilst they remained on board, and for crew transfers to take place between the Soyuz craft. Typically, visiting crews returned to Earth in the older Soyuz which the resident crew had flown to the station, leaving a newer craft available to the resident crew as a return vehicle. This procedure allowed resident crews to remain aboard Salyut 6 past the three-month lifespan of the first-generation Soyuz 7K vehicle. Salyut 6 was not occupied continuously, or &quot;handed off&quot; from one expedition to another. Rather, the six resident crews took up occupancy in the station and were visited by various Soyuz support missions and Progress supply tugs, and upon each resident crew&#x27;s departure, Salyut 6 was vacant. The first long-duration crew to visit the station broke a long-standing endurance record set on board the American Skylab station, staying 96 days in orbit; the longest expedition lasted 185 days. Most of the visiting expeditions were flown as part of the Intercosmos programme, with non-Soviet cosmonauts visiting the station. Vladimír Remek of Czechoslovakia, the first space traveller not from the US or USSR, visited Salyut 6 in 1978, and the station hosted cosmonauts from Hungary, Poland, Romania, Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam, and East Germany. Georgi Ivanov, a Bulgarian, was a member of the crew of Soyuz 33, which failed to dock with the station. The failure implicated the resident crew&#x27;s Soyuz 32, with the result that a modified Soyuz 34 was launched to them without a crew, as a return vehicle.

The rearward of the two ports was fitted with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by uncrewed Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station replenished, helped ensure that the crew were always able to carry out useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20 tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.

The addition of the extra docking port caused the adoption of the Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzles – each producing 2.9 kilonewtons of thrust – mounted peripherally on either side of the aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a unified propulsion system, with both the engines and the station&#x27;s control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximal effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which had the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept an overall length similar to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.

Salyut 6&#x27;s propulsion system experienced a serious malfunction during the second crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again for the remainder of the station&#x27;s lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude-control thrusters, and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit, so it would not decay until the next residency began.

To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was equipped with an inward-opening EVA hatch on the side of the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits, which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits and could be donned within five minutes in an emergency. The station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated &quot;cots&quot; for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.

===Instruments===

The primary instrument carried aboard the station was the BST-1M multispectral telescope, which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared, ultraviolet and submillimeter spectra using a 1.5 metre-diameter mirror, which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around . The telescope could be operated only when Salyut 6 was on the night side of the Earth and had its cover closed for the rest of the time.

The second major instrument was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved form of a camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165 × 220 kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20 meters. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140 millimetres, which captured images of 450 × 450 kilometers with a resolution of 50 meters in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine the capabilities of the cameras.

To further expand its scientific capabilities, Salyut 6 was equipped with 20 portholes for observations, two scientific airlocks to expose equipment to space or eject rubbish, and various pieces of apparatus to carry out biological experiments. Later on during the flight, a Progress spacecraft delivered an external telescope, the radio observatory, which incorporated a directional antenna and five radiometers. The antenna was deployed on the rear docking assembly, with the controller remaining inside the station, and was used for both astronomical and meteorological observations.

==Support craft==
Salyut 6 was primarily supported by the crewed Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and would also have been used in the event of an emergency evacuation. The ferries docked automatically to the station, making use of the new Igla automatic docking system, and were used by departing crews to return to Earth at the end of their flight.

The station was the first to be able to be resupplied by the newly developed uncrewed Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.

In addition to the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, after the final crew had left, Salyut 6 was visited by an experimental transport logistics spacecraft called Kosmos 1267 in 1982. The transport logistics spacecraft, known as the TKS, was originally designed for the Almaz programme, and proved that large modules could dock automatically with space stations, a major step toward the construction of multimodular stations such as Mir and the International Space Station.

==Resident crews==
The station received 16 cosmonaut crews, including six long-duration crews, with the longest expedition lasting 185 days. Resident crew missions were identified with an &quot;EO&quot; prefix, whilst short-duration missions were identified with &quot;EP&quot;.

# On 10 December 1977 the first resident crew, Yuri Romanenko and Georgy Grechko, arrived on Soyuz 26 and remained aboard Salyut 6 for 96 days.
# On 15 June 1978, Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov (Soyuz 29) arrived and remained on board for 140 days.
# Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin (Soyuz 32) arrived on 25 February 1979 and stayed 175 days.
# On 9 April 1980 Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin (Soyuz 35) arrived for the longest stay on Salyut 6, 185 days. While aboard, on 19 July 1980, they sent their greetings to the Olympians and wished them happy starts in the live communication between the station and the Central Lenin Stadium, where the opening ceremony of the 1980 Summer Olympics was held. They appeared on the stadium&#x27;s scoreboard and their voices were translated via loud speakers.
# A repair mission, consisting of Leonid Kizim, Oleg Makarov, and Gennady Strekalov (Soyuz T-3) worked on the space station for 12 days starting on 27 November 1980.
# On 12 March 1981 the last resident crew, Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh, arrived and stayed for 75 days.

==Station operations==

===Docking operations===

On four occasions, a visiting Soyuz craft was transferred from the station&#x27;s aft port to its forward port. This was done to accommodate upcoming Progress shuttles, which could only refuel the station using connections available at the aft port. Typically, the resident crew would first dock at the forward port, leaving the aft port available for Progress craft and visiting Soyuz support crews. When a support crew docked at the aft port and left in the older, forward Soyuz, the resident crew would move the new vehicle forward by boarding it, undocking, and translating some 100–200 meters away from Salyut 6. Then, ground control would command the station itself to rotate 180 degrees, and the Soyuz would close and re-dock at the forward port. Soyuz 31, 34, 36 and 37 performed the operation, piloted by resident crews after the newer vehicles had been left available by departed support crews.

<text>Salyut 7 (), also known as DOS-6 (Durable Orbital Station 6) was a space station in low Earth orbit from April 1982 to February 1991. It was first crewed in May 1982 with two crew via Soyuz T-5, and last visited in June 1986, by Soyuz T-15. Various crew and modules were used over its lifetime, including 12 crewed and 15 uncrewed launches in total. Supporting spacecraft included the Soyuz T, Progress, and TKS spacecraft.

It was part of the Soviet Salyut programme, and launched on 19 April 1982 on a Proton-K rocket from Site 200/40 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Soviet Union. Salyut 7 was part of the transition from monolithic to modular space stations, acting as a testbed for docking of additional modules and expanded station operations. It was the eighth space station of any kind launched. Salyut 7 was the last of both the second generation of DOS-series space stations and of the monolithic Salyut Program overall, to be replaced by Mir, the modular, expandable, third generation.

==Description==
Salyut 7 was the backup vehicle for Salyut 6 and was very similar in equipment and capabilities. With delays to the Mir programme it was decided to launch the back-up vehicle as Salyut 7. In orbit the station suffered technical failures though it benefited from the improved payload capacity of the visiting Progress and Soyuz craft and the experience of its crews who improvised many solutions (such as a fuel line rupture in September 1983 requiring EVAs by the Soyuz T-10 crew to repair). It was aloft for eight years and ten months (a record not broken until Mir), during which time it was visited by 10 crews constituting six main expeditions and four secondary flights (including French and Indian cosmonauts). The station also saw two flights of Svetlana Savitskaya making her the second woman in space since Valentina Tereshkova first flew in June 1963 and the first woman to perform an EVA during which she conducted metal cutting and welding alongside her colleague Vladimir Dzhanibekov. Aside from the many experiments and observations made on Salyut 7, the station also tested the docking and use of large modules with an orbiting space station. The modules were called &quot;Heavy Kosmos modules&quot; though in reality were variants of the TKS intended for the cancelled Almaz military space station. They helped engineers develop the technology necessary to build Mir.

==Equipment==

It had two docking ports, one on either end of the station, to allow docking with the Progress uncrewed resupply craft, and a wider front docking port to allow safer docking with a Heavy Kosmos module. It carried three solar panels, two in lateral and one in dorsal longitudinal positions, but they now had the ability to mount secondary panels on their sides. Internally, the Salyut 7 carried electric stoves, a refrigerator, constant hot water and redesigned seats at the command console (more like bicycle seats). Two portholes were designed to allow ultraviolet light in, to help kill infections. The medical, biological and exercise sections were improved, to allow long stays in the station. The BST-1M telescope used in Salyut 6 was replaced by an X-ray detection system.

To support experiments in cultivating plants in space, several different plant life support systems were installed: Oasis 1A, Vazon, Svetoblok, Magnetogravistat, Biogravistat and Fiton(Phyton)-3. It was in Fiton-3 that &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; became the first plants to flower and produce seeds in the zero gravity of space.

Salyut 7 was the most advanced and comfortable space station of the Salyut series. A set of modifications to the interior made it more liveable. There were approximately 20 windows with shades on the Salyut 7. To protect the inside of the windows, they were covered with removable glass panels. The colour scheme was improved and a refrigerator was installed. The ceiling on the Salyut 7 was white; the left wall was apple green and the right one beige, a signature design by interior design architect, Galina Balashova, who carried on the concept through Soyuz to Mir and Buran, in an effort to replace &#x27;survive&#x27; with &#x27;comfort&#x27;, working with seasoned cosmonauts to make living conditions better and &#x27;closer to home&#x27; Externally, in a departure from previous first generation stations, the large diameter operations section which housed the large scientific apparatus, was colored in a distinctive brown-red and white stripe pattern. This was done to differentiate between it and the outwardly similar Salyut 6 that, for several months of its life, was in orbit at the same time.

==Crews and missions==
Following up the use of Kosmos 1267 on Salyut 6, the Soviets launched Kosmos 1443 on 2 March 1983 from a Proton SL-13. It docked with the station on 10 March, and was used by the crew of Soyuz T-9. It jettisoned its recovery module on 23 August, and re-entered the atmosphere on 19 September. Kosmos 1686 was launched on 27 September 1985, docking with the station on 2 October. It did not carry a recovery vehicle, and remained connected to the station for use by the crew of Soyuz T-14. Ten Soyuz T crews operated in Salyut 7. Only two Interkosmos &quot;guest cosmonauts&quot; worked in Salyut 7. The first attempt to launch Soyuz T-10 was aborted on the launch pad when a fire broke out at the base of the vehicle. The payload was ejected, and the crew was recovered safely.

Salyut 7 was the first manned space vehicle to launch a satellite, when it fired the small experimental Iskra 2 satellite out of its waste airlock. This was performed mainly to deprive the US Space Shuttle of becoming the first manned spacecraft to launch a satellite.

===Resident crews===
Salyut 7 had six resident crews.

* The first crew, Anatoli Berezovoy and Valentin Lebedev, arrived on 13 May 1982 on Soyuz T-5 and remained for 211 days until 10 December 1982.
* On 27 June 1983, the crew of Vladimir Lyakhov and Alexander Alexandrov arrived on Soyuz T-9 and remained for 150 days, until 23 November 1983. 
* On 8 February 1984, Leonid Kizim, Vladimir Solovyov and Oleg Atkov began a 237-day stay, the longest on Salyut 7, which ended on 2 October 1984.
* Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Viktor Savinykh (Soyuz T-13) arrived at the space station on 6 June 1985 to repair its malfunctions. 
* On 17 September 1985, Soyuz T-14 docked with the station carrying Vladimir Vasyutin, Alexander Volkov and Georgi Grechko. Eight days later Dzhanibekov and Grechko left the station and returned to Earth after 103 days, while Savinyikh, Vasyutin and Volkov remained on Salyut 7 and returned to Earth on 21 November 1985 after 65 days. 
* On 6 May 1986, Soyuz T-15 carrying Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov docked with the space station and undocked, after a 50-day stay, on 25 June 1986. The Soyuz had come from the Mir space station and returned to Mir on 26 June 1986 in a flight lasting 29 hours.

There were also four visiting missions, crews which came to bring supplies and make shorter duration visits with the resident crews.

==Technical and crew problems==
The station suffered from two major problems, the first of which required extensive repair work to be performed on a number of EVAs.

===Leaks===
On 9 September 1983, during the stay of Vladimir Lyakhov and Alexander Alexandrov, while reorienting the station to perform a radiowave transmission experiment, Lyakhov noticed the pressure of one fuel tank was almost zero. Following this, Alexandrov spotted a fuel leak when looking through the aft porthole. Ground control decided to try to repair the damaged pipes, in what was the most complex repair attempted during EVA at the time. This was to be attempted by the next crew, the current one lacking the necessary training and tools. The damage was eventually repaired by Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov, who needed four EVAs to fix two leaks. A special tool to fix the third leak was delivered by Soyuz T-12, and the leak was subsequently fixed.

===Loss of power===
On 11 February 1985, contact with Salyut 7 was lost. The station began to drift, making unpredictable movements in orbit, and all systems shut down. At this time the station was uninhabited, after the departure of Leonid Kizim, Vladimir Solovyov and Oleg Atkov, and before the next crew arrived. It was once again decided to attempt to repair the station. The work was performed by Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Viktor Savinykh on the Soyuz T-13 mission during June 1985, in what was in the words of author David S. F. Portree &quot;one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history&quot;. This operation forms the basis of the 2017 Russian film &quot;Salyut 7&quot;.

All Soviet and Russian space stations were equipped with automatic rendezvous and docking systems, from the first space station Salyut 1 using the Igla system, to the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station using the Kurs system. Upon arrival, on 6 June 1985, the Soyuz crew found the station was not broadcasting radar or telemetry for rendezvous, and after arrival and external inspection of the tumbling station, the crew estimated proximity using handheld laser rangefinders.

Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7 and matched the station&#x27;s rotation. After hard docking to the station and confirming the station&#x27;s electrical system was dead, Dzhanibekov and Savinykh sampled the station atmosphere prior to opening the hatch. Attired in winter fur-lined clothing, they entered the station to conduct repairs. The fault was eventually found to be an electrical sensor that determined when the batteries needed charging.

Once the batteries were replaced, the station started charging them, and warmed up over the next few days. Within a week sufficient systems were brought back online to allow uncrewed Progress cargo ships to dock with the station.

==End of life==

Salyut 7 was last inhabited in 1986 by the crew of Soyuz T-15, who ferried equipment from Salyut 7 to the new Mir space station. Between 19 and 22 August 1986, engines on Kosmos 1686 boosted Salyut 7 to a record-high mean orbital altitude of 475 km to forestall reentry until 1994. Retrieval at a future date by a Buran shuttle was also planned.

However, unexpectedly high solar activity in the late 1980s and early 1990s increased atmospheric drag on the station and sped its orbital decay. It finally underwent an uncontrolled reentry on 7 February 1991 over the town of Capitán Bermúdez in Argentina after it overshot its intended entry point, which would have placed its debris in uninhabited portions of the southern Pacific Ocean.

==Expeditions and visiting spacecraft==
Notation:
* &quot;EO&quot; () or &quot;PE&quot; means Principal Expedition
* &quot;EP&quot; () or &quot;VE&quot; means Visiting Expedition

===Expeditions===

===Spacewalks===

===Docking operations===

On three occasions, a visiting Soyuz craft was transferred from the station&#x27;s aft port to its forward port. This was done to accommodate upcoming Progress shuttles, which could only refuel the station using connections available at the aft port. Typically, the resident crew would first dock at the forward port, leaving the aft port available for Progress craft and visiting Soyuz support crews. When a support crew docked at the aft port and left in the older, forward Soyuz, the resident crew would move the new vehicle forward by boarding it, undocking, and translating some 100–200 meters away from Salyut 7. Then, ground control would command the station itself to rotate 180 degrees, and the Soyuz would close and re-dock at the forward port. Soyuz T-7, T-9 and T-11 performed the operation, piloted by resident crews.

==In popular culture==
The repair and reactivation of the station by Soyuz T-13 is the subject of the 2017 Russian historical drama &quot;Salyut 7&quot;. These events also served as a plot base for the Polish novel &quot;Połowa nieba&quot; (pol. &quot;Half the sky&quot;), by Bartek Biedrzycki (first published 2018), collected in &quot;Zimne światło gwiazd&quot; in 2020.

<text>The Battle of Myriokephalon (also known as the Battle of Myriocephalum, , or &quot;Düzbel Muharebesi&quot;) was a battle between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Turks in the mountains west of Iconium (Konya) in southwestern Turkey on 17 September 1176. The battle was a strategic reverse for the Byzantine forces, who were ambushed when moving through a mountain pass.

In 1161, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum Kilij Arslan II and Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos concluded a peace agreement. Manuel wanted to achieve peace for his Anatolian provinces with the help of this treaty. Kilij Arslan needed to eliminate internal rivals and gather his strength. After the death of Nureddin Zangi in 1174, the Sultan conquered the Danishmend emirates and expelled his brother Shahinshah, the ruler of Ankara. The emirs fled to Manuel, who demanded the surrender of the captured territories of the Danishmendids to him, which the Sultan was obliged to do under the treaty. However, Kilij Arslan ignored Manuel&#x27;s request.

In 1176, Manuel I Komnenos gathered a large army and set out on a campaign against Konya. The Seljuks, under the command of Kilij Arslan II, organised an ambush at the Tzivritze Pass and defeated the Byzantine Army. According to the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates, in the vicinity of the pass there were the ruins of the fortress named Myriokephalon, which gave the name to the battle. The exact location of the battle is the subject of debate among researchers. 

The battle was to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the Byzantines to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Seljuk Turks.

==Background==
Between 1158 and 1161 a series of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire, with the sultan recognising a form of subordination to the Byzantine emperor. Immediately after peace was negotiated the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II visited Constantinople where he was treated by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as both an honoured guest and an imperial vassal. Following this event there was no overt hostility between the two powers for many years. It was a fragile peace, however, as the Seljuks wanted to push from the arid central plateau of Asia Minor into the more fertile coastal lands, while the Byzantines wanted to recover the Anatolian territory they had lost since the Battle of Manzikert a century earlier.

During the long peace with the Seljuks, Manuel was able to concentrate his military power in other theatres. In the west, he defeated Hungary and imposed Byzantine control over all the Balkans. In the east, he recovered Cilicia from local Armenian dynasts and managed to reduce the Crusader Principality of Antioch to vassal status. However, peace with Byzantium also allowed Killij Arslan to eliminate internal rivals and strengthen his military resources. When the strongest Muslim ruler in Syria Nur ad-Din Zangi died in 1174, his successor Saladin was more concerned with Egypt and Palestine than the territory bordering the Empire. This shift in power gave Kilij Arslan the freedom to destroy the Danishmend emirates of eastern Anatolia and also eject his brother Shahinshah from his lands near Ankara. Shahinshah, who was Manuel&#x27;s vassal, and the Danishmend emirs fled to the protection of Byzantium. In 1175 the peace between Byzantium and the Sultanate of Rûm fell apart when Kilij Arslan refused to hand over to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do by treaty, a considerable proportion of the territory he had recently conquered from the Danishmends.

==March==

The army gathered at Lopadion by Manuel was supposedly so large that it spread across ten miles, and marched towards the border with the Seljuks via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma and Antioch. Arslan tried to negotiate but Manuel was convinced of his superiority and rejected a new peace. He sent part of the army under Andronikos Vatatzes towards Amasia while his larger force marched towards the Seljuk capital at Iconium. Both routes were through heavily wooded regions, where the Turks could easily hide and set up ambushes; the army moving towards Amasia was destroyed in one such ambush. The Turks later displayed Andronikos&#x27;s head, impaled on a lance, during the fighting at Myriokephalon.

The Turks also destroyed crops and poisoned water supplies to make Manuel&#x27;s march more difficult. Arslan harassed the Byzantine army in order to force it into the Meander valley, and specifically the mountain pass of Tzivritze near the fortress of Myriokephalon. Once at the pass Manuel decided to attack, despite the danger from further ambushes, and also despite the fact that he could have attempted to bring the Turks out of their positions to fight them on the nearby plain of Philomelion, the site of an earlier victory won by his grandfather Alexios. The lack of forage, and water for his troops, and the fact that dysentery had broken out in his army may have induced Manuel to decide to force the pass regardless of the danger of ambush.

==Army numbers and organisation==
===Byzantines===
All sources agree that the Byzantine force was of exceptional size. The historian John Haldon estimates the army at 25,000–30,000 men, while John Birkenmeier puts it at around 35,000 men. The latter number is derived from the fact that sources indicated a supply train of 3,000 wagons accompanied the army, which was enough to support 30,000–40,000 men. Birkenmeier believes that the army contained 25,000 Byzantine troops with the remainder composed of an allied contingent of Hungarians sent by Manuel&#x27;s kinsman Béla III of Hungary and tributary forces supplied by the Principality of Antioch and Serbia.

The Byzantine army was divided into a number of divisions, which entered the pass in the following order: a vanguard, largely of infantry (the other divisions being composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry); the main division (of eastern and western &quot;Tagmata&quot;); then the right wing (largely composed of Antiochenes and other Westerners), led by Baldwin of Antioch (Manuel&#x27;s brother-in-law); the baggage and siege trains; the Byzantine left wing, led by Theodore Mavrozomes and John Kantakouzenos; the emperor and his picked troops; and finally the rear division under the experienced general Andronikos Kontostephanos.

===Seljuks===
No estimates of Seljuk numbers for the battle have been possible. Primary sources have provided figures for other Seljuk campaigns. In 1160, John Kontostephanos defeated a force of 22,000 Seljuk Turks and about 20,000–24,000 Turks invaded the Maeander river valley in 1177. However, modern historians have estimated that the various Seljuk successor states (such as the Sultanate of Rum) could field at most 10,000–15,000 men. This is likely a closer estimate for the possible Seljuk strength at Myriokephalon considering the much larger and united Seljuk Empire fielded around 20,000–30,000 men at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Sultanate of Rum was much smaller territorially than the Seljuk Empire and probably had smaller armies, for example, its army at the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1097 has been estimated at between 6,000–8,000 men.

The Seljuk army consisted of two main sections: the &quot;askar&quot;s of the sultan and of each of his emirs, and an irregular force of Turkoman tribesmen. The &quot;askari&quot; (Arabic for &#x27;soldier&#x27;) was a full-time soldier, often a mamluk, a type of slave-soldier though this form of nominal slavery was not servile. They were supported by payments in cash or though a semi-feudal system of grants, called &quot;iqta&#x27;&quot;. These troops formed the core of field armies and were medium to heavy cavalry; they were armoured, and fought in coherent units with bow and lance. In contrast, the Turkoman tribesmen were semi-nomadic irregular horsemen, who served under their own chieftains. They lived off their herds and served the sultan on the promise of plunder, the ransom of prisoners, for one-off payments, or if their pasturelands were threatened. These tribesmen were unreliable as soldiers, but were numerous, and were effective as light mounted archers, adept at skirmish tactics.
==Battle==
The Byzantine vanguard was the first to encounter Arslan&#x27;s troops, and went through the pass with few casualties, as did the main division. Possibly the Turks had not yet fully deployed in their positions. These divisions sent their infantry up onto the slopes to dislodge the Seljuk soldiers, who were forced to withdraw to higher ground. The following divisions did not take this precaution, also they were negligent in not maintaining a defensive formation of closed ranks and they did not deploy their archers effectively. By the time the first two Byzantine divisions exited the far end of the pass, the rear was just about to enter; this allowed the Turks to close their trap on those divisions still within the pass. The Turkish attack, descending from the heights, fell especially heavily on the Byzantine right wing. This division seems to have quickly lost cohesion and been broken, soldiers fleeing one ambush often running into another. Heavy casualties were sustained by the right-wing and its commander, Baldwin, was killed. The Turks then concentrated their attacks on the baggage and siege trains, shooting down the draught animals and choking the roadway. The left-wing division also suffered significant casualties and one of its leaders, John Kantakouzenos, was slain when fighting alone against a band of Seljuk soldiers. The remaining Byzantine troops were panicked by the carnage in front of them and the realisation that the Turks had also begun to attack their rear. The sudden descent of a blinding dust-storm did nothing to improve the morale or organisation of the Byzantine forces, though it must have confused the Seljuk troops also. At this point, Manuel seems to have suffered a crisis of confidence and reputedly sat down, passively awaiting his fate and that of his army.

The emperor was eventually roused by his officers, re-established discipline and organised his forces into a defensive formation; when formed up, they pushed their way past the wreck of the baggage and out of the pass. Debouching from the pass they rejoined the unscathed van and main divisions, commanded by John and Andronikos Angelos, Constantine Makrodoukas and Andronikos Lampardas. Whilst the rest of the army had been under attack in the pass the troops of the van and main divisions had constructed a fortified encampment. The rear division, under Andronikos Kontostephanos, arrived at the camp somewhat later than the emperor, having suffered few casualties.

The night was spent in successfully repulsing further attacks by Seljuk mounted archers. Niketas Choniates states that Manuel considered abandoning his troops but was shamed into staying by the scathing words of an anonymous soldier and the disapproval of a shocked Kontostephanos. However, this would appear to be hyperbole on the historian&#x27;s part as Manuel would have placed himself in much greater danger by flight than if he remained in the midst of his army. The following day, the Turks circled the camp firing arrows; Manuel ordered two counterattacks, led by John Angelos and Constantine Makrodoukas respectively, but there was no renewal of a general action.

==Outcome==
Both sides, it appears, had suffered casualties, though their extent is difficult to quantify. Modern historians have postulated that about half of the Byzantine army was engaged and around half of those became casualties. As the Byzantine army moved back through the pass after the battle it was seen that the dead had been scalped and their genitals mutilated, &quot;It was said that the Turks took these measures so that the circumcised could not be distinguished from the uncircumcised and the victory therefore disputed and contested since many had fallen on both sides.&quot; Most importantly Manuel&#x27;s siege equipment had been captured and destroyed. The Byzantines, without any means of attacking Iconium, were now no longer in a position to continue the campaign. Also the Seljuk Sultan was keen for peace to be restored as soon as possible; he sent an envoy named Gabras, together with gifts of a Nisaean warhorse and a sword, to Manuel in order to negotiate a truce. As a result of these negotiations, the Byzantine army was to be allowed to retreat unmolested on condition that Manuel destroy his forts and evacuate the garrisons at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum in the Byzantine-Seljuk borderlands. However, despite Kilij Arslan&#x27;s protestations of good faith, the retreat of the Byzantine army was harassed by the attacks of Turkoman tribesmen (over whom Kilij Arslan probably had very little control). This, taken with an earlier failure by the sultan to keep his side of a treaty signed in 1162, gave Manuel an excuse to avoid observing the terms of this new arrangement in their entirety. He therefore demolished the fortifications of the less important fortress of Sublaeum but left Dorylaeum intact.

Manuel himself compared his defeat to that of Manzikert, sending a message to Constantinople ahead of his army likening his fate to that of Romanos Diogenes. However, in the same message he: &quot;Then extolled the treaties made with the sultan, boasting that these had been concluded beneath his own banner which had waved in the wind in view of the enemy&#x27;s front line so that trembling and fear fell upon them.&quot; It is notable that it was the sultan who initiated peace proposals by sending an envoy to Manuel and not the reverse. The conclusion that Kilij Arslan, though negotiating from a position of strength, did not consider that his forces were capable of destroying the Byzantine army is inescapable. A possible reason for Kilij Arslan&#x27;s reluctance to renew the battle is that a large proportion of his irregular troops may have been far more interested in securing the plunder they had taken than in continuing the fight, thus leaving his army seriously weakened.

==Aftermath==
Myriokephalon, although a significant defeat for the Byzantines, did not materially affect the capabilities of the Byzantine army. This is underlined by the notable victory the Byzantines won over the Seljuks at Hyelion and Leimocheir on the Meander River the following year. Ironically, this battle was a reverse of Myriokephalon, with a Seljuk army blundering into a classic ambush laid by the Byzantine general John Komnenos Vatatzes. Manuel continued to meet the Seljuks in smaller battles with some success, and concluded a probably advantageous peace with Kilij Arslan in 1179. However, like Manzikert, Myriokephalon was a pivotal event and following it the balance between the two powers in Anatolia gradually began to shift, and subsequently, Byzantium was unable to compete for dominance of the Anatolian interior.

Myriokephalon had more of a psychological impact than a military impact, as it proved that the Empire could not destroy Seljuk power in central Anatolia, despite the advances made during Manuel&#x27;s reign. One view is that Manuel had allowed himself to be distracted by a series of military adventures in Italy and Egypt, instead of dealing with the more pressing issue of the Turks. However, it has been argued that Manuel&#x27;s preoccupation with exerting influence over the Latins of Europe and the Crusader states of the Levant was aimed at ensuring Byzantine security in the Balkans and Anatolia. This ambition had drawn Manuel into neglecting matters closer to home, which the campaign of 1176 was aimed at rectifying. The period of peace with Byzantium had given the Sultan many years in which to eliminate his rivals, enabling him to build up a force capable of facing the Byzantine army in the field. Without the years required to build up Seljuk military power, the battle could not have taken place. Furthermore, during the campaign, Manuel made several serious tactical errors, such as failing to scout out the route ahead effectively and ignoring the advice of his senior officers. These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. However, in defence of Manuel&#x27;s generalship it is clear that he organised his army in a very effective manner. The army was composed of a number of &#x27;divisions&#x27;, each of which was self-reliant and could act as a small independent army; it has been argued that it was this organisation which allowed the greater part of his army to survive the ambush inflicted on it.

An important facet of Manuel&#x27;s dispositions was that the vanguard was composed of infantry. Infantry are far better troops than cavalry when operating in mountainous terrain and it appears that the infantry van was meant to dislodge any Seljuk soldiery from the high ground dominating the pass. They signally failed to sweep the Seljuks from the pass and this failure was a major cause of the Byzantine defeat. Added to this there seems to have been a failure in generalship by the commanders of the right and left wings, who did not deploy their troops as effectively as had the commanders of the two leading divisions.

After Manuel&#x27;s death, the empire drifted into anarchy, and it was never again in a position to mount a major offensive in the east. The defeat of Myriokephalon marked the end of Byzantine attempts to recover the Anatolian plateau, which was now lost to the empire forever.

<text>Donald Robert Perry Marquis ( ; July 29, 1878 – December 29, 1937) was an American humorist, journalist, and author. He was variously a novelist, poet, newspaper columnist, and playwright. He is remembered best for creating the characters Archy and Mehitabel, supposed authors of humorous verse. During his lifetime he was equally famous for creating another fictitious character, &quot;the Old Soak,&quot; who was the subject of two books, a hit Broadway play (1922–23), a silent film (1926) and a talkie (1937).

==Life==
Marquis was born and grew up in Walnut, Illinois. His brother David died in 1892 at the age of 20; his father James died in 1897. After graduating from Walnut High School in 1894, he attended Knox Academy, a now-defunct preparatory program run by Knox College, in 1896, but left after three months 

In 1909, Marquis married Reina Melcher, with whom he had a son, Robert (1915–1921) and a daughter, Barbara (1918–1931). 

Reina died on December 2, 1923, and three years later Marquis married the actress Marjorie Potts Vonnegut, whose first husband, actor Walter Vonnegut, was a cousin of Kurt Vonnegut Jr., the bestselling author, playwright and satirist. Marjorie died in her sleep on October 25, 1936.

Marquis died of a stroke in New York City, after suffering three other strokes that partly disabled him.

On August 23, 1943, the United States Navy christened a Liberty ship, the , in his memory.

==Career==
From 1902 to 1907 Marquis served on the editorial board of the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; where he wrote many editorials during the heated gubernatorial election between his publisher Hoke Smith and future Pulitzer Prize winner, Clark Howell (Smith was the victor).

In 1912 he began work for the &quot;New York Evening Sun&quot;, and edited for the next eleven years a daily column, &quot;The Sun Dial&quot;. In 1922 he left &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; (shortened to The Sun in 1920) for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; (renamed the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in 1924), where his daily column, &quot;The Tower&quot; (later &quot;The Lantern&quot;) was a great success. He regularly contributed columns and short stories to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;American&quot; magazines and also appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Golden Book&quot;, and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

Marquis&#x27;s best-known creation was Archy, a fictional cockroach (developed as a character during 1916) who had been a free-verse poet in a previous life, and who supposedly left poems on Marquis&#x27;s typewriter by jumping on the keys. Archy usually typed only lower-case letters, without punctuation, because he could not operate the shift key. His verses were a type of social satire, and were used by Marquis in his newspaper columns titled &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot;; mehitabel was an alley cat, occasional companion of archy and the subject of some of archy&#x27;s verses. The archy and mehitabel pieces were illustrated by cartoonist George Herriman, better known to posterity as the author of the newspaper comic Krazy Kat. Other characters developed by Marquis included Pete the Pup, Clarence the ghost, and an egomaniacal toad named Warty Bliggins.

Marquis was the author of about 35 books. He co-wrote (or contributed posthumously to) the films &quot;The Sports Pages&quot;, &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;, &quot;The Good Old Soak&quot; and &quot;Skippy&quot;. The 1926 film &quot;The Cruise of the Jasper B&quot; was supposedly based on his 1916 novel of the same name, although the plots have little in common.

<text>John Carroll O&#x27;Connor (August2, 1924– June21, 2001) was an American actor whose television career spanned over four decades. He found widespread fame as Archie Bunker (for which he won four Emmy Awards), the main character in the CBS television sitcoms &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1979) and its continuation, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; (1979–1983). He later starred in the NBC/CBS television crime drama &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1988–1995), where he played the role of police chief William &quot;Bill&quot; Gillespie. In the late 1990s, he played Gus Stemple, the father of Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt) on &quot;Mad About You&quot;. In 1996, O&#x27;Connor was ranked number 38 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. He won five Emmys and one Golden Globe Award.

==Early life==
Carroll O&#x27;Connor, the eldest of three sons, was born on August2, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, to Edward Joseph O&#x27;Connor, a lawyer, and his wife, Elise Patricia O&#x27;Connor (née O&#x27;Connor), a teacher. Both of his brothers became doctors: Hugh, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1961, and Robert, a psychiatrist in New York City. O&#x27;Connor spent much of his youth in Elmhurst and Forest Hills, Queens, which is where his character Archie Bunker would later live.

O&#x27;Connor graduated from Newtown High School in Elmhurst. In 1941, he enrolled at Wake Forest University in North Carolina but dropped out when the United States entered World War II. During the war, he was rejected by the United States Navy and enrolled in the United States Merchant Marine Academy for a short time. After leaving that institution, he became a merchant seaman and served in the United States Merchant Marine during the war.

After the war, O&#x27;Connor attended the University of Montana, where he worked at the &quot;Montana Kaimin&quot; student newspaper as an editor; in 1949 he resigned his editing position in protest to the pressure from the campus administration that led to the confiscation and destruction of an issue of the paper, which carried a cartoon depicting the Montana Board of Education as rats gnawing at a bag of university funds. At the University of Montana, he also joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. O&#x27;Connor did not take any drama courses as an undergraduate at the University of Montana, but he did act in student theater productions. He met Nancy Fields (born 1929), who later became his wife, when she was working as a makeup artist and lighting technician in a student-produced production of &quot;Our Town&quot;. He later left that university to help his younger brother Hugh get into medical school in Ireland, where Carroll completed his undergraduate studies at University College Dublin. There he studied Irish history and English literature, graduated in 1952, and began his acting career.

After O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s fiancée, Nancy Fields, graduated from the University of Montana in 1951 with degrees in drama and English, she sailed to Ireland to study at Trinity College Dublin and met Carroll, who was visiting his brother, Hugh. The couple married in Dublin on July28, 1951. In 1956, O&#x27;Connor returned to the University of Montana to earn a master&#x27;s degree in speech.

== Career ==

=== Prolific character actor ===
After acting in theatrical productions in Dublin and New York during the 1950s, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s breakthrough came when he was cast by director Burgess Meredith (assisted by John Astin) in a featured role in the Broadway adaptation of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. O&#x27;Connor and Meredith remained close, lifelong friends.

O&#x27;Connor made his television acting debut as a character actor on two episodes of &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot; in 1960. These two parts led to other roles on such television series as &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Insight&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, among many others. O&#x27;Connor guest-starred as Josef Varsh in the first season of &quot;&quot;, season one, episode 18 &quot;The Trial&quot;. Late in his career, he appeared on several episodes of &quot;Mad About You&quot; as the father of Helen Hunt&#x27;s character.

He was among the actors considered for the roles of the Skipper on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and Dr. Smith in the TV show &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, and he was the visual template in the creation of Batman nemesis Rupert Thorne, a character who debuted at the height of &quot;All in the Family&quot; success in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No. 469 (published May 1976 by DC Comics).

===Early film roles===

O&#x27;Connor appeared in a number of studio films in the 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962), &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965), &quot;What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?&quot; (1966), &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), &quot;Not with My Wife, You Don&#x27;t!&quot; (1966), &quot;Warning Shot&quot; (1967), &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968), &quot;For Love of Ivy&quot; (1968), &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot; (1969), &quot;Marlowe&quot; (1969), &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970) and &quot;Doctors&#x27; Wives&quot; (1971). In many of his roles he portrayed a military or police officer, in several a particularly blustery one.

===Television roles===

In the 1960s, O&#x27;Connor appeared in episodes of notable television series such as &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1966 - &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;; S12E7).

O&#x27;Connor also performed in anthology television shows such as &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Play of the Week&quot;, &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; and &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre.&quot;

====&quot;All in the Family&quot;====

O&#x27;Connor was living in Italy in 1968 when producer Norman Lear asked him to come to New York City and star in a series that he was creating for ABC titled &quot;Justice For All.&quot; Lear recruited O&#x27;Connor to play the role of Archie Justice, a bigot who was able to bring forth some measure of empathy from the audience. After two television pilots of the sitcom were produced (between 1968 and 1970), the hosting network was changed to CBS. For the third pilot, the last name of its main character was changed to Bunker, and its title was changed to &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The show was based on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, and Bunker was based on Alf Garnett, but he was somewhat less abrasive than the original British character.
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Queens background and his ability to speak with a working-class New York accent both influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.

Desiring a well known actor to play the lead, Lear approached Mickey Rooney, but he declined the role. O&#x27;Connor accepted the role because he did not expect the show to succeed, and he believed that he would move back to Europe when it failed. In her book &quot;Archie &amp; Edith, Mike &amp; Gloria: the Tumultuous History of All in the Family&quot;, Donna McCrohan revealed that O&#x27;Connor had requested that Lear provide him with a return airplane ticket to Rome as a condition of his acceptance of the role so that he could return to Italy when the show failed. Instead, &quot;All in the Family&quot; became the highest-rated show on American television for five consecutive seasons.

While O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s personal politics were liberal, he understood the Bunker character and played him not only with bombast and humor but with touches of vulnerability. The show&#x27;s writing was consistently left of center, but O&#x27;Connor, while his character held right-wing views, could also deftly skewer the liberal pieties of the day. Bunker was famous for his English language malapropisms, but O&#x27;Connor was in truth a highly educated and cultured man and taught English before he turned to acting. Archie Bunker&#x27;s long-suffering wife Edith was played by Jean Stapleton, also from New York City, a Broadway actress whom Lear remembered from the play and film &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. The show also starred then-unknown character actors Rob Reiner as Archie&#x27;s liberal son-in-law Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic and Sally Struthers as Gloria, Archie and Edith&#x27;s only child and Mike&#x27;s wife.

CBS debated whether the controversial subject matter of &quot;All in the Family&quot; would mesh with a sitcom. Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, sexuality, class, education, women&#x27;s equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam War, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed. Like its British predecessor &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, the show lent dramatic social substance to the traditional sitcom format. Archie Bunker&#x27;s popularity made O&#x27;Connor a top-billing star of the 1970s. O&#x27;Connor was apprehensive of being typecast for playing the role, but at the same time he was protective, not just of his character, but of the entire show.

A contract dispute between O&#x27;Connor and Lear marred the beginning of the show&#x27;s fifth season. Eventually O&#x27;Connor received a raise and appeared in the series until it ended. For his work as Archie Bunker, he was nominated for eight Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series; he won the award four times (1972, 1977, 1978 and 1979). At the end of the eighth season in 1978, Reiner and Struthers left the series to pursue other projects.

Rob Reiner said in a 2014 interview about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O&#x27;Connor: &quot;We did over 200 shows in front of a live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don&#x27;t like, how stories are structured. I would spend a lot of time in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O&#x27;Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn&#x27;t have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it&#x27;s good. I had great people around me, and I took from all the people who were around.&quot; Comparing O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s character to Archie Bunker, Reiner said: &quot;Carroll O&#x27;Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He&#x27;s still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s all good or all bad.&quot;

====&quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;====

When &quot;All in the Family&quot; ended after nine seasons, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; continued in its place and ran for four additional years. Longtime friend and original series star Jean Stapleton appeared as Edith Bunker on the new show, but made only five guest appearances in Season 1. Stapleton decided she did not want to continue in the role, and in the second-season premiere, her character died of a stroke, leaving Archie to cope with the loss. At the time, O&#x27;Connor was receiving $200,000 an episode, making him one of the highest paid stars on television. The show was canceled in 1983. O&#x27;Connor was angered about the show&#x27;s cancellation, maintaining that the show ended with an inappropriate finale. He would later work for CBS again when he starred in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; on NBC and they decided not to renew the series. CBS allowed the series to continue for two more years and have a proper ending.

====&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;====

While coping with his son&#x27;s drug problem, O&#x27;Connor starred as Sparta, Mississippi, Police Chief Bill Gillespie, a tough veteran cop on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. Based on the novel by John Ball and the 1967 movie of the same name, the series debuted on NBC in March 1988 and performed well. He cast his inexperienced son Hugh O&#x27;Connor as Officer Lonnie Jamison. The headquarters of the Sparta Police Department was actually the library in Covington, Georgia.

In 1989, while working on the set, O&#x27;Connor was hospitalized and underwent open heart surgery, which caused him to miss four episodes at the end of the second season. (Actor Joe Don Baker took his place in those episodes as an acting police chief.) O&#x27;Connor would later serve as one of the executive producers for the series, starting with the third season. The series was transferred from NBC to CBS in 1992 and cancelled two years later after its seventh season. O&#x27;Connor reprised his role the following year for four two-hour &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; television films.

While on the series, O&#x27;Connor recorded &quot;Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella&quot; for the 1991 &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; Christmas CD &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27;. He was joined by Grand Ole Opry star mandolinist Jesse McReynolds, Nashville accordionist Abe Manuel Jr., and Nashville fiddlers Buddy Spicher and Randall Franks. CD Producer and series co-star Randall Franks created the arrangement which was co-produced by series co-star Alan Autry. He joined other members of the cast for a recording of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; with vocals by Country Music Hall of Fame members Little Jimmy Dickens, Kitty Wells, Pee Wee King, The Marksmen Quartet, Bobby Wright, Johnnie Wright and Ken Holloway. According to MeTV, Carroll wrote several episodes under the pseudonym Matt Harris.

===Other honors===
He became a lifelong member of the Actors Studio in 1971. 

In 1973, his fraternity conferred its highest honor, the Sigma Phi Epsilon Citation, on him.

O&#x27;Connor is the only male actor to have won the lead acting Emmy Award in both the comedy and drama series categories.

In July 1991, O&#x27;Connor, Jean Stapleton, Reiner, and Sally Struthers reunited to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. With reruns airing in syndication on TV Land, Antenna TV and CBS, the show&#x27;s popularity continued.

In March 2000, O&#x27;Connor received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was given a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day tribute by MGM.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s caricature is displayed at Sardi&#x27;s restaurant in New York City&#x27;s Theater District.

==Personal life==
In 1962, while he was in Rome filming &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, O&#x27;Connor and his wife Nancy Fields O&#x27;Connor adopted a six-day-old boy, naming him Hugh after O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s brother who had died a year earlier. At age 17, Hugh worked as a courier on the set of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. O&#x27;Connor eventually created the role of Officer Lonnie Jamison on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; for his son.

O&#x27;Connor was a devout Catholic who regularly attended Mass.

In 1989, O&#x27;Connor was admitted to the hospital for heart bypass surgery and quit his 30-year smoking habit.

On March 28, 1995, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s son Hugh died by suicide after a long time struggle with drug addiction. Following his son&#x27;s death, O&#x27;Connor appeared in public service announcements for the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and spent the rest of his life working to raise awareness about drug addiction. O&#x27;Connor also successfully lobbied the state of California to pass legislation allowing family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer&#x27;s actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment, rehabilitation costs and other economic and noneconomic damages. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Civil Liability Act, went into effect in 1997. It is also referred to as the Hugh O&#x27;Connor Memorial Law. The act is based on the 1992 Model Drug Dealer Liability Act, which has been passed in 17 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Cases have been brought under the act in states such as California, Illinois, and Utah.

His son&#x27;s suicide inspired him to start a crusade against the man who had sold the drugs to Hugh. He called Harry Perzigian &quot;a partner in murder&quot; and a &quot;sleazeball&quot;, and Perzigian countered with a defamation lawsuit against O&#x27;Connor. In 1997, a California jury decided in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s favor. In an interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; soon after the verdict, O&#x27;Connor said that he would never be able to put his son&#x27;s death behind him, saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t forget it. There isn&#x27;t a day that I don&#x27;t think of him and want him back and miss him, and I&#x27;ll feel that way until I&#x27;m not here anymore.&quot;

During the late 1990s, O&#x27;Connor established a small automotive restoration shop in Newbury Park, California. Called Carroll O&#x27;Connor Classics, the shop contained many of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s personal vehicles and the cars once owned by his late son. Among the cars O&#x27;Connor owned were a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow sold to him by William Harrah, a Maserati 3500 GT, and a Dodge Challenger equipped with a 440-cubic inch V-8, which he drove during production of &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

In 1997, the O&#x27;Connors donated US$1 million () to their alma mater to help match a challenge grant to the University of Montana from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The university named a regional studies and public policy institute the O&#x27;Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West. Afterward, O&#x27;Connor taught screenwriting at the university.

In 1998, O&#x27;Connor underwent a second surgery to clear the blockage in a carotid artery in order to reduce his risk of stroke.

==Death==

O&#x27;Connor died at age 76 on June 21, 2001, in Culver City, California, from a heart attack brought on by complications from diabetes. His funeral mass was celebrated at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, and was attended by &quot;All in the Family&quot; cast members Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, and Danielle Brisebois, as well as producer Norman Lear. Jean Stapleton, a close friend of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s since the early 1960s, was unable to attend the service because of a commitment for a stage performance.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s best friend Larry Hagman and his family attended the funeral, along with the surviving cast of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, including Alan Autry and Denise Nicholas. Actor Martin Sheen, then starring on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, delivered the eulogy. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery with his son Hugh&#x27;s cenotaph placed on his gravestone.

In honor of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s career, TV Land moved an entire weekend of programming to the next week and showed a continuous marathon of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. During the commercial breaks, TV Land also showed interview footage of O&#x27;Connor and various &quot;All in the Family&quot; actors, producers with whom he had worked, and other associates. His wife Nancy Fields O&#x27;Connor died on November 10, 2014, at age 84.

<doc id="245807" wikidata="Q3445541" url="?curid=245807" title="Cheyney University of Pennsylvania">
<text>Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is a public historically black university in Cheyney, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1837 as the Institute for Colored Youth, it is the oldest of all historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the United States. It is a member of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The university offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
Built on land donated by the prominent Cheyney family, the university was founded as the African Institute in February 1837 and renamed the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in April 1837. The African Institute was founded by Richard Humphreys, a Quaker philanthropist who bequeathed $10,000 (), one-tenth of his estate, to design and establish a school to educate people of African descent and prepare them as teachers.
Born on a plantation on Tortola, an island in the British West Indies, Humphreys came to Philadelphia in 1764. Many Quakers were abolitionists, and he became concerned about the struggles of free people of color to make a living and gain education in a discriminatory society. News of a race riot against free African-Americans in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1829 inspired Humphreys to bequeath money in his will for higher education for free blacks. He charged thirteen fellow Quakers to design an institution &quot;to instruct the descendants of the African Race in school learning, in the various branches of the mechanic Arts, trades and Agriculture, in order to prepare and fit and qualify them to act as teachers ...&quot;
Founded as the African Institute, the school was soon renamed the Institute for Colored Youth. In its early years, it provided training in trades and agriculture, as those were the predominant skills needed in the general economy. In 1902, the institute was relocated to George Cheyney&#x27;s farm, a 275-acre property west of Philadelphia. The name &quot;Cheyney&quot; became associated with the school in 1913. The school&#x27;s official name changed several times during the 20th century. In 1983, Cheyney was taken into the State System of Higher Education as Cheyney University of Pennsylvania.

The university has traditionally offered opportunities to many students from Philadelphia&#x27;s inner city schools. Its alumni have close ties in the city and state. It became part of a 1980 civil rights lawsuit against the state government; it alleged that the state had unlawfully underfunded the historically black university. The suit was settled 19 years later in 1999. This was five years after the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office of Civil Rights began investigating states &quot;that once practiced segregation in higher education and were never officially found to have eliminated it.&quot; In the settlement, the state agreed to provide $35 million to Cheyney over a five-year period, particularly for construction of needed buildings and academic development. By comparison, the university had an annual budget of about $23 million at the time.

In November 2015, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education placed Cheyney University on probation. Three years later, the commission placed the university on &quot;show cause&quot; status which required the university to show cause by November 21, 2019, for showing compliance with the commission&#x27;s standards or accreditation would not be renewed. The accreditation concerns were driven by the university&#x27;s financial woes, a concern the university sought to address in part with increased fundraising.

On November 21, 2019, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education reaffirmed Cheyney&#x27;s accreditation as &quot;...the institution is now in compliance with Standard VI (Planning, Resources, and Institutional Improvement) and Requirement of Affiliation 11.&quot; Four years later, in 2023, the commission again placed Cheyney on probation and warned that accreditation was in jeopardy because of insufficient evidence that it was complying with a number of standards. The warning was lifted the following year.

==Campus==
The university is partially in Thornbury Township, Chester County, and partially in Thornbury Township, Delaware County.

==Athletics==
Cheyney University has one of the most storied basketball programs in NCAA Division II history. The men&#x27;s basketball program is 7th all-time in NCAA win percentage, including 16 PSAC conference championships, four Final Fours, and one National Championship (1978). The women&#x27;s basketball team in 1982 competed in the championship game of the inaugural NCAA Division I tournament despite being a Division II school.

In 2009, Cheyney University hired the first ever NCAA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball coaches who are brother and sister. The men&#x27;s coach was Dominique Stephens, a North Carolina Central University graduate and member of the NCAA Division II Basketball Championship team, and the women&#x27;s coach was Marilyn Stephens, the Temple University Hall of Famer.

During the 2007–2008 through 2010–2011 academic years, the university violated NCAA rules in the certification of initial, transfer and continuing eligibility involving all sports programs. During the four-year period, numerous student-athletes competed while ineligible due to improper certification. In amateurism certification alone, 109 student-athletes practiced, competed and received travel expenses and/or athletically related financial aid before the university received their amateurism certification status from the NCAA Eligibility Center. The committee also concluded that a former compliance director failed to monitor when she did not follow proper procedures in the certification of student-athletes’ eligibility. The entire athletics program was on probation until August 2019. In spring 2018, the team withdrew from Division II and played the following season as an independent, citing financial problems.

== Student life ==
All nine National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) organizations are present on Cheyney University&#x27;s campus.

<doc id="245808" wikidata="Q129493" url="?curid=245808" title="Golden Legend">
<text>The Golden Legend ( or &quot;Legenda sanctorum&quot;) is a collection of 153 hagiographies by Jacobus de Voragine that was widely read in Europe during the Late Middle Ages. More than a thousand manuscripts of the text have survived. It was probably compiled around 1259 to 1266, although the text was added to over the centuries.

Initially entitled &quot;Legenda sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Readings of the Saints&quot;), it gained its popularity under the title by which it is best known. It overtook and eclipsed earlier compilations of abridged legendaria, the &quot;Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum&quot; attributed to the Dominican chronicler Jean de Mailly and the &quot;Epilogus in gestis sanctorum&quot; of the Dominican preacher Bartholomew of Trent. When printing was invented in the 1450s, editions appeared quickly, not only in Latin, but also in almost every major European language. Among &quot;incunabula&quot;, printed before 1501, &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; was printed in more editions than the Bible and was one of the most widely published books of the Middle Ages. During the height of its popularity the book was so well known that the term &quot;Golden Legend&quot; was sometimes used generally to refer to any collection of stories about the saints. It was one of the first books William Caxton printed in the English language; Caxton&#x27;s version appeared in 1483 and his translation was reprinted, reaching a ninth edition in 1527. 

Written in simple, readable Latin, the book was read in its day for its stories. Each chapter is about a different saint or Christian festival. The book is considered the closest thing to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today; as such, it is invaluable to art historians and medievalists who seek to identify saints depicted in art by their deeds and attributes. Its repetitious nature is explained if Jacobus meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for sermons and preaching, not a work of popular entertainment.

==Lives of the saints==
The book sought to compile traditional lore about saints venerated at the time of its compilation, ordered according to their feast days. Jacobus de Voragine for the most part follows a template for each chapter: etymology of the saint&#x27;s name, a narrative about their life, a list of miracles performed, and finally a list of citations where the information was found.

Each chapter typically begins with an etymology for the saint&#x27;s name, &quot;often entirely fanciful&quot;. An example (in Caxton&#x27;s translation) shows his method:

As a Latin author, Jacobus de Voragine must have known that &quot;Silvester&quot;, a relatively common Latin name, simply meant &quot;from the forest&quot;. The correct derivation is alluded to in the text, but set out in parallel to fanciful ones that lexicographers would consider quite wide of the mark. Even the &quot;correct&quot; explanations (&quot;silvas&quot;, &quot;forest&quot;, and the mention of green boughs) are used as the basis for an allegorical interpretation. Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s etymologies had different goals from modern etymologies, and cannot be judged by the same standards. Jacobus&#x27; etymologies have parallels in Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, in which linguistically accurate derivations are set out beside allegorical and figurative explanations.

Jacobus de Voragine then moves on to the saint&#x27;s life, compiled with reference to the readings from the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s liturgy commemorating that saint; then embellishes the biography with supernatural tales of incidents involving the saint&#x27;s life.

===Medieval view of Muhammad===
The chapter &quot;St Pelagius, Pope and the History of the Lombards&quot; begins with the story of St Pelagius, then proceeds to touch upon events surrounding the origin and history of the Lombards in Europe leading up to the 7th century when the story of Muhammad begins. The story then goes on to describe &quot;Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)&quot; as &quot;a false prophet and sorcerer&quot;, detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow Khadija, and goes on to suggest that his religious visions came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade Nestorian monk named Sergius. The chapter conveys the medieval Christian understanding of the beliefs of Saracens and other Muslims. It may be because of this long history that early copies of the entire work were sometimes referred to as Historia Lombardica.
===Miracle tales of relics===
Many of the stories also conclude with miracle tales and similar wonderlore from accounts of those who called upon that saint for aid or used the saint&#x27;s relics. Such a tale is told of Saint Agatha; Jacobus da Varagine has pagans in Catania repairing to the relics of St. Agatha to supernaturally repel an eruption of Mount Etna:

And for to prove that she had prayed for the salvation of the country, at the beginning of February, the year after her martyrdom, there arose a great fire, and came from the mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt the earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then ran the paynims to the sepulchre of S. Agatha and took the cloth that lay upon her tomb, and held it abroad against the fire, and anon on the ninth day after, which was the day of her feast, ceased the fire as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought from her tomb, showing that our Lord kept the city from the said fire by the merits of S. Agatha.

Jacobus carefully lists many of the sources he used to collect his stories, with more than 120 total sources listed; among the three most important are &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; by Eusebius, &quot;Tripartite History&quot; by Cassiodorus, and &quot;Historia scholastica&quot; by Petrus Comestor.

However, scholars have also identified other sources which Jacobus did not himself credit. A substantial portion of Jacobus&#x27; text was drawn from two epitomes of collected lives of the saints, both also arranged in the order of the liturgical year, written by members of his Dominican order: one is Jean de Mailly&#x27;s lengthy &quot;Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints&quot;) and the other is Bartholomew of Trent&#x27;s &quot;Epilogum in gesta sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints&quot;). The many extended parallels to text found in Vincent de Beauvais&#x27; &quot;Speculum historiale&quot;, the main encyclopedia that was used in the Middle Ages, are attributed by modern scholars to the two authors&#x27; common compilation of identical sources, rather than to Jacobus&#x27; reading Vincent&#x27;s encyclopedia. More than 130 more distant sources have been identified for the tales related of the saints in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, few of which have a nucleus in the New Testament itself; these hagiographic sources include apocryphal texts such as the &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;, and the histories of Gregory of Tours and John Cassian. Many of his stories have no other known source. A typical example of the sort of story related, also involving St. Silvester, shows the saint receiving miraculous instruction from Saint Peter in a vision that enables him to exorcise a dragon:

In this time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pit, which every day slew with his breath more than three hundred men. Then came the bishops of the idols unto the emperor and said unto him: O thou most holy emperor, sith the time that thou hast received Christian faith the dragon which is in yonder fosse or pit slayeth every day with his breath more than three hundred men. Then sent the emperor for S. Silvester and asked counsel of him of this matter. S. Silvester answered that by the might of God he promised to make him cease of his hurt and blessure of this people. Then S. Silvester put himself to prayer, and S. Peter appeared to him and said: &quot;Go surely to the dragon and the two priests that be with thee take in thy company, and when thou shalt come to him thou shalt say to him in this manner: Our Lord Jesus Christ which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried and arose, and now sitteth on the right side of the Father, this is he that shall come to deem and judge the living and the dead, I commend thee Sathanas that thou abide him in this place till he come. Then thou shalt bind his mouth with a thread, and seal it with thy seal, wherein is the imprint of the cross. Then thou and the two priests shall come to me whole and safe, and such bread as I shall make ready for you ye shall eat.Thus as S. Peter had said, S. Silvester did. And when he came to the pit, he descended down one hundred and fifty steps, bearing with him two lanterns, and found the dragon, and said the words that S. Peter had said to him, and bound his mouth with the thread, and sealed it, and after returned, and as he came upward again he met with two enchanters which followed him for to see if he descended, which were almost dead of the stench of the dragon, whom he brought with him whole and sound, which anon were baptized, with a great multitude of people with them. Thus was the city of Rome delivered from double death, that was from the culture and worshiping of false idols, and from the venom of the dragon.

Jacobus describes the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch surviving being swallowed by a dragon as &quot;apocryphal and not to be taken seriously&quot; (trans. Ryan, 1.369).

==Perception and legacy==
The book was highly successful in its time, despite many other similar books that compiled legends of the saints. The reason it stood out against competing saint collections probably is that it offered the average reader the perfect balance of information. For example, compared to Jean de Mailly&#x27;s work &quot;Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints&quot;, which &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; largely borrowed from, Jacobus added chapters about the major feast days and removed some of the saints&#x27; chapters, which might have been more useful to the medieval reader.

Many different versions of the text exist, mostly due to copiers and printers adding additional content to it. Each time a new copy was made, it was common for that institution to add a chapter or two about their own local saints. Today more than 1,000 original manuscripts have been found, the earliest of which dates back to 1265.

===Contemporary influences and translations===
&quot;The Golden Legend&quot; had a big influence on scholarship and literature of the Middle Ages. According to research by Manfred Görlach, it influenced the &quot;South English Legendary&quot;, which was still being written when Jacobus&#x27; text came out. It was also a major source for John Mirk&#x27;s &quot;Festial&quot;, Osbern Bokenam&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Hooly Wummen&quot;, and the &quot;Scottish Legendary&quot;.

By the end of the Middle Ages, &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; had been translated into almost every major European language. The earliest surviving English translation is from 1438, and is cryptically signed by &quot;a synfulle wrecche&quot;. In 1483, the work was re-translated and printed by William Caxton under the name &quot;The Golden Legende&quot;, and subsequently reprinted many times due to the demand.

===16th-century rejection and 20th-century revival===
The adverse reaction to &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; under critical scrutiny in the 16th century was led by scholars who reexamined the criteria for judging hagiographic sources and found &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; wanting; prominent among the humanists were two disciples of Erasmus, Georg Witzel, in the preface to his &quot;Hagiologium&quot;, and Juan Luis Vives in &quot;De disciplinis&quot;. Criticism of Jacobus&#x27;s text was muted within the Dominican Order by the increasing reverence towards him as a Dominican and archbishop, which culminated in his beatification in 1815. The rehabilitation of &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; in the 20th century, now interpreted as a mirror of the heartfelt pieties of the 13th century, is attributed to Téodor de Wyzewa, whose 1901 retranslation into French, and its preface, have been often reprinted.

Sherry Reames argues that Jacobus&#x27; interpretation of his source material emphasized purity, detachment, great erudition and other rarified attributes of the saints; she contrasts this to the same saints as described in de Mailly&#x27;s &quot;Abbreviatio&quot;, whose virtues are more relatable, such as charity, humility and trust in God.

===Editions and translations ===

The critical edition of the Latin text has been edited by Giovanni Paolo Maggioni (Florence: SISMEL 1998). In 1900, the Caxton version was updated into more modern English by Frederick Startridge Ellis, and published in seven volumes. Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s original was translated into French around the same time by Téodor de Wyzewa. A modern English translation of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; has been published by William Granger Ryan, and (2 volumes).

A modern translation of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; is available from Fordham University&#x27;s Medieval Sourcebook.

<doc id="245819" wikidata="Q1070550" url="?curid=245819" title="Chesapeake Bayhawks">
<text>The Chesapeake Bayhawks were a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) professional men&#x27;s field lacrosse team based in Annapolis, Maryland. They played in the greater Baltimore metro area beginning with the MLL&#x27;s inaugural 2001 season, as the Baltimore Bayhawks from 2001 to 2006 and as the Washington Bayhawks from 2007 to 2009.

They won six Steinfeld Cup titles, the most of any MLL franchise.

==Franchise history==
===Early success===
The Bayhawks played two seasons at Homewood Field at Johns Hopkins University, in 2001 and 2003, while they played at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in downtown Baltimore in 2002. Their home moved to Johnny Unitas Stadium on the campus of Towson University from 2004 to 2006. They won National Division titles in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005 and made the 2004 playoffs as a wild card.

In 2001, the Bayhawks won the National Division crown, but fell short in the championship game to the Long Island Lizards. The following year, the Bayhawks repeated as National Division champions and this time avenged their title game loss by beating the Lizards to win their first MLL crown. In the MLL&#x27;s third season, the Bayhawks continued their National Division dominance with their third straight title, but again came up just short in the MLL Championship against the Lizards. The Bayhawks made the playoffs in 2004, but were eliminated in the semifinals.

The 2005 Bayhawks squad is regarded as one of the greatest lacrosse teams ever assembled. Led by hall-of-famers Gary Gait and Tom Marechek, the Bayhawks went 10–2, dominating the competition and setting several scoring records throughout the year. They scored 47 more goals than any other team and lead the league with fewest goals allowed, resulting in an average score of 20–13. The team capped the regular season with their fourth National Division title and their second MLL crown.

The Bayhawks were the only Major League Lacrosse team to have a winning season in each of the first five years of the league, posting a 44–19 record.

===Move to Washington, D.C.===
The 2006 season was a transition year for the Bayhawks. BT Lax Operating purchased the franchise from the prior ownership group led by the Pivec family. The Bayhawks went 4–8 and missed the playoffs for the first time in its history. Following the season, the new owners announced the team would be renamed the Washington Bayhawks and play around Washington, D.C..

The Washington Bayhawks played their first home game of the 2007 season at George Mason Stadium in Fairfax, Virginia with the subsequent five home games at Georgetown University&#x27;s Multi-Sport Field. George Mason Stadium served as the primary field for five home games during 2008 with one home game at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. Both years the Bayhawks produced losing records, 5–7 and 4–8.

In 2009, the Bayhawks returned to Maryland for good and signed a three-year agreement with the US Naval Academy for their home games. A permanent home did not help the Bayhawks on the field, they finished with another 5–7 season.

===Dynasty in Annapolis===
In March 2010, the Bayhawks announced a new ownership group, Hometown Lacrosse, LLC led by majority owner Brendan Kelly. The Bayhawks also announced that the team name would be changed to the Chesapeake Bayhawks to include all areas of the region from Northern Maryland to Virginia and Washington, D.C. to the Eastern Shore. The Bayhawks continued to play at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis. The team started out 4–6, leading Kelly to fire John Tucker and take over as head coach himself. With Kelly&#x27;s leadership, the team finished the 2010 season at 6–6 and made the playoffs for the first time since 2005. The Bayhawks defeated the Boston Cannons 13–9 in the semifinals, and won the Steinfeld Trophy for the third time with another 13–9 victory over their archrivals, the Long Island Lizards.

After a rollercoaster season and another 6–6 record in 2011, the Bayhawks were defeated by the Boston Cannons in a close match-up in the playoffs at home. In the off-season, the team made some major changes when Kelly stepped down as head coach and promoted Dave Cottle from assistant coach to head coach. Cottle immediately brought in Tony Resch to serve as his defensive coordinator. In 2012 they recaptured the Steinfeld Cup, defeating the Denver Outlaws 16–6 in the final.

The Bayhawks repeated as MLL champions in 2013, defeating the Charlotte Hounds 10–9 in the final.

===Playoff drought===

After their third title in four years in 2013, the Bayhawks missed the playoffs in the following four seasons, the second time in franchise history. In 2016, seven teams finished tied atop the standings at 8–6, including the Bayhawks. Due to tiebreaker procedures, the Bayhawks were left out of the playoffs.

In 2017, the Bayhawks started the season 3–1, but a four-game losing streak put them in a bad position at 3–5. The Bayhawks were finally able to regain some momentum but were ultimately eliminated with a loss during the second-to-last week of the regular season. They finished the season on a high note though, a 23–19 victory over the defending champion Denver Outlaws. In the game, rookie Josh Byrne scored seven goals and finished 2017 with the Major League Lacrosse record for goals in a season for a rookie with 39. The win put them at an even 7-7, but did not prevent them from extending their playoff drought to four seasons. On September 14, the Bayhawks announced that head coach Brian Reese would not be returning because the team wanted a full-time coach, the league&#x27;s first. On December 13, the Bayhawks announced they were bringing back Dave Cottle as head coach.

The Bayhawks were developing plans for a $40 million 10,000-seat stadium on the grounds of the former Crownsville State Hospital that would have included a three-story team headquarters. The project&#x27;s first phase would be a 6,000 seat amphitheater that the Bayhawks hope to be playing in by 2020, while phase two would include 20 youth fields but the local community raised significant objections to the plans.

===Cottle returns as head coach===
The Bayhawks new and old head coach Dave Cottle began the 2018 campaign at home against the Dallas Rattlers, who were playing in their first game since relocating from Rochester. The Rattlers defeated the Bayhawks 15–9. On April 28, the Bayhawks collected their first win of the season and Cottle&#x27;s second tenure with a 14–11 victory over the Florida Launch.

After a 1–2 start, the Bayhawks would rattle off seven straight victories, including back-to-back wins over the defending champion Ohio Machine, a team who swept them the season before. The Bayhawks would drop three of their last four contests of the regular season, but at 9–5, the team still earned second place and a home playoff game in the 2018 postseason.

In their first playoff appearance since 2013, the Bayhawks lost a close game to the Denver Outlaws, 13–12, despite defeating the Outlaws twice in the regular season. It was only the Bayhawks&#x27; second playoff loss in five trips to the postseason since becoming the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Bayhawks in 2010.

After the 2018 season, the professional lacrosse landscape changed drastically with the launch of the Premier Lacrosse League and the migration of nearly 150 Major League Lacrosse players to the upstart league. In addition, the number of MLL teams was shaved from nine to six, as two teams folded and one (Charlotte) went on a hiatus. In the new-look MLL, the Bayhawks took advantage. Led by Lyle Thompson, who would win league MVP and offensive player of the year honors, Chesapeake would finish a league-best 10–6 in the regular season. Despite this, the Bayhawks would essentially have to play as the road team as they eventually made it to the championship game, played at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Denver, where they would face: the Denver Outlaws. In front of an Outlaw-friendly crowd, the Bayhawks stormed out to a 5–0 lead before letting Denver slowly creep back into it. The Outlaws would take their first lead of the game, 9–8, with eight minutes to go. The Bayhawks, though, would persevere with goals from Steele Stanwick and Andrew Kew in the final three minutes. Chesapeake would ultimately win their sixth Steinfeld Cup, and first in six years.

In January 2020, Cottle stepped away as head coach. He was replaced by Tom Mariano, who had previously served as an assistant to Cottle.

==Rivalry==
The Bayhawks&#x27; biggest rival were the New York Lizards. They faced each other in five Steinfeld Cup championships: the first three, in 2005, and in 2010. The Lizards won in 2001 and 2003, the Bayhawks in 2002, 2005, and 2010. Both Long Island and the Baltimore area try to claim bragging rights to be the top &quot;hotbed&quot; of producing lacrosse talent.

<text>The New York Lizards, originally the Long Island Lizards, were a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) team based in Hempstead, New York, located on Long Island. They are original members of the MLL. They lost the league&#x27;s inaugural game on June 7, 2001 to the Baltimore Bayhawks (now Chesapeake Bayhawks), 16–13.

==History==
In the MLL&#x27;s inaugural season in 2001, the Long Island Lizards split their home games between Hofstra Stadium, now James M. Shuart Stadium, and EAB Park (now Bethpage Ballpark). For the 2002 season, they used Hofstra Stadium as their home field. As of 2003, the Lizards played all home contests at Mitchel Athletic Complex, in Uniondale, New York until 2008. The team returned to James M. Shuart Stadium for their home games in 2009. The Lizards have won American Division championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and Major League Lacrosse titles in 2001, 2003 and 2015. The team made the playoffs in 2005 as a wildcard despite a losing record. The team&#x27;s name and logo are based on the Italian wall lizard, a small reptile that was imported to Long Island (which has no native lizards) in the 1960s and which populate areas of the team&#x27;s hometown of Hempstead in Nassau County.
On December 14, 2012, the Lizards changed their name to the New York Lizards.

Prior to the 2015 season, the Lizards made a trade with the Boston Cannons for Paul Rabil. In exchange for Paul Rabil and Mike Stone, the Cannons received Max Seibald, Brian Karalunas and three draft picks. That season, the Lizards won their third Steinfeld Cup and first in 12 years by defeating their instate rival Rochester Rattlers 15–12. The Lizards won the game at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia before a Steinfeld Cup-record 8,674 fans.

Prior to the 2019 season, Rabil and his brother Michael formed the Premier Lacrosse League, which would compete directly with Major League Lacrosse. With the launch of the PLL, 140 players from Major League Lacrosse migrated to the upstart league. In the Lizards&#x27; first season after the pro lacrosse landscape changed vastly, they lost a franchise worst 11 games in 2019, and posted their second-worst winning percentage (.313). After two MLL teams and one went on a hiatus (Charlotte), New York finished last out of six teams that season. After Rob Pannell finished out his contract that season, he too bolted for the PLL. So in 2020, a season shorted and compacted into a week-long, quarantined tournament thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lizards joined the 2006 Chicago Machine as the only two teams in league history to post a winless season; albeit the 2020 Lizards&#x27; 0–5 record was not as bad as the Machine&#x27;s 0–12 season. Additionally, the Lizards led in all five games and only finished with a -8 goal differential (-11 score differential).

==Rivalry==

Chesapeake Bayhawks

The Lizards&#x27; main rival were the Chesapeake Bayhawks. Between them, they hold 8 of the 15 MLL league championships awarded through the 2015 season. The two teams have played in the championship game five times, with Chesapeake winning 3 of those 5.

Boston Cannons

The Lizards have found a new rival in the Boston Cannons after they traded their All Star Mid Fielder Paul Rabil to New York in January 2015. That season the Lizards faced the Cannons in the MLL semi-finals and the game resulted in a dramatic overtime victory for the Lizards(16-15). The tension of that game continued into the 2016 MLL season when the Cannons came to James M. Shuart Stadium, which resulted in another intense over-time victory for the Lizards(13-12).

<doc id="245823" wikidata="Q1258316" url="?curid=245823" title="Dallas Rattlers">
<text>The Dallas Rattlers were a professional men&#x27;s field lacrosse team as a member of Major League Lacrosse (MLL) based in Frisco, Texas starting in 2018. The franchise was a charter member of the MLL, operating as the Rochester Rattlers in Rochester, New York, from 2001 to 2008 and 2011 to 2017.

After the 2008 season, the team was dissolved. The Rattlers&#x27; staff and roster was transferred to the new Toronto Nationals franchise, but the history, colors, and name of the Rattlers franchise remained in Rochester so that they could be used for a future MLL team. After a two-year absence, the Chicago Machine moved to Rochester to play the 2011 season under the Rattlers name.

On November 16, 2017, the franchise announced that it was relocating to Frisco, a northern suburb of Dallas, and would be known as the Dallas Rattlers. The team is owned by Jim Davis, founder and chairman of New Balance.

The league suspended the Rattlers for the 2020 season while retaining the rights to the team branding to possibly return at a later date. Most of the players and team staff were transferred to the expansion Connecticut Hammerheads. 

==Franchise history==
===Rochester Rattlers===
In 2001 and 2002 the team played home games at Frontier Field. They played at Bishop Kearney Field from 2003 to 2005, and moved into the new PAETEC Park in 2006. In April 2015, negotiations between the Rattlers and Sahlen&#x27;s Stadium in Rochester fell through, resulting in the team moving its home field to Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium on the campus of SUNY Brockport. They returned to the city of Rochester for the 2016 season, using Wegmans Stadium at the Aquinas Institute as their home field. In 2017, they announced a return to the city&#x27;s professional soccer stadium, now under new ownership and known as Marina Auto Stadium.
The Rattlers made the playoffs in 2001 and 2005 as a wildcard. They were the National Division champions in 2004. On June 16, 2007, the Rochester Rattlers won a 27–26 (in overtime) game over the Denver Outlaws in the highest scoring game in MLL history at INVESCO Field at Mile High.

In 2008, the Rattlers won their first and only MLL championship by defeating the Philadelphia Barrage 16–15 in overtime in the semifinals and the Denver Outlaws 16–6 in the championship game.

After the 2008 season, the team was dissolved and the rights to the team were sold to a Toronto, Ontario-based group on February 19, 2009. The Rattlers&#x27; staff and roster was transferred to the new Toronto franchise, named the Toronto Nationals; however, the Rattlers&#x27; history, team colors, and name remained in Rochester, thus allowing the Chicago Machine to be re-branded as the Rochester Rattlers in time for the 2011 season.

===Dallas Rattlers===
On November 16, 2017 the league announced that the Rattlers would be relocating to the Dallas market for the 2018 season and become the Dallas Rattlers. It was announced that head coach Tim Soudan would not be joining the team in Texas and instead Bill Warder, a long-time assistant coach for the Rattlers, would be the head coach. Warder and the rest of the Rattlers would play and win their first game as the new Dallas Rattlers on April 21 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in a 15–9 defeat of the Chesapeake Bayhawks.

The Rattlers would finish first place in the league at 11–3, becoming the first team since the 2015 New York Lizards to win a double-digit number of games. They also finished a league-best 6–1 at their new home in Frisco, where they finished second place in the league in attendance. Five of the seven home games in the regular season were decided by one goal.

On August 11, the Rattlers hosted their former in-state rival Lizards in Frisco. The Lizards were the only team to defeat the Rattlers at home in the regular season, just two weeks prior. However, the Rattlers used a balanced attack and a crowd of over 6,000 people to fuel them to a 15–12 victory. The win lifted them to a championship game appearance in their first season in Dallas, and fourth appearance in franchise history.

The championship game was held on August 18 in Charleston, South Carolina at MUSC Health Stadium. The Rattlers would face the third-seeded Denver Outlaws, who defeated the team in the 2014 championship game. After grabbing a 9–6 lead midway through the second quarter, Dallas would suffer a 15-minute scoreless drought while the Outlaws went on a 7–0 run. The Rattlers would never recover and ended up dropping the contest, 16–12. The night before, Bill Warder was named Coach of the Year, John Galloway was named Co-Goalie of the Year, and Matt Dunn was named Defensive Player of the Year.

====2019: New blood====
Like many other teams in the league, when the Premier Lacrosse League was formed, the Rattlers found themselves having to replace a number of star players, including many that had played with each other for several years in Rochester. Key returners that would take upon bigger roles on and off the field in 2019 would include Ryan McNamara, Zack Greer, Donny Moss, Mike Lazore, Jack Curran, and Cody Radziewicz. The Rattlers would also pick up Dallas native Bryce Wasserman in the offseason. Dallas product Christian Carson-Banister would also start the season in goal for the team in his first Major League Lacrosse appearances.

Dallas stumbled out of the gates, starting a league-worst 0-7. However, midseason acquisitions of rookies Sean Sconone (goalie) and Bradley Voigt (attack), as well as veterans Kyle Buchanan and Adam Osika proved wonders. The Rattlers picked up their first win of the season, 11-8 at Broncos Stadium at Mile High against the Denver Outlaws in the last week before the All Star Break. Sconone make his name known with 20 saves. This would start a streak of six straight victories that would result in the Rattlers on the doorstep of a playoff berth. During the streak, the Rattlers would beat every team in the league, win four on the road, and defeat three first-place teams (all on the road).

Despite owning their playoff destiny heading into the last homestand of the season, the Rattlers would lose two one-goal games to New York and Atlanta officially eliminating them from postseason contention. Dallas would finish 7-9 and miss out on the playoffs for just the second time in six years.

<text>The Boston Cannons are a professional field lacrosse team based in Boston, Massachusetts, that competes in the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). The team plays its home games at Harvard Stadium.

The team competed in Major League Lacrosse (MLL) from their inaugural 2001 season to 2020. The team&#x27;s home field was Veterans Memorial Stadium in nearby Quincy. In the MLL, the team won two Steinfeld Cup championship games in 2011 and 2020, the latter being the MLL&#x27;s final championship. The Cannons joined the PLL in 2020 following the MLL–PLL merger and were rebranded as the Cannons Lacrosse Club before later being rebranded as Boston Cannons once again when the PLL assigned home cities after the 2023 season.

==Franchise history==
The Boston Cannons were one of the original six teams of Major League Lacrosse (MLL), and the only team from the pole inaugural 2001 season to stay in the same market, without folding or moving elsewhere. They were the only MLL team identity to continue into the 2021 PLL season following the MLL-PLL merger and in doing so adopted the Cannons Lacrosse identity. The team would once again become the Boston Cannons when the PLL assigned home cities after the 2023 season. MLL was founded by Jake Steinfeld, Dave Morrow, and Tim Robertson. The Cannons founder and president is Matt Dwyer. From their inaugural season of 2001 through 2003, the Cannons played their home games at Cawley Memorial Stadium in Lowell, Massachusetts. In their inaugural 2001 season, the Cannons finished with a record of 3–11 but still qualified for the playoffs finishing in second place in the division. In 2004, they moved to Nickerson Field at Boston University where they played through the 2006 season. In 2007, they moved to Harvard Stadium in Allston, a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, which is less than from Nickerson Field and also within that distance from the Cannons&#x27; main office in Boston. The team qualified for the MLL playoffs 2001–2006, 2009-2011 and 2015. The Cannons won the 2004 and 2005 MLL American Division championships.

===Major League Lacrosse (MLL)===
====2011 championship season====
The Cannons won the Steinfeld Cup for the first time in 2011, defeating the Hamilton Nationals 10–9. Boston went 9–3 in the regular season, their best record since going 10–2 in 2005. After losing to Chesapeake 13–9 in the 2010 semifinal, the Cannons avenged the Bayhawks by defeating them 14–13 in the 2011 semifinal with a goal from Max Quinzani. Boston became the fifth charter franchise to win a championship. By 2011, the Cannons were one of four charter franchises still in the league that started with six teams in 2001. The other three remaining charter franchises (Lizards, Bayhawks, and Rattlers had all previously won at least one Steinfeld Cup (the defunct Barrage had won three). Head coach Bill Daye stepped down a month after winning the Steinfeld Cup, citing he wanted to spend more time with his family. Entering the 2021 season, Daye remains the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in regular-season games coached (72), regular-season games won (43), and playoff games coached (6).

====2013–2018====
The Cannons in 2013 and 2014 finished 5–9 and 6–8. This included a 1–5 start in 2013 leading to Steve Duffy&#x27;s firing on June 10. John Tucker took his place and played .500 for the rest of the season. After the Cannons missed the playoffs for the fourth time in franchise history in 2014, Tucker led the team back to the postseason in 2015 as the 8–6 fourth seed. They played the New York Lizards and lost 16–15 in overtime. The Lizards went on to win the Steinfeld Cup.

John Tucker left the Cannons after the 2015 season to become the first head coach and general manager of the expansion team Atlanta Blaze. On October 8, 2015, Sean Quirk was announced as the sixth head coach in franchise history. In an odd 2016 year in which seven of the league&#x27;s nine teams, including the Cannons, finished with identical 8-6 records, Quirk&#x27;s team was not rewarded with one of the four playoff spots after tie-breaking procedures. On December 20, 2016, it was announced that John Tucker would be returning to the Cannons as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator in 2017. Tucker was fired mid-season by the Blaze after a 3–7 start.

Despite a Week 1 win in 2017, the Cannons season turned around. At 3–6, the Cannons traded away captain Will Manny and Joe LoCascio to the New York Lizards for Dave Lawson and Chris LaPierre on June 27. On July 14, the Cannons announced that neither Lawson nor LaPierre would suit up for the team that season. Dave Lawson informed team officials that he would be retiring from the league while Chris LaPierre decided not to report to the team. The Cannons finished the season on a six-game losing streak. At 3-11, the Cannons posted the worst record in the league and tied their franchise-worst record from 2001, their inaugural season.

====2019–2020: new pro lacrosse landscape and second title====
Following the 2018 season, Paul Rabil launched the Premier Lacrosse League, baiting over 140 MLL players to migrate over. However, the Cannons maintained more of their roster than other teams like the Dallas Rattlers or Rabil&#x27;s New York Lizards. Two months prior to the start of the 2019 season, the league cut the team roster from nine to six when the Ohio Machine and Florida Launch folded and Charlotte Hounds suspended operations for two seasons. Taking this to their advantage, the Cannons posted a 9–7 record in 2019, good enough for the third of four postseason seeds and gave Boston its first playoff berth since 2015. Boston faced the Denver Outlaws in the semifinal, who were also hosting Championship Weekend. The Cannons got off to a hot start and led by as many as six goals, but ultimately fell, 17–15, ending their season.

2019 was the Cannons&#x27; first season in Quincy. During the offseason they announced a move to and $1.5 million renovation of Veterans Memorial Stadium. The Cannons announced two sellouts in their first season in the updated venue.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was shortened to five regular season games in seven days, all to be played in front of no fans at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. The Cannons finished fourth place out of six teams with a 3–2 record, and were the only team to defeat the Denver Outlaws in the regular season. Heading into the postseason, the Cannons were scheduled to play the Outlaws in the semifinal. However, after a player from the Chesapeake Bayhawks experience symptoms of COVID-19 and eventually tested positive, the two other postseason competitors, Chesapeake and Connecticut, withdrew from the tournament. The Cannons&#x27; semifinal game with the Outlaws was pushed back a day and would be played as the championship. Boston defeated Denver for the second time in two days, the latter in 13-10 fashion for the franchise&#x27;s second title, first in nine years. Newcomer attackman Bryce Wasserman, who played for the Dallas Rattlers the season before, was named league MVP for 2020.

==== 2021–2023: Cannons Lacrosse Club ====
On December 16, 2020, in a statement from Major League Lacrosse (MLL), the Boston Cannons officially became the eighth team in the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). It was announced that the team would be dropping &quot;Boston&quot; from their name and become &quot;Cannons Lacrosse Club&quot; to fit league nomenclature, the roster would be set via an expansion draft, and the team would begin play in the PLL in the 2021 season. Small tweaks to the former Boston Cannons branding resulted in a PLL crest and logo reveal on January 12, 2021. One week later, the league announced that Sean Quirk would continue coaching the team.

The Cannons played their first game of the 2021 season on June 4 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, falling to the Redwoods Lacrosse Club, 12–11. They would finish the season 7th in the league, falling in the first round of the playoffs.

====Post-2023 season-present: Boston Cannons====
After the 2023 season the PLL assigned home cities to each of the eight teams. The Cannons were rebranded from Cannons Lacrosse Club to become the Boston Cannons.

The Boston Cannons became the first team to go back to back in winning the Championship Series, defeating the Utah Archers 21-14 with Matt Campbell leading the way on offense with 8 points (7G, 1A). Campbell also won the Golden Stick Award for the most points (23 points) over the course of the series. Colin Kirst also set a record for the most saves during the 6v6 tournament, 72.

In 2001, the first year of the league’s existence, the Pride played its games at Yogi Berra Stadium at Montclair State University.

<text>The War Resisters League (WRL) is the oldest secular pacifist organization in the United States, having been founded in 1923.

==History==
Founded in 1923 by men and women who had opposed World War I, it is a section of the London-based War Resisters&#x27; International. It continues to be one of the leading radical voices in the anti-war movement.

Many of the organization&#x27;s founders had been jailed during World War I for refusing military service. From the Fellowship of Reconciliation many Jews, suffragists, socialists, and anarchists separated to form this more secular organization.

Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in World War II, it did not protest against it; the WRL complied with the Espionage Act, ceased public protests, and did not solicit new members during this period. During World War II, many members were labeled conscientious objectors. In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the civil rights movement and organized protests against nuclear weapons testing and civil defense drills.

In the 1960s, WRL was the first pacifist organization to call for an end to the Vietnam War. WRL also organized the first demonstration against the war with a September 21, 1963 vigil at the U.S. Mission to the UN, followed by an October 9, 1963 picket of Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu speaking at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. WRL was among the primary groups (along with Committee for Nonviolent Action, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Socialist Party, and the Student Peace Union) to organize coordinated nationwide protests against the Vietnam War on December 19, 1964.

The organization&#x27;s opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in feminist and anti-racist causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

WRL published many important periodicals including &quot;The Conscientious Objector&quot; (1939–1946); &quot;WRL News&quot; (1945–1984); the WRL &quot;Peace Calendar&quot; from 1955–2012; &quot;Liberation&quot; magazine (1956–1977); &quot;WIN Peace &amp; Freedom Through Nonviolent Action&quot; (1966–1984); &quot;The Nonviolent Activist&quot; (1984–2006); and the quarterly magazine &quot;WIN through revolutionary nonviolence&quot; (2006–2015), and other materials. See the external links below to find the archived publications.

==The Centennial==

WRL celebrated the centennial of its founding in 2023 by producing a traveling exhibit consisting of eight 7-foot tall freestanding panels on various topics and a 12-foot wide timeline banner. The entire contents of the traveling exhibit is contained within an 84-page full-color book published by the League.

In addition the Judd Foundation hosted celebrations of WRL&#x27;s centennial with a reception on October 18, 2023, followed by &quot;The Art of War Resistance&quot; panel discussion on October 25, 2023, at its SoHo gallery in New York City.

Among other centennial projects, a weekly blog highlighting specific events and publications in WRL&#x27;s history began posting in January 2023 and continues through 2024.

==Current activities==
The War Resisters League actively organized against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and continues to protest what it perceives as U.S. militarism and commitment to endless war, as well as the impact of war at home. Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. 

WRL is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including National Network Opposing the Militarization of Youth and the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee. Starting in 1958, WRL awarded almost annually the War Resisters League Peace Award to a person or organization whose work represents the League&#x27;s radical nonviolent program of action. The Covid-19 pandemic curtailed the peace award ceremonies.

The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the U.S. federal budget actually covers current and past military expenses, listing the total as 37% based on the FY2023 proposed federal budget:
:&quot;The figures are federal funds, &quot;which do not include trust funds&quot; [emphasis added] — such as Social Security — that are raised and spent separately from income taxes...The government practice of combining trust and federal funds began during the Vietnam War, thus making the human needs portion of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller. &quot;

Using the larger total spending that includes trust funds, official government figures produce smaller percentages for military spending: 
:&quot;[Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller pointed] out that the 2004 military budget would represent 16.6 percent of &quot;all federal spending&quot; [including trust funds; emphasis added], compared with 27.3 percent in the late 1980s.&quot;

<doc id="245835" wikidata="Q3868600" url="?curid=245835" title="Music of Tanzania">
<text>As it is in other countries, the music in Tanzania is constantly undergoing changes, and varies by location, people, settings and occasion. The five music genres in Tanzania, as defined by BASATA are, ngoma, dansi, kwaya, and taarab, with bongo flava being added in 2001. Singeli has since the mid-2000s been an unofficial music of &quot;uswahilini for&quot; unplanned communities in Dar es Salaam, and is the newest mainstream genre since 2020.

Ngoma &quot;(Bantu, meaning dance, drum and event)&quot; is a traditional dance music that has been the most widespread music in Tanzania. Dansi is urban jazz or band music. Taarab is sung Kiswahili poetry accompanied by a band, typically string, in which audience is often, but not always, encouraged to dance and clap. Kwaya is choir music originally limited to church during colonization, but now an secular part of education, social, and political events.

Bongo flava is Tanzanian pop music originated in the early 2000s from &quot;muziki wa kizazi kipya&quot;, meaning &quot;Music of the new generation&quot;, which originated in the late 1980s. Kizazi kipya&#x27;s dominant influences were reggae, RnB, and hip hop, where as the later bongo flava&#x27;s dominant influences are taarab and dansi. Three recent influence on bongo flava are Afropop in the 2010s, as well as bongopiano and singeli. Singeli is a ngoma music and dance whereby a MC performs over fast tempo taarab music, often at between 200–300 beats per minute (BPM) while females dance. Male and female MCs are near equally common, however styles between MC gender typically differ significantly. Male MCs usually perform in fast paced rap, while female MCs usually perform kwaya.

From independence until 1993, all recording and distribution of music was strictly managed by BASATA, primarily through Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam (RTD). Only the 4 Tanzanian genres were permitted to be recorded or broadcast, which at the time was ngoma, taarab, kwaya and dansi. The Broadcasting Services Act of 1993 allowed private broadcast networks and recording studios. In the few years prior to the 1993 Act hip hop had been established in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mwanza. It was transitioning from English performances to hip hop originated from uzunguni, rich areas like Oysterbay and Masaki with the international schools, to Kiswahili performances of kizazi kipya, originating in uswahilini Following the opening of the radio waves, bongo flava spread throughout the country, and the rest of the Great Lakes.

== Ngoma (dance) ==

Ngoma &quot;(Bantu, meaning dance, drum, and celebration)&quot; is an East and Southern African style of music, dance, and instruments, however in Tanzania, and other Swahili areas, also refers to events such as celebrations, rituals, or significant event in life such as giving birth or the passing of a loved one. The traditional forms of ngoma dancing prominently feature movements of the hips. It also features a large variety of instruments used, but most notable is the use of drums, specifically those that take the name from the style, ngoma drums. In some other cases, there may only be singing and dancing with no instruments used, such as the Maasai dances of Ambrokoi or the Wangoni dance of Ligihu. These are usually dances of jumping and stomping, providing the rhythms, and lots of singing.

Historically ngoma has been primarily &#x27;traditional&#x27; as it passed from generation to generation however was prohibited in colonial times for being &#x27;wicked&#x27; and &#x27;primitive&#x27;. In more recent times, particularly after 1985, this has been changing with ngoma becoming both more modern, and fluid or creative. Whether for societal reasons or new economic realities, ngoma is being taught by elders to youth less and less today. Nevertheless, ngoma is still popular. More often youth are taking what they can learn about various dances from different sources, including varieties of people, tribes, and places, as well as other styles of music such as bongo flava to combine all of these inspirations into new forms of dance. This has been a source of generational resentment between elders and youths, with elders upset at the lack of authenticity of the youths&#x27; ngoma, and the youths upset at never being taught authentic ngoma as the elders were. While there has been this loss of traditional nature to ngoma over the past 40 years, it has evolved into its modern genre, often including the use of modern instruments. Many of the traditional instruments of ngoma are no longer possible due to the outlawing of hunting preventing the access to materials necessary for many instruments. As a result, modern instruments such as guitars are used, as well as electronic equipment such as microphones, amplifiers, and keyboards.

One example of the new styles being created is the UMATI troupe from Iringa town. They created their own dance using a combination of dances Lingunjumu and Sindimba from Southern Tanzania, Mdundiko from the coast, and Akasimbo from Kagera while incorporating bongo flava moves. Much in the same way bongo flava is designed to appeal to a broad audience, both genders, for economic and commercial reasons, modern ngoma often does the same. UMATI&#x27;s dance incorporates dances from a broad geographic range, while also incorporating traditional ngoma inspirations that can appeal to the elders, and bongo flava inspirations that can appeal to the youth.

==Taarab (poetry) ==


Taarab is a music genre popular in Tanzania and Kenya. It is stage-performed music that consists of sung Kiswahili poetry, usually about love, accompanied by a band typically heavy on string instruments. Today the audience participates in dancing, cheering or clapping, occasionally singing, and rewarding the performers when appropriate. taarab music first arose on Zanzibar island around 1830s as a Swahili music with some influence by the musical traditions of the Mainland Great Lakes, North Africa (especially Egyptian instruments), the Arabia, and the Indian subcontinent. Taarab spread to the mainland and neighboring countries in the 1920s and rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre&#x27;s first star, Siti binti Saad. Prior to the rise of muziki wa dansi (jazz), taarab was usually listed to by a sitting and attentive audience. Following the World Wars, and even more so after independence, the audience participates by dancing, clapping, and singing. Lyrically, leading into and during the independence movements of the 1950s, taarab began to address politics.

== Kwaya (choir) ==
Kwaya is a choir and a large part of Tanzanian life. It is practiced in school, church and even still events such as political rallies. Kwaya was originally a purely European form of music brought to Tanganyika by the Europeans and practiced in churches to the accompaniment of only European instruments, usually in European language. Gregory Barz described colonial use of kwaya in Tanzania as &quot;‘‘one of the most highly developed tools used in the colonization and domination of land and people, body and spirit.’’&quot; 

Following independence in 1961, the TANU government understood the usefulness of kwaya for secular purposes to create a national identity, and promote education and ujamaa. One of the first actions TANU undertook for the new nation was to create schools to educate the population, which at that time had less 5% literacy due to absence of schools. TANU created an education system, building schools in every village and neighborhood, and chose to make kwaya an instrumental aspect of education, as it still is today. This proved hugely successful, with Tanzania enjoying high literacy reaching 80% literacy in 18 years after independence. Alongside the kwaya troupes, TANU created and promoted &quot;ngonjera&quot;, a form of poetry as a dialog, debate, and praise usually for the TANU party. After 1985 and onto today, kwaya is still widespread, particularly in schools, and church, and as a powerful influence in other forms of music, but the use of both kwaya and ngonjera as a political tool is significantly diminished today, rarely used by CCM. The central role kwaya continues to play in early and religious life has helped make it highly influential music in Tanzania. Most singers learn how to sing in choirs at a young age, and kwaya is frequently featured in other forms of music, especially the very popular modern bongo flava.

== Dansi (jazz / band) ==
Dansi is a form of jazz or band music played for a dancing audience. With the great influence of Belgian Congo, and following the return of soldiers such as the King&#x27;s African Rifles, new musical ideas of styles, marches, and instruments grew in popularity. With these new ideas dancing clubs started opening and becoming greatly popular in cities such as Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Ujiji, Morogoro, Tabora and many others. Following independence, the single-party government of TANU (later CCM) placed music as a central aspect of Tanzanian nationalistic identity, as laid out by President Nyerere. Mwalimu Nyerere spoke of focusing on African traditions rather than western traditions, and contrasted ngoma against muziki wa dansi, in his inauguration speech in on 1962.

In practice, however, both artist, the public, and his TANU government embraced, used, combined, and created from both traditional dance and modern jazz to establish and promote nationalism and Ujamaa &quot;(African Socialism)&quot; for the new nation. While there are always differences from tribe to tribe, to club to club, the nature of dance music in Tanzania is rarely limited and usually inspired by a large variety of sources. An example of this is the most famous Tanzania musician, Remmy Ongala when he would perform in Masai dress.

The first popular music craze in Tanzania was in the early 1930s when Cuban Rumba was widespread. Young Tanzanians organized themselves into dance clubs and bands, like the Dar es Salaam Jazz Band, which was founded in 1932. Local bands at the time used brass and percussion instruments, later adding strings. Bands like Morogoro Jazz and Tabora Jazz were formed (despite the name, these bands did not play American style jazz). Competitions were commonplace, a legacy of native ngoma societies and colonial beni brass bands.

Tanzania was influenced heavily after the 1960s by the influence of African and Latin music. Tanzanian soldiers brought back with them the music of these cultures, as well as Cuban and European music when returning from World War II. These musical influences fused and brought together the Tanzanian people. Eventually, the country and its people created their own style of music. This style, called &quot;Swahili Jazz&quot; is a mix of beats and styles of Cuban, European, Latin, and African music. Swahili jazz gave Tanzania a sense of independence and togetherness as a country.

Independence came in 1961, however, and three years later the state patronage system was set up, and most of the previous bands fell apart. Musicians were paid regular fees, plus a percentage of the gate income, and worked for a department of the government. The first such band is the Nuta Jazz Band, which worked for the National Union of Tanzania.

The 1970s saw the popularization a laid-back sound popularized by Orchestre Safari Sound and Orchestre Maquis Original. These groups adopted the motto &quot;Kamanyola bila jasho&quot; (&quot;dance Kamanyola without sweating&quot;). Marquis hailed from Lubumbashi in southeastern Zaire, moving to Dar es Salaam in the early 70s. This was a common move at the time, bringing elements of soukous from the Congo Basin. Kasalo Kyanga composed the 1985 hit &quot;Karubandika&quot;, which was a popular dance song.

Popular bands in the 60s, 70s, and 80s included Vijana Jazz, who were the first to add electronic instruments to dansi (in 1987), and DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra, led by Michael Enoch. Rivalries between the bands sometimes led to chaos in the scene, as when Hugo Kisima lured musicians from Mlimani Park and disbanded the wildly popular Orchestra Safari Sound in 1985, forming the International Orchestra Safari Sound. International Orchestra Safari Sound was briefly popular, but the Orchestra Safari Sound was revitalized by Nguza Viking (formerly of maquis), who became a bandleader in 1991; this new group lasted only a year.

The most recent permutation of Tanzanian dance music is mchiriku. Bands like Gari Kubwa, Tokyo Ngma, and Atomic Advantage are among the pioneers of this style, which uses four drums and a keyboard for a sparse sound. Loudness is very important to the style, which is usually blared from outdated speakers; the resulting feedback is part of the music. The origin of the style is Zaramo wedding music.

Saida Karoli is a famous traditionalist Tanzanian female singer and performer, who sings in Haya. Karoli&#x27;s music is described as natural with mellow vocals and hypnotically rhythmicism. Her songs &quot;Ndombolo Ya Solo&quot; or &quot;Maria Salome&quot; were huge hits in Tanzania and the countries around; she was nominated at the 2005 and 2006 Tanzania Music Awards in the Best Folk Album category and for the Best Female Vocalist category.

=== Mtindo ===

A mtindo (pl. &quot;mitindo&quot;) is simply a rhythm, dance style, and fashion identified with a particular band and refers to their &quot;ngoma&quot;, often from a particular locality or people. For example, &quot;Sikinde&quot; is associated with Mlimani Park Orchestra, &quot;Msondo&quot; with the Juwata Jazz Band, &quot;Ndekule&quot; with the Orchestra Safari Sound, and &quot;Bongo&quot; is associated with Remmy Ongala and his Orchestra Super Matimila. Some bands maintain the same &quot;mtindo&quot; throughout their career, while others change with new personnel or popular preference.

== Bongo Flava (pop) ==

Bongo Flava is one of the newer Tanzanian genres, developed in the 1990s, and is a fusion genre. It is a continuation of &quot;muziki wa kizazi kipya&quot;, meaning &quot;Music of the new generation&quot; of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s. At its inception, bongo flava was more heavily influenced by US hip-hop and reggae, fused with Tanzanian music styles.

The current trend among Tanzanian music consumers has started changing from international popular music towards favoring products from their local artists who sing in Kiswahili. Popular artists include Kontawa, Barakah The Prince, Frida Amani, Maua Sama, Mavokali ,Vanessa Mdee (Vee Money), Bill Nass, Diamond Platnumz, Harmonize, Jux, Alikiba, Shetta, Ben Pol, Lava Lava, Dully Sykes, Rich Mavoko, Rayvanny, Nandy. Some of the best known producers include Tudd Thomas, Mesen Selekta, Nahreel, S2Kizzy. and Yogobeats

One of the key aspects of bongo flava that has helped its success is its ability to use such a wide variety of all music types even within the same song, making it appealing to both males and females, a much larger and all-encompassing audience. In a survey conducted in Morogoro asking Tanzanians what their favorite type of music to listen to, 3/4ths of females and 4/5th of males responded bongo flava. However, after bongo flava the difference in listening habits of males and females diverged enormously, with females preferring kwaya and males preferring foreign hip hop.

=== Etymology ===

The name &quot;Bongo&quot; of Bongo Flava comes from Kiswahili usually meaning &quot;brains, intelligence, cleverness&quot; but can also mean &quot;mentally deranged&quot;. Bongo is the augmentative form of &quot;Ubongo&quot;, Kiswahili for Brainland. Flava is Kiswahili for &quot;Flavour&quot;. Ubongo is a term originally used, and in Tanzania still used, for the city of Dar es Salaam. Outside Tanzania, Ubongo is often referring to Tanzania. Ubongo as a term originated from a speech by President Nyerere in the late &#x27;70s during a very difficult time following both the global fuel shocks of the &#x27;70s and the Kagera war against Uganda. Mwalimu Nyerere spoke that only a nation using brains (using Kiswahili &quot;Ubongo&quot; for Brainland) could, and would, overcome the difficult challenges Tanzania was facing. Unfortunately, things became even worse for Tanzania, and by the early 1980s Dar es Salaam was calling itself mostly by the name &quot;Jua Kali&quot; (hot sun/&quot;world is spinning/dizzy&quot;) but also &quot;Ubongo&quot;. The term Ubongo was being used as a clever way to say both, survival in Dar es Salaam required brains and inelegance, but was also full of mentally deranged people.

In 1981 musician Remmy Ongala founded a band called Matimila. Each band has a unique &quot;mtindo&quot; (style/fashion) and Remmy Ongala&#x27;s band Matimila named their mtindo &quot;Bongo&quot;. Remmy Ongala would become the most famous musician ever for Tanzania, reaching global fame working with English singer Peter Gabriel.

=== Kizazi Kipya ===

In 1991, Tanzania hosted a hip hop competition called &quot;Yo Rap Bonanza.&quot; While most rappers were performing American songs word for word; Saleh Ajabry, a Tanzanian, wrote his own Swahili lyrics to a song based on Vanilla Ice’s &quot;Ice Ice Baby,&quot; and won the competition. Dar es Salaam&#x27;s Kwanza Unit is the first Tanzanian hip hop crew, but technical limitations hindered commercial success. Mr. II and Juma Nature are the most famous Tanzanian rappers; Mr II&#x27;s (then known as 2-Proud) &quot;Ni Mimi&quot; (1995) is the first major hit for the field. Groups like X Plastaz have moved away from American-style hip hop and incorporated Maasai vocal styles and other Tanzanian music styles. Tanzanian hip hop is often called &quot;Bongo Flava&quot;.

Tanzanian urban youth absorbed global hip hop music and produced their own varieties. With the increased medialization of Tanzania in the 1990s, Tanzanian urban youth have had more access to hip hop music, and the incorporation of global culture has become more prevalent and visible in urban Tanzania, not only in the music, but also in fashion, food, dance, and sports. Hip hop has essentially provided Tanzanian urban youth and young adults with a means of expressing themselves and forming an identity, such as the conceptual identity of &quot;msafiri&quot; (the traveler), a classic subject borrowed from Swahili lore, and a recurrent theme in Dar hip hop. While Tanzania hip hop is influenced by American hip hop it is also distinctly localized. Whereas American hip hop is the product of black urban youth and heavily influenced by race, Tanzania bongo flava took root in the slightly better off part of the city with those that more access to the Western world. Furthermore, Tanzania hip hop artist saw themselves as distinct from American artists in that they focus more on economic issues and less on violence&quot;&quot; Rapper Sam Stigilydaa put it poignantly when he said, &quot;American rappers talk about crazy things-drinking, drugs, violence against women, American blacks killing blacks. I hope African doesn&#x27;t turn crazy&quot;

Prior to 2002 Kizazi Kipya, and its fans, were seen by most, particularly elders, as kihuni &quot;(culture of hooligans, trouble makers, drugs)&quot;. With the release of &#x27;Machozi, Jasho na Damu&#x27; &quot;(Blood, Sweat and Tears)&quot; in 2002 by Professor Jay, bongo flava reached widespread acceptance and appeal. Professor Jay&#x27;s landmark album contained messages that resonated, and connected, to and with both the youth and elders of society. Songs such as &quot;Ndio Mzee&quot;&quot;(Yes Elder)&quot; and &quot;Siyo Mzee&quot;&quot;(No Elder)&quot; were political and funny while respectful and meaningful. &#x27;Ndio Mzee&#x27; would go on to win best single in 2002. Along with the album as a whole it remains one of the most important and transitional moments in bongo flava&#x27;s acceptance and spread.

=== Hip hop ===
Hip hop in Tanzania today is primarily a form of bongo flava. While Dar es Salaam is the center of Tanzanian and East African bongo flava and has a huge hip hop presence of its own, Arusha is seen as the center of hip hop in Tanzania and has a very large and important presence on hip hop for East Africa as a whole. As a greatly important international city home to many United Nations, African Union, East Africa Community, and many international NGO headquarters, the large international presence, along with many progressive organizations and dominant studios that have headed the city since 2000 like Grandmaster Records, has helped Arusha and its music scene has flourished with its festivals, community centers, and youth organizations. Okoa Mtaa Foundation being a most important and influential such youth organization, with its hip hop festivals. Okoa Mtaa is heavily influenced by the United African Alliance Community Center based in Arusha and founded by former Black Panthers. Other important hip hop collectives today are Ujamaa Hip Hop and Tamaduni Muzik.

Because of the massive hip hop artist and fan base in Northern Tanzania&#x27;s Arusha city, today it is termed as East Africa&#x27;s hip hop capital. Artists such as Chaba, Mo Plus, Fido Vato, Spark Dog Malik, JCB, Watengwa, Chindo aka Umbwax, Donii, Wadudu wa dampo, Jambo Squad, Nako-to-nako, Weusi, Nahreel and many others who are heading Tanzania&#x27;s hip-hop music are from this city. There are other hip hop artists and crew like tamaduni music, kikosi kazi and artist like fid q, nikki mbishi, p the mc, dizasta vina, zaiid, the one incredible, mex cortez, cygon, mansu lii, nash mc, 6 o&#x27;clock, ghetto ambasador, songa, wakazi, afande sele, stamina, roma, jay moh, professor, chid benz as well as the upcoming artists like cado kitengo, man side, toxic fuvu, they conserve hip hop elements and originality, they are calling themselves &quot;baba wa rap&quot;, the fathers of rap&quot;, they are from dar es salaam, they have to freestyle session event like kilingeni msasani club.

== Singeli ==

Singeli is a music genre that originated in Kinondoni in north-west Dar es Salaam in the mid 2000s, and has since the late 2010s spread throughout Tanzania, and since 2020 the surrounding Great Lakes. Singeli is a &quot;ngoma&quot; music and dance where a MC performs over fast tempo &quot;taarab&quot; music, often at between 200-300 beats per minute (BPM) while females dance. Male and female MCs are near equally common, however gender-related styles between MC differ significantly. Male MCs usually perform in fast paced rap, while female MCs usually perform &quot;kwaya&quot;.

In the early 2000s &quot;vigodoro&quot;, meaning all night parties, began being organized by women for their female family and friends in various &quot;uswahilini&quot;, particularly Manzese and Tandale. The parties involved playing cassette tapes of &quot;taarab&quot; music that other women would dance to. As &quot;vigodoro&quot; parties grew in popularity, MCs have been invited to come and perform over the cassettes. Msaga Sumu was one such MC and is considered one of the early founders of Singeli.

== Other music ==

=== National anthem ===

The Tanzanian national anthem is &quot;Mungu Ibariki Africa&quot; (God Bless Africa), composed by South African composer Enoch Sontonga in 1897. The tune is the ANC&#x27;s official song and later became the national anthem of South Africa. The melody is also the national anthem of Zambia. In Tanzania, Swahili lyrics were written for this anthem. - Another patriotic song, going back to colonial times, is Tanzania, Tanzania.

The renowned Tanzanian music artist Mbaraka Mwinshehe (June 27, 1944 - January 12, 1979) was the most popular and original musician of Tanzania, culminating in contributions to the &quot;African rumba&quot; movement arguably originated in the Congo from decades prior.

Also, there was a greater influx of musicians from the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), who entered into Tanzania as refugees to then earn a living and relocate there. But in recent decades, mainly from the mid-1990s, a new generation of musicians has emerged to create popular music that is predominantly Tanzanian in form. Bands like Twanga Pepeta (African Stars Band), among others, created new and original Tanzanian sounds.

=== Reggae and dancehall ===

Jah Kimbuteh is the first major reggae star in Tanzania, beginning his career with Roots and Culture in 1985. Newer artists in the Tanzanian reggae genre include the Jam Brothers and Ras Innocent Nyanyagwa.

At present, Ras Nas is considered one of the best-known reggae musicians from Tanzania. Ras Nas combines reggae, afro, and dub poetry. Many musicians work in bands that play at a hotel, usually led by a keyboard and including a rock-based sound.

=== Rock ===

One of the most internationally famous rock musician, Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara into the Indian Parsi community of Stone Town, Zanzibar, moved to England after the Zanzibar Revolution over through British, and later Arab, colonial rule. He rose to worldwide fame as the lead singer, and a songwriter and instrumentalist, of the rock music group Queen. Neither Mr. Mercury, or the band Queen, ever performed in Tanzania. Their only African performance being the very controversial 1983 Works Tour where Queen disregarded UN Sanctions and performed in Apartheid South Africa to widespread condemnation by audiences and artists worldwide. The Mercury House, a former home of the Bulsara family, opened as a souvenir store in Stone Town, Zanzibar, in 2002. It opened as a museum to Freddie Mercury on 24 November 2019.

== Distribution and access to music ==
The mushrooming of FM music stations and reasonable production studios has been a major boost to the music industry in Tanzania. Contemporary artists like Diamond Platnumz, Harmonize, Juma Nature, Nandy, Rayvanny, Ali Kiba, Lady Jaydee, Mr. Nice, Elja Eks, Mr. II, Cool James, Dully Sykes, Professor Jay and many others command a huge audience of followers in the country and neighbouring countries.

More information about Tanzanian music and events can be found on the various web portals that have sprung up recently. Tanzania has an enormously high growth rate for internet technologies, estimated at up to 500% per year. Because costs for computers are still quite high, many users share connections at internet cafes or at work.naomba.com business directory, tanzaniadirectory.info Movie, and Sports information, and Arusha locality information all are part of an increasing number of websites dedicated to the region. Digital Tanzania music downloads are mostly done by free download websites and music platforms like iTunes, Google Music, etc.

<text>Immorality Act was the title of two acts of the Parliament of South Africa which prohibited, amongst other things, sexual relations between white people and people of other races. The first Immorality Act, of 1927, prohibited sex outside of marriage between whites and blacks, until amended in 1950 to prohibit sex between whites and all non-whites. The second Immorality Act, of 1957, continued this prohibition and also dealt with many other sex offences. The ban on interracial sex was lifted in 1985, but certain sections of the 1957 act dealing with prostitution remain in force as the &quot;Sexual Offences Act, 1957&quot;.

Between 1950 and the repeal of the law in 1985, at least 19,000 people were fully prosecuted for violating the law, whereas thousands more were arrested without a trial.

==The 1927 act==

The Immorality Act, 1927 (Act No. 5 of 1927) prohibited sexual intercourse outside of marriage between &quot;Europeans&quot; (white people) and &quot;natives&quot; (black people). The penalty was up to five years&#x27; imprisonment for the man and four years&#x27; imprisonment for the woman. A person&#x27;s colour during trial was dictated by their &#x27;race&#x27;, a term which described a person&#x27;s appearance, mannerisms, and assumed descent/ethnicity (similar to later &#x27;colour classifications&#x27; recognised during the Apartheid era of South African history, where races were decided upon by government officials, not pre-determined by the true ethnicity of the accused). The act also prohibited &quot;procuring&quot; women for interracial intercourse, and contained a proposal that described a punishment of up to six years of imprisonment specifically for coloured women who were thought to be provoking white males to have intercourse with them.

The Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 (Act No. 21 of 1950) amended the 1927 act to forbid unmarried sexual intercourse between &quot;Europeans&quot; and anyone not &quot;European&quot;. The prohibition was therefore extended to intercourse between white people and coloured or Asian people. Interracial marriages had been banned in 1949 by the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. Later legislation closely related to the Immorality Act also banned the marriage of interracial couples outside of South Africa, viewing foreign marriages as invalid and illegal.

==The 1957 act==

The Immorality Act, 1957 (Act No. 23 of 1957; subsequently renamed the Sexual Offences Act, 1957) repealed the 1927 and 1950 acts and replaced them with a clause prohibiting sexual intercourse or &quot;immoral or indecent acts&quot; between white people and anyone not white. It increased the penalty to up to seven years&#x27; imprisonment for both partners. The 1957 act also prohibited brothel-keeping, procuring, and living off the proceeds of prostitution; and it prohibited sexual intercourse with people under the age of sixteen.

The Immorality Amendment Act, 1969 (Act No. 57 of 1969) amended the 1957 act to introduce or expand a number of offences. It prohibited the manufacturing or sale of any &quot;article intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act&quot; (i.e. sex toys). Despite the fact that sex between men was already prohibited under the common law crime of sodomy, the 1969 act made it a statutory crime for a man to have sex with another male under the age of nineteen. It also introduced section 20A, the infamous &quot;three men at a party&quot; clause, which prohibited any sexual activity between men at a party, where &quot;party&quot; was defined as any occasion where more than two people were present.

The Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985 (Act No. 72 of 1985) repealed the provisions of the 1957 act that prohibited interracial sex, and repealed the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. This came as part of the repeal of many petty apartheid laws under the government of P. W. Botha. This act specifically deleted the definitions of &quot;coloured&quot; and &quot;white&quot; within the act, and repealed Section 16 of the 1957 act which barred interracial, extramarital sex.

The Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 (Act No. 2 of 1988) renamed the Immorality Act, 1957 to the Sexual Offences Act, 1957. It criminalised, for the first time, a woman having sex with a person under the age of consent, for that purpose setting the age of consent at 16 for a boy and 19 for a girl. It also made it a crime to be a prostitute, where previously only certain acts related to prostitution (brothel-keeping, procuring, etc.) had been illegal. The legislation also noted that either gender could now be convicted of sexual offences.

==Repeal==
The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 repealed most of the remaining provisions of the 1957 act. The only provisions still in force are those related to prostitution.

The men-at-a-party offence (section 20A) was invalidated in 1998 by the Constitutional Court in the case of &quot;National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice&quot;. The increased age of consent of nineteen for same-sex sexual activity (as opposed to sixteen for opposite-sex sexual activity) was invalidated in 2008 in the case of &quot;Geldenhuys v National Director of Public Prosecutions&quot;, although by that time the discriminatory provisions had been repealed by the 2007 amendment act.

<text>Fantagraphics (previously Fantagraphics Books) is an American publisher of alternative comics, classic comic strip anthologies, manga, magazines, graphic novels, and (formerly) the erotic Eros Comix imprint. They have managed several awards for achievement in comic books.

==History==

=== Founding ===

Fantagraphics was founded in 1976 by Gary Groth and Michael Catron in College Park, Maryland. The company took over an adzine named &quot;The Nostalgia Journal&quot;, which it renamed &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;.

As comics journalist (and former Fantagraphics employee) Michael Dean writes, &quot;the publisher has alternated between flourishing and nearly perishing over the years.&quot; Kim Thompson joined the company in 1977, using his inheritance to keep the company afloat. (He soon became a co-owner.)

The company moved from Washington, D.C., to Stamford, Connecticut, to Los Angeles over its early years, before settling in Seattle in 1989.

Beginning in 1981 Fantagraphics (under its Redbeard Inc. imprint) published &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, a magazine which examined comics from a hobbyist&#x27;s point of view, as another income stream to supplement &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; ran for 204 issues (plus a number of specials and annuals), folding with its July 1992 issue.

=== Comics publisher ===
Beginning in 1979, Fantagraphics began publishing comics, starting with Jay Disbrow&#x27;s &quot;The Flames of Gyro&quot;. They gained wider recognition in 1982 by publishing the Hernandez brothers&#x27; &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;, and moved on to such critically acclaimed and award-winning series as &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;, &quot;Eightball&quot;, and &quot;Hate&quot;.

The company moved operations to Greater Los Angeles in 1984.

Catron acted as Fantagraphics&#x27; co-publisher until 1985 (also handling advertising and circulation for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; from 1982 to 1985), when he left the company.

=== The Kirby Award and the Harvey Award ===
From 1985 to 1987, Fantagraphics coordinated and presented (through their magazine &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;) The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals. The Kirby Award was managed by Dave Olbrich, a Fantagraphics employee (and later publisher of Malibu Comics). In 1987, a dispute arose when Olbrich and Fantagraphics each claimed ownership of the awards. A compromise was reached, and, starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued and two new awards were created: the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich; and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award, named for cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman.

=== Relocation to Seattle ===
In 1989, Fantagraphics relocated from Los Angeles to its current location in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

In 1990, the publisher introduced Eros Comix, a lucrative line of erotic comics that provided a replacement revenue stream for &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; and which helped the company again avoid bankruptcy.

Longtime employee Eric Reynolds joined Fantagraphics in 1993, first as news editor for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; from 1993, before moving to marketing and promotion in 1996. Groth and Thompson acknowledged Reynolds was key to the company&#x27;s rise to profitability.

Tom Spurgeon, later known as the publisher of &quot;The Comics Reporter&quot;, was editor of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; from 1994 to 1999.

=== Financial ups and downs ===
In 1998, Fantagraphics was forced into a round of layoffs; and in 2003 the company almost went out of business, losing over $60,000 in the wake of the 2002 bankruptcy of debtor and book trade distributor Seven Hills Distribution. One employee quit during the subsequent downsizing while denouncing Fantagraphics&#x27; &quot;disorganization and poor management.&quot; Fantagraphics was saved by a restructuring and a successful appeal to comic book fandom that resulted in a huge number of orders. After restructuring, the company has had greater success with such hardcover collections as &quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot;, distributed by W. W. Norton &amp; Company.

In 2009, Fantagraphics ceased publishing the print edition of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, shifting from an eight-times a year publishing schedule to a larger, more elaborate, semi-annual format supported by a new website.

=== European line ===
Starting in 2005, Fantagraphics began a European graphic novel line, starting with the co-publication of the Ignatz Series, edited and produced by the Italian artist Igort. The publisher announced a deal with Jacques Tardi in March 2009 that would see co-publisher Thompson translate a large number of his books.

=== New challenges ===
In 2006, Fantagraphics opened its own retail store, Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp; Gallery, in Seattle&#x27;s Georgetown neighborhood.

In 2009 Jacq Cohen started as the publicist for Fantagraphics.

Co-publisher Kim Thompson left Fantagraphics due to illness in March 2013, and died of lung cancer a few months later. His absence left the company without a number of titles it had been counting on for the summer and fall of 2013; and, in November, Fantagraphics started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $150,000, which it surpassed in four days.

In August 2020 the company rebranded, from &quot;Fantagraphics Books&quot; to just &quot;Fantagraphics&quot;. At the same time it introduced a more compact logo featuring a stylized ink pen nib and a torch.

==Imprints==

===Ignatz Series===
The Ignatz Series is an international comic imprint. It is published by Fantagraphics (U.S.), Avant Verlag (Germany), Vertige Graphic (France), Oog &amp; Blik (Holland), Coconino Press (Italy), and Sinsentido (Spain). It is named for Ignatz Mouse, a character in the comic strip &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;.

The books in the Ignatz Series are designed midway between standard North American comic book pamphlet-size and graphic novel-size. Each title is 32 pages, two-color, saddle stitched, 8″ × 11″, with jacket, priced at $7.95.

The Ignatz collection is edited and produced by Italian artist Igort. Fantagraphics editor Kim Thompson frequently provided translations.

===Eros Comix===
Eros Comix was an adult-oriented imprint of Fantagraphics, established in 1990 to publish pornographic comic books like Gilbert Hernandez&#x27; &quot;Birdland&quot; and reprints of work by Wally Wood and Frank Thorne. Eventually, Eros added to its catalogue dozens of comics titles, over 40 collected editions, anime videos, DVDs, and books of erotic art and photography. The 2006 Eros Comix print catalog sold over 470 items, including adult comic books and humorous cheesecake-style comics often featuring pin-up girls like Bettie Page. The Eros Comix imprint was popular enough that it is credited with making Fantagraphics financially solvent.

Notable Eros titles include Bill Willingham&#x27;s &quot;Ironwood&quot;, SS Crompton&#x27;s &quot;Demi the Demoness&quot;, Howard Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;Black Kiss&quot;, &quot;Domino Lady&quot;; and the Italian series &quot;Djustine&quot;, &quot;Ramba&quot;, and &quot;Adult Frankenstein&quot;.

Writer-artist Tom Sutton contributed work to Eros titles under the pseudonym &quot;Dementia&quot;. Other contributors to Eros titles included Eric Stanton, Mary Fleener, Mikael Oskarsson, Bill Pearson, Malachy Coney, Richard Bassford, Gary Dumm, Frank Stack, Bob Fingerman, Molly Kiely, Yanick Paquette, Robert Peters, John Workman, Colleen Coover, Marc Andreyko, Raulo Cáceres, Larry Fuller, Dennis Eichhorn, Dennis Cramer/Justine Mara Andersen, Jon Macy, John Blackburn, and Greg Budgett.

Eros&#x27; MangErotica line featured translated hentai manga by the likes of Isutoshi, Oh! great, Toshiki Yui, Teruo Kakuta, and Benkyo Tamaoki; and titles like &quot;Bondage Fairies&quot;, &quot;Hatsuinu&quot;, &quot;Hot Tails&quot;, &quot;A Strange Kind of Woman&quot;, &quot;Slut Girl&quot;, and &quot;Super Taboo&quot;.

In the beginning, there was some controversy over Eros titles featuring back cover ads with phone sex numbers. In 1994, Eros editor Tom Verre was replaced by Jeremy Pinkham.

By the late 1990s, the imprint was no longer profitable, and the publication of new material diminished rapidly. The Eros Comix website was no longer being maintained by 2017; its titles no longer appear on the Fantagraphics website under that label.

<text>A fume hood (sometimes called a fume cupboard or fume closet) is a type of local exhaust ventilation device that is designed to prevent users from being exposed to hazardous fumes, vapors, and dusts. The device is an enclosure with a movable sash window on one side that traps and exhausts gases and particulates either out of the area (through a duct) or back into the room (through air filtration), and is most frequently used in laboratory settings. 

The first fume hoods, constructed from wood and glass, were developed in the early 1900s as a measure to protect individuals from harmful gaseous reaction by-products. Later developments in the 1970s and 80s allowed for the construction of more efficient devices out of epoxy powder-coated steel and flame-retardant plastic laminates. Contemporary fume hoods are built to various standards to meet the needs of different laboratory practices. They may be built to different sizes, with some demonstration models small enough to be moved between locations on an island and bigger &quot;walk-in&quot; designs that can enclose large equipment. They may also be constructed to allow for the safe handling and ventilation of perchloric acid and radionuclides and may be equipped with scrubber systems. Fume hoods of all types require regular maintenance to ensure the safety of users.

Most fume hoods are ducted and vent air out of the room they are built in, which constantly removes conditioned air from a room and thus results in major energy costs for laboratories and academic institutions. Efforts to curtail the energy use associated with fume hoods have been researched since the early 2000s, resulting in technical advances, such as variable air volume, high-performance and occupancy sensor-enabled fume hoods, as well as the promulgation of &quot;Shut the Sash&quot; campaigns that promote closing the window on fume hoods that are not in use to reduce the volume of air drawn from a room.

==History==

The need for ventilation has been apparent from early days of chemical research and education. Some early approaches to the problem were adaptations of the conventional chimney. A hearth constructed by Thomas Jefferson in 1822–1826 at the University of Virginia was equipped with a sand bath and special flues to vent toxic gases. The draft of a chimney was also used by Thomas Edison to provide ventilation in his work around the year 1900.

In 1904 the newly built Chemical Faculty at the Technical University in Gdańsk was equipped with fume hoods made of wood and glass in auditoria, several lecture rooms, student laboratories and rooms for scientists. Sliding up and down front panel with glass protected from fumes and explosions. Each fume hood was illuminated, equipped with gas installation for heating and running water with a drain. Harmful and corrosive gaseous byproducts of reactions were actively removed using the natural draft of a fireplace chimney. This early design is still functioning after over 110 years.

The first known modern &quot;fume cupboard&quot; design with rising sashes was introduced at the University of Leeds in 1923. 13 years later, Labconco, now a prominent fume hood manufacturer, developed the first fume hood for commercial sale, reminiscent of modern designs with a front-facing sash window. Soon after, in 1943 during World War II, John Weber, Jr. developed a fume hood concept with a dedicated exhaust fan, vertically rising sash window, and constant face velocity in response to concerns about exposure to toxic and radioactive substances. This design would become standard among atomic laboratories at the time, and many aspects of his concept are incorporated in modern fume hood designs.

The first mass-produced fume hoods were variously manufactured from stone and glass, most likely soapstone or transite, though stainless steel was being used by at least the 1960s. Labconco introduced the concept of a fume hood lined with fiberglass to improve durability and chemical resistance, though from the 1990s onward, epoxy powder-coated steel, teflon and polypropylene coatings were being recommended by literature for use in fume hood and exhaust construction.

==Description==

A fume hood is typically a large piece of equipment enclosing six sides of a work area (including a movable sash window or door), the bottom of which is most commonly located at a standing work height (at least above the floor). Fume hoods are most often found in laboratories that require the use of materials that may produce harmful particulates, gaseous by-products, or aerosols of hazardous materials such as those found in biocontainment laboratories.

Two main types of fume hood exist: Ducted and recirculating (ductless). The principle is the same for both types: air is drawn in from the front (open) side of the cabinet, and either expelled outside the building or made safe through filtration and fed back into the room. This method of airflow control is intended to:
* protect the user from hazardous substances
* protect the product or experiment
* protect the environment (when the exhaust air is filtered or otherwise prevented from escaping the work area)
* provide ventilation of the space
Secondary functions of these devices may include explosion protection, spill containment, and other functions necessary to the work being done within the device; these functions may be achieved through enclosure design, duct design, and optimal placement of the fume hood in a room.

Fume hoods are generally set back against the walls and are often fitted with infills above, to cover up the exhaust ductwork. Because of their recessed shape they are generally poorly illuminated by general room lighting, so many have internal lights with vapor-proof covers. The front of the device includes a sash window, usually in glass or otherwise transparent glazing, which is able to slide vertically or horizontally. Specialty enclosures for teaching may allow for additional visibility by constructing the sides and back of the unit from tempered glass, intended so that several individuals can look into a fume hood at once, though they often have poorer ventilation capabilities. Some demonstration models built for educational purposes are movable, can be transported between locations or are built on a movable island, and may be ductless; they are often built with less demanding restrictions on chemical resistance, but offer other advantages, such as lower energy costs.

Fume hoods are generally available in 5 different widths; 1000 mm, 1200 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm and 2000 mm. The depth varies between 700 mm and 900 mm, and the height between 1900 mm and 2700 mm. Regions that use primarily non-metric measurements often follow construction standards that round these dimensions to the closest value in inches or feet. These designs can accommodate from one to three operators. All modern designs are required to be fitted with air flow meters to ensure that the hood is working properly while in use.
For exceptionally hazardous materials, an enclosed glovebox or class III biosafety cabinet may be used, which completely isolates the operator from all direct physical contact with the work material and tools.

===Build materials===
The frame and build materials used for a fume hood are selected based on anticipated chemical and environmental exposures over the life of the equipment. Several common materials used for the exterior construction of a modern fume hood include:
* Mild steel, powder coated: The traditional method of building fume cupboards is from a zinc coated mild steel. The cost is often low, but has corrosion issues over time and a high carbon footprint to manufacture. Powder coatings may be made from epoxy or other plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride.
* Stainless steel: Typically used in radioactive applications, in cleanrooms, or in ATEX environments, as the material is easy to decontaminate. Stainless steel is less common than other materials due to its chemical vulnerability and cost.
* Polypropylene: A build material with greater chemical resistance than some contemporary materials. Also used in cleanrooms. Lower cost than mild steel or stainless steel, but less heat resistant.
Manufacturers variously construct sash windows out of safety glass, tempered glass, high impact polyvinyl chloride, or plexiglass. The most common configuration of a sash window is a type that slides vertically and is counterbalanced for ease of movement when using heavy glass. Setups that handle hydrofluoric acid may use a window made of polycarbonate.

===Liner materials===
The interior of a fume hood is often subject to damaging chemicals and elevated temperatures, and as such it is often lined with materials resistant to the chemicals and environment it is expected to be subject to. In most cases, only the working surface at the bottom of the enclosed space is made from a liner material, which is most frequently built from epoxy resin or stainless steel, but a fume hood may be lined with any of the following materials:
* Phenolic resin;
* Fiber-reinforced plastic;
* Polypropylene;
* Square-corner stainless steel for durability and heat resistance;
* Coved-corner stainless steel is easier to decontaminate, for radiochemical and biohazard applications; and
* Cement board for rough usage.

===Control and monitoring panels===
Most fume hoods are fitted with a mains-powered control panel and/or air flow-monitoring device. Typically, they will allow for the manual or automatic adjustment of internal baffles, but are required by ANSI and EN standards to provide visual and audible warnings in the following situations:

* Air flow is too high or low
* Too large an opening at the front of the unit (a &quot;high sash&quot; alarm is caused by the sliding glass at the front of the unit being raised higher than is considered safe, due to the resulting air velocity drop)
Some control panels additionally allow for switching mechanisms inside the hood from a central point, such as turning the exhaust fan or an internal light on or off.

==Ducted fume hoods==

Most fume hoods for industrial purposes are ducted. A large variety of ducted fume hoods exist. In most designs, conditioned (i.e. heated or cooled) air is drawn from the lab space into the fume hood and then dispersed via ducts into the outside atmosphere.

To reduce lab ventilation energy costs, variable air volume (VAV) systems are employed, which reduce the volume of the air exhausted as the fume hood sash is closed. This product is often enhanced by an automatic sash closing device, which will close the fume hood sash when the user leaves the fume hood face. The result is that the hoods are operating at the minimum exhaust volume whenever no one is working in front of them.

Since the typical fume hood in US climates uses 3.5 times as much energy as a home, the reduction or minimization of exhaust volume is strategic in reducing facility energy costs as well as minimizing the impact on the facility infrastructure and the environment. Particular attention must be paid to the exhaust discharge location, to reduce risks to public safety, and to avoid drawing exhaust air back into the building air supply system; exhaust requirements of fume hood systems may be regulated to prevent public and worker exposures.

===Auxiliary air===
Fume hoods with an auxiliary air supply, which draw air from outside the building rather than drawing conditioned air from the room they are placed in, have been controversial and are often not recommended. They have been considered as an option to save energy in some situations, as they do not draw out conditioned air from a room. In addition to providing a non-conditioned environment inside the hood as compared to outside the hood, which may cause discomfort or irritation to workers, chemical hoods with an auxiliary air supply have been demonstrated to expose workers to materials within the hood at a significantly higher rate than conventional non-air supply hoods.

===Constant air volume (CAV)===
Constant air volume (CAV) fume hoods maintain a consistent volume of air within the hood, regardless of the position of the sash window. This results in changes in air velocity depending on the position of the sash; the sash is adjusted to an appropriate working height to achieve adequate face velocity. In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, &quot;Lab Manager Magazine&quot; found that approximately 43% of fume hoods are CAV fume hoods.

====Non-bypass CAV====
The most basic design of a CAV fume hood only has one opening through which air can passthe sash opening. Closing the sash on a non-bypass CAV hood will increase face velocity (inflow velocity or &quot;pull&quot;), which is a function of the total volume divided by the area of the sash opening. Thus, the hood&#x27;s performance (from a safety perspective) depends primarily on sash position, with safety increasing as the hood is drawn closed. This design is referred to as a &quot;conventional&quot; hood. Many conventional hoods specify a maximum height that the sash window can be open in order to maintain safe airflow levels.

A major drawback of conventional CAV hoods is that when the sash is closed, velocities can increase to the point where they disturb instrumentation, cool hot plates, slow reactions, and/or create turbulence that can force contaminants into the room.

====Bypass CAV====

Bypass CAV hoods were developed to overcome the high velocity issues that affect conventional fume hoods. These hood allows air to be pulled through a &quot;bypass&quot; opening from above as the sash closes. The bypass is located so that as the user closes the sash, the bypass opening gets larger; when the sash is fully closed, air flows only through the airfoil underneath the bottom of the sash window. The air going through the hood maintains a constant volume no matter where the sash is positioned and without changing fan speeds. As a result, the energy consumed by CAV fume hoods (or rather, the energy consumed by the building HVAC system and the energy consumed by the hood&#x27;s exhaust fan) remains constant, or near constant, regardless of sash position.

=====Low-flow/high-performance bypass CAV=====
High-performance or low-flow bypass CAV hoods are a modern type of bypass CAV hoods and typically display improved containment, safety, and energy conservation features. These hoods include features such as sash stops on the window, automatic baffle control via sash position and airflow sensors, fans to create a barrier of air between the user and the enclosure, and improved aerodynamics to maintain laminar flow. The design of these hoods is intended to allow the unit to meet ASHRAE standards while maintaining a lower face velocity and thus consuming less energy.

===Variable air volume (VAV)===
VAV hoods, the newest generations of laboratory fume hoods, vary the volume of room air exhausted while maintaining the face velocity at a set level. Different VAV hoods change the exhaust volume using different methods, such as a damper or valve in the exhaust duct that opens and closes based on sash position, or a blower that changes speed to meet air-volume demands. Most VAV hoods integrate a modified bypass system to a conventional fume hood system to achieve a variable exhaust volume in proportion to the opening of the hood&#x27;s face, though a non-bypass design is also used to further decrease the overall volume of air required for operation.

VAV hoods can provide considerable energy savings by reducing the total volume of conditioned air exhausted from the laboratory. However, these savings are contingent on user behavior: the less the hoods are open (both in terms of height and in terms of time), the greater the energy savings. A laboratory that uses a VAV fume hood with a sash that is kept open only during working hours of the day would save a significant amount on energy costs compared to a laboratory using CAV hoods that are fully open 100% of the time, regardless of sash height.

In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, &quot;Lab Manager Magazine&quot; found that approximately 12% of fume hoods are VAV fume hoods.

===Canopy fume hoods===
Canopy fume hoods, also called exhaust canopies, are similar to the range hoods found over stoves in commercial and some residential kitchens. They have only a canopy, no enclosure, and no sash, and are designed for venting non-toxic materials such as smoke, steam, heat, and odors that are naturally carried upward through convection. Chemical-resistant filtered canopy hoods are manufactured by select vendors, but are not ideal for worker safety, as the fumes they draw in from equipment underneath pass through a worker&#x27;s breathing zone. They are employed in some situations to provide exhaust for large equipment that would be inconvenient to store or manipulate inside a fume hood enclosure, or generally in a lab bench area where processes that require additional ventilation are performed. In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, &quot;Lab Manager Magazine&quot; found that approximately 13% of fume hoods are ducted canopy fume hoods.

Canopy fume hoods require the installation of additional ductwork compared to other ducted fume hoods, and often draw a great deal more temperature-controlled air from the surrounding environment than enclosed fume hoods, but are comparatively low maintenance.

==Ductless fume hoods==
Ductless fume hoods, also known as recirculating or self-contained hoods, are units that do not extract air out of the building or work environment. Rather, air is sucked through the front opening of the hood and through a filter, before passing through the fan mounted on the top (soffit) of the hood or beneath the worktop and being fed back into the workplace. With a ductless fume hood it is essential that the filter medium be able to remove the particular hazardous or noxious material being used. As different filters are required for different materials, recirculating fume hoods should only be used when the specific hazards are known and suited to the type of filter used, and such filters have to be replaced regularly. The materials used inside the hood must also have warning properties to indicate a failure of the filter to capture particulates or vapors, such as odor or taste.The production of recirculating fume hoods was only made possible after the invention of the HEPA filter in the 1940s, and while the units were initially considered inadequate at providing worker protection from vapors, their design and performance have been improved from the 1980s onward.

Air filtration of ductless fume hoods is typically broken into two segments:
* Pre-filtration: This is the first stage of filtration, and consists of a physical barrier, typically open cell foam, which prevents large particles from passing through. Filters of this type are generally inexpensive, and last for approximately six months depending on usage.
* Main filtration: After pre-filtration, the fumes are sucked through a layer of activated charcoal which absorbs the majority of chemicals that pass through it. Ammonia and carbon monoxide will, however, pass through most carbon filters; these filters are more often designed to adsorb volatile organic compounds. Additional specific filtration techniques can be added to combat chemicals that would otherwise be pumped back into the room.
The advantages of using a ductless fume hood include their ease of implementation compared to ducted hoods, and the fact that conditioned air is not removed from the building. These factor alone provide measurable savings in energy usage. The safety and effectiveness of ductless hoods, however, is markedly lower than ducted hoods in all but the most constrained conditions. Ductless fume hoods are not appropriate for research applications where the activity, and the materials used or generated, may change or be unknown. As a result of this and other drawbacks, some research organizations, including the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Colorado, Boulder either discourage or prohibit the use of ductless fume hoods. Additionally, while typically not classified as such, the manner in which biosafety cabinets are operated when not connected to a duct system is functionally the same as a ductless fume hood, though the applications of biosafety cabinets, combined with the relative difficulty in connecting them to a building exhaust system compared to a fume hood, result in different safety considerations.

In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, &quot;Lab Manager Magazine&quot; found that approximately 22% of fume hoods are ductless fume hoods.

==Specialty designs==

===Downflow===
Downflow fume hoods, also called downflow workstations, are fume hoods designed to protect the user and the environment from hazardous vapors generated on the work surface. A downward air flow is generated and hazardous vapors are collected through slits in the work surface. Downflow fume hoods are encountered more frequently in applications involving powders, and are comparable to laminar flow cabinets. The laminar flow within these devices is easily disrupted, more so than traditional fume hoods, which can result in exposure to hazards within the hood.

===Water-wash===
Fume hood units designed for procedures involving perchloric acid feature a water-wash system in the ductwork and are often built from marine grade stainless steel or rigid polyvinyl chloride, Because dense perchloric acid fumes settle and form highly reactive perchlorate crystals, the internal baffles of the fume cupboard and ductwork must be cleaned internally with a series of sprayers, and all corners may be altered to be coved or rounded to further reduce the potential for buildup of crystals. A drain is integrated into the design for removal of wastewater solution. This design was first developed by the United States Bureau of Mines in 1964, and is sometimes referred to as an &quot;acid digestion hood&quot;.

===Radioisotope===
Fume hoods designed to handle radioactive materials are made with a coved stainless steel liner and coved integral stainless steel countertop that may be lined with lead to protect from gamma rays. Work with radioisotopes, regardless of hood design, is advised to be done over sorbent pads to prevent releases through spills. Regulations may require that any exhausted material is filtered through a regularly-replaced HEPA or activated carbon filter to avoid environmental release of radioisotopes. 

===Scrubber===
Some fume hoods are equipped with scrubber systems designed to absorb particularly hazardous chemical fumes before they are exhausted, whether for environmental or user safety concerns. The scrubber system is stocked with acid or base neutralizing salts to effectively remove the targeted chemical used in any planned procedures; this factor requires a higher level of maintenance than standard fume hoods, and also produces hazardous wastewater.

===Floor-mounted===
Also termed &quot;walk-in&quot; fume hoods, floor-mounted fume hoods have a working area that extends from the floor to the bottom of a connected exhaust duct for the use of tall equipment. Despite the name of &quot;walk-in&quot;, entering a floor-mounted fume hood in operation while it contains hazardous materials poses a significant risk to the user; they are only intended to be entered for the initial setup of equipment. Floor-mounted hoods are often equipped with multiple sashes, as a single long sash would be abnormally long if positioned for vertical movement, and have swinging doors that allow access to the lower portion of the hood.

==Energy consumption==
Because fume hoods constantly remove large volumes of conditioned (heated or cooled) air from lab spaces, they are responsible for the consumption of large amounts of energy. Fume hoods are a major factor in making laboratories four to five times more energy intensive than typical commercial buildings, and these energy requirements are exacerbated in hot and humid climates. Energy costs for a typical hood can range from $4,600/year in Los Angeles to $9,300/year in Singapore based on differences in cooling needs. The bulk of the energy that fume hoods are responsible for is the energy needed to heat and/or cool air delivered to the lab space. Additional electricity is consumed by fans in the HVAC system and fans in the fume hood exhaust system.

A number of universities run or have run programs to encourage lab users to reduce fume hood energy consumption by keeping VAV sashes closed as much as possible. For example, Harvard University&#x27;s Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology Department ran a &quot;Shut the Sash&quot; campaign, which resulted in a sustained ~30% reduction in fume hood exhaust rates. This translated into cost savings of approximately $180,000 per year, and a reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Several other institutions report on programs to reduce energy consumption by fume hoods, including:

===Hibernation===
In 2020, Cornell University sought to reduce energy consumption during times of reduced occupancy (caused by a response to the COVID-19 pandemic) by shutting off airflow to many HVAC systems, including those connected to fume hoods. The process of shutting off, or &quot;hibernating&quot;, these fume hoods turned out to be difficult to implement unilaterally across equipment of different models and ages, and only produced significant cost savings when applied over a period of more than 3 months. Process improvements allowed for the development of equipment and programs that can better implement periods of fume hood &quot;hibernation&quot;, which have been implemented across several research institutions as of 2024, including the University of Alabama, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===Use of sensors===
Person detection technology, such as motion detectors and occupancy sensors, can sense the presence of a hood operator within a zone in front of a hood. Sensor signals allow ventilation controls to switch between normal and standby or &quot;setback&quot; modes that consume less energy. Coupled with other space occupancy sensor systems, these technologies can adjust ventilation and lighting use to effectively minimize wasted energy in laboratories. However, there are safety concerns with reducing airflow in fume hoods through sensor signals if the sash is left open; some programs combine the principles of &quot;Shut the Sash&quot; campaigns with variable flow ventilation by using technology to actively remind users to close the sash of a fume hood that is not in use. Comprehensive controls on a laboratory may necessitate the use of a mechanical sash controller module that will automatically close the sash and shut off ventilation in concert with motion sensors. However, even without the use of sensors and mechanical sashes, providing reminders to fume hood users to shut the sash is more effective than doing nothing.

==Construction and installation==
Fume hoods are typically constructed with a superstructure encasing the various supporting members and inner lining of the hood. This superstructure is often built out of sheet metal, which has apertures punched into it to allow for access to plumbing and electrical receptacles or devices.

Ducted fume hoods have additional specifications necessitated by their design compared to ductless models. Seams in metal exhaust ductwork must be welded, excluding the outer end where a fan or blower is positioned. Depending on design choices and HVAC capabilities, the blower may be installed within or above the hood, or it may be positioned at the exhaust point, usually the roof of the building.

Fume hoods are installed with the intent to minimize exposure to materials used within the enclosure; as such, they are most often placed against walls and away from doors in order to prevent exposure by eddies in air caused by a door opening or closing. One EN standard requires that the face of a fume hood be installed such that it is at least from any space where there is frequent movement.

Regional standards may require the implementation of further precautions and design considerations beyond the general requirements to build a functional fume hood. These design standards may advise for considerations previously reserved for specialty hoods that improve aerodynamics and ease of cleaning, such as coved corners, beveled openings, and integrated acid-resistant sinks.

===Maintenance===

Fume hoods require regular maintenance to ensure consistent functionality; this is in addition to the standard precautions and measures taken during regular operations and ideally involves daily, periodic, and annual inspections:

*Daily fume hood inspections entail visual inspections of the fume hood for improper storage of material and other visible blockages. Airflow is often monitored for these daily inspections by taping a piece of tissue paper to the open face of the hood such that it will be drawn inward; if the tissue is not pulled inward, the hood exhaust is not functioning. 
*Periodic fume hood function inspections require the measurement of capture or face velocity with an anemometer. Specialized instruments for measuring wind speed in a fume hood or in ductwork are often referred to by trade names that indicate the mechanism of measurement, such as &quot;velometer&quot; and &quot;vaneometer&quot;. Most fume hoods are commonly recommended to maintain an average face velocity of per minute for safe operation. The minimum number of readings used to determine average face velocity varies according to ASHRAE standards, the most recent of which was produced in 2016. Fume hoods and other local exhaust devices may be smoke tested to determine if the contaminants they are designed to remove are being adequately captured and exhausted.Periodic fume hood inspections may also include checks on proper behavior of workers using the device to ensure that they are not exposed to hazardous materials through the actions of the user generating turbulence. Hoods that are not working properly, whether this is identified through an alarm on an airflow monitor or through periodic function tests, are unsafe to use, and in some situations warrant padlocking the sash closed to prevent users from accessing the device to continue work.
*Annual maintenance involves mechanical repairs (i.e. lubrication, belt adjustment, filter servicing), maintenance as recommended by the device manufacturer, or upgrades to bring the device into compliance with standards, local building codes, or to meet the specific needs of users. Organizations such as the National Institutes of Health may include wording that requires the retrofitting of already installed fume hoods in updates to their regulatory guidelines. Mechanical changes to ventilation systems or any one fume hood may also affect different devices connected to the system, which can warrant inspection and validation of connected devices after seemingly unrelated work.

<text>There are many styles of traditional and modern music of Ghana, due to Ghana&#x27;s worldwide geographic position on the African continent. 

The best known modern genre originating in Ghana is Highlife. For many years, Highlife was the preferred music genre until the introduction of Hiplife and many others.

==Traditional music==
The traditional musicology of Ghana may be divided geographically between the open and vast savanna country of northern Ghana inhabited by Ghanaians of Gur and Mande speaking groups; and the fertile, forested southern coastal areas, inhabited by Ghanaians speaking Kwa languages such as Akan.

*The northern musical traditions belong to the wider Sahelian musical traditions. It features a mix of melodic composition on stringed instruments such as the &quot;kologo&quot; lute and the &quot;gonjey&quot; fiddle, wind instruments such as flutes and horns, and voice; with polyrhythms clapped or played on the talking drum, gourd drums or &quot;brekete&quot; bass drums. The tradition of gyil music (&quot;balafon&quot;) is also common, especially in northwestern Ghana around Wa and Lawra. Music in the northern styles is mostly set to a minor pentatonic or chromatic scale and melisma plays an important part in melodic and vocal styles. There is a long history of either griot or praise-singing traditions.
*The music of the coast is associated with social functions, and relies on complex polyrhythmic patterns played with drums and bells as well as harmonized song. Drums and dance are often linked, and the tradition of royal talking drums fontomfrom (distinct from the northern talking drum) means music is widely used for communication of both tangible and esoteric topics. The most well known of southern Ghanaian drum traditions is the kete and adowa drum and bell ensembles. Music can also be linked to traditional religions. An exception to this rule is the Akan tradition of singing with the Seperewa harp-lute which had its origins in the stringed harps of the north and west.

==Gold Coast period==
During the Gold Coast era, the area was a hotbed of musical syncretism. Rhythms especially from gombe and ashiko, guitar-styles such as mainline and osibisaba, European brass bands and sea shanties, were all combined into a melting pot that became high-life.

==Mid-20th century and the invention of Ghanaian pop==
Ghana became an independent nation in 1957. The music of Ghana often reflects a Caribbean influence, yet it still retains a flavour on its own. While pan-Ghanaian music had been developed for some time, the middle of the 20th century saw the development of distinctly Ghanaian pop music. High-life incorporated elements of swing, jazz, rock, ska and soukous. To a much lesser extent, Ghanaian musicians found success in the United States and, briefly, the United Kingdom with the surprise success of Osibisa&#x27;s Afro-rock in the 1970s.

===Guitar-bands in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s===
In the 1930s, Sam&#x27;s Trio, led by Jacob Sam (Kwame Asare), was the most influential of the high-life guitar-bands. Their &quot;Yaa Amponsah&quot;, three versions of which were recorded in 1928 for Zonophone, was a major hit that remains a popular staple of numerous high-life bands. The next major guitar-band leader was E. K. Nyame, who sang in Twi. Nyame also added the double bass and more elements of the Western hemisphere, including jazz and Cuban music on the recommendation of his producer and manager E. Newman-Adjiri. In the 1960s, dance high-life was more popular than guitar-band high-life; most of the guitar bands began using the electric guitar until a roots revival in the mid-1970s.

===Dance high-life in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s===
Dance highlife evolved during World War II, when American jazz and swing became popular with the arrival of servicemen from the United States and United Kingdom. After independence in 1957, the socialist government began encouraging folk music, but highlife remained popular and influences from Trinidadian music. E. T. Mensah was the most influential musician of this period, and his band The Tempos frequently accompanied the president. The original bandleader of The Tempos was Guy Warren, who was responsible for introducing Caribbean music to Ghana and, later, was known for a series of innovative fusions of African rhythms and American jazz. Ebo Taylor, King Bruce, Jerry Hansen (musician) and Stan Plange also led influential dance bands during the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, however, pop music from Europe and the US dominated the Ghanaian scene until a mid-1970s roots revival.

===1970s: Head revival===
By the beginning of the 1970s, traditionally styled highlife had been overtaken by electric guitar bands and pop-dance music. Since 1966 and the fall of President Kwame Nkrumah, many Ghanaian musicians moved abroad, settling in the US, and UK. High-life bands arose like Sammy Kofi&#x27;s (also known as Kofi Sammy). In 1971, the Soul to Soul music festival was held in Accra. Several legendary American musicians played, including Wilson Pickett, Ike and Tina Turner and Carlos Santana. With the exception of Mexican-American Santana, these American superstars were all black, and their presence in Accra was seen as legitimizing Ghanaian music. Though the concert is now mostly remembered for its role as a catalyst in the subsequent Ghanaian roots revival, it also led to increased popularity for American rock and soul. Inspired by the American musicians, new guitar bands arose in Ghana, including Nana Ampadu &amp; the African Brothers, The City Boys and others. Musicians such as C. K. Mann, Daniel Amponsah and Eddie Donkor incorporated new elements, especially from Jamaican reggae. A group called Wulomei also arose in the 1970s, leading a cultural revival to encourage Ghanaian youths to support their own countryman&#x27;s music. By the 1980s, the UK was experiencing a boom in African music as Ghanaian and others moved there in large numbers. The group Hi-Life International was probably the most influential band of the period, and others included Jon K, Dade Krama, Orchestra Jazira and Ben Brako. In the middle of the decade, however, British immigration laws changed, and the focus of Ghanaian emigration moved to Germany.

The Ghanaian-German community created a form of highlife called Burger-highlife. The most influential early burgher highlife musician was George Darko, whose &quot;Akoo Te Brofo&quot; coined the term and is considered the beginning of the genre. Burgher highlife was extremely popular in Ghana, especially after computer-generated dance beats were added to the mix. The same period saw a Ghanaian community appear in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada. Pat Thomas is probably the most famous Ghanaian-Canadian musician. Other emigres include Ghanaian-American Obo Addy, the Ghanaian-Swiss Andy Vans and the Ghanaian-Dutch Kumbi Salleh. In Ghana itself during the 1980s, reggae became extremely popular.

===Hip-life===
By the late 1990s, a new generation of artists created a new genre of music called Hiplife. The creator of this style is Reggie Rockstone, a Ghanaian musician who dabbled with hip-hop in the United States before finding his unique style. Hiplife basically was hiphop in the Ghanaian local dialect mixed with elements of the traditional High-life. Ace music producer Hammer of The Last Two unveiled artistes including Obrafour, Tinny and Ex-doe who further popularized the Hiplife music genre respectively. Hiplife has since proliferated and spawned stars such as Reggie Rockstone, Sherifa Gunu, Ayigbe Edem, Samini and Sarkodie. Producers responsible for steering this genre to what it is today were Hammer of The Last Two, Ball J, EL and Jupitar Dancehall Artiste.

==Hip hop==
Ghanaian hip hop is a subculture and art movement which developed in Ghana during the late 1990s. The hiphop genre came into existence in Ghana through Reggie Rockstone, who is known as the hiplife father and other notable musicians such as Jayso and Ball J. It first came to Ghana as Hiplife where Reggie Rockstone introduced a fusion of hiphop beats with African sounds to create a whole new genre known as Gh hiphop.

==Afro beats==
In the late 2000s, a new generation of artists introduced the Afro beats genre into the Ghana music scene which is mostly referred to as Afro-pop. 4x4 and Fuse ODG among others popularized it and it has become part of the Ghanaian music Culture.

<text>The music of Bangladesh spans a wide variety of styles. Bangladesh claims some of the most renowned singers, composers and producers in Asia. Music has served the purpose of documenting the lives of the people and was widely patronized by the rulers. It comprises a long tradition of religious and regular song-writing over a period of almost a millennium.
== Classical music ==

=== Ragapradhan Gaan ===

Bangladeshi classical music is based on modes called &quot;ragas&quot;. In composing these songs, the melodies of north Indian &quot;dingading&quot; ragas are used. As far as the &quot;Charyagiti&quot; (9th century), ragas have been used in Bengali music. Jaydev’s Gitagovindam, Padavali Kirtan, Mangal Giti, Shyamasangit, Tappa, Brahma Sangeet and Tagore songs have been inspired by Ragas. The use of north Indian ragas in Bangla songs began in 18th century. This trend gathered momentum during the 19th and 20th centuries. The pioneers of these trend were Ramnidhi Gupta, Kali Mirza, Raghunath Roy and the founder of the Bishnupur Gharana, Ramshanker Bhattacharya. Nawab of Lakhnau, Wajid Ali Shah played an important role in this trend. He was dethroned by the British Empire in 1856 and banished to Metiaburuz, Kolkata. During his 30-year exile, he patronized music, specially dhrupad, tappa, thumri and kheyal. And, thus made a lasting impact on Bangladeshi music. All traditional Bengali music tend to be based on various variations of Hindustani Classical Music. Rabindranath Tagore had a deep appreciation for north Indian ragas, successfully introduced ragas in his songs. He was followed by Dwijendralal Roy, Rajanikanta Sen and Atulprasad Sen.

== Folk music ==


Folk has come to occupy the lives of Bangladeshis almost more than any other genre of Bengali music. Among the luminaries of the different folk traditions are Lalon Fokir, Abbasuddin Ahmed, Shah Abdul Karim, Radharaman Dutta, Hason Raja, Khursheed Nurali (Sheerazi), Ramesh Shil and Kari Amir Uddin Ahmed. Folk songs are characterised by simple musical structure and words. Before the advent of radio, entertainment in the rural areas relied on a large extent on stage performances by folk singers. With the arrival of new communication technologies and digital media, many folk songs were modernised and incorporated into &quot;modern songs&quot; (Adhunik songeet).

Folk music can be classified into several subgenres:
* Baul: mainly inspired by Lalon and almost exclusively performed by Baul mystics.
* Bhandari: Devotional music from the South (mainly Chittagong).
* Bhatiali: Music of fishermen and boatman, almost always tied by a common ragas sung solo.
* Bhawaiya: Song of bullock-cart drivers of the North (Rangpur).
* Dhamail: A form of folk music and dance originated in Sylhet and Mymensingh region. It is practiced in the Sylhet and Mymensingh division in Bangladesh and in areas influenced by the culture of Sylhet such as the Barak Valley of Assam and parts of Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur in India.
* Gazir Gaan: Devotional songs dedicated to Gazi Pir, who is part of Pach Pir tradition of folk practice and belief.
* Ghazal: Popular folk music of Sufi genres, introduced from philosophy and religion in music practiced mainly by Bengali Muslims.
* Gombhira: Song (originated in Chapai Nawabganj and Malda) performed with a particular distinctive rhythm and dance with two performers, always personifying a man and his grand father, discussing a topic to raise social awareness.
* Hason Raja: Devotional songs written by a music composer by the name of Hason Raja (from Sylhet, northeastern side of Bangladesh near Assam) that was recently repopularised as dance music.
* Jari: songs involving musical battle between two groups
* Jatra Pala: songs associated exclusively with plays (performed on-stage). Usually involves colourful presentations of historical themes.
* Jhumur: traditional dance song form Bangladesh and eastern part of India.
* Kavigan: poems sung with simple music usually presented on stage as a musical battle between poets.
* Kirtan: devotional song depicting love to Hindu God Krishna and his (best-known) lover Radha.
* Lalon: best known of all folk songs and the most important subgenre of Baul songs, almost entirely attributed to spiritual writer and composer, Lalon Fokir of Kushtia. He is known to all in West Bengal of India too.(Western Bangladesh, near the border with West Bengal).
* Pala Gaan: folk ballad also known as Pat.
* Sari: sung especially by boatmen. It is often known as workmen&#x27;s song as well.
* Shyama Sangeet: a genre of Bengali devotional songs dedicated to the Hindu goddess Shyama or Kali which is a form of supreme universal mother-goddess Durga or parvati. It is also known as Shaktagiti or Durgastuti.

=== Baul ===


Baul is the most commonly known category of Bangladeshi folk songs. It is mostly performed by hermits who are followers of Sufism and Vaishnavism in Bangladesh. Present day Sufis earn mainly from performing their music. Baul songs incorporate simple words expressing songs with deeper meanings involving creation, society, lifestyle and human emotions. The songs are performed with very little musical support to the main carrier, the vocal. Instruments used include the Ektara (&quot;one-string&quot;), Dotara (&quot;two-strings&quot;), ba(n)shi (country flute made from bamboo) and cymbals.

=== &quot;রবীন্দ্র সঙ্গীত (Music of Robindra)&quot; ===

Rabindra Sangeet ( &quot;Robindro shonggit&quot;, ), also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore. They have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh. &quot;Sangeet&quot; means music, &quot;Rabindra Sangeet&quot; means Songs of Rabindra.

Rabindra Sangeet used Indian classical music and traditional folk music as sources.

=== &quot;নজরুল গীতি (Music of Nazrul)&quot; ===

Nazrul Geeti or Nazrul Sangeet, literally &quot;music of Nazrul,&quot; are songs written and composed by Kazi Nazrul Islam, a Bengali poet and national poet of Bangladesh and active revolutionary during the Indian Independence Movement. Nazrul Sangeet incorporate revolutionary notions as well as more spiritual, philosophical and romantic themes.

=== &quot;শাহ আবদুল করিম (Music of Shah Abdul Karim)&quot; ===

Shah Abdul Karim known as &quot;Baul Samrat&quot; or king of baul music, he has composed over 1600 baul songs, some of his notable songs include Keno Piriti Baraila Re Bondhu, Murshid Dhono He Kemone Chinibo Tomare, Nao Banailo Banailo Re Kon Mestori, Ashi Bole Gelo Bondhu and Mon Mojale Ore Bawla Gaan. He referred to his compositions as Baul Gaan. He holds voice against unfairness, injustice, prejudice and communalism through his writings. Karim portraits Bhati area&#x27;s people love, wish and happiness amid the writings. He got inspiration from another legendary musician Fakir Lalon Shah. Karim wrote many spiritual songs including Marfati or Dehatatta. Bangla Academy has translated ten songs of his in the English language. Karim wrote many spiritual songs including Marfati or Dehatatta. Bangla Academy has translated ten songs of his in English.

=== &quot;লালন গীতি (Music of Lalon)&quot; ===

Lalon also known as Fakir Lalon Shah, Lalon Shah, Lalon Fakir. Lalon composed numerous songs and poems, which describe his philosophy. Lalon left no written copies of his songs, which were transmitted orally and only later transcribed by his followers. Also, most of his followers could not read or write either, so few of his songs are found in written form.

== Pop music ==
Western style popular music began to influence strongly the music of Bangladesh in the early 1970&#x27;s. And then several recording studios were established in Dhaka, which produced many pop style songs about national heroes. Ferdous Wahid, who started out as a singer in the early 1970s, said &quot;I wanted to introduce western music in Bangladesh, so after the Liberation War I decided to do pop music for our country’s people&quot;.

Azam Khan, Fakir Alamgir, Ferdous Wahid, Pilu Momtaz, Najma Zaman, and Firoz Shai are considered the pioneer who brought the glory to Bangladesh pop music. In particular, Azam Khan is known as the pop-guru or pop-samrat of Bangladesh.

In the genre of film music, well-known are such singers as Sabina Yasmin, Runa Laila, Andrew Kishore and so on. Sabina Yasmin has won Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer 14 times, and Runa Laila has won the award 7 times.

<text>Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! is the second studio album by Icelandic alternative rock band the Sugarcubes, released on 20 September 1989 through Elektra Records. A version of the album sung in Icelandic titled &quot;Illur Arfur!&quot; (English: &quot;Bad Legacy!&quot;) was released as well, with the same English track listing, under the name of Sykurmolarnir (Sugarcubes in Icelandic). The album reached number 70 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 15 on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK Indie Albums chart. The album was not as well received by critics as their critically acclaimed debut album, &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot;, and was criticized for Einar&#x27;s greater vocal contribution.

The album spawned three singles: &quot;Regina&quot;, which reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; and &quot;Planet&quot;. Music videos were released for all three singles, as well as &quot;Eat the Menu&quot;.

The name of the album was inspired by Mr. Toad from the famous children&#x27;s book &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

<text>The Twelve Minor Prophets (, &quot;Shneim Asar&quot;; , &quot;Trei Asar&quot;, &quot;Twelve&quot;; , &quot;the Twelve Prophets&quot;), or the Book of the Twelve, is a collection of prophetic books, written between about the 8th and 4th centuries BCE, which are in both the Jewish Tanakh and Christian Old Testament.

In the Tanakh, they appear as a single book, &quot;The Twelve&quot;, which is the last book of the &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;, the second of three major divisions of the Tanakh. In the Christian Old Testament, the collection appears as twelve individual books, one for each of the prophets: the Book of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Their order, and position in the Old Testament, varies slightly between the Protestant, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles.

The name &quot;Minor Prophets&quot; goes back apparently to St. Augustine, who distinguished the 12 shorter prophetic books as &quot;prophetae minores&quot; from the four longer books of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

Scholars generally believe that each Book of the Twelve Prophets has an original core of prophetic tradition attributed to the respective figure it&#x27;s named after, containing autobiographical, biographical, and oracular material. The Twelve were likely collected into a single scroll by the Achaemenid period, with the order possibly reflecting both chronological and thematic considerations, although some debate exists over dating and sequence.

==Composition==
===Individual books===
Scholars usually assume that there exists an original core of prophetic tradition behind each book which can be attributed to the figure after whom it is named. In general, each book includes three types of material:
* Autobiographical material in the first person, some of which may go back to the prophet in question;
* Biographical materials about the prophet in the third person – which incidentally demonstrate that the collection and editing of the books was completed by persons other than the prophets themselves;
* Oracles or speeches by the prophets, usually in poetic form, and drawing on a wide variety of genres, including covenant lawsuit, oracles against the nations, judgment oracles, messenger speeches, songs, hymns, narrative, lament, law, proverb, symbolic gesture, prayer, wisdom saying, and vision.
The noteworthy exception is the Book of Jonah, an anonymous work which contains a narrative about the prophet Jonah.

===As a collection===
It is not known when these short works were collected and transferred to a single scroll, but the first extra-biblical evidence for the Twelve as a collection is c. 190 BCE in the writings of Yeshua ben Sirach, and evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls suggests that the modern order of the Tanakh, which would potentially include the twelve, had been established by 150 BCE. It is believed that initially the first six were collected, and later the second six were added; the two groups seem to complement each other, with &quot;Hosea&quot; through &quot;Micah&quot; raising the question of iniquity, and &quot;Nahum&quot; through &quot;Malachi&quot; proposing resolutions.

Many, though not all, modern scholars agree that the editing process which produced the Book of the Twelve reached its final form in Jerusalem during the Achaemenid period (538–332 BCE), although there is disagreement over whether this was early or late.

The comparison of different ancient manuscripts indicates that the order of the individual books was originally fluid. The arrangement found in current Bibles is roughly chronological. First come those prophets dated to the early Assyrian period: Hosea, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah; Joel is undated, but it was possibly placed before Amos because parts of a verse near the end of Joel (3.16 [&quot;4.16 in Hebrew&quot;]) and one near the beginning of Amos (1.2) are identical. Also we can find in both Amos (4.9 and 7.1–3) and Joel a description of a plague of locusts. These are followed by prophets that are set in the later Assyrian period: Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah. Last come those set in the Persian period: Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, although some scholars date &quot;Second Zechariah&quot; to the Hellenistic Era. However it is important to note that chronology was not the only consideration, as &quot;It seems that an emphatic focus on Jerusalem and Judah was [also] a main concern. For example, Obadiah is generally understood as reflecting the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE, and would therefore fit later in a purely chronological sequence.

===Sequence of books===

In the Hebrew Bible, these works are counted as one anthology. The works appear in the same order in Jewish, Protestant and Catholic Bibles, but in Eastern Orthodox Christian Bibles they are ordered according to the Septuagint. The books are in rough chronological order, according to explicit statements within the books themselves.

The twelve books are:
===Academic debates===

In the 21st century, “claims for Persian period influence or origins have ballooned.”

The recent Oxford Handbook of the Minor Prophets Jason Radine summarizes the ongoing “Persian Turn” in Minor Prophets scholarship. It refers to a scholarly trend towards dating much of the biblical composition and editing of the Minor Prophets to the Persian period (539–323 BCE). This trend is rooted in earlier scholarly theories, such as the Graf-Wellhausen Hypothesis, which suggested that elements of the Pentateuch, particularly the “Priestly” writings, originated during the Persian era. Additionally, Spinoza’s 17th-century argument that Ezra authored large portions of the Hebrew Bible influenced this perspective.

This trend has gained momentum as a growing number of scholars now posit that many prophetic books, once assumed to date from earlier periods, were likely finalized or significantly edited during the Persian period. Researchers like Reinhard Kratz distinguish between the original oracles of ancient Near Eastern prophets and the later literary works attributed to them, which reflect the scribal efforts of later editors.

This theory has been opposed by other scholars, however. For instance, Heath Dewrell argues that many literary features of the Book of Hosea are also attested in Neo-Assyrian prophecies. Since these prophetic texts were written close to the time of Hosea and were not substantially edited centuries after their authors&#x27; time, Dewrell finds no reason to think that the biblical book underwent any major editing either.

While dating texts from the Persian period is appropriate for books like Haggai and Zechariah, which explicitly mention that era, scholars caution against oversimplifying the dating process. Radine argues that categorizing too much biblical material as Persian-era production risks obscuring the complex, long-term development of biblical literature. In particular, the diversity of themes, literary styles, and theological perspectives in the Minor Prophets suggests that their formation spanned a much longer period than the Persian era alone.

The scholar Ehud Ben Zvi suggests that much of the biblical material from the Persian period was produced within the relatively small and interconnected community of Jerusalem, where scribes were likely aware of each other’s works. This view emphasizes the importance of understanding how these texts were shaped within their historical and cultural contexts. However, Radine argues that this approach risks overlooking earlier material that predated the Persian period but was later edited or integrated into these texts.

==Christian commemoration==
In the Roman Catholic Church, the twelve minor prophets are read in the Tridentine Breviary during the fourth and fifth weeks of November, which are the last two weeks of the liturgical year, before Advent.

In Year 1 of the modern Lectionary, Haggai, Zechariah, Jonah, Malachi, and Joel are read in weeks 25–27 of Ordinary Time. In Year 2, Amos, Hosea, and Micah are read in weeks 14–16 of Ordinary Time. In Year 1 of the two-year cycle of the Office of Readings in the Liturgy of the Hours, Micah 4 and 7 are read in the third week of Advent; Amos, Hosea, Micah, Zephaniah, Nahum, and Habakkuk are read in weeks 22–29 of Ordinary Time. In Year 2, Haggai and Zechariah 1–8 are read in weeks 11–12 of Ordinary Time; Obadiah, Joel, Malachi, Jonah, and Zechariah 9–14 are read in Week 18.

They are collectively commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31.

<doc id="245867" wikidata="Q1002254" url="?curid=245867" title="Wacky Races (1968 TV series)">
<text>Wacky Races is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with Heatter-Quigley Productions. It aired on CBS as part of its Saturday-morning schedule from September 14, 1968, to January 4, 1969 and then reruns the next season. The series features 11 different cars racing against each other in various road rallies throughout North America, with all of the drivers hoping to win the title of the &quot;World&#x27;s Wackiest Racer&quot;. The show was inspired by the 1965 comedy film &quot;The Great Race&quot;. This was the only non-game show produced by Heatter-Quigley; the show was intended as a game show in which children would guess the winner of each race, and those who answered correctly would win prizes, but CBS dropped these elements during development.

The cartoon had many regular characters, with 23 people and animals on the 11 race cars. After its network run on CBS, &quot;Wacky Races&quot; ran in syndication from 1976 to 1982. Seventeen 20-minute episodes were produced, with each of them featuring two 10-minute segments.

The series spawned numerous spin-offs featuring Dick Dastardly through the years, the most similar in theme being &quot;Fender Bender 500&quot; in 1990.

In 2017, the series was remade as a reboot airing on Boomerang. It aired on Cartoon Network on August 13, 2018.

== Plot ==
The cartoon revolves around several racers with various themes who are each allowed to use strange gimmicks to compete against other racers in many races across North America as the race announcer (voiced by Dave Willock) talks about the race while interacting with the racers.

The racers consist of:

* The Slag Brothers, Rock and Gravel (vocal effects provided by Daws Butler and Don Messick), two cavemen that drive the Boulder Mobile (1); their car is made out of rock and the brothers (who talk in caveman-like gibberish but with occasional intelligible words) power it up by hitting it on both sides with their clubs and are also able to re-build it from bare rock, always using their clubs. Rock and Gravel have long body hair that covers their body except for their noses, arms, and legs.
* The Gruesome Twosome, Tiny &quot;Big Gruesome&quot; (voiced by Daws Butler) and Bela &quot;Little Gruesome&quot; (voiced by Don Messick), who are monsters that drive the Creepy Coupe (2); their horror-themed car includes a small bell tower inhabited by a fire-breathing dragon, bats, ghosts, and other creatures. The Creepy Coupe&#x27;s special booster is &quot;dragon power,&quot; with the dragon acting as a RATO unit.
* Professor Pat Pending (voiced by Don Messick), an inventor who drives the Convert-a-Car (3); he can transform his car into pretty much anything that moves.
* The Red Max (voiced by Daws Butler), a Manfred von Richthofen-styled aviator who speaks with a German accent that drives car/airplane hybrid called the Crimson Haybaler (4); his vehicle is able to fly, although only for short distances in ground effect. His name is a portmanteau of Red Baron and Blue Max.
* Penelope Pitstop (voiced by Janet Waldo), the lone female driver, in a 1930s racing costume that drives the Compact Pussycat (5); a Southern belle, Penelope seems more concerned with her looks than with racing and often gets herself into trouble. Nevertheless, she is a skilled racer.
* Sergeant Blast (voiced by Daws Butler) and Private Meekly (voiced by Paul Winchell), two soldiers in an armored car/tank hybrid called the Army Surplus Special (6); the Sergeant uses &quot;fire power&quot; (i.e. shooting cannonballs from his turret) to temporarily boost power in the car.
* The Ant Hill Mob, a group of dwarf gangsters led by Clyde (voiced by Paul Winchell) and is composed of him, Ring-A-Ding (voiced by Don Messick), Rug Bug Benny, Mac, Danny, Kirby and Willy, in the Bulletproof Bomb (7); they are sometimes preoccupied with getting caught by the police and are able to use &quot;getaway power&quot;, which involves all the gangsters (except for Clyde) extending their legs through the bottom of the car and running.
* Lazy Luke (voiced by John Stephenson), a barefoot hillbilly, and Blubber Bear (vocal effects provided by John Stephenson), a timid, cry-baby brown bear, in the Arkansas Chuggabug (8); Luke maneuvers the steering wheel with his feet and his car is steam-powered from an old rickety boiler. Blubber has been known to blow up a balloon and use it as an air jet for briefly increased speed.
* Peter Perfect (voiced by Daws Butler), a gentlemanly racer in the Turbo Terrific (9); Peter is extremely strong, but also very vain, and he often boasts about the virtues of his high-tech race car – which regularly falls to pieces seconds after he praises it. He is fond of Penelope and often helps her out.
* Rufus Ruffcut (voiced by Daws Butler), a lumberjack and his beaver companion Sawtooth (vocal effects provided by Don Messick) in the Buzz Wagon (10); their car, entirely made of wood, features four circular saw blades as wheels and Sawtooth is able to cut through obstacles (such as trees and other objects) at super-high speed.
* Dick Dastardly (voiced by Paul Winchell), an archetypal mustache-twirling villain and his wheezily snickering dog Muttley (voiced by Don Messick) in the Mean Machine (00); their sinister vehicle is a purple, rocket-powered car with an abundance of concealed weapons and the ability to fly. Dastardly&#x27;s usual race strategy revolves around using the Mean Machine&#x27;s great speed to get ahead of the other racers and then setting a trap to stop them and maintain the lead, but most of his plans backfire, causing him to fall back into last place. In the opening title sequence, Dastardly attempts to stall the racers by chaining their cars to a pole, but then he accidentally shifts his car into reverse, bumps into and breaks the pole and frees the others as the race begins.

The show gave the results of each race at the end of each episode (the first, second, and third placings are given by the narrator, and the narrative sometimes saw some or all of the other cars cross the finish line) as well as what happened with Dick Dastardly after his last scheme&#x27;s failure. The show never indicated a particular scoring system or way to determine who won the Wacky Races as a whole. The cumulative totals for first-, second-, and third-place finishes for each contestant are presented below:

== Spin-offs and similar series ==
In 1969, Dick Dastardly and Muttley were given a spin-off series, titled &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. The series is sometimes mistakenly known as &quot;Stop the Pigeon&quot;, after the show&#x27;s working title and theme song. In the same year, Penelope Pitstop and the Ant Hill Mob were spun off into another animated series, titled &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;. Both series ran for a season each.

In 1977, &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot; debuted. The titular Captain Caveman was modeled after the Slag Brothers.

In 1990, a cartoon segment in &quot;Wake, Rattle and Roll&quot; named &quot;Fender Bender 500&quot; was produced. The show followed the same premise as &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, but had racers drive monster trucks and races took place on various parts of the world. Only Dick Dastardly and Muttley returned from among the original &quot;Wacky Races&quot; cast; all other racers were from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; and &quot;Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy&quot;. Unlike in &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, here Dastardly and Muttley were able to actually win some of the races, though they still had the fewest number of race wins out of all racers.

In 2006, the animated short for a spin-off series titled &quot;Wacky Races Forever&quot; was produced for Cartoon Network. The series depicted a roster of both new and returning racers competing against each other. Penelope Pitstop and Peter Perfect had married and created Perfect Industries, the corporate sponsor of the new Wacky Races, whereas their children Parker and Piper competed in the race. Other characters included the Slag Brothers, Professor Pat Pending (depicted here with a mad scientist personality), a teenage version of the Gruesome Twosome, and Dick Dastardly and Muttley (working for a new villain named Mr. Viceroy, who sought to steal Perfect Industries). The series was not picked up by Cartoon Network.

In 2016, DC Comics launched a comic series called &quot;Wacky Raceland&quot;. It was a dark and gritty reimagining of the series set after the Apocalypse in a similar vein to the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchise. The comic ran for six issues from May to December 2016.

A reboot and sequel—also produced by Hanna-Barbera (in-name-only)—was released on Boomerang&#x27;s SVOD service in 2017. It also aired on the Boomerang channels around the world starting later in the year.

On June 15, 2022, it was announced a stop-motion &quot;Wacky Races&quot; series produced by Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe was in production and would have aired on Cartoon Network. The project was later cancelled with only a short pilot being completed.

In 2024, a supposed plot intro of a Japanese anime intro made by AC-bu with music from PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB and chelmico, later was found that a series of shorts called &quot;Wacky Races: Japan Tour&quot; was under production.

In 2025, Dynamite Entertainment will publish a &quot;Wacky Races&quot; comic titled &quot;Giant Size Wacky Races&quot; in April 2025.

====&quot;Scoob!&quot; (2020)====

Dick Dastardly (voiced by Jason Isaacs) and Muttley (voiced by Billy West and archived laugh recordings by Don Messick) made an appearance as the main villains in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; feature film, &quot;Scoob!&quot;, released on May 15, 2020. Rock and Gravel Slag made cameo appearances during the prehistoric gladiator scene. Various drawings of the Wacky Racers cameo on Dick Dastardly&#x27;s prison cell on the wall during the credits. Penelope Pitstop was to appear physically as a main character interacting with Scooby and Shaggy according to concept art, but she instead makes a brief cameo on a video game cabinet themed around her.

In 2018, an animated film based on &quot;Wacky Races&quot; was reported to be in development by Warner Animation Group.

== Video games ==
The main plot of &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, in which characters racing on unusual fictional vehicles and using various over-the-top &quot;weapons&quot; to hinder their opponents, would later go on to inspire the kart racing video game genre in the 1990s. &quot;Wacky Races&quot; eventually has its own video game series since 1991, preceding Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, which was considered as the foremost game of this kind. Various video games based on the series have been produced.
* &quot;Wacky Races&quot; (1991)
* Chiki Chiki Machine Mō Race (3DO)
* Chiki Chiki Machine Mō Race 2: In Space (3DO)
* &quot;Wacky Races&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Wacky Races: Starring Dastardly and Muttley&quot;
* &quot;Wacky Races: Mad Motors&quot;
* &quot;Wacky Races: Crash and Dash&quot;

In 1993, Sega released a medal game based on the series, exclusively in Japan. It was a racing game, but the outcome of the race depended entirely on luck. The PS2 game &quot;Wacky Races: Starring Dastardly and Muttley&quot; is notable for allowing players to have Dick Dastardly finally win a race. The narrator is taken aback or disgusted and Dastardly is happy and surprised at winning a race. In 2007, Heiwa released a pachinko game titled &quot;Kenken Aloha de Hawaii&quot;. Later in 2007, another game called &quot;Wacky Races: Mad Motors&quot; for the PlayStation 2 was released by Blast Entertainment on June 12. A new video game for the Wii and Nintendo DS consoles titled &quot;Wacky Races: Crash and Dash&quot; was released on June 27, 2008. This game was developed by Eidos. In 2009, another arcade game was released by Banpresto, which was a more traditional racing game. It ran on the Taito Type X2, and was released internationally by Gamewax.

==Figures==

A three-disc DVD release of the complete series was made available in Japan on August 10, 2001, and had both English and Japanese audio. In Great Britain, Warner released a three-disc set with no extra features, which was only available in Virgin Megastores. The complete box set of &quot;Wacky Races&quot; was released on July 31, 2006, as an HMV exclusive but is essentially the standard Volumes 1–3 with no extras. The Australian release of Volume 1 and 2 was made available in 2005 and Volume 3 released in 2007.

Warner Home Video released the entire series, with commentaries and other extras, in a DVD box set on October 19, 2004.

On February 14, 2017, Warner Archive re-released &quot;Wacky Races: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection as a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release.

== The cars and characters in other media ==
Life-size working replicas of the vehicles have been built in the U.K. (where the show was very popular) and appear annually at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, with new additions each year. The year 2008 saw the last of the cars (the Ant Hill Mob in the Bulletproof Bomb #7) added to the collection, making a complete set.

The &quot;Digimon Frontier&quot; episode &quot;Trailmon vs. Trailmon&quot; paid tribute to the show.

In 2006, the car manufacturer Vauxhall launched a television commercial for the British market, parodying &quot;Wacky Races&quot; with a similar setup featuring Corsa cars. The commercial made several references to the cartoon as well as utilizing the show&#x27;s theme music and Muttley&#x27;s iconic snicker.

The English adult comic &quot;Viz&quot; had a one-off parody strip called &quot;Wacky Racists&quot; with David Irving as Dick Dastardly, Unity Mitford as Penelope Pitstop, Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche as Lazy Luke, Oswald Mosley as Muttley, and comedian Bernard Manning in the &quot;Fatcuntmobile&quot;.

In 2013, the car manufacturer Peugeot launched a TV commercial for the Brazilian market (and later used in Spain and Turkey), featuring the cartoon characters in a real-life universe.

&quot;Wacky Races&quot; was also seen in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Handicar&quot;.

Dick Dastardly and Muttley made a cameo in the &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; episode &quot;Uncle Grandpa Retires&quot;.

The Buzz Wagon appeared in the &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; episode &quot;Crossover Nexus&quot;.

Dick Dastardly, Muttley, and Penelope Pitstop appear in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; as part of the spectators of the big game, and Penelope is the Compact Pussycat the whole time. Dastardly and Muttley also appear in their &quot;Scoob!&quot; forms.

The Army Surplus Special appeared in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; episode &quot;My Doggie Dave&quot;.

<text>Cypermethrin (CP) is a synthetic pyrethroid used as an insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications as well as in consumer products for domestic purposes. It behaves as a fast-acting neurotoxin in insects. It is easily degraded on soil and plants but can be effective for weeks when applied to indoor inert surfaces. It is a non-systemic and non-volatile insecticide that acts by contact and ingestion, used in agriculture and in pest control products. Exposure to sunlight, water and oxygen will accelerate its decomposition. Cypermethrin is highly toxic to fish, bees and aquatic insects, according to the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) (previously National Pesticides Telecommunication Network) in the USA. It is found in many household ant and cockroach killers, including Raid, Ortho, Combat, ant chalk, and some products of Baygon in Southeast Asia.

==Uses==
Cypermethrin is used in agriculture to control ectoparasites which infest cattle, sheep, and poultry.

==Human exposure==
Cypermethrin is moderately toxic through skin contact or ingestion. It may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. Symptoms of dermal exposure include numbness, tingling, itching, burning sensation, loss of bladder control, incoordination, seizures and possible death.

Pyrethroids may adversely affect the central nervous system. Human volunteers given dermal doses of 130μg/cm on the earlobe experienced local tingling and burning sensations. One man died after eating a meal cooked in a 10% cypermethrin/oil mix that was mistakenly used for cooking oil. Shortly after the meal, the victim experienced nausea, prolonged vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea which progressed to convulsions, unconsciousness and coma. Other family members exhibited milder symptoms and survived after hospital treatment.

It may cause allergic skin reactions in humans. Excessive exposure can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, salivation, shortness of breath and seizures.

In humans, cypermethrin is deactivated by enzymatic hydrolysis to several carboxylic acid metabolites, which are eliminated in the urine. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdosage may be confirmed by quantitation of cypermethrin in blood or plasma.

==Study in animals==
Cypermethrin is very toxic to cats which cannot tolerate the therapeutic doses for dogs. This is associated with UGT1A6 deficiency in cats, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing cypermethrin. As a consequence, cypermethrin remains much longer in the cat&#x27;s organs than in dogs or other mammals and can be fatal in large doses.

In male rats cypermethrin has been shown to exhibit a toxic effect on the reproductive system by Elbetieha et al. 2001. In another result, after 15 days of continual dosing, both androgen receptor levels and serum testosterone levels were significantly reduced. These data suggested that cypermethrin can induce impairments of the structure of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis in male rats at high doses.

Long-term exposure to cypermethrin during adulthood is found to induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rats, and postnatal exposure enhances the susceptibility of animals to dopaminergic neurodegeneration if rechallenged during adulthood.

If exposed to cypermethrin during pregnancy, rats give birth to offspring with developmental delays. In male rats exposed to cypermethrin, the proportion of abnormal sperm increases. It causes genetic damage: chromosomal abnormalities increased in bone marrow and spleen cells when mice were exposed to cypermethrin. Cypermethrin is classified as a possible human carcinogen, because it causes an increase in the frequency of lung tumors in female mice. Cypermethrin has been linked to an increase in bone marrow micronuclei in both mice and humans.
One study showed that cypermethrin inhibits “gap junctional intercellular communication”, which plays an important role in cell growth and is inhibited by carcinogenic agents. Studies have shown that residue from cypermethrin can last for 84 days in the air, on walls, the floor and on furniture.

==Environmental effects==
Cypermethrin is a broad-spectrum insecticide, which means it kills beneficial insects as well as the targeted insects. Fish are particularly susceptible to cypermethrin, but when used as directed, application around residential sites poses little risk to aquatic life. Resistance to cypermethrin has developed quickly in insects exposed frequently and can render it ineffective.

<text>The major prophets is a grouping of books in the Christian Old Testament that does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. All of these books are traditionally regarded as authored by the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. The term major prophets refers to the length of the books and not the achievement or importance of the prophets. In comparison to the books of the Twelve Minor Prophets, whose books are short and grouped together into one single book in the Hebrew Bible, the books of the major prophets are much longer.

== The order of the books ==
===Hebrew Bible===
The Tanakh, often called the Hebrew Bible, is separated into three sections: the Torah, the Nevi&#x27;im (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). The Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah, and the Book of Ezekiel are included among the Nevi&#x27;im. The Book of Lamentations and the Book of Daniel are included among the Ketuvim. The Hebrew Bible does not include the Book of Baruch.

===Catholic Bible===
Along with the books in the Hebrew Bible, the Catholic Bible includes the Letter of Jeremiah which is found in Chapter 6 of the Book of Baruch. This was written by Baruch ben Neriah, a scribe of Jeremiah.

===Protestant Bible===
Most Protestant Bibles include only the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah, the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Ezekiel, and the Book of Daniel.

==Period of Prophecy==
All the books of the major prophets took place during the &quot;Period of Prophecy&quot;, which covers the time from the entrance of the Israelites into the Land of Israel until the Babylonian captivity of Judah. It is understood from all versions of the books that during this time, the four major prophets were chosen by God to be spoken to and speak the divine word to the people.

=== Isaiah ===
The Book of Isaiah tells primarily of prophecies of the judgments awaiting nations that are persecuting Judah.

=== Jeremiah ===
The Book of Jeremiah was written as a message to the Jews in exile in Babylon, explaining the disaster of exile as God&#x27;s response to Israel&#x27;s pagan worship.

=== Lamentations ===
The Book of Lamentations tells of the mourning the desertion of the city by God, its destruction, and the ultimate return of the divinity.

=== Ezekiel ===
The Book of Ezekiel tells of the judgements on Israel and the nation and also the future blessings of Israel.

=== Daniel ===
The Book of Daniel tell of God&#x27;s plans to save all Israel in their present oppression, just as he saved Daniel from his enemies.

<text>Ray Henderson (born Raymond Brost; December 1, 1896 – December 31, 1970) was an American songwriter.

==Early life==
Born in Buffalo, New York, Henderson moved to New York City and became a popular composer in Tin Pan Alley. He was one-third of a successful songwriting and music publishing team with Lew Brown and Buddy De Sylva from 1925 through 1930, responsible for several editions of the revue called &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; and such book musicals as &quot;Good News&quot;, &quot;Hold Everything!&quot;, and &quot;Follow Thru&quot;. After De Sylva&#x27;s departure, Henderson continued to write with Brown through 1933.

Then, he worked with other partners. In 1934, he composed the musical &quot;Say When&quot; with lyricist Ted Koehler.

==Career==
Henderson&#x27;s biggest hit songs included &quot;Annabelle&quot; (1923), &quot;Alabamy Bound&quot; (1924), &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Girl?&quot; (a/k/a &quot;Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue&quot;), &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Lulu&quot; (all 1925), &quot;The Birth of the Blues&quot;, &quot;It All Depends on You&quot; (both 1926), &quot;The Varsity Drag&quot;, &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; (both 1927), &quot;You&#x27;re the Cream in My Coffee&quot;, &quot;Button Up Your Overcoat&quot;, &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; (all 1928), &quot;You Are My Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Dreamer, Aren&#x27;t We All&quot;, &quot;(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up&quot; (all 1929), &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries&quot; (both 1931), and &quot;Animal Crackers in My Soup&quot; (1935).

Henderson also worked as an accompanist to song and dance acts in Vaudeville. His last Broadway show was a resuscitation of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, one of several put on after Ziegfeld&#x27;s death. Henderson&#x27;s, in 1943, had the longest run of any &quot;Follies&quot; at 553 performances. He effectively retired from composing in the late 1940s, and worked on an opera which was never completed.

==Death==
Henderson died of a heart attack in Greenwich, Connecticut on December 31, 1970, at the age of 74.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Good News&quot; has been adapted for film twice; in 1930 and in 1947.

The 1956 film &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; was a dramatization of the songwriting team of Henderson, Brown and De Sylva; Henderson was played by Dan Dailey. The film included many of the trio&#x27;s songs.

In 2000, a revue of Henderson&#x27;s music called &quot;It&#x27;s the Cherries&quot; opened in New York City as the inaugural show of the American Composer Series.

<text>Ephedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant &quot;Ephedra sinica&quot;. Several additional species belonging to the genus &quot;Ephedra&quot; have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine, in which it is referred to as Ma Huang, for more than 2,000 years. Native Americans and Mormon pioneers drank a tea brewed from other &quot;Ephedra&quot; species, called &quot;Mormon tea&quot; and &quot;Indian tea&quot;.
Dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids are unsafe, with reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths. In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally.

==Biochemistry and effects==

A wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of &quot;Ephedra&quot;. Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.

Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.

Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.

Adverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.

==Purity and dosage==

There are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.

==Regulation in the United States==
Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.

===Initial concerns and industry response===

In 1997, in response to mounting concern over the serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.

In response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that Ephedra was safe. The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block the publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.

Metabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company&#x27;s products to the FDA. Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA&#x27;s proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch&#x27;s son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.

In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas. &quot;Business Week&quot; reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been &quot;beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.&quot;

In 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.

===Additional evidence and deaths===

A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA. Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer from heatstroke in 2001.

Steve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a &quot;significant role&quot; in Bechler&#x27;s sudden death. Following Bechler&#x27;s death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, &quot;All of a sudden [after Bechler&#x27;s death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act.&quot;

Senator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA&#x27;s attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that &quot;...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist&quot;, and called FDA action to regulate ephedra &quot;long overdue.&quot;

===Ephedrine supplement ban===

In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra&#x27;s safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects. Almost simultaneously, a study in &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;.

On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that &quot;...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.&quot; Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.

===Legal challenges===

Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA&#x27;s ban of Ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given to the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA&#x27;s regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of Utah&#x27;s Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.

The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA&#x27;s ban on Ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000-page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency&#x27;s finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.

==Use in sports==

Ephedrine is listed as a banned substance by both the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The National Football League banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Korey Stringer; ephedra was found in Stringer&#x27;s locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death. The substance is also banned by the National Basketball Association. It was also banned by Major League Baseball after the 2003 death of Steve Bechler. Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra believing it enhanced their athletic performance.

===Prominent cases===
In the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Argentine footballer Diego Armando Maradona tested positive for ephedrine. The Japanese motorcycle racer Noriyuki Haga tested positive for ephedrine in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result. NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.

== Connections to Soma rituals ==

=== History of Soma ===

Throughout the many hymns, prayers, and philosophy found in the Vedas (written around 1500 BC), a mysterious plant is mentioned often and with great reverence. This plant alternates from a holy substance to an actual personified god and is considered a teacher, doctor, medicine, a bringer of insight, and a vector of inspiration. The deity version of Soma was associated with medicinal herbs and the moon and was considered a bringer of health and prosperity. The plant was an essential aspect of Vedic religion to alter one’s mind, enabling communion with the divine. The ritual drinking of Soma was also found in the ancient Zoroastrian text, the Avesta. The rituals and importance of the plant were very similar to those in Vedic culture but were instead called by the name &quot;haoma&quot;. It is unknown why, but eventually in both the Vedic and Zoroastrian cultures a substitute substance was used in these religious ceremonies and over time the definitive identity of Soma-Haoma has been lost. There is much debate over which species of plant are the sacred plant of the Vedic and Zoroastrian faiths.

=== Ritual use of Ephedra ===

The Rigveda is one of the four oldest and most sacred collections of stories in Hinduism. In the Rigveda soma is a drink consumed by two of the main gods; Agni and Indra. In the texts, the drink helped the gods in battle by strengthening them physically. Because of this, soma was given and consumed by warriors before wartime or a battle. The drink was supposed to give the warriors strength and luck in the upcoming conflict. Immortality is also a quality associated with soma due to it being a drink of the divine. At religious ceremonies the drink was consumed to give consumers longevity in life. At birth the drink was also given to the babies for these same reasons. 

In Zoroastrianism, the drink is called haoma and has similar uses. Just like in Hinduism, the drink was related to immortality and long life. Haoma was the first thing newborns drank. This assured the child would be healthy and live a long life. The drink was also administered to people close to death to revive them back into good health.

The physical appearance of Ephedra is also a reason it is believed to be the soma plant. According to the Vedic text Rigveda, the plant comprising soma is shaped like an arrow. Ephedra sinica is a gymnosperm that forms stalks with buds on the end. It is easy to see how this shape could be described as an arrow. Another text refers to soma as a twig, which is much like Ephedra sinica when it is dried out.

<text>Lew Brown (born Louis Brownstein; December 10, 1893 – February 5, 1958) was a lyricist for popular songs in the United States. During World War I and the Roaring Twenties, he wrote lyrics for several of the top Tin Pan Alley composers, especially Albert Von Tilzer. Brown was one third of a successful songwriting and music publishing team with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson from 1925 until 1931. Brown also wrote or co-wrote many Broadway shows and Hollywood films. Among his most-popular songs are &quot;Button Up Your Overcoat&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Under the Apple Tree&quot;, &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries&quot;, &quot;That Old Feeling&quot;, and &quot;The Birth of the Blues&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Brown was born December 10, 1893, in Odessa, Russian Empire, part of today&#x27;s Ukraine, the son of Etta (Hirsch) and Jacob Brownstein. His family was Jewish. When he was five, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School but, at the suggestion of a teacher, he left to pursue his songwriting career without graduating.

Lew Brown was married first to Sylvia Fiske, then to Catherine &quot;June&quot; Brown until his death. He had two daughters from his first marriage, Naomi Brown Greif and Arlyne Brown Mulligan. The latter was married to the prominent jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan.

==Career==

Brown started writing for Tin Pan Alley in 1912 and collaborated with established composers, like Albert Von Tilzer. Two of their well-known works that year were &quot;(I&#x27;m Going Back to) Kentucky Sue&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m the Lonesomest Gal in Town&quot;. Brown then wrote a string of popular World War I songs during 1914–1918, teaming with Von Tilzer, Al Harriman, and other composers.

In 1925, Brown formed his most-successful songwriting partnership with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson. Their cheerful hits, such as &quot;Button Up Your Overcoat&quot; and &quot;The Birth of the Blues&quot;, earned lasting appreciation for &quot;the rich variety of verbal mosaics&quot; and &quot;the suggestive imagery that was their trademark&quot;. DeSylva left in 1931 but Brown and Henderson continued scoring Broadway shows. Brown also worked with other composers, like Sammy Fain. &quot;Brown in 1939 estimated that he had written or collaborated on about 7,000 songs.&quot;

Brown wrote the lyrics to &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Under the Apple Tree&quot; (1942), which appeared in the film &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot;. Recordings by Glenn Miller and by the Andrews Sisters popularized the song with World War II soldiers and radio audiences. Not long after this hit, Brown retired from songwriting.

===Honors and awards===
Brown and Fain&#x27;s &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; (1937) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Under the Apple Tree&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Von Tilzer, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson were all included in the inaugural class of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

===Biographical film===
The DeSylva, Brown and Henderson songwriting team was the subject of the 1956 musical biopic: &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free,&quot; produced by the Ephrons and based on a storyline by John O&#x27;Hara, who would have met and known them in twenties New York. Brown, who was still living when the film came out, was portrayed somewhat unflatteringly as being the most pugnacious and flawed of the trio by lookalike Ernest Borgnine.

==Death==
Brown died of a heart attack at home in New York City on February 5, 1958.

<text>The Difference Engine (1990) is an alternative history novel by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. It is widely regarded as a book that helped establish the genre conventions of steampunk.

It posits a Victorian-era Britain in which great technological and social change has occurred after entrepreneurial inventor Charles Babbage succeeded in his ambition to build mechanical computers.

The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 1990, the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991, and both the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Prix Aurora Award in 1992.

== Setting ==
The novel is chiefly set in 1855. The fictional historical background diverges from our timeline around 1824, at which point Charles Babbage completes his difference engine and proceeds to develop an Analytical Engine. He becomes politically powerful and at the 1830 general election successfully opposes the Tory Government of the Duke of Wellington. Although Wellington stages a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1830 in an attempt to overturn his defeat and prevent the acceleration of technological change and social upheaval, he is assassinated in 1831. The Industrial Radical Party, led by a Lord Byron who survives the Greek War of Independence, comes to power. The Tory Party and hereditary peerage are eclipsed, and British trade unions assist in the ascendancy of the Industrial Radical Party (much as they aided the Labour Party of Great Britain in the twentieth century in our own world). As a result, Luddite anti-technological working class revolutionaries are ruthlessly suppressed.

By 1855, the Babbage computers have become mass-produced and ubiquitous, and their use emulates the innovations that actually occurred during our information technology and Internet revolutions. Other steam-powered technologies have also developed and so, for example, Gurney steam carriages become increasingly common. The novel explores the social consequences of an information technology revolution in the nineteenth century, such as the emergence of &quot;clackers&quot; (a reference to hackers), technologically-proficient people, such as Théophile Gautier, who are skilled at programming the Engines through the use of punched cards.

In the novel, the British Empire is more powerful than in our reality because of the development and the use of extremely-advanced steam-driven technology in industry. In addition, similar military technology has enhanced the capabilities of the armed forces (airships, dreadnoughts, and artillery) and the Babbage computers themselves. Under the Industrial Radical Party, Britain shows the utmost respect for leading scientific and industrial figures such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin. Indeed, they are collectively called &quot;savants&quot; and often raised to the peerage on their merits, causing a break with the past as regards social prestige and class distinction. The new patterns are also reflected in the educational sphere: classical studies have lost importance to more practical concerns such as engineering and accountancy.

Britain, rather than the United States, opened Japan to Western trade, in part because the United States became fragmented by interference from a Britain that foresaw the implications of a unified United States on the world stage. Counterpart successor states to our world&#x27;s United States include a (truncated) United States; the Confederate States of America; the Republic of Texas; the Republic of California; a communist Manhattan Island commune (with Karl Marx as a leading light); British North America (analogous to Canada, albeit slightly larger in this world); and Russian America (Alaska). Napoleon III&#x27;s French Empire holds an entente with the British, and Napoleon is even married to a British woman.

In the world of &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, France occupies Mexico, as it did briefly in reality during the American Civil War. Like Great Britain, it has its own analytical/difference engines (&quot;ordinateurs&quot;), especially used in the context of domestic surveillance within its police force and intelligence agencies. As for the other world powers, Germany remains fragmented, with no suggestion that Prussia will eventually form the core of a unified nation, as it did in our own timeline in 1871, which may be caused by French sabotage analogous to that pursued in the case of the fragmentation of the United States noted above. Japan is awakening after the British ended its isolation, and looks, as in our timeline, set to become one of this world&#x27;s leading industrial and economic powers from the 20th century onward.

The intervention of Lords Byron and Babbage provide famine relief with grain confiscated from the landed aristocracy. The Great Famine of Ireland never occurred, there is no agitation for Irish home rule or Irish independence and the Irish instead have become enthusiastic supporters of the Radical regime. A Spanish Civil War is mentioned to be taking place in 1855 with one side being the Royalists, and in 1905, possibly as a result of that conflict, there is an independent Republic of Catalonia.

Among other historical characters, the novel features &quot;Texian&quot; President Sam Houston, as an exile after a political coup in Texas, a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley (as a Luddite), John Keats as a &quot;kinotropist&quot; (an operator of mechanical pixellated screens), and Benjamin Disraeli as a publicist and tabloid writer.

==Plot summary==
The action of the story follows Sybil Gerard, a political courtesan and daughter of an executed Luddite leader; Edward &quot;Leviathan&quot; Mallory, a paleontologist and explorer; and Laurence Oliphant, a historical figure who, as is portrayed in the book, was a travel writer whose work was a cover for espionage activities &quot;undertaken in the service of Her Majesty&quot;. Linking all their stories is the trail of a mysterious set of reportedly very powerful computer punch cards and the individuals fighting to obtain them.

Many characters come to believe that the punch cards are a gambling &quot;modus&quot;, a programme that would allow the user to place consistently winning bets. The last chapter reveals that the punched cards represent a program that proves two theorems, which, in reality, would not be discovered until 1931 by Kurt Gödel. Ada Lovelace delivers a lecture on the subject in France.

Defending the cards, Mallory gathers his brothers and Ebenezer Fraser, a secret police officer, to fight the revolutionary Captain Swing, who leads a London riot during &quot;the Stink&quot;, a major episode of pollution in which London swelters under an inversion layer (comparable to the London Smog of December 1952).

After the abortive uprising, Oliphant and Sybil Gerard meet at a cafe in Paris. Oliphant informs her that he is aware of her true identity but will not pursue it. However, he wants information that would compromise her seducer, Charles Egremont MP, now regarded as an obstacle to the strategies and political ambitions of Lords Brunel and Babbage. Sybil has longed for an opportunity for vengeance against Egremont, and the resultant political scandal destroys his parliamentary career and aspirations for a merit lordship. Oliphant also encounters a Manhattan-based group of feminist pantomime artists.

After several vignettes that elaborate on the alternate historical origins of the world of &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, Lovelace delivers her lecture on Gödel&#x27;s Theorem, as its counterpart is known in our world. She is chaperoned by Fraser and castigated by Sybil Gerard, who is still unable to forgive Ada&#x27;s father, the late Lord Byron, for his role in her own father&#x27;s death.

At the very end of the novel is a depiction of an alternate 1991 from the vantage point of a computer, which is revealed to be the narrator as it achieves self-awareness.

==Characters==
* The character Michael Godwin was named after attorney Mike Godwin to thank for his technical assistance in linking Sterling and Gibson&#x27;s computers, which allowed them to collaborate between Austin and Vancouver.
* The characters of Sybil Gerard; her father, Walter Gerard; Charles Egremont; and Dandy Mick are all borrowed from Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s novel &quot;Sybil&quot;

== Literary criticism and significance ==
The novel has attracted the attention of scholars, including Jay Clayton, who explores the book&#x27;s attitude toward hacking, as well as its treatment of Babbage and Ada Lovelace; Herbert Sussman, who demonstrates how the book rewrites Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s novel &quot;Sybil&quot;; and Brian McHale, who relates it to the postmodern interest in finding a &quot;new way of &#x27;doing&#x27; history in fiction.&quot;

The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 1990, the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991, and both the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Prix Aurora Award in 1992.

==Influence==
The 1993 video game &quot;The Chaos Engine&quot; (released as &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; in the USA) was based on &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;.

<doc id="245886" wikidata="Q405487" url="?curid=245886" title="Macanese people">
<text>The Macanese people (, ) are a multiracial East Asian ethnic group that originated in Macau in the 16th century, consisting of people of predominantly mixed Cantonese and Portuguese as well as Malay, Japanese, English, Dutch, Sinhalese, and Indian ancestry.

After World War II, many Macanese migrated out of Macau and dispersed all over the globe, causing their history and culture to become at risk of being lost.

==Name==
In Cantonese, the lingua franca of Macau, the terms and refer to the Macau people and the Macanese people, respectively. Although there were attempts by the colonial government during the mid-1990s to redefine the term &quot;Macanese&quot; as simply meaning a permanent resident, or as referring to anyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity in accordance with Cantonese usage in, this did not succeed. Consequently, the term &quot;Macanese&quot; is neither a term referring to the indigenous Tanka people of Macau, nor simply the demonym of Macau, but it instead refers to a specific minority ethnic group comprising approximately 1.2% of Macau&#x27;s population. Due to the rise of localism among Macau people, following the 1999 handover &quot;Macanese&quot; is properly used to refer to people that were born in or live in Macau.

==Culture==

Modern Macanese culture can be best described as a Sino-Latin culture. Historically, many ethnic Macanese spoke Patuá, which is a Portuguese-based creole and now nearly extinct. Many are fluent in both Portuguese and Cantonese. The Macanese have preserved a distinctive Macanese cuisine.

== History ==
===Portuguese colonial period===

Macau was founded circa 1557 by Portuguese merchants with permission of the Chinese Canton governor and later the emperor. Since its beginning, Macau has not been conquered and until the attacks of the Dutch in 1604, it didn&#x27;t have a military garrison. Portuguese culture dominates the Macanese, but Chinese cultural patterns are also significant. The community acted as the interface between Portuguese merchant settlers or ruling colonial government – Portuguese who knew little about the Chinese – and the Chinese majority (90% of population) who knew equally little about the Portuguese. Some were Portuguese men stationed in Macau as part of their military service. Many stayed in Macau after the expiration of their military service, marrying Macanese women.

Rarely did Chinese women marry Portuguese; initially, mostly Goans, Ceylonese/Sinhalese (from Sri Lanka), Indochina, Malay (from Malacca), and Japanese women were the wives of the Portuguese men in Macau. Slave women of Indian, Indonesian, Malay, and Japanese origin were used as partners by Portuguese men. Japanese girls would be purchased in Japan by Portuguese men. Macau received an influx of African slaves, Japanese slaves as well as Christian Korean slaves who were bought by the Portuguese from the Japanese after they were taken prisoner during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) in the era of Hideyoshi. From 1555 onwards, Macau received slave women of Timorese origin as well as women of African origin, and from Malacca and India. Macau was permitted by Pombal to receive an influx of Timorese women. Many Chinese became Macanese simply by converting to Catholicism, and they had no ancestry from the Portuguese, having assimilated into the Macanese people since they were rejected by non-Christian Chinese. The majority of marriages between Portuguese and natives were between Portuguese men and women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors. Western men like the Portuguese were refused by high class Chinese women, who did not marry foreigners. Literature in Macau was written about love affairs and marriage between the Tanka women and Portuguese men, like &quot;A-Chan, A Tancareira&quot;, by Henrique de Senna Fernandes. More of the stories of Christianized Chinese who adopted Portuguese customs will be narrated on the 3rd paragraph. Furthermore, in the midst of the Manila Galleon trade, a small number of Latinos settled in the ports of Macau in China and Ternate in Indonesia which were secondary connecting trade nodes to the primary trade-route between Manila, Philippines and Acapulco, Mexico; they intermarried with the Portuguese settlers and various Asian settlers; the first Latin American Asians were mostly Mexicans and to a lesser extent, Colombians and Peruvians who made their way to Asia (mainly the Philippines) in the 16th century, the Latin-Americans who were sent to the Philippines and Macau from the Spanish colonies in America were often made up of Mulattoes, Mestizos and Indios (Amerindians). Following the Shimabara Rebellion in 1638, about 400 Japanese Christians were officially deported to Macau or to the Spanish Philippines, and thousands more were pressured into voluntary exile. Among those Japanese Catholic refugees, many were fluent in Portuguese, even intermarried with Portuguese settlers &amp; already existing Macanese settlers.

Much of the business conducted with foreign men in Vietnam was done by the local Vietnamese women, who engaged in both sexual and mercantile intercourse with foreign male traders. A Portuguese and Malay-speaking Vietnamese woman who lived in Macao for an extensive period of time was the person who interpreted for the first diplomatic meeting between Cochin-China and a Dutch delegation. She served as an interpreter for three decades in the Cochin-China court with an old woman who had been married to three husbands, one Vietnamese and two Portuguese. The cosmopolitan exchange was facilitated by the marriage of Vietnamese women to Portuguese merchants. Those Vietnamese women were married to Portuguese men and lived in Macao which is how they became fluent in Malay and Portuguese.
During the late-nineteenth century, and increasingly during Salazar&#x27;s fascist Estado Novo regime, the upbringing of most Macanese fell along the lines of the continental Portuguese – attending Portuguese schools, participating in mandatory military service (some fought in Africa) and practising the Catholic faith. As recently as the 1980s, most Macanese had not received formal Chinese schooling and, hence, could speak but not read or write Chinese. Spoken Cantonese was largely familiar, and some spoke the language with a regional accent (鄉下話) – acquired largely from their mothers or amahs.

Since Portuguese settlement in Macau – dating from 1557 – included a strong Catholic presence, a number of Chinese converted to Catholicism. A large number of Macanese can trace their roots to these New Christians. Many of these Chinese were assimilated into the Macanese community, dropping their Chinese surnames and adopting Portuguese surnames. In the collective Macanese folk memory, there is a little ditty about the parish of St. Lazarus Parish, called 進教圍, where these Chinese converts lived: 進教圍, 割辮仔, 唔係姓念珠 (Rosário)　就係姓玫瑰 (Rosa). Hence, it is surmised that many Macanese with surnames of Rosario or Rosa probably were of Chinese ancestry. Because of this, there are many Eurasians carrying Portuguese surnames Rosario, Rosa, and others that are not Portuguese-blooded may be mistaken by others as Portuguese-blooded, and Eurasians of Portuguese blood carrying Portuguese surnames trace their Portuguese blood on their maternal side. A visit to the St Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Cemitério São Miguel Arcanjo), the main Catholic cemetery near the St. Lazarus Parish, would reveal gravestones with a whole spectrum of Chinese and Portuguese heritage: Chinese with Portuguese baptised names with or without Portuguese surnames, Portuguese married with Chinese Catholics, and so on.

The mid-twentieth century, with the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the Macanese population surge through the re-integration of two disparate Macanese communities: the Hong Kong Macanese and the Shanghai Macanese. With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Macanese population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These Macanese, including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the Macanese community is the 上海葡僑; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the &quot;Paris of the Orient&quot;. They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the communist forces. Many spoke little Portuguese and were several generations removed from Portugal, speaking primarily English and Shanghainese, and/or Mandarin. The Shanghai Macanese carved a niche by teaching English in Macau. Only the children and grandchildren of Shanghainese settlers who were born and raised in Macau have the ability to speak Portuguese.

A number of Macanese also emigrated during the Carnation Revolution and Macau&#x27;s handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, respectively. Most potential emigrants looked to Brazil, Portugal&#x27;s African territories, and Australia.

===Post-colonial period ===
Beginning with the post-1974 independence of other Portuguese colonies and hastened by Macau&#x27;s return to China, the Macanese community began to lose its Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese, Eurasians and Chinese who were loyal to the Portuguese left after its return to China. Of those that remained, many children – including those of pure Chinese descent – switched from Portuguese- to English-medium high school education, particularly as many of parents recognised the diminishing value of Portuguese schooling. Many Macanese people of mixed ancestry since Portuguese time never speak Portuguese and speak only Cantonese as their first language; if other Macanese people of mixed ancestry speak Portuguese, they speak it as a second language, affected by a Cantonese accent. At the same time, Macanese of pure Portuguese descent are also learning Cantonese and Mandarin to be able to communicate to non-Portuguese-speaking Chinese. Today, most Macanese – if they are still young enough – would go back to study to read and write Chinese. Many see a niche role for fluent speakers of Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin. Code-switching between Portuguese, Cantonese, and Mandarin among native speakers is common. In the 1980s, Macanese or Portuguese women began to marry men who identified themselves as Chinese.

== Macanese identity dispute ==
There is some dispute around the exact meaning of &quot;Macanese&quot;. An essay by Marreiros offers a broad spectrum of &quot;Macanese types&quot;, ranging from Chinese Christian converts who live among the Portuguese to the descendants of old-established families of Portuguese lineage; all groups are integrated into this historically legitimated group. As a general rule, it is not a point of reference, however for ethnic Chinese living and raised in Macau; they often identify themselves as Chinese or Chinese from Macau; &quot;Macanese&quot; is applied to those people who have been acculturated through Western education and religion and are recognized by the Macanese community as being Macanese.

Traditionally, the basis for Macanese ethnic affiliation has been the use of the Portuguese language at home or some alliances with Portuguese cultural patterns and not solely determined along hereditary lines. Pina-Cabral and Lourenço suggest that this goal is reached &quot;namely through the Portuguese-language school-system&quot;. Often, due to the close proximity to the Portuguese, the Macanese closely identify themselves with Portuguese nationals as opposed to Chinese in the bi-cultural and bi-racial equation. In practice, however, being Macanese is left up to how individuals categorize themselves.

In the mid-1990s, there had been attempts by the Macau government to redefine the Macanese to be everyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language or nationality. Since the re-integration of Macau with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in late 1999, the traditional definitions are in a state of re-formulation. Given the shifting political climate of Macau, some Macanese are coming to recognize and identify closer with a Chinese heritage.

This ambiguity might be reduced by the further adjective crioulo.

<doc id="245903" wikidata="Q1351288" url="?curid=245903" title="USS Intrepid (CV-11)">
<text>USS &quot;Intrepid&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-11), also known as The Fighting &quot;I&quot;, is one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. She is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in August 1943, &quot;Intrepid&quot; participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, including the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, but also participated in the Vietnam War. She was the recovery ship for a Mercury and a Gemini space mission. Because of her prominent role in battle, she was nicknamed &quot;the Fighting I&quot;, while her frequent bad luck and time spent in dry dock for repairs—she was torpedoed once and hit in separate attacks by four Japanese kamikaze aircraft—earned her the nicknames &quot;Decrepit&quot; and &quot;the Dry I&quot;.

Decommissioned for the second time in 1974, she was put into service as a museum ship in 1982 as the foundation of the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum Complex in New York City.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Intrepid&quot; was laid down on 1 December 1941 in Shipway 10 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II. She was launched on 26 April 1943, the fifth to be launched. She was sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral John H. Hoover. On 16 August 1943, she was commissioned with Captain Thomas L. Sprague in command before heading to the Caribbean for shakedown and training. She thereafter returned to Norfolk, before departing once more on 3 December, bound for San Francisco. She proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving there on 10 January, where she began preparations to join the rest of the Pacific Fleet for offensive operations against the Imperial Japanese Navy.

===World War II===
====Central Pacific operations====

&quot;Intrepid&quot; joined the Fast Carrier Task Force, then Task Force 58 (TF 58), for the next operation in the island-hopping campaign across the Central Pacific: the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. On 16 January 1944, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, her sister ship , and the light carrier left Pearl Harbor to conduct a raid on islands in the Kwajalein Atoll from 29 January to 2 February. The three carriers&#x27; air group destroyed all 83 Japanese aircraft stationed on Roi-Namur in the first two days of the strikes, before Marines went ashore on neighboring islands on 31 January in the Battle of Kwajalein. That morning, aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot; attacked Japanese beach defenses on Ennuebing Island until ten minutes before the first Marines landed. The Marines quickly took the island and used it as a fire base to support the follow-on attack on Roi.

After the fighting in the Kwajalein Atoll finished, on 3 February, &quot;Intrepid&quot; and the rest of TF 58 proceeded to launch Operation Hailstone, a major raid on the main Japanese naval base in the Central Pacific, Truk Lagoon. From 17 to 19 February, the carriers pounded Japanese forces in the lagoon, sinking two destroyers and some of merchant ships. The strikes demonstrated the vulnerability of Truk, which convinced the Japanese to avoid using it in the future. &quot;Intrepid&quot; did not emerge from the operation unscathed, however; on the night of 17–18 February, a &quot;Rikko&quot; type Torpedo Bomber from the 755th &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; (Genzan Air Group) flying from Tainan (given the designation &quot;Raid Easy&quot; by &quot;Intrepid&#x27;s&quot; CIC) attacked and torpedoed the carrier near her stern. The torpedo struck below the waterline, jamming the ship&#x27;s rudder to port and flooding several compartments. Sprague was able to counteract the jammed rudder for two days by running the port side screw at high speed while idling the starboard screw, until high winds overpowered the improvised steering. The crew then jury-rigged a sail out of scrap canvas and hatch covers, which allowed the ship to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 24 February. Temporary repairs were effected there, after which &quot;Intrepid&quot; steamed on 16 March, escorted by the destroyer USS Remey, to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for permanent repairs, arriving there six days later.

The work was completed by 9 June, and &quot;Intrepid&quot; began two months of training around Pearl Harbor. Starting in early September, &quot;Intrepid&quot; joined operations in the western Caroline Islands; the Fast Carrier Task Force was now part of the Third Fleet under Admiral William Halsey Jr., and had been renamed Task Force 38. On 6 and 7 September, she conducted air strikes on Japanese artillery batteries and airfields on the island of Peleliu, in preparation for the invasion of Peleliu. On 9 and 10 September, she and the rest of the fleet moved on to attack airfields on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, followed by further strikes on bases in the Visayan Sea between 12 and 14 September. On 17 September, &quot;Intrepid&quot; returned to Pelelieu to provide air support to the Marines that had landed on the island two days before.

====Philippines campaign====
&quot;Intrepid&quot; and the other carriers then returned to the Philippines to prepare for the Philippines campaign. At this time, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was assigned to Task Group 38.2. In addition to targets in the Philippines themselves, the carriers also struck Japanese airfields on the islands of Formosa and Okinawa to degrade Japanese air power in the region. On 20 October, at the start of the Battle of Leyte, &quot;Intrepid&quot; launched strikes to support Allied forces as they went ashore on the island of Leyte. By this time Halsey had reduced the carriers of TG 38.2, commanded by Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan aboard &quot;Intrepid&quot;, to just &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot;, and the light carrier .

Between 23 and 26 October, the Japanese Navy launched a major operation to disrupt the Allied landings in the Philippines, resulting in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On the morning of 24 October, a reconnaissance aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot; spotted Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s flagship, . Two hours later, &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Cabot&quot; launched a strike on Kurita&#x27;s Center Force, initiating the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea; this included eight Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, which launched their attack at 10:27. One bomb struck the roof of Turret No. 1, failing to penetrate. Two minutes later, the battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; was struck starboard amidships by a torpedo from a Grumman TBF Avenger, also from &quot;Intrepid&quot;. The Japanese shot down two Avengers. Another eight Helldivers from &quot;Intrepid&quot; attacked &quot;Musashi&quot; again at around noon, scoring two more hits, with two Helldivers shot down. Three minutes later, nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship, scoring three torpedo hits on the port side. Further strikes from &quot;Essex&quot; and inflicted several more bomb and torpedo hits at around 13:30. At 15:25, 37 aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, the fleet carrier , and &quot;Cabot&quot; attacked &quot;Musashi&quot;, hitting her with 13 bombs and 11 torpedoes for the loss of three Avengers and three Helldivers. In addition to the loss of &quot;Musashi&quot;, many of Kurita&#x27;s other ships, including battleships &quot;Yamato&quot;, and , and heavy cruiser were damaged in the attacks, forcing him to break off the operation temporarily.

After Kurita&#x27;s force began to withdraw, Halsey ordered TF 38 to steam north to intercept the aircraft carriers of the Northern Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa. Bogan correctly perceived that Ozawa&#x27;s force was intended to lure TF 38 away from the landing area to allow Kurita to attack it, but Halsey overruled him and several other Task Group commanders who voiced similar concerns. Early on 25 October, aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot; and the other carriers launched a strike on the Japanese carriers. Aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot; scored hits on the carrier and possibly the carrier . Further strikes throughout the morning resulted in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers and a destroyer in the Battle off Cape Engaño. Halsey&#x27;s preoccupation with the Northern Force allowed Kurita the respite he needed to turn his force back to the east, push through the San Bernardino Strait, where it engaged the light forces of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts that were directly covering the landing force in the Battle off Samar. Kurita nevertheless failed to break through the American formation, and ultimately broke off the attack.

On 27 October, TG 38.2 returned to operations over Luzon; these included a raid on Manila on 29 October. That day, a kamikaze suicide aircraft hit &quot;Intrepid&quot; on one of her port side gun positions; ten men were killed and another six were wounded, but damage was minimal. A Japanese air raid on 25 November struck the fleet shortly after noon. Two kamikazes crashed into &quot;Intrepid&quot;, killing sixty-nine men and causing a serious fire. The ship remained on station, however, and the fires were extinguished within two hours. She was detached for repairs the following day, and reached San Francisco on 20 December.

====Okinawa and Japan, March–December 1945====
In the middle of February 1945, back in fighting trim, the carrier steamed for Ulithi, arriving on 13 March. She set off westward for strikes on Japan on 14 March and four days later launched strikes against airfields on Kyūshū. That morning a twin-engined Japanese G4M &quot;Betty&quot; kamikaze broke through a curtain of defensive fire, turned toward &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and exploded 50 ft (15 m) off &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s forward boat crane. A shower of flaming gasoline and aircraft parts started fires on the hangar deck, but damage control teams quickly put them out. &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s aircraft joined attacks on remnants of the Japanese fleet anchored at Kure damaging 18 enemy naval vessels, including battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; and carrier . The carriers turned to Okinawa as L-Day, the start of the most ambitious amphibious assault of the Pacific war, approached. Between 26 and 27 March, their aircraft attacked the Ryūkyūs, softening up enemy defensive works. The invasion began on 1 April. &quot;Intrepid&quot; aircraft flew support missions against targets on Okinawa and made neutralizing raids against Japanese airfields in range of the island. On 16 April, during an air raid, a Japanese aircraft dived into &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s flight deck; the engine and part of the fuselage penetrated the deck, killing eight men and wounding 21. In less than an hour the flaming gasoline had been extinguished; three hours after the crash, aircraft were again landing on the carrier.

On 17 April, &quot;Intrepid&quot; retired homeward via Ulithi. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor on 11 May, arriving at San Francisco for repairs on 19 May. On 29 June, the carrier left San Francisco. On 6 August, her aircraft launched strikes against Japanese on bypassed Wake Island. &quot;Intrepid&quot; arrived at Eniwetok on the next day. On 15 August, when the Japanese surrendered, she received word to &quot;cease offensive operations.&quot; &quot;Intrepid&quot; got under way on 21 August to support the occupation of Japan. On 2 December, she left Yokosuka and arrived at San Pedro, California, on 15 December.

===Post-war===
====Decommissioning and conversion to attack carrier====

On 4 February 1946, &quot;Intrepid&quot; moved to San Francisco Bay. The carrier was reduced in status to &quot;commission in reserve&quot; on 15 August, and she was decommissioned on 22 March 1947. After her decommissioning, &quot;Intrepid&quot; became part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 9 February 1952, she was recommissioned and on 12 March began the voyage to Norfolk, where the carrier received SCB-27C modernization to operate jet aircraft as an attack aircraft carrier. On 9 April, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was temporarily decommissioned for the modernization at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. On 1 October, she was reclassified as attack carrier CVA-11 and recommissioned in reserve on 18 June 1954. On 13 October, the carrier became the first to launch aircraft with American-built steam catapults. Two days later, &quot;Intrepid&quot; became part of the Atlantic Fleet in full commission.

====1955–1961====

In 1955, &quot;Intrepid&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise out of Guantánamo Bay. On 28 May, she departed Mayport, Florida, for the first of two deployments in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. &quot;Intrepid&quot; returned to Norfolk from the second deployment on 5 September. On 29 September, she entered the New York Navy Yard for her SCB-125 modernization, which added an enclosed bow and an angled flight deck. After the end of the modernization in April 1957, &quot;Intrepid&quot; conducted refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay. In September, she participated in Operation Strikeback, the largest peacetime naval exercise up to that time in history, which simulated a Soviet attack on NATO. In December, operating from Norfolk, she conducted Operation Crosswind, a study of the effects of wind on carrier launches. The study proved that carriers could safely conduct flight operations without turning into the wind and even launch aircraft while steaming downwind. Between 1958 and 1961, &quot;Intrepid&quot; alternated Mediterranean deployments with operations along the Atlantic coast of the United States and exercises in the Caribbean.

====1962–1965====
&quot;Intrepid&quot; was reclassified to an anti-submarine warfare carrier, CVS-11, on 8 December 1961. On 10 March 1962, the carrier entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul and refit for her new anti-submarine warfare role. After the completion of the overhaul and refit, she departed on 2 April with Carrier Antisubmarine Air Group 56 embarked. After training exercises, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was selected as the principal ship in the recovery team for astronaut Scott Carpenter and his Project Mercury space capsule, &quot;Aurora 7&quot;. Shortly before noon on 24 May 1962, Carpenter splashed down in &quot;Aurora 7&quot; northeast of Puerto Rico and several hundred miles from &quot;Intrepid&quot;. Minutes after he was located by land-based search aircraft, two helicopters from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, carrying NASA officials, medical experts, Navy frogmen, and photographers, were airborne and headed to the rescue. One of the helicopters picked him up over an hour later and flew him to the carrier, which safely returned him to the United States. &quot;Intrepid&quot; spent the summer of 1962 training midshipmen at sea, and received a thorough overhaul at Norfolk in the fall.

On 23 January 1963, the carrier departed Hampton Roads for warfare exercises in the Caribbean. In late February, she interrupted these operations to join a sea hunt for the Venezuelan freighter &quot;Anzoátegui&quot;, which had been hijacked by a group of pro-Castro mutineers led by the second mate. After the mutineers had surrendered at Rio de Janeiro, the carrier returned to Norfolk on 23 March. &quot;Intrepid&quot; operated along the Atlantic Coast for the next year from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean perfecting her antisubmarine techniques. On 11 June 1964, she left Norfolk carrying midshipmen to the Mediterranean for a hunter-killer at sea training with the 6th Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, &quot;Intrepid&quot; aided in the surveillance of a Soviet task group. En route home her crew learned that she had won the coveted Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for antisubmarine warfare during the previous fiscal year. In the fall of 1964, the carrier operated along the East Coast. In early September, &quot;Intrepid&quot; entertained 22 NATO statesmen as part of their tour of U.S. military installations. Between 18 and 19 October 1964, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was at Yorktown for ceremonies commemorating Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender 183 years before. The French Ambassador attended the ceremony and presented the U.S. with 12 cannon cast from molds found in the Bastille, replicas of those brought to American forces by Lafayette.

On the night of 21 November, during a brief deployment off North Carolina, airman Jenner Sanders, who had fallen overboard while driving an aircraft towing tractor, was rescued. In early 1965, &quot;Intrepid&quot; began preparations for a role in NASA&#x27;s first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3. On 23 March, Lieutenant Commander John Young and Major Gus Grissom in &quot;Molly Brown&quot; (the Gemini 3 spacecraft) splashed down some from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, after the first controlled re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere ended their three-orbit flight aboard Gemini 3. A Navy helicopter flew the astronauts to &quot;Intrepid&quot; for medical examination and debriefing. Later, &quot;Intrepid&quot; retrieved &quot;Molly Brown&quot; and returned the spacecraft and astronauts to Cape Kennedy.

====1965–1974====

After this mission &quot;Intrepid&quot; entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard in April for a major overhaul to bring her back to peak combat readiness. This was the final Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization job performed by the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, which was scheduled to close. In September 1965, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, with her work approximately 75% completed, eased down the East River to moor at the Naval Supply Depot at Bayonne, New Jersey, for the completion of her multimillion-dollar overhaul. After builder&#x27;s sea trials and fitting out at Norfolk she sailed to Guantánamo Bay on a shakedown cruise.

From April 1966 to February 1969, &quot;Intrepid&quot; made three Vietnam deployments, with Carrier Air Wing 10 embarked. Mid-1966 found &quot;Intrepid&quot; with the Pacific Fleet off Vietnam. Nine A-4 Skyhawks and six A-1 Skyraiders, loaded with bombs and rockets, were catapulted in seven minutes, with only a 28-second interval between launches. A few days later planes were launched at 26-second intervals. After seven months of service with the United States Seventh Fleet off Vietnam, &quot;Intrepid&quot; returned to Norfolk having earned her commanding officer, Captain John W. Fair, the Legion of Merit for combat operations in Southeast Asia.

On 9 October 1966 Lieutenant, junior grade William T. Patton of VA-176 from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, flying a propeller driven A-1H Skyraider, shot down one MiG-17. For the action, Lieutenant (jg) Patton was awarded the Silver Star.

In June 1967, &quot;Intrepid&quot; returned to the Western Pacific by way of the Suez Canal just before it closed due to the Israeli–Arab crisis. There she began another tour with the Seventh Fleet.

In 1968, &quot;Intrepid&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. For Carrier Air Wing 10&#x27;s final cruise aboard &quot;Intrepid&quot; from 4 June 1968 to 8 February 1969 off Southeast Asia, the wing consisted of VF-111 Detachment 11 (F-8C), VA-106 with the A-4E, VA-66 Waldos (A-4C), VFP-63 Detachment 11 (RF-8G), VA-36 &#x27;Roadrunners&#x27; (A-4C), VAQ-33 Detachment 11 (EA-1F), VAW-121 Detachment 11 (E-1B), and HC-2 Detachment 11.

In 1969, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was home ported at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, relieving as the flagship for Commander Carrier Division 16. In the fall, the ship was run aground by Captain Horus E. Moore, but was freed within two hours. From April to October 1971, &quot;Intrepid&quot; took part in NATO exercises, and made calls in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean ports of Lisbon, Plymouth, Kiel, Naples, Cannes, Barcelona, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Greenock, Rosyth, Portsmouth, and Bergen. During this cruise, submarine detection operations were conducted in the Baltic and at the edge of the Barents Sea above the Arctic Circle, under close scrutiny of Soviet air and naval forces. She subsequently returned to her homeport to be refitted.

Beginning in July 1972, &quot;Intrepid&quot; participated once again in NATO exercises, visiting Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Bergen, Brussels, Portsmouth and Gourock. &quot;Intrepid&quot; found herself in the Barents and made round the clock flight operations as she was above the Arctic Circle. She cut her North Atlantic cruise short, returning to Quonset Point for a mini-overhaul. She made her final cruise in the Mediterranean, stopping twice in Barcelona and Malaga Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Nice, France; Naples, Italy; Palma, Majorca; and Piraeus, Greece once. Due to fuel limitations &quot;Intrepid&quot; spent as much time in port as she did underway.

On 15 March 1974, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was decommissioned for the final time.

==Preservation as museum ship==
In 1976, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was moored at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia and hosted exhibits as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations.
Plans originally called for &quot;Intrepid&quot; to be scrapped after decommissioning, but a campaign led by Michael D. Piccola, president of the nonprofit organization Odysseys in Flight saved the carrier and established her as a museum ship. In August 1982, the ship opened at Pier 86 on the Hudson River in New York City as the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. Four years later, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark.

Over the years &quot;Intrepid&quot; hosted many events including wrestling, press conferences, and parties, and served as the FBI operations center after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.

===2006–2008 renovation===
The &quot;Intrepid&quot; museum operated a fund for the restoration, raising over $60 million to refit &quot;Intrepid&quot;, to improve the ship&#x27;s exhibits for visitors, and improve Pier 86.

In early July 2006, it was announced that &quot;Intrepid&quot; would undergo renovations and repairs, along with Pier 86 itself. The museum closed on 1 October 2006, in preparation for &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s being towed to Bayonne, New Jersey, for repairs, and later Staten Island, New York, for renovation and temporary docking.

On 6 November 2006 the aircraft carrier could not be moved due to 24 years worth of accumulated silt; a $3 million program dredged away the mud and silt over three weeks. On 5 December 2006 &quot;Intrepid&quot; was removed from her pier and towed to Bayonne.

At Staten Island, &quot;Intrepid&quot; received an $8 million interior renovation. The forecastle (fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship&#x27;s machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck layout and design were improved. Around 1,200 tons of steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings long were installed. of paint were used to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120 million—$55 million for the ship and $65 million for Pier 86.

The carrier was towed back into place on the Hudson River on 2 October 2008 and reopened to the public on 8 November.

===Since 2008===

On 12 December 2011, ownership of the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; was officially transferred to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in New York City. On 27 April 2012 &quot;Enterprise&quot; was flown from Dulles International Airport for a fly-by over the Hudson River, New York&#x27;s JFK International Airport, the Statue of Liberty, the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, and several other landmarks in the city in an approximately 45-minute &quot;final tour&quot;, landing at JFK International Airport.
The shuttle was returned by barge to Hangar 1 on 12 May 2012 and taken to the Intrepid Museum in Manhattan on 6 June.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; went on public display on 19 July 2012, at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum&#x27;s new Space Shuttle Pavilion.

<text>Salter Street Films was a Canadian television and film production company based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

==History==
Salter Street Films was founded by brothers Paul and Michael Donovan in 1983. Paul was trained as a director at the London Film School; Michael graduated from Dalhousie University’s Law School and started as a producer of Paul&#x27;s film projects. Salter Street Films was named after the street in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Paul and Michael had been living.

The company started life with early problems. Its first major feature film was &quot;Def-Con 4&quot; (1985), which eventually became profitable, but other films such as &quot;George&#x27;s Island&quot; (1989), &quot;Buried on Sunday&quot; (1992), and &quot;Paint Cans&quot; (1994), though critically acclaimed, were money-losers. The company&#x27;s salvation turned out to be the sci-fi TV series &quot;Lexx&quot;, which was a hit in Germany, Russia, and Eastern Europe. This Canadian-German co-production went on to become a lucrative money-maker through international sales and was one of the first shows to develop a cult following almost exclusively through online.

Concurrently, the Donovan brothers found success with the satirical &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; becoming a hit on CBC Television as well as other TV series such as &quot;CODCO&quot;, &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, &quot;Blackfly&quot;, children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Pirates&quot;, and a TV special &quot;Talking to Americans&quot;. These shows found homes on the CBC as well as other Canadian networks and cable channels. Salter Street also created the stop motion-animated preschool TV series &quot;Poko&quot;, which is still in production. In 1994, it has a 20% interest in The Popcorn Channel, which was rumoured to be on the air in the first quarter of 1995. In the 1990s, it meant to mine European co-production with four telefilms, which were planning on to be in production in 1995.

Based on their reputation for political satire, U.S. documentary filmmaker Michael Moore approached Salter Street to produce his project &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;. Michael Donovan agreed and arranged financing in Canada and Germany. The documentary won both the Anniversary Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature Film.

In 2000, a year after the Donovan brothers had taken the company public, Salter Street was awarded the broadcast license for IFC by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. This potentially lucrative award, combined with Salter Street&#x27;s reputation as a content-provider, attracted interest from the powerful media corporation Alliance Atlantis. Alliance bought Salter Street from the majority shareholders the following year. Paul and Michael Donovan remained on as producers.

In 2003, two years after the purchase, Alliance closed the operation, transferring Salter Street&#x27;s ongoing TV productions to Alliance.
Paul Donovan has continued as an independent producer and director. In May 2004, Michael Donovan formed the Halifax Film Company with all of the former Salter Street employees. In 2006, Halifax Film merged with Decode Entertainment to form DHX Media (now as WildBrain). DHX sold the studio in 2018 to IoM Media Ventures and was rebranded to the Island of Misfits.
