<text>The African Reference Alphabet is a largely defunct continent-wide guideline for the creation of Latin alphabets for African languages. Two variants of the initial proposal (one in English and a second in French) were made at a 1978 UNESCO-organized conference held in Niamey, Niger. They were based on the results of several earlier conferences on the harmonization of established Latin alphabets of individual languages. The 1978 conference recommended the use of single letters for speech sounds rather than of letter sequences or of letters with diacritics. A substantial overhaul was proposed in 1982 but was rejected in a follow-up conference held in Niamey in 1984. Since then, continent-wide harmonization has been largely abandoned, because regional needs, practices and thus preferences differ greatly across Africa.

Through the individual languages that were its basis, the African Reference Alphabet inherits from the Africa Alphabet, and like the latter uses a number of IPA letters. The Niamey conference built on the work of a previous UNESCO-organized meeting, on harmonizing the transcriptions of African languages, that was held in Bamako, Mali, in 1966.

==1978 proposals==
Separate versions of the conference&#x27;s report were produced in English and French. Different images of the alphabet were used in the two versions, and there are a number of differences between the two.

The English version was a set of 57 letters, given in both upper-case and lower-case forms. Eight of these are formed from common Latin letters with the addition of an underline mark. Some (the uppercase letters alpha, eth (), esh, and both lower- and upper-case , ) cannot be accurately represented in Unicode (as of version 15, 2023). Others do not correspond to the upper- and lower-case identities in Unicode, or (e.g. Ʒ) require character variants in the font.

This version also listed eight diacritical marks (acute accent (´), grave accent (`), circumflex (ˆ), caron (ˇ), macron (¯), tilde (˜), trema (¨), and a superscript dot (˙) and nine punctuation marks (? ! ( ) « » , ; .).

The letters presented in the Annex 1 of the 1978 Niamey meeting report are slightly different from the ones presented on page 34 (page 32 in the French version) which omitted the hooktop-z but included two apostrophe-like letters (for ʔ and ʕ). Five of the letters were written with a subscript dot instead of a subscript dash as in the English version (ḍ ḥ ṣ ṭ and ẓ). The French and English sets are otherwise identical.



Notes:

* Ɑ/ɑ is &quot;Latin alpha&quot; () not &quot;Latin script a&quot; (). In Unicode, Latin alpha and are not considered as separate characters.
* The upper case I, the counterpart of the lower case i, does not have crossbars () while the upper case counterpart of the lower case ɪ has them ().
* The letter &quot;Z with tophook&quot; () is not included in Unicode.
*c̠, q̠, x̠ represent click consonants (ǀ, ǃ, ǁ respectively), but the line under is optional, and usually not used.
*The pharyngeal ḥ and pharyngealized ḍ, ṣ, ṭ, ẓ are presented with lines below as h̠ and d̠, s̱, t̠, z̠ in the Annex 1 but with dots in the other parts of the 1978 Niamey meeting report (both in the French and English versions) These represent Arabic-style emphatic consonants.
*c, j represent either palatal stops or postalveolar affricates. ɖ, ʈ are the retroflex stops, as in the IPA.
*ƒ, ʋ represent bilabial fricatives.
*ө is a dental fricative, not a vowel.
*Although digraphs using h are normally used to represent aspirated consonants, in languages in which those are absent, the digraphs can be used instead of ʒ, ʃ, ө, ɣ...
*Digraphs with m or n are used for prenasalized consonants, with w and y for labialized and palatalized consonants; kp and gb are used for labial-velar stops; hl and dl are used for lateral fricatives.
*ɓ, ɗ are used for implosives, and ƭ, ƙ for either ejectives or voiceless implosives. ƴ is used for [ʔʲ].
*Nasalization is either written with a nasal consonant following the vowel, or with a tilde. Tone is indicated using the acute accent, grave accent, caron, macron, and circumflex. Diaeresis is used for centralized vowels, and vowel length is indicated by doubling the vowel.
*Segmentation should be done according to each language&#x27;s own phonology and morphology.

==Rejected 1982 proposal==

A proposed revision of the alphabet was made in 1982 by Michael Mann and David Dalby, who had attended the Niamey conference. It has 60 letters. Digraphs are retained only for vowel length and geminate consonants, and even there they suggest replacements. A key feature of this proposal is that, like the French proposal of 1978, it consists of only lower-case letters, making it unicase. It did not meet with acceptance at the follow-up Niamey meeting in 1984.

The 32nd letter &quot;&quot; is called &quot;linearized tilde&quot;. It is not specifically supported in Unicode (as of version 15, 2023), but can be represented by or . and are written without ascenders (thus esh is a mirror of ; is written with a right-hooking tail, like the retroflex letters in the IPA; and has a top hook to the left, like a squashed . , inspired by the shape of Insular t, is meant to complete the series ejective letters with hook , in practice is used instead.

Because no language has all the consonants, the consonant letters are used for more than one potential value. They can be reassigned when there are conflicts. For instance, ɦ may be a voiceless pharyngeal, a voiced glottal fricative, or even (in the Khoekhoe table) an alveolar nasal click to avoid the digraph ɖɴ.

Where are needed for both values, might be chosen for the labiovelar plosives. 

Where dentals contrast with alveolars, might be chosen for the dentals.

Where there are aspirated plosives but not voiced, the pinyin solution might be chosen of using voiced letters (e.g. b) for tenuis and the voiceless letter (e.g. p) for the aspirate. 

Additional affricates should be written with unused letters, or with digraphs in &quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot; where there is morphophonemic justification. 

Where are needed for both values, the lateral fricatives might be written . 

Where velar and uvular fricatives contrast, might be chosen for the uvulars. 

Where is needed for both values, might be chosen for the approximant.

The click letters are combined with ɴ (before or after) for nasal clicks, followed by g for voiced, and followed by h for aspirated.

Remaining diacritics should be replaced by linearized equivalents. For the tone diacritics are proposed baseline-aligned (not supported by Unicode).

<text>The Macintosh II is a family of personal computers that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1987 to 1993. The Macintosh II was the initial model, representing the high-end of the Macintosh line for the time. Over the course of the next six years, seven more models were produced, culminating with the short-lived Macintosh IIvi and Macintosh IIvx models. Apple retired the Macintosh II name when it moved to Motorola 68040 processors; the Centris and Quadra names were used instead.

==Features==
Unlike prior Macintosh models, which are &quot;all-in-one&quot; designs, the Macintosh II models are &quot;modular&quot; systems which do not include built-in monitors and are expandable. Beginning with the Macintosh II and culminating in the Macintosh IIfx, the Macintosh II family was Apple&#x27;s high-end line from 1987 until the introduction of the Motorola 68040-based Macintosh Quadra computers in 1991.

Expansion was provided by way of NuBus, which become the standard expansion bus for the entire Macintosh line for almost a decade. The Macintosh II was the first to officially support color displays, and the first (apart from the Macintosh XL) to support a screen resolution larger than 512x384.

The Macintosh II is also the first to use a Motorola 68000 series processor other than the Motorola 68000. Except for the original Macintosh II which launched the line with a Motorola 68020 clocked at 16 MHz, they exclusively used the Motorola 68030 microprocessor, even after the Motorola 68040 was introduced. Apple would eventually adopt the &#x27;040 with the introduction of the Quadra 700 and 900, positioning these models as high-end workstation-class machines for graphics and scientific computing, while positioning the Macintosh II family as a mainstream desktop computer.

==Legacy==
During the Macintosh II series&#x27; lifespan, they rose to become among the most powerful personal computers available. While the Macintosh II series itself was replaced by the Macintosh Centris and Quadra, the Macintosh LC and Performa families continued to use the II&#x27;s 68030 technology long after the 68040 was introduced and the PowerBook continued to use the &#x27;030 into the Power Macintosh era.

<doc id="243594" wikidata="Q1353232" url="?curid=243594" title="Socialist Party of America">
<text>The Socialist Party of America (SPA) was a socialist political party in the United States formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old Social Democratic Party of America and disaffected elements of the Socialist Labor Party of America who had split from the main organization in 1899.

In the first decades of the 20th century, the SPA drew significant support from many different groups, including trade unionists, progressive social reformers, populist farmers and immigrants. Eugene V. Debs twice won over 900,000 votes in presidential elections (1912 and 1920), while the party also elected two U.S. representatives (Victor L. Berger and Meyer London), dozens of state legislators, more than 100 mayors, and countless lesser officials. The party&#x27;s staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I, although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression, and vigilante persecution. The party was further shattered by a factional war over how to respond to the October Revolution in the Russian Republic in 1917 and the establishment of the Communist International in 1919—many members left the Socialist Party to found Leninist parties including the Communist Party USA.

After endorsing Robert M. La Follette&#x27;s Progressive Party in 1924, the party returned to independent action at the presidential level. It had modest growth in the early 1930s behind presidential candidate Norman Thomas. The party&#x27;s appeal was weakened by the popularity of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, the organization and flexibility of the Communist Party under Earl Browder and the resurgent labor movement&#x27;s desire to support sympathetic Democratic Party politicians. A divisive and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to broaden the party by admitting followers of Leon Trotsky and Jay Lovestone caused the traditional Old Guard to leave and form the Social Democratic Federation. While the party was always strongly anti-fascist as well as anti-Stalinist, its opposition to American entry in World War II cost it both internal and external support.

The party stopped running presidential candidates after 1956, when its nominee, Darlington Hoopes, won fewer than 6,000 votes. In the party&#x27;s last decades, its members, many of them prominent in the labor, peace, civil rights, and civil liberties movements, fundamentally disagreed about the socialist movement&#x27;s relationship to the labor movement and the Democratic Party and about how best to advance democracy abroad. In 1970–1973, these strategic differences became so acute that the SPA changed its name to Social Democrats, USA, both because the term &quot;party&quot; in its name had confused the public and to distance itself from the Soviet Union. Leaders of two of its caucuses formed separate socialist organizations, the Socialist Party USA and the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, the precursor of the Democratic Socialists of America.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

In 1901, the Socialist Party was formed by a merger between the Social Democratic Party of America (headquartered in Chicago, IL) and dissident Lassallean members of the Socialist Labor Party of America, who had also adopted the name Social Democratic Party of America (headquartered in Springfield, MA). The new party chose &quot;socialist&quot; over &quot;social democratic&quot; because the latter lost its meaning when translated from German to English.

From 1901 to the onset of World War I, the Socialist Party had numerous elected officials throughout the United States. There were two Socialist members of Congress, Meyer London of New York City and Victor Berger of Milwaukee (a part of the sewer socialism movement, a major front in socialism, Milwaukee being the first and the only major city to elect a socialist mayor, which it did four times between 1910 and 1956); over 70 mayors; and many state legislators and city councilors. The party was able to successfully run candidates in smaller municipalities as well as big cities, winning the mayoralty of Butte, Montana, with Lewis Duncan and that of Schenectady, New York, with George R. Lunn. Its voting strength was greatest among recent Jewish, Finnish and German immigrants, coal miners and former populist farmers in the Midwest. According to Jimmy Weinstein, its electoral base was strongest west of the Mississippi River, &quot;in the states where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed&quot;. It was also able to attract support from railroad workers. Its vote shares were highest in Oklahoma, Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin, and it also attracted support in Texas, Arkansas and Kansas. From 1900 (before its formal union) to 1912, it ran Eugene V. Debs for president at each election. The best showing ever for a socialist ticket was in 1912, when Debs gained 901,551 total votes, 6% of the popular vote. In 1920, Debs ran again, this time while imprisoned for opposing World War I, and received 913,693 votes, 3.4% of the total.

Early political perspectives ranged from radical socialism to social democracy. Victor Berger and New York party leader Morris Hillquit sat on the party&#x27;s more social democratic or right-wing side. Radical socialists and syndicalists, including Debs and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), sat on the left. There were also agrarian utopian-leaning radicals, such as Julius Wayland of Kansas, who edited the party&#x27;s leading national newspaper, &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, along with trade unionists; Jewish, Finnish and German immigrants; and intellectuals such as Walter Lippmann and the Black activist/intellectual Hubert Harrison. The party outsourced its newspapers and publications so that it would not have an internal editorial board that was a power in its own right. As a result, a handful of outside publishers dominated the published messages the party distributed and agitated for a much more radical anti-capitalist revolutionary message than the party itself tolerated. The &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; newspaper thus became part of its radical left wing as did the Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company of Chicago, which produced over half of the pamphlets and books that were sold at party meetings.

Approaches to agriculture and farmers&#x27; interests were subject to significant debate in the party. While members in most parts of the country advocated collective farming, the Texas and Oklahoma state parties supported populist policies based on small-scale farm ownership, which socialists elsewhere considered economically backward. The populist position was backed by Algie Martin Simons, who argued that small farmers were not being eradicated under capitalist pressure as many socialists believed, but that they were &quot;a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America&quot; and that socialist and labor movements needed to attract their support to advance working-class interests. After disappointing performances in the 1908 elections when it ran on an under-developed agrarian platform based on land collectivization, in 1912 the party adopted a program of reforms including state-backed agricultural cooperatives, socialization of transport, storage and processing facilities, progressive land taxes, and government-supported land leases for small farmers.

Positions in the party on racial segregation varied and were the subject of heated debate from its foundation to the 1919 split. At its founding convention, a resolution was presented in favor of &quot;equal rights for all human beings without distinction of color, race or sex&quot;, specifically highlighting African Americans as particularly oppressed and exploited and calling for them to be organized by the socialist and labor movements. This was opposed by a number of white delegates, who argued that specific appeals to black workers were unnecessary. Two of the black delegates present agreed with this position, but the third, William Costley, held that blacks were in &quot;a distinct and peculiar position in contradiction to other laboring elements in the United States&quot;. Costley introduced his own resolution, which also condemned the campaign of &quot;lynching, burning and disenfranchisement&quot; that black Americans suffered. His resolution passed, albeit with the language on &quot;lynching, burning, and disenfranchisement&quot; removed.

While the resolution enshrined a commitment to opposing racism, sections of the party continued to argue against that. For example, Victor Berger drew on scientific racism to claim that blacks and mulattoes &quot;constitute[d] a lower race&quot;. They were opposed by others who defended the spirit of the resolution, most notably Debs. This spread of opinion was reflected in the drawing up of constitutions by state parties in the South. The Socialist Party of Louisiana initially adopted a &quot;Negro clause&quot; that opposed disenfranchisement of blacks, but it supported segregation. The clause was supported by some Southern socialists and opposed by others, although this was not because of its accommodation of racism as such, but because it officially enshrined this accommodation. The party&#x27;s National Committee persuaded the Louisiana party to withdraw the clause, but when the state party subsequently established segregated branches, the wider party did not object. Segregated locals could also be found in state parties in Texas and elsewhere. When Texas socialists established a Land Renters&#x27; Union in 1911, they initially banned black tenants from joining, before later setting up segregated locals for black and brown farmers.

The party&#x27;s membership rose by over 50,000 from 1901 to 1910. The party had 4,320 members in 1901, 20,763 in 1904, 41,751 in 1908, and 58,011 in 1910.

Elsewhere, the 1912 platform of the Tennessee party stated that white supremacist ideology was a tool of the capitalist class to divide and rule the working class, while the Virginia party passed a resolution three years earlier to focus more attention on encouraging solidarity between black and white workers and to invite nonwhite workers to join the party. Most notable was the Socialist Party of Oklahoma, which led opposition to the state&#x27;s 1910 ballot initiative on a grandfather clause to prevent blacks from voting. Prominent party member Oscar Ameringer wrote the ballot argument against it, and the party launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the question from going to the ballot. Party propaganda argued that if working-class solidarity did not extend across racial lines, then the ruling class would exploit blacks as strikebreakers and an instrument of repression. The state party&#x27;s 1912 platform stated: &quot;safety and advancement of the working class depends upon its solidarity and class consciousness. Those who would engender or foster race hatred or animosity between the white and black sections of the working class are the enemies of both.&quot; This stance earned the party support from key black leaders in the state. In the Southwest, the non-racial United Mine Workers aided black recruitment into the party. Notable figures associated with the party who sought to organize white, black and indigenous workers across color lines through their party or labor movement work included Ameringer, Covington Hall, and Otto Branstetter.

More widely, anti-racist socialists were spurred to action by the Springfield race riot of 1908. Socialist writer William English Walling&#x27;s reporting on the riot inspired another socialist, Mary White Ovington, among others, to work with prominent black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, and Mary Church Terrell to establish the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Walling and Ovington both argued inside the party that it had not done enough to oppose racism and they were joined by other left-wing intellectuals who published articles in the party press about the importance of anti-racism to the socialist cause, including Hubert Harrison and I. M. Rubinow.

The party had a tense and complicated relationship with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). AFL leadership, headed by Samuel Gompers, strongly opposed the Socialist Party, but many rank-and-file unionists in the early 20th century saw the Socialists as reliable political allies. Many moderate Socialists, such as Berger and International Typographical Union President Max S. Hayes, urged close cooperation with the AFL and its member unions. Others in the Socialist Party dismissed the AFL and its craft unions as antiquated and irrelevant, instead favoring the much more radical IWW and the &quot;syndicalist&quot; path to socialism.

In 1911, IWW leader Bill Haywood was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which AFL partisan Morris Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City&#x27;s Cooper Union on January 11, 1912, with Haywood declaring that Hillquit and the Socialists ought to try &quot;a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time&quot; and attacking Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message other than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers&#x27; movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. &quot;A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists&quot;, he declared.

The issue of &quot;syndicalism vs. socialism&quot; was bitterly fought over the next two years, consummated by Haywood&#x27;s recall from the Socialist Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) and the departure of a broad section of the left wing from the organization. The memory of this split made the intraparty battles of 1919–1921 all the more bitter.
The party&#x27;s opposition to World War I caused a sharp decline in membership. It suffered from the Postmaster General&#x27;s decision to refuse to allow the delivery of party newspapers and periodicals via the U.S. mail, severely disrupting the party&#x27;s activity, particularly in rural areas. Radicals moved further left into the IWW or the Communist Party USA. Members who supported the war effort quit, ranging from the rank and file to prominent intellectuals such as Walter Lippmann, John Spargo, James Graham Phelps Stokes and William English Walling. Some briefly formed the National Party in an unrealized hope of merging with the remnants of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive Party and the Prohibition Party. Official membership fell from 83,284 in 1916 to 74,519 in 1918. By 1918, the Socialist Party had won 1,200 political offices, including U.S. representative, 32 state representatives and 79 mayors. It gained new votes in ethnic strongholds such as Milwaukee and New York from conservative German Americans who also opposed the war.

From 1912 to 1938, the party ran more candidates for seats in the United States House of Representatives than any other minor party, with its height being 358 candidates in the 1912 elections. Sixteen Socialist candidates in the 1912 House elections received over 20% of the popular vote and five of those received over 30%.

In June 1918, Debs made an anti-draft speech, calling for draft resistance. Urging young men to ignore the draft law was a crime under the Sedition Act of 1918 and Debs was convicted and sentenced to serve ten years in prison. President Warren G. Harding commuted his and two dozen others&#x27; sentences at Christmastime 1921.

=== Victor Berger in Milwaukee===
According to historian Sally Miller, Victor Berger:
:built the most successful socialist machine ever to dominate an American city...[He] concentrated on national politics...to become one of the most powerful voices in the reformist wing of the national Socialist party. His commitment to democratic values and the non-violent socialization of the American system led the party away from revolutionary Marxist dogma. He shaped the party into force which, while struggling against its own left wing, symbolize participation in the political order to attain social reforms. ... In the party schism of 1919, Berger opposed allegiance to the emergent Soviet system. His shrunken party echoed his preference for peaceful, democratic, and gradual transformation to socialism.

=== Split of the Left Wing Section ===
In January 1919, Vladimir Lenin invited the IWW and the radical wing of the Socialist Party to join in the founding of the Communist Third International, the Comintern. The Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party emerged as an organized faction early that year, building its organization around a lengthy Left Wing Manifesto by Louis C. Fraina. This effort to organize in order to &quot;win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing&quot; was staunchly resisted by the &quot;Regulars&quot;, who controlled a big majority of the seats of the Socialist Party&#x27;s governing NEC. When it seemed certain that the 1919 party elections for a new NEC had been dominated by the Left Wing, the sitting NEC, citing voting irregularities, refused to tally the votes, declared the entire election invalid and in May 1919 suspended the party&#x27;s Russian, Latvian, Ukrainian, Polish, South Slavic and Hungarian language federations, in addition to Michigan&#x27;s entire state organization. In future weeks, Massachusetts&#x27;s and Ohio&#x27;s state organizations were similarly disfranchised and &quot;reorganized&quot; by the NEC, while in New York and Pennsylvania the &quot;Regular&quot; State Executive Committees undertook reorganization of Left Wing branches and locals on a case-by-case basis.
In June 1919, the Left Wing Section held a conference in New York City to discuss its organizational plans. The group found itself deeply divided, with one section, led by NEC members Alfred Wagenknecht and L. E. Katterfeld and including famed radical journalist John Reed favoring a continued effort to gain control of the SPA at its forthcoming Emergency National Convention in Chicago, to be held at the end of August, while another section, headed by the Russian Socialist Federation of Alexander Stoklitsky and Nicholas Hourwich and the Socialist Party of Michigan seeking to wash its hands of the Socialist Party and immediately move to establish a new Communist Party of America. Eventually, this latter Federation-dominated group was joined by important Left Wingers C. E. Ruthenberg and Louis Fraina, a depletion of Left Wing forces that made the result of the 1919 Socialist Convention a foregone conclusion.
Regardless, Wagenknecht&#x27;s and Reed&#x27;s plans to fight it out at the 1919 Emergency National Convention continued apace. With the most radical state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan) and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, made an effort to occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called to their aid the already present police, who obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly in the hands of the Regulars from the outset, the gathering&#x27;s outcome was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering that established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in Chicago, the Federations and Michiganders and their supporters established the Communist Party of America at a convention gaveled to order on September 1, 1919. Unity between these two communist organizations was a lengthy and complicated process, formally taking place at a secret convention held at the Overlook Mountain House hotel near Woodstock, New York, in May 1921 with the establishment of a new unified Communist Party of America. A Left Wing loyal to the Communist International remained in the Socialist Party through 1921, continuing the fight to bring the Socialist Party into the ranks of the Comintern. This group, which opposed the underground secret organizations the Communist Parties had become, included noted party journalist J. Louis Engdahl and William Kruse, head of the party&#x27;s youth affiliate, the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, as well as a significant segment of the Socialist Party&#x27;s Chicago organization. These left-wing dissidents continued to make themselves heard until their departure from the party after the 1921 convention.

=== Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly ===

On January 7, 1920, less than a week after the Palmer Raids had swept and stunned the country, the New York Assembly was called to order. The majority Republicans easily elected their candidate for the Speaker, Thaddeus C. Sweet and after opening day formalities the body took a brief recess. Back in session, Sweet declared: &quot;The Chair directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to present before the bar of the House Samuel A. DeWitt, Samuel Orr, Louis Waldman, Charles Solomon, and August Claessens&quot;, the Assembly&#x27;s five Socialist members.
Sweet attacked the five, declaring they had been &quot;elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States&quot;. The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was &quot;not truly a political party&quot;, but rather &quot;a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors&quot;. The party had denounced America&#x27;s participation in the European war and had lent aid and comfort to Ludwig Martens, the &quot;self-styled Soviet Ambassador and alien, who entered this country as a German in 1916&quot;. It had supported the revolutionaries in Germany, Austria and Hungary, Sweet continued; and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the Communist International. Sweet concluded:

It is every citizen&#x27;s right to his day in court. If this house should adopt a resolution declaring your seat herein vacant, pending a hearing before a tribunal of this house, you will be given an opportunity to appear before such tribunal to prove your right to a seat in this legislative body, and upon the result of such hearing and the findings of the Assembly tribunal, your right to participate in the actions of this body will be determined.

The Assembly suspended the quintet by a vote of 140 to 6, with one Democrat supporting the Socialists. Civil libertarians and concerned citizens raised their voices to aid the suspended Socialists and protest percolated throughout the press. The principal argument was that the expulsion of elected members of minority parties by majority parties from their councils set a dangerous precedent in a democracy. The battle culminated in a highly publicized trial in the Assembly, which dominated the body&#x27;s activity from its opening on January 20, 1920, until its conclusion on March 11. Socialist Party leader and former 1917 New York City mayoral candidate Morris Hillquit served as chief counsel for the suspended Socialists, aided by party founder and future Socialist vice-presidential candidate Seymour Stedman.

At the trial, Hillquit charged that Sweet had made a &quot;specific, concrete, definite, affirmative declaration of guilt&quot; of the five Assemblymen before they were ever charged with any offense. It was also Sweet who appointed the members of the Judiciary Committee to which the matter was referred. &quot;Thus the accuser selects his own judges&quot;, Hillquit declared. Hillquit sought to remove for reasons of bias any members of the Judiciary Committee who had taken part in the activities of the Lusk Committee, the New York State Senate&#x27;s anti-radicalism committee. He particularly challenged the presence of Assemblyman Louis A. Cuvillier, who had stated on the floor of the house the previous night words to the effect that &quot;if the five accused Assemblymen are found guilty, they ought not to be expelled, but taken out and shot&quot;. The Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion on April 1, 1920.

On September 16, 1920, a special election was held to fill the five seats vacated by the Assembly, with each of the five expelled Socialists running for reelection against a &quot;fusion&quot; candidate representing the combined Republican and Democratic parties. All five Socialists were returned to office.

Three of the five, Waldman, Claessens and Solomon, were again denied their seats after a contentious debate by votes of 90 to 45 on September 21, 1920. Orr and DeWitt, deemed less culpable than their peers by the earlier findings of the Judiciary Committee, were seated by votes of 87 to 48. In solidarity with their ousted colleagues, the pair refused to take their seats.

After the five seats were again vacated, Hillquit expressed his disappointment at the Assembly&#x27;s &quot;unconstitutional action&quot;. But, he continued, &quot;it will draw the issues clearer between the united Republican and Democratic parties representing arbitrary lawlessness, and the Socialist Party, which stood and stands for democratic and representative government&quot;.

The legislature attempted to prevent the election and seating of Socialists in the future by passing laws designed to exclude the Socialist Party from recognition as a political party and to alter the legislature&#x27;s oath-taking procedures so that elected members could be excluded before being sworn. Governor Al Smith vetoed the legislation.

=== Quest for a mass Farmer–Labor Party ===
In the first half of 1919, the Socialist Party had over 100,000 dues-paying members, and by the second half of 1921 it had been shattered. Fewer than 14,000 members remained in party ranks, with the departure of the large, well-funded Finnish Socialist Federation adding to the malaise. In September 1921, the NEC determined that the time had come to end the party&#x27;s historic aversion to fusion with other political organizations and issue an appeal declaring that the &quot;forces of every progressive, liberal, and radical organization of the workers must be mobilized&quot; to repel conservative assaults and &quot;advance the industrial and political power of the working class&quot;.

This desire for common action seems to have been shared by various unions, as late in 1921 a call was issued in the name of the country&#x27;s 16 major railway labor unions seeking a Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA). The CPPA was originally intended to be an umbrella organization bringing together various elements of the farmer and labor movement together in a common program. Invitations to the group&#x27;s founding conference were issued to members of a wide variety of &quot;progressive&quot; organizations of widely varied perspectives. As a result, from its inception the heterogeneous body was unable to agree on a program or a declaration of principles, let alone congeal into a new political party.

The Socialist Party was an enthusiastic supporter of the CPPA and the group dominated its thinking from the start of 1922 through the first quarter of 1925. In this period of organizational weakness, the party sought to forge lasting ties with the existing trade union movement, leading in short order to a mass labor party in the United States on the British model.

A first National Conference of the CPPA was held in Chicago in February 1922, attended by 124 delegates representing a broad spectrum of labor, farmer and political organizations. The gathering passed an &quot;Address to the American People&quot; stating its criticism of existing conditions and formally proposing an amorphous plan of action validating the status quo ante: the labor unions on the group&#x27;s right wing to endorse labor-friendly candidates of the Democratic Party, the Socialists and Farmer-Labor Party adherents on the group&#x27;s left wing to conduct their own independent campaigns. From the Socialist Party&#x27;s perspective, perhaps the most important thing the CPPA did at its first National Conference was agree to meet again. The party leadership understood the process of building an independent third party that could count on the allegiance of the country&#x27;s trade union leadership would be a protracted process and the mere fact of &quot;agreement to disagree&quot; but nevertheless meeting again was regarded as a step forward.

The communist movement also sought to pursue the strategy of bursting from its isolation by forming a mass Farmer-Labor Party. Finally emerged from its underground existence in 1922, the Communists, through their &quot;legal political party&quot;, the Workers Party of America, sent four delegates to the CPPA&#x27;s December 1922 gathering. But after protracted debate, the Credentials Committee strongly objected to the participation of Communist representatives in its proceedings and issued a recommendation that Workers Party&#x27;s representatives and youth organization not be seated. The Socialist Party&#x27;s delegates strongly supported excluding the Communists and acted accordingly, even though the two organizations shared a vision of a party akin to the British Labour Party in which constituent political groups jointly participated while retaining their independent existence. The fissure between the organizations thus widened.

As with the first conference, the 2nd Conference of the CPPA split over the all-important issue of an independent political party, with a proposal by five delegates of the Farmer-Labor Party calling for &quot;independent political action by the agricultural and industrial workers through a party of their own&quot; defeated by a vote of 52 to 64. A majority report declaring against an independent political party was instead adopted. This defeat of the bid for an independent political party cost the CPPA one its major component organizations, with the Farmer-Labor Party delegation announcing that its group would no longer affiliate with the CPPA after the convention. Although the Socialists did not realize it at the time, the chances that the organization would ever be transformed into an authentic mass Farmer-Labor party like British Labour were greatly lessened by the FLP&#x27;s departure.

The Socialists remained optimistic, and the May 1923 National Convention of the Socialist Party voted after lengthy debate to retain its affiliation with the CPPA and to continue its work for an independent political party from within that group. The May 20 vote in favor of maintaining affiliation with the CPPA was 38–12. Failing a mass farmer-labor party from the CPPA, the Socialists sought at least a powerful presidential nominee to run in opposition to the old parties. A 3rd National Conference of the CPPA was held in St. Louis, Missouri, on February 11 and 12, 1924, a gathering that punted on the issue of committing itself to the 1924 presidential campaign, deciding instead to &quot;immediately issue a call for a convention of workers, farmers, and progressives for the purpose of taking action on nomination of candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, and on other questions that may come before the convention&quot;.

The decisive moment finally came on July 4, 1924, a date that was not selected accidentally. The 1st National Convention of the CPPA was assembled in Cleveland at the city auditorium, which was packed with close to 600 delegates representing international unions, state federations of labor, branches of cooperative societies, state branches and national officers of the Socialist, Farmer-Labor and Progressive Parties as well as the Committee of 48, state and national affiliates of the Women&#x27;s Committee on Political Action and sundry individuals. Very few farmers were in attendance.

It was around this time that the Socialists began actively participating in discussions about democratic principles as much as Marxist ones. By 1924, they supported the Progressive Party ticket, which pushed for the reform of the Democratic Party. Ten years after that, the American Socialists adopted a &quot;clearly undemocratic, quasi-Leninist platform&quot; that lobbied for the removal of the current &quot;bogus democracy of capitalist parliamentarianism&quot;. Wanting the government to be replaced by a &quot;genuine worker&#x27;s democracy&quot;, the American Socialist Party stated that &quot;whether or not it is a majority, will not shrink from the responsibility of organizing and maintaining a government under the workers&#x27; rule&quot;. This was seen as an attempt to propose a political reform that would ultimately result in a better social and economic reform consistent with their beliefs.
The National Committee had previously requested that Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette run for president. The Cleveland Convention was addressed by La Follette&#x27;s son, Robert M. La Follette Jr., who read a message from his father accepting the call and declaring that the time had come &quot;for a militant political movement independent of the two old party organizations&quot;. But La Follette declined to lead a third party, seeking to protect those progressives elected nominally as Republicans and Democrats. He said that the primary issue of the 1924 campaign was breaking the &quot;combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people&quot;. After the November election a new party might well be established, La Follette said, that might unite all progressives.

The Socialist Party enthusiastically supported La Follette&#x27;s independent candidacy, declining to run its own candidate in 1924. Although La Follette garnered five million votes, his campaign failed to seriously challenge the old parties&#x27; hegemony and was regarded by the unions as a disappointing failure.

After the election, the governing National Committee of the CPPA met in Washington, D.C. While the body had a mandate from the July convention to issue a call for a convention to organize a new political party, the representatives of the critical railway unions, with the exception of William H. Johnston of the Machinists, were united in opposition to the idea. The railroad unions instead proposed a motion not to hold the 1925 organizational convention. This proposal was defeated by a vote of 30 to 13. After their defeat on this question, the railroaders on National Committee members withdrew from the meeting, announcing that they would await further instructions from their respective organizations with regard to future participation. The loss of the very unions that had brought about the CPPA spelled its demise.

The National Committee nonetheless scheduled a convention to decide on the formation of a new political party for February 21, 1925, to be held in Chicago. &quot;Labor&quot;, the official organ of the railway unions, did nothing to promote this 2nd Convention of the CPPA, stating that since the executives of the various unions had taken no stance on the matter, it would be up to subordinate sections to consider sending delegates themselves.

The February 1925 convention found its task virtually insurmountable as the heterogeneous organization had split over the fundamental question of realignment of the major parties via the primary elections process as opposed to establishment of a new competitive political party. The railway unions, whose efforts who had originally brought the CPPA into existence, were fairly solidly united against the Third Party tactic, instead favoring continuation of the CPPA as a sort of pressure group for progressive change within the Democratic and Republican parties.

L. E. Sheppard, president of the Order of Railway Conductors of America, presented a resolution calling for a continuation of the CPPA on non-partisan lines as a political pressure group. This proposal was met by an amendment by Morris Hillquit of the Socialist Party, who called the five million votes cast for La Follette an encouraging beginning and urged action for establishment of an American Labor Party on the British model—in which constituent groups retained their organizational autonomy within the larger umbrella organization. A third proposal was made by J.A.H. Hopkins of the Committee of Forty-Eight, which called for establishment of a Progressive Party built around individual enrollments. No vote was ever taken by the convention on any of the three proposals mooted. Instead, after some debate the convention was unanimously adjourned &quot;sine die&quot;—bringing an abrupt end to the Conference for Progressive Political Action.

Debs addressed a &quot;mass meeting&quot; including delegates of the convention in a keynote address delivered at the Lexington Hotel early in the afternoon of February 21. After his speech, those delegates favoring establishment of a new political party reconvened, with the opponents of an independent political party departing. The reconvened Founding Convention found itself split between adherents of a non-class Progressive Party based upon individual memberships as opposed to the Socialists&#x27; conception of a class-conscious Labor Party employing &quot;direct affiliation&quot; of &quot;organizations of workers and farmers and of progressive political and educational groups who fully accept its program and principles&quot;. After extensive debate, the Socialist counterproposal was defeated by a vote of 93 to 64. The trade unions it coveted gone, the farmers nonexistent, the Socialist Party exited the convention and abandoned the strategy of establishing a new mass party through the CPPA. The remaining liberals formed a Progressive Party that survived for a short time in a limited number of states throughout the 1920s.

=== Left turn and split of the Old Guard ===

In 1928, the Socialist Party returned as an independent electoral entity under the leadership of Norman Thomas, a radical Protestant minister from New York City. This reentry into the electoral fray behind Thomas fueled major growth of the party during the first years of Great Depression, primarily among youth. A skilled orator and advocate of step-by-step solution of social problems, Thomas had excellent access to churches, colleges and civic institutions. He also had, as New York social democrat Louis Waldman later noted, &quot;those qualities of mind and character which appealed to the intelligent and educated young people of the country and which drew them into the ranks of the party in unprecedented numbers&quot;.

The 1928 convention voted to reduce membership dues to just $1 per year, with only half that sum going to the use of the National Office and the balance retained by state and local organizations. This level of funding proved insufficient for anything beyond the bare minimum of operations by the National Office in Chicago—no official party publication was made available to the members of the organization, with several privately held socialist newspapers fulfilling the function as fonts of party information.

The dues rate cut did prove helpful in reducing the party&#x27;s membership slide. After nearly a decade of steady decline, the Socialist Party again began to grow, advancing from a low of under 8,000 dues payers in 1928 to a membership of almost 17,000 by 1932. But this growth came at a price, as deep factional divisions developed between the youthful newcomers (radicalized and drawn to militant Marxism by the world economic crisis) and the &quot;Old Guard&quot; headed by Morris Hillquit, James Oneal and Waldman.

The generational battle first erupted at the May 1932 Milwaukee Convention. Participant Anna Bercowitz noted four primary factions at this gathering, i.e. an Old Guard defending the current course of the party and the position of Hillquit, practical Socialists of the Milwaukee type, the young Marxist Militants and liberal pacifist Thomasites such as Devere Allen who followed Thomas&#x27;s lead.

The groups which represented the so-called &#x27;New Blood&#x27; at the convention, the Militants and the Liberals and which at this convention merged for the sole purpose of deposing the present leadership [of the party] had little in common. Many members of the most aggressive, although numerically weakest of these groups, the Militants, had little in common with the so-called Thomasites. ... And as for the so-called Mid-western group, although they cast their vote with the opposition, on fundamentals they too are opposed to much of the liberalizing tendencies manifest in the party in recent years. Yet they voted, contrary to their usual procedure in their respective communities, with the opposition. That trades had been made there can be no doubt, and that some groups had been used as innocent dupes can also hardly be doubted...Fundamentally there is much more in common between the Militants and the so-called &#x27;Old Guard&#x27; than between the Militants and the [religious pacifist] Thomasites and surely than between the frank practical &#x27;mid-western&#x27; type of Socialists, yet when it was a question of vote on the Russian resolution, on the TU [Trade Union] resolution and on the question of the National Chairman and the Executive Committee votes were not cast on the basis of principles but apparently on the basis of &#x27;trades&#x27;. The real difference between the Militants and the &#x27;Old Guard&#x27; seems to be based on lack of sufficient activity and on tempo rather than on principle.

Hillquit was challenged at the 1932 convention by Daniel Hoan of Milwaukee, with the Militants and the Thomas group voting for Hoan with the Midwesterners. Hillquit was reelected National Chairman by a vote of 105–86, representing paid memberships of 7526 to 6984. Six members of the newly elected NEC were adherents of the Hillquit-Old Guard faction. It is clear that to some large extent the controversy between the young newcomers of the Militant faction and that of the so-called Old Guard can be reduced to this struggle for practical control of the party apparatus. Historian Frank Warren notes that &quot;one cannot understand the Old Guard&#x27;s actions unless one recognizes its intense desire to maintain its place in the party hierarchy; the drives of the young were a threat to the power of the New York Old Guard.&quot; He also adds that &quot;clearly one would falsely idealize the Militants if one failed to recognize that their ambitions were not always selfless&quot;.

In addition to the raw struggle for control of the party apparatus, there was also a divergence of visions about the role of the Socialist Party in the then-current crisis of capitalism, with mass unemployment at home and the growth of fascism and militarism abroad. The alternative vision of the Militants would be expressed at the subsequent convention of the party held in Detroit in June 1934, at which it was Thomas and his tactical allies of the Militant faction who emerged triumphant. It was this gathering that adopted a new Declaration of Principles that inflamed the Old Guard faction on a number of different levels.
The ideological differences between the radical pacifist Thomas and his allies of the Militant faction on the one hand and the Old Guard faction on the other have been succinctly summarized as follows:

The Old Guard was convinced that the 1934 Declaration of Principles was an open declaration in favor of armed insurrection; Thomas believed it was a necessary statement to indicate that Socialists would not lie down in the face of fascism. The Old Guard believed that the anti-war sections of the Declaration of Principles placed the party under the threat of legal prosecution for advocating unlawful actions to oppose war; again Thomas believed that a strong statement was necessary to put capitalism on warning that if it engaged in imperialist war there would be opposition. The Old Guard believed that a united front with the Communists was immoral and would be disastrous for the Socialists, that even limited united action on specific causes should be banned, and even that exploratory discussions about a united front were going too far. Thomas opposed a united front on a general level, including any joint actions in political contests, but he thought that carefully planned united action on specific cases could, and should, take place. And he believed that it was worth while to conduct exploratory talks, even though he felt they would likely lead to nothing. The Old Guard felt that the Socialists&#x27; invitation to unaffiliated radicals and the Party&#x27;s acceptance of former Communists, Lovestoneites, and Trotskyists was turning the party away from democratic socialism and to Communism. Thomas, though he disagreed with the ideology of these anti-Stalinist Communists, was willing to try to work with a party that included them, if they were willing to accept party discipline and not try to take over the Party. The Old Guard considered the Revolutionary Policy Committee, a far-left group within the Socialist Party, a Communist and anarchist group that had no place in a democratic socialist party. Thomas disagreed with the &#x27;romantic revolutionists&#x27; in the Revolutionary Policy Committee (as he disagreed with the &#x27;romantic parliamentarians&#x27; of the Old Guard), but still felt it was useful to try to salvage some of the enthusiasm and dedication that went into the Revolutionary Policy Committee by permitting its members to remain in the Party if, again, they followed party policy and party discipline.

In addition to the generational and ideological differences between the young Militant faction and the Old Guard and their divergence over tempo of activity and party personnel was great disagreement about matters of symbolism and style. Many of the young radicals dressed and acted in marked contrast to their staid, buttoned-down elders, as New York Old Guard leader Louis Waldman recounted in a 1944 memoir:

Symptoms of a new and dangerous spirit among the Socialist youth began to become manifest on all sides. The youngsters appeared at meetings of the party in blue shirts and red ties. At first this attracted no special attention, for oddity in dress is no novelty among radicals. But gradually their number increased and we now could see that this was a uniform. The Socialist youth of America, like the fascist youth in Europe, had succumbed to the shirt mania.The shirt tendency was followed by the salute mania. In Europe, the Nazi salute was the outstretched arm; here in America the United Front was symbolized by the adoption of the Communist clenched fist salute. This greeting, a raised arm at a slightly different angle from the Nazi or Communist salute, now became routine at all our meetings. [...] Some of the older members of the party were truly horrified at this totalitarian tendency, but others couldn&#x27;t resist the trend and fell into line. Among these, I painfully record, was Norman Thomas.Along with the blue shirts, the red ties, the clenched fists, the raised arm salute, came the banners, the slogans, the demonstrations; all the trappings that make for totalitarian, unthinking mass fervor. These now became regular features at party gatherings. I can still recall the howl of triumph that rose from these young people at one of our meetings when for the first time Norman Thomas returned the clenched fist salute to them. As I stood at his side, my arms deliberately folded to indicate that I would have no part of this, their cheers for Thomas rose to almost uncontrollable frenzy.

After its loss on the floor of the Detroit Convention, the Old Guard took its case to the rank and file of the party, who had been called upon to either approve or defeat the new Declaration of Principles in a referendum. A Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party was established and an agitational pamphlet published. New York State Assemblyman Charles Solomon was the author of the group&#x27;s first polemical piece, &quot;Detroit and the Party&quot;, urging defeat of the 1934 Declaration of Principles by the membership at referendum&quot;.&quot; In this pamphlet, he decried the Detroit Declaration of Principles as &quot;reckless&quot;, observing pointedly that &quot;furious phrases cannot take the place of organized mass power&quot;. Solomon noted that over &quot;the past three or four years&quot; there had arisen &quot;certain definite groups&quot; in the ranks of the Socialist Party. He continued:

The Declaration does not stand by itself, in a vacuum, as it were. Important as it is, it does not alone account for the vital struggle that is now being waged in the party. It represents the culminating point of a deep-seated antagonism. It is like the straw that breaks or threatens to break the camel&#x27;s back. The Declaration of Principles has brought to the surface divergences which are deep, antagonisms which make of our party not a coherent political organization working harmoniously for a common objective but a battle ground of internecine strife.
Solomon charged that the &quot;so-called &#x27;left was &quot;making its position clear&quot; with the Declaration of Principles. &quot;There was no mistaking the flag it had unfurled&quot;, he declared; &quot;[i]t was the banner of thinly veiled communism&quot;. While he declared that &quot;the Declaration of Principles must be decisively rejected in the referendum&quot;, he nevertheless strongly hinted that a factional split was in the offing. Merely defeating the proposed Declaration of Principles was &quot;not enough&quot;; he concluded that the &quot;Socialist Party must be made safe for Socialism, for social democracy&quot;.

&quot;American Socialist Quarterly&quot; editor Haim Kantorovitch made the case for the Militant faction in a pamphlet urging approval of the Declaration of Principles at referendum:

The declaration of principles does not call for insurrection or violence. It simply states that if capitalism should collapse, the Socialist Party will not shrink from the responsibility of taking power. In case of a collapse of capitalism, if the socialists refuse to take power, the fascists will. To say beforehand that in time of a general collapse of capitalism...the socialists will not dare take power before they have a clear mandate from the majority through a democratic vote, is the same as saying that in case of a general collapse of capitalism the Socialist Party will voluntarily, in the name of democracy, turn over the power to the fascists or other reactionary elements, and continue their democratic propaganda from concentration camps.

The membership of the Socialist Party approved the 1934 Declaration of Principles in its referendum, a victory that moved the Old Guard toward the exits—although factional fighting continued into 1936. In 1936, the leaders of the Old Guard formed a new rival organization to the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Federation, and somewhat reluctantly endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in that year&#x27;s election. They also worked to establish the American Labor Party (ALP), a labor-oriented umbrella organization that included both socialist and non-socialist elements, both putting forward its own candidates and endorsing those of the Democratic and Republican parties.

=== End Poverty in California movement ===
The novelist Upton Sinclair had long been associated with the Socialist Party in California. He was twice its candidate for Congress and its nominee for governor in 1930, but won fewer than 50,000 votes. In 1934, Sinclair ran in the Democratic primary for governor and astonished everyone by winning on a promise of radical socialist economic reforms he dubbed End Poverty in California movement (EPIC). Conservative and Republican elements rallied against Sinclair and defeated him in the general election. The Socialist Party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party, and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign. Sinclair won 879,537 votes, doubling his primary total, but that was only 38% of the record-breaking turnout as Republican Frank Merriam won with 49% while Raymond Haight, running under the Progressive Party banner, collected 13%. State Socialist Party chair Milen Dempster mounted a feeble effort to hold back the enthusiasm for Sinclair, gaining less than 3,000 votes. The expulsions destroyed the Socialist Party in California. More important, Sinclair&#x27;s campaign encouraged many radicals in other states to turn away from the Socialist Party. Membership, which had climbed back above 19,000 in 1934, declined to less than 6,000 in 1937 and barely 2,000 in 1940.

=== Demise of the all-inclusive party ===

Norman Thomas, his radical pacifist co-thinkers, and their young Marxist allies of the Militant faction sought to build a mass political movement by transforming the Socialist Party into what they called an &quot;all-inclusive party&quot;. Not only was an appeal made to the radical intellectuals and trade unionists who were the historic core of the organization, but an effort was made to work closely with the Communist Party in joint actions and to infuse the Socialist Party with the leading personnel of small radical oppositional organizations, including in particular the anti-Stalinist communist groupings headed by Jay Lovestone (the so-called &quot;Lovestoneites&quot;) and James P. Cannon (the so-called &quot;Trotskyists&quot;). An array of left-wing intellectuals came into the Socialist orbit as a result of this venture, including (from the Lovestoneites) Bertram D. Wolfe, Herbert Zam and Benjamin Gitlow, as well as (from the Trotskyists) Max Shachtman, James Burnham, Martin Abern and Hal Draper. A broad array of radicals from other tendencies also contributed to the pages of the party&#x27;s official theoretical journal, including from the Communist Party orbit Joseph P. Lash of the American Student Union, the radical novelist James T. Farrell, public intellectual Sidney Hook, leading American Marxist of the 1910s Louis B. Boudin and Canadian Trotskyist Maurice Spector.

A bid was made to unite the factional and marginalized American Left in a common cause, and great hope was held for success in the enterprise. After the Nazis rose in Germany and Austria by 1934, no longer did the Communist Party engage in its Third Period epithets against the Socialists as so-called &quot;social fascists&quot;. Lillian Symes wrote in the Socialist Party&#x27;s theoretical magazine in February 1937 of the &quot;incredible change&quot; taking place in the Communist Party in its seeming abandonment of sectarianism and move toward a broad &quot;people&#x27;s front&quot; against fascism. At the same time, other radical organizations sought to alter their tactics so as to rapidly build an aggressive left-wing organization to oppose nascent fascism. Since 1934, the French Trotskyist organization had entered the French Socialist Party in an effort to build its strength and win support for its ideas. Pressure to follow this policy of the &quot;French Turn&quot; was building among the American Trotskyist group. For a brief period in 1935 and 1936, the vision of the Socialist Party as an &quot;all-inclusive party&quot; that aggregated radical oppositionists and possibly even worked with the Communist Party in common cause seemed achievable.

In January 1936, just as the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party was expelling the Old Guard, a factional battle was being won in the Trotskyist Workers Party of the United States to join the Socialist Party when a national branch referendum voted unanimously for entry. Negotiations began between the Workers Party and Socialist leaderships, with the decision ultimately made to allow admissions only on the basis of individual applications for membership, rather than en masse admission of the entire group. On June 6, 1936, the Workers Party&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The New Militant&quot;, published its last issue and announced &quot;Workers Party Calls All Revolutionary Workers to Join Socialist Party&quot;. About half of the Workers Party heeded the call and entered the Socialist Party.

Although party leader Jim Cannon later hinted that the Trotskyists&#x27; entry into the Socialist Party had been a contrived tactic aimed at stealing &quot;confused young Left Socialists&quot; for his own organization, it seems that at its inception, the entryist tactic was made in good faith. Historian Constance Myers notes that &quot;initial prognoses for the union of Trotskyists and Socialists were favorable&quot; and it was only later that &quot;constant and protracted contact caused differences to surface&quot;. The Trotskyists retained a common orientation with the radicalized Socialist Party in their opposition to the European war, their preference for industrial unionism and the Congress of Industrial Organizations over the trade unionism of the American Federation of Labor, a commitment to trade union activism, the defense of the Soviet Union as the first workers&#x27; state while at the same time maintaining an antipathy toward Stalin&#x27;s regime and in their general aims in the 1936 election.

Norman Thomas attracted nearly 188,000 votes in his 1936 Socialist Party run for President, but performed poorly in historic strongholds of the party. Moreover, the party&#x27;s membership had begun to decline. The organization was deeply factionalized, with the Militant faction split into right (&quot;Altmanite&quot;), center (&quot;Clarity&quot;), and left (&quot;Appeal&quot;) factions, in addition to the radical pacifists led by Thomas and the midwestern &quot;constructive&quot; socialists led by Dan Hoan. A special convention was planned for the last week of March 1937 to set the party&#x27;s future policy, initially intended as an unprecedented &quot;secret&quot; gathering.

=== Split with the Trotskyists ===
Before the March convention, the Trotskyist Socialist Appeal faction held an organizational gathering of their own, meeting in Chicago, with 93 delegates gathering on February 20–22, 1937. The meeting organized the faction on a permanent basis, electing a National Action Committee of five to &quot;coordinate branch work&quot; and &quot;formulate Appeal policies&quot;. Two delegates from the Clarity caucus were in attendance. James Burnham vigorously attacked the Labour and Socialist International, the international organization of left-wing parties to which the Socialist Party belonged, and tension rose along these lines among the Trotskyists. United action between the Clarity and Appeal groups was not forthcoming and an emergency meeting of Vincent R. Dunne and Cannon was held in New York with leaders of the various factions, including Thomas, Jack Altman, and Gus Tyler of Clarity. At this meeting Thomas pledged that the upcoming convention would make no effort to terminate the various factions&#x27; newspapers.

No action was taken at the 1937 convention to expel the Trotskyist &quot;Appeal faction&quot;, but pressure continued to build along these lines, fueled by the Communist Party&#x27;s increasingly hysterical denunciations of Trotsky and his followers as wreckers and agents of international fascism. The convention passed a ban on future branch resolutions on controversial matters, an effort to rein in the factions&#x27; activities at the local level. It also banned factional newspapers, a move directly targeting &quot;The Socialist Appeal&quot;, and formally established &quot;The Socialist Call&quot; as the party&#x27;s national organ.

Constance Myers indicates that three factors led to the expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937: the divergence between the official Socialists and the Trotskyist faction on the issues, the determination of Altman&#x27;s wing of the Militants to oust the Trotskyists, and Trotsky&#x27;s own decision to move toward a break with the party. Recognizing that the Clarity faction had chosen to stand with the Altmanites and the Thomas group, Trotsky recommended that the Appeal group focus on disagreements over Spain to provoke a split. At the same time, Thomas, freshly returned from Spain, had concluded that the Trotskyists had joined the Socialist Party not to make it stronger, but to capture it for their own purposes. On June 24–25, 1937, a meeting of the Appeal faction&#x27;s National Action Committee voted to ratchet up the rhetoric against American Labor Party and Republican nominee for mayor of New York Fiorello LaGuardia, a favorite son of many in Socialist ranks, and to reestablish its newspaper, &quot;The Socialist Appeal.&quot; This was met with expulsions from the party beginning August 9 with a rump meeting of the Central Committee of Local New York, which expelled 52 New York Trotskyists by a vote of 48 to 2, with 18 abstentions, and ordered 70 more to be brought up on charges. Wholesale expulsions followed, with a major section of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League leaving the party with the Trotskyists.

Secretary of Local New York Jack Altman declared that the Trotskyists &quot;were expelled for attempting to undermine the Socialist Party, for loyalty and allegiance to an opponent organization, the Bureau of the Fourth International, and for refusing to abide by the decisions and discipline of the National convention, the National Executive Committee, and the City Central Committee of the party, and for no other reason&quot;. Editor Gus Tyler of &quot;The Socialist Call&quot; echoed Altman&#x27;s sentiments, emphasizing that &quot;the Trotskyites have, during the last week, [...] abandoned the usual means of inner party controversy—debate and appeals through party channels—and, like the Old Guard, have carried their argument into the public, into the capitalist press&quot;. &quot;The Socialist Call&quot;″s editor saw the Trotskyist faction&#x27;s issuance of a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the relaunch of its newspaper, &quot;The Socialist Appeal&quot;, as particularly galling.

=== Collapse of the united front ===

Things turned out no better for the official Communist Party, devoted as it was to Stalin&#x27;s regime. The February–March 1937 joint plenum of the Central Committee and Central Control Commission of the All-Union Communist Party in Moscow, which green-lighted a massive avalanche of secret police terror known to history as the Great Purge, changed everything. Baby steps towards multi-candidate elections and the rule of law in the Soviet Union crumbled instantly as show trials, spy mania, mass arrests and mass executions swept the land. The Trotskyist movement in the Soviet Union was particularly targeted, accused of plotting murder of Soviet officials and conducting sabotage and espionage in preparation for a fascist invasion—seemingly insane charges that the Soviet elite genuinely believed. Blood flowed like water as alleged Trotskyists and other politically suspect individuals were rounded up, &quot;investigated&quot; and disposed of with a pistol shot in the base of the skull or a 10-year sentence in the gulag. Around the world, Stalin&#x27;s and Trotsky&#x27;s adherents raged against each other.

In Spain, the country in which the Lovestoneites invested most of their emotional energy as fervid supporters of the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), 1937 marked a similar bloodbath, with the Communist Party of Spain achieving hegemony among the Republican forces and conducting bloody purges of their own at the Soviet secret police&#x27;s behest. Joint action between Communist oppositionists and the unflinching loyalists to Moscow was henceforth impossible.

In 1937, Norman Thomas willingly acceded to a request from the League for Industrial Democracy (LID) to write a pamphlet on &quot;Democracy versus Dictatorship&quot;. Thomas pulled no punches about the regime in the Soviet Union:

There are still in both the eastern and western hemispheres many examples of rather crude and primitive military dictatorships. [...] They preach a nationalism whose benefits, spiritual or material, to some degree are for all the people. They profess a positive and paternal concern for the masses. If they rule them sternly that is for their own good. [...]In the USSR the dictatorship has been the dictatorship of the Communist Party, but all of its professions and all of its performance has been in the name of the entire working class, and the Communist Party still gives lip-service to a final withering away of all dictatorship, even the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Thomas further noted the Communist Party monopoly on the press, radio, schools, army and government and recalled his own recent visit to Moscow, writing:

The old keenness of political discussion in the party has almost died, at least in so far as policy is concerned. (Criticism of administration is still allowed). A quotation from Stalin is a final answer to all argument. He receives the same sort of exaggerated veneration in public appearances, in the display of his picture, and in written references to him that is accorded to a Mussolini or a Hitler.

Any thought of common-cause with the Communists was now dismissed by Thomas, who indicated that the Communists&#x27; fairly recent change of line from fighting the existing trade unions and damning of all political opponents as &quot;social fascists&quot; to attempting to build a &quot;popular front&quot; was merely tactical, related to the perceived needs of Soviet foreign policy to build coalitions with capitalist countries to forestall fascist invasion.

The factional havoc of the move to the &quot;all-inclusive party&quot; paralyzed activity while the Old Guard&#x27;s new group, the Social Democratic Federation of America, controlled the bulk of the Socialist Party&#x27;s former property and the allegiance of those best able to fund the organization. The expulsions of the Trotskyists and disintegration of the party&#x27;s youth section left the organization greatly weakened, its membership at a new low.

=== Opposition to the New Deal and discrimination in the armed services ===

By 1940, only a small committed core remained in the Socialist Party, including a considerable number of militant pacifists. The Socialist Party continued to oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal as a capitalist palliative, arguing for fundamental change through socialist ownership. In 1940, Thomas was the only presidential candidate who did not support rearmament of Great Britain and China. He also served as an active spokesman for the isolationist America First Committee during 1941.

After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the declaration of war, the United States&#x27; self-defense and war against fascism was supported by most of the remaining Militants and all of the Old Guard. But the Socialist Party adopted a compromise position that did not openly oppose American participation in the war. Its failure to support the war created a rift with many leaders, like the Reuther Brothers of the United Auto Workers. The party&#x27;s pacifist wing did not advocate any systematic antiwar activities, such as the general strike endorsed by the 1934 Declaration of Principles.

Socialist A. Philip Randolph emerged as one of the most visible spokesmen for African American civil rights. In 1941, Randolph, Bayard Rustin and A. J. Muste proposed a march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to propose the desegregation of the American armed forces. The march was canceled after Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, the Fair Employment Act. Roosevelt&#x27;s order applied to banning discrimination in only the war industries, not the armed forces, but the Fair Employment Act is generally perceived as a success for African American labor rights.

In 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at Madison Square Garden to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, war industries, government agencies and labor unions. Following the act, during the Philadelphia Transit Strike of 1944 the government backed African American workers&#x27; striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.

In 1947, Randolph and colleague Grant Reynolds renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent Civil Disobedience. On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman abolished racial segregation in the armed forces through Executive Order 9981. Thomas led his last presidential campaign in 1948, after which he became a critical supporter of the postwar liberal consensus. The party retained some pockets of local success in cities such as Milwaukee, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Reading, Pennsylvania. In New York City, it often ran candidates on the Liberal Party line.

=== Reunification ===

Reunification with the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) was long a goal of Norman Thomas and his associates remaining in the Socialist Party. As early as 1938, Thomas had acknowledged that a number of issues had been involved in the split which led to the formation of the rival Social Democratic Federation, including &quot;organizational policy, the effort to make the party inclusive of all socialist elements not bound by communist discipline; a feeling of dissatisfaction with social democratic tactics which had failed in Germany&quot; as well as &quot;the socialist estimate of Russia; and the possibility of cooperation with communists on certain specific matters&quot;. Still, he held that &quot;those of us who believe that an inclusive socialist party is desirable, and ought to be possible, hope that the growing friendliness of socialist groups will bring about not only joint action but ultimately a satisfactory reunion on the basis of sufficient agreement for harmonious support of a socialist program&quot;.

The Socialist Party and the SDF merged to form the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation (SP-SDF) in 1957. A small group of holdouts refused to reunify, establishing a new organization called the Democratic Socialist Federation. When the Soviet Union led an invasion of Hungary in 1956, half of the members of Communist Parties around the world quit—in the United States alone half did and many joined the Socialist Party.

=== Realignment, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty ===
In 1958, the party admitted to its ranks the members of the recently dissolved Independent Socialist League, which had been led by Max Shachtman. Shachtman had developed a Marxist critique of Soviet Communism as &quot;bureaucratic collectivism&quot;, a new form of class society that was more oppressive than any form of capitalism. Shachtman&#x27;s theory was similar to that of many dissidents and refugees from communism, such as the theory of the &quot;new class&quot; proposed by Yugoslavian dissident Milovan Đilas (Djilas). Shachtman was an extraordinary public speaker and formidable in debate and his intelligent analysis attracted young socialists like Irving Howe and Michael Harrington. Shachtman&#x27;s denunciations of the Soviet 1956 invasion of Hungary attracted younger activists like Tom Kahn and Rachelle Horowitz.

Shachtman&#x27;s youthful followers were able to bring new vigor into the party and Shachtman encouraged them to take positions of responsibility and leadership. As a young leader, Harrington sent Kahn and Horowitz to help Bayard Rustin with the civil rights movement. Rustin had helped to spread pacificism and non-violence to leaders of the civil rights movement like Martin Luther King Jr. while Kahn and Horowitz quickly became close assistants of Rustin. The civil rights movement benefited from intelligence and analysis of Shachtman and increasingly of Kahn. Rustin and his young aides, dubbed the Bayard Rustin Marching and Chowder Society by Harrington, organized many protest activities. The young socialists helped Rustin and A. Philip Randolph organize the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

Harrington soon became the most visible socialist in the United States when his &quot;The Other America&quot; became a best seller, following a long and laudatory &quot;New Yorker&quot; review by Dwight Macdonald. Harrington and other socialists were called to Washington, D.C., to assist the Kennedy administration and then the Johnson administration&#x27;s War on Poverty and Great Society.

The young socialists&#x27; role in the civil rights movement made the Socialist Party more attractive. Harrington, Kahn and Horowitz were officers and staff-persons of the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), which helped to start the New Left Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The three LID officers clashed with the less experienced activists of SDS, like Tom Hayden, when the latter&#x27;s Port Huron Statement criticized socialist and liberal opposition to communism and criticized the labor movement while promoting students as agents of social change. LID and SDS split in 1965, when SDS voted to remove from its constitution the &quot;exclusion clause&quot; that prohibited membership by communists. The SDS exclusion clause had barred &quot;advocates of or apologists for totalitarianism&quot;. The clause&#x27;s removal effectively invited &quot;disciplined cadre&quot; to attempt to &quot;take over or paralyze&quot; SDS as had occurred to mass organizations in the thirties.

The experience of the civil rights movement and the coalition of labor unions and other progressive forces suggested that the United States was changing and that a mass movement of the democratic left was possible. In terms of electoral politics, Shachtman, Harrington and Kahn argued that it was a waste of effort to run electoral campaigns as Socialist Party candidates against Democratic Party candidates. They instead advocated a political strategy called &quot;realignment&quot; that prioritized strengthening labor unions and other progressive organizations that were already active in the Democratic Party. Contributing to the day-to-day struggles of the civil rights movement and labor unions had gained socialists credibility and influence and had helped to push politicians in the Democratic Party toward social-democratic positions on civil rights and the War on Poverty.

=== From the Socialist Party to Social Democrats, USA ===

The Socialist Party&#x27;s 1972 convention had two co-chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU); and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were reelected by acclamation. In his opening speech to the convention, Rustin called for the group to organize against the &quot;reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration&quot; and also criticized the &quot;irresponsibility and élitism of the &#x27;New Politics&#x27; liberals&quot;.The party changed its name to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) by a vote of 73 to 34. Renaming the party SDUSA was meant to be &quot;realistic&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored a candidate for President in 1956, who received only 2,121 votes cast in only six states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name &quot;Party&quot; had been &quot;misleading&quot; as &quot;Party&quot; had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name &quot;Socialist&quot; was replaced by &quot;Social Democrats&quot; because many Americans associated the word &quot;socialism&quot; with Soviet Communism. The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the Socialist Workers Party and the Socialist Labor Party.

The Unity Caucus had a supermajority of votes and its position carried on every issue by a ratio of two to one. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Coalition Caucus&quot;, two for the &quot;Debs Caucus&quot; and one for the independent Samuel H. Friedman. Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.

The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for &quot;firmness toward Communist aggression&quot;, but on the Vietnam War the program opposed &quot;any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission&quot; and instead endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington&#x27;s proposal for an immediate withdrawal of American forces was defeated. Harrington complained that after its March 1972 convention the Socialist Party had endorsed George McGovern with a statement loaded with &quot;constructive criticism&quot;. He also complained that the party had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus&#x27;s Arch Puddington replied that the California branch had been especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch had instead focused on a congressional race.

=== Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee and Union for Democratic Socialism ===
Late in October 1972, before the Socialist Party&#x27;s December Convention, Harrington resigned as National Co-Chairman of the Socialist Party. Although little remarked upon at the time despite Harrington&#x27;s status as &quot;possibly the most widely known of the Socialist leaders since the death of Norman Thomas&quot;, it soon became clear that this was the precursor of a decisive split in the organization.

Harrington had written extensively about the progressive potential of the so-called &quot;New Politics&quot; in the Democratic Party and had come to advocate unilateral withdrawal from the Vietnam War and positions more conservative party members saw as &quot;avant-garde&quot; on the questions of abortion and gay rights. This put him and his co-thinkers at odds with the party&#x27;s younger generation of leaders, who espoused a strongly labor-oriented direction for the party and who were broadly supportive of AFL–CIO leader George Meany.

In the early spring of 1973, Harrington resigned from the SDUSA. The same year, he and his supporters formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of whom 2% served on its national board, while approximately 200 had been members of SDUSA or its predecessors whose membership was then 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington. Its high-profile members included Congressman Ron Dellums and William Winpisinger, President of the International Association of Machinists. In 1982, DSOC established the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) upon merging with the New American Movement, an organization of democratic socialists mostly from the New Left.

The Union for Democratic Socialism was another organization formed by former members of the Socialist Party. David McReynolds, who had resigned from the Socialist Party between 1970 and 1971, along with many from the Debs Caucus, were the core members. In 1973, the UDS declared itself the Socialist Party USA.

Most of the socialist press was privately owned as the party was concerned that a single official publication might lead to censorship in favor of the editors&#x27; views, in much the same way Daniel DeLeon used &quot;The People&quot; to dominate the Socialist Labor Party. A number of papers carried the party&#x27;s official notices in its first years, the most important being &quot;The Worker&quot; (New York), &quot;The Appeal to Reason&quot; (Girard, Kansas), &quot;The Socialist&quot; (Seattle and Toledo, Ohio), &quot;The Worker&#x27;s Call&quot; (Chicago), &quot;St. Louis Labor&quot;, and &quot;The Social Democratic Herald&quot; (Milwaukee). The party soon discovered that it needed a more regular means of communication with its members and the 1904 National Convention decided to establish a regular party organ. Over the next seven decades, a series of official publications were issued directly by the SPA, most of which are today available on microfilm in essentially full runs:

<text>Albert Ellis (September 27, 1913 – July 24, 2007) was an American psychologist and psychotherapist who founded rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). He held MA and PhD degrees in clinical psychology from Columbia University, and was certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP). He also founded, and was the President of, the New York City-based Albert Ellis Institute. He is generally considered to be one of the originators of the cognitive revolutionary paradigm shift in psychotherapy and an early proponent and developer of cognitive-behavioral therapies.

Based on a 1982 professional survey of American and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the second most influential psychotherapist in history (Carl Rogers ranked first in the survey; Sigmund Freud was ranked third). &quot;Psychology Today&quot; noted that, &quot;No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&quot;

==Early life==
Ellis was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in The Bronx borough of New York City from a young age. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, while his maternal grandfather originated from Galicia, Poland in Austria-Hungary. He was the eldest of three children. Ellis&#x27; father, Harry, was a broker, often away from home on business trips, who reportedly showed only a modicum of affection to his children. By his teenage years, his parents divorced, and he lived solely with his mother. His father never again played a significant part in his life.

In his autobiography, Ellis characterized his mother, Hattie, as a self-absorbed woman with a bipolar disorder. At times, according to Ellis, she was a &quot;bustling chatterbox who never listened.&quot; She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects, but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis&#x27; mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was often sleeping when he left for school and usually not home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased an alarm clock with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister.

When the Great Depression struck, all three children sought work to assist the family. Ellis was sickly as a child and suffered numerous health problems throughout his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a kidney disease. He was also hospitalized with tonsillitis, which led to a severe streptococcal infection requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven, one of which lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had &quot;developed a growing indifference to that dereliction&quot;.

Ellis committed numerous sexual assaults against women during his teens and early twenties, writing that he became addicted to nonconsensual frotteurism at the age of fifteen, and claimed to have had “had hundreds of frotteur-incited sex adventures” until his twenties. He reported that he &quot;sought out crowded trains, standing rooms in the back of movie theaters, crowded elevators, and other places where I could rub my midsection against women&#x27;s backsides and hips and soon get delicious orgasm,” stating that the encounters were “sometimes nonconsenting.” Ellis also wrote, “I am now, when I think about it, guilty about my acts. I have remorse for what I did,” adding that, “I deplore the sin and accept the sinner” but then went on to say “I knew that frotteurism was wrong – that it is sometimes nonconsenting” but “Subway sex was the cheapest and easiest sex I ever had, and I continued it into my twenties . . . . But in some ways it was great: no fuss, no obligations, no time wasted, no having to put up with the inane conversation of most women, no pregnancy, no disease, no boredom.”

Illness was to follow Ellis throughout his life; at age 40 he developed diabetes.

Ellis had exaggerated fears of speaking in public and during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, he forced himself to talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens over a period of a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.

=== Education and early career ===
Ellis entered the field of clinical psychology after first earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from what was then known as the City College of New York Downtown in 1934. He began a brief career in business, followed by one as a writer. These endeavors took place during the Great Depression that began in 1929, and Ellis found that business was poor and had no success in publishing his fiction. Finding that he could write non-fiction well, Ellis researched and wrote on human sexuality. His lay counseling in this subject convinced him to seek a new career in clinical psychology.

In 1942, Ellis began his studies for a PhD in clinical psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University, which trained psychologists mostly in psychoanalysis. He completed his Master of Arts in clinical psychology from Teachers College in June 1943, and started a part-time private practice while still working on his PhD degree—possibly because there was no licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his PhD; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely used pencil-and-paper personality tests. He concluded that only the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory met the standards of a research-based instrument.

In 1947, he was awarded a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, and at that time Ellis had come to believe that psychoanalysis was the deepest and most effective form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of Sigmund Freud. He sought additional training in psychoanalysis and then began to practice classical psychoanalysis. Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with Richard Hulbeck, a leading analyst at the Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been Hermann Rorschach, the developer of the Rorschach inkblot test). At that time he taught at New York University, Rutgers University, and Pittsburg State University and held a couple of leading staff positions. At this time, Ellis&#x27; faith in psychoanalysis was gradually crumbling.

== Psychological career ==

=== Early theoretical contributions to psychotherapy ===
The writings of Karen Horney, Alfred Adler, Erich Fromm, and Harry Stack Sullivan would be some of the influences in Ellis&#x27;s thinking and played a role in shaping his psychological models. Ellis credits Alfred Korzybski, his book, &quot;Science and Sanity&quot;, and general semantics for starting him on the philosophical path for founding rational therapy. In addition, modern and ancient philosophy (particularly stoicism), and his own experiences heavily influenced his new theoretical developments to psychotherapy. Ellis acknowledged that his therapy was &quot;by no means entirely new&quot;, as in particular Paul Charles Dubois&#x27;s &quot;rational persuasion&quot; had prefigured some of its main principles; Ellis stated he had read him some years after inventing his therapy, but had studied Émile Coué since a young age.

From the late 1940s onward, Ellis worked on rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client&#x27;s self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism, and rigidity. Ellis believed that through rational analysis and cognitive reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs.

In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavioral therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published &quot;How to Live with a Neurotic&quot;, which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the zeitgeist within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was behaviorism, while in clinical psychology it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, Jung, Adler, and Perls. Despite the fact that Ellis&#x27; approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment with the possible exception of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print. He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant up on stage and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client&#x27;s personality, client&#x27;s clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist&#x27;s own preference).

Despite the relative slow adoption of his approach in the beginning, Ellis founded his own institute. The Institute for Rational Living was founded as a non-profit organization in 1959. By 1968, it was chartered by the New York State Board of Regents as a training institute and psychological clinic.

=== Work as sexologist and sex and love researcher ===
By the 1960s, Ellis had come to be seen as one of the founders of the American sexual revolution. Especially in his earlier career, he was well known for his work as a sexologist and for his liberal humanistic, and in some camps controversial opinions on human sexuality. He also worked with noted zoologist and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey and explored in a number of books and articles the topic of human sexuality and love. Sex and love relations were his professional interests even from the beginning of his career. Norman Haire, in his preface to Ellis&#x27; 1952 book &quot;Sex Beliefs and Customs&quot;, applauded the work of the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease while he ridiculed its rival, the National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, who argued that preventive measures such as condoms would encourage vice: Haire called them &quot;the Society for the Prevention of the Prevention of Venereal Disease&quot;.

In 1958, Ellis published his classic work &quot;Sex Without Guilt&quot; which came to be known for its advocacy of a liberal attitude toward sex. He contributed to Paul Krassner&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Realist&quot;; among its articles, in 1964 he wrote &quot;if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?&quot; In 1965, Ellis published a book entitled &quot;Homosexuality: Its Causes and Cure&quot;, which partly saw homosexuality as a pathology and therefore a condition to be cured. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reversed its position on homosexuality by declaring that it was not a mental disorder and thus not properly subject to cure, and in 1976, Ellis clarified his earlier views in &quot;Sex and the Liberated Man&quot;, expounding that some homosexual disturbed behaviors may be subject to treatment but, in most cases, that should not be attempted as homosexuality is not inherently good or evil, except from a religious viewpoint (See &quot;Ellis and religion&quot;, below). Near the end of his life, he finally updated and re-wrote &quot;Sex Without Guilt&quot; in 2001 and released as &quot;Sex Without Guilt in the Twenty-First Century&quot;. In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice.

=== Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) ===
Ellis is primarily known for his development of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). He published his first major book on it in 1962. REBT is an active-directive, philosophically, and empirically based psychotherapy, the aim of which is to resolve emotional and behavioral problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. REBT sees disturbances as caused by characteristics of a person, rather than a particular past event 

REBT is seen as the first form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
Later in life Ellis wrote &quot;I hope I am also not a devout REBTer, since I do not think it is an unmitigated cure for everyone and do accept its distinct limitations.&quot;
=== Unconditional self accepting ===
Ellis advocated the importance of accepting yourself just because you are alive, human, and unique - and not giving yourself a global rating, or being influenced by what others think of you.

=== Integrity assessment studies ===
In 1979 and during the next two decades, one part of Ellis&#x27; research was an exploration of behavioral integrity through applied experimental psychology, focusing on reliability, honesty, and loyalty as psychosocial behavior. Organizational commitment as a cognitive norm, evaluating concretely through images developed in his Institute.

In his book &quot;Personality Theories&quot; developed with Mike Abrams and Lidia Dengelegi Abrams establish the opinions of evaluation of integrity understanding the reason of each personality can have a change in their attitude, reliability is the common factor of their samples taken and of the which great advances were obtained to look for a tool to work with the human mind.

=== Religion ===
In his original version of his book &quot;Sex Without Guilt&quot;, Ellis expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are often needless and harmful to emotional health. He also famously debated religious psychologists, including Orval Hobart Mowrer and Allen Bergin, over the proposition that religion often contributed to psychological distress. Because of his forthright espousal of a nontheistic humanism, he was recognized in 1971 as Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. By 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Ellis most recently described himself as a probabilistic atheist, meaning that while he acknowledged that he could not be completely certain there is no god, he believed the probability a god exists was so small that it was not worth his or anyone else&#x27;s attention.

While Ellis&#x27; personal atheism and humanism remained consistent, his views about the role of religion in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In &quot;The Case Against Religiosity&quot;, a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic, and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers, and aggressive atheists.

Ellis was careful to state that REBT was independent of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy. Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view in one of his last books &quot;The Road to Tolerance&quot;, and he also co-authored a book, &quot;Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach,&quot; with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients.

=== Political views ===
Ellis was a lifelong advocate for peace and an opponent of militarism. He also praised libertarian economist Walter Block&#x27;s book, &quot;Defending the Undefendable&quot;.

==Later life==

===Professional contributions===
While many of his ideas were criticized during the 1950s and &#x27;60s by the psychotherapeutic establishment, his reputation grew immensely in the subsequent decades. From the 1960s on, his prominence was steadily growing as the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) were gaining further theoretical and scientific ground. From then, CBT gradually became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in many countries, mainly due to the large body of rigorously conducted research that underpinned the work of the cognitive therapy school (a key part of the CBT family) founded by Aaron T. Beck. In the late 1960s, his institute launched a professional journal, and in the early 70s established &quot;The Living School&quot; for children between 6 and 13. The school provided a curriculum that incorporated the principles of RE(B)T. Despite its relative short life, interest groups generally expressed satisfaction with its programmer. Many schools of psychological thought became influenced by Albert Ellis, including rational behavior therapy created by a student of his, Maxie Clarence Maultsby Jr. Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 survey, American and Canadian clinical psychologists and counsellors ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the average influence on their field. Also in 1982, in an analysis of psychology journals published in the US it was found that Ellis was the most cited author after 1957. In 1985, the APA presented Ellis with its award for &quot;distinguished professional contributions&quot;.

He held many important positions in many professional societies including the Division of Consulting Psychology of the APA, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, American Association of Marital and Family Therapy, the American Academy of Psychotherapists and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counsellors, and Therapists. In addition Ellis also served as consulting or associate editor of many scientific journals. Many professional societies gave Ellis their highest professional and clinical awards.

In the mid-1990s, he renamed his psychotherapy and behavior change system rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). (It was originally known as rational therapy and then rational-emotive therapy.) This he did to stress the interrelated importance of cognition, emotion, and behavior in his therapeutic approach. In 1994, he also updated and revised his original, 1962 classic book, &quot;Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy&quot;. During the remainder of his life, he continued developing the theory that cognition, emotion, and behavior are intertwined, and that a system for psychotherapy and behavior change must involve all three.

===Public appearance===
Ellis&#x27;s work extended into areas other than psychology, including education, politics, business, and philosophy. He eventually became a prominent and confrontational social commenter and public speaker on a wide array of issues. During his career he publicly debated a vast number of people who represented opposing views to his; this included for example debates with psychologist Nathaniel Branden on Objectivism and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz on the topic of mental illness. On numerous occasions he critiqued opposing psychotherapeutic approaches, and questioned some of the doctrines in certain dogmatic religious systems, i.e., spiritualism and mysticism.

From 1965 until the end of his life he led his famous Friday Night Workshops, in which he conducted therapy sessions with volunteers from the audience. The 1970s found him introducing his popular &quot;rational humorous songs&quot; which combined humorous lyrics with a rational self-help message set to a popular tune. Ellis also held workshops and seminars on mental health and psychotherapy all over the world until his 90s.

===Final years===
Until he fell ill at the age of 92 in 2006, Ellis typically worked at least 16 hours a day, writing books in longhand on legal tablets, visiting with clients, and teaching. On his 90th birthday in 2003, he received congratulatory messages from well-known public figures such as then-President George W. Bush, New York senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the Dalai Lama, who sent a silk scarf blessed for the occasion. In 2004, Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his large intestine. He returned to work after a few months of supportive care.

In 2005, he was removed from all professional duties and from the board of his own institute after a dispute over the management policies of the institute. Ellis was reinstated to the board in January 2006 after winning civil proceedings against the board members who removed him. On June 6, 2007, lawyers acting for Albert Ellis filed a suit against the Albert Ellis Institute in New York state court. The suit alleges a breach of a long-term contract with the AEI and sought recovery of the 45 East 65th Street property through the imposition of a constructive trust.

Despite his series of health issues and profound hearing loss, Ellis never stopped working with the assistance of his wife, Australian psychologist Debbie Joffe Ellis. In April 2006, Ellis was hospitalized with pneumonia, and spent more than a year shuttling between hospital and a rehabilitation facility. He eventually returned to his residence on the top floor of the Albert Ellis Institute where he died on July 24, 2007, in his wife&#x27;s arms. Ellis had authored and co-authored more than 80 books and 1200 articles (including eight hundred scientific papers) during his lifetime. He died aged 93.

During his final years he worked on his only college textbook with longtime collaborator Mike Abrams with whom he co-authored 3 books along with several research articles and chapters, including the textbook &quot;Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives&quot;. Ellis&#x27; penultimate book was an autobiography entitled &quot;All Out!&quot; published by Prometheus Books in June 2010. The book was dedicated to and included contributions by his wife, Debbie Joffe Ellis, to whom he entrusted the legacy of REBT.

In early 2011, the book &quot;Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy&quot; by Albert and Debbie Joffe Ellis was released by the American Psychological Association. The book explains the essentials of the theory of REBT for students and practitioners of psychology as well as for the general public. In 2019 his wife, Debbie Joffe Ellis, updated the Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy book, and the second edition of that book was published. Albert Ellis and Debbie Joffe Ellis worked together in every area of his work in their years together; Albert Ellis entrusted her to continue his work and she was &quot;the greatest love of his life&quot;.

In eulogy of Albert Ellis, APA past president Frank Farley states:Psychology has had only a handful of legendary figures who not only command attention across much of the discipline but also receive high recognition from the public for their work. Albert Ellis was such a figure, known inside and outside of psychology for his astounding originality, his provocative ideas, and his provocative personality. He bestrode the practice of psychotherapy like a colossus...In the opening ceremony of the 2013 American Psychological Association Convention, Ellis was posthumously awarded the APA Award For Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology. It highlights the profound and historic role played in the life and evolution of the fields of psychology and psychotherapy.

==Autobiographical works==
Most of the books Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his personal life to explain how the insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger, and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. &quot;Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You&quot; (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. &quot;All Out!: An Autobiography&quot; (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).

==Personal life==
Ellis&#x27;s first marriage, to Karyl Corper, an actress, in 1938, ended in annulment. He had three children with Karyl after their divorce, when she was married to her husband Tony.

His second marriage, in 1956, to Rhoda Winter, a dancer, ended in divorce.

For 37 years, from 1965 to 2002, he lived in an open relationship with a companion, Janet L. Wolfe, a psychologist who had been executive director of the Ellis institute. She later called him a “closet mensch.”

In 2004 he married Dr. Debbie Joffe, who he described as &#x27;the greatest love of his life&#x27;.

==Criticism==
In his obituary in the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it was reported that some members of the psychotherapeutic establishment accused him of misinterpreting Freud and demanded evidence for his claims. It was noted that others, such as Aaron T. Beck, had conducted more rigorous testing than Ellis.

Ellis was often criticised for his language and his aggressive behaviour, such as in his debate with Ayn Rand follower Nathaniel Branden.

<text>Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor (WoO59, Bia515) for solo piano, commonly known as &quot;Für Elise&quot; (, ), is one of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s most significant popular compositions. It was not published during his lifetime, only being discovered (by Ludwig Nohl) 40 years after his death, and may be termed either a &quot; Bagatelle&quot; or an . The identity of &quot;Elise&quot; is unknown; researchers have suggested Therese Malfatti, Elisabeth Röckel, or Elise Barensfeld.

== History ==
The score was not published until 1867, forty years after the composer&#x27;s death in 1827. The discoverer of the piece, Ludwig Nohl, affirmed that the original autograph manuscript, now lost, had the title: &quot;Für Elise am 27 April [1810] zur Erinnerung von L. v. Bthvn&quot; (&quot;For Elise on April 27 in memory by L. v. Bthvn&quot;). The music was published as part of Nohl&#x27;s &quot;Neue Briefe Beethovens&quot; (New letters by Beethoven) on pages 28 to 33, printed in Stuttgart by Johann Friedrich Cotta.

The version of &quot;Für Elise&quot; heard today is an earlier version that was transcribed by Ludwig Nohl. There is a later revised version from 1822, with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a manuscript by the Beethoven scholar Barry Cooper. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand arpeggios are delayed by a 16th note. There are a few extra bars in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece. The tempo marking &quot;Poco moto&quot; is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed (now lost). The later version includes the marking &quot;Molto grazioso&quot;. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece to a cycle of bagatelles.

Whatever the validity of Nohl&#x27;s edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves whether the second right-hand note in bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody, is an E4 or a D4. Nohl&#x27;s score gives E4 in bar 7, but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all the figures to beginning with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. However, the use of the note D4 in bar 7 can be traced back to a draft Beethoven wrote for the piece that is today housed in the Beethoven-Haus Bonn. Another point in favor of the D4 is that the ascending seventh of the motive in this form is repeated in sequence in bars 9 to 11 that begin the second section of the principal theme.

The pianist and musicologist Luca Chiantore argued in his thesis and his 2010 book &quot;Beethoven al piano&quot; (new Italian edition: &quot;Beethoven al pianoforte&quot;, 2014) that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today. Chiantore suggested that the original signed manuscript, upon which Ludwig Nohl claimed to base his transcription, may never have existed. On the other hand, Barry Cooper wrote, in a 1984 essay in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, that one of two surviving sketches closely resembles the published version.

== Identity of &quot;Elise&quot; ==
It is not certain who &quot;Elise&quot; was, although a list of possible dedicatees have been suggested by various scholars over the years. Evidence suggests that &quot;Elise&quot; was a close friend of Beethoven and probably an important figure in his life.

=== Therese Malfatti ===

Max Unger suggested that Ludwig Nohl may have transcribed the title incorrectly and the original work may have been named &quot;Für Therese&quot;, a reference to Therese Malfatti von Rohrenbach zu Dezza (1792–1851). She was a friend and student of Beethoven&#x27;s to whom he supposedly proposed in 1810, though she turned him down to marry the Austrian nobleman and state official Wilhelm von Droßdik in 1816. The piano sonata no. 24, dedicated to Countess Thérèse von Brunswick, is also referred to sometimes as &quot;für Therese&quot;. The Austrian musicologist Michael Lorenz has shown that Rudolf Schachner, who in 1851 inherited Therese von Droßdik&#x27;s musical scores, was the son of Babette Bredl, born out of wedlock. Babette in 1865 let Nohl copy the autograph in her possession. Dr. Robert Greenberg, who teaches music through The Great Courses, as well as the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and elsewhere, points out that Beethoven&#x27;s notoriously sloppy handwriting might easily have led to the title &quot;Für Therese&quot; being misread as &quot;Für Elise&quot;.

=== Elisabeth Röckel ===
According to a 2010 study by Klaus Martin Kopitz, there is evidence that the piece was written for the 17-year-old German soprano singer Elisabeth Röckel (1793–1883), the younger sister of Joseph August Röckel, who played Florestan in the 1806 revival of Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;. &quot;Elise&quot;, as she was called by a parish priest (later she called herself &quot;Betty&quot;), had been a friend of Beethoven&#x27;s since 1808, who, according to Kopitz, perhaps wanted to marry her. But in April 1810 Elisabeth Röckel got an engagement at the theater in Bamberg where she made her stage debut as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and became a friend of the writer E. T. A. Hoffmann. In 1811 Röckel came back to Vienna, where in 1813 she married Beethoven&#x27;s friend Johann Nepomuk Hummel.

In 2015 Kopitz published further sources about Beethoven&#x27;s relationship to Röckel and the famous piano piece. It shows that she was also a close friend of Anna Milder-Hauptmann and lived together with her and her brother Joseph August in the Theater an der Wien. In a letter to Röckel, which she wrote in 1830, she indeed called her &quot;Elise&quot;.

In 2020 an extended English version of Kopitz&#x27;s essay was published with some new sources.

=== Elise Barensfeld ===
In 2014, the Canadian musicologist Rita Steblin suggested that Elise Barensfeld (1796 – ≥1820) might be the dedicatee. Born in Regensburg and treated for a while as a child prodigy, she first travelled on concert tours with Beethoven&#x27;s friend Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, also from Regensburg, and then lived with him for some time in Vienna, where she received singing lessons from Antonio Salieri. Steblin argues that Beethoven dedicated this work to the 13-year-old Elise Barensfeld as a favour to Therese Malfatti who lived opposite Mälzel&#x27;s and Barensfeld&#x27;s residence and who might have given her piano lessons. Steblin admits that question marks remain for her hypothesis.

== Music ==
The piece can be heard as a five-part rondo, with the form A-B-A-C-A. It is in A minor and in time. It begins with the refrain A, a flowing melody in binary form marked &quot;Poco moto&quot; (literally &quot;a little motion,&quot; a tempo indication that does not appear elsewhere in Beethoven&#x27;s works), with an arpeggiated left hand accompaniment. The unaccompanied oscillation between the dominant E and its chromatic lower neighbor D-sharp that begins the melody has become one of the most recognizable openings in classical music, but it also serves as a main topic of musical discussion. The digression at measure 9 glances at the relative major before returning to the original theme and key, preceded by a prolongation of the dominant, E that extends the opening lower-neighbor oscillation. The pitch outline of these bars, E-F-E-D-C-B, i.e. an upper-neighbor ascent to F5 followed by a descending scale, also forms the basis of the two episodes B and C, thus unifying the piece. The B section that begins in bar 23 is in the submediant, F major. Its theme begins by tracing the outline mentioned above in somewhat elaborated fashion and modulates to the dominant, followed by 32nd-note runs repeating a cadential progression in C major in a codetta-like passage. (The chordal three-note upbeats in the left hand have been anticipated by the transition to this episode in bar 22, a clever unifying touch.) This suggests a rather expansive form, but Beethoven suddenly returns to the dominant of A minor in bar 34, once again lingering on the dominant E and its lower neighbor and leading to an exact repeat of the A section. Although another nominal episode follows (C) at bar 59, it does not leave the tonic and is rather coda-like in feel, unfolding over a dramatic, throbbing tonic pedal in the bass and emphatically cadencing in the home key. Once again, there are unifying relationships with previously heard material. The melody retraces the descending outline alluded to earlier, and the cadence in bars 66-67 is an augmented version of the theme&#x27;s cadence in bars 7–8. After a glance at a Neapolitan harmony (B-flat major) and a cadence at bar 76 that brings the music to a complete halt for the first and only time, an ascending A minor arpeggio and a chromatic descent over two octaves follows, sort of a &quot;cadenza in tempo&quot;, leading to a final repetition of the A section. The piece concludes without an added postlude.

Kopitz presents the finding by the German organ scholar that the letters that spell Elise can be decoded as the first three notes of the piece. Because an E is called an &quot;Es&quot; in German and is pronounced as &quot;S&quot;, that makes E–(L)–(I)–S–E: E–(L)–(I)–E–E, which by enharmonic equivalents sounds the same as the written notes E–(L)–(I)–D–E.

== Popularity ==
Für Elise is widely recognized around the world. It is a piece of intermediate difficulty, graded at a level 7 out of 10 by The Royal Conservatory of Music. According to the pianist Lang Lang, &quot;it may appear simple, but it presents its own challenges.&quot; A large number of children&#x27;s toys incorporated the tune. In Taiwan, Für Elise is one of the two melodies garbage trucks play to ask residents to bring out their trash, the other being Maiden&#x27;s Prayer. Für Elise is nearly universally featured on ringtone websites.

Mina Yang suggested that the melody is popular because the first eight bars can be adapted into a limited &quot;sonic palette&quot; better than most other classical works. This made the melody well-suited for ringtones and music boxes. Moreover, the structure of the first eight bars has some interesting properties:The opening chromatic trill allows immediate identification of the work. The first four antecedent bars are answered neatly by the next four consequent bars, and then the whole eight bars can be looped and repeated &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

<doc id="243605" wikidata="Q1240286" url="?curid=243605" title="Donald Regan">
<text>Donald Thomas Regan (December 21, 1918 – June 10, 2003) was an American government official and business executive who was the 66th United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1981 to 1985 and the White House Chief of Staff from 1985 to 1987 under Ronald Reagan.

Regan studied at Harvard University before he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1946, he began to work for Merrill Lynch, serving as its chairman and CEO from 1971 to 1980.

In the Reagan administration, Regan advocated &quot;Reaganomics&quot; and tax cuts as a means to create jobs and to stimulate production.

==Early life and education==
Donald Regan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of Kathleen (née Ahearn) and William Francis Regan. He was of Irish Catholic origins. Regan earned his Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard College in 1940 and attended Harvard Law School before dropping out to join the Marine Corps at the outset of World War II. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel while he was serving in the Pacific Theater. He was involved in five major campaigns, including Guadalcanal and Okinawa.

In 1942, Regan married the former Ann George Buchanan, with whom he had four children: Donna Regan Lefeve, Donald T. Regan Jr., Richard William Regan, and Diane Regan Doniger.

==Merrill Lynch==

After the war, Regan joined Merrill Lynch in 1946 as an account executive trainee. He worked up through the ranks, eventually taking over as the firm&#x27;s chairman and CEO in 1971; he held those positions until 1980.

Regan was one of the original directors of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and was vice chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 1973 to 1975. He was a major proponent of brokerage firms going public, which he viewed as an important step in the modernization of Wall Street. Under his supervision, Merrill Lynch had its initial public offering on June 23, 1971, becoming the second Wall Street firm to go public after Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.

During his tenure in these two positions, Regan pushed hard for an end to minimum fixed commissions for brokers, which were fees that brokerage companies had to charge clients for every transaction they made on the clients&#x27; behalf. Regan saw them as a cartel-like restriction. His lobbying played a large part of fixed commissions being abolished in 1975.

==Reagan administration==
President Ronald Reagan selected Donald Regan in 1981 to serve as treasury secretary, marking him as a spokesman for his economic policies, dubbed &quot;Reaganomics&quot;. He helped engineer changes in the tax code, reduce income tax rates, and decrease taxes for corporations. Regan unexpectedly swapped jobs with then White House chief of staff James Baker in 1985.

As chief of staff, Regan was closely involved in the day-to-day management of White House policy, which led Howard Baker, Regan&#x27;s successor as chief of staff, to give a rebuke that Regan was becoming a &quot;prime minister&quot; inside an increasingly-complex imperial presidency. During his four years as Secretary of the Treasury, Regan did not have a single one-to-one meeting with the president. Regan was forced to resign for repeatedly disagreeing with the First Lady and for his role in the Iran–Contra affair. The Tower Commission, established by President Reagan to investigate the scandal, concluded that Regan was responsible for the &quot;chaos&quot; that took hold of the White House. &quot;More than almost any Chief of Staff in recent memory, he asserted control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the National Security Adviser. He was personally active in national security affairs, and attended almost all the relevant meetings regarding the Iran initiative. He, as much as anyone, should have insisted that an orderly process be observed.&quot;

Regan&#x27;s 1988 memoir, &quot;For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington&quot;, exposes his disagreements with first lady Nancy Reagan, revealing publicly that she had a personal astrologer who was later revealed to be Joan Quigley with whom she consulted and who helped steer the president&#x27;s decisions. Regan wrote:
Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during my time as White House Chief of Staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco [Quigley] who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.

Ronald and Nancy Reagan denied that astrology influenced any policies or decisions.

Regan is portrayed by Frank Moore in the 2003 TV film &quot;The Reagans&quot;.

==Retirement==
Regan retired quietly in Virginia with Ann Regan, his wife of over 60 years. In later life, he spent nearly 10 hours a day in his art studio painting landscapes. He had four children and nine grandchildren.

==Death==
Regan died of cancer on June 10, 2003, at the age of 84, in a hospital near his home in Williamsburg, Virginia, and was served by Nelsen Funeral Home. His remains were interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Sayings==
&quot;And the horse you rode in on&quot; was a favorite saying of Regan. He learned it from a poker buddy in Texas who said, &quot;fuck you and the horse you rode in on&quot;. Regan adopted the latter part of the phrase. In the portrait of Regan that hangs on the third floor of the treasury, the title of a book in the background reads &quot;And the Horse You Rode In On&quot;.

&quot;You&#x27;ve got to give loyalty down if you want loyalty up.&quot;

<doc id="243613" wikidata="Q165233" url="?curid=243613" title="Network interface controller">
<text>A network interface controller (NIC, also known as a network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter and physical network interface) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.

Early network interface controllers were commonly implemented on expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most newer computers have a network interface built into the motherboard, or is contained into a USB-connected dongle.

Modern network interface controllers offer advanced features such as interrupt and DMA interfaces to the host processors, support for multiple receive and transmit queues, partitioning into multiple logical interfaces, and on-controller network traffic processing such as the TCP offload engine.

== Purpose ==
The network controller implements the electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer and data link layer standard such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. This provides a base for a full network protocol stack, allowing communication among computers on the same local area network (LAN) and large-scale network communications through routable protocols, such as Internet Protocol (IP).

The NIC allows computers to communicate over a computer network, either by using cables or wirelessly. The NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device, as it provides physical access to a networking medium and, for IEEE 802 and similar networks, provides a low-level addressing system through the use of MAC addresses that are uniquely assigned to network interfaces.

== Implementation ==
Network controllers were originally implemented as expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most new computers have a network interface controller built into the motherboard. Newer server motherboards may have multiple network interfaces built-in. The Ethernet capabilities are either integrated into the motherboard chipset or implemented via a low-cost dedicated Ethernet chip. A separate network card is typically no longer required unless additional independent network connections are needed or some non-Ethernet type of network is used. A general trend in computer hardware is towards integrating the various components of systems on a chip, and this is also applied to network interface cards.

An Ethernet network controller typically has an 8P8C socket where the network cable is connected. Older NICs also supplied BNC, or AUI connections. Ethernet network controllers typically support 10 Mbit/s Ethernet, 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, and Ethernet varieties. Such controllers are designated as &quot;10/100/1000&quot;, meaning that they can support data rates of 10, 100 or . 10 Gigabit Ethernet NICs are also available, and, , are beginning to be available on computer motherboards.
Modular designs like SFP and SFP+ are highly popular, especially for fiber-optic communication. These define a standard receptacle for media-dependent transceivers, so users can easily adapt the network interface to their needs.

LEDs adjacent to or integrated into the network connector inform the user of whether the network is connected, and when data activity occurs.

The NIC may include ROM to store its factory-assigned MAC address.

The NIC may use one or more of the following techniques to indicate the availability of packets to transfer:
* Polling is where the CPU examines the status of the peripheral under program control.
* Interrupt-driven I/O is where the peripheral alerts the CPU that it is ready to transfer data.

NICs may use one or more of the following techniques to transfer packet data:
* Programmed input/output, where the CPU moves the data to or from the NIC to memory.
* Direct memory access (DMA), where a device other than the CPU assumes control of the system bus to move data to or from the NIC to memory. This removes load from the CPU but requires more logic on the card. In addition, a packet buffer on the NIC may not be required and latency can be reduced.

== Performance and advanced functionality ==

Multiqueue NICs provide multiple transmit and receive queues, allowing packets received by the NIC to be assigned to one of its receive queues. The NIC may distribute incoming traffic between the receive queues using a hash function. Each receive queue is assigned to a separate interrupt; by routing each of those interrupts to different CPUs or CPU cores, processing of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed improving performance.

The hardware-based distribution of the interrupts, described above, is referred to as receive-side scaling (RSS). Purely software implementations also exist, such as the receive packet steering (RPS), receive flow steering (RFS), and Intel &quot;Flow Director&quot;. Further performance improvements can be achieved by routing the interrupt requests to the CPUs or cores executing the applications that are the ultimate destinations for network packets that generated the interrupts. This technique improves locality of reference and results in higher overall performance, reduced latency and better hardware utilization because of the higher utilization of CPU caches and fewer required context switches.

With multi-queue NICs, additional performance improvements can be achieved by distributing outgoing traffic among different transmit queues. By assigning different transmit queues to different CPUs or CPU cores, internal operating system contentions can be avoided. This approach is usually referred to as transmit packet steering (XPS).

Some products feature NIC partitioning (NPAR, also known as port partitioning) that uses SR-IOV virtualization to divide a single 10 Gigabit Ethernet NIC into multiple discrete virtual NICs with dedicated bandwidth, which are presented to the firmware and operating system as separate PCI device functions.

Some NICs provide a TCP offload engine to offload processing of the entire TCP/IP stack to the network controller. It is primarily used with high-speed network interfaces, such as Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, for which the processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant.
Some NICs offer integrated field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for user-programmable processing of network traffic before it reaches the host computer, allowing for significantly reduced latencies in time-sensitive workloads. Moreover, some NICs offer complete low-latency TCP/IP stacks running on integrated FPGAs in combination with userspace libraries that intercept networking operations usually performed by the operating system kernel; Solarflare&#x27;s open-source OpenOnload network stack that runs on Linux is an example. This kind of functionality is usually referred to as user-level networking.

<text>Sir Martin Archer Shee (23 December 1769 – 13 August 1850) was an Irish portrait painter. He also served as the president of the Royal Academy.

==Early life==
He was born in Dublin, of an old Irish Roman Catholic family, the son of Martin Shee, a merchant, who regarded the profession of a painter as an unsuitable occupation for a descendant of the Shees. His son Martin nevertheless studied art in the Royal Dublin Society and came to London. There, in 1788, he was introduced by Edmund Burke to Joshua Reynolds, on whose advice he studied in the schools of the Royal Academy of Arts.

==Career==
In 1789, he exhibited his first two pictures, the &quot;Head of an Old Man&quot; and &quot;Portrait of a Gentleman.&quot; Over the next ten years he steadily increased in practice. He was chosen an associate of the Royal Academy in 1798.

In 1789, he married Mary, eldest daughter of James Power of Youghal, and in 1800 he was elected a Royal Academician. He moved to George Romney&#x27;s former house at 32 Cavendish Square, and set up as his successor. In addition to his portraits he executed various subjects and historical works, such as Lavinia, Belisarius, his diploma picture &quot;Prospero and Miranda&quot;, and the &quot;Daughter of Jephthah&quot;.

===Writing===

In 1805 he published a poem consisting of &quot;Rhymes on Art&quot;, and a second part followed in 1809. Lord Byron spoke well of it in his &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;. Shee published another small volume of verse in 1814, entitled &quot;The Commemoration of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other Poems&quot;, but this was less successful. He also produced a tragedy, &quot;Alasco&quot;, set in Poland. The play was accepted at Covent Garden, but was refused a licence, on the grounds that it contained treasonable allusions, and Shee angrily resolved to make his appeal to the public. He carried out his threat in 1824, but &quot;Alasco&quot; was still on the list of unacted dramas in 1911. He also published two novels – &quot;Oldcourt&quot; (1829, in three volumes) and &quot;Cecil Hyde&quot; (1834).

On the death of Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1830, Shee was chosen president of the Royal Academy in his stead and shortly afterwards received a knighthood. In 1831, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. 

In an examination before the parliamentary committee of 1836 concerning the functions of the Royal Academy, he ably defended its rights. He continued to paint till 1845, when illness made him retire to Brighton. He was deputised for at the Academy by J. M. W. Turner, who had appointed him a trustee of the projected Turner almshouse. From 1842 to 1849, he was the first president of the Birmingham Society of Artists.

==Death==
Shee died in Brighton in 1850 and was buried in the western extension to St Nicholas&#x27; Churchyard in Brighton. His headstone remains, but has been laid flat and moved to the perimeter of the site.

==Personal life==

Shee had three sons, who became successful barristers, and three daughters. 

Descendants of one of the sons was George Archer-Shee, whose story inspired &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;, a play written by Sir Terence Rattigan and his older half-brother, Martin Archer-Shee MP. 

Shee&#x27;s descendant, Mary Archer-Shee, supports the campaign for the fulfilment of Turner&#x27;s wishes for his bequests.

<doc id="243623" wikidata="Q1131829" url="?curid=243623" title="Federal League">
<text>The Federal League of Base Ball Clubs, known simply as the Federal League, was an American professional baseball league that played its first season as a minor league in 1913 and operated as a &quot;third major league&quot;, in competition with the established National and American Leagues, from to .

The Federal League came together in early 1913 through the work of John T. Powers, and immediately challenged the operations of organized baseball as a minor league playing outside of the National Agreement. After James A. Gilmore succeeded Powers as league president, the league declared itself to be a major league. Playing in what detractors called the &quot;outlaw&quot; league allowed players to avoid the restrictions of the organized leagues&#x27; reserve clause. The competition of another, better paying league caused players&#x27; salaries to skyrocket, demonstrating the bargaining potential of free agency for the first time since the war between the AL and NL.

Notably, six years prior to his founding of the Federal League, John T. Powers took the field to umpire a league game in Goldfield, Nevada on 7 August 1907 with two revolvers strapped around his waist. The local sheriff showed up and disarmed him, before allowing the game to proceed.

Interference by the National and American Leagues in their operations caused the Federal League to fold after the 1915 season. This resulted in a landmark federal lawsuit, &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the Sherman Antitrust Act did not apply to Major League Baseball. The Federal League left its mark on baseball history in the field now known as Wrigley Field, which was originally built for the Chicago Whales Federal League team. The league itself and many sports writers considered it a major league during its existence; organized baseball recognized its major league status in 1968. Not including certain periods of the Negro leagues, it would be the last independent major league outside the established structure of professional baseball to make it to the playing field, and would be the last serious attempt to create a third major league until the abortive Continental League of 1960.

==History==

In 1912, baseball promoter John T. Powers formed an independent professional league known as the Columbian League. However, the withdrawal of one of the organization&#x27;s primary investors caused the league to fail before ever playing a game. Undaunted, Powers tried again the following year, creating a new league with teams in Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Covington, Kentucky. He named the organization the Federal League, and served as its first president.

Because it did not abide by the National Agreement on player payment in place in organized baseball, the Federal League was called an &quot;outlaw league&quot; by its competitors. The Federal League&#x27;s outlaw status allowed it to recruit players from established clubs, and it attracted many current and former players from the major as well as minor leagues. In 1913, the Federal League played as an independent six-team minor league. In its first season Powers initially served as president, but he was soon replaced by James A. Gilmore, under whose leadership the league declared itself a major league for the 1914 season. Other financiers of the League included oil baron Harry F. Sinclair, ice magnate Phil Ball, and George S. Ward of the Ward Baking Company.

As a major circuit, the Federal League consisted of eight teams each season. Four of the teams were placed in cities with existing major league baseball teams (Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Brooklyn). The other four teams were placed in areas without a current major league club (Baltimore, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Kansas City). In the first year, 1914, some of the teams had official nicknames and some did not, but either way, sportswriters were inclined to invent their own nicknames: &quot;ChiFeds,&quot; &quot;BrookFeds,&quot; etc. By the second season, most of the teams had &quot;official&quot; nicknames, although many writers still called many of the teams &quot;-Feds.&quot;

In order for the Federal League to succeed, it needed Big League players. Walter Johnson signed a three-year contract with the Chicago team, but the Senators&#x27; Clark Griffith went personally to Johnson&#x27;s home in Kansas and made a successful counter-offer. Major League players that jumped to the Federal League included Bill McKechnie, Claude Hendrix, Jack Quinn, Russell Ford, Tom Seaton, Doc Crandall, Al Bridwell, and Hal Chase. The Federal League also recruited Big League names to manage the new teams. Joe Tinker managed the Chicago team, Mordecai Brown managed the St. Louis team and Bill Bradley managed the Brooklyn team.

In 1914, the Colonial League began to operate as a Class C level league based in Southern New England. In April, Alexander Bannwart drew notice by acquiring Big Jeff Pfeffer to manage the team in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and by May, it was suspected that Bannwart was working as an agent of the Federal League, which Bannwart denied. Upon these news reports, some of the founding members of the Colonial League resigned, fearing banishment by the National Baseball Commission.

At the April 1915 league meeting, Coppen was re-elected as president and Bannwart was elected secretary. Walter S. Ward, the treasurer of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League and George S. Ward&#x27;s son, was elected as the league&#x27;s treasurer. The Colonial League reorganized itself as a farm system for the Federal League and voluntarily withdrew itself from organized baseball.

The Federal League had close pennant races both years. In 1914, Indianapolis beat out Chicago by 1½ games. 1915 witnessed the tightest pennant race in Major League history, as three teams (Chicago, St. Louis and Pittsburgh) fought into the last weekend of the season. On the season&#x27;s final day, Sunday, October 3, Chicago split a doubleheader with Pittsburgh, winning the darkness-shortened seven-inning nightcap, 3-0; this combined with St. Louis&#x27; 6-2 win over Kansas City, knocked Pittsburgh back to third (albeit just a half-game behind), with Chicago and St. Louis in a virtual tie for first. But since the Whales (86-66) played two fewer games than the St. Louis Terriers (87-67), they were awarded the pennant based on their slightly better winning percentage (.566 to .565). Pittsburgh, with one game unplayed, ended up at 86-67 (.562).

During the 1914–15 offseason, Federal League owners brought an antitrust lawsuit against the American and National Leagues. The lawsuit ended up in the court of Federal Judge (and future Commissioner of Baseball) Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who allowed the case to languish while he urged both sides to negotiate. Swift action might have made a difference, but without the lawsuit going forward, the Federals found themselves in deepening financial straits.

After the 1915 season, the owners of the American and National Leagues bought out half of the owners (Pittsburgh, Newark, Buffalo, and Brooklyn) of the Federal League teams. Two Federal League owners were allowed to buy struggling franchises in the established leagues: Phil Ball, owner of the St. Louis Terriers, was allowed to buy the St. Louis Browns of the AL, and Charles Weeghman, owner of the Chicago Whales, bought the Chicago Cubs. Both owners merged their teams into the established ones. The Kansas City franchise had been declared bankrupt and taken over by the league office after the close of the regular season, and the Baltimore owners rejected the offer made to them. They had sought to buy and move an existing franchise to their city, but were rebuffed, and sued unsuccessfully.

==Legacy==
One of baseball&#x27;s most famous ballparks was originally built for a Federal League team: Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs, began its long life as Weeghman Park, the home of the Chicago Whales. Marc Okkonen, in his book on the Federal League, referred to Wrigley as a &quot;silent monument&quot; to the failed Federal League experiment. Otherwise, few visible remnants were left by the short-lived Federal League. The Baltimore entry sold their facility to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, who renamed it Oriole Park and played there for nearly 30 years before it was destroyed by fire. The Newark ballpark was also used for minor league ball for a short time.

Washington Park III in Brooklyn, completed after the 1915 season was underway, resembled Chicago&#x27;s Weeghman Park. It was used for various sports until the end of 1917 and then for storage until Brooklyn Edison Electric bought the property in 1925 and shortly thereafter tore it down. One wall still stands.

The other Federal League ballparks were demolished quickly, including the home of the Pittsburgh Rebels, Exposition Park, which had been the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League until they moved into Forbes Field in 1909.

The other &quot;silent monument&quot; to the Federal League is a famous legal decision. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot; (brought by the Terrapins, one of the teams which had not been bought out), that Major League Baseball and its constituent leagues were primarily entertainment, not conventional interstate commerce, and thus were exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act; MLB remains the only North American sports league with such a status, and it has not faced any competitor leagues since unlike the other pro sports leagues because of this exemption. Though significantly weakened in the 1970s, this exemption remains intact years later; however, it has been eroded by subsequent court rulings and legislation regarding issues specific to Major League Baseball.

Of the locations of teams in the Federal League, five currently have major league teams. Those are Baltimore, Chicago, Kansas City, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. Brooklyn has a minor league team, the Brooklyn Cyclones. (The major league Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, although the New York Mets, the Cyclones&#x27; parent club, have been located in the adjacent borough of Queens since 1964.) Buffalo and Indianapolis have International League teams, the Buffalo Bisons and Indianapolis Indians, respectively. Newark had a team, the Bears, in the independent Can-Am League, which folded after the 2012 season.

There is at least one achievement of note that happened in Federal League play. Eddie Plank, pitching for the St. Louis Terriers, won his milestone 300th game on September 11, 1915, at St. Louis&#x27; Handlan&#x27;s Park, becoming the first 300-game winning left-hander in the history of major league baseball and one of only six as of 2018. However, that milestone was not acknowledged by Major League Baseball until 1968.

The Federal League was the last serious attempt at creating a &quot;third major league&quot; outside the established structure of professional baseball in the U.S. There was one further attempt at creating a third league – the Continental League in 1959 – but its founders had hoped to find their place within the purview of organized baseball. The Continental League disbanded in 1960 without ever playing a game, making the Federal League the last such league to ever take to the field.

The Federal League features prominently in Ring Lardner&#x27;s sports humor book &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; (1916), in which the protagonist pitches for the Chicago White Sox and repeatedly threatens to jump to the Federal League whenever he feels underappreciated or underpaid.

<text>Midwestcon is a science fiction convention held annually in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area by the Cincinnati Fantasy Group.

Midwestcon is an informal type of convention known as a relaxacon which means that it has no programming. Instead, it is notable as a means for science fiction fans to get together and talk to each other without the distractions of other conventions.

==History==

The 1949 Worldcon took place in Cincinnati, and the first Midwestcon followed in 1950, and has been held every year since, making it the second longest-running SF convention to be held in the same city, and the third oldest in the U.S.

Many significant figures in science fiction have attended Midwestcon, including Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Wilson Tucker served as the perennial toastmaster for many years. Other notable Midwestcon attendees have included:
* Robert Bloch
* Jack L. Chalker
* Robert Coulson
* Harlan Ellison
* Phyllis Eisenstein
* Lloyd Arthur Eshbach
* Philip Jose Farmer
* Randall Garrett
* Joe Haldeman
* David H. Keller
* Stephen Leigh
* George R.R. Martin
* Bea Mahaffey
* Julian May
* Andrew J. Offutt
* Alexei Panshin
* Mike Resnick
* Frank M. Robinson
* Dick Smith
* E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith
* Ted White

Howard DeVore and Margaret Ford Keifer attended all 56 Midwestcons held from 1950 to 2005.

First Fandom was founded at the 1959 Midwestcon.

<text>Kullervo () is an ill-fated character in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic compiled by Elias Lönnrot. 

Growing up in the aftermath of the massacre of his entire tribe, he comes to realise that the same people who had brought him up, the tribe of Untamo, were also the ones who had slain his family. As a child, he is sold into slavery and mocked and tormented further. When he finally runs away from his masters, he discovers surviving members of his family, only to lose them again. He seduces a girl who turns out to be his own sister, having thought his sister dead. When she finds out it was her own brother who seduced her, she commits suicide. Kullervo becomes mad with rage, returns to Untamo and his tribe, destroys them using his magical powers, and commits suicide. 

At the end of the poem the old sage Väinämöinen warns all parents against treating their children too harshly.

== Story ==
The story of Kullervo is laid out in runes (chapters) 31 through 36 of the Kalevala.

=== Rune 31 – Untamo and Kullervo ===

Untamo is jealous of his brother Kalervo, and the strife between the brothers is fed by numerous petty disputes. Eventually Untamo&#x27;s resentment turns into open warfare, and he kills all of Kalervo&#x27;s tribe save for one pregnant girl called Untamala, whom Untamo enslaves as his maid. Shortly afterwards, Untamala gives birth to a baby boy she names &quot;Kullervo&quot;.

When Kullervo is three months old, he can be heard vowing revenge and destruction upon Untamo&#x27;s tribe. Untamo attempts to kill Kullervo three times (by drowning, fire, and hanging). Each time, the infant Kullervo is saved by his latent magical powers.

Untamo allows the child to grow up, then tries three times to find employment for him as a servant in his household, but all three attempts fail as Kullervo&#x27;s and wild nature makes him unfit for any domestic task. In the end, Untamo decides to rid himself of the problem by selling Kullervo to Ilmarinen as a slave.

===Rune 32 – Kullervo and the wife of Ilmarinen===

The boy is raised in isolation because of his status as a slave, his fierce temper, and because people fear his growing magical skills. The only memento that the boy retains from his previous life in a loving family is an old knife that had been passed along to him as an infant.

Pohjan Neito/Tytär (Maiden/Daughter of the North), wife of Ilmarinen, enjoys tormenting the slave boy, now a youth, and sends Kullervo out to herd her cows with a loaf of bread with stones baked into it. This chapter includes a lengthy magical poem invoking various deities to grant their protection over the herd and to keep the owners prosperous.

===Rune 33 – The death of Ilmarinen&#x27;s wife===
Kullervo sits down to eat, but his beloved heirloom knife breaks on one of the stones in the bread. Kullervo is overwhelmed with rage. He drives the cows away to the fields, then summons up bears and wolves from the woods, making them appear like cows instead. He herds these to Ilmarinen&#x27;s house and tells the wicked mistress of the house to milk them, upon which they turn back into wolves and bears and maul her. As she lies there bleeding, she invokes the high god Ukko to kill Kullervo with a magic arrow, but Kullervo prays for the spell to kill her instead for her wickedness, which it indeed does.

===Rune 34 – Kullervo and his parents===

Kullervo then flees from slavery and finds that his family is actually still alive except for his sister, who has disappeared and is feared dead.

===Rune 35 – Kullervo and his sister===

Kullervo&#x27;s father has no more success than Untamo in finding work suited for his son, and thus sends the young man to collect taxes due to his tribe. On his way back home in his sleigh, Kullervo propositions several girls he sees on the way: all of them reject him. Finally, he meets a beggar-girl who also rejects him at first, struggling and screaming when he pulls her into his sleigh. But he starts talking to her sweetly and shows her all the gold he&#x27;s collected during his trip, bribing her into sleeping with him. Afterwards, she asks who he is, and as she realises he&#x27;s her own brother, she commits suicide by throwing herself into the rapidly rushing river nearby. The distraught Kullervo returns to his family and tells his mother what happened.

===Rune 36 – The death of Kullervo===

Kullervo vows revenge on Untamo. One by one, his family members try to dissuade him from the fruitless path of evil and revenge. His mother asks what will become of her and Kullervo&#x27;s father in their old age, and what will become of Kullervo&#x27;s siblings if he&#x27;s not there to take care of them, but Kullervo only replies that they can all die for all he cares about is revenge. As he leaves, he asks if his father, brother and sister will mourn him if he dies, but they say they won&#x27;t—that they&#x27;d rather wait for a better son and brother to be born who is cleverer and more handsome. Finally, Kullervo asks his mother if she&#x27;ll weep for him, and she replies that she will. Kullervo hardens his heart and refuses to reconsider, and goes to war full of haughty pride, singing and playing his horn. 

He becomes so obsessed with his revenge that even as he learns of the deaths of his family members during his journey, he doesn&#x27;t even stop to honour their deaths, apart from weeping a little for his mother—yet he does not pause in his quest for revenge. He prays to the high god Ukko to get from him a magical broadsword, which he then uses to slay Untamo and his tribe, sparing no one, burning down his entire village. 

When he returns home, he finds the dead bodies of his own family littered about the estate. His mother&#x27;s ghost speaks to him from her grave and advises him to take his dog and go to the wild woods for shelter. He does so, but instead of finding shelter, he only discovers the place by the river where he&#x27;d seduced his sister, the earth still mourning out loud of his ruining of her: no plants grow in the spot where he&#x27;d slept with her, either.

Kullervo then asks of Ukko&#x27;s sword if it will have his life. The sword eagerly accepts, noting that as a weapon it doesn&#x27;t care whose blood it drinks—it&#x27;s drunk both innocent and guilty blood before. Kullervo commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword. On hearing the news, Väinämöinen comments that children should never be given away or ill-treated in their upbringing, lest like Kullervo they fail to attain understanding and a man&#x27;s discretion.

== Evaluation ==

Kullervo is fairly ordinary in Finnish mythology, in being a naturally talented magician; however, he is the only irredeemably tragic example. He showed great potential, but being raised badly, he became an ignorant, implacable, immoral and vengeful man.

The death poem of Kullervo in which he, like Macbeth, interrogates his blade, is famous. Unlike the dagger in Macbeth, Kullervo&#x27;s sword replies, bursting into song: it affirms that if it gladly participated in his other foul deeds, it would gladly drink of his blood also. This interrogation has been duplicated in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; with Túrin Turambar talking to his black sword, Gurthang, before committing suicide. (Túrin also, like Kullervo, unwittingly fell in love with his own sister and was devastated when he learned the truth, his sister also killing herself).

Jääkärimarssi (Jäger March), a well-known Finnish military march, evokes Kullervo&#x27;s bitterness in the lines &quot;me nousemme kostona Kullervon/soma on sodan kohtalot koittaa&quot; (We arise like the wrath of Kullervo/so sweet are the fates of war to undergo).

The story of Kullervo is unique among ancient myths in its realistic depiction of the effects of child abuse. Canto 36 ends with Väinämöinen stating that an abused child will never attain a healthy state of mind even as an adult, but will instead grow up to be a very disturbed person.
:Silloin vanha Väinämöinen,
:kunpa kuuli kuolleheksi,
:Kullervon kaonneheksi,
:sanan virkkoi, noin nimesi:
:&quot;Elkötte, etinen kansa,
:lasta kaltoin kasvatelko
:luona tuhman tuuittajan,
:vierahan väsyttelijän!
:Lapsi kaltoin kasvattama,
:poika tuhmin tuuittama
:ei tule älyämähän,
:miehen mieltä ottamahan,

== In drama, music, poetry and games ==

&quot;Kullervo&quot; is an eponymous 1860 play by Aleksis Kivi. An English translation, by Douglas Robinson, was published in 1993: &quot;Aleksis Kivi&#x27;s Heath Cobblers and Kullervo&quot;.

&quot;Kullervo&quot; is an eponymous 1892 choral symphony in five movements for full orchestra, two vocal soloists, and male choir by Jean Sibelius. It was opus 7 for Sibelius and his first successful work.

&quot;Kullervo&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1899) and &quot;Kullervo Rides to War&quot; (1901) are two paintings by Akseli Gallen-Kallela on the myth.

In the &quot;Jäger March (Jääkärin marssi)&quot; by Jean Sibelius one of the lines reads: &quot;Me nousemme kostona Kullervon&quot;, in English: &quot;We shall rise as Kullervo&#x27;s revenge&quot;.

Kullervo is the subject of a 1988 opera by Aulis Sallinen.

Kullervo is also the subject of a symphonic poem composed in 1913 by Leevi Madetoja.

In 2006, the Finnish metal band Amorphis released the album &quot;Eclipse&quot;, which tells the story of Kullervo according to a play by Paavo Haavikko. The play has been translated into English by Anselm Hollo.

The Hilliard Ensemble commissioned an English language setting of Kullervo&#x27;s story, &quot;Kullervo&#x27;s Message&quot;, from Veljo Tormis.

In June 2023, the video game Warframe released a new playable character named for and inspired by Kullervo. 

The 1938 play &quot;Suomi&quot; by Elizabeth Goudge (1900-1984), in her &quot;Three Plays: Suomi; The Brontës of Haworth; Fanny Burney&quot; (Gerald Duckworth, 1939), includes a Kullervo-like character in her modern story of Finland&#x27;s struggle for independence from Tsarist Russia. The mother in the story is called &quot;Suomi&quot;, a nickname based on the Finnish word for &quot;Finland&quot;. Her two sons are Olof and Kryosti. Olof (a Lemminkäinen-figure) is killed by Russians. Kryosti (as a Kullervo-figure) is exiled to Siberia. When he returns, eighteen years later, during the Russian Revolution, he kills Olof&#x27;s son, Sigurd, and then, in a fit of remorse, Kryosti commits suicide. Following the incest-motif of the story of Kullervo, Sigurd and Anna are the twin children of Olof. Ignorant of the fact that they are brother and sister, they marry. But Anna dies in childbirth, and Sigurd is murdered by Kryosti, because of his insane jealousy of his own brother, Olof.

In August 2024, it was announced that Antti Jokinen has been attached to direct the upcoming film &quot;Kalevala: The Story of Kullervo&quot;, and has been cast as the title character in the film.

===Influence on J. R. R. Tolkien===
J. R. R. Tolkien wrote an interpretation of the Kullervo cycle in 1914; the piece was finally published in its unfinished form as &quot;The Story of Kullervo&quot; in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; in 2010, as edited by Verlyn Flieger. It was re-published in book form in 2015 by HarperCollins. It was his first attempt at writing an epic narrative but was never completed. The story acted as a seed for the epic tale of Túrin Turambar which features in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the &quot;Narn i Chîn Húrin&quot; section of &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and, in a longer form, &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; as well as the poem &quot;The Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot;.

<doc id="243642" wikidata="Q124646925" url="?curid=243642" title="Jewish Community Center">
<text>A Jewish Community Center or a Jewish Community Centre (JCC) is a general recreational, social, and fraternal organization serving the Jewish community in a number of cities. JCCs promote Jewish culture and heritage through holiday celebrations, Israel-related programming, and other Jewish education. However, they are open to everyone in the community.

The JCC Association is the continental umbrella organization for the Jewish Community Center movement, which includes more than 350 JCCs, YM–YWHAs, and camp sites in the U.S. and Canada, in addition to 180 local JCCs in the former Soviet Union, 70 in Latin America, 50 in Europe, and close to 500 smaller centers in Israel.

== History ==
The Hebrew Young Men&#x27;s Literary Association was first set up in 1854 in a building at the corner of Fayette and Gay Streets in Baltimore, Maryland to provide support for Jewish immigrants. Dr. Aaron Friedenwald was the group&#x27;s founder and first president.

The first Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YMHA) was founded in New York City on October 10, 1874, with Lewis May as its first president. The first official headquarters were at 112 West 21st Street in Manhattan. Young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YWHA) was first established as an annex to the YMHA in 1888. YWHA was founded to provide spiritual and material support for the young Jewish women who were moving to cities at the time. YMHA helped young Jewish women find housing and employment. Fannie Liebovitz was one of the founders. The first independent YWHA was established in 1902. The New York YMHA and YWHA now operate together as the 92nd Street Y. (There are two other YM–YWHA organizations in Manhattan, which are not affiliated with the 92nd Street Y. They are the 14th Street Y, and the YM &amp; YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood. The 14th Street Y, in the Gramercy/East Village neighborhood, is a branch of the Educational Alliance. The Washington Heights organization serves a diverse community uptown.) In 1917, these organizations were combined into a Jewish Welfare Board.

Following a merger of the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association, Young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Education Alliance, the organization was renamed Jewish Community Center (JCC) in 1951. Many member organizations adopted the new name, but some other member organizations did not do so, particularly in the New York metropolitan area, such as:

* In Manhattan, New York City, New York
** Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan
** YM &amp; YWHA of Washington Heights &amp; Inwood
** 92nd Street Y, (formally, The Young Men&#x27;s and Young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association, New York, New York)
** 14th Street Y
* In Brooklyn, New York
** Boro Park Y in Borough Park, (founded as YMHA)
** Jewish Community House, or JCH, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn
** Kings Bay Y in Sheepshead Bay, with branches in northern Brooklyn
** Shorefront Y
* Riverdale YM-YWHA in the Bronx, New York City, New York
* Samuel Field Y and Central Queens Y in Queens, New York (two agencies merging )
* In New Jersey
** Center for Jewish Life (CJL) in East Brunswick, successor to YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley in Highland Park (closed 2006)
** YM-YWHA of Clifton/Passaic (name retained until its closing in 2011)
** YM-YWHA of North Jersey in Wayne (name retained until sale to Metro YMCA in 2011)
* Jewish Community Alliance of Jacksonville, Florida

An example of the objectives of Jewish Community Centers can be seen within the New Bedford, Massachusetts branch&#x27;s Constitution. In January 1947, the Jewish Community Center of New Bedford listed the following objectives:

* To foster and develop the highest values of Jewish spiritual and cultural life.
* To provide social, educational, literary, benevolent, recreational and athletic activities for the benefit of Jewish men, women, and children of New Bedford.
* To serve the spiritual, intellectual, social, and physical welfare of its members.
* To fulfill the great ideals of American citizenship.

==Services==

JCC Association offers a wide range of services and resources to help its affiliates to provide educational, cultural, social, Jewish identity-building, and recreational programs for people of all ages and backgrounds. JCC Association supports the largest network of Jewish early childhood centers and Jewish summer camps in North America and is also a U.S. government accredited agency for serving the religious and social needs of Jewish military personnel through JWB Jewish Chaplains Council.

Some JCCs provide services for people with disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorders and learning disabilities. In 2008, The Mandel JCC of Cleveland was awarded $652,500 in grant funding to be used for individuals with disabilities. Cleveland-area children and adults with emotional, physical and developmental disabilities now have many opportunities to get involved in fitness, wellness and recreational activities. Whenever possible, activities are inclusive and children are able to fully participate, usually with the assistance of an aide.

As a rule, today JCCs are open to other ethnic groups as well, with a possible exception of strictly traditional Jewish activities. In fact, many JCCs sponsor local events. There are, however, many other activities that anyone can host at the JCC.

==Locations==
There are almost two dozen Jewish community centers in the New York metro area, providing a wide range of social, cultural, and educational services, ranging from lectures, concerts, theater performances, and dance recitals to health and fitness classes, job training workshops, and citizenship classes. Although the majority of JCCs are found on the East Coast, with 17 sites in Florida, JCCs operate in many other communities. For example, California has 17 locations—eight in the San Francisco Bay Area and nine scattered through Southern California—and the Chicago metropolitan area has 10. Almost all of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. now have at least one JCC, and a handful of smaller communities also have locations. JCCs all over the country sponsor film festivals and book fairs, bringing world-renowned writers and directors to smaller communities.

Their programs and activities vary by location. Particularly noteworthy is the JCC in West Bloomfield, Michigan, which is the largest JCC in North America, and possibly the world. The Holocaust Memorial Center, which attracts many visitors to its programs and exhibits, used to be a part of the JCC of West Bloomfield, but recently opened a building of its own. The West Bloomfield JCC houses two gymnasiums which can be made into three gyms using a movable wall, a workout area, an indoor full size and kiddie pool, an outdoor full size pool, a kosher restaurant, a Michigan Jewish war veterans museum, an in line hockey center, a library, ceramics/art rooms, a large multi-purpose room (Handleman Hall), an art museum, an area dedicated to teaching and learning about tzedakah (charity) called Shalom Street, a performing arts theater in the basement, a preschool, offices for summer camps, the previously mentioned preschool, and other administrative offices and organizations. The top floor is completely dedicated to The Jean and Samuel Frankel Jewish Academy of Metropolitan Detroit, a Jewish High School which opened in 2000. The JCC building is on the Eugene and Marcia Applebaum Jewish Community Campus along with multiple living quarters for the elderly and mentally disabled and an Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment building.

A significant addition to the family of JCCs in North America is the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan. This eleven-story building situated in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side neighborhood opened its doors in the winter of 2002. The JCC offers a diversity of programs, from parenting to fitness and wellness, and each year the organization produces four week-long film festivals, an all-night Tikkun Leil Shavuot, a New Year&#x27;s Day fitness fair, and an annual Symposium on Positive Aging. The JCC features multiple centers dedicated to segments of its community, including the Jack and Shirley Silver Center for Special Needs, the Bert and Sandra Wasserman Center for Family Life, the Selma and Lawrence Ruben Center for 20s + 30s, and the new Wechsler Center for Modern Aging, for those aged 60+.

Solar thermal panels were installed at the Joan and Alan Bernikow JCC in Staten Island 2011.

==Incidents and security==
In recent decades, several incidents that have taken place at JCCs and other Jewish-related locations across the United States and Canada, as well as the September 11 attacks, have prompted JCCs in all areas to increase security at their facilities. Some of these events have included:

* As part of the 1950s synagogue bombings, the JCCs in Nashville, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida, were bombed in 1958 by white supremacists opposed to Jewish support for integration in the southern United States. No one was hurt in the bombings.
* The 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires resulted in 85 deaths and over 300 injured persons.
* In 1997, a woman in Toronto was charged with kidnapping and other crimes in the unauthorized removal of her 5-year-old daughter from a JCC childcare center. The woman, a registered nurse who had previously lost custody of her child following a divorce, led police on a high-speed chase and crashed, causing minor injuries to both.
* In the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting on August 10, 1999, a white supremacist opened fire and wounded four children and one adult, who all survived. The shooter was later convicted of homicide in a separate incident.
* In the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting on July 29, 2006, one person was killed when a Muslim man named Naveed Afzal Haq opened fire. This shooting was in response to the offender&#x27;s anger at the United States for the Iraq War and its support for Israel.
* In the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting on April 13, 2014, a white supremacist opened fire in the parking lot of the JCC of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at a nearby Jewish retirement home. Three were killed in the incident and two others were shot at but were unharmed.
* Starting in 2017, over 100 JCCs received bomb threats, along with other Jewish buildings such as schools. By March, two suspects were arrested: Juan M. Thompson, an African-American former journalist who was attempting to frame his ex-girlfriend for making antisemitic threats; and Michael Ron David Kadar, a mentally ill 18-year-old Israeli-American man. who in April 2017 was charged in an Israeli court with several crimes including an attempt to extort a United States senator, &quot;publishing false reports causing public panic, conspiring to commit a crime, hacking computers to commit a crime, and violations of money-laundering laws&quot;. The indictment alleged that he threatened &quot;2,000 different institutions around the world, including the Israeli embassy in Washington, the Israeli consulate in Miami, schools, malls, police stations, hospitals and airlines.&quot; In the same month he faced a similar indictment in a Florida court which included 28 crimes.

<text>Eugene &quot;Jug&quot; Ammons (April 14, 1925 – August 6, 1974), also known as &quot;The Boss&quot;, was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. The son of boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons, Gene Ammons is remembered for his accessible music, steeped in soul and R&amp;B.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Ammons studied music with instructor Walter Dyett at DuSable High School. Ammons began to gain recognition while still at high school when in 1943, at the age of 18, he went on the road with trumpeter King Kolax&#x27;s band. In 1944, he joined the band of Billy Eckstine (who bestowed on him the nickname &quot;Jug&quot; when straw hats ordered for the band did not fit), playing alongside Charlie Parker and later Dexter Gordon. Performances from this period include &quot;Blowin&#x27; the Blues Away,&quot; featuring a saxophone duel between Ammons and Gordon. After 1947, when Eckstine became a solo performer, Ammons then led a group, including Miles Davis and Sonny Stitt, that performed at Chicago&#x27;s Jumptown Club. In 1949, Ammons replaced Stan Getz as a member of Woody Herman&#x27;s Second Herd, and then in 1950 formed a duet with Sonny Stitt.

The 1950s were a prolific period for Ammons and produced some acclaimed recordings such as &quot;The Happy Blues&quot; (1956). Musicians who played in his groups, apart from Stitt, included Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, Kenny Burrell, Mal Waldron, Art Farmer, and Duke Jordan.

His later career was interrupted by two prison sentences for narcotics possession, the first from 1958 to 1960, the second from 1962 to 1969. He recorded as a leader for Mercury (1947–1949), Aristocrat (1948–1950), Chess (1950–1951), Prestige (1950–1952), Decca (1952), and United (1952–1953). For the rest of his career, he was affiliated with Prestige. After his release from prison in 1969, having served a seven-year sentence at Joliet penitentiary, he signed the largest contract ever offered at that time by Prestige&#x27;s Bob Weinstock.

Ammons had the first of two records released by Leonard Chess on the newly-formed Chess Records label in 1950, titled &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (Chess 1425); Muddy Waters was the second record, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (Chess 1426). Both records were released simultaneously.

Ammons died in Chicago on August 6, 1974, at the age of 49, from bone cancer and pneumonia. He was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois.

==Playing style==
Ammons and Von Freeman were the founders of the Chicago school of tenor saxophone. Ammons&#x27;s style of playing showed influences from Lester Young as well as Ben Webster. These artists had helped develop the sound of the tenor saxophone to higher levels of expressiveness. Ammons, together with Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt, helped integrate their developments with the emerging &quot;vernacular&quot; of the bebop movement, and the chromaticism and rhythmic variety of Charlie Parker is evident in his playing.

While adept at the technical aspects of bebop, in particular its love of harmonic substitutions, Ammons stayed in touch with the commercial blues and R&amp;B of his day. For example, in 1950 the saxophonist&#x27;s recording of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; made &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine&#x27;s black pop charts. The soul jazz movement of the mid-1960s, often using the combination of tenor saxophone and Hammond B3 electric organ, counts him as a founder. With a thicker, warmer tone than Stitt or Gordon, Ammons could at will exploit a vast range of textures on the instrument, vocalizing it in ways that anticipated later artists such as Stanley Turrentine, Houston Person, and even Archie Shepp. Ammons showed little interest, however, in the modal jazz of John Coltrane, Joe Henderson or Wayne Shorter that was emerging at the same time.

<text>The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA; ; CLG) is an Irish international amateur sporting and cultural organisation, focused primarily on promoting indigenous Gaelic games and pastimes, which include the traditional Irish sports of hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, Gaelic handball, and GAA rounders. The association also promotes Irish music and dance, as well as the Irish language and it also promotes environmental stewardship through its Green Clubs initiative.

As of 2014, the organisation had over 500,000 members, and declared total revenues of €96.1 million in 2022. The Competitions Control Committee (CCC) of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) governing bodies organise the fixture list of Gaelic games within a GAA county or provincial councils.

Gaelic football and hurling are the most popular activities promoted by the organisation, and the most popular sports in the Republic of Ireland in terms of attendance. Gaelic football is also the second most popular participation sport in Northern Ireland. The women&#x27;s version of these games, ladies&#x27; Gaelic football and camogie, are organised by the independent but closely linked Ladies&#x27; Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association of Ireland, respectively. GAA Handball, is the governing body for the sport of handball, while the other Gaelic sport, rounders, is managed by the GAA Rounders National Council ().

Since its foundation in 1884, the association has grown to become a major influence in Irish sporting and cultural life, with considerable reach into communities throughout Ireland and among the Irish diaspora.

==Foundation and history==

On 1 November 1884, a group of Irishmen gathered in the Hayes&#x27; Hotel billiard room to formulate a plan and establish an organisation to foster and preserve Ireland&#x27;s unique games and athletic pastimes. Arising out of the meeting, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded. The architects and founding members were Michael Cusack of County Clare, Maurice Davin, Joseph K. Bracken, Thomas St George McCarthy, a District Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary, P. J. Ryan of Tipperary, John Wyse Power and John McKay. Maurice Davin was elected president, Cusack, Wyse-Power and McKay were elected Secretaries and it was agreed that Archbishop Croke, Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt would be asked to become Patrons.

In 1922 it turned over the job of promoting athletics to the National Athletic and Cycling Association.

==Competitions==

The GAA organises a number of competitions at divisional, county, inter-county, provincial, inter-provincial and national (All-Ireland) levels. A number of competitions follow a progressive format in which, for example, the winners of a club county football competition progress to a competition involving the top clubs from each county in the province, with the champions from each province progressing through a series of national finals.

==Cultural activities==
The association has had a long history of promoting Irish culture.
Through a division of the association known as Scór (Irish for &quot;score&quot;), the association promotes Irish cultural activities, running competitions in music, singing, dancing and storytelling.

Rule 4 of the GAA&#x27;s official guide states:

&quot;The Association shall actively support the Irish language, traditional Irish dancing, music, song, and other aspects of Irish culture. It shall foster an awareness and love of the national ideals in the people of Ireland, and assist in promoting a community spirit through its clubs.&quot;

The group was formally founded in 1969 and is promoted through various Association clubs throughout Ireland (as well as some clubs outside Ireland).

==Grounds==

The association has many stadiums scattered throughout Ireland and beyond. Every county and nearly all clubs have grounds, with varying capacities and utilities, where they play their home games.

The hierarchical structure of the GAA is applied to the use of grounds. Clubs play at their own grounds for the early rounds of the club championship, while the latter rounds from quarter-finals to finals are usually held at a county ground, i.e. the ground where inter-county games take place or where the county board is based.

The provincial championship finals are usually played at the same venue every year. However, there have been exceptions, such as in Ulster, where in 2004 and 2005 the Ulster Football Finals were played in Croke Park, as the anticipated attendance was likely to far exceed the capacity of the traditional venue of St Tiernach&#x27;s Park, Clones.

===Croke Park===

Croke Park is the association&#x27;s flagship venue and is known colloquially as &quot;Croker&quot; or &quot;Headquarters&quot;, since the venue doubles as the association&#x27;s base. With a capacity of 82,300, it ranks among the top five stadiums in Europe by capacity, having undergone extensive renovations for most of the 1990s and early 21st century. Every September, Croke Park hosts the All-Ireland inter-county Hurling and Football Finals as the conclusion to the summer championships. Croke Park holds the All-Ireland club football and hurling finals. Croke Park is named after Archbishop Thomas Croke, who was elected as a patron of the GAA during the formation of the GAA in 1884.

The Croke Park campus is also home to the National Handball Centre, which replaced the old Croke Park Handball Centre built in the 1970s. The centre is due to be the home of GAA Handball and to play host to All-Ireland Gaelic Handball finals.

===Other grounds===
The next three biggest grounds are all in Munster: Semple Stadium in Thurles, County Tipperary, with a capacity of 53,000, the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick, which holds 50,000, and Páirc Uí Chaoimh, County Cork, which can accommodate 45,000.

Other grounds with capacities above 25,000 include:
*Fitzgerald Stadium, in Killarney, a capacity of 43,180
*MacHale Park in Castlebar, the largest stadium in Connacht (and in the northern half of the country), a capacity of 42,000
*St Tiernach&#x27;s Park in Clones, County Monaghan, hosts most Ulster finals, a capacity of 36,000
*Kingspan Breffni Park, in Cavan Town, County Cavan, which hosted International rules football series games in 2013, a capacity of 32,000
*Casement Park, in Belfast, which had a capacity of approximately 31,500 prior to its closure in 2013
*Nowlan Park, in Kilkenny, a capacity of 27,800
*O&#x27;Moore Park, in Portlaoise, County Laois, a capacity of 27,000
*Healy Park, in Omagh, County Tyrone, a capacity of 26,500
*Pearse Stadium in Galway, which has hosted International rules football series games, a capacity of 26,197

Research by former Fermanagh county footballer Niall Cunningham led to the publication in 2016 by his website, gaapitchlocator.net, of a map of 1,748 GAA grounds in Ireland, ranging from 24 grounds in his own county to 171 in Cork.

==Nationalism and community relations==
The association has, since its inception, been closely associated with Irish nationalism, and this has continued to the present, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, where the sports are played predominantly by members of the mainly Catholic nationalist community, and many in the Protestant unionist population consider themselves excluded by a perceived political ethos. According to one sports historian, the GAA &quot;is arguably the most striking example of politics shaping sport in modern history&quot;.

A perception within Northern Ireland unionist circles that the GAA is a nationalist organisation is reinforced by the naming of some GAA grounds, clubs, competitions and trophies after prominent nationalists or republicans.

Other critics point to protectionist rules such as Rule 42 which prohibits competing, chiefly British, sports (referred to by some as &quot;garrison games&quot; or foreign sports) from GAA grounds. As a result, the GAA became a target for loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles when a number of GAA supporters were killed and clubhouses damaged. As the profile of Gaelic football has been raised in Ulster so too has there been an increase in the number of sectarian attacks on Gaelic clubs in Northern Ireland.

Some of the protectionist rules are as follows:

=== Rule 42 and other sports in GAA grounds ===
Rule 42 (Rule 5.1 in the 2009 rulebook) prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA referred to by some as &quot;garrison games&quot; or foreign sports. Current rules state that GAA property may only be used for the purpose or in connection with the playing of games controlled by the association. Sports not considered &#x27;in conflict&#x27; with the GAA have been permitted.

On 16 April 2005 the GAA&#x27;s congress voted to temporarily relax Rule 42 and allow international soccer and rugby to be played in the stadium while Lansdowne Road Football Ground was closed for redevelopment. The first soccer and rugby union games permitted in Croke Park took place in early 2007, the first such fixture being Ireland&#x27;s home match in the Six Nations Rugby Union Championship against France.

In addition to the opening of Croke Park to competing sports, local GAA units have sought to rent their facilities out to other sports organisations for financial reasons in violation of Rule 42. The continued existence of Rule 42 has proven to be controversial since the management of Croke Park has been allowed to earn revenue by renting the facility out to competing sports organisations, but local GAA units which own smaller facilities cannot. It is also said that it is questionable as to whether or not such rental deals would be damaging to the GAA&#x27;s interests.

=== Defunct rules ===
The GAA has had some notable rules in the past which have since been abolished. Rule 21, instituted in 1897 when it was suspected that Royal Irish Constabulary spies were trying to infiltrate the organization, prohibited members of the British forces from membership of the GAA. The rule was abolished after an overwhelming majority voted for its removal at a special congress convened in November 2001. Rule 27, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Ban&quot;, dated from 1901 and banned GAA members from taking part in or watching non Gaelic games. During that time people such as Douglas Hyde, GAA patron and then President of Ireland, was expelled for attending a soccer international. Rule 27 was abolished in 1971.

===Cross-community outreach in Northern Ireland===
The association points out the role of members of minority religions in the membership throughout its history. For example, the Protestant Jack Boothman was president of the organisation from 1993 to 1997, while Sam Maguire was a Church of Ireland member. Nonetheless, to address concerns of unionists, the association&#x27;s Ulster Council has embarked on a number of initiatives aimed at making the association and Gaelic games more accessible to northern Protestants. In November 2008, the council launched a &quot;Community Development Unit&quot;, which is responsible for &quot;Diversity and Community Outreach initiatives&quot;. The Cúchulainn Initiative is a cross-community program aimed at establishing teams consisting of Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren with no prior playing experience. Cross-community teams such as the Belfast Cuchulainn under-16 hurling team have been established and gone on to compete at the Continental Youth Championship in the USA. Similar hurling and Gaelic football teams have since emerged in Armagh, Fermanagh, Limavady. 
David Hassan, from the University of Ulster, has written about the cross community work of the association and other sporting bodies in Ulster.

The &#x27;Game of three-halves&#x27; cross-community coaching initiative was established in predominantly Protestant east Belfast in 2006. Organised through Knock Presbyterian Church, this scheme brings Association coaches to work alongside their soccer and rugby counterparts to involve primary school children at summer coaching camps. The Ulster Council is also establishing cross-community football and hurling teams in schools and is developing links with the Ulster-Scots Agency and the Church of Ireland. The council has also undertaken a series of meetings with political parties and community groups who would have traditionally have had no involvement in the association.

===Other community outreach===
In January 2011, the then President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, announced the launch of an island-wide project called the &quot;GAA Social Initiative&quot;. This aims to address the problem of isolation in rural areas where older people have limited engagement with the community. The initiative was later expanded by teaming up with the Irish Farmers Association to integrate that organisation&#x27;s volunteers into the initiative.

==Participation outside Ireland==
===Clubs outside Ireland===

Members of the Irish diaspora have set-up clubs in a number of regions and countries outside of Ireland, and there are GAA clubs in the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, China, continental Europe and elsewhere.

The GAA World Games were first played in Abu Dhabi in 2015. The next edition was played in Dublin in 2016 with subsequent editions to be played in Ireland every three years. The 2019 games were awarded to Waterford, but the next edition in Derry was deferred to 2023 due to the Covid pandemic.

===Internationals===
While some units of the association outside Ireland participate in Irish competitions, the association itself does not organise regular international games played according to the rules of either Gaelic football or hurling. However, the first international match between France and Italy was played in 2014.

Compromise rules have been reached with two &quot;related sports&quot;.

Hurlers play an annual fixture against a national shinty team from Scotland.

International Rules Football matches have taken place between an Irish national team drawn from the ranks of Gaelic footballers, against an Australian national team drawn from the Australian Football League. The venue alternates between Ireland and Australia. In December 2006, the International series between Australia and Ireland was called off due to excessive violence in the matches, but resumed in October 2008 when Ireland won a two test series in Australia. The Irish welcomed the All Australian team at the headquarters of the GAA (Croke Park) on 21 November 2015. It was single one-off test match, which led the Irish to reclaim the Cormac McAnallen Cup by a score of 56–52.

===Handball===
The international dimension of Gaelic handball includes a World Championship tournament, alongside a European Tour and US Semi-Professional Tour. The 4-Wall and 1-Wall codes of the game are played around the world [with slightly different rules depending on which country one is playing in] and the World Handball Championships are organised by the World Handball Council. A European Tour has been set up with players from across Europe participating. 4-Wall Handball is played primarily in Ireland, the US and Canada while the 1-Wall code is played (in addition to the three mentioned) in Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Spain and the UK.

==Winter training ban==
To address concerns about player burnout, the association adopted a rule in 2007 that prohibited collective training for inter-county players for a period of two months every winter. This has proven to be controversial in that it is difficult to enforce; in the drive to stay competitive, managers have found ways to avoid it, such as organising informal &#x27;athletic clubs&#x27; and other activities that they can use to work on the physical fitness of players without overtly appearing to be training specifically at Gaelic games.

<text>Quiz Holdings, LLC, doing business as Quiznos, is an American franchised fast-food restaurant based in Denver that specializes in offering toasted submarine sandwiches. It was founded in 1981 by Jimmy Lambatos and sold to Rick and Richard Schaden ten years later. It then grew to nearly 5,000 restaurants; by 2013, Quiznos was the second-largest submarine sandwich shop chain in North America, behind Subway. It filed for bankruptcy in 2014; by 2016, it had dropped to ninth place, and the number of Quiznos locations in the United States fell from a 2007 high of 4,700 to just 400 a decade later.

==History==
===Early history===

The first Quiznos restaurant was opened in 1981 in Denver, Colorado by founder Jimmy Lambatos and his partner, Todd Disner. Lambatos was an experienced chef, having worked as an executive chef for the Colorado Mine Co. Steakhouse and founded the Italian restaurant Footers in 1978.

The first location was at the corner of 13th and Grant Streets in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of the city; it featured special baguette-style bread, special dressings, and unique recipes. Lambatos said of his decision to toast the submarine sandwiches at the first Quiznos that, &quot;it&#x27;s a signature type of thing. Heating anything brings out the flavors in food products.&quot; In addition to submarine sandwiches, the menu included salads, soups, and desserts.

===Expansion===

In 1983, the restaurant started offering franchises to facilitate expansion, under the name Quiznos American, Inc. By 1987, 12 Quiznos restaurant locations were operating in the United States. In the same year, Rick Schaden, at the age of 23, and his father, aviation attorney Richard Schaden, opened their first Quiznos franchise in a Boulder, Colorado shopping center. They opened three additional restaurants before purchasing the 18-restaurant chain from the founders in January 1991. They renamed it the Quiznos Franchise Corp. Rick Schaden became the president and then CEO of Quiznos after the purchase.

Quiznos was taken public in February 1994, with an initial public offering of 1,000,000 shares of stock at $5 per share, resulting in a $4.4 million yield. By the end of 1995, Quiznos had 103 different locations.

In 1997, Quiznos became the number-three submarine sandwich franchise in the world, with 278 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The company again went private in June 2001. In 2005, the company partnered with Ray Wilson to open a new chain of fitness clubs called 123 Fit. At its peak in 2007, there were more than 5,000 Quiznos franchise locations.

Until 2005, The Coca-Cola Company was the primary soft drink supplier for the franchise. In 2003, Coca-Cola signed an exclusive agreement to provide soft drinks to the competing Subway franchise to take effect two years later; Quiznos responded with signing an exclusive deal with PepsiCo (except in Canada and on college campuses that have exclusive deals with Coca-Cola) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (to serve Dr Pepper) to take effect the same year as Subway&#x27;s switchover. In 2019, Quiznos switched back to Coca-Cola products, ending its 14-year relationship with Pepsi.

===International expansion===

The first location in Canada (and outside of the United States) opened in Vancouver in 1996.

In 1998, Quiznos Canada acquired the master franchise rights to Quiznos restaurants in Canada, as well as the master rights in the United Kingdom in 1999. Glenvista Enterprises then acquired the rights for several states in Australia. KMN USA LLC acquired the franchise rights for Japan, opening its first location in early 1999.

The first European location opened in 2001 in Peterborough in England.

In 2002, Wendy&#x27;s acquired the rights to the brand for franchises in Australia and later in New Zealand but was unsuccessful in launching the chain in either country. Quiznos opened a handful of Australian locations until in 2007 they were shut down by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for providing fraudulent information to their franchisees. The first location in Mexico opened in Monterrey in 2002.In 2010 the chain said it planned to expand, opening locations in over 40 countries and territories, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central and South America by 2012.

The first location in India opened in Hyderabad in 2011, followed by the first location in the Philippines opened in 2012.

In July 2013, the company planned to expand into Russia, looking to open about 500 stores. A November 2013 article reported that &quot;Following its most recent international successes in Mexico, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates, Quiznos will bring toasted sandwiches to Indonesia with the signature of PT Quiznosindo as the brand&#x27;s newest franchisor. The group, led by Tan Po Lian, plans to open 100 units in Indonesia over the next 10 years...Expansion into Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia is part of Quiznos&#x27; continued international development plan to open more than 1,000 international stores in more than 40 countries by 2020.&quot;

In 2013, Quiznos opened its first two locations in Russia during the same weekend in St. Petersburg. In 2014, Quiznos opened locations in Iraq and Pakistan.

Quiznos opened its first Taiwan location in Taipei and also its first United Arab Emirates location in Abu Dhabi in September 2014. Quiznos exited the Taiwan market in July 2018 based on a post on the Quiznostaiwan Facebook page.

Quiznos also operated restaurants across Ireland by Supermac&#x27;s. Today all of these have been replaced by Supersubs and the only remaining Quiznos is located in Dublin.

===Restructuring===
Between 2007 and 2009, 1,000 Quiznos stores in the United States closed. After the closure of around 2,000 restaurants during the Great Recession, a majority stake in the company was purchased by Avenue Capital Group of New York in January 2012. In the purchase, about one-third of the company&#x27;s $900 million debt was eliminated, and about $150 million in cash was added to the company&#x27;s balance sheet.&quot; Avenue Capital Group brought on turnaround specialist Harsha V. Agadi as Quiznos executive chairman. They also brought on Stuart Mathis as CEO, the former president of The UPS Store, who said that the company would try to counteract shrinking sales by promoting the quality of its food.

===Bankruptcy===
On March 14, 2014, Quiznos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado. Quiznos said it would continue operating while it restructured its debt and made operational improvements. Quiznos emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 2014, having reduced its debt by approximately $400 million.

===Post-bankruptcy===
On December 1, 2015, Quiznos opened a concept restaurant called Quiznos Grill, hoping to re-brand its products and increase menu offerings. Initial reviews of this restaurant highlighted the high price (US$20) once items were added to the sandwich (vegetables, cheese, etc.) or meal (chips, drinks, etc.). In late 2016, the Quiznos Grill concept was abandoned and relaunched as Zeps Epiq Sandwiches. Some Quiznos Grill sandwiches remained on the menu, while vegetarian choices, salads, all-day breakfasts, and loaded tater tots were added.

On June 11, 2018, Quiznos announced that it had been acquired by California-based High Bluff Capital Partners. The chain did not move its headquarters. The company&#x27;s REGO Restaurant Group announced a new prototype in 2021, the first of which opened in Hobbs, New Mexico. The company&#x27;s new Qube format, pre-fab drive-thru units, fit on smaller parcels, can have better unit economics than traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants, and are cheaper and faster to build.

As of December 6, 2023, 145 Quiznos restaurants remained in the United States, down from 176 in 2022.

==Advertising==
The company&#x27;s first major advertising push was a successful advertising campaign during the 2002 Super Bowl. Early TV spots advertised the innovation of toasting sandwiches, as compared to the inventor of pants (humorously contrasted with men wearing bushes). One commercial in 2003 depicted a man (played by Jim Parsons) who had been &quot;raised by wolves&quot; by suckling at a mother wolf&#x27;s teat. Other promotions include an early 2004 campaign featuring bizarre, rodent-like, singing creatures called Spongmonkeys, edited by Joel Veitch, as well as a series of Quiznos commercials in Canada featuring hockey commentator Don Cherry. In 2005, Quiznos launched a campaign featuring Baby Bob.

In June 2006, Quiznos revealed its new slogan: &quot;Eat Up.&quot; Ads nationwide feature a Quiznos sub with steam emanating from it with the tagline, &quot;Mmmm... toasty.&quot; Actor Michael Clarke Duncan formerly provided the voiceover for all Quiznos commercials. On September 18, 2006, Quiznos launched the most aggressive advertising campaign aimed at Subway. Dubbed the &quot;Prime Rib Cheesesteak Challenge,&quot; customers were asked to compare the brand new Prime Rib Cheesesteak against Subway&#x27;s Cheesesteak sandwich. The claim is that the Prime Rib Cheesesteak has twice the meat of Subway&#x27;s Cheesesteak. If the customers are not satisfied, then they can fill out a form, mail the form along with their receipt, and they will receive a coupon for a free sandwich. In subsequent advertisements, Quiznos was shown competing with the fictional &quot;Wrong Way&quot; restaurant based on competing restaurants.

In 2016, the company launched its mobile-based loyalty program. This app was aimed at rewarding Quiznos&#x27; most loyal customers and to gather customer feedback to improve product and operations.

===Mascots===
In 2004, Quiznos started using fuzzy-looking creatures called the Spongmonkeys (which were designed by Joel Veitch) in their advertising commercials. One plays the guitar, and the other sings &quot;We Love the Subs&quot; in an apparent and shorter spoof of their original song, &quot;We Like the Moon.&quot; Several commercials with the Spongmonkeys were released, including ones about rejoice and coupons. However, after a few months, Quiznos discontinued airing the commercials.

On July 17, 2023, Quiznos announced the return of the Spongmonkeys after almost two decades with a new advertisement (again created and voiced by Veitch) in which they go on a road trip, singing about &quot;the gas prices and public restrooms and the creepy billboards&quot;. The new campaign comes as part of Quiznos&#x27; effort to expand again after their decline in the 2010s.

==Lawsuits and controversies==
Quiznos has been the target of several lawsuits related to its treatment of franchisees, including lawsuits in New Jersey and Wisconsin. It has faced more lawsuits from franchisees than bigger chains, such as McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, Wendy&#x27;s, and even its sandwich competitors Subway and Blimpie, according to an analysis by the legal research firm Thomson West. In February 2007, Quiznos franchisees filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status in Michigan. One lawsuit (filed in New Jersey and seeking class-action status) said that the astounding growth record of Quiznos was merely a mirage. In 2003 and 2004, Quiznos said it sold 234 &quot;trade areas&quot; in New Jersey to franchisees, collecting the $25,000 franchisee fee, but none of these locations ever opened, according to the lawsuit. Three years after handing over her check for the fee, Elisa Whitehall said that she had yet to open a Quiznos in the location she bought and that Quiznos refused to return the fee.

One lawsuit cited a memorandum drafted by a Quiznos lawyer in 2003 that stated, &quot;40 percent of Quiznos units are not breaking even,&quot; a fact that prospective franchisees say they were never told. The United States Small Business Administration said 23.4 percent of Quiznos franchises with SBA loans failed. In contrast, Subway had a 4.8 percent failure rate.

Fredrick N. Westerfield ran three Quiznos in Wisconsin as a single example of an unprofitable franchise. After spending $14,000 in personal savings to keep the stores running, he realized he had a debt of $750,000. He closed all his stores in 2005. &quot;Customers used to come into the store and say to me, &#x27;You must be rolling in the money, recalled Mr. Westerfield. &quot;If they only knew.&quot;

In 2002, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that the company initially ignored the plight of a Quiznos employee who took over operations of one Quiznos store after the true owner abandoned it. Months later, the store was closed. In June 2004, the Quiznos at Downtown Crossing, Boston, was at the center of a hepatitis scare.

In 2006, Quiznos sent letters to 300 franchises saying mystery shoppers would be coming to test their services. The company sued franchise owners Richard Piotrowski and Ellen Blickman for not putting enough meat in a prime rib sandwich. Piotrowski and Blickman countersued and won the lawsuit in 2009. Judge Morris Hoffman called the meat-weighing exercise and subsequent termination letters a &quot;charade&quot; aimed at bolstering a national ad campaign against rival Subway.

On November 27, 2006, Bhupinder Baber, franchise owner of two Quiznos locations in Long Beach, California died by suicide after a legal battle with the company. In his suicide note, Baber said that the way he was treated by Quiznos drove him to suicide. The Toasted Subs Franchisee Association (TSFA), a group of franchisees, posted Baber&#x27;s suicide note on its website, and intended to raise money for Baber&#x27;s family. Quiznos attempted to terminate the TSFA&#x27;s franchises. The TSFA in turn filed an injunction on December 15, 2006, in the District Court of Colorado. A 2014 article in the &quot;Long Beach Post&quot; suggested that the factors that contributed to Baber&#x27;s suicide also led to the parent company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2014.

As of July 1, 2010, Quiznos was close to a settlement over the multiyear class-action lawsuit covering nearly 10,000 of its current and former franchisees. The case comprises four separate class-action lawsuits dating back to 2006 which consolidated in 2009 — involved allegations by attorneys for franchisees that Quiznos Franchise Co. LLC and other entities with ownership or control of the Quiznos chain had violated U.S. racketeering and corruption statutes. Also at issue were the supply chain and food costs, marketing and advertising funds, and disputes among franchisees that agreed to, but did not open, locations and whether royalties are owed. Quiznos denied all claims made in the lawsuits, and the settlement agreement involves no finding or admission of liability. Nonetheless, the cost to Quiznos has been estimated from $100 to $200 million while also forcing it to implement a new business plan &quot;which puts more support into its franchisees&quot;.

<doc id="243651" wikidata="Q311715" url="?curid=243651" title="Art Blakey">
<text>Arthur Blakey (October 11, 1919 – October 16, 1990) was an American jazz drummer and bandleader. He was also known as Abdullah Ibn Buhaina after he converted to Islam for a short time in the late 1940s.

Blakey made a name for himself in the 1940s in the big bands of Fletcher Henderson and Billy Eckstine. He then worked with bebop musicians Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. In the mid-1950s, Horace Silver and Blakey formed the Jazz Messengers, a group which he led for the next 35 years. The group was formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, Johnny Griffin, Curtis Fuller, Chuck Mangione, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Cedar Walton, Woody Shaw, Terence Blanchard, and Wynton Marsalis. &quot;The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz&quot; calls the Jazz Messengers &quot;the archetypal hard bop group of the late 50s.&quot;

Blakey was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame (in 1981). Posthumously, he was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Grammy Hall of Fame (in 1998 and 2001). He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

==Early life and education career==
Blakey was born on October 11, 1919, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, probably to a single mother who died shortly after his birth; her name is often cited as Marie Roddicker, or Roddericker, although Blakey&#x27;s own 1937 marriage license shows her maiden name to have been Jackson. His biological father was Bertram Thomas Blakey, originally of Ozark, Alabama, whose family migrated northward to Pittsburgh sometime between 1900 and 1910. Blakey&#x27;s uncle, Rubi Blakey, was a popular Pittsburgh singer, choral leader, and teacher who attended Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Blakey was raised with his siblings by a family friend who became a surrogate mother. According to Leslie Gourse&#x27;s biography, the surrogate mother was Annie Parran and her husband Henry Parran Sr. The stories related by family and friends, and by Blakey himself, are contradictory as to how long he spent with the Parran family, but it is clear he spent some time with them growing up.

Blakey received some piano lessons at school but was also self-taught.

==Career==
By seventh grade, Blakey was playing music full-time and had begun to take on adult responsibilities, playing the piano to earn money and learning to be a band leader. 

He switched from piano to drums at an uncertain date in the early 1930s. An oft-quoted account of the event states that Blakey was forced at gunpoint to move from piano to drums by a club owner, to allow Erroll Garner to take over on piano. The veracity of this story is called into question in the Gourse biography, as Blakey himself gives other accounts in addition to this one. The style Blakey assumed was &quot;the aggressive swing style of Chick Webb, Sid Catlett and Ray Bauduc&quot;.

From 1939 to 1944, Blakey played with fellow Pittsburgh native Mary Lou Williams and toured with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra. While sources differ on the timing, most agree that he traveled to New York with Williams in 1942 before joining Henderson a year later. (Some accounts have him joining Henderson as early as 1939.) While playing in Henderson&#x27;s band, Blakey was subjected to an unprovoked attack by a white Georgia police officer which necessitated a steel plate being inserted into his head. These injuries caused him to be declared unfit for service in World War II. He led his own band at the Tic Toc Club in Boston for a short time.

From 1944 to 1947, Blakey worked with Billy Eckstine&#x27;s big band. Through this band, Blakey became associated with the bebop movement, along with his fellow band members Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Sarah Vaughan among others.

After the Eckstine band broke up, Blakey states that he traveled to Africa for a time: &quot;In 1947, after the Eckstine band broke up, we—took a trip to Africa. I was supposed to stay there three months and I stayed two years because I wanted to live among the people and find out just how they lived and—about the drums especially.&quot; He stated in a 1979 interview, discussing the context of the decision at the time: 

Blakey is known to have recorded from 1947 to 1949. He studied and converted to Islam during this period, taking the name Abdullah Ibn Buhaina and the nickname &quot;Bu&quot;, although he stopped being a practicing Muslim in the 1950s and continued to perform under the name &quot;Art Blakey&quot; throughout his career.

As the 1950s began, Blakey was backing musicians such as Davis, Parker, Gillespie, Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk; he is often considered to have been Monk&#x27;s most empathetic drummer, and he played on both Monk&#x27;s first recording session as a leader (for Blue Note Records in 1947) and his final one (in London in 1971), as well as many in between. Blakey toured with Buddy DeFranco from 1951 to 1953 in a band that also included Kenny Drew.

===The Jazz Messengers===
On December 17, 1947, Blakey led a group known as &quot;Art Blakey&#x27;s Messengers&quot; in his first recording session as a leader, for Blue Note Records. The records were released as 78 rpm records at the time, and two of the songs were released on the &quot;New Sounds&quot; 10&quot; LP compilation (BLP 5010). The octet included Kenny Dorham, Sahib Shihab, Musa Kaleem, and Walter Bishop, Jr.

Around the same time (1947 or 1949) he led a big band called Seventeen Messengers. The band proved to be financially unstable and broke up soon after. The use of the Messengers tag finally stuck with the group co-led at first by both Blakey and pianist Horace Silver, though the name was not used on the earliest of their recordings.

The &quot;Jazz Messengers&quot; name was first used for this group on a 1954 recording nominally led by Silver, with Blakey, Mobley, Dorham and Doug Watkins—the same quintet recorded &quot;The Jazz Messengers at the Cafe Bohemia&quot; the following year, still functioning as a collective. Donald Byrd replaced Dorham, and the group recorded an album called simply &quot;The Jazz Messengers&quot; for Columbia Records in 1956. Blakey took over the group name when Silver left after the band&#x27;s first year (taking Mobley and Watkins with him to form a new quintet), and the band name evolved to include Blakey&#x27;s name, eventually settling upon &quot;Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers&quot;. Blakey led the group for the rest of his life.

It was the archetypal hard bop group of the 1950s, playing a driving, aggressive extension of bop with pronounced blues roots. Towards the end of the 1950s, the saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Benny Golson were in turn briefly members of the group. Golson, as musical director, wrote several jazz standards which began as part of the band book, such as &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot;, &quot;Along Came Betty&quot;, and &quot;Blues March&quot;, and were frequently revived by later editions of the group. &quot;Whisper Not&quot; and &quot;Are You Real&quot; were other Golson compositions for Blakey.

From 1959 to 1961, the group featured Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone, Lee Morgan on trumpet, pianist Bobby Timmons and Jymie Merritt on bass. The group recorded several albums for Blue Note Records including &quot;The Big Beat&quot; and &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;. From 1961 to 1964, the band was a sextet that added trombonist Curtis Fuller and replaced Morgan, Timmons, and Merritt with Freddie Hubbard, Cedar Walton, and Reggie Workman, respectively. The group evolved into a proving ground for young jazz talent, and recorded albums such as &quot;Buhaina&#x27;s Delight, Caravan,&quot; and &quot;Free For All&quot;. While veterans occasionally reappeared in the group, by and large, each iteration of the Messengers included a lineup of new young players. Having the Messengers on one&#x27;s resume was a rite of passage in the jazz world and conveyed immediate bona fides.

Many Messenger alumni went on to become jazz stars in their own right, such as: Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Timmons, Curtis Fuller, Chuck Mangione, Keith Jarrett, Joanne Brackeen, Woody Shaw, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison and Mulgrew Miller. For a complete list of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers alumni, including some who did not actually record with the band, see &quot;The Jazz Messengers&quot;.

===Later career===

Blakey went on to record dozens of albums with a constantly changing group of Jazz Messengers. He had a policy of encouraging young musicians: as he remarked on-mic during the live session which resulted in the &quot;A Night at Birdland&quot; albums in 1954: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna stay with the youngsters. When these get too old I&#x27;ll get some younger ones. Keeps the mind active.&quot; After weathering the fusion era in the 1970s, the popularity of the Jazz Messengers faded away. But Blakey&#x27;s band continued performing with new jazz men such as Terence Blanchard and Kenny Garrett.

He continued performing and touring with the group through the end of the 1980s. Ralph Peterson, Jr. joined in 1983 as a second drummer due to Blakey&#x27;s failing health. Ron Wynn notes that Blakey had &quot;played with such force and fury that he eventually lost much of his hearing, and at the end of his life, often played strictly by instinct.&quot; He stubbornly refused to wear a hearing aid, arguing that it threw his timing off, so most of the time he played by sensing vibrations. Javon Jackson, who played in Blakey&#x27;s final lineup, claimed that he exaggerated the extent of his hearing loss. &quot;In my opinion, his deafness was a little exaggerated, and it was exaggerated by him. He didn&#x27;t hear well out of one ear, but he could hear just fine out the other one. He could hear you just fine when you played something badly and he was quick to say &#x27;Hey, you missed that there.&#x27; But anything like &#x27;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be available for the next gig&#x27;, he&#x27;d say &#x27;Huh? I can&#x27;t hear you. Another bandmate, Geoffrey Keezer, claimed that &#x27;He was selectively deaf. He&#x27;d go deaf when you asked him about money, but if it was real quiet and you talked to him one-on-one, then he could hear you just fine.&#x27;&quot;

Blakey&#x27;s final performances were in July 1990.

==Music style==
===Drumming style===
Blakey assumed an aggressive swing style of contemporaries Chick Webb, Sid Catlett and Ray Bauduc early in his career, and is known, alongside Kenny Clarke and Max Roach, as one of the inventors of the modern bebop style of drumming. Max Roach described him thus: His drumming form made continuing use of the traditional grip, though in later appearances he is also seen using a matched grip. In a 1973 drum battle with Ginger Baker he can be seen repeatedly changing grip during his performance.

As the supporting materials for Ken Burns&#x27;s series &quot;Jazz&quot; notes, &quot;Blakey is a major figure in modern jazz and an important stylist in drums. From his earliest recording sessions with Eckstine, and particularly in his historic sessions with Monk in 1947, he exudes power and originality, creating a dark cymbal sound punctuated by frequent loud snare and bass drum accents in triplets or cross-rhythms.&quot; This source continues:
==Legacy==
The legacy of Blakey and his bands is not only the music they produced, but also the opportunities they provided for several generations of jazz musicians. 

The Jazz Messengers nurtured and influenced many of the key figures of the hard bop movement of the late 1950s to early 1960s, and of the Neotraditionalist movement of the 1980s and 1990s, both of which had the Jazz Messengers in a stylistically seminal role. In the words of drummer Cindy Blackman shortly after Blakey&#x27;s death, &quot;When jazz was in danger of dying out [during the 1970s], there was still a scene. Art kept it going.&quot; Blakey was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame (in 1982), the Grammy Hall of Fame (in 2001), and was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

Japanese video game music composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who composed the &quot;Chrono&quot; and &quot;Xeno&quot; video game soundtracks, cited Art Blakey as the jazz musician who had the deepest influence on him, due to his father frequently playing his music.

==Personal life==
In addition to his musical interests, Blakey was described by Jerry &quot;Tiger&quot; Pearson as a storyteller, as having a &quot;big appetite for music [...] women [and] food&quot;, and an interest in the sport of boxing.

Blakey married four times and had other long-lasting relationships throughout his life. He married his first wife, Clarice Stewart, while yet a teen, then Diana Bates (1956), Atsuko Nakamura (1968), and Anne Arnold (1983). He had 10 children from these relationships — Gwendolyn, Evelyn, Jackie, Kadijah, Sakeena, Akira, Art Jr., Takashi, Kenji and Gamal. Sandy Warren, another longtime companion of Blakey, published a book of reminiscences and favorite food recipes from the period of the late 1970s to early 1980s when Blakey lived in Northfield, New Jersey, with Warren and their son, Takashi.

Blakey traveled for a year in West Africa in 1948 to explore the culture and religion of Islam, which he later adopted alongside changing his name; his conversion took place in the late 1940s at a time when other African Americans were being influenced by the Ahmadi missionary Kahili Ahmed Nasir, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History&quot;, and at one time in that period, Blakey led a turbaned, Qur&#x27;an-reading jazz band called the 17 Messengers (perhaps all Muslim, reflecting notions of the Prophet&#x27;s and music&#x27;s roles as conduits of the divine message). A friend recollects that when &quot;Art took up the religion [...] he did so on his own terms&quot;, saying that &quot;Muslim imams would come over to his place, and they would pray and talk, then a few hours later [we] would go [...] to a restaurant [...and] have a drink and order some ribs&quot;, and suggests that reasons for the name change included the pragmatic: that &quot;like many other black jazz musicians who adopted Muslim names&quot;, musicians did so to allow themselves to &quot;check into hotels and enter &#x27;white only places&#x27; under the assumption they were not African-American&quot;.

Drummer Keith Hollis, reflecting on Blakey&#x27;s early life, states that his fellow drummer &quot;wound up doing drugs to cope&quot;; like many of the era, Blakey and his bands were known for their drug use (namely heroin) while traveling and performing (with varying accounts of Blakey&#x27;s influence on others in this regard). 

Other specific recollections have Blakey forswearing serious drink while playing (after being disciplined by drummer Sid Catlett early in his career for drinking while performing), and suggest that the influence of &quot;clean-living cat&quot; Wynton Marsalis led to a period where he was less affected by drugs during performances. Blakey was a heavy smoker; he appears in a cloud of smoke on the &quot;Buhaina&#x27;s Delight&quot; album cover, and in extended footage of a 1973 appearance with Ginger Baker, Blakey begins a long drummers&#x27; &quot;duel&quot; with cigarette alight.

==Death==
Blakey died at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan, on October 16, 1990, from lung cancer. He was survived by nine children: Gwendolyn, Evelyn, Jackie, Sakeena, Kadijah, Akira, Takashi, Gamal, and Kenji.

At his funeral at the Abyssinian Baptist Church on October 22, 1990, a tribute group assembled of past Jazz Messengers including Brian Lynch, Javon Jackson, Geoffrey Keezer, Wynton Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, Valery Ponomarev, Benny Golson, Donald Harrison, Essiet Okon Essiet, and drummer Kenny Washington performed several of the band&#x27;s most celebrated tunes, such as Golson&#x27;s &quot;Along Came Betty&quot;, Bobby Timmons&#x27; &quot;Moanin, and Wayne Shorter&#x27;s &quot;One by One&quot;. Jackson, a member of Blakey&#x27;s last Jazz Messengers group, recalled how his experiences with the drummer changed his life, saying that &quot;He taught me how to be a man. How to stand up and be accounted for&quot;. Musicians Jackie McLean, Ray Bryant, Dizzy Gillespie, and Max Roach also paid tribute to Blakey at his funeral.

<doc id="243659" wikidata="Q1519901" url="?curid=243659" title="Chaperone (social)">
<text>A chaperone (also spelled chaperon) in its original social usage was a person who for propriety&#x27;s sake accompanied an unmarried girl in public; usually she was an older married woman, and most commonly the girl&#x27;s own mother.

In modern social usage, a chaperon (frequent in British spelling) or chaperone (usual in American spelling) is a responsible adult who accompanies and supervises young people. By extension, the word chaperone is used in clinical contexts.

==Origin==
The word derives figuratively from the French word &quot;chaperon&quot; (originally from the Late Latin &quot;cappa&quot;, meaning &quot;cape&quot;), which referred to a hood that was worn by individuals generally. A chaperone was part of the costume of the Knights of the Garter when they were in full dress and, probably, since the Knights were court attendants, the word &quot;chaperon&quot; changed to mean escort. An alternative explanation comes from the sport of falconry, where the word meant the hood placed over the head of a bird of prey to stop its desire to fly. 

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the noun (in its figurative sense of escort of females) is attested from 1721, and the verb &#x27;to chaperon&#x27; from 1811.

==Traditional institution==
Although the supervision of vulnerable women in public spaces may be common in many cultures, the specific word &quot;chaperon&quot; began to be used in the eighteenth century to denote a particular social institution, namely, a woman who would accompany a young unmarried woman in public, and especially where she might be expected to meet a man. In circumstances where, for whatever reason, the mother was unavailable to perform this function, another woman, usually well known to the family, was chosen. A chaperon was usually expected to be a married woman, although a respected, older unmarried or widowed woman (typically someone beyond child-bearing age) was often acceptable.

Chaperones were usually not required in situations where an unmarried woman&#x27;s father was able to accompany his daughter(s). Chaperones for young men were not commonly employed in Western society until the latter half of the 20th century, although depending on the precise nature of the business he was on, a young male who temporarily left the company of his parents would usually find himself under the supervision of coaches, employers or other such individuals (such personnel were not typically seen to be chaperones in the traditional sense).

==Duenna==
English-speaking cultures supposed, perhaps correctly, that the institution was particularly strict in southern Europe, especially in Spain, to which they attributed the word &quot;&quot;, an Old Spanish spelling (ñ arose as a ligature of &quot;nn&quot;; the tilde was shorthand for the second &quot;n&quot;, written over the first) of the modern Spanish word &quot;dueña&quot;. By an extended usage the word &quot;duenna&quot; has come to mean a young woman&#x27;s female companion from any culture, particularly one who is exceedingly strict. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; instances &quot;There is no duenna so rigidly prudent as ... a superannuated coquette&quot;, and even any disapproving person irrespective of gender (where it instances &quot;He drew his lips together in that duenna-like way&quot;).

==Current usage==
Chaperones were expected to exercise stern authority over their charges; this, combined with the fact that young people typically had little or no say in the choice of a chaperone, could lead to resistance and resentment on the part of the young people being supervised. One particular effect of the perceived need for the chaperoning of young women was that the early development of women&#x27;s sport, already impaired by a reluctance on the part of society to accept the presence of females in organized sports, was further inhibited for several decades due to the extra costs involved in hiring chaperones.

The practice of one-on-one chaperones for social occasions has largely fallen out of use in Western society. Today, the term is most often applied to parents and teachers who supervise groups of young people (often of mixed genders) at school dances, sporting events, field trips and other such events. Often, for short trips where adults are required to perform other functions (such as coaching) these adults will be expected to perform chaperoning duties as well. This practice both saves money and has the potential to foster a better relationship between young people and the adults chaperoning them.

A major drawback of such an arrangement is that the adults involved are often hired for other reasons besides their qualifications to supervise children and adolescents. There is, therefore, the potential that such adults may be presented an opportunity to engage in physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse of their charges. Therefore, in present-day situations where young people plan to be away from their families for an extended period of time, such as modern-day cinema, theatre and television productions where the cast includes children as well as other areas such as high-level sport or modeling, there is often a legal obligation to have a staff role of a chaperone, responsible for their general safety and well-being while away from their parents. Chaperones must be qualified in specialist childcare areas such as pediatric first aid, child protection, and all required reporting and workforce requirements.

==In culture==
Richard Sheridan&#x27;s 18 century play &quot;The Duenna&quot; was used for libretto of two operas: his contemporary Thomas Linley the Younger&#x27;s work of the same title and in 20 century by Russian composer Sergey Prokofiev in his Betrothal in a Monastery.

The plot of Brandon Thomas&#x27;s 1892 farce play &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; revolves around the need for a chaperone.

E. M. Forster&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;A Room with a View&quot; features a character, Charlotte Bartlett, who functions as a chaperone for her younger cousin Lucy Honeychurch.

In Fazil Iskander&#x27;s book &quot;The Gospel According to Chegem&quot; (1984), the chapter &quot;Harlampo and Despina&quot; tells about a couple who spent over seven years engaged. Whenever Despina visited Harlampo, her aunt, Chrysoula, accompanied her, constantly giving instructions on proper behavior and watching out that the relationship isn&#x27;t consummated prematurely.

The 2006 musical spoof &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; centers upon an unnamed, alcoholic chaperone to the bride-to-be, Janet Van de Graaff.

<doc id="243661" wikidata="Q1264513" url="?curid=243661" title="Duke of Buckingham">
<text>Duke of Buckingham, referring to Buckingham, is an extinct title that has been created several times in the peerages of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom. There were creations of double dukedoms of Buckingham and Normanby and of Buckingham and Chandos. The last holder of the dukedom died in 1889.

There have also been Earls of Buckingham and Marquesses of Buckingham.

==History==

===Dukes of Buckingham, first creation (1444)===
The first creation of the dukedom was on 14 September 1444, when Humphrey Stafford was made Duke of Buckingham.

On his father&#x27;s side, Stafford was descended from Edmund de Stafford, who had been summoned to Parliament as Lord Stafford in 1299. The second Baron had been created Earl of Stafford in 1351. On his mother&#x27;s side, Stafford was the son of Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Buckingham, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham (later Duke of Gloucester), youngest son of King Edward III of England. Stafford was an important supporter of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, and was killed at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460.

The 1st Duke of Buckingham was succeeded by his grandson, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who aided Richard III in his claiming the throne in 1483, but who then led a revolt against Richard and was executed later that same year. His titles were forfeited along with the dukedom.

His son, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was restored to the title upon Henry VII&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1485, but he was ultimately executed for treason in 1521 due to his opposition to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII&#x27;s chief advisor. At this time the title became extinct; it was posthumously attainted in 1523.

===Dukes of Buckingham, second creation (1623)===

The second creation of the dukedom was in 1623 for George Villiers, a favourite of James I of England. He had previously been made &quot;Baron Whaddon&quot;, of Whaddon in the County of Buckingham, and &quot;Viscount Villiers&quot; in 1616, then &quot;Earl of Buckingham&quot; in 1617, then &quot;Marquess of Buckingham&quot; in 1618 until he was also created &quot;Earl of Coventry&quot; and &quot;Duke of Buckingham&quot; in 1623. Buckingham, who continued in office as chief minister into the reign of James&#x27;s son, Charles I, was responsible for a policy of war against Spain and France. In 1628, he was assassinated by John Felton, a disgruntled army officer who had served under him, as he prepared an expedition to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle.

His son, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, was a notable advisor in the reign of Charles II, and along with Lord Ashley made up the Protestant axis of the famous Cabal Ministry. He started the first foxhunt in England, the Bilsdale Hunt, in 1668, and later started the Sinnington Hunt in 1680. After digging for a fox above Kirkbymoorside, and being too far from his home in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, he died from a chill in the house of a tenant. With his death in 1687, the title again became extinct.

Several other members of the Villiers family have been elevated to the peerage. Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey, and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, were brothers of the first Duke of Buckingham. Also, Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey, was the great-nephew of the first Duke of Buckingham while Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon, was the second son of the second Earl of Jersey.

===Dukes of Buckingham, third creation (1703)===
The third creation of the dukedom, as &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Normanby&quot;, was in 1703 for John Sheffield, 3rd Earl of Mulgrave, 1st Marquess of Normanby, a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. The dukedom was created in the Peerage of England. The full title was &quot;Duke of the County of Buckingham and of Normanby&quot; but in practice only &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Normanby&quot; was used. The duke&#x27;s family descended from Sir Edmund Sheffield, second cousin of Henry VIII, who in 1547 was raised to the Peerage of England as &quot;Baron Sheffield&quot; and in 1549 was killed in the streets of Norwich during Kett&#x27;s Rebellion.

On the death of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1735, the titles became extinct. The Sheffield family estates passed to the 2nd Duke&#x27;s half-brother Charles Herbert Sheffield, the illegitimate son of the 1st Duke by Frances Stewart. He was created a Baronet in 1755 and is the ancestor of the Sheffield Baronets, of Normanby.

The seat of the family was Buckingham House, until it was bought by King George III in 1761.

===Dukes of Buckingham, fourth creation (1822)===

The fourth creation of the dukedom, as &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Chandos&quot; in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, was in 1822 for Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, a landowner and politician.

He was the son of George Nugent Temple Grenville, 3rd Earl Temple, who was the son of Prime Minister George Grenville, and who had been created &quot;Marquess of Buckingham&quot; in the peerage of Great Britain in 1784. The 1st Marquess of Buckingham had married Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent. Mary was in 1800 created Baroness Nugent in her own right in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to her second son George (see the Baron Nugent). In 1788 Lord Buckingham also succeeded his father-in-law as second Earl Nugent according to a special remainder in the letters patent, and at the same time assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Nugent.

After the 1st Marquess of Buckingham&#x27;s death in 1813, his titles passed to his son Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham. He married Lady Anne Eliza Brydges, the only child of James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos (a title which became extinct on his death in 1789), and assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Brydges-Chandos in 1799. In 1822 Lord Buckingham was created &quot;Earl Temple of Stowe&quot;, in the County of Buckingham, &quot;Marquess of Chandos&quot; and &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Chandos&quot;, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The earldom was created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to (1) the heirs male of the body of his deceased great-grandmother Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple, and (2) in default thereof to his granddaughter Lady Anne Eliza Mary Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, daughter of his son Richard, who succeeded as second Duke in 1839.

After the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos&#x27; death in 1861, the titles passed to his son, the third Duke. He was also a prominent politician and served as Lord President of the Council and as Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1868 the Duke established his right to the Scottish lordship of Kinloss before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. On his death in 1889 without male issue, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles (the marquessate of Buckingham, marquessate of Chandos, earldom of Temple and earldom of Nugent) became extinct. The lordship of Kinloss passed to his daughter Mary. The earldom of Temple of Stowe passed to his sister&#x27;s son William Temple-Gore-Langton because the title had been created with a special remainder to her heirs male. The viscountcy of Cobham, which had also been created with a special remainder, passed to Charles Lyttelton, 5th Baron Lyttelton, a descendant of Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple&#x27;s sister Christian, who had married Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet.

<text>Rail Baron is a railroad board game for 3 to 6 players.

&quot;Rail Baron&quot; was initially published in the 1970s under the name &quot;Boxcars&quot; by the original designers R.S. Erickson and T.F. Erickson, Jr. It was soon acquired, renamed and reissued by Avalon Hill.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Rail Baron&quot; is played on a map of the United States on which the routes of 28 historic railroads, such as the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Southern Pacific have been marked. The map is divided into seven regions, Northeast, Southeast, North Central, South Central, Plains, Northwest and Southwest. Major US cities which are connected by the railroads act as destinations for travel. Dots on the railroad routes represent small towns along the way, and serve as distance markers for player movement.

The goal of each player is to accumulate money by moving his or her train token to map destinations which are generated at random via a lookup table. Large cities like New York and Chicago are more likely to be generated as destinations than small cities. Travel from one destination to the next is accomplished by rolling dice to determine distance that can be moved. Players then move their train token along map dots toward their destination.

Upon arrival at a destination, the player collects a cash payoff, and may use the money to upgrade his or her train engine to a faster model, or purchase a railroad. Railroad purchases are key to the game because an owner collects substantial fees from other players who ride his or her railroad during their movement. Meanwhile, the owner can ride his or her own railroads at no cost. Thus, an important decision in the game is whether to buy a variety of railroads in order to gain access to all areas of the map for oneself, or to buy railroads in a given area in order to monopolize it and collect the valuable use fees from opponents.

===Winning===
To win the game a player must accumulate $200,000 and then make a daring run back to their home city (their first city in the game) before any opponent can catch them via what is known as a rover play.

==Railroads==
The 28 railroads depicted in the game correspond to 28 actual real-life railroads that operated in the early 20th century. The table below lists these 28 railroads, their cost within the Rail Baron game, their real-life years of operation and eventual corporate outcome, and their current status as of 2009.

¹ = As of September, 2009

==Variants==
Several variants are gaining in popularity. The &quot;Home Swap&quot; lets players switch the home city and first destination before moving for the first time in case their first destination is an easily monopolizable one, or if they want to try to get a better home city. &quot;Free Superchief&quot; lets players upgrade to a SuperChief engine at no cost if they already have an Express engine; this both speeds the game and lessens the dominance of the Pennsylvania RR.

Fans of the game have created dozens of alternate maps for play. There now exist game maps of Europe, New York City, Colorado, and many other locations, as well as fictional regions. There is also a computer version which both speeds play and supports online multiplayer matches.

<doc id="243665" wikidata="Q300588" url="?curid=243665" title="A Theory of Justice">
<text>A Theory of Justice is a 1971 work of political philosophy and ethics by the philosopher John Rawls (1921–2002) in which the author attempts to provide a moral theory alternative to utilitarianism and that addresses the problem of distributive justice (the socially just distribution of goods in a society).
The theory uses an updated form of Kantian philosophy and a variant form of conventional social contract theory. Rawls&#x27;s theory of justice is fully a political theory of justice as opposed to other forms of justice discussed in other disciplines and contexts.

The resultant theory was challenged and refined several times in the decades following its original publication in 1971. A significant reappraisal was published in the 1985 essay &quot;Justice as Fairness&quot; and the 2001 book &quot;Justice as Fairness: A Restatement&quot; in which Rawls further developed his two central principles for his discussion of justice. Together, they dictate that society should be structured so that the greatest possible amount of liberty is given to its members, limited only by the notion that the liberty of any one member shall not infringe upon that of any other member. Secondly, inequalities – either social or economic – are only to be allowed if the worst off will be better off than they might be under an equal distribution. Finally, if there is such a beneficial inequality, this inequality should not make it harder for those without resources to occupy positions of power – for instance, public office.

==Objective==
In &quot;A Theory of Justice,&quot; Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s views. Principles of justice are sought to guide the conduct of the parties. These parties are recognized to face moderate scarcity, and they are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic. They have ends which they seek to advance but prefer to advance them through cooperation with others on mutually acceptable terms. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and right-wing libertarian accounts.

==The &quot;original position&quot;==

Rawls belongs to the social contract tradition, although he takes a different view from that of previous thinkers. Specifically, Rawls develops what he claims are principles of justice through the use of an artificial device or thought experiment he calls the &quot;Original position&quot;; in which, everyone decides principles of justice from behind a veil of ignorance. This &quot;veil&quot; is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage:

: [N]o one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance.

According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the &quot;Original Position&quot; would all adopt a maximin strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off:

: They are the principles that rational and free persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamentals of the terms of their association.

Rawls bases his &quot;Original Position&quot; on a &quot;thin theory of the good&quot; which he says &quot;explains the rationality underlying choice of principles in the Original Position&quot;. A full theory of the good follows after we derive principles from the original position. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two such principles, which would then govern the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The difference principle permits inequalities in the distribution of goods only if those inequalities benefit the worst-off members of society. Rawls believes that this principle would be a rational choice for the representatives in the original position for the following reason: Each member of society has an equal claim on their society&#x27;s goods. Natural attributes should not affect this claim, so the basic right of any individual, before further considerations are taken into account, must be to an equal share in material wealth. What, then, could justify unequal distribution? Rawls argues that inequality is acceptable only if it is to the advantage of those who are worst-off.

The agreement that stems from the original position is both &quot;hypothetical&quot; and &quot;ahistorical&quot;. It is hypothetical in the sense that the principles to be derived are what the parties would, under certain legitimating conditions, agree to, not what they have agreed to. Rawls seeks to use an argument that the principles of justice are what &quot;would&quot; be agreed upon if people were in the hypothetical situation of the original position and that those principles have moral weight as a result of that. It is ahistorical in the sense that it is not supposed that the agreement has ever been, or indeed could ever have been, derived in the real world outside of carefully limited experimental exercises.

== The principles of justice ==
Rawls modifies and develops the principles of justice throughout his book. In chapter forty-six, Rawls makes his final clarification on the two principles of justice:1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.

2. Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both:

:(a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and 
:(b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.The first principle is often called the &quot;greatest equal liberty principle&quot;. Part (a) of the second principle is referred to as the &quot;difference principle&quot; while part (b) is referred to as the &quot;equal opportunity principle.&quot;

Rawls orders the principles of justice lexically, as follows: 1, 2b, 2a. The &quot;greatest equal liberty principle&quot; takes priority, followed by the &quot;equal opportunity principle&quot; and finally the &quot;difference principle&quot;. The first principle must be satisfied before 2b, and 2b must be satisfied before 2a. As Rawls states: &quot;A principle does not come into play until those previous to it are either fully met or do not apply.&quot; Therefore, the equal basic liberties protected in the first principle cannot be traded or sacrificed for greater social advantages (granted by 2(b)) or greater economic advantages (granted by 2a).

=== The greatest equal liberty principle ===

: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all (1).

The &quot;greatest equal liberty principle&quot; is mainly concerned with the distribution of rights and liberties. Rawls identifies the following equal basic liberties: &quot;political liberty (the right to vote and hold public office) and freedom of speech and assembly; liberty of conscience and freedom of thought; freedom of the person, which includes freedom from psychological oppression and physical assault and dismemberment (integrity of the person); the right to hold personal property and freedom from arbitrary arrest and seizure as defined by the concept of the rule of law.&quot;

It is a matter of some debate whether freedom of contract can be inferred to be included among these basic liberties: &quot;liberties not on the list, for example, the right to own certain kinds of property and freedom of contract as understood by the doctrine of laissez-faire are not basic; and so they are not protected by the priority of the first principle.&quot;.

=== The difference principle ===

:Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle (2a).

Rawls&#x27; claim in (a) is that departures from equality of a list of what he calls primary goods—&quot;things which a rational man wants whatever else he wants&quot; are justified only to the extent that they improve the lot of those who are worst-off under that distribution in comparison with the previous, equal, distribution. His position is at least in some sense egalitarian, with a provision that inequalities are allowed when they benefit the least advantaged. An important consequence of Rawls&#x27; view is that inequalities can actually be just, as long as they are to the benefit of the least well off. His argument for this position rests heavily on the claim that morally arbitrary factors (for example, the family one is born into) should not determine one&#x27;s life chances or opportunities. Rawls is also oriented to an intuition that a person does not morally deserve their inborn talents; thus, that one is not entitled to all the benefits they could possibly receive from them; hence, at least one of the criteria which could provide an alternative to equality in assessing the justice of distributions is eliminated.

Further, the just savings principle requires that some sort of material respect is left for future generations. Although Rawls is ambiguous about what this means, it can generally be understood as &quot;a contribution to those coming later&quot;.

=== The equal opportunity principle ===
:Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity (2b).

The stipulation in 2b is lexically prior to that in 2a. This is because &quot;equal opportunity&quot; requires not merely that offices and positions are distributed on the basis of merit, but that all have reasonable opportunity to acquire the skills on the basis of which merit is assessed, even if one might not have the necessary material resources - due to a beneficial inequality stemming from the difference principle.

It may be thought that this stipulation, and even the first principle of justice, may require greater equality than the difference principle, because large social and economic inequalities, even when they are to the advantage of the worst-off, will tend to seriously undermine the value of the political liberties and any measures towards fair equality of opportunity.

==Influence and reception==
In 1972, &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; by Marshall Cohen, who described the work as &quot;magisterial,&quot; and suggested that Rawls&#x27; use of the techniques of analytic philosophy made the book the &quot;most formidable&quot; defense of the social contract tradition to date. He credited Rawls with showing that the widespread claim that &quot;systematic moral and political philosophy are dead&quot; is mistaken, and with providing a &quot;bold and rigorous&quot; account of &quot;the principles to which our public life is committed.&quot; Though he suggested that it might take years before a satisfactory appraisal of the work could be made, he noted that Rawls&#x27; accomplishments had been compared by scholars to those of John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant. However, he criticized Rawls for &quot;looseness in his understanding of some fundamental political concepts.&quot;

&quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; received criticism from several philosophers. Robert Nozick criticized Rawls&#x27; account of distributive justice in his defense of libertarianism, &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974). Allan Bloom, writing in &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; in 1975, noted that &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; had &quot;attracted more attention in the Anglo-Saxon world than any work of its kind in a generation&quot;, attributing its popularity to its being &quot;the most ambitious political project undertaken by a member of the school currently dominant in academic philosophy&quot; and to Rawls’s &quot;radical egalitarian interpretation of liberal democracy.&quot; Bloom criticized Rawls for failing to account for the existence of natural right in his theory of justice and wrote that Rawls absolutizes social union as the ultimate goal which would conventionalize everything into artifice. Robert Paul Wolff criticized Rawls from a Marxist perspective in &quot;Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice&quot; (1977), arguing Rawls offers an apology for the status quo insofar as he constructs justice from existing practice and forecloses the possibility that there may be problems of injustice embedded in capitalist social relations, private property or the market economy.

Michael Sandel criticized Rawls in &quot;Liberalism and the Limits of Justice&quot; (1982), arguing that Rawls encourages people to think about justice while divorced from the values and aspirations that define who they are as persons and that allow people to determine what justice is. Susan Moller Okin wrote in &quot;Justice, Gender, and the Family&quot; (1989) that Rawls had provided &quot;the most influential of all twentieth-century theories of justice&quot;, but criticized him for failing to account for the injustices and hierarchies embedded in familial relations. Economists Kenneth Arrow and John Harsanyi criticized the assumptions of the original position, and in particular, the use of maximin reasoning, with the implication that Rawls&#x27; selection of parameters for the original position was result-oriented, &quot;i.e.&quot;, calculated to derive the two principles that Rawls desired to advance, and/or, as the &quot;contractarian critique&quot; holds, that the persons in the original position articulated by Rawls would not in fact select the principles that &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; advocates. In reply Rawls emphasized the role of the original position as a &quot;device of representation&quot; for making sense of the idea of a fair choice situation for free and equal citizens, and that the relatively modest role that maximin plays in his argument: it is &quot;a useful heuristic rule of thumb&quot; given the curious features of choice behind the veil of ignorance.

In his book &quot;Black Rights / White Wrongs&quot;, philosopher Charles W. Mills critiques the underlying assumptions of Rawls’s work as inherently white, and thus subject to glaring blind spots. Mills sets “the white fantasy world of Rawlsianism” and its “ideal theory” against the actual history of racialized oppression in the modern era, and proposes that non-ideal theory is urgently needed to address racial inequality and possible remediations. “Here is a huge body of work,&quot; Mills writes on Rawls&#x27;s output, &quot;focused on questions of social justice – seemingly the natural place to look for guidance on normative issues related to race – which has nothing to say about racial justice, the distinctive injustice of the modern world.” Mills documents a “pattern of silence” in Rawls’s work, and, through the lens of Radical Black Kantianism, situates that within a broader tradition of white political philosophers either being explicitly racist, or ignoring race in discussions of justice.

The economist Amartya Sen has raised concerns over Rawls&#x27; emphasis on primary social goods, arguing in &quot;Inequality Reexamined&quot; (1992) that we should attend not only to the distribution of primary goods, but also how effectively people are able to use those goods to pursue their ends. Norman Daniels has wondered why health care should not be treated as a primary good, and some of his subsequent work has addressed this question, arguing for a right to health care within a broadly Rawlsian framework. The philosopher G. A. Cohen, in &quot;If You&#x27;re An Egalitarian, How Come You&#x27;re So Rich?&quot; (2000) and &quot;Rescuing Justice and Equality&quot; (2008), criticizes Rawls&#x27; avowal of inequality under the difference principle, his application of the principle only to social institutions, and what he sees as Rawls&#x27;s obsession with using primary goods as his currency of equality.

Sen critiques and attempts to revitalize &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in &quot;The Idea of Justice&quot; (2009). He credits Rawls for revitalizing the interest in the ideas of what justice means and the stress put on fairness, objectivity, equality of opportunity, removal of poverty, and freedom. However, Sen, as part of his general critique of the contractarian tradition, states that ideas about a perfectly just world do not help redress actual existing inequality. Sen faults Rawls for overemphasizing institutions as guarantors of justice and not considering the effects of human behaviour on the institutions&#x27; ability to maintain a just society. Sen believes Rawls understates the difficulty in getting everyone in society to adhere to the norms of a just society. He also claims that Rawls&#x27; position that there be only one possible outcome of the reflective equilibrium behind the veil of ignorance is misguided. In contrast to Rawls, Sen believes that multiple conflicting, yet just, principles may arise and that this undermines the multistep processes that Rawls laid out as leading to a perfectly just society.

==In popular culture==
&quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; inspired a 2013 musical, &quot;A Theory of Justice: The Musical!&quot;, written and produced by Eylon Aslan-Levy, Ramin Sabi, Tommy Peto, and Toby Huelin.

<text>Every Major League Baseball (MLB) season, one American League (AL) team wins the pennant, signifying that they are the league&#x27;s champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League (NL). The pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the AL Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players&#x27; strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current AL pennant holders are the New York Yankees, who beat the Cleveland Guardians for the pennant on October 19, 2024.

In 1969, the AL split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the five-game ALCS to determine the pennant winner, who received (and continues to receive) the William Harridge Trophy. The trophy featured a golden eagle, the league&#x27;s emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and clutching the AL banner. Since 2017, the trophy is all silver with a pennant on top. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The format of the ALCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when MLB restructured into three divisions in each league. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as the three AL Wild Card winners, play in the AL Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play in the ALCS. AL pennant winners have gone on to win the World Series 68 times, most recently in 2023.

The New York Yankees have won 41 AL pennants, winning their first in 1921 and their most recent in 2024. This total is more than twice that of the next-closest team, the Oakland Athletics, who have won 15. They are followed by the Boston Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers, with 14 and 11 pennants won respectively. The Yankees have the most pennants since the introduction of the ALCS in 1969 with 11, followed by the Athletics, Red Sox, and the Baltimore Orioles with 6, 6, and 5 respectively. The Yankees also hold the record for most wins by a pennant-winning team, with their 1998 team winning 114 out of 162 games, finishing 22 games ahead of the Boston Red Sox. The 1954 Cleveland Indians won the most games of any pennant winner under the pre-1969 system, winning 111 out of their 154 games and finishing eight games ahead of the Yankees. The Milwaukee Brewers won the AL pennant in 1982 but later moved to the NL starting in the 1998 season.

The only current MLB franchise to have never won a league pennant—and therefore, to have never appeared in the World Series—is the Seattle Mariners.

;Notes
* A mid-season labor stoppage split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half in each division in the 1981 American League Division Series. The winners played in the 1981 ALCS for the American League pennant.
* The leagues were re-aligned in 1994 to three divisions and a wild card was added to the playoffs, but the labor stoppage cancelled the postseason. Wild cards were first used in the 1995 playoffs.
* While Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was the official name of the team, the team was commonly referred to simply as &quot;Los Angeles Angels&quot;, which they changed back to in 2016.

<doc id="243669" wikidata="Q781258" url="?curid=243669" title="Australia II">
<text>Australia II (KA 6) is an Australian 12-metre-class America&#x27;s Cup challenge racing yacht that was launched in 1982 and won the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup for the Royal Perth Yacht Club. Skippered by John Bertrand, she was the first successful Cup challenger, ending a 132-year tenure (with 26 successful defences) by the New York Yacht Club.

==Design==
&quot;Australia II&quot; was designed by Ben Lexcen, built by Steve Ward, owned by Alan Bond and skippered by John Bertrand. Lexcen&#x27;s &quot;Australia II&quot; design featured a reduced waterline length and a short chord winged keel which gave the boat a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and heeling moment (lower ballast centre of gravity) but it was a significant disadvantage in choppy seas. The boat was also very quick in stays. The winged keel was a major design advance, and its legality was questioned by the New York Yacht Club. During the summer of 1983, as selection trials took place for the Cup defence that autumn, the New York Yacht Club challenged the legality of the keel design. The controversy was decided in &quot;Australia II&quot;″s favour.

&quot;Australia II&quot; sported a number of other innovative features that contributed to her success, including radical vertical sail designs, all-kevlar running rigging and a lightweight carbon fibre boom.

===Later claims of Dutch design===
In 2009, more than two decades after Ben Lexcen&#x27;s death, Dutch naval architect Peter van Oossanen claimed that the winged keel was actually designed by him and his group of Dutch designers, and not Lexcen. If true, this would have been reason to disqualify &quot;Australia II&quot;, since the rules then stated that challenging yachts were to be designed only by citizens of the nations they represented.

The controversy arose due to Cup rules allowing designers to use model basins for testing that were not located in the challenging country. Model testing was performed in the Netherlands and Peter van Oossanen and another Dutch engineer, Joop Sloof, performed measurements and analyses related to evaluation of winged keel designs.

The suggestion that the vessel was not designed by Australians has been refuted by both Bertrand and project manager John Longley. Furthermore, it is well established that Lexcen had been experimenting with wing adaptations to the undersurface appendages of boats before, including his 1958 skiffs &quot;Taipan&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot;, although in the latter application they were not determined to be effective and not further adopted.

In 1983, Lexcen commented on the design issue: &quot;I have in mind to admit it all to the New York Yacht Club that I really owe the secret of the design to a Greek guy who helped me out and was invaluable. He&#x27;s been dead for 2000 years. Bloody Archimedes...&quot;

In May 2024 after the release of the Netflix TV documentary &#x27;Untold: The Race Of The Century&#x27; (2020), the Journal of Science Engineering Ethics published a paper claiming that Ben Lexcen should not have been named as the inventor or designer.

&quot;Australia II&quot; dominated the 1983 Louis Vuitton Cup before defeating &quot;Azzurra&quot; in the semi-finals and &quot;Victory ″83&quot; in the final to win the trophy and earn the right to challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup.

===America&#x27;s Cup===

Australia II, bearing sail number KA6, represented the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia in its September 1983 challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup. The defender, the New York Yacht Club, had held the cup since 1851, dominating challengers and sustaining the longest winning streak in sport.

&quot;Australia II&quot;, skippered by John Bertrand, faced Dennis Conner sailing the 12-metre &quot;Liberty&quot; in the ocean off Newport, Rhode Island. &quot;Australia II&quot; came from behind to prevail 4 races to 3. The victory on 26 September 1983 was a landmark event for the nation of Australia, not to mention the Royal Perth Yacht Club. The achievement was underscored when &quot;Australia II&quot; was awarded the ABC &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; Athlete of the Year for 1983.
The crew of &quot;Australia II&quot; for the America&#x27;s Cup races was John Bertrand (skipper), Will Baillieu, Colin Beashel, Rob Brown, Peter Costello, Damian Fewster, James Hardy (alternate helm), Ken Judge, Skip Lissiman, John Longley, Scott McAllister, Brian Richardson, Phil Smidmore, Grant Simmer, and Hugh Treharne. Beashel was an Olympic medal winning sailor who competed at six Olympic games. Richardson was a dual-Olympian oarsman who had stroked the Australian men&#x27;s eight at the Moscow 1980 Olympics and Baillieu had also rowed for Australia, in a coxed four at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

==Popular culture==
The &quot;Boxing Kangaroo&quot; was the official mascot of the &quot;Australia II&quot; effort.

The win was received with much enthusiasm in Australia, with the Men at Work song &quot;Down Under&quot; becoming the official anthem for the crew.

==Retirement==
In the mid-1980s, &quot;Australia II&quot; was sold by Alan Bond to the Australian government. She was lent to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney for display in 1991. In 2000, &quot;Australia II&quot; was removed from the National Maritime Museum and transferred to the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle. For the 150th anniversary celebrations of the America&#x27;s Cup in 2001, she was removed from the museum and shipped to the Isle of Wight, sailing with the original crew for several days of commemorative regattas. &quot;Australia II&quot; was returned to the Western Australian Maritime Museum, where she is on permanent display.

In 2017, the Team of Australia II were among the inaugural inductees to the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="243671" wikidata="Q362544" url="?curid=243671" title="André Bazin">
<text>André Bazin (; 18 April 1918 – 11 November 1958) was a renowned and influential French film critic and film theorist. He started to write about movies in 1943 and was a co-founder of the renowned film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 1951 alongside Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca.

He is notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema. His call for objective reality in film, as understood through the use of deep focus as well as the lack of montage, were linked to his belief that the interpretation of an entire movie or a specific scene should be left to the spectator. This placed him in opposition to prior film theorists, such as many writing during the 1920s and 1930s, who had emphasized how the cinema could manipulate reality. Bazin insisted that movies morally should serve as personalized projects by their directors to the degree that each and every one represents a director&#x27;s individual vision, which reflected his broader psychological and philosophical beliefs about culture and the arts.

Although his death in his forties, occurring in the middle of his writing career, kept him from witnessing the seminal works in the French New Wave period firsthand, Bazin&#x27;s viewpoints exercised a large influence on those filmmakers. For instance, François Truffaut dedicated the movie &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, a work released in May 1959 that has been one of the films regarded as the greatest ever made in European history, to Bazin.

==Life==
André Bazin was born in Angers, France on 18 April 1918. After graduating from the École normale supérieure at Saint-Cloud in 1941, he pursued a career as a teacher, but was denied a teaching post due to his stammer. He then took part in the student organisation &quot;Maison des Lettres&quot; in Paris, where he founded a ciné-club during the German occupation of Paris. Bazin met future film and television producer Janine Kirsch while working at Labour and Culture, a militant organization associated with the French Communist Party during the war. They married in 1949 and had a son named Florent. Bazin was diagnosed with leukemia in 1954. He died at Nogent-sur-Marne on 11 November 1958, at the age of 40.

==Film criticism==
Bazin started to write about film in 1943 and was a co-founder of the renowned film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 1951, along with Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca. Bazin was a major force in post-World War II film studies and criticism. He edited &quot;Cahiers&quot; until his death, and a four-volume collection of his writings was published posthumously, covering the years 1958 to 1962 and titled &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que le cinéma?&quot; (&quot;What is cinema?&quot;).

A selection from &quot;What Is Cinema?&quot; was translated into English and published in two volumes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They became mainstays of film courses in the English-speaking world, but never were updated or revised. In 2009, the Canadian publisher Caboose, taking advantage of more favourable Canadian copyright laws, compiled fresh translations of some of the key essays from the collection in a single-volume edition. With annotations by translator Timothy Barnard, this became the only corrected and annotated edition of these writings in any language. In 2018, this volume was replaced by a more extensive collection of Bazin&#x27;s texts translated by Barnard, &quot;André Bazin: Selected Writings 1943–1958&quot;. A new collection of Bazin&#x27;s essays were released in 2022 under the title &quot;André Bazin on Adaptation: Cinema&#x27;s Literary Imagination&quot;.
The long-held view of Bazin&#x27;s critical system is that he argued for films that depicted &quot;objective reality&quot; (such as documentaries and films of the Italian neorealism school or as he called it &quot;the Italian school of the Liberation&quot;). He advocated the use of deep focus (Orson Welles, William Wyler), wide shots (Jean Renoir) and the &quot;shot-in-depth&quot;, and preferred what he referred to as &quot;true continuity&quot; through &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; over experiments in editing and visual effects. For example, he extensively analyzes a scene in Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (with cinematography by Gregg Toland) to illuminate the function of deep-focus composition:

The concentration on objective reality, deep focus, and lack of montage are linked to Bazin&#x27;s belief that the interpretation of a film or scene should be left to the spectator. This placed him in opposition to film theory of the 1920s and 1930s, which emphasized how the cinema could manipulate reality.

According to Dudley Andrew, Roman Catholicism and Personalism are two strong influences on Bazin&#x27;s outlook of cinema. Victor Bruno says that these influences—especially Roman Catholicism—are the wellspring from which flows the essence of Bazin&#x27;s understanding of &quot;realism,&quot; which, according to him, is more closely linked with metaphysical realism than with corporeality (also called realism by certain scholars).

Another academic, Tom Gunning, identifies yet a third influence on André Bazin: Hegelianism. According to Gunning, Bazin&#x27;s preference for the long take is akin to Hegel&#x27;s understanding of the unfolding of history in time. This idea has been dismissed by certain authors, since Bazin privileged the long take as a means of liberty and Hegel understood that the unfolding of history would conclude in a perfectly systematized paradigm.

At any rate, Bazin&#x27;s personalism led him to believe that a film should represent a director&#x27;s personal vision. This idea had a pivotal importance in the development of the auteur theory, the manifesto for which François Truffaut&#x27;s article &quot;A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema&quot; was published by his mentor Bazin in &quot;Cahiers&quot; in 1954. Bazin also championed directors like Howard Hawks, William Wyler and John Ford.

Jean Renoir famously wrote, looking back in retrospect, that he viewed Bazin as the one who &quot;gave the patent or royalty to the cinema just as the poets of the past had crowned their kings&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*François Truffaut dedicated &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; to Bazin, who died one day after shooting began on the film.
*Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Waking Life&quot; features a discussion between filmmaker Caveh Zahedi and poet David Jewell regarding some of Bazin&#x27;s film theories. There is an emphasis on Bazin&#x27;s Christianity and the belief that every shot is a representation of God manifested in creation.

<doc id="243674" wikidata="Q495442" url="?curid=243674" title="Beauty and the Beast">
<text>&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a fairy tale written by the French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and published in 1740 in &quot;La Jeune Américaine et les contes marins&quot; (&quot;The Young American and Marine Tales&quot;).

Villeneuve&#x27;s lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published by French novelist Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in &quot;Magasin des enfants&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Collection&quot;) to produce the most commonly retold version. Later, Andrew Lang retold the story in &quot;Blue Fairy Book&quot;, a part of the &quot;Fairy Book&quot; series, in 1889. The fairy-tale was influenced by the story of Petrus Gonsalvus as well as Ancient Latin stories such as &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; from &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, written by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis in the second century AD, and &quot;The Pig King&quot;, an Italian fairy-tale published by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in &quot;The Facetious Nights of Straparola&quot; around 1550.

Variants of the tale are known across Europe. In France, for example, &quot;Zémire and Azor&quot; is an operatic version of the story, written by Jean-François Marmontel and composed by André Grétry in 1771, which had enormous success into the 19th century. &quot;Zémire and Azor&quot; is based on the second version of the tale. &quot;Amour pour amour&quot; (&quot;Love for Love&quot;) by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée is a 1742 play based on de Villeneuve&#x27;s version. According to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated about 4,000 years ago.

== Plot ==
=== Synopsis (Villeneuve) ===

A merchant setting out on a journey to restore his fortune offers to bring gifts for his daughters. While the elder daughters make extravagant requests, the youngest, Beauty, asks only for a rose.

On his way home the merchant takes refuge from a snowstorm in an enchanted castle. The next day he plucks a rose in the garden and his unseen host appears: a terrifying beast. The Beast spares the merchant&#x27;s life when he learns the rose is a gift. He offers to free the merchant if one of his daughters agrees to live in the castle. The merchant accepts, and upon his return Beauty insists it is her duty to take her father&#x27;s place.

The Beast is kind and generous toward Beauty, but every night when he asks her to marry him and share a bed she refuses. Meanwhile, her dreams are visited by a handsome man imprisoned in the castle and a fairy who advises her not to judge by appearances.

When the Beast gives Beauty two months to visit her family, they pressure her not to return. In a dream the Fairy warns her that the Beast is dying of a broken heart. Beauty hurries back, revives him and confesses her love.

The next evening when the Beast proposes, Beauty accepts. That night he shares her bed and immediately falls into an enchanted sleep. In the morning, he has transformed into the man from her dreams.

The Fairy arrives and reveals her role in counteracting the schemes of a wicked fairy. Not only had the Beast been a prince who was cursed until he could be loved without being charming, but Beauty had been fated to marry a monster and hidden from her original, magical, royal family from early childhood.

Beauty and the Prince are married and rule his kingdom together, reunited with their families and respected by their people.

=== Villeneuve&#x27;s original version ===

A widowed merchant lives in a mansion in a city with his twelve children: six sons and six daughters. All his daughters are very beautiful, but the youngest, Beauty, is the loveliest. Beauty is also kind and pure of heart; her elder sisters, in contrast, are cruel, selfish, and jealous of Beauty.

The merchant and his children become poor when their house burns down, and his ships are lost. The family of thirteen is forced to move to a small cottage in the countryside and work for a living. While Beauty makes a firm resolution to adjust to rural life with a cheerful disposition, her sisters do not and mistake her determination for stupidity.

Two years later, the merchant hears that one of his trade ships has returned. Before leaving to retrieve it, and possibly their fortune, he asks his children if they wish for him to bring any gifts back for them. His oldest daughters ask for clothing, jewels, and the finest dresses possible as they think that his wealth has returned. Beauty asks for nothing but her father to return home safely, but when he insists on buying her a present, she is satisfied with the promise of a rose.

When he arrives to the port to see his ship the merchant is dismayed to learn that his colleagues have already sold the cargo, thus leaving him penniless and unable to buy his daughters&#x27; presents. During his trip back home the merchant becomes lost in a vicious snowstorm. Seeking shelter, he comes upon a castle surrounded by lifelike statues. Seeing that no one is home, the merchant sneaks in and finds tables inside laden with food and drink, which seem to have been left for him by the castle&#x27;s invisible owner. The merchant accepts this gift and spends the night there.

The next morning, he is about to leave when he sees a rose garden and recalls that Beauty had desired a rose. The merchant quickly plucks the loveliest rose he can find. He is then confronted by a hideous &quot;Beast&quot; who tries to kill him for stealing his most precious possession even after accepting his hospitality. The merchant begs to be let go, revealing that he had only picked the rose as a gift for his youngest daughter. The Beast agrees to let him go, but only if he brings one of his daughters back to live with the Beast instead. He makes it clear that she must agree while under no illusions about her predicament.

The merchant is upset, but accepts this condition for the sake of his own life. The Beast sends him on his way with wealth, jewels, and fine clothes for his sons and daughters, and stresses that he must not lie to his daughters.

Upon arriving home, the merchant hands Beauty the rose she requested and informs her that it had a terrible price, before relaying what had happened during his absence. Her brothers say that they will go to the castle and fight the Beast, while his older daughters refuse to leave and place blame on Beauty, urging her to right her own wrong. The merchant dissuades them, forbidding his children from ever going near the Beast. Beauty willingly decides to go to the Beast&#x27;s castle, moving her father who remembers a Romani fortune-teller&#x27;s prophecy about his youngest daughter making his household lucky.

Once they arrive at the castle, the Beast receives Beauty with great ceremony. The merchant is sent home with a reward. The Beast gives Beauty lavish clothing, food and entertainment along with animal servants. He visits her each evening to ask her how she is doing. Although they converse at length, he seems unable to express himself well, leading her to assume he is not intelligent.

Every night he asks Beauty to marry him and she refuses. After each proposal Beauty dreams of a handsome stranger who is imprisoned in the castle, along with an apparition of a fairy who tells her not to be deceived by appearances.

For several months Beauty lives a life of luxury at the Beast&#x27;s castle. Her feelings for the man in her dreams and her gratitude toward the Beast come into conflict. When the Beast asks her what is wrong, she pleads homesickness and he sadly allows her to leave, warning her that if she does not return within two months he will die of a broken heart.

Beauty agrees to this and is presented with an enchanted ring, which allows her to wake up in her family&#x27;s new home in an instant. Her older sisters are surprised to find her well-fed and dressed in finery, and their old jealousy quickly flares when their suitors&#x27; gazes turn to Beauty, even though she bestows lavish gifts on them. Her brothers do all they can to prevent her from going back to his castle, and she reluctantly agrees to stay longer.
When the two months have passed, she envisions the Beast dying alone on the castle grounds and hastens to return despite her brothers&#x27; resolve to prevent her from doing so.

Once she is back in the castle, Beauty&#x27;s fears are confirmed as she finds the Beast near death in a cave on the grounds. Seeing this, Beauty is distraught, realizing that she loves him. She fetches water from a nearby spring, which she uses to resuscitate him.

The next night when the Beast proposes, Beauty agrees to marry him. The sky is lit up by a magical fireworks show. That night he goes to bed with her, falling into an enchanted sleep as soon as he lays down.

When Beauty wakes up next to him the next morning she finds that the Beast has transformed into the unknown man from her dreams. She learns he is a prince when the Fairy who has been appearing to her arrives with the Prince&#x27;s mother the Queen whose joy falters when she finds out that Beauty is a lowly merchant&#x27;s daughter. The Fairy chastises the Queen and reveals that Beauty is actually a princess and their niece. Her birth father was the Queen&#x27;s brother, the King of Fortunate Island, who believed Beauty died as a baby; and her birth mother was the Fairy&#x27;s sister.

When the matter of Beauty&#x27;s background is resolved, she requests that the Prince tell his tale.

The Prince informs Beauty that his father died before he was born, and his mother had to fight an enemy to defend the kingdom. The Queen left the Prince in the care of his Evil Fairy Godmother, who tried to seduce him when he became an adult and helped his mother win the war.

When the war ended, the Evil Fairy accompanied the Queen and the Prince back to the castle and asked him to marry her. But the Prince refused. The Evil Fairy, in a rage, transformed him into an ugly Beast in front of his shocked mother. Before leaving mother and son, the Evil Fairy warned them that only a maiden&#x27;s act of true love could break the spell and that if anyone else beside the Queen knew about it, the Prince would be a Beast forever.

After the Prince&#x27;s godmother left, the Good Fairy arrived to help him by turning the castle&#x27;s servants to stone to prevent them from revealing the curse to outsiders, and promising to protect his mother from the Evil Fairy. The Good Fairy also summoned her genie servants to keep the Prince company while he waited for Beauty&#x27;s arrival.
At the end of his story, the Prince revealed to Beauty that the animals in the castle were those same servants, and that the Good Fairy had caused her to see the Prince&#x27;s true self in dreams.

The Good Fairy then summons the King Of Fortunate Island to meet Beauty, and having reunited the family, brings the petrified servants back to life.

She tells them all how years ago the Evil Fairy, the Prince&#x27;s godmother, had been plotting to marry the King of Fortunate Island but Beauty&#x27;s mother had married him instead. As revenge the Evil Fairy revealed her crime of having a mortal husband and child to the Fairy Queen, thus causing her imprisonment in Fairyland shortly after Beauty&#x27;s birth. She also convinced the other fairies to curse the infant Princess to marry a Beast as a further punishment.

Meanwhile, on Fortunate Island, the people had faked their imprisoned Queen&#x27;s death after they were unable to find her. The Evil Fairy hired a greedy couple to kill the Princess. When the King of the Fortunate Island believed both his wife and daughter to be dead, he banished the Evil Fairy.

But the Good Fairy had secretly rescued her young niece. She had turned into a bear and killed the would-be murderers. The Good Fairy then brought the Princess to a cottage with three sleeping nursesmaids and a little girl the same age as her who was very ill and had been sent to the countryside by her father, the merchant, in hopes that the fresh air would cure her. Tragically, she died instead. The Good Fairy swapped the two children.

Unaware she was not their master&#x27;s child, the three nursemaids soon returned to the city with the Princess. The Good Fairy followed the nurses to the merchant&#x27;s mansion, disguised herself as a Romani fortune-teller and told the merchant the prophecy of &quot;his&quot; youngest child bringing luck to his household. She also decreed that the baby be named &quot;Beauty.&quot;

She arranged for Beauty and the Prince to meet, the young couple&#x27;s love both breaking the Evil Fairy&#x27;s spell and fulfilling the Princess&#x27;s destiny to marry a Beast. She also testified against the Evil Fairy in Fairyland, who was now imprisoned there.

After the Good Fairy finishes her story, her sister arrives at the castle, having been freed by the Fairy Queen. With the entire Royal Family reunited, Beauty&#x27;s aunt summons the merchant and his family. Beauty&#x27;s surrogate family members are told the whole truth and are made members of her court.

Beauty marries the Prince and although they want to honeymoon indefinitely, the Fairy reminds them it is their destiny and duty to govern. They live happily for hundreds of years thanks to the powers of Beauty&#x27;s fairy mother and aunt. The Prince&#x27;s mother commands that their tale be recorded in the imperial archives so everyone might know their story.

=== Beaumont&#x27;s version ===
Beaumont greatly pared down the cast of characters and pruned the tale to an almost archetypal simplicity. The story begins in much the same way as Villeneuve&#x27;s version, although now the merchant has only six children: three sons and three daughters of which Beauty is one. Unlike Villeneuve&#x27;s version, Beaumont&#x27;s version treats the merchant as Beauty&#x27;s biological father and there is no indication of her being royalty by birth. The circumstances leading to her arrival at the Beast&#x27;s castle unfold in a similar manner, but on this arrival, Beauty is informed that she is a mistress and he will obey her. Beaumont strips most of the lavish descriptions present in Beauty&#x27;s exploration of the palace and quickly jumps to her return home. She is given leave to remain there for a week, and when she arrives, her sisters feign fondness to entice her to remain another week in hopes that the Beast will devour her in anger. Again, she returns to him dying and restores his life. The two then marry and live happily ever after.

=== Lang&#x27;s version ===
A variant of Villeneuve&#x27;s version appears in Andrew Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Fairy Book&quot;. The Merchant&#x27;s mansion is burned in a fire, along with his belongings, forcing him and his family to move to their country home in the forest. His ships are lost at sea, captured by pirates, etc., except one, which returns later. Unlike the other two versions, the sisters in Lang&#x27;s story are not jealous of Beauty. Also, Lang maintained the lavish descriptions of the Beast&#x27;s palace. This version in particular is one of the most commonly told, along with those of Villeneuve and Beaumont.

This version was written between 1889 and 1913, some time after the original version, so it should be considered as a later version of the story.

== Analysis ==
The tale is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as type ATU 425C, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. It is related to the general type ATU 425, &quot;The Search for the Lost Husband&quot; and subtypes.

In a study about the myth of Cupid and Psyche, Danish folklorist Inger Margrethe Boberg argued that &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was &quot;an older form&quot; of the animal husband narrative, and that subtypes 425A, &quot;Animal as Bridegroom&quot;, and 425B, &quot;The Disenchanted Husband: The Witch&#x27;s Tasks&quot;, were secondary developments, with motifs incorporated into the narrative.

== Variants ==
The tale is one of the most popular in oral tradition.

=== Europe ===
==== France ====
Emmanuel Cosquin collected a version with a tragic ending from Lorraine titled &quot;The White Wolf&quot; (&quot;Le Loup blanc&quot;), in which the youngest daughter asks her father to bring her a singing rose when he returns. The man cannot find a singing rose for his youngest daughter, and he refuses to return home until he finds one. When he finally finds singing roses, they are in the castle of the titular white wolf, who initially wants to kill him for daring to steal his roses, but, upon hearing about his daughters, changes his mind and agrees to spare him his life under the condition he must give him the first living being that greets him when he returns home (note story of Jephthah and his daughter in Judges 11). This turns out to be his youngest daughter. In the castle, the girl discovers that the white wolf is enchanted and can turn into a human at night, but she must not tell anyone about it. Unfortunately, the girl is later visited by her two elder sisters who pressure her to tell them what is happening. When she finally does, the castle crumbles and the wolf dies.

Henri Pourrat collected a version from Auvergne in south-central France, titled &quot;Belle Rose&quot; (sometimes translated in English as &quot;Lovely Rose&quot;). In this version, the heroine and her sisters are the daughters of a poor peasant and are named after flowers, the protagonist being Rose and her sisters Marguerite (Daisy) and Julianne, respectively. The Beast is described as having a mastiff jaw, a lizard&#x27;s back legs, and a salamander&#x27;s body. The ending is closer to Villeneuve&#x27;s and Beaumont&#x27;s versions with Rose rushing back to the castle and finding the Beast lying dying beside a fountain. When the Beast asks if she knows that he can&#x27;t live without her, Rose answers yes, and the Beast turns into a human. He explains to Rose that he was a prince cursed for mocking a beggar and could only be disenchanted by a poor but kind-hearted maiden. Unlike in Beaumont&#x27;s version, it is not mentioned that the protagonist&#x27;s sisters are punished at the end.

==== Italy ====
The tale is popular in the Italian oral tradition. collected a variant from Trentino titled &quot;The Singing, Dancing and Music-making Leaf&quot; (German: &quot;Vom singenden, tanzenden und musicirenden Blatte&quot;; Italian: &quot;La foglia, che canta, che balla e che suona&quot;) in which the Beast takes the form of a snake. Instead of going to visit her family alone, the heroine can only go to her sister&#x27;s wedding if she agrees to let the snake go with her. During the wedding, they dance together, and when the girl kicks the snake&#x27;s tail, he turns into a beautiful youth, who is the son of a count.

Sicilian folklorist Giuseppe Pitrè collected a variant from Palermo titled &quot;Rusina &#x27;Mperatrici&quot; (&quot;The Empress Rosina&quot;). Domenico Comparetti included a variant from Montale titled &quot;Bellindia&quot;, in which Bellindia is the heroine&#x27;s name, while her two eldest sisters are called Carolina and Assunta. included a version titled &quot;Zelinda and the Monster&quot; (&quot;Zelinda e il Mostro&quot;), in which the heroine, called Zelinda, asks for a rose in January. Instead of going to visit her family, staying longer than she promised, and then returning to the Monster&#x27;s castle to find him dying on the ground, here the Monster shows Zelinda her father dying on a magic mirror and says the only way she can save him is saying that she loves him. Zelinda does as asked, and the Monster turns into a human, who tells her he is the son of the King of the Oranges. Both Comparetti&#x27;s and Imbriani&#x27;s versions were included in &quot;Sessanta novelle popolari montalesi&quot; by Gherardo Nerucci.

British folklorist Rachel Harriette Busk collected a version from Rome titled &quot;The Enchanted Rose-Tree&quot; where the heroine does not have any sisters. Antonio De Nino collected a variant from Abruzzo, in eastern Italy, that he also titled &quot;Bellindia&quot;, in which instead of a rose, the heroine asks for a golden carnation. Instead of a seeing it on a magic mirror, or knowing about it because the Beast tells her, here Bellinda knows what happens in her father&#x27;s house because in the garden there is a tree called the Tree of Weeping and Laughter, whose leaves turn upwards when there is joy in her family, and they drop when there is sorrow.

Francesco Mango collected a Sardinian version titled &quot;The Bear and the Three Sisters&quot; (&quot;S&#x27;urzu i is tres sorris&quot;), in which the Beast has the form of a bear.

Italo Calvino included a version on Italian Folktales titled &quot;Bellinda and the Monster&quot;, inspired mostly from Comparetti&#x27;s version, but adding some elements from De Nino&#x27;s, like the Tree of Weeping and Laughter.

==== Iberian Peninsula ====
===== Spain =====
Manuel Milá y Fontanals collected a version titled &quot;The King&#x27;s Son, Disenchanted&quot; (&quot;El hijo del rey, desencantado&quot;). In this tale, when the father asks his three daughters what they want, the youngest asks for the hand of the king&#x27;s son, and everybody thinks she is haughty for wanting such a thing. The father orders his servants to kill her, but they spare her and she hides in the woods. There, she meets a wolf that brings her to a castle and takes her in. The girl learns that in order to break his spell, she must kill the wolf and throw his body into the fire after opening it. From the body flies a pigeon, and from the pigeon an egg. When the girl breaks the egg, the king&#x27;s son comes out. Francisco Maspons y Labrós extended and translated the tale to Catalan, and included it in the second volume of &quot;Lo Rondallayre&quot;.

Maspons y Labrós collected a variant from Catalonia titled &quot;Lo trist&quot;. In this version, instead of roses, the youngest daughter asks for a coral necklace. Whenever one of her family members is sick, the heroine is warned by the garden (a spring with muddy waters; a tree with withered leaves). When she visits her family, she is warned that she must return to the castle if she hears a bell ringing. After her third visit to her family, the heroine returns to the garden where she finds her favorite rosebush withered. When she plucks a rose, the beast appears and turns into a beautiful youth.

A version from Extremadura, titled &quot;The Bear Prince&quot; (&quot;El príncipe oso&quot;), was collected by Sergio Hernández de Soto and shows a similar introduction as in Beaumont&#x27;s and Villeneuve&#x27;s versions: the heroine&#x27;s father loses his fortune after a shipwreck. When the merchant has the chance to recover his wealth, he asks his daughters what gift they want from his travels. The heroine asks for a lily. When the merchant finds a lily, a bear appears, saying that his youngest daughter must come to the garden because only she can repair the damage the merchant has caused. His youngest daughter seeks the bear and finds him lying on the ground, wounded. The only way to heal him is by restoring the lily the father took, and when the girl restores it, the bear turns into a prince. This tale was translated to English by Elsie Spicer Eells and retitled &quot;The Lily and the Bear&quot;.

Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Sr. collected a version from Almenar de Soria titled &quot;The Beast of the Rose Bush&quot; (&quot;La fiera del rosal&quot;), in which the heroine is the daughter of a king instead of a merchant.

Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Jr. published a version from Sepúlveda, Segovia titled &quot;The Beast of the Garden&quot; (&quot;La fiera del jardín&quot;). In this version, the heroine has a stepmother and two stepsisters and asks for an unspecified white flower.

&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in the Basque language is called &quot;Ederra eta Piztia&quot;.

===== Portugal =====
In a Portuguese version collected by Zófimo Consiglieri Pedroso, the heroine asks for &quot;a slice of roach off a green meadow&quot;. The father finally finds a slice of roach off a green meadow in a castle that appears to be uninhabited, but he hears a voice saying he must bring his youngest daughter to the palace. While the heroine is at the palace, the same unseen voice informs her of the goings-on at her father&#x27;s house using birds as messengers. When the heroine visits her family, the master of the castle sends a horse to let her know it is time to return. The heroine must go after hearing him three times. The third time she goes to visit her family, her father dies. After the funeral, she&#x27;s tired and oversleeps, missing the horse&#x27;s neigh repeat three times before it leaves. When she finally returns to the castle, she finds the beast dying. With his last breath, he curses her and her entire family. The heroine dies a few days after, and her sisters spend the rest of their lives in poverty.

Another Portuguese version from Ourilhe, collected by: Francisco Adolfo Coelho and titled &quot;A Bella-menina&quot;, is closer to Beaumont&#x27;s tale in its happy ending – the beast is revived and disenchanted.

==== Belgium and the Netherlands ====
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in the Standard Dutch language is &quot;De Schone en het Beest&quot; (literally &quot;The Beauty and the Beast&quot;), but it is usually called &quot;Belle en het Beest&quot; (literally &quot;Belle and the Beast&quot;).

In a Flemish version from Veurne titled &quot;Roosken zonder Doornen&quot; or &quot;Rose without Thorns&quot;, the prince is disenchanted differently than in Beaumont&#x27;s and Villeneuve&#x27;s versions. The heroine and the monster attend each of the weddings of the heroine&#x27;s elder sisters, and to break the spell, the heroine has to give a toast for the beast. In the first wedding, the heroine forgets, but in the second she remembers, and the beast becomes human.

In a second Flemish variant collected by Amaat Joos, titled &quot;Van het Schoon Kind&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s father is a king instead of a merchant, and when he asks his three daughters what they want him to bring them when he returns from a long journey, the king&#x27;s youngest daughter asks for a bush of trembling roses while her two eldest sisters asks for robes with golden flowers and a silver skirt. During her stay at the monster&#x27;s castle the princess has a nightmare where she sees the monster drowning in a pond, and after she wakes up and finds out the monster is not in the corner where he sleeps, she goes to the garden where she finds the monster in the same situation she saw him in her dream. The monster turns into a prince after the princess saves him.

Another Flemish version from Wuustwezel, collected by Victor de Meyere, is closer to Beaumont&#x27;s plot, the merchant&#x27;s youngest daughter staying one day more at her family&#x27;s home and soon returning to the Beast&#x27;s palace. When she returns, she fears something bad has happened to him. This one is one of the few versions in which the merchant accompanies his daughter back to the Beast&#x27;s castle.

More similar Beaumont&#x27;s plot is a Dutch version from Driebergen titled &quot;Rozina&quot;. In this version, it is Rozina&#x27;s vow to marry the Beast that eventually breaks the spell.

==== Central Europe ====
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (Albanian: &quot;E Bukura dhe Bisha&quot;, Bulgarian: Краса́вицата и Звя́ра, &quot;Krasávitsata i Zvyára&quot;, Macedonian: Убавицата и Ѕверот, &quot;Ubavitsata i Dzverot&quot;, Serbo-Croatian: Лепо̀тица и Зве̑р, &quot;Lepòtica&quot; [&quot;Lepòtitsa&quot;] &quot;i Zvȇr&quot;, Slovenian: Лепоти́ца ин Зве̑р, &quot;Lepotíca&quot; [&quot;Lepotítsa&quot;] &quot;in Zvẹ̑r&quot;, Czechian: &quot;Kráska a Zvíře&quot;, Slovakian: &quot;Kráska a Zviera&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;A Szépség és a Szörnyeteg&quot;, Polish: &quot;Piękna i Bestia&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Frumoasa și Bestia&quot;, German: &quot;Die Schöne und das Biest&quot;) is known in several different variants in Central Europe.

The Brothers Grimm originally collected a variant of the story, titled &quot;The Summer and Winter Garden&quot; (&quot;Von dem Sommer- und Wintergarten&quot;). Here, the youngest daughter asks for a rose in the winter, so the father only finds one in a garden that is half-eternal winter and half-eternal summer. After making a deal with the beast, the father does not tell his daughters anything. Eight days later, the beast appears in the merchant&#x27;s house and takes his youngest daughter away. When the heroine returns home, her father is ill. She cannot save him, and he dies. The heroine stays longer for her father&#x27;s funeral, and when she finally returns, she finds the beast lying beneath a heap of cabbages. After the daughter revives the beast by pouring water over him, he turns into a handsome prince. The tale appeared in Brothers Grimm&#x27;s collection&#x27;s first edition, in 1812, but because the tale was too similar to its French counterpart, they omitted it in the next editions.

Despite the other folklorists collecting variants from German-speaking territories, Ludwig Bechstein published two versions of the story. In the first, &quot;Little Broomstick&quot; (&quot;Besenstielchen&quot;), the heroine, Nettchen, has a best friend called Little Broomstick because her father is a broommaker. Like in &quot;The Summer and Winter Garden&quot;, Nettchen asks for roses in the dead of winter, which her father only finds in the Beast&#x27;s garden. When a carriage comes to bring Nettchen to the Beast&#x27;s castle, Nettchen&#x27;s father sends Little Broomstick, who pretends to be Nettchen. The Beast discovers the scheme, sends Little Broomstick back home, and Nettchen is sent to the Beast&#x27;s castle. The prince is disenchanted before Nettchen&#x27;s visit to her family to cure her father using the sap of a plant from the prince&#x27;s garden. Jealous of her fortune, Nettchen&#x27;s sisters drown her in the bath, but Nettchen is revived by the same sorceress who cursed the prince. Nettchen&#x27;s eldest sisters are too dangerous, but Nettchen doesn&#x27;t want them dead, so the sorceress turns them into stone statues.

In Bechstein&#x27;s second version, &quot;The Little Nut Twig&quot; (&quot;Das Nußzweiglein&quot;), the heroine asks for the titular twig. When the father finally finds it, he has to make a deal with a bear, promising him the first creature that he meets when he arrives at home. This turns out to be his youngest daughter. Like in &quot;Little Broomstick&quot;, the merchant tries to deceive the bear by sending another girl, but the bear discovers his scheme and the merchant&#x27;s daughter is sent to the bear. After she and the bear cross twelve rooms of disgusting creatures, the bear turns into a prince.

Carl and Theodor Colshorn collected two versions from Hannover. In the first one, &quot;The Clinking Clanking Lowesleaf&quot; (&quot;Vom klinkesklanken Löwesblatt&quot;), the heroine is the daughter of a king. She asks for the titular leaf, which the king only gets after making a deal with a black poodle, promising to give him the first person that greets the king when he arrives home. This turns out to be his youngest daughter. The merchant tries to trick the poodle, giving him other girls pretending to be the princess, but the poodle sees through this. Finally, the princess is sent to the poodle, who brings her to a cabin in the middle of the woods, where the princess feels so alone. She wishes for company, even if it is an old beggar woman. In an instant, an old beggar woman appears, and she tells the princess how to break the spell in exchange for inviting her to the princess&#x27; wedding. The princess keeps her promise, and her mother and sisters, who expressed disgust at the sight of the old beggar woman, become crooked and lame.

In Carl and Theodor Colshorn&#x27;s second version, &quot;The Cursed Frog&quot; (&quot;Der verwunschene Frosch&quot;), the heroine is a merchant&#x27;s daughter. The enchanted prince is a frog, and the daughter asks for a three-colored rose.

Ernst Meier collected a version from Swabia, in southwestern Germany, in which the heroine has only one sister instead of two.

Ignaz and Josef Zingerle collected an Austrian variant from Tannheim titled &quot;The Bear&quot; (&quot;Der Bär&quot;) in which the heroine is the eldest of the merchant&#x27;s three daughters. Like in &quot;The Summer and Winter Garden&quot; and &quot;Little Broomstick&quot;, the protagonist asks for a rose in the middle of winter. Like in Zingerle&#x27;s version, the Beast is a bear.

In the Swiss variant, &quot;The Bear Prince&quot; (&quot;Der Bärenprinz&quot;), collected by Otto Sutermeister, the youngest daughter asks for grapes.

In another Polish version from Kraków, the heroine is called Basia and has a stepmother and two stepsisters. An apple also plays a relevant role when the heroine goes to visit her family in a Polish version from Mazovia, in this case to warn the heroine that she is staying longer than she promised.

In a Czechian variant, the heroine&#x27;s mother plucks the flower and makes the deal with the Beast, who is a basilisk, who the heroine later will behead to break the spell.

In a Moravian version, the youngest daughter asks for three white roses, and the Beast is a dog; In another Moravian version, the heroine asks for a single red rose and the Beast is a bear.

In a Slovenian version from Livek titled &quot;The Enchanted Bear and the Castle&quot; (&quot;Začaran grad in medved&quot;), the heroine breaks the spell reading about the fate of the enchanted castle in an old dusty book.

In a Hungarian version titled &quot;The Speaking Grapes, the Smiling Apple and the Tinkling Apricot&quot; (&quot;Szóló szőlő, mosolygó alma, csengő barack&quot;), the princess asks her father for the titular fruits, and the Beast is a pig. The king agrees to give him his youngest daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage if the pig is capable of moving the king&#x27;s carriage, which is stuck in the mud.

==== Scandinavia ====
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (Danish: &quot;Skønheden og udyret&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Skjønnheten og udyret&quot; or &quot;Skjønnheita og udyret&quot; , Swedish: &quot;Skönheten och odjuret&quot;, Icelandic: &quot;Fríða og Dýrið&quot;, or &quot;Yndisfríð og Ófreskjan&quot;, Faroese: &quot;Vakurleikin og Ódjórið&quot;, Finnish: &quot;Kaunotar ja Hirviö&quot;) is well-known in the Nordic countries, especially since the adaptation by Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1991.

Evald Tang Kristensen collected a Danish version that follows Beaumont&#x27;s version almost exactly. The most significant difference is that the enchanted prince is a horse.

In a version from the Faroe Islands, the youngest daughter asks for an apple instead of a rose.

&quot;Kvitebjørn kong Valemon&quot; and &quot;Østenfor sol og vestenfor måne&quot; are some Norwegian variants of the fairy-tale.

Alexander Afanasyev collected a Russian version, &quot;The Enchanted Tsarevich&quot; (Закля́тый царе́вич, &quot;Zaklyátyĭ tsarévitch&quot;), in which the youngest daughter draws the flower she wants her father to bring her. The beast is a three-headed winged snake. There is a more famous version, &quot;The Scarlet Flower&quot;, written by Sergey Aksakov and published in 1858.

In a Ukrainian version, both the heroine&#x27;s parents are dead. The Beast, who has the form of a snake, gives her the ability to revive people.

==== Greece and Cyprus ====
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in Modern Greek is called &quot;Η Πεντάμορφη και το Τέρας&quot; (&quot;I Pentámorfi kai to Téras&quot;) or &quot;Η Ωραία και το Τέρας&quot; (&quot;I Oraía kai to Téras&quot;), and Belle&#x27;s name in Modern Greek is Μπελ (&quot;Bel&quot;, lit. translit. &quot;Mpel&quot;, pronounced as &quot;Bell&quot;).

In a version from the island of Zákynthos in Western Greece, the prince is turned into a snake by a nereid whom he rejected.

=== Asia ===
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (Hebrew: הַיָפָה וְהַחַיָּה, &quot;Ha-Yafáh ve-Ha-Chayyáh&quot;, Arabic: الجميلة والوحش, &quot;Al-Jamīla wa-Al-Waḥsh&quot;, Persian: دیو و دلبر, &quot;Delbar o Div&quot;, Kurdish: &quot;Bedew û Cinawir&quot; or &quot;Ciwanê û Cinawir&quot;, Turkish: &quot;Güzel ve Çirkin&quot;, Chinese: 美 野 or 美 野 , &quot;Měinǚ yǔ Yěshòu&quot;, Japanese: 美 野 , &quot;Bíjò to̞ Yàjū&quot;, or び や , &quot;Bídyò to̞ Yàdyū&quot;, Korean: 미 야, &quot;Minyeo wa Yasu&quot;, Indonesian: &quot;Si Cantik dan Si Buruk Rupa&quot;, Tagalog: &quot;Si Maganda at ang Halimaw&quot;) is known in some different variants in Asia.

==== Eastern Asia ====
North American missionary Adele M. Fielde collected a tale from Swatow, China, titled &quot;The Fairy Serpent&quot;. In this tale, the heroine&#x27;s family is visited by wasps until she follows the beast, who is a serpent. One day, the well she usually fetches water from is dry, so she walks to a spring. When the heroine returns, she finds the snake dying and revives him plunging him in the water. This turns him into a human.

In a second Chinese variant, &quot;Pearl of the Sea&quot;, the youngest daughter of rich merchant Pekoe asks for a chip of The Great Wall of China because of a dream that she had. Her father steals a chip and is threatened by an army of Tatars who work for their master. In reality, the Tatar master is her uncle Chang, who has been enchanted prior to the story, and could only be released from his curse until a woman consented to live with him in the Great Wall.

==== Southeast Asia ====
=== North America ===
==== United States ====
William Wells Newell published an Irish American variant simply titled &quot;Rose&quot; in the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;. In this version, the Beast takes the form of a lion.

Marie Campbell collected a version from the Appalachian Mountains, titled &quot;A Bunch of Laurela Blooms for a Present&quot;, in which the prince was turned into a frog.

Joseph Médard Carrière collected a version in which the Beast is described having a lion&#x27;s head, a horse&#x27;s back legs, a bull&#x27;s body, and a snake&#x27;s tail. Like the end of Beaumont&#x27;s version, Beauty&#x27;s sisters are turned into stone statues.

In a variant from Schoharie, New York, collected by Emelyn Elizabeth Gardner with the title &quot;The Rosy Story&quot;, the heroine is named Ellen. The character that demands the youngest daughter is a headless man, but the Beast-like figure is a large toad.

Folklorist Fanny Dickerson Bergen published a fragmentary variant from Ohio, with the title &quot;The Golden Bird&quot;, which is the object the youngest daughter asks for.

==== Mexico ====
Mexican linguist Pablo González Casanova collected a version from the Nahuatl titled &quot;Cizuanton huan yolcatl&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La doncella y la fiera&quot;), in which after returning to her family&#x27;s home, the heroine finds the beast dead on the ground. The girl falls asleep by his side, and she dreams of the beast, who tells her to cut a specific flower and spray its water on his face. The heroine does so, and the beast turns into a beautiful young man.

=== South America ===
Lindolfo Gomes collected a Brazilian version titled &quot;A Bela e a Fera&quot; in which the deal consists of the father promising to give the Beast the first living creature that greets him at home. The heroine later visits her family because her eldest sister is getting married.

== Broader themes ==
Harries identifies the two most popular strands of fairy-tale in the 18th century as the fantastical romance for adults and the didactic tale for children. Beauty and the Beast is interesting as it bridges this gap, with Villeneuve&#x27;s version being written as a salon tale for adults and Beaumont&#x27;s being written as a didactic tale for children.

== Commentary ==

Tatar (2017) compares the tale to the theme of &quot;animal brides and grooms&quot; found in folklore throughout the world,
pointing out that the French tale was specifically intended for the preparation of young girls in 18th century France for arranged marriages. 
The urban opening is unusual in fairy-tales, as is the social class of the characters, neither royal nor peasants; it may reflect the social changes occurring at the time of its first writing.

Hamburger (2015) points out that the design of the Beast in the 1946 film adaptation by Jean Cocteau was inspired by the portrait of Petrus Gonsalvus, a native of Tenerife who suffered from hypertrichosis, causing an abnormal growth of hair on his face and other parts, and who came under the protection of the French king and married a beautiful Parisian woman named Catherine.

<text>In Finnish mythology and lore, a menninkäinen () is believed to be a leprechaun-like inhabitant of the forests. Fairy tale depictions often involve riddling, dominance struggles and favors elicited. Menninkäinen were probably originally thought to be spirits of dead people, but folklore about them has changed during time, and they turned to be something else.

In modern usage, the word is usually used to mean goblins, hobgoblins and gnomes. Not all Finnish words for the little folk have an English equivalent, and vice versa, so confusion in the translation of these terms is quite common.</text><links>

<text>The Puttermans are a fictional family that appeared in a series of advertisements for Duracell from 1994 to 1996.

== Background ==
The Puttermans were a family of plastic robots who outlasted others, thanks to their Duracell brand batteries (a playful reference to their deadpan 1970s ad campaign which featured head-to-head competition between toys). The campaign was made to combat the successful Energizer Bunny ad campaign. The fictional Brand X &quot;other battery&quot; depicted in the ad was made to look like rival Energizer batteries, much in the same way that Energizer&#x27;s fictional rival &quot;Supervolt&quot; was made to resemble Duracell batteries. They also bore a slight resemblance to defunct Burgess batteries, which was likely coincidence.

The ad campaign was created by New York-based advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. The original campaign was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, whereas later executions (using the &quot;No battery is stronger, longer&quot; claim) were helmed by David Kellogg.

The characters were developed by special effects guru Steve Johnson and his company XFX, Inc. The actors were made up to look as if they were claymation or computer animation characters. The costumes consisted of boxy modular units of stiff foam rubber coated with urethane. The characters all had large copper-top batteries protruding from their backs and their faces were made of state-of-the-art latex prosthetics designed to heavily caricature the actors&#x27; own features, and complete character wardrobes. They tended to unsettle viewers, due to their non-human yet non-toy nor cartoon appearance, and the series of commercials was abandoned. At the time, the actor identities were not revealed to preserve the family&#x27;s mystique.

== Characters ==
The family consisted of:
* Herb, the father (Keith Langsdale)
* Flo, his wife, the mother (Marla Frees)
* Son, Zack (Debi Derryberry)
* Daughter, Trish (Krystee Clark)
* Grandma Putterman, who was actually played by a male actor (K.W. Miller)
* Aunt Gert (Lanie Zera)

Other Characters
*Larry Doty
*Todd
*Trish&#x27;s two boyfriends.

== Plots ==
Some of the commercial plots included the following:
* The Puttermans attend a family reunion barbecue. A talkative relative shuts off mid-sentence and falls face first into a full plate, after Herb swapped her battery out for &quot;one of those &quot;other&quot; batteries.&quot;
* Trish Putterman and boyfriend Bruce sit on a porch swing, and wish that their romantic night could go on forever with the help of Duracell.
* Grandma Putterman is so filled with energy, she can&#x27;t stop dancing, even though she has been on the same battery &quot;since the last ice age.&quot;
* The Putterman family go on a camping trip and find that their flashlights still work with the help of Duracell.
* Herb answers the front door and it&#x27;s Trish&#x27;s date who thinks batteries are batteries.
* Trish and Zack are in a drive thru and Todd, who has a crush on Trish, is working with an off brand battery.
* The family visits a museum of art and the museum director is using an off-brand battery, leading to a domino disaster.
* The family parrot is running low on batteries, Herb gives him a long lasting Duracell battery and he talks so much they take his cage outside.
* The family spends some time at the miniature golf course with a friend who&#x27;s using an off brand battery.
* The family goes on a fishing trip while on vacation.

Halloween costumes of Herb and Flo, complete with latex masks, were released in North America.

On the December 3, 1994 episode of the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as part of Weekend Update, anchor Norm Macdonald joked, &quot;The new ad campaign for Duracell batteries is already having a dramatic effect. Over seventy percent of consumers say they now find the batteries, quote, &#x27;creepy and disturbing&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="243680" wikidata="Q187413" url="?curid=243680" title="Álvaro Uribe">
<text>Álvaro Uribe Vélez (born 4 July 1952) is a Colombian who served as the 31st President of Colombia from 7 August 2002 to 7 August 2010.

Uribe started his political career in his home department of Antioquia. He held offices in the Public Enterprises of Medellín and in the Ministry of Labor and was the director of the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (1980–1982). He became the Mayor of Medellín in October 1982. He was a senator between 1986 and 1994 and finally the Governor of Antioquia between 1995 and 1997 before being elected President of Colombia in 2002.

Following his 2002 election, Uribe led an all-out military offensive against leftist guerrilla groups such as the FARC and the ELN with funding and backing from the Clinton and Bush administrations in the form of a $2.8 billion USD direct foreign aid package called &quot;Plan Colombia&quot;. He also led a controversial effort to demobilize the right-wing paramilitary group known as the AUC. All of
these groups were part of the Colombian Armed Conflict. His role in the conflict was accompanied by large-scale alleged exactions: thousands of civilians were killed by the Colombian army, as part of the &quot;false positives&quot; scandal, with almost total impunity. Their deaths are being investigated by the United Nations. Millions of people were the victims of forced displacement.

In August 2010, Uribe was appointed vice-chairman of the UN panel investigating the Gaza flotilla raid. In 2012 Uribe and a group of political allies founded the right-wing Democratic Center movement to contest the 2014 national elections. He was elected senator in the 2014 parliamentary election and took office in July 2014. Uribe was critical of his successor Juan Manuel Santos&#x27;s peace talks with the FARC guerrillas.

In August 2020, the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia ordered his arrest as part of an investigation into bribery and witness tampering. He was released from house arrest on 10 October. The case went to the Fiscalía General de la Nación, after which Uribe resigned from his Senate seat. A number of his political opponents have claimed for years that Uribe should be prosecuted, alleging he has ties with paramilitarism.

==Early life and education==
Álvaro Uribe was born in Medellín, the oldest of five children. His father, Alberto Uribe, was a landowner. When he was 10, his family left their Salgar ranch and moved to Medellín. He graduated in 1970 from the Instituto Jorge Robledo, after being expelled from the Medellín Benedictine School for arguing with the Benedictine monks.

Uribe studied law at the University of Antioquia and graduated in 1977. His father, who was close to the Medellín Cartel and a paramilitary militia, was killed by a guerrilla group during a 1983 kidnapping attempt. After his father&#x27;s death, Uribe focused on his political career and became a member of the Colombian Liberal Party. Uribe was appointed mayor of Medellín by Antioquia governor Álvaro Villegas in 1982, although he only held the post for five months as he resigned for reasons that remain controversial. According to Villegas, then President Belisario Betancur pressured the governor to ask for his resignation because he claimed that Uribe had links to the Medellín Cartel.
In 1993, he attended Harvard University, receiving a Certificate of Special Studies in Administration and Management from Harvard Extension School and a Certificate in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution from Harvard Law School. Between 1998 and 1999, after having completed his term in office as the governor of Antioquia, he studied at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, England, on a Chevening-Simón Bolívar scholarship and was appointed Senior Associate Member at St Antony&#x27;s College.

Uribe married Lina María Moreno Mejía in 1979. They have two sons, Tomás and Jerónimo.

==Political career==
In 1976, at the age of 24, Uribe was Chief of Assets for the Public Utilities of Medellín (&quot;Empresas Públicas de Medellín&quot;). He served as Secretary General of the Ministry of Labor under Alfonso López Michelsen from 1977 to 1978. During this time, he married Lina Moreno, a philosopher from Medellín. President Julio César Turbay named him Director of Civil Aviation from 1980 to 1982, at the age of 28, after the previous director was assassinated. He was appointed Mayor of Medellín in 1982, but was removed five months later due to alleged connections with drug cartels.

===Senator of Colombia===
Uribe was elected one of Antioquia&#x27;s senators from 1986 to 1990, and again from 1990 to 1994. As senator, he served as president of the Seventh Commission and he supported laws dealing with reform of pensions, labor and social security, as well as promotion of administrative careers, cooperative banking, brown sugar, and protection for women. Some of the legislation later drew criticism, in particular some which reduced the state&#x27;s responsibility for social security. During his later term, he received official and unofficial awards as one of the &quot;best senators&quot; (1990, 1992 and 1993) and as the senator with the &quot;best legislative initiatives&quot; (1992).

===Governor of Antioquia===
He was elected governor of the department of Antioquia for the 1995 to 1997 term. During his term, Uribe developed what he described as a model for a communitarian state, where in theory, citizens would participate in the administration&#x27;s decision making. It was claimed that this model would help improve employment, education, administrative transparency and public security.

Within his jurisdiction, Uribe openly supported a national program of licensed private security services that became known as CONVIVIR, which had been created by Decree 356 issued by the Colombian Defense Ministry in February 1994. The groups quickly became controversial – while some reportedly improved security in communities and intelligence coordination with the military, their members were accused of abusing civilians and operated without serious oversight. In 1998, Human Rights Watch stated: &quot;we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the Magdalena Medio and of the southern Cesar regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians who were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or who refused to join the cooperative groups&quot;.

===2002 presidential election===


Uribe ran as an independent liberal candidate, having unofficially separated from his former party. His electoral platform centered on confronting Colombia&#x27;s main guerrilla movement, the FARC. Other relevant propositions included slashing the national administration&#x27;s expenses, fighting corruption and initiating a national referendum to resolve several of the country&#x27;s political and economic concerns.

Colombia&#x27;s government under President Andres Pastrana had engaged in peace negotiations with the largest guerrilla group, the FARC, but after four years of peace negotiations without cease-fires, disapproval of Colombia&#x27;s main parties grew. Violence was rampant. The FARC claimed they had taken control of some 100 municipalities of Colombia out of 1093 at that moment. Kidnappings were common and were among the highest in the world, as well as the assassination and crime rate. The AUC was also gaining influence, and expanding its massacres and illicit drugs production, competing with FARC, ELN and other narco-traffickers.

Until at least 2001, polls showed that at most 2% of the electorate contemplated voting for Uribe and that the Liberal Party&#x27;s Horacio Serpa would probably win. But public mood shifted in his favor after the peace process with the guerrillas degenerated. The administration of President Andrés Pastrana had failed for four years to secure a cease-fire, and Uribe began to be seen as a candidate who might provide a viable security program. Former General Harold Bedoya, a candidate with a superficially similar program, remained marginalized.

Uribe was elected President of Colombia in the first round of 26 May 2002 elections with 53% of the popular vote. His running mate was Francisco Santos Calderón, a member of the Santos family, who have a long-lasting tradition as members of the Colombian Liberal Party and as owners of Colombian daily newspaper &quot;El Tiempo&quot;. Santos was also one of the founders of the anti-kidnapping NGO &quot;Fundación País Libre&quot;, created shortly after his own experience as a hostage of drug lord Pablo Escobar.

Observers considered the elections mostly free of foul play at the national level, but there were instances of active intimidation of voters and candidates, by the actions of guerrilla and paramilitary groups. 47% of the potential electorate voted, down from the previous round of voting. 

Some of Uribe&#x27;s opponents made accusations during his campaign, especially in a speech by Horacio Serpa and a book published by Newsweek&#x27;s Joseph Contreras, who interviewed Uribe that year. Claims centered on Uribe&#x27;s alleged past personal relationships with members of the Medellín Cartel and the sympathy that some paramilitary spokesmen expressed towards Uribe as a candidate. Uribe and his supporters denied or undermined these claims, and critics never committed to legal action because there was no evidence for these claims.

Former paramilitary Salvatore Mancuso, commander of the AUC, admitted in 2023 that his organisation had supported Álvaro Uribe&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2002.

==Presidency (2002–2010)==
===Internal conflict===
During his tenure, Uribe&#x27;s declared priority was to contain or defeat the three main armed groups in Colombia, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), National Liberation Army (ELN), and FARC. And by the end of his first term in office the AUC had other right-wing militias agree to disarm and go to jail under special sentences of seven years.

Uribe stated that the government had to first show military superiority in order to eventually make the guerrillas return to the negotiating table with a more flexible position, even if this would only happen after his term in office expired. Early in his government, he was quoted as saying that Colombia&#x27;s main concerns were the challenges of terrorism and the narcotics trade. In a dialog with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Talking Point&quot;, Uribe stated: &quot;Of course we need to eliminate social injustice in Colombia but what is first? Peace. Without peace, there is no investment. Without investment, there are no fiscal resources for the government to invest in the welfare of the people&quot;.

His security program was based on a policy of democratic security, aiming to:
# Gradually restore police presence in all municipalities.
# Increase judicial action against crimes of high social impact.
# Strengthen public institutions.
# Reduce human rights violations.
# Dismantle terrorist organizations (especially armed rebel groups; the main one is the FARC-EP).
# Reduce kidnappings and extortion.
# Reduce homicide levels.
# Prevent forced displacement and facilitating the return of forcefully-displaced people.
# Continue to fight the illegal drug trade through interdiction, eradication and judicial action.

The policy intended to achieve these goals by:
# Engaging the civilian population more actively.
# Supporting soldiers.
# Increasing intelligence capacity.
# Reinstating control over national roads.
# Demobilizing illegal groups.
# Integrating the armed forces services.
# Increasing defense spending.
In early 2002, Uribe&#x27;s administration decreed a one-time tax of 1.2% of the liquid assets of the higher-income Colombians and corporations, with the goal of raising US$800 million. More than $650 million was collected before the final payment quota was made, surpassing original expectations. Another goal was to increase defense expenditures from a current level of about 3.6% of GDP to 6% of GDP by 2006.

According to official government statistical information from August 2004, in two years, homicides, kidnappings, and terrorist attacks in Colombia decreased by as much as 50% – their lowest levels in almost 20 years. In 2003, there were 7,000 fewer homicides than in 2002 – a decrease of 27%. By April 2004, the government had established permanent police or military presence in every Colombian municipality for the first time in decades.

The Colombian Embassy in Washington states that, as a result of this policy, the Colombian armed forces would now have: &quot;60% more combat-ready soldiers than four years ago; Helicopters which have significantly improved the mobility of the Armed Forces throughout the national territory; Attack helicopters ensuring the means to be more aggressive in the fight against FARC and AUC; Increased basic combat supplies, including rifles and ammunition; and [has received] significant less human rights complaints against them&quot;.

In January 2005, Human Rights Watch stated: &quot;Paramilitary groups maintain close ties with a number of Colombian military units. The Uribe administration has yet to take effective action to break these ties by investigating and prosecuting high-ranking members of the armed forces credibly alleged to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. Credible reports indicate that some of the territories from which the military has ejected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia, FARC) are now under the control of paramilitary groups, which continue to carry out indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population&quot;.

A February 2005 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the year 2004 stated: &quot;Achievements and advances were observed in the field of human rights and international humanitarian law; however, there were also difficulties and contradictions. ... Progress was recorded in terms of prevention and protection, including strengthening of the mechanism of community defenders and the early warning system, as well as regarding the Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s programs for the protection of vulnerable groups. Weaknesses persisted in the Government&#x27;s responses to warnings, as well as in decreasing risk factors for vulnerable groups. The Government adopted positive measures regarding the destruction of stored anti-personnel mines. The armed forces occasionally carried out operations in which they failed to observe humanitarian principles&quot;.

An anti-terror statute criticized by many human rights groups was approved by Congress on 11 December 2003 but was struck down in August 2004 by the Colombian Constitutional Court during its review. The statute granted the military judicial police rights and allowed limited arrests and communication intercepts without warrants. It was struck down due to an error in the approval procedure, an objection the court has also presented towards other bills.

After some of the AUC&#x27;s main leaders had declared a cease-fire and agreed to concentrate in Santa Fe de Ralito, several paramilitary demobilizations began in earnest, thousands of their &quot;rank and file&quot; fighters were disarmed and incorporated into government rehabilitation programs late in 2004. The main AUC leaders, who would be held responsible for atrocities, remained in the concentration zone and continued talks with the government&#x27;s High Commissioner for Peace, Luis Carlos Restrepo. A number of the paramilitary members who initially demobilized in Medellín apparently did not actually belong to the AUC and this caused public concern. The AUC commanders claimed, as the year ended, that they had difficulties controlling all of their personnel from their isolated position, that they had already demobilized some 20% of their forces, and that they would await for the drafting of the necessary legal framework before making any more significant moves.

In 2005, Uribe and Colombia&#x27;s congressmen prepared for the elections held in May and March 2006 respectively. FARC, which had been perceived as relatively passive, began to show signs of what analysts considered renewed vigor in February. It made a series of attacks against small military units, which left at least three dozen casualties. Uribe said in a speech that FARC remained strong and had never retreated, and he credited Colombia&#x27;s soldiers for previous successes against FARC activities.

Negotiations with the AUC also increased public anxiety. Discussions continued about the legal provisions to assure &quot;justice, reparation and truth&quot; after a full demobilization. Also according to many observers, paramilitary activity continued despite AUC&#x27;s declared cease-fire, albeit at a reduced rate. The demobilizations were renewed in November and finished in the complete disbandment of the group by middle February 2007, although some of the paramilitary units rejected disbandment and returned to criminal activity. These groups became known as the Black Eagles. This group is relatively small in comparison to the AUC and have not been able to achieve the notoriety or the military power of their predecessor, but are present on some former paramilitary areas, like Catatumbo and Choco.

The Colombian Congress agreed to prosecute AUC leaders under the controversial Justice and Peace Law, by which the paramilitary leaders would receive reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony and declarations of their entire criminal activity: links with drug dealers, assassinations, disappearances and massacres. These declarations are to be brought before a specialized judge, in a public hearing attended by the victims. The paramilitary leaders are also forced to &quot;repair&quot; the damage caused to the victims or their families: By disclosing the location of mass graves and by repaying each of them through economic assistance. As of 2008, these public hearings are still underway.

To improve its results in the fight against guerrilla warfare, the Colombian army carried out mass executions of civilians transformed into false positives. If exactions of this kind already existed, the phenomenon became widespread from 2002, encouraged by the bonuses paid to the soldiers and by quasi-absolute impunity. In 2010 a mass grave containing 2,000 corpses was discovered near a military base in the department of Meta. This is the largest mass grave discovered to date in South America.

In 2008, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nation&#x27;s Human Rights Council criticised the continuation of forced disappearances in Colombia.

According to the CODHES human rights NGO, forced displacement during Uribe&#x27;s term affected over 2.4 million Colombian nationals by the end of 2009. A spokesperson for the organization stated: &quot;It&#x27;s true that there have been advances for some segments of society, but not for everyone, which casts into doubt the democratic component of (the government&#x27;s) security policy&quot;. From 2000 to 2008, more than 130.000 Colombian nationals fled to Ecuador. According to the International Displacement Monitoring Centre, an estimated total of 3.303.979 to 4.915.579 people have been internally displaced in Colombia.

===Colombian parapolitics scandal===

In November 2006, a political crisis emerged as several of Uribe&#x27;s congressional supporters were questioned or charged by the Colombian Supreme Court and the office of the Attorney General for having alleged links to paramilitary groups. Álvaro Araújo, brother of Uribe&#x27;s Foreign Minister María Consuelo Araújo, was among those summoned for questioning. In November, the former ambassador to Chile, Salvador Arana, was charged with the murder of a mayor in a small town in the Department of Sucre. The Supreme Court sentenced Arana to 40 years in prison in December 2009.

In April 2007, Senator Gustavo Petro made several accusations against Uribe during a televised congressional debate about paramilitarism in Antioquia. Petro said that some of the Uribe family&#x27;s farms in the north of the country had been previously used as staging grounds for paramilitary forces. He also showed a picture of Santiago Uribe, the President&#x27;s brother, together with Fabio Ochoa, a drug dealer, in 1985. Petro also argued that Governor Uribe&#x27;s office allowed paramilitary personnel to participate in some of the legal cooperative neighborhood watch groups known as CONVIVIR. Another accusation concerned the possible participation of a helicopter belonging to the former Antioquia Governor&#x27;s administration during a paramilitary massacre.

Two days later, Uribe publicly revealed that former US Vice President Al Gore had canceled his participation in a pro-environment event Uribe was to attend in Miami due to the continuing allegations against him. The Colombian President reacted by organizing a press conference during which he addressed several of the accusations Senator Petro and others had made against him. Uribe argued that his family had nothing to do with any massacres and that they had already sold the implicated farms several years before the alleged events. He also stated that the Uribes and the Ochoas were both famous in the horse breeding business, causing their meetings to be both common and public. He claimed that the helicopter&#x27;s hours and missions had been strictly logged, making it impossible for it to have participated in any massacre. Uribe said that he supported the CONVIVIR groups but was not solely responsible for their creation, adding that other civilian and military authorities also participated in their oversight. He also said that he dismantled some CONVIVIR groups when doubts began to surround their activities.

On 22 April 2008, former senator Mario Uribe Escobar, one of the Colombian President&#x27;s cousins and a close political ally, was arrested after being denied asylum at the Costa Rican embassy in Bogotá, as part of a judicial inquiry into the links between politicians and paramilitary groups. Mario Uribe has been accused of meeting with paramilitary commander Salvatore Mancuso in order to plan land seizures. On 22 February 2011, Uribe Escobar was convicted and sentenced to 90 months in jail after the Colombian Supreme Court found him guilty of the charge of conspiring with paramilitary groups.

On 23 April 2008, Uribe revealed that a former paramilitary fighter had accused him of helping to plan the 1997 massacre of El Aro, a charge which he said was under official investigation. Uribe described the accuser as a &quot;disgruntled convict with an axe to grind&quot;, denied the charges and said there was proof of his innocence. The Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the paramilitary in question, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hernández, had not mentioned Uribe during previous declarations made more than five years ago, when he was sentenced for his own role in the massacre. The magazine also listed a number of possible inconsistencies in his most recent testimony, including the alleged presence of General Manosalva, who had died months before the date of the meeting where the massacre was planned.

===Wiretapping scandal===
In May 2009 Colombian prosecutors officially began an investigation on a series of illegal wiretapping and spying activities carried out against opposition politicians, judges, journalists and others by the Administrative Department of Security (DAS). The probe has involved several of Uribe&#x27;s top aides and former high-ranking personnel within the department.

Former DAS counterintelligence director Jorge Alberto Lagos has told investigators that information on the country&#x27;s Supreme Court judges was provided to Bernardo Moreno and José Obdulio, two of Uribe&#x27;s aides. Gaviria has claimed that criminals have tried to damage the government&#x27;s image as part of a &quot;political war&quot; against the administration. &quot;El Tiempo&quot; has criticized these explanations, raising questions about the President&#x27;s knowledge of these activities. Uribe himself has denied ordering any illegal wiretapping and claims that those responsible for spying on the opposition are part of &quot;a mafia group that hurts the Colombian Democracy, freedom, the country and the government itself&quot;.

The DAS, an &quot;intelligence service that answers to the president&quot; as described by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, has been the subject of earlier controversies during the Uribe administration. According to &quot;Revista Semana&quot;, revelations about the infiltration of paramilitaries affected the entity under former DAS chief Jorge Noguera in 2007 and further accusations have continued to surface. The magazine reported that information gathered by the DAS has been allegedly forwarded to paramilitaries, narcotraffickers and guerrillas.

Previously, former DAS computer systems chief Rafael García had claimed that the department and Colombian paramilitaries were involved in a plan to assassinate Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.

According to Reporters Without Borders, Colombia was demoted from 114th to 145th place between 2002 and 2010 on freedom of the press.

===International relations===

Uribe&#x27;s administration was responsible for arresting and extraditing more drug traffickers to the United States and to other countries than all other previous presidents. He has been publicly recognized as a supporter of the US war on drugs by continually implementing the anti-drug strategy of Plan Colombia.

He is also recognized as a supporter of the US war on terror, and the invasion of Iraq. In January 2003, Uribe ended a radio interview by asking &quot;why isn&#x27;t there any thought of [making] an equivalent deployment [as in the invasion of Iraq] to put an end to this problem [the Colombian conflict], which has such potentially grave consequences?&quot;.

In a 22 November visit to the coastal city of Cartagena, US President George W. Bush stood by the results of Uribe&#x27;s security policies and declared he would continue to provide Plan Colombia aid in the future: &quot;My nation will continue to help Colombia prevail in this vital struggle. Since the year 2000, when we began Plan Colombia, the United States has provided more than $3 billion in vital aid. We&#x27;ll continue providing aid. We&#x27;ve helped Colombia to strengthen its democracy, to combat drug production, to create a more transparent and effective judicial system, to increase the size and professionalism of its military and police forces, to protect human rights, and to reduce corruption. Mr. President, you and your government have not let us down. Plan Colombia enjoys wide bipartisan support in my country, and next year I will ask our Congress to renew its support so that this courageous nation can win its war against narco-terrorists&quot;.

The Uribe administration has maintained generally positive diplomatic relations with Spain and most Latin American nations. It signed several accords, including one in 2004 for the joint construction of a pipeline with Venezuela, a security and anti-drug trafficking cooperation deal with Paraguay in 2005, a commercial and technological cooperation agreement with Bolivia in 2004, a defense agreement with Spain (which was modified in 2004 but still remained valid), and economic and cultural agreements with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in April 2005.

Several analysts consider that, being an ally of the US, Uribe would be ideologically opposed to left-wing governments in Latin America and elsewhere. Yet, Uribe has participated in multilateral meetings and has held bilateral summits with presidents Hugo Chávez, Martín Torrijos, Lula da Silva, Ricardo Lagos, and Carlos Mesa, among others. Colombia has also maintained diplomatic relations with Cuba and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

There have been some diplomatic incidents and crises with Venezuela during his term, in particular around the 2005 Rodrigo Granda affair, Colombia&#x27;s frustrated 2004 acquisition of 46 AMX-30 tanks from Spain, and an Alleged planned Venezuelan coup in 2004 by Colombian paramilitaries. These internationally worrying circumstances have been ultimately resolved through the use of official diplomatic channels and bilateral presidential summits (in the first two cases).
International law enforcement cooperation has been maintained with countries such as the US, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Panama, Paraguay, Honduras and Brazil among others.

Uribe&#x27;s government, along with Peru and Ecuador, negotiated and (with Peru) signed a free trade agreement with the US. On 30 December 2005, Uribe signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with Mercosur and gives Colombian products preferential access to the market of 230 million people. Trade negotiations have also been underway with Mexico, Chile, the Andean community and the USA over its current proposal.

After the 2009 Honduran election Uribe joined a list of leaders that are supporting the next government following the coup d&#x27;état. &quot;Colombia recognizes the next government&quot;, Uribe told reporters during an Ibero-American summit in Portugal on 30 November 2009. &quot;A democratic process has taken place in Honduras with high participation, without fraud&quot;.

In 2009, bilateral negotiations between the United States and Colombia which would give U.S. forces increased access to several Colombian military bases for the stated purpose of fighting terrorism and the drug trade generated controversy throughout the region. Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez criticized the proposed deal as the creation of a purported &quot;imperialist beachhead&quot; while Colombian diplomats defended the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that &quot;there was no intention to expand the number of permanent [U.S.] personnel [in Colombia] beyond the maximum permitted by Congress&quot;. Other Latin American nations, including Brazil, also expressed their own concerns about the matter.

On 2 July 2008 a covert rescue operation codenamed Operation Jaque by the Colombian Special Forces disguised as FARC guerrillas resulted in the rescue of Senator and former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, the Americans Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell and eleven soldiers and police officers. It was done without bloodshed and led to the capture of two guerrilla leaders. The operation heightened Uribe&#x27;s already soaring popularity. Uribe stated that the rescue operation &quot;was guided in every way by the light of the Holy Spirit, the protection of our Lord and the Virgin Mary&quot;. The hostages agreed, indicating that they had spent much time in captivity praying the rosary, and Ms. Betancourt, formerly a lapsed Catholic who prayed daily on a wooden rosary which she made while a hostage, attributed the rescue as follows: &quot;I am convinced this is a miracle of the Virgin Mary. To me it is clear she has had a hand in all of this&quot;.

Despite significant political differences, until 2007 Colombia and Venezuela had only one major impasse in their relations, the Rodrigo Granda affair, which had been overcome thanks to the direct talks between Uribe and Chávez. Uribe&#x27;s main political problem during 2007 was his handling of the humanitarian exchange situation: the FARC guerrillas held over 700 hostages, living in poor conditions in the Colombian jungle. These hostages included presidential candidate and French citizen Ingrid Betancourt (later freed), three American citizens (later freed), and several Colombian politicians and law enforcers. Some of the captives had been in the jungle for over 10 years. For the release of 40 of these hostages (the so-called &quot;canjeables&quot; or &quot;exchangeables&quot;) the FARC demands a Demilitarized Zone that includes the towns of Florida and Pradera. The government has refused to comply with this demand, deciding instead to push for a military rescue of the hostages, or by searching the mediation of third parties like Switzerland and the Catholic Church.

As all of those plans failed to get any positive outcome, Uribe appointed Senator Piedad Córdoba to mediate between the government and the guerrillas in an attempt to secure the liberation of the hostages. Córdoba then asked Chávez to mediate as well, with Uribe&#x27;s consent. French president Nicolas Sarkozy was also willing to help in the mediation effort.

On 8 November 2007 Chávez met with alias &quot;Iván Márquez&quot; one of the highest members of the FARC and some other members of its secretariat at the Palacio de Miraflores in a widely publicized event. After the event Chavez promised to deliver evidence that some of the hostages remained alive. When Chávez met with Sarkozy on 19 November, Chávez was still waiting for the evidence. Lacking the &quot;proof of life&quot; that was promised to the families of the hostages, and seeing prominent FARC members using the media attention to promote their own ideology, Uribe became disgruntled with the mediation process.

On 22 November Uribe abruptly ended the mediation after Chávez spoke with the high command of the Colombian military during a call made by Córdoba. Uribe had warned Chávez against any attempt to talk to military high command. Chávez initially accepted the decision, but tensions escalated as the presidents increasingly attacked each other verbally, with Chávez claiming that Uribe and the U.S. simply preferred the war continue, and Uribe implying Chávez supported the rebels.

Chávez announced a &quot;freeze&quot; of political relations and called Uribe a &quot;pawn of the empire&quot; and cut contact with the Colombian government, including rejecting calls from the Colombian embassy in Caracas. He announced his intent to sharply reduce bilateral commerce.

Chávez continued negotiating with the rebels and eventually secured the unilateral release of two, then four more, hostages to Venezuela which were meant as signs of good faith and preceded calls for more negotiations, which Uribe dismissed.

A regional crisis began after Colombian troops killed FARC commander Raúl Reyes in a guerrilla camp inside Ecuadorian borders on 1 March. Ecuador, Venezuela and Nicaragua, which has a maritime dispute with Colombia, cut diplomatic ties with Colombia as a response, with Chavez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa ordering troops to their respective borders with Colombia. Uribe in response placed the armed forces on high alert but did not move his troops to confront them even though the Colombian army is larger than Ecuador&#x27;s and Venezuela&#x27;s combined.

Several countries in the Americas criticized the incursion into Ecuador as a violation of national sovereignty, which was also denounced by an OAS resolution. The United States backed Colombia&#x27;s position and internal support for the action remained strong, Uribe&#x27;s popularity rising as a result.

The impasse was finally solved when Leonel Fernández, President of the Dominican Republic, hosted an emergency summit of Latin American nations in Santo Domingo. He got Uribe, Correa, and Chavez to shake hands. Nicaragua&#x27;s Daniel Ortega also announced the restoration of relations with Colombia at which Uribe told him that he would send him the bill for the plane fare for his ambassador.

In early March 2010, Judge Eloy Velasco of Spain brought forth allegations against Hugo Chávez, the FARC and ETA of conspiring to assassinate Uribe, along with other Colombian political figures.

===Socio-economic policy===
The Uribe administration continuously dealt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, securing loans, agreeing to cut expenses, continue debt payments, privatize public companies, and foment investor confidence to comply with financial orthodoxy.

Companies such as Carbocol, Telecom Colombia, Bancafé, Minercol, and others, which were either already in crisis or considered by the government as overly expensive to maintain under their current spending conditions, were among those restructured or privatized.

Most direct critics have considered Uribe&#x27;s administration a key example of a government favoring neoliberal economic policies and argued that it has not addressed the root causes of poverty and unemployment, because continued application of traditional trade and tax policies tend to benefit private and foreign investors over small owners and workers. Unions and labor groups claim that many privatizations and liquidations were done to please the IMF, the World Bank, and multinational companies, and hurt various national industries in the long run.

Colombia&#x27;s debt gradually increased yearly; while it stood at 52% of GDP in 2003, it reached 72% in 2010.

Unemployment remained at a high level (between 11 and 12%) under Uribe&#x27;s administration.

===Referendum for reelection===
A national referendum was promoted during Uribe&#x27;s campaign and later modified by Congress and judicial review. The ability to revoke Congress was removed, as was the option to vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; as a whole. The modified proposal was defeated at the polls on 25 October 2003, and several left-wing candidates opposed to the referendum were victorious at regional elections the following day. At least 25% of the electorate needed to vote on each of the 15 proposals in order it to be accepted, but overall participation was only 24.8% and only the first proposal (&quot;political death for the corrupt&quot;) achieved this. All 15 proposals were approved by a substantial majority of those who voted.

Analysts considered these events a political setback for Uribe, as one of his main campaign propositions had failed, despite his personal leadership. The &quot;active abstention&quot; and blank voting campaigns that his opponents, in particular the Independent Democratic Pole and the Colombian Liberal Party, had promoted were allegedly successful in convincing enough of their sympathizers to stay home and instead participate in the next day&#x27;s round of elections.

A number of Uribe&#x27;s own supporters did not participate, as they found the referendum, which had been modified by Congress and later by the Judicial branch, to be too complex, long and uninspiring. Some also pointed out that extraordinary electoral initiatives (that is, those voted outside standard electoral dates) have traditionally suffered complications in Colombia, including a lack of participation.

In September 2003, Uribe issued a speech that contained allegations against what he called &quot;agents of terrorism&quot; inside a minority of human rights organizations, while at the same time declaring that he respected criticism from most other established organizations and sources. Similar statements were later repeated in other instances.
These statements were sharply criticized inside and outside Colombia because they could endanger the work of human rights and opposition figures.

Contacts begun in 2002 with the paramilitary AUC forces and their leader Carlos Castaño, which had publicly expressed their will to declare a cease-fire, continued in 2003 amid a degree of national and international controversy.

===Reelection proposal===
In 2004, Uribe successfully sought a Congressional amendment to the Colombian Constitution of 1991 which allowed him to run for a second term as president. For years, Colombian presidents had been limited to a single four-year term and had been barred from any sort of reelection, even if nonconsecutive. Uribe originally had expressed his disagreement with consecutive reelection during his campaign, but later changed his mind, first at a private level and later in public appearances.

Many analysts considered that, in order to secure the approval of this reform, Uribe may have slacked on his campaign promises, because of what has been perceived as his indirect bribing of congressmen, through the alleged assignment of their relatives to the diplomatic corps and through promises of investment in their regions of origin. Uribe&#x27;s supporters consider that no actual bribing took place, and that a consensus among the diverse sectors that back Uribe&#x27;s policies in Congress had to be reached through political negotiation.

The amendment permitting a single reelection was approved by Congress in December 2004, and by the Constitutional Court in October 2005.

===2006 presidential elections===

In 2004, Uribe&#x27;s political supporters amended the constitution to allow him to run for a second term, previously proscribed by the Colombian constitution, and his own decision to run for a second term was announced in late 2005. With this amendment, Uribe was re-elected on 28 May 2006 for a second presidential term (2006–2010), and became the first president to be consecutively re-elected in Colombia in over a century. He received about 62% of the vote, winning over 7.3 million votes. This was the largest victory for a presidential candidate in Colombian history.

The Organization of American States (OAS) deployed electoral observers in 12 departments: Antioquia, Risaralda, Quindío, Atlántico, Bolívar, Santander, Córdoba, Cauca, César, Nariño, Magdalena and Valle. In a statement made on 28 May, OAS mentioned that the elections &quot;have taken place in an atmosphere of freedom, transparency and normalcy&quot;, despite incidents &quot;related to the use of indelible ink, voter substitution and the accreditation of electoral witnesses, though these have no effect on the electoral process as a whole&quot; and &quot;developments in northern Santander province that took the lives of army personnel and left others injured in an ambush carried out by subversive groups&quot;.

===Bribery investigation===

In April 2008, Yidis Medina, a former congresswoman from the pro-government Colombian Conservative Party, claimed that members of Uribe&#x27;s administration had offered her to appoint local officials in her home province, in exchange for voting in favor of the 2004 reelection bill. According to Medina, the government had not fulfilled that promise, prompting her declaration. The Attorney General of Colombia ordered her arrest, after which she turned herself over to authorities and testified to the Supreme Court as part of the investigation. The opposition Alternative Democratic Pole party asked for Uribe to be investigated for bribery. After the declarations made by Medina, the Supreme Court of Colombia sent copies of the process to other judicial authorities, who have the jurisdiction to investigate several former and current cabinet members and other high officials. The Accusations Commission of the Colombian Congress will study the matter and decide if there are enough merits to officially investigate Uribe.

===Popularity===
Since his 2002 election Uribe&#x27;s approval ratings had remained high, usually staying between 60 and 70 percent after eight years in office, but this status has radically changed.

During early 2008, Uribe&#x27;s approval rating hit 81%, one of the highest popularity levels of his entire presidency. In June 2008, after Operation Jaque, Uribe&#x27;s approval rate rose to an unprecedented 91%. In May 2009 his popularity had dropped to 68%.

According to a June 2009 Ipsos-Napoleón Franco national poll for the 2010 presidential campaign, covering over thirty cities and municipalities, Uribe&#x27;s overall approval rating was 76% but only 57% would vote in favor of his potential reelection for a third term.

During the eight years of Uribe&#x27;s government, internal polling, communications strategy and government and presidential image were managed by Uribe&#x27;s Communications Advisors Jaime Bermudez, who later became Ambassador to Argentina and then Foreign Affairs Minister; Jorge Mario Eastman, who was Vice-minister of Defense before and left to become Vice-minister of Defense again; and Mauricio Carradini who served under Uribe until the end the period in office.

Uribe&#x27;s popularity on leaving office was measured to be between 79% and 84% depending on the source consulted. However, those opinion polls in Colombia were mostly carried out among the inhabitants of big cities and did not include the opinion of rural populations, most affected by war and poverty. Some journalists were also surprised that the president&#x27;s popularity is not reflected in the elections, where the abstention varies between 50% and 80% of the electorate.

In 2019, 69% of the population surveyed said they had an unfavourable image of Uribe, while 26% said they had a favourable image.

===2010 third term proposal===
As the end of Uribe&#x27;s second term approached, his followers sought a new amendment that would grant him the right to run for a third term.

In May 2009, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos resigned so he could run for president in case Uribe either did not or could not run again. Santos said before resigning that he did not want to run against Uribe.

Congress backed a proposed referendum on the matter, but the Constitutional Court rejected it after reviewing the resulting law. On 26 February 2010 lead justice Mauricio Gonzalez publicly announced the Court&#x27;s decision. Gonzalez said that the Court had found numerous irregularities in the way signatures were obtained to allow the referendum to pass. He also said that the law calling for a referendum contained &quot;substantial violations to the democratic principle&quot; that made it unconstitutional. Uribe stated that he would respect the decision but called for voters to continue supporting his administration&#x27;s policies in the upcoming elections.

The Constitutional Court not only threw out the referendum, but declared Colombian presidents could only serve two terms, even if they were nonconsecutive. This effectively foreclosed a potential Uribe run for president in 2014. The Constitution has since been amended to limit the president to a single four-year term, restoring the status quo that prevailed before 2005.

==Post-presidency==
In late 2010, a few months after leaving office, Uribe was named visiting scholar at Georgetown University&#x27;s Walsh School of Foreign Service, where he taught students in different disciplines as a guest lecturer in seminars and classes. In 2011, Uribe was granted an honorary award by the Latin American Student Association of Georgetown, for his leadership and commitment with the Latin American community of the university.

Uribe&#x27;s appointment at Georgetown sparked controversy. In September, more than 150 scholars, including 10 Georgetown professors and leading experts on Latin America and Colombia, signed a letter calling for Uribe&#x27;s firing. A Colombian humorist suggested Uribe teach a course on wiretapping, which his administration illegally conducted on opposition figures, human rights workers, journalists and Supreme Court justices. Many students protested, with some hanging banners calling him a &quot;mass murderer&quot; for the deaths of thousands of civilians that the army was accused of later dressing up as guerrillas.

In November 2010, while at the Georgetown campus, Uribe was served a criminal subpoena in the case &quot;Claudia Balcero Giraldo v. Drummond&quot;, regarding hundreds of civilians murdered by paramilitary forces loyal to Uribe.

After a year at Georgetown, Uribe left to continue with his personal endeavors in Colombia.

In October 2012, News Corporation welcomed Uribe to the Board of Directors upon the retirement of Andrew Knight, John Thornton, and Arthur Siskind.

In 2012, Uribe joined the Leadership Council of Concordia, a nonprofit organization in New York City that creates public-private partnerships.

Prosecutors accuse Uribe of helping to plan paramilitary massacres in La Granja (1996), San Roque (1996) and El Aro (1997) while he was governor of Antioquia, and the February 1998 assassination of Jesús María Valle, an attorney and human rights defender working with victims in those cases.

===Senator of Colombia (2014–2020)===
Uribe, who had served in the Senate prior to his election as president, is the only former Colombian head of state in history to have become a Senator after occupying the presidency.

Founded by the former president, the Democratic Center (Centro Democrático) party managed to win 20 seats in the Senate during 9 March congressional election, the second highest number after the 21 seats held by President Juan Manuel Santos U Party (Partido de la U). Uribe&#x27;s new Democratic Center party also won 19 of the House of Representatives&#x27; 166 seats.

Uribe campaigned actively against the peace deal between the Juan Manuel Santos administration and FARC. He argued the deal would undermine the constitution by appointing FARC leaders, who received no prison terms for their crimes, to congress.

===Home detention===
In August 2020, Uribe was placed under house arrest at his hacienda &quot;El Ubérrimo&quot; by the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia, as part of ongoing judicial invenstigations into El Aro and La Granja massacres, which took place while he was Governor of Antioquia. Uribe&#x27;s detention marked the first time in Colombian history that a court had detained a former president. The day following his arrest, Uribe tested positive for COVID-19, but he announced he was cured six days later. On 18 August 2020, Uribe resigned his seat in the Senate of Colombia. Uribe was later released on 10 October 2020, after the Supreme Court ruled that there was a lack of evidence to suggest he engaged in witness tampering.

Another court case called &quot;Caso Uribe&quot; was also levied against Uribe. It was a dispute in which Uribe began as a victim ended as a victimizer, according to the status granted by the high court to his counterpart in this process, Senator Iván Cepeda.

The process passed into the hands of the Office of the Colombian Attorney General, thus evading the jurisdiction that the Supreme Court of Justice had over it. The prosecutor delegated to this high court, Gabriel Jaimes Durán, requested the preclusion of the process, ruling in a four-month investigation on the probative material that the court compiled over the course of three years.

In May 2024, Uribe was formally charged with witness tampering and bribery in the Caso Uribe, following the release of wiretapped phone conversations in which he was heard discussing efforts to reverse two former paramilitaries who were set to testify against him with one of his lawyers.

===&quot;False positives&quot; scandal===
In 2008, the case of so-called false positives, or extrajudicial executions, was revealed. Several Army brigades created a policy, according to which commanders and soldiers reporting combat casualties, received prizes, vacations and promotions, while commanders who did not report results were disciplined and punished. Such policy did not reward the military for capturing guerrillas but for reporting the death toll in combat. It subsequently came to light that several National Army units executed civilians, often from a poor background, to pass them off as combat casualties and thus inflate the number of deaths in combat, which sought to demonstrate the success of the &quot;democratic security&quot; policy. The killings were systematically committed by several National Army units as the fourth brigade in Medellin, which lured young people under the pretext of employing them, thus murdering them in the field simulating combat.

In December 2019, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace discovered the first mass grave of false positives in the municipality of Dabeiba, Antioquia, where 50 civilian deaths were found, presented as guerrillas who were killed by National Army units during the Uribe government between 2006 and 2008. Those responsible for digging the tombs were soldiers of the Fourth Brigade of Medellin, located less than three hours away by car from Dabeiba. It is estimated that across the country there are between 3,500 and 10,000 victims of false positives in what Human Rights Watch has called as a case of unreleased human rights violation in the world where the army murders its own civilians to pass them off as enemies killed in combat.

Such a violation of human rights by the Army entailed the resignation of the National Army Commander at the time, General Mario Montoya, who would subsequently benefit from special jurisdiction after requesting that such entity could ensure his personal security. 
For these crimes, several international analysts have considered Uribe to be at risk of trial for crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court or for War Crimes. Currently, the prosecutor&#x27;s office of the International Criminal Court has information on 2,047 cases of execution of civilians by the National Army. In February 2021, the Special Peace Jurisdiction has claimed that, during Uribe&#x27;s rule, 6,402 people were victims of this scourge.

In 2021, the president of the Truth Commission, Francisco de Roux, demanded from him to ask for forgiveness due to its responsibility in the events related to the False Positives, but Uribe declined even the invitation to talk with the commission.

===Other awards===

In 2007, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) gave Uribe its &quot;Light unto the nations&quot; award. AJC President E. Robert Goodkind, who presented the award at AJC&#x27;s Annual Dinner held at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., stated: &quot;President Uribe is a staunch ally of the United States, a good friend of Israel and the Jewish people, and is a firm believer in human dignity and human development in Colombia and the Americas&quot;.

In January 2009 US President George W. Bush awarded Uribe, along with former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard, the highest civilian award; Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dana Perino, the White House Press Secretary explained that he received this award &quot;for [his] work to improve the lives of [his] citizens and for [his] efforts to promote democracy, human rights and peace abroad&quot;. She said (speaking of the three leaders who received the reward on this day): &quot;All three leaders have been staunch allies of the United States, particularly in combating terrorism&quot;.

In November 2009 Nicolas De Santis, President of Gold Mercury International, presented Uribe with the Gold Mercury International Award for Peace and Security in a ceremony at the House of Nariño in Bogotá. The Award recognized Uribe&#x27;s efforts to transform Colombia&#x27;s internal security mechanisms, improve human rights, social cohesion and general development of the country.

<text>Ilmarinen (, also known as Ilmari and takoja iänikuinen or &quot;the eternal hammerer&quot;), a blacksmith and inventor in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, is a god and archetypal artificer from Finnish mythology. He is immortal and capable of creating practically anything. In addition, he is described as working the known metals of the time, including brass, copper, iron, gold, and silver. The great works of Ilmarinen include the crafting of the dome of the sky and the forging of the Sampo. His usual epithet in the Kalevala is &quot;seppä&quot; or &quot;seppo&quot; (&quot;smith&quot;), which is the source of the given name Seppo.

== Etymology and origin ==

Cognates of the Finnish word &quot;ilma&quot; (&#x27;air&#x27;) are attested in almost all the main Finno-Ugric languages apart from the Mari and Mordvinic languages, allowing the reconstruction of proto-Finno-Ugric *&quot;ilma&quot; meaning something like &#x27;sky&#x27;. This noun is also attested as the name of a god in Khanty (&quot;Num-Iləm&quot;), Komi (&quot;Jen&quot;), Udmurt (&quot;Inmar&quot;) and the Finnic languages, suggesting that proto-Finno-Ugric likewise had a sky god credited with creating the sky called *&quot;Ilma&quot;. In Proto-Finnic, the suffix -&quot;r(i)&quot;, which is used to form words for people associated with the root word, was added to *&quot;ilma&quot; to give the god-name *&quot;Ilmar(i)&quot; (&#x27;Sky-being&#x27;); rare attestations of similar forms such as Udmurt &quot;Ilmar&quot; and Sámi &quot;Ilmaris&quot; seem to be loans from Finnic. In Kalevala metre poetry, the diminutive suffix -&quot;nen&quot; enabled the formation of the name &quot;Ilmarinen&quot;, which neatly fills two trochaic feet and so became the dominant form of the name in that tradition.

Ilmari(nen) is believed to have taken on the qualities of a smith through the Proto-Finnic contact with iron-working cultures, such as the Indo-European Balts or speakers of Common Germanic.

Ilmarinen is also directly appealed to for aid in several incantation runes. Insofar as Elias Lönnrot heavily redacted the original runes collected by him and others, it&#x27;s valuable to differentiate between the Kalevala and the original poems sung by .
Other names for Ilmarinen that are found in rune variants include &quot;Ilmorinen&quot; and &quot;Ilmollini&quot;.

== Stories about Ilmarinen ==

===The forging of the Sampo===
====From the Kalevala====
:&quot;Summary based on &quot;
When the old sage, Väinämöinen, was traveling wide in the search of a wife, he was captured by the old mistress of Pohjola, the land of the North. In return for giving him safe passage from the land of Pohjola back to his native country, the enchantress Louhi of Pohjola wanted to have made the Sampo, a magic artifact. Väinämöinen replied that he could not make her one, but that Ilmarinen could, and promised to send the great smith to Pohjola to do just that. In return for this wondrous device, Louhi would also give Ilmarinen her daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage.

On having returned home, Väinämöinen tries to awe Ilmarinen with tales of the maiden&#x27;s beauty and so lure him to Pohjola. Ilmarinen sees through the ruse, however, and refuses. Not to be outdone, Väinämöinen tricks the smith into climbing a fir tree trying to bring down moonlight that is glimmering on the branches. Conjuring a storm-wind with his magical song, Väinämöinen then blows Ilmarinen away to Pohjola.

Once there, Ilmarinen is approached by the toothless hag, Louhi, and her daughter, the Maiden of Pohjola, and having seen the maiden&#x27;s beauty, consents to build a Sampo. For three days, he sought a place to build a great forge. In that forge he placed metals and started working, tending the magic fire with help of the slaves of Pohjola.

On the first day, Ilmarinen looked down into the flames and saw that the metal had taken the form of a crossbow with a golden arch, a copper shaft and quarrel-tips of silver. But the bow had an evil spirit, asking for a new victim each day, and so Ilmarinen broke it and cast the pieces back into the fire.

On the second day, there came a metal ship from the fire, with ribs of gold and copper oars. Though beautiful to behold, it too was evil at heart, being too eager to rush towards battle, and so, Ilmarinen broke the magic boat apart and cast back the pieces once more.

On the third day, a metal cow emerged, with golden horns and the sun and the stars on its brow. But alas, it was ill-tempered, and so the magical heifer was broken into pieces and melted down.

On the fourth day, a golden plow is pulled from the forge, with a golden plowshare, a copper beam and silver handles. But it too is flawed, plowing up planted fields and furrowing meadows. In despair, Ilmarinen destroys his creation once more.

Angered at his lack of success, Ilmarinen conjures the four winds to fan the flames. The winds blow for three days, until finally, the Sampo is born, taking the shape of a magic mill that produces grain, salt and gold. Pleased with his creation at last, Ilmarinen presents it to Louhi, who promptly locks it in a vault deep underground.

Returning triumphant to the Maiden of Pohjola, Ilmarinen bids her to become his wife. To his dismay, she refuses to leave her native land, forcing him to return home alone and dejected.

====From original rune variants====
Variants of the original runes used by Lönnrot in compiling the Kalevala present a different picture of Ilmarinen. In one variant of The Sampo for example, Ilmarinen goes willingly to Pohjola to forge the Sampo, not because he was tricked by Väinämöinen, but in order to redeem Väinämöinen from death. In addition, the same rune portrays Ilmarinen as returning home successfully with the Maiden of the North.

Ilmarinen&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;unlucky in love&quot; in the Kalevala is primarily due to Lönnrot&#x27;s own choices while revising and compiling the original runes to form a cohesive narrative. In another example from an original rune entitled &quot;Kosinta&quot; (The Courtship), Ilmarinen takes a journey to compete for Hiisi&#x27;s daughter. He again succeeds in obtaining his wife after completing the tasks of ploughing a field of vipers, bringing Tuoni&#x27;s bear, and bringing the pike of Tuoni.

===Ilmarinen&#x27;s bride of gold===

====From the Kalevala====
:&quot;Summary based on &quot;
After the loss of his first wife to Kullervo&#x27;s curse, the disheartened Ilmarinen attempts to craft a new one from gold and silver, but finds the golden wife hard and cold. Dismayed, he attempts to wed her to his brother Väinämöinen instead, but the old sage rejects her, saying that the golden wife ought to be cast back into the furnace and tells Ilmarinen to &quot;forge from her a thousand trinkets&quot;. Speaking to all of his people, he further adds:

&quot;Never, youths, however wretched,

Nor in future, upgrown heroes,

Whether you have large possessions,

Or are poor in your possessions,

In the course of all your lifetime,

While the golden moon is shining,

May you woo a golden woman,

Or distress yourselves for silver,

For the gleam of gold is freezing,

Only frost is breathed by silver.&quot;
The tale of the Golden Wife can be seen as a cautionary tale based on the theme of &quot;money cannot buy happiness&quot;. To a contemporary reader, there is also a similarity to the hubristic nature of the Golem legend, or to &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, in that even the most skilled of mortals cannot rival divine perfection when creating life.

====From original rune variants====
In another example of Lönnrot&#x27;s editorial license, the Kullervo cycle originally existed as an independent series of runes. In his effort to create a homogeneous narrative, Lönnrot presented Kullervo as Ilmarinen&#x27;s slave in order to insert Kullervo into the Sampo cycle of runes. However, some scholars are convinced that the Golden Bride was originally an independent rune that was eventually added to the Sampo cycle. Furthermore, independent variants of the &quot;Kultamorsian&quot; (Golden Bride) rune have been collected. In Matti Kuusi&#x27;s opinion, the warning reproduced above is a secondary element that was probably added during the Christian period. Rather than serving as a cautionary tale, the original runes probably expressed the widespread myth of a Golden Woman found throughout Arctic Eurasia.

==In popular culture==

*A portrayal of Ilmarinen and depiction of selected tales from the Kalevala can be found in the 1959 movie Sampo (film).
*Finnish metal band Amorphis released their ninth album in 2009 called Skyforger, which is a concept album based around the stories and legends of Ilmarinen.
*The band Turisas recorded a song called &quot;Cursed Be Iron&quot; about the aforementioned smith, and he is mentioned in &quot;Rauta&quot; by Korpiklaani.
*In the trilogy &quot;The Winter of the World&quot; by Michael Scott Rohan, Ilmarinen is the godlike Power revered by the duergar, who say he forged the mountains in which they live. Another Power, the Odin-like Raven, speaks of Ilmarinen, &quot;greatest of the Elder Powers,&quot; having taught him.
*Ilmarinen appears in Joseph Michael Linsner&#x27;s comic &quot;Dawn: Return of the Goddess&quot; when the title character seeks him out to forge a sword for her.
*Ilmarinen appears as Ilmari Heikkinen the Wonder-smith in Mercedes Lackey&#x27;s 500 Kingdoms Series&#x27; homage to Sámi (among other Scandinavian and northern European) myths and legends, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (2008).

<doc id="243684" wikidata="Q6671861" url="?curid=243684" title="Lists of long-distance trails in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>These are lists of long-distance trails in the Republic of Ireland, and include recognised and maintained walking trails, pilgrim trails, cycling greenways, boardwalk-mountain trails, and interconnected national and international trail systems.

There are 43 National Waymarked Trails by the &#x27;National Trails Office&#x27; of the Irish Sports Council. Each trail is waymarked with square black posts containing an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow, a symbol reserved for use only by National Waymarked Trails. The oldest trail in the Republic of Ireland is the Wicklow Way, which was opened in 1980, and there are now over of waymarked trails in the Republic alone. The most frequented trails are the Wicklow, Sheep&#x27;s Head, Kerry, Dingle, Beara, Burren and Western Ways.

In 1997, the Heritage Council, started developing a series of walking routes based on medieval pilgrimage paths, and there are now of major penitential trails: Cnoc na dTobar, Cosán na Naomh, St. Finbarr&#x27;s Pilgrim Path, Saint Kevin&#x27;s Way, and Tochar Phádraig. These pilgrim trails, and seven others, are supported by Pilgrim Paths of Ireland who follow the same guidelines for developing National Waymarked Trails.

In 2017, the 46-kilometre Waterford Greenway was opened for cyclists, and many others are planned or in development. Many of the National Waymarked Trails form part of larger long-distance and transnational trails such as European walking route E8, the Beara-Breifne Way and the International Appalachian Trail.

==National waymarked trails==

The establishment of the Ulster Way in Northern Ireland in the 1970s prompted the creation of the &quot;Cospóir Long Distance Walking Routes Committee&quot; (now the &#x27;National Trails Advisory Committee&#x27; of the Irish Sports Council) to establish a national network of long-distance trails in the Republic of Ireland. The committee included An Taisce nominee J. B. Malone, who had done much to popularise walking through an &quot;Evening Herald&quot; newspaper column, television programmes and books. The first trail in the Republic – the Wicklow Way – was based on a series of articles Malone had written for the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; in 1966, and was opened in 1980; it was followed by the South Leinster and East Munster Ways in 1984; the Kerry Way and the Táin Way in 1985; and the Dingle and Slieve Bloom Ways in 1987.

The work of the committee was not supported by compulsory powers, and access had to be achieved by agreement with local authorities and private landowners, which was not usually forthcoming. Most of the trails are therefore dependent on access from by the state: Coillte, the state-owned forestry company, is the largest single manager of any of the trails with more than 30 National Waymarked Trails making use of its property. Coillte provides and maintains 52% of all off-road walking trails and 24% of the total amount of developed walking trails in Ireland. Access issues mean that many trails have substantial sections on public roads. Author John G. O&#x27;Dwyer summed up the situation of trails using long stretches on boring public roads interspersed with monotone Coillte Sitka spruce forests.

A 2006 &quot;National Trails Strategy&quot;, by the Irish Sports Council, noted that Irish trails fell well behind international standards, and that access was &quot;the single most important&quot; issue. A 2010 review of the National Waymarked Trails by the Irish Sports Council restated many of these issues and made recommendations on a new standard of trail called a &#x27;National Long Distance Trail&#x27; (NLDT), intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails. Five trails – the Beara, Dingle, Kerry, Sheep&#x27;s Head and Wicklow Ways – were recommended to be upgraded to NLDT.

==Pilgrim paths==
Influenced by the work of the Council of Europe on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela in the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Pilgrim Paths Project&quot; was set up by the Heritage Council as its Millennium Project in 1997. The purpose was to develop and support a network of walking routes along Irish medieval pilgrimage paths to raise awareness of natural and built heritage along these routes and to contribute to tourism and community development.

In 2013, Pilgrim Paths of Ireland (PPI) was set up as a non-denominational representative body for Ireland&#x27;s medieval pilgrim paths, and represents 12 community groups supporting specific paths. PPI holds and annual &quot;National Pilgrimage Paths Week&quot; during Easter, and issues a &quot;National Pilgrimage Passport&quot; to finishers of the 5 main trails: Cnoc na dTobar, Cosán na Naomh, St. Finbarr&#x27;s Pilgrim Path, Saint Kevin&#x27;s Way, and Tochar Phádraig.

The routes follow the guidelines for National Waymarked Trails, with black marker posts with a yellow pilgrim symbol; this image is based on a stone from a pilgrimage site in County Cork which depicts a pilgrim with a Celtic tonsure, wearing a tunic and carrying a staff. Beneath the symbol is a directional arrow inset with a cross of arcs, one of the main symbols of pilgrimage in Ireland.

==Cycle greenways==

, there were four greenways (mostly rail trails) in the Republic of Ireland:

A project has been initiated to create an Connemara Greenway along the route of the former Galway to Clifden Midland Great Western Railway. The Dublin-Galway Greenway has also been initiated. The 280 km route was planned to be completed by 2020. Sections of the route follow the Royal Canal from Dublin, as well as the disused Mullingar-Athlone rail line. Funding was made available for the development of a greenway on the former Tralee to Fenit railway line in County Kerry, with (as of 2011) the development of further greenways under consideration in other parts of the country. There is also a campaign to create a greenway on the Claremorris, County Mayo to Collooney, County Sligo section of the Western Rail Corridor.

The Royal Canal Greenway is due to be extended along the Royal Canal to Dublin to an expanded length of .

==Boarded mountain paths==

The Irish Office of Public Works (OPW) maintains a number of &quot;boarded paths&quot;, often using railway sleepers, on some Irish mountains.

The driver of their creation has been to protect the underlying ground (often delicate bogland) from erosion by hill-walkers, however, in most cases, the creation of the paths has also materially increased the use and popularity of the paths by the public. When the &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was opened in 2015, it was estimated that visitors to Cuilcagh Mountain increased from circa 3,000 per annum, to over 60,000 per annum.

, there are five boarded mountain paths (also called &quot;Tóchars&quot; by the NPWS) in Ireland:

* Cuilcagh &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (Cavan/Fermanagh). A 7.5–kilometre boarded path to the summit of Cuilcagh mountain (e.g. a 15–kilometre round-trip), that was opened in 2015 to protect the underlying bog, but has since become a significant tourist attraction in the area.
* Diamond Hill. A 7–kilometre boarded and stone path round-trip trail that starts and ends at the National Park visitor centre in Letterfrack in Connemara. The mountain was closed to climbing in 2002 due to severe erosion but was re-opened in December 2005 after the completion of a Euro 1.4 million wooden boardwalk and stone path trail to limit further erosion; since construction, only Croagh Patrick has a higher footfall in Connemara mountains.
* Djouce (Wicklow). A 4–kilometre boarded path consisting of railway sleepers was constructed during 1997–1999 to protect the underlying bog from erosion due to the popularity of the mountain hill walking; the path does not go all the way to the summit, and instead, a gravel-track is used.
* Glendalough &quot;Spinc/White Trail&quot; (Wicklow). An 8–kilometre &quot;loop-route&quot; on the mountains surrounding the Upper Glendalough Lake, that takes in the rocky The Spinc outcrop and associated views into the valley below.
* Torc Mountain (Kerry). A boarded path to the summit that enables hill-walkers to complete the longer 8–kilometre Torc Waterfall to Torc Mountain summit route without requiring any special mountain footwear or navigation skills.

=== &quot;Teresa Wall vs NPWS&quot; (2016) ===
The future of boarded mountain paths and trails in Ireland was put in doubt when a climber, Teresa Wall, successfully sued the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in the Circuit Court for €40,000 in 2016 for an injury sustained on the Djouce boarded walk (she required seven stitches after tripping on the boardwalk and cutting her knee near the &quot;J.B. Malone memorial stone&quot;); however, her award was overturned in February 2017 following a High Court appeal by the NPWS, which rejected her arguments that a &quot;trip hazard&quot; is the same whatever the location.


==Interconnecting trails==
===National===
Beara-Breifne Way is a walking and cycling route under development intended to run from the Beara Peninsula, Cork to Breifne, Leitrim following the line of Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare&#x27;s march in the aftermath of the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. The intended route will make use of the Beara Way; Ballyhoura Way; Suck Valley Way; Miner&#x27;s Way and Historical Trail; Leitrim Way; and Cavan Way.

===International===
European walking route E8 is an international walking trail that extends from Dursey Island, County Cork to Istanbul in Turkey. In Ireland the E8 follows the Wicklow, South Leinster, East Munster and Blackwater Ways and parts of the Kerry and Beara Ways.

There is also a proposal to extend the International Appalachian Trail (IAT), an extension of the Appalachian Trail through Canada to Newfoundland, to all terrain that formed part of the Appalachian Mountains of Pangaea, including Ireland. It is proposed that the Irish leg of the IAT will make use of the Slí Colmcille and the Bluestack Way in County Donegal before joining the Ulster Way in Northern Ireland.

<doc id="243685" wikidata="Q80405" url="?curid=243685" title="Julianne Moore">
<text>Julie Anne Smith (born December 3, 1960), known professionally as Julianne Moore, is an American actress. Prolific in film since the early 1990s, she is known for her portrayals of emotionally troubled women in independent films, and for her roles in blockbusters. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Emmy Awards. In 2015, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and in 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named her one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

After studying theatre at Boston University, Moore acted in a string of acclaimed independent films such as &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), and &quot;Safe&quot; (1995), the later being the first of many collaborations with Todd Haynes. She later won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as an Alzheimer&#x27;s patient in &quot;Still Alice&quot; (2014). She was Oscar-nominated for playing a 1970s pornographic actress in the drama &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), and unhappy mid-20th century housewives in the romantic dramas &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1999), &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002). 

Moore has acted in numerous independent films such as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), &quot;A Single Man&quot; (2009), &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; (2010), &quot;Maps to the Stars&quot; (2014), &quot;May December&quot; (2023), and &quot;The Room Next Door&quot; (2024) as well as the Hollywood films &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995), &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), and &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot; (2011). Her highest-grossing releases came with the final two films in &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series (2014–2015) and the spy film &quot;&quot; (2017).

On television, Moore was a regular in the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1985–1988), earning a Daytime Emmy Award. She portrayed Sarah Palin in the HBO film &quot;Game Change&quot; (2012) earning a Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. She also played Nancy Donovan in the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2009–2013), and Mary Villiers in the historical miniseries &quot;Mary &amp; George&quot; (2024).

In addition to her acting work, Moore has written a series of children&#x27;s books about a character named &quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot;. She is married to director Bart Freundlich, with whom she has two children.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born Julie Anne Smith on December 3, 1960, at the Fort Bragg army installation in North Carolina. Her father, Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, attained the rank of colonel and became a military judge. Her mother, Anne (née Love 1940–2009), was a Scottish psychologist and social worker from Greenock, Scotland, who had migrated with her family to the United States in 1951. Moore has a younger sister, Valerie Smith, and a younger brother, the novelist Peter Moore Smith. Having a Scottish mother, Moore claimed British citizenship in 2011 in honor of her.

Because of her father&#x27;s occupation, Moore frequently moved around the United States as a child. She was close with her family as a result, but says she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. In spite of these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: &quot;When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was ... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change.&quot;

When Moore was 16, the family moved from Falls Church, Virginia, where Moore was attending J.E.B. Stuart High School, to Frankfurt, West Germany, where she attended Frankfurt American High School. She was clever and studious, a self-proclaimed &quot;good girl&quot;, and she planned to become a doctor. She had never considered performing, or even attended the theater, but she was an avid reader and it was this hobby that led her to begin acting at the school. Moore appeared in several plays, including &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot;, and with the encouragement of her English teacher, she chose to pursue a theatrical career. Her parents supported her decision, but asked that she train at university to provide the added security of a college degree. She was accepted into Boston University and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre.

==Career==
===Early work and breakthrough (1985–1993)===
Moore moved to New York City after graduating, and worked as a waitress. After registering her stage name with Actors&#x27; Equity, she began her career in 1985 with off-Broadway theatre. Her first screen role came in 1984, in an episode of the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. Her break came the following year, when she joined the cast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Playing the dual roles of half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina Hughes, she found this intensive work to be an important learning experience, and she said of it fondly: &quot;I gained confidence and learned to take responsibility.&quot; Moore performed on the show until 1988, when she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series. Before leaving &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, she had a role in the 1987 CBS miniseries &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot;. Once she finished her contract at &quot;World Turns&quot;, she played Ophelia in a Guthrie Theater production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; opposite Željko Ivanek. The actress returned intermittently to television over the next three years, appearing in the TV movies &quot;Money, Power, Murder&quot; (1989), &quot;The Last to Go&quot; (1991), and &quot;Cast a Deadly Spell&quot; (1991).

In 1990, Moore began working with stage director Andre Gregory on a workshop theatre production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Described by Moore as &quot;one of the most fundamentally important acting experiences I ever had&quot;, the group spent four years exploring the text and giving intimate performances to friends. Also in 1990, Moore made her cinematic debut as a mummy&#x27;s victim in &quot;Tales from the Darkside: The Movie&quot;, a low-budget horror that she later described as &quot;terrible&quot;. Her next film role, in 1992, introduced her to a wide audience. The thriller &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;in which she played the main character&#x27;s ill-fated friendwas number one at the US box office, and Moore caught the attention of several critics for her performance. She followed it the same year with the crime comedy &quot;The Gun in Betty Lou&#x27;s Handbag&quot;, appearing as the protagonist&#x27;s kooky sister. She continued to play supporting roles throughout 1993, first featuring in the erotic thriller &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; as Madonna&#x27;s love rival. The film was panned by reviewers and heavily mocked, and Moore subsequently regretted her involvement—terming it &quot;a big mistake&quot;. She had greater success in a 1993 romantic comedy with Johnny Depp. In &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot;, Moore played a gentle waitress who falls for Aidan Quinn&#x27;s character, Benny. She also appeared briefly as a doctor in one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits, the Harrison Ford-starring thriller &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

Filmmaker Robert Altman saw Moore in the &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; production, and was sufficiently impressed to cast her in his next project: the ensemble drama &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), based on short stories by Raymond Carver. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when she saw it in college. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a &quot;total unknown&quot; surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore&#x27;s breakthrough role. The critic Todd McCarthy called her performance &quot;arresting&quot; and remarked that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would &quot;no doubt be the most discussed scene&quot; of the film. &quot;Short Cuts&quot; was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globe Awards. Moore received an individual nomination for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety.

=== Rise to prominence (1994–1997) ===
&quot;Short Cuts&quot; was one of a trio of successive film appearances that raised Moore&#x27;s profile. It was followed in 1994 with &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot;, a filmed version of her ongoing &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore&#x27;s performance of Yelena was described as &quot;simply outstanding&quot; by &quot;Time Out&quot;, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes&#x27; low-budget film &quot;Safe&quot; (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she subsequently swore off changing her body for a film again. In their review, &quot;Empire&quot; writes that &quot;Safe&quot; &quot;first established [Moore&#x27;s] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation&quot;. The film historian David Thomson later described it as &quot;one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s&quot;, and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore remarked, &quot;They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing.&quot;

Moore&#x27;s next appearance was a supporting role in the comedy-drama &quot;Roommates&quot; (1995), playing the daughter-in-law of Peter Falk&#x27;s character. Her following film, &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995), was crucial in establishing her as a Hollywood leading lady. The romantic comedy, directed by Chris Columbus and co-starring Hugh Grant, was poorly reviewed, but a box office success; it remains one of her highest-grossing films. Her next release was also a Hollywood production, as Moore appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas in the thriller &quot;Assassins&quot; (1995). Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide. Moore&#x27;s sole appearance of 1996 came in the Merchant Ivory film &quot;Surviving Picasso&quot;, where she played the artist Dora Maar opposite Anthony Hopkins. The period drama met with poor reviews.

A key point in her career came when Steven Spielberg cast Moore as paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; – the sequel to his 1993 blockbuster &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself &quot;tremendously&quot;. It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, &quot;There was so much hanging everywhere. We hung off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things ... it was just non-stop.&quot; &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1997) finished as one of the ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: &quot;Suddenly I had a commercial film career&quot;, she said. &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;.

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Moore achieve significant industry recognition. Her first Academy Award nomination came for the critically acclaimed &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), which centers on a group of individuals working in the 1970s pornography industry. Director Paul Thomas Anderson was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Moore agreed to the film after being impressed with his &quot;exhilarating&quot; script. The ensemble piece featured Moore as Amber Waves, a leading porn actress and mother-figure who longs to be re-united with her real son. Martyn Glanville of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of confidence and vulnerability, and was impressed with Moore&#x27;s effort. &quot;Time Out&quot; called the performance &quot;superb&quot;, while Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it &quot;wonderful&quot;. Alongside her Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Moore was nominated at the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards, and several critics groups named her a winner.

=== Worldwide recognition (1998–2002) ===
Moore followed her success in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; with a role in the Coen brothers&#x27; dark comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998). The film was not a hit at the time of its release, but has since become a cult classic. Her role was Maude Lebowski, a feminist artist and daughter of the eponymous character who becomes involved with &quot;The Dude&quot; (Jeff Bridges, the film&#x27;s star). At the end of 1998, Moore had a flop with Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, a remake of the classic Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name. She played Lila Crane in the film, which received poor reviews and is described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of her &quot;pointless&quot; outings. A review in &quot;Boxoffice&quot; magazine bemoaned that &quot;a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives&quot; on the film.

After re-uniting with Robert Altman for the dark comedy &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1999), Moore starred in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; – Oliver Parker&#x27;s adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play. Set in London at the end of the nineteenth century, her performance of Mrs. Laura Cheverly earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. She was also nominated in the Drama category that year for her work in &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1999). Based on the novel by Graham Greene, Moore played opposite Ralph Fiennes as an adulterous wife in 1940s Britain. The critic Michael Sragow was full of praise for her work, writing that her performance was &quot;the critical element that makes [the film] necessary viewing&quot;. Moore received her second Academy Award nomination for the role – her first for Best Actress – as well as nominations at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards.

In between her two Golden Globe-nominated performances, Moore was seen in &quot;A Map of the World&quot;, supporting Sigourney Weaver, as a bereaved mother. Her fifth and final film of 1999 was the acclaimed drama &quot;Magnolia&quot;, a &quot;giant mosaic&quot; chronicling the lives of multiple characters over one day in Los Angeles. Paul Thomas Anderson, in his follow-up to &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, wrote a role specifically for Moore. His primary objective was to &quot;see her explode&quot;, and he cast her as a morphine-addicted wife. Moore has said it was a particularly difficult role, but she was rewarded with a SAG nomination. She was subsequently named Best Supporting Actress of 1999 by the National Board of Review, in recognition of her three performances in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, and &quot;A Map of the World&quot;.

Apart from a cameo role in the comedy &quot;The Ladies Man&quot;, Moore&#x27;s only other appearance in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Not I&quot;. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI agent Clarice Starling in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, a sequel to the Oscar-winning film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore said she was not interested in, nor capable of, upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, &quot;Hannibal&quot; earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction comedy &quot;Evolution&quot;, in her husband&#x27;s dramatic film &quot;World Traveler&quot;, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in &quot;The Shipping News&quot;. All three films were poorly received.

The year 2002 marked a high point in Moore&#x27;s career, as she became the ninth performer to be nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year. She received a Best Actress nomination for the melodrama &quot;Far from Heaven&quot;, in which she played a 1950s housewife whose world is shaken when her husband reveals he is gay. The role was written specifically for her by Todd Haynes, the first time the pair had worked together since &quot;Safe&quot;, and Moore described it as &quot;a very, very personal project ... such an incredible honor to do&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; praised her &quot;beautifully gauged performance&quot; of a desperate woman &quot;buckling under social pressures and putting on a brave face&quot;. Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters of what we call great acting that it nearly defies categorization&quot;. The role won Moore the Best Actress award from 19 different organizations, including the Venice Film Festival and the National Board of Review.

Moore&#x27;s second Oscar nomination that year came for &quot;The Hours&quot;, which she co-starred in with Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep. She again played a troubled 1950s housewife, prompting Kenneth Turan to write that she was &quot;essentially reprising her &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; role&quot;. Moore said it was an &quot;unfortunate coincidence&quot; that the similar roles came at the same time, and that the characters had differing personalities. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the performance &quot;wrenching&quot;, while Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised a &quot;superbly controlled, humane performance&quot;. &quot;The Hours&quot; was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Moore also received BAFTA and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and was jointly awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress with Kidman and Streep at the Berlin International Film Festival.

=== Established actress (2003–2009) ===
Moore did not make any screen appearances in 2003, but returned in 2004, with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot;, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, did not get a cinematic release; &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot; followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with &quot;The Forgotten&quot;, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.

In 2005, Moore worked with her husband for the third time in the comedy &quot;Trust the Man&quot;, and starred in the true story of 1950s housewife Evelyn Ryan in &quot;The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio&quot;. Her first release of 2006 was &quot;Freedomland&quot;, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The response was overwhelmingly negative, but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade.

Moore made her Broadway debut in the world premiere of David Hare&#x27;s play &quot;The Vertical Hour&quot;. The production, directed by Sam Mendes and co-starring Bill Nighy, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq challenged. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the &quot;tough, assertive&quot; quality that her role required. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized her &quot;lack of stage technique&quot;, adding that she appeared &quot;stiffly self-conscious&quot;. Moore later admitted she found it difficult performing on Broadway and had not connected with the medium, but was glad to have experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances.

Moore played an FBI agent for the second time in &quot;Next&quot; (2007), a science fiction action film co-starring Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the response from critics was highly negative. Manohla Dargis wrote, &quot;Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to be here, and it&#x27;s no wonder.&quot; The actress has since described it as her worst film. &quot;Next&quot; was followed by &quot;Savage Grace&quot; (2007), the true story of Barbara Daly Baekeland – a high-society mother whose Oedipal relationship with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. &quot;Savage Grace&quot; had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a &quot;coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film explored the life of Bob Dylan, with Moore playing a character based on Joan Baez. In 2008, she starred with Mark Ruffalo in &quot;Blindness&quot;, a dystopian thriller from the director Fernando Meirelles. The film was not widely seen, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new releases. She had a supporting role in &quot;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee&quot;, and then starred in the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot; with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the well-received drama &quot;A Single Man&quot;. Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film starred Colin Firth as a homosexual professor who wishes to end his life. Moore played his best friend, &quot;a fellow English expat and semi-alcoholic divorcee&quot;, a character that Tom Ford, the film&#x27;s writer-director, created with her in mind. Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; commented that it was Moore&#x27;s best role in &quot;some time&quot;, and was impressed by the &quot;extraordinary emotional nuance&quot; of her performance. &quot;A Single Man&quot; was selected as one of the top 10 films of 2009 by the American Film Institute, and Moore received a fifth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.

=== Return to television and comedic films (2010–2013) ===
Moore returned to television for the first time in 18 years when she played a guest role in the fourth season of &quot;30 Rock&quot;. She appeared in five episodes of the Emmy-winning comedy, playing Nancy Donovan, a love interest to Alec Baldwin&#x27;s character Jack Donaghy. She later appeared in the series finale in January 2013. She also returned to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Frannie Hughes, making a brief cameo appearance in a scene with her character&#x27;s family near the end of the show&#x27;s run in 2010.

Her first big-screen appearance of the new decade was &quot;Shelter&quot; (2010), a film described as &quot;heinous&quot; by Tim Robey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The psychological thriller received negative reviews and did not have a U.S. release until 2013 (retitled &quot;6 Souls&quot;). Moore next starred with Annette Bening in the independent film &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; (2010), a comedy-drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer-director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film&#x27;s sexual content. The actress was drawn to the film&#x27;s &quot;universal&quot; depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore&#x27;s performance of Jules, who she called an &quot;existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty&quot;, writing, &quot;There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera – sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally ... and Moore plays every note perfectly.&quot; &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.

For her next project, Moore actively looked for another comedy. She had a supporting role in &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film &quot;Game Change&quot;, a dramatization of Sarah Palin&#x27;s 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although the response to the film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore&#x27;s performance. For the first time in her career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award.

Moore made two film appearances in 2012. The drama &quot;Being Flynn&quot;, in which she supported Robert De Niro, had a limited release. Greater success came for &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot;, the story of a young girl caught in the middle of her parents&#x27; divorce. Adapted from Henry James&#x27;s novel and updated to the 21st century, the drama earned near-universal critical praise. The role of Susanna, Maisie&#x27;s rock-star mother, required Moore to sing on camera, which was a challenge she embraced despite finding it embarrassing. She called Susanna a terrible parent, but said the role did not make her uncomfortable, as she fully compartmentalized the character: &quot;I know that that&#x27;s not me&quot;.

Following her well-received performance in &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot;, Moore began 2013 with a supporting role in Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s comedy &quot;Don Jon&quot;, playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that Moore was a key factor in its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy &quot;The English Teacher&quot; (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother Margaret White in &quot;Carrie&quot;, an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s horror novel. Coming 37 years after Brian De Palma&#x27;s well-known take on the book, Moore stated that she wanted to make the role her own. By drawing on King&#x27;s writing rather than the 1976 film, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that she managed to &quot;[suggest] a history – one never told, just hinted at – of serious damage in [Margaret&#x27;s] past&quot;. Although the film was a box office success, it was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation.

=== Critical and commercial success (2014–2017) ===
At age 53, Moore enjoyed a considerable degree of critical and commercial success in 2014. Her first release of the year came alongside Liam Neeson in the action-thriller &quot;Non-Stop&quot;, set aboard an airplane. The response to the film was mixed, but it earned $223 million worldwide. She followed this by winning the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance as Havana Segrand, an aging actress receiving psychotherapy in David Cronenberg&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Maps to the Stars&quot;. Described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;grotesque, gaudy, and ruthless&quot; character, Moore based her role on &quot;an amalgam of Hollywood casualties she ha[d] encountered&quot;, and drew upon her early experiences in the industry. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; was critical of the film, but found Moore to be &quot;incredible&quot; and &quot;fearless&quot; in it. Moore&#x27;s success at Cannes made her the second actress in history, after Juliette Binoche, to win Best Actress awards at the &quot;Big Three&quot; film festivals (Berlin, Cannes, and Venice). She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.

Moore played the supporting role of President Alma Coin, the leader of a rebellion against The Capitol, in the third installment of the lucrative &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series, &quot;Mockingjay – Part 1&quot;. The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final film performance of 2014 ranks among the most acclaimed of her career. In the drama &quot;Still Alice&quot;, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was &quot;extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence&quot;, while according to Kenneth Turan, she was &quot;especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out&quot;. Several critics felt it was her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA, and Academy Award for Best Actress.

Moore began 2015 by appearing as an evil queen in &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, a poorly received fantasy-adventure film co-starring Jeff Bridges. She also appeared opposite Elliot Page in &quot;Freeheld&quot;, a drama based on a true story about a detective and her same-sex partner, and in the romantic comedy &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Plan&quot;, with Greta Gerwig and Ethan Hawke. Both films were presented at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. In &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Plan&quot;, Moore played a pretentious Danish professor, a comedic role which critic Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; deemed as the film&#x27;s &quot;chief pleasure&quot;. Later that year, she reprised her role as Alma Coin in &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2&quot;, the final film of the series.

After a one-year absence from the screen, Moore had three film releases in 2017. She appeared in a dual role in &quot;Wonderstruck&quot;, a film adaptation of Brian Selznick&#x27;s historical children&#x27;s novel of the same name, which reteamed her with Todd Haynes. Her parts were of a silent movie star in the 1920s and a deaf librarian in the 1970s; in preparation, she studied sign language and watched the films of Lillian Gish. Richard Lawson considered her to be &quot;eminently watchable&quot; despite her limited screen time. Moore portrayed a dual role for the second time that year in &quot;Suburbicon&quot;, a satirical thriller written by the Coen brothers and directed by George Clooney. She was cast opposite Matt Damon as twin sisters in 1950s America, named Rose and Margaret, who become embroiled in a local crime. The film received negative reviews, with critics saying it failed to effectively portray American racism, but Geoffrey Macnab of &quot;The Independent&quot; praised Moore for giving &quot;a perfectly judged comic performance as a Barbara Stanwyck-like femme fatale&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s final release of the year was the sequel to the 2015 spy film &quot;&quot;, subtitled &quot;&quot;, co-starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Channing Tatum, and Halle Berry. She played the part of the villainous entrepreneur Poppy Adams, who runs a drug cartel. Despite her character&#x27;s actions, Moore played the part to make Poppy seem &quot;strange, but reasonable&quot;. Peter Debruge described the film as &quot;outlandish&quot;, and wrote that Moore had played her part &quot;as Martha Stewart crossed with a demonic 1950s housewife&quot;. The film earned over $410 million worldwide.

=== Independent films and streaming projects (2018–present) ===
Moore had two films that premiered in 2018. She was drawn to Sebastián Lelio&#x27;s &quot;Gloria Bell&quot;, an English-language remake of Lelio&#x27;s own Chilean film &quot;Gloria&quot;, for its rare depiction of a middle-age woman&#x27;s quest for meaning in life. Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; believed she had delivered &quot;an utterly natural and quietly spellbinding star performance,&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; named her one of &quot;the 10 best actors of the year.&quot; Her second film that year was &quot;Bel Canto&quot;, a thriller based on Ann Patchett&#x27;s novel of the same name about the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. For her performance as an opera singer, she learned to mimic the body language of professionals for scenes in which Renée Fleming performed the vocals. Guy Lodge of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; deemed the film an unsuccessful adaptation of the novel and considered Moore&#x27;s work to be &quot;edgeless fare by her standards&quot;. The following year, she teamed with her husband once again in &quot;After the Wedding&quot;, a remake of Susanne Bier&#x27;s Danish film of the same name. It featured her and Michelle Williams in roles played by men in the original film. That same year, she starred in &quot;The Staggering Girl&quot;, a short film directed by Luca Guadagnino.

In 2020, Moore portrayed the feminist activist Gloria Steinem in the biopic &quot;The Glorias&quot;, sharing the part with actresses Alicia Vikander and Lulu Wilson. In following year, she had supporting roles opposite Amy Adams in Joe Wright&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, based on the novel of the same name, and in Stephen Chbosky&#x27;s musical film &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, based on the stage musical of the same name. Both films were poorly received. Moore played the title role in &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story&quot;, an Apple TV+ miniseries adapted from Stephen King&#x27;s thriller novel of the same name. The miniseries was not well received, despite praise for Moore&#x27;s work. She took on the leading role of an uptight mother in &quot;When You Finish Saving the World&quot; (2022), a comedy-drama film by Jesse Eisenberg. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s John DeFore commended her for empathetically portraying an unlikable character. Moore served as jury president of the 79th Venice International Film Festival in 2022.

Moore next starred in the thriller film &quot;Sharper&quot; (2023) for Apple TV+, which she also produced; it had modest reviews. Once again, she collaborated with Todd Haynes in &quot;May December&quot;, a drama co-starring Natalie Portman, in which she played a woman married to a much-younger man. Moore was pleased to play a transgressive character, finding her &quot;unbelievably complicated and compelling&quot;. The film received considerable critical acclaim, and Jonathan Romney of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; commended Moore for combining both &quot;neurotic fragility and over-bearing brittleness&quot; in her performance. She received another Golden Globe nomination for it.

The 2024 historical satire miniseries &quot;Mary &amp; George&quot; starred Moore as Mary Villiers opposite Nicholas Galitzine&#x27;s George Villiers. &quot;The Independent&quot; Nick Hilton found Moore &quot;more effective in Mary&#x27;s dramatic moments than her farcical ones,&quot; while Lucy Mangan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called her performance &quot;brilliant – cold, clever and always scintillating.&quot; It earned her another Independent Spirit Award nomination. The same year, Moore starred alongside Tilda Swinton in &quot;The Room Next Door&quot;, which marked Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s first English-language feature film and won the Golden Lion at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. Based on the novel &quot;What Are You Going Through&quot; by Sigrid Nunez, Moore played an author who reunites with a former colleague with cancer. She was particularly drawn towards the project for its depiction of female friendship, which she believed was rare in film. Complementing the performances of both women, BBC Culture&#x27;s Nicholas Barber found Moore &quot;especially deft&quot; in her delivery of Almodóvar&#x27;s awkwardly written dialogues. She received a Goya Award nomination as Best Actress for it. 

In her third project for Apple TV+, Moore will next lead the thriller film &quot;Echo Valley&quot;. She will also team with James McAvoy in the action thriller film &quot;Control&quot;.

==Writing==
Alongside her acting work, Moore has established a career as a children&#x27;s author. Her first book, &quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot;, was published in October 2007 and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. Described by &quot;Time Out&quot; as a &quot;simple, sweet and semi-autobiographical narrative&quot;, it tells the story of a girl who wishes to be rid of her freckles, but eventually accepts them. Moore decided to write the book when her young son began disliking aspects of his appearance; she was reminded of her own childhood, when she was teased for having freckles and called &quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot; by other children.

The book has turned into a series with six follow-ups : &quot;Freckleface Strawberry and the Dodgeball Bully&quot; was published in 2009, and &quot;Freckleface Strawberry: Best Friends Forever&quot; in 2011. Both carry the message that children can overcome their own problems. &quot;Freckleface Strawberry: Backpacks!&quot;, &quot;Freckleface Strawberry: Lunch, or What&#x27;s That?&quot; and &quot;Freckleface Strawberry: Loose Tooth!&quot; were released as part of Random House publisher&#x27;s &quot;Step Into Reading&quot; program. These were followed by &quot;Freckleface Strawberry and the Really Big Voice&quot; in summer 2016.

&quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot; has been adapted into a musical, written by Rose Caiola and Gary Kupper, which premiered at the New World Stages, New York, in October 2010. Moore had an input in the production, particularly through requesting that it retain the book&#x27;s young target audience. The show has since been licensed and performed at several venues, which she calls &quot;extremely gratifying and extremely flattering&quot;.

Moore has written one children&#x27;s book separate from the &quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot; series. Released in 2013, &quot;My Mom is a Foreigner, But Not to Me&quot; is based on her experiences of growing up with a mother from another country. The book had a negative reception from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;; while recognizing it as well-intentioned, Moore&#x27;s use of verse and rhyme was criticized.

In February 2025, under the second Trump administration, an executive order required about 160 Defense Department-run schools to conduct a compliance review of books regarding “gender ideology” and “racial indoctrination”. After Moore said that her &quot;Freckleface Strawberry&quot; book was banned by the Pentagon, some media headlines implied a wholesale nationwide ban of the book&quot;.&quot;

==Artistry and reception==
Moore has been described by the media as one of the most talented and accomplished actresses of her generation. As a woman in her sixties, she is unusual in being an older actress who continues to work regularly and in prominent roles. She enjoys the variety of starring in both low-budget independent films and large-scale Hollywood productions. In 2004, an &quot;IGN&quot; journalist wrote of this &quot;rare ability to bounce between commercially viable projects like &quot;Nine Months&quot; to art house masterpieces like &quot;Safe&quot; unscathed&quot;, adding, &quot;She is respected in art houses and multiplexes alike.&quot; She is noted for playing in a range of material, and Ridley Scott, who directed Moore in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, has praised her versatility. In October 2013, Moore received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has been included in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual beauty lists on four occasions (1995, 2003, 2008, 2013). In 2015, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Moore one of the 100 most influential people in the world on the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her eleventh on its list of the greatest actors of the 21st century, and in a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, she was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time.

Moore is particularly known for playing troubled women, and specializes in &quot;ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions&quot;. Oliver Burkeman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes that her characters are typically &quot;struggling to maintain a purchase on normality in the face of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure&quot;. Suzie Mackenzie, also of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has identified a theme of &quot;characters in a state of alienation ... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question.&quot; Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a &quot;trademark moment&quot; in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the &quot;queen of the big-screen breakdown&quot;. &quot;When she does finally crack&quot;, writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, &quot;it&#x27;s a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore.&quot; Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has praised Moore&#x27;s ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is &quot;peerless&quot; in her &quot;portraits of troubled womanhood&quot;. When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is &quot;a bit of a bore&quot;. &quot;Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore&#x27;s specialty&quot;, he says, &quot;and it&#x27;s here that you sense the magic she is capable of.&quot;

An interest in portraying &quot;actual human drama&quot; has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly moved by the concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because &quot;we&#x27;re just not very often in that position in our lives&quot;. Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to be praised for her &quot;fearless&quot; performances and for taking on difficult roles. When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, &quot;Nothing within the realm of human behavior.&quot; She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes, although she has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role.

Regarding her approach to acting, Moore said in a 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: &quot;I want to have a sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera.&quot; The aim, she said, is to &quot;try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [happen] to you, that you don&#x27;t bring the emotion to it ... and when it happens, there&#x27;s nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding.&quot;

==Personal life==
Actor and stage director John Gould Rubin was Moore&#x27;s first husband, whom she met in 1984 and married two years later. They separated in 1993, and their divorce was finalized in August 1995. &quot;I got married too early and I really didn&#x27;t want to be there&quot;, she has since said. Moore began a relationship with Bart Freundlich, her director on &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot;, in 1996. They married on August 23, 2003, and reside in Greenwich Village, New York City. Moore has two children with Freundlich: a son who was born in 1997, and a daughter who was born in 2002. Moore has commented, &quot;We have a very solid family life, and it is the most satisfying thing I have ever done.&quot; While raising young children, Moore spoke about how it affected her career choices, saying she selected roles that were practical for her as a parent and did not require her to be away for extended periods of time.

Moore was featured in the PBS program &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;. Researchers mapped out Moore&#x27;s family tree and analyzed her DNA. When Moore&#x27;s friend, actor Marisa Tomei did the same, Tomei and Moore learned they are genetic cousins. Moore is an atheist; when asked on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; what God might say to her upon arrival in heaven, she gave God&#x27;s response as, &quot;Well, I guess you were wrong, I do exist.&quot; Moore is politically liberal and endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. She is a pro-choice activist and sits on the board of advocates for Planned Parenthood. She is also a campaigner for gay rights and gun control and, since 2008, she has been an Artist Ambassador for Save the Children. She works with Everytown for Gun Safety. Moore opposed Donald Trump&#x27;s immigration policies. In 2020, she supported Joe Biden for president. Moore is a supporter of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students in Parkland, Florida, who organized the March For Our Lives. She also helped release a music video for the group.

Moore has said she finds little value in the concept of celebrity, and is concerned with living a &quot;normal&quot; life. Upon meeting her, the journalist Suzie Mackenzie described Moore as &quot;the most unostentatious of stars&quot;, and she attracts little gossip or tabloid attention. She is humble about her profession (&quot;it&#x27;s just a person with a job&quot;) and casual in her appearance. Moore is known for maintaining a natural image and refraining from botox and plastic surgery. &quot;I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make people look any younger. It makes them look like they&#x27;ve had surgery&quot;, she said in 2009; &quot;It&#x27;s an aesthetic that&#x27;s not human.&quot;

<text>Ubol Ratana Rajakanya (, , ; born 5 April 1951) is a member of the Thai royal family. She is the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit, and the elder sister of King Vajiralongkorn.

In 1972, she married American citizen Peter Ladd Jensen and settled in the United States, after giving up her royal title. The couple divorced in 1998, whereupon she resumed her royal duties and position within the Thai court. She is styled in English as &quot;Princess Ubol Ratana&quot;, without the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;.

In 2001, she permanently returned to Thailand after a series of visits in the years following her divorce. Almost immediately, she began to fulfill her royal duties by taking part in many ceremonies. She started many charitable foundations that focused on improving the quality of life for the disadvantaged.

In February 2019, in an &quot;unprecedented&quot; move, Ubol Ratana announced her candidacy for Prime Minister of Thailand in the 2019 general election, running as a candidate of the Thai Raksa Chart Party. Later that same day, her younger brother King Vajiralongkorn issued a statement, stating that her candidacy is &quot;inappropriate&quot; and &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. Thailand&#x27;s election commission then disqualified her from running for prime minister, formally putting an end to her candidacy.

==Early life==
Princess Ubol Ratana Rajakanya is the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. She was born on 5 April 1951, at Clinique de Montchoisi in Lausanne, Switzerland. She is the only child born outside of Thailand from the four children of former King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit.

&quot;Ubol Ratana&quot;, part of her royal name, means &quot;glass lotus&quot;, a reference to her maternal grandmother, Bua (&quot;lotus&quot;) Kitiyakara. Her parents nicknamed her &quot;Pay&quot;, short for &quot;Poupée&quot; (French for &quot;doll&quot;). To her family she is known as &quot;Phi Ying&quot;. In the media and by Thai people in general, she is called &quot;Thun Kramom&quot;, a title identifying the daughter of a reigning queen.

She returned to Thailand and stayed at Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, Dusit Palace. She was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; by her father at the royal celebration of the first month birthday ceremony (Phra Ratchaphithi Somphot Duean Lae Khuen Phra U; พระราชพิธีสมโภชเดือนและขึ้นพระอู่) King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave her full name and title &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Ubol Ratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi&quot;.

Ubol Ratana was Bhumibol&#x27;s favorite child because she was attractive and excelled at academics and sports, where her brother, Vajiralongkorn did not. The king greatly enjoyed playing tennis and badminton with her. This was partly due to his suspicion that others were not trying their hardest when playing sports with him and he admired Ubol Ratana for always trying her best.

In the 1967 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games (today called the &quot;Southeast Asian Games&quot;) held in Bangkok, the king and the princess competed in the OK Dinghy sailing class and won gold medals for Thailand.

Their participation was conceived by Air Chief Marshal Dawee Chullasapya who wanted Bhumibol to be seen excelling in sports, much like a Norwegian king who won a gold Olympics medal. During the race, Ubol Ratana was ahead and the king was trailing behind. Davee feared that this would tarnish the king&#x27;s prestige, but ultimately the king won the race and the father and daughter shared the medal.

==Education==
Ubol Ratana attended primary to secondary levels at Chitralada School. She went to the United States for her tertiary education. She studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1973. She later obtained a master&#x27;s degree in public health at University of California, Los Angeles.

==Marriage and family==
While studying at university, Ubol Ratana dated an American, Peter Ladd Jensen. The palace discovered this, and her parents strongly opposed their relationship. The princess refused to conform to their wishes; on 25 July 1972, she married Jensen.

According to Paul M. Handley&#x27;s biography of Bhumibol, the king became furious at Ubol Ratana and stripped her of her royal title. Ubol Ratana made many attempts to ask her father to reinstate her royal title before and after her permanent return to Thailand, but the king never relented.

The princess lived in the United States with her husband for over 26 years and took the name &quot;Mrs. Julie Jensen&quot;. After years of rumoured marital problems, they divorced in 1998. Ubol Ratana and her children continued to reside in San Diego until 2001, when they returned to Thailand.

The couple had three children, two daughters and a son, all born in the United States:

* Than Phu Ying Ploypailin Mahidol Jensen (born 12 February 1981) married David Wheeler on 25 August 2009, and has three children.
* Khun Bhumi Jensen (affectionately known as Khun Poom) (16 August 1983 – 26 December 2004), who had autism, died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Princess Ubol Ratana established the Khun Poom Foundation in his memory, to aid children with autism and other learning disabilities.
*Than Phu Ying Sirikitiya Mai Jensen (born 18 March 1985) holds a degree in history.

While Ubol Ratana remained in the US, her mother (Queen Sirikit) and other members of the royal family often flew there for visits. Ubol Ratana likewise flew to Thailand along with her husband to visit her parents and the other members of the royal family, while joining them in royal ceremonies when she visited Thailand. She visited in 1980, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1996, taking part in several family events, before her permanent return in 2001.

==Charitable work==
Ubol Ratana launched the &quot;To Be Number One&quot; Foundation in 2002 to combat drug use by young people. the foundation has more than 31 million members throughout Thailand. She hosts the television show, &quot;Talk to the Princess&quot; on TVT11 NBT where she promotes the aims of her anti-drug work.

==LGBTQ support==
In 2021, Ubol Ratana revealed that she is a fujoshi through her Princess Vlog on the YouTube channel of &quot;To Be Number One&quot; Foundation. She said she had grown up around gays and she supported LGBTQ. She is a big fan of many BL couples and series such as Bright-Win from 2gether: The Series, Kao-Up from Lovely Writer: The Series, Pond-Phuwin from Fish upon the Sky, etc.

In 2024, one of the judges in the qualifying round for the representative of Phitsanulok Province in &quot;To be Number One Idol&quot; contest criticized the LGBTQ youth contestant with inappropriate words, causing widespread criticism. Later, Ubol Ratana commented on Instagram that she never discriminated against LGBTQ and she supported them.

==Film career==
In 2003, Ubol Ratana starred in a Thai soap opera, &quot;Kasattiya&quot;. In 2006 she had a role in &quot;Anantalai&quot;, a drama series she wrote under the pen name &quot;Ploykampetch&quot;. In 2011, the princess and her daughter Ploypailin Jensen starred in &quot;Dao Long Fah, Pupha Si-ngen&quot;.

Ubol Ratana acted in the Thai movie &quot;Where The Miracle Happens&quot; (&quot;Neung Jai Diaokan&quot;) &quot;(หนึ่งใจ..เดียวกัน)&quot;, released on 7 August 2008 (in this film she also participated as a screenwriter). She plays a &quot;lonely-at-the-top&quot; CEO who begins a life of philanthropy after the death of her only daughter.
In 2010, she appeared in the action film &quot;My Best Bodyguard&quot; &quot;(มายเบสท์บอดี้การ์ด)&quot;, released on 21 October 2010. In 2012, she appeared in the romantic film &quot;Together&quot; (&quot;Wan Tee Rak&quot;) &quot;(ร่วมกัน)&quot;, released on 20 December 2012.

==Attempted candidacy for Prime Minister==
In 2019, it was announced Ubol Ratana would run as the prime ministerial candidate for the Thaksin-affiliated Thai Raksa Chart Party in the 2019 general election, called an &quot;astonishing&quot; move without precedent, as the royal family has never been directly involved in electoral politics. Her candidacy was quickly quashed by her brother, King Rama X, on the grounds that members of the royal family may not overtly participate in politics. After his statement, the Thai Raksa Chart Party withdrew their support for her run. The Election Commission, citing the king&#x27;s statement, disqualified her, while the Thai Raksa Chart Party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on the request of the Electoral Commission for attempting to bring a member of the royal family into politics; its leaders were banned from active politics for a decade.

<doc id="243689" wikidata="Q6591467" url="?curid=243689" title="List of National League pennant winners">
<text>The National League pennant winner of a given Major League Baseball season is the team that wins the championship—the pennant—of MLB&#x27;s National League (NL). This team receives the Warren C. Giles Trophy and the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the American League (AL). The current NL pennant winners are the Los Angeles Dodgers, who beat out the New York Mets to win the NL pennant in October 2024.

The trophy is named for Warren Giles, the league president from 1951 to 1969, and is presented immediately after each NL Championship Series (NLCS) by Warren&#x27;s son Bill Giles, the honorary league president and former owner of the Philadelphia Phillies.

From 1876 through 1968, the pennant was awarded to the team with the best regular-season record. Beginning in 1969, the league was divided into East and West divisions, with the champions of each playing for the pennant in the League Championship Series (NLCS). Since 1995, there have been three divisions and a two-round playoff bracket which begins with two Division Series (NLDS).

The pennant has been awarded every year since 1876, except for 1994, when a players&#x27; strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. Until 1969, the pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record at the end of the season. In 1969, the league split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the NLCS to determine the pennant winner. The format of the NLCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when MLB restructured the two divisions in each league into three. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as one wild card team, play in the NL Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play for the pennant.

By pennants, the Los Angeles Dodgers (formerly the Brooklyn Dodgers; 25 pennants, 32 playoff appearances) are the winningest team in NL history. The San Francisco Giants (formerly the New York Giants; 23 pennants, 27 playoff appearances) are in second place, with the St. Louis Cardinals (19 pennants and 28 playoff appearances), in third place, followed by the Atlanta Braves (18 pennants and 23 postseason appearances between their three home cities of Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Boston) in fourth place and the Chicago Cubs (17 pennants and 20 playoff appearances as the Cubs and White Stockings) in fifth. The Philadelphia Phillies were NL champions in back-to-back seasons in 2008 and 2009, becoming the first NL team to do so since the Braves in 1995 and 1996. The Dodgers were also league champions in back-to-back seasons in 2017 and 2018. The modern World Series began in 1903, when the National League recognized the upstart American League, founded in 1901. There was an earlier &quot;World&#x27;s Championship Series&quot; played between the pennant winners of the NL and the American Association 1884–1890; from 1894 to 1897 the NL&#x27;s first- and second-place teams played a postseason series for the Temple Cup, which was considered to be the league championship. As of 2021, the Dodgers have the most modern-era World Series appearances at 21, followed by the San Francisco Giants with 20.

The team with the best record to win the NL pennant was the 1906 Cubs, who won 116 of 152 games during that season and finished 20 games ahead of the New York Giants. The best record by a pennant winner in the Championship Series era is 108–54, which was achieved by the Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and the New York Mets in 1986; both of these teams went on to win the World Series.

NL champions have gone on to win the World Series 51 times, most recently in 2021. Pennant winners have also won the Temple Cup and the &quot;Chronicle-Telegraph&quot; Cup, two pre-World Series league championships, although second-place teams won three of the four Temple Cup meetings. The largest margin of victory for a pennant winner, before the league split into two divisions in 1969, is games; the Pittsburgh Pirates led the Brooklyn Superbas (now the Dodgers) by that margin on the final day of the 1902 season.

The only currently existing National League franchise to have never won an NL pennant are the Milwaukee Brewers; however, they did win a pennant during their time in the American League.

===Notes===
* A mid-season labor stoppage split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half in each division in the 1981 National League Division Series. The winners played in the 1981 NLCS for the National League pennant.
* The leagues were re-aligned in 1994 to three divisions and a wild card was added to the playoffs, but the labor stoppage cancelled the postseason. Wild cards were first used in the 1995 playoffs.

<text>Axel Hugo Theodor Theorell (6 July 1903 – 15 August 1982) was a Swedish scientist and Nobel Prize laureate in medicine.

He was born in Linköping as the son of Thure Theorell and his wife Armida Bill. Theorell went to Secondary School at Katedralskolan in Linköping and passed his examination there on 23 May 1921. In September, he began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute and in 1924 he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine. He then spent three months studying bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris under Professor Albert Calmette. In 1930 he obtained his M.D. degree with a theory on the lipids of the blood plasma, and was appointed professor in physiological chemistry at the Karolinska Institute.

Theorell, who dedicated his entire career to enzyme research, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1955 for discovering oxidoreductase enzymes and their effects. His contribution also consisted of the theory of the toxic effects of sodium fluoride on the cofactors of crucial human enzymes. In 1936 he was appointed Head of the newly established Biochemical Department of the Nobel Medical Institute, the first researcher related to the Institute to be awarded a Nobel Prize. His work had led to pioneering progress on alcohol dehydrogenases, enzymes that break down alcohol in the liver and other tissues. He received honorary degrees at universities in France, Belgium, Brazil and the United States. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the United States National Academy of Sciences, and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. 

Theorell died in Stockholm and is interred in Norra begravningsplatsen (The Northern Cemetery) alongside his wife, Elin Margit Elisabeth (née Alenius) Theorell, a distinguished pianist and harpsichordist who died in 2002.

<doc id="243709" wikidata="Q16667694" url="?curid=243709" title="Cubic function">
<text>In mathematics, a cubic function is a function of the form formula_1 that is, a polynomial function of degree three. In many texts, the &quot;coefficients&quot; , , , and are supposed to be real numbers, and the function is considered as a real function that maps real numbers to real numbers or as a complex function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers. In other cases, the coefficients may be complex numbers, and the function is a complex function that has the set of the complex numbers as its codomain, even when the domain is restricted to the real numbers.

Setting produces a cubic equation of the form
:formula_2
whose solutions are called roots of the function. The derivative of a cubic function is a quadratic function.

A cubic function with real coefficients has either one or three real roots (which may not be distinct); all odd-degree polynomials with real coefficients have at least one real root.

The graph of a cubic function always has a single inflection point. It may have two critical points, a local minimum and a local maximum. Otherwise, a cubic function is monotonic. The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point; that is, it is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around this point. Up to an affine transformation, there are only three possible graphs for cubic functions.

Cubic functions are fundamental for cubic interpolation.

==History==
==Critical and inflection points==

The critical points of a cubic function are its stationary points, that is the points where the slope of the function is zero. Thus the critical points of a cubic function defined by 
occur at values of such that the derivative
:formula_3
of the cubic function is zero.

The solutions of this equation are the -values of the critical points and are given, using the quadratic formula, by 
:formula_4

The sign of the expression inside the square root determines the number of critical points. If it is positive, then there are two critical points, one is a local maximum, and the other is a local minimum. If , then there is only one critical point, which is an inflection point. If , then there are no (real) critical points. In the two latter cases, that is, if is nonpositive, the cubic function is strictly monotonic. See the figure for an example of the case .

The inflection point of a function is where that function changes concavity. An inflection point occurs when the second derivative formula_5 is zero, and the third derivative is nonzero. Thus a cubic function has always a single inflection point, which occurs at
:formula_6

==Classification==
The graph of a cubic function is a cubic curve, though many cubic curves are not graphs of functions.

Although cubic functions depend on four parameters, their graph can have only very few shapes. In fact, the graph of a cubic function is always similar to the graph of a function of the form
:formula_7 
This similarity can be built as the composition of translations parallel to the coordinates axes, a homothecy (uniform scaling), and, possibly, a reflection (mirror image) with respect to the -axis. A further non-uniform scaling can transform the graph into the graph of one among the three cubic functions
:formula_8

This means that there are only three graphs of cubic functions up to an affine transformation.

The above geometric transformations can be built in the following way, when starting from a general cubic function 
formula_9

Firstly, if , the change of variable allows supposing . After this change of variable, the new graph is the mirror image of the previous one, with respect of the -axis.

Then, the change of variable provides a function of the form
:formula_10
This corresponds to a translation parallel to the -axis.

The change of variable corresponds to a translation with respect to the -axis, and gives a function of the form
:formula_11

The change of variable formula_12 corresponds to a uniform scaling, and give, after multiplication by formula_13 a function of the form 
:formula_14
which is the simplest form that can be obtained by a similarity.

Then, if , the non-uniform scaling formula_15 gives, after division by formula_16
:formula_17
where formula_18 has the value 1 or –1, depending on the sign of . If one defines formula_19 the latter form of the function applies to all cases (with formula_20 and formula_21).

==Symmetry==
For a cubic function of the form formula_22 the inflection point is thus the origin. As such a function is an odd function, its graph is symmetric with respect to the inflection point, and invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point. As these properties are invariant by similarity, the following is true for all cubic functions.

&quot;The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point, and is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point.&quot;

==Collinearities==
The tangent lines to the graph of a cubic function at three collinear points intercept the cubic again at collinear points. This can be seen as follows.

As this property is invariant under a rigid motion, one may suppose that the function has the form 
:formula_23

If is a real number, then the tangent to the graph of at the point is the line
So, the intersection point between this line and the graph of can be obtained solving the equation , that is
:formula_24
which can be rewritten
:formula_25
and factorized as
:formula_26
So, the tangent intercepts the cubic at
:formula_27

So, the function that maps a point of the graph to the other point where the tangent intercepts the graph is 
:formula_28
This is an affine transformation that transforms collinear points into collinear points. This proves the claimed result.

==Cubic interpolation==

Given the values of a function and its derivative at two points, there is exactly one cubic function that has the same four values, which is called a cubic Hermite spline.

There are two standard ways for using this fact. Firstly, if one knows, for example by physical measurement, the values of a function and its derivative at some sampling points, one can &quot;interpolate&quot; the function with a continuously differentiable function, which is a piecewise cubic function.

If the value of a function is known at several points, cubic interpolation consists in approximating the function by a continuously differentiable function, which is piecewise cubic. For having a uniquely defined interpolation, two more constraints must be added, such as the values of the derivatives at the endpoints, or a zero curvature at the endpoints.

<doc id="243718" wikidata="Q235783" url="?curid=243718" title="Flashlight">
<text>A flashlight (US English) or electric torch (Commonwealth English), usually shortened to torch, is a portable hand-held electric lamp. Formerly, the light source typically was a miniature incandescent light bulb, but these have been displaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) since the early 2000s. A typical flashlight consists of the light source mounted in a reflector, a transparent cover (sometimes combined with a lens) to protect the light source and reflector, a battery, and a switch, all enclosed in a case.

The invention of the dry cell and miniature incandescent electric lamps made the first battery-powered flashlights possible around 1899. Today, flashlights use mostly light-emitting diodes and run on disposable or rechargeable batteries. Some are powered by the user turning a crank, shaking the lamp, or squeezing it. Some have solar panels to recharge the battery. Flashlights are used as a light source outdoors, in places without permanently installed lighting, during power outages, or when a portable light source is needed.

In addition to the general-purpose, hand-held flashlight, many forms have been adapted for special uses. Head- or helmet-mounted flashlights designed for miners and campers leave both hands free. Some flashlights can be used under water or in flammable atmospheres.

== Etymology ==
Early flashlights ran on zinc–carbon batteries, which could not provide a steady electric current and required periodic &quot;rest&quot; to continue functioning. Because these early flashlights also used energy-inefficient carbon-filament bulbs, &quot;resting&quot; occurred at short intervals. Consequently, they could be used only in brief flashes, hence the common North American name &quot;flashlight&quot;.

== History ==

The first dry cell battery was invented in 1887. Unlike previous batteries, it used a paste electrolyte instead of a liquid. This was the first battery suitable for portable electrical devices, as it did not spill or break easily and worked in any orientation. The first mass-produced dry cell batteries came in 1896, and the invention of portable electric lights soon followed. Portable hand-held electric lights offered advantages in convenience and safety over (combustion) torches, candles and lanterns. The electric lamp was odorless, smokeless, and emitted less heat than combustion-powered lighting. It could be instantly turned on and off, and avoided fire risk.

On January 10, 1899, British inventor David Misell obtained U.S. Patent No. 617,592, assigned to American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company. This &quot;electric device&quot; designed by Misell was powered by &quot;D&quot; batteries laid front to back in a paper tube with the light bulb and a rough brass reflector at the end. The company donated some of these devices to the New York City police, who responded favorably to them.

Carbon-filament bulbs and fairly crude dry cells made early flashlights an expensive novelty, with low sales and low manufacturer interest. Development of the tungsten-filament lamp in 1904, with three times the efficacy of carbon filament types, along with improved batteries in varying sizes made flashlights more useful and popular. The advantage of instant control, and the absence of flame, meant that hand-held electric lights began to replace combustion-based lamps such as the hurricane lantern. 

By 1907, several types of flashlights were available: the tubular hand-held variety, a lantern style that could be set down for extended use, pocket-size penlights for close work, and large reflector searchlight-type lamps for lighting distant objects. In 1922 there were an estimated 10 million flashlight users in the United States, with annual sales of renewal batteries and flashlights at $20 million, comparable to sales of many line-operated electrical appliances. Flashlights became very popular in China; by the end of the 1930s, 60 companies made flashlights, some selling for as little as one-third the cost of equivalent imported models. Miniature lamps developed for flashlight and automotive uses became an important sector of the incandescent lamp manufacturing business.

LED flashlights were introduced in the early 2000s. Maglite made their first LED flashlight in 2006.

== Incandescent ==
Incandescent flashlights use incandescent light bulbs, which consists of a glass bulb and a tungsten filament. The bulbs are under vacuum or filled with argon, krypton, or xenon. Some high-power incandescent flashlights use a halogen lamp where the bulb contains a halogen gas such as iodine or bromine to improve the life and efficacy of the bulb. In all but disposable or novelty flashlights, the bulb is user-replaceable; the bulb life may be only a few hours.

The light output of an incandescent lamp in a flashlight varies widely depending on the type of lamp. A miniature keychain lamp produces one or two lumens. A two-D-cell flashlight using a common prefocus-style miniature lamp produces on the order of 15 to 20 lumens of light and a beam of about 200 candlepower. One popular make of rechargeable focusing flashlight uses a halogen lamp and produces 218 lumens. By comparison, a 60-watt household incandescent lamp will produce about 900 lumens. The luminous efficacy or lumens produced per watt of input of flashlight bulbs varies over the approximate range of 8 to 22 lumens/watt, depending on the size of the bulb and the fill gas, with halogen-filled 12-volt lamps having the highest efficiency.

== LED ==
Powerful white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have mostly replaced incandescent bulbs in practical flashlights. LEDs existed for decades, mainly as low-power indicator lights. In 1999, Lumileds Corporation of San Jose, California, introduced the Luxeon LED, a high-power white-light emitter. This made possible LED flashlights with lower power consumption and running time better than incandescent flashlights with similar light output. The first Luxeon LED flashlight was the Arc LS, designed in 2001. White LEDs in 5 mm diameter packages produce only a few lumens each; many units may be grouped together to provide additional light. Higher-power LEDs, drawing more than 100 milliamperes each, simplify the optical design problem of producing a powerful and tightly controlled beam.

LEDs can be significantly more efficient than incandescent lamps, with white LEDs producing on the order of 100 lumens for every watt, compared to 8-10 lumens per watt of small incandescent bulbs. An LED flashlight has a longer battery life than an incandescent flashlight with comparable output. LEDs are also less fragile than glass lamps. LED lamps have different spectra of light compared to incandescent sources, and are made in several ranges of color temperature and color rendering index. Since the LED has a long life compared to the usual life of a flashlight, very often it is permanently installed. Flashlights made for an incandescent lamp can often be upgraded to a more efficient LED lamp.

LEDs generally must have some kind of control to limit current through the diode. Flashlights using one or two disposable 1.5-volt cells require a boost converter to provide the higher voltage required by a white LED, which needs around 3.4 volts to function. Flashlights using three or more dry cells may only use a resistor to limit current. Some flashlights electronically regulate the current through the LEDs to stabilize light output as the batteries discharge. LEDs maintain nearly constant color temperature regardless of input voltage or current, while the color temperature of an incandescent bulb rapidly declines as the battery discharges, becoming redder and less visible. Regulated LED flashlights may also have user-selectable levels of output appropriate to a task, for example, low light for reading a map and high output for checking a road sign. This would be difficult to do with a single incandescent bulb since efficacy of the lamp drops rapidly at low output.

LED flashlights may consume 1 watt or much more from the battery, producing heat as well as light. In contrast to tungsten filaments, which must be hot to produce light, both the light output and the life of an LED decrease with temperature. Heat dissipation for the LED often dictates that small, high-power LED flashlights have aluminium or other high heat-conductivity bodies, reflectors, and other parts to dissipate heat; they can become warm during use.

Light output from LED flashlights varies even more widely than for incandescent lights. &quot;Keychain&quot; type lamps operating on button batteries, or lights using a single 5 mm LED, may only produce a few lumens. Even a small LED flashlight operating on an AA cell, but equipped with an LED, can emit 100 lumens. The most powerful LED flashlights produce more than 100,000 lumens and may use multiple LEDs.

LEDs are highly efficient at producing colored light compared with incandescent lamps and filters. An LED flashlight may contain different LEDs for white and colored light, selectable by the user for different purposes. Colored LED flashlights are used for signalling, special inspection tasks, forensic examination, or to track the blood trail of wounded game animals. A flashlight may have a red LED intended to preserve dark adaptation of vision. Ultraviolet LEDs may be used for inspection lights, for example, detecting fluorescent dyes added to air conditioning systems to detect leakage, examining paper currency, or checking UV-fluorescing marks on laundry or event ticket holders. Infrared LEDs can be used for illuminators for night-vision systems. LED flashlights may be specified to be compatible with night vision devices.
== HID ==
A less common type of flashlight uses a high-intensity discharge lamp (HID lamp) as the light source. An HID gas discharge lamp uses a mixture of metal halide salts and noble gas as a filler. HID lamps produce more light than a traditional incandescent flashlight using the same amount of electricity, though not as much as high power LEDs. The lamp lasts longer and is more shock resistant than a regular incandescent bulb, since it lacks the relatively fragile electrical filament found in incandescent bulbs. However, they are much more expensive than incandescent, due to the ballast circuit required to start and operate the lamp. An HID lamp requires a short warm-up time before it reaches full output.

== LEP ==

LEP stands for Laser Excited Phosphor. The light source is a blue laser diode, which is directed at a phosphor layer to make white light. With the first LEP flashlight available in 2018, there are currently a few dozen LEP flashlights, mainly from China. At the moment, there are 2 types of LEP modules used. The laser light either shines through the phosphor layer to produce white light, or is directed at the layer by a mirror. The mirror-type is built inside a plastic module, while the shine-through models are usually built with a copper/aluminum shell, and much smaller than the plastic type.

==Accessories==
Accessories for a flashlight allow the color of the light to be altered or allow light to be dispersed differently. Translucent colored plastic cones slipped over the lens of a flashlight increase the visibility when looking at the side of the light. Such marshalling wands are frequently used for directing automobiles or aircraft at night. Colored lenses placed over the end of the flashlight are used for signalling, for example, in railway yards. Colored light is occasionally useful for hunters tracking wounded game after dusk, or for forensic examination of an area. A red filter helps preserve night vision after the flashlight is turned off, and can be useful to observe animals (such as nesting loggerhead sea turtles) without disturbing them.

Detachable light guides, consisting of rigid, bent plastic rods or semirigid or flexible tubes containing optical fibers, are available for some flashlights for inspection inside tanks, or within walls or structures; when not required, the light guide can be removed and the light used for other purposes.

== Formats and specialized designs ==
A penlight is a small, pen-sized flashlight, often containing two AA or AAA batteries. In some types, the incandescent light bulb has an integral lens that focuses the light, so no reflector is built into the penlight. Others use incandescent bulbs mounted in reflectors. LED penlights are becoming increasingly common. Low-cost units may be disposable with no provision to replace batteries or bulbs and are sometimes imprinted with advertising for promotional purposes.

A headlamp is designed to be worn on the head, often having separate lamp and battery components. The battery pack may be attached at the back of the head or in a pocket to improve balance. Headlamps leave the users&#x27; hands&#x27; free. A headlamp can be clipped to the brim of a hat, or built to mount on a hard hat, instead of using straps; other types resemble eyeglass frames. Similar to the headlamp, an angle-head flashlight emits light perpendicular to the length of the battery tube; it can be clipped to a headband, belt, or webbing or set on a flat surface. Some types allow the user to adjust the angle of the head. The Fulton MX991/U Flashlight was an angle-head flashlight issued to US military personnel; similar style lights remain popular.

Tactical lights are sometimes mounted to a handgun or rifle. They allow momentary illumination of a target. They are small enough to be easily rail-mounted to a gun barrel. Tactical lights must withstand the impact of recoil and must be easily controlled while holding the weapon.

Although most flashlights are designed for user replacement of the batteries and the bulb as needed, fully sealed disposable flashlights, such as inexpensive keyring lights, are made. When the batteries are depleted or the bulb fails, the entire product is discarded.

Diving lamps must be watertight under pressure and are used for night diving and supplemental illumination where surface light cannot reach. The battery compartment of a dive lamp may have a catalyst to recombine any hydrogen gas emitted from the battery since gas cannot be vented in use.

People working in hazardous areas with significant concentrations of flammable gases or dusts, such as mines, engine rooms of ships, chemical plants, or grain elevators, use &quot;nonincendive&quot;, &quot;intrinsically safe&quot;, or &quot;explosion-proof&quot; flashlights constructed so that any spark in the flashlight is not likely to set off an explosion outside the light. The flashlight may require approval by an authority for the particular service and particular gases or dusts expected. The external temperature rise of the flashlight must not exceed the autoignition point of the gas, so substitution of more powerful lamps or batteries may void the approval.


Inspection flashlights have permanently mounted light guides containing optical fibers or plastic rods. Another style has a lamp mounted at the end of a flexible cable, or a semirigid or articulated probe. Such lamps are used for inspection inside tanks, or inside structures such as aircraft. Where used for inspecting the interior of tanks containing flammable liquids, the inspection lights may also be rated as flame-proof (explosion-proof) so that they cannot ignite liquids or vapors.

Otoscopes and ophthalmoscopes are medical instruments that combine a hand-held light source and magnifying lenses for examination of the ear canal and eyes, respectively.

Aboard naval ships, battle lanterns may be used as emergency portable lighting. Installed in major compartments of the ship, a battle lantern can be detached from its mounting and used as portable lighting in the event primary lighting is out of service. Battle lanterns may use either incandescent or LED lamps and may have either disposable primary or rechargeable batteries.

Many flashlights are cylindrical in design, with the lamp assembly attached to one end. However, early designs came in a variety of other shapes. Some resembled candlesticks, with a bulb mounted at the top of a battery tube fixed to a flat base, with a handle. Many resembled lanterns, consisting of a battery box with a handle and the lamp and reflector attached to the front. Electric lanterns are used for lighting the broad area immediately around the lantern, as opposed to forming a narrow beam; they can be set down on a level surface or attached to supports. Some electric lanterns use miniature fluorescent lamps for higher efficiency than incandescent bulbs. Portable hand-held electric spotlights can provide larger reflectors and lamps and more powerful batteries than tubular flashlights meant to fit in a pocket.
Multifunction portable devices may include a flashlight as one of their features, for example, a portable radio/flashlight combination. Many smartphones have a button or software application available to turn up their screen backlights to full intensity or to switch on the camera flash or video light, providing a &quot;flashlight&quot; function.

In addition to utilitarian flashlights, novelty, toy, and ornamental portable electric lights have been made in a myriad of shapes; in the 1890s, one of the earliest portable battery light applications was a type of novelty porcelain tie pin with a concealed bulb and battery.

== Power sources ==
===Batteries===
The most common power source for flashlights is the battery. Primary battery (disposable) types used in flashlights include button cells, carbon-zinc batteries in both regular and heavy duty types, alkaline, and lithium.

Secondary, rechargeable types include lead-acid batteries, NiMH, NiCd batteries and lithium-ion batteries. The choice of batteries plays a determining role in the size, weight, run time, and shape of the flashlight. Flashlight users may prefer a common battery type to simplify replacement.

Primary cells are most economical for infrequent use. Some types of lithium primary cell can be stored for years with less risk of leakage compared with zinc-type batteries. Long storage life is useful where flashlights are required only in emergencies. Lithium primary batteries are also useful at lower temperatures than zinc batteries, all of which have water-based electrolytes. Lithium primary batteries have a lower internal resistance than zinc primary batteries, so are more efficient in high-drain flashlights.

Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries. Flashlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle-charged and always ready when needed. Some rechargeable flashlights have indicators for the state of charge of the battery. Power-failure lights are designed to keep their batteries charged from a wall plug and to automatically turn on after an AC power failure; the power-failure light can be removed from the wall socket and used as a portable flashlight. Solar powered flashlights use energy from solar cells to charge an on-board battery for later use.

=== Mechanical power ===

One type of mechanically powered flashlight has a winding crank and spring connected to a small electrical generator (dynamo). Some types use the dynamo to charge a capacitor or battery, while others only light while the dynamo is moving. Others generate electricity using electromagnetic induction. They use a strong permanent magnet that can freely slide up and down a tube, passing through a coil of wire as it does. Shaking the flashlight charges a capacitor or a rechargeable battery that supplies current to a light source. Such flashlights can be useful during an emergency, when utility power and batteries may not be available. Dynamo-powered flashlights were popular during the Second World War since replacement batteries were difficult to find.

===Capacitor===
At least one manufacturer makes a rechargeable flashlight that uses a supercapacitor to store energy. The capacitor can be recharged more rapidly than a battery and can be recharged many times without loss of capacity; however, the running time is limited by the relative bulk of capacitors compared to electrochemical batteries.

==Reflectors and lenses==

A reflector with an approximately parabolic shape concentrates the light emitted by the bulb into a directed beam. Some flashlights allow the user to adjust the relative position of the lamp and reflector, giving a variable-focus effect from a wide floodlight to a narrow beam. Reflectors may be made of polished metal, glass, or plastic with an aluminized reflective finish. Some manufacturers use a pebbled or &quot;orange peel&quot;, instead of a smooth reflector, to improve the uniformity of the light beam emitted. Where multiple LEDs are used, each one may be put in its own parabolic reflector. Flashlights using a &quot;total internal reflection&quot; assembly have a transparent optical element (light pipe) to guide light from the source into a beam; no reflector surface is required. For a given size of light source, a larger reflector or lens allows a tighter beam to be produced, while capturing the same fraction of the emitted light. Some flashlights use Fresnel lenses, which allow the weight of the lens to be reduced.

The reflector may have a flat transparent cover to keep out dirt and moisture, but some designs have a plastic or glass &quot;bulls-eye&quot; lens to form a concentrated beam. The lens or reflector cover must resist impacts and the heat of the lamp, and must not lose too much of the transmitted light to reflection or absorption. Very small flashlights may not have a reflector or lens separate from the lamp. Some types of penlight bulbs or small LEDs have a built-in lens.

A reflector forms a narrow beam called the &quot;throw&quot; in hobbyist parlance, while light emitted forward misses the reflector and forms a wide flood or &quot;spill&quot; of light. Because LEDs emit most light in a hemisphere, lens lights with the LED facing forward or reflector lights with it facing backwards radiate less spill. Variable focus &quot;zoom&quot; or &quot;flood to throw&quot; lights may move the reflector or lens or they may move the emitter; moving the emitter presents the designer with the problem of maintaining heat dissipation for the LED.

==Control switch==
The original 1890s flashlights used a metal ring around the fiber body of the flashlight as one contact of a switch; the second contact was a movable metal loop that could be flipped down to touch the ring, completing the circuit. A wide variety of mechanical switch designs using slide switches, rocker switches, or side-mounted or end-mounted pushbuttons has been used in flashlights. A common combination is a slide switch that allows the light to be left on for an extended time, combined with a momentary button for intermittent use or signalling. (On earlier models, the button was a switch and the slider simply locked the button down.) Since voltages and currents are low, switch design is limited only by the available space and desired cost of production. Switches may be covered with a flexible rubber boot to exclude dirt and moisture and may be backlit for easy location. Another common type of switch relies on twisting the head of the light. Weapon-mounted lights may have remote switches for convenience in operation.

Electronic controls allow the user to select variable output levels or different operating modes such as pre-programmed flashing beacon or strobe modes. Electronic controls may be operated by buttons, sliders, magnets, rotating heads, or rotating control rings. Some models of flashlight include an acceleration sensor to allow them to respond to shaking, or to select modes based on what direction the light is held when switched on. At least one manufacturer allows user programming of the features of the flashlight through a USB port. An electronic control may also provide an indication of remaining battery capacity, voltage, or provide information regarding recharging or automatic step-down of brightness as the battery nears full discharge.

==Materials==
Early flashlights used vulcanized fiber or hard rubber tubes with metal end caps. Many other materials including drawn steel, plated brass, copper, or silver, and even wood and leather have been used. Modern flashlights are generally made of plastic or aluminum. Plastics range from low-cost polystyrene and polyethylene to more complex mixtures of ABS or glass-reinforced epoxies. Some manufacturers have proprietary plastic formulations for their products. A desirable plastic for manufacturing flashlights allows for ease of molding and adequate mechanical properties of the finished flashlight case. Aluminum, either plain, painted or anodized, is a popular choice. It is electrically conductive, can be easily machined, and dissipates heat well. Several standard alloys of aluminum are used. Other metals include copper, stainless steel, and titanium, which can be polished to provide a decorative finish. Zinc can be die-cast into intricate shapes. Magnesium and its alloys provide strength and heat dissipation similar to aluminum with less weight, but they corrode easily.

Metals may be drawn into a tubular shape, or tubular extruded stock can be machined to add threads for the head and tail cap, knurling for grip, and decorative and functional flats or holes in the body. LED flashlights may have cooling fins machined into their metal cases. Plastics are often injection molded into nearly final shape, requiring only a few more process steps to complete assembly.
Metal cases provide better heat dissipation for the LED, but plastics are not electrically conductive and may resist corrosion and wear.

==Ratings and standards==

===Safety regulations===
Industrial, marine, public safety, and military organizations develop specifications for flashlights in specialized roles. Typically, light output, overall dimensions, and battery compatibility and durability are required to meet minimum limits. Flashlights may be tested for impact resistance, water and chemical resistance, and the lifespan of the control switch.

Flashlights intended for use in hazardous areas with flammable gas or dust are tested to ensure they cannot set off an explosion. Flashlights approved for flammable gas areas have markings indicating the approving agency (MSHA, ATEX, UL, etc.) and symbols for the conditions that were tested. Flashlights for hazardous areas may be designed to automatically disconnect the lamp if the bulb is broken, to prevent ignition of flammable gas.

Regulations for ships and aircraft specify the number and general properties of flashlights included as part of the standard safety equipment of the vessel. Flashlights for small boats may be required to be waterproof and to float. Uniformed services may issue particular models of flashlights, or may provide minimum performance standards for their members to follow when purchasing their own flashlights.

===Performance standards===
The United States Army former standard MIL-F-3747E described the performance standard for plastic flashlights using two or three D-cell dry batteries, in either straight or angle form, and in standard, explosion-proof, heat-resistant, traffic direction, and inspection types. The standard described only incandescent lamp flashlights and was withdrawn in 1996.

In the United States, ANSI in 2009 published &quot;FL1 Flashlight basic performance standard&quot;. This voluntary standard defines test procedures and conditions for total light output, beam intensity, working distance, impact and water resistance, and battery running time to 10% of initial light output. The FL1 standard gives definitions for terms used in marketing flashlights, with the intention of allowing the consumer to compare products tested to the standard. The standard recommends particular graphic symbols and wording for the product package, so that the consumer can identify products tested to the standard. Testing may be carried out by the manufacturer itself or by a third-party test laboratory.

The FL1 standard requires measurements reported on the packaging to be made with the type of batteries packaged with the flashlight, or with an identified type of battery. Initial light output is measured with an integrating sphere photometer, 30 seconds after the light is switched on with fresh (or newly charged) batteries. The total light emitted is reported in lumens. Luminous intensity is determined by measuring the brightest spot in the beam produced by the flashlight, in candelas. Since this is a measure of all the light emitted in a solid angle (the &quot;cone&quot; of light in a particular direction), the beam intensity is independent of distance.

The working distance is defined as the distance at which the maximum light falling on a surface (illuminance) would fall to 0.25 lux. This is comparable to a full moon on a clear night. The distance is calculated from the square root of (the beam intensity in candelas divided by 0.25 lux); for example, a beam intensity of 1000 candelas produces a working range rating of the square root of (1000/0.25), or 63 meters. The result is reported in meters or feet. The working distance is from the point of view of the user of the flashlight. A light directly pointed at an observer may be visible against a dark background for many times this distance, especially if the observer has night-vision equipment.

Run time is measured using the supplied or specified batteries and letting the light run until the intensity of the beam has dropped to 10% of the value 30 seconds after switching on. The standard does not evaluate the behavior of the flashlight output during run time. A regulated flashlight may run at only a slowly declining output and then abruptly cut off, but unregulated types may have steeply-declining light output after only a short time. Manufacturers of headlamps may use a different standard which rates run times until light output falls to 1 lux at 2 meters distance; this value is not comparable to the FL 1 runtime measurement.

Impact resistance is measured by dropping the flashlight in six different orientations and observing that it still functions and has no large cracks or breaks in it; the height used in the test is reported. Water resistance, if specified, is evaluated after impact testing; no water is to be visible inside the unit and it must remain functional. Ratings are given in IP Code terms, where jet spray corresponds to IP X6, brief immersion to IPX7, 30 minutes immersion at 1 meter or more is IP X8; (the depth is reported if greater than 1 meter). An IP X8 rating by FL1 does not imply that the lamp is suitable for use as a diver&#x27;s light since the test protocol examines function of the light only after immersion, not during immersion.

The consumer must decide how well the ANSI test conditions match their requirements, but all manufacturers testing to the FL1 standard can be compared on a uniform basis. The light measurements are more directly related to the use of flashlights than is the nominal power input to the lamp (watts), since different LED and incandescent lamp types vary widely in the amount of light produced per watt. Even the same LED or lamp in different optical systems will show different beam characteristics. The visibility of objects depends on many factors as well as the amount of light emitted by the flashlight.

ANSI standard FL1 does not specify measurements of the beam width angle but the candela intensity and total lumen ratings can be used by the consumer to assess the beam characteristics. Where two flashlights have similar total light (lumen) measures, the unit with the higher candela rating produces a more concentrated beam of light, suitable for lighting distant objects; it will also have a higher working distance. If two lights have similar candela ratings, the light with higher lumen value will produce a wider beam and will light a wider area overall. A beam width (containing most of the power of the beam, or &quot;hot spot&quot;) of a few degrees corresponds to a spot light, useful for searching for distant objects; beam widths of 20 degrees or more are described as flood lights, suitable for lighting a wide nearby area. Typically even a flashlight beam with a small hot spot will have some light visible as &quot;spill&quot; around the spot.

In 2018, in the United States, Underwriter&#x27;s Laboratories published UL standard 1576 for flashlights and lanterns, outlining safety requirements and performance tests.

<doc id="243723" wikidata="Q1939097" url="?curid=243723" title="Mission of Burma">
<text>Mission of Burma was an American post-punk band from Boston, Massachusetts. The group formed in 1979 with Roger Miller on guitar, Clint Conley on bass, Peter Prescott on drums, and Martin Swope contributing audiotape manipulation and acting as the band’s sound engineer. In this initial lineup, Miller, Conley, and Prescott all shared singing and songwriting duties.

In their early years the band&#x27;s recordings were all released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite their initial success in the growing independent music circuit, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller&#x27;s development of tinnitus caused by the loud volume of the band&#x27;s live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, titled &quot;Vs.&quot;

Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope. The band released four more albums—&quot;ONoffON&quot;, &quot;The Obliterati&quot;, &quot;The Sound the Speed the Light&quot;, and &quot;Unsound&quot;—before it was revealed in June 2020 that they had amicably disbanded.

==History==

===Formation and early history===
Mission of Burma&#x27;s history began with a short-lived Boston rock group called Moving Parts. The band included Roger Miller, who had moved to Boston from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Clint Conley, who came from Darien, Connecticut. When Moving Parts broke up amicably in December 1978, Miller and Conley began practicing. Auditioning new drummers was accomplished, as Michael Azzerad puts it, &quot;by playing &#x27;out&#x27; music, such as Sun Ra and James Brown, until the applicant left.&quot; They eventually recruited ex-Molls drummer Peter Prescott, who had admired the music of Moving Parts.

They took their name from a &quot;Mission of Burma&quot; plaque Conley saw on a New York City diplomatic building; he thought the phrase had a &quot;sort of murky and disturbing&quot; quality. Mission of Burma made their debut on April 1, 1979 as a trio, performing at The Modern Theater. Later that month Miller wrote a song, &quot;Nu Disco&quot;, that he felt would be improved by a tape loop. Miller then contacted Martin Swope, with whom he had earlier written some John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen-inspired pieces for piano and tape. Swope was immediately enlisted as the group&#x27;s live audio engineer and occasional tape-effects artist. His latter role grew gradually, until by 1981 he was adding tape work to most of the group&#x27;s songs, and was regarded as an integral part of the group, appearing in group photographs and receiving equal credit on recordings.

From the start, Mission of Burma received support from local music magazine &quot;Boston Rock&quot;, which printed a lengthy interview with the band before they released their first record, and MIT community radio station WMBR. The station played Conley&#x27;s &quot;Peking Spring&quot; repeatedly, and it became the station&#x27;s most-played song of 1979. Mission of Burma wanted to release the song as a single, but by the time they had found a label, they felt the song had run its course.

===&quot;Signals&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot;===
By 1981, the band signed a record deal with the Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Their debut single was Conley&#x27;s &quot;Academy Fight Song&quot;, with Miller&#x27;s &quot;Max Ernst&quot; (titled after the dada artist) as the B-side. Rick Harte&#x27;s layered production was far more refined than the band&#x27;s ragged live performances, and the band initially objected to the single. However, the first pressing of the single sold out quickly, and the band thereafter trusted Harte&#x27;s judgment.

Their debut release, the EP &quot;Signals, Calls, and Marches&quot;, was released in 1981. By the end of that year, the EP had sold out its initial pressing of 10,000
copies.

In 1982, Mission of Burma released their first full-length album, &quot;Vs.&quot;. The album has since seen wide praise; one review notes &quot;very few American bands from the 1980s released an album as ambitious or as powerful as &quot;Vs.&quot;, and it still sounds like a classic&quot;.

In February 1982, the band recorded a two-song single in collaboration with vocalist Dan Ireton under the name Dredd Foole and the Din. Several members played instruments that they did not play in Mission of Burma, with Miller on organ, Conley handling lead guitar, and Swope joining more directly in the instrumentation on prepared bass. The collaboration was further developed with a series of live shows, which continued nearly a year beyond Mission of Burma&#x27;s breakup in 1983. This was Mission of Burma&#x27;s only collaboration during their initial period of activity (1979–1983).

===Breakup and aftermath===
In 1983, after the release of &quot;Vs.&quot;, the group disbanded due to Miller&#x27;s worsening tinnitus, attributed in large part to their notoriously loud live performances—during their farewell tour, Miller took to augmenting his usual small foam earplugs with rifle-range earphones onstage. A live compilation, &quot;The Horrible Truth About Burma&quot;, was assembled of recordings from the farewell tour and released on Ace of Hearts in 1985. In 1988, Rykodisc released a compilation album, &quot;Mission of Burma&quot;, the first compact disc to exceed 80 minutes of playing time.

Miller and Swope then turned their attention to their side project, the quieter Birdsongs of the Mesozoic (co-founded with their old friend Erik Lindgren, who had played with Miller and Conley in Moving Parts), which they both left in the 1990s, Miller to produce several solo efforts and film scores, and Swope to semi-reclusion in Hawaii. Prescott remained active in the Boston music scene, forming Volcano Suns and later Kustomized and The Peer Group. Other than producing Yo La Tengo&#x27;s debut record, Conley dropped out of music, working as a producer for Boston television station WCVB&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;Chronicle&quot; until he formed the band Consonant in 2001.

===Reunion===
While disbanded, Mission of Burma garnered a larger fanbase. In the 1980s and 90s, Taang! Records and Rykodisc kept the band&#x27;s music in print via reissues of the Ace of Hearts catalog as well as unreleased recordings. Mission of Burma was also one of the 13 groups featured in Michael Azerrad&#x27;s book &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991&quot;, marking them as an iconic group in the American indie rock canon.

In 2002, Mission of Burma reunited but without Swope as he declined to join. Conley, Miller and Prescott instead played reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott&#x27;s Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller related that &quot;when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin&#x27;s position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin&#x27;s antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.&quot; Weston later began using a digital looping box from Electro-Harmonix in 2007 during live performances, but still continued to use actual tape loops in the studio. Weston would also regularly join the band onstage during encores, playing bass while Conley played second guitar.

The band initially planned on playing just two reunion gigs, one in Boston and another in New York. When tickets sold out very quickly and concert dates expanded to two nights in New York and three in Boston, Mission of Burma decided to re-form more permanently to tour and record new material.

A new album, &quot;ONoffON&quot;, was produced in 2004 by Weston with Rick Harte and the band, and released by Matador Records in May. The album finished 90th in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critic&#x27;s poll. They also released &quot;Snapshot&quot;, a live recording of the reunited lineup, through online digital channels. In September 2005, the band returned to the studio with Weston for an album tentatively titled (among other names) &quot;Aluminum Washcloth&quot; and rechristened &quot;The Obliterati&quot;. Released in May 2006, again on Matador, it ranked #33 of best records of 2006 by Pitchfork Media and placed 50th in the Pazz &amp; Jop poll.

In 2006, a documentary about the band was released entitled &quot;Not a Photograph: The Mission of Burma Story&quot;. In March 2008, Matador re-released remastered versions of &quot;Signals, Calls, and Marches&quot;, &quot;Vs&quot;., and &quot;The Horrible Truth About Burma&quot; from the band&#x27;s original era. In an interview with the &quot;L.A. Record&quot; later that year, Prescott explained that the sheer physical exertion involved in performing Mission of Burma songs meant that the band could only play together for a &quot;couple more years at most.&quot;

In 2009 the band recorded 14 tracks for their fourth full-length studio album, &quot;The Sound The Speed The Light&quot;. Matador released a two non-album songs on a 7″ single in August and the full album in October.

In 2012 Mission of Burma parted ways with Matador and recorded their fifth full-length album, &quot;Unsound&quot;, for Fire Records. The album saw release in July 2012, preceded by the single &quot;Dust Devil&quot;.

In a 2019 Facebook post, it was revealed that the band has no plans to make further albums. In June 2020, Boston NPR affiliate WBUR-FM reported that the band had amicably disbanded, with Conley, Miller and Prescott remaining &quot;good friends.&quot; Their last live performance took place in 2016 in Berlin.

==Musical style==

===Songwriting===
Throughout Mission of Burma’s career, Roger Miller and Clint Conley handled most of the singing and songwriting, with Peter Prescott contributing a few songs per record as well. Music critic Franklin Bruno described Conley as a &quot;hook machine&quot; while Miller&#x27;s songs tended to be more unorthodox, both lyrically and structurally. Conley’s composition &quot;That&#x27;s When I Reach for My Revolver&quot; remains Mission of Burma’s most well known song having been covered by Moby, Graham Coxon, and Catherine Wheel.

=== Tape manipulation ===
Prescott explained Swope&#x27;s methods in a 1997 interview: &quot;What Martin did ... was tape something that was going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn&#x27;t predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there.&quot; Swope&#x27;s tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s When I Reach For My Revolver&quot;), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot;). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: &quot;A lot of people never knew about Swope&#x27;s contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments.&quot; Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma&#x27;s sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.

===Live performances===

Mission of Burma’s early gigs were notorious for being hit-or-miss and represented far more rough-edged sound than the band’s studio recordings. This is reflected by the title of the band’s early live album, &quot;The Horrible Truth About Burma&quot;—an in-joke about their inconsistency as an onstage act. Boston music critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live from the band’s early days: &quot;When they were good, they were very very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that was the nature of the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether you were going to get one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or if it was going to be a ball of incomprehensible noise.&quot; While the band&#x27;s improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope&#x27;s tape work contributed to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren&#x27;t up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band&#x27;s trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band&#x27;s set lists were composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage, and could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.

==Legacy==
Numerous bands and artists have cited Burma as an influence, including Foo Fighters, the Replacements, Thurston Moore, Hüsker Dü bassist Greg Norton, Buffalo Tom, Drive Like Jehu, Unwound, Metz, and the Dirtbombs.

Artists such as Grand Theft Audio, Scott Sorry, Catherine Wheel, Graham Coxon, Pegboy, Moby and Down by Law have all covered Conley&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s When I Reach for My Revolver,” while both R.E.M. and Miracle Legion have performed cover versions of Mission of Burma’s first single, &quot;Academy Fight Song&quot;—the former on both their &quot;Green&quot; tour and a 1989 fan club single, and the latter on their debut album, &quot;Surprise Surprise Surprise&quot;. 

The indie rock band Versus also took their name from the Mission of Burma album &quot;Vs.&quot;

In 2009 the Boston City Council declared October 4th to be &quot;Mission of Burma Day&quot; in honor of the band&#x27;s work in a ceremony held across the river in Cambridge at MIT.

<text>A skald, or skáld (Old Norse: ; , meaning &quot;poet&quot;), is one of the often named poets who composed skaldic poetry, one of the two kinds of Old Norse poetry in alliterative verse, the other being Eddic poetry. Skaldic poems were traditionally composed to honor kings, but were sometimes ex tempore. They include both extended works and single verses (&quot;lausavísur&quot;). They are characteristically more ornate in form and diction than eddic poems, employing many kennings, which require some knowledge of Norse mythology, and heiti, which are formal nouns used in place of more prosaic synonyms. &quot;Dróttkvætt&quot; metre is a type of skaldic verse form that most often use internal rhyme and alliteration.

More than 5,500 skaldic verses have survived, preserved in more than 700 manuscripts, including in several sagas and in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a handbook of skaldic composition that led to a revival of the art. Many of these verses are fragments of originally longer works, and the authorship of many is unknown. The earliest known skald from whom verses survive is Bragi Boddason, known as Bragi the Old, a Norwegian skald of the first half of the 9th century. Most known skalds were attached to the courts of Norwegian kings during the Viking Age, and increasingly were Icelanders. The subject matter of their extended poems was sometimes mythical before the conversion to Christianity, thereafter usually historical and encomiastic, detailing the deeds of the skald&#x27;s patron. The tradition continued into the Late Middle Ages.

The standard edition of the skaldic poetic corpus, &quot;Den norsk-islandske skjaldedigtning&quot;, was edited by Finnur Jónsson and published in 1908–1915. A new edition was prepared online by the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages project and began publication in 2007.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;skald&quot; (which internal rhymes show to have had a short vowel until the 14th century) is perhaps ultimately related to (). Old High German has , and . The Old High German variant stem , etymologically identical to the &quot;skald-&quot; stem (), means &quot;to scold, blame, accuse, insult&quot;. The person doing the insulting is a or . The West Germanic counterpart of the skald is the . Like , which is related to Modern English &quot;scoff&quot;, the word &quot;skald&quot; is probably cognate with English &quot;scold&quot;, reflecting the importance of mocking taunts in the poetry of the skalds.

==Skaldic poetry==

Skaldic poetry and Eddic poetry stem from the same tradition of alliterative verse, and in Old Norse as well as Icelandic, the word &quot;skald&quot; simply means &quot;poet&quot; or &quot;composer&quot;. Skaldic verse is distinguished from Eddic by characteristically being more complex in style and by using &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; (&quot;court metre&quot;), which requires internal rhyme as well as alliteration, rather than the simpler and older &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; (&quot;way of ancient words&quot;), &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; (&quot;song form&quot;), and &quot;málaháttr&quot; (&quot;speech form&quot;) metres of the Eddic poems. Skaldic poetry is also characteristically more ornate in its diction, using more interlacing of elements of meaning within the verse and many more kennings and &quot;heiti&quot;. This both assisted in meeting the greater technical demands of the metre and allowed the poets to display their skill in wordplay. The resulting complexity can appear somewhat hermetic to modern readers, as well as creating ambiguity in interpretation; but the original audiences would have been familiar with the conventions of the syntactic interweaving as well as the vocabulary of the kennings.

Eddic poems are characterized by their mythological, ethical, and heroic content, while skaldic verse has a wider range of subject matter. One of the main topics was mighty kings and the deeds of courtly patrons. Eddic poetry typically includes a large amount of dialogue and rarely recounts battles; skaldic poetry, the reverse. Skalds also composed spontaneous verses reacting to events, insult verses (&quot;níðvísur&quot;) such as Þorleifr jarlsskáld&#x27;s curse on his former patron Jarl Hákon Sigurðarson and the &quot;níð&quot; that provoked the missionary Þangbrandr into killing Vetrliði Sumarliðason, and occasionally love poems and erotic verse called &quot;mansöngr&quot;. Hallfreðr Óttarsson and especially Kormákr Ögmundarson are known for their love poetry. 

A large amount of Eddic poetry has been preserved in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; manuscript. Skaldic verses are preserved in a large number of manuscripts, including many sagas, and some skaldic poetry, including prophetic, dream, and memorial poems, uses the simpler metres. Medieval Scandinavians appear to have distinguished between older and more modern poetry rather than considering skaldic verse as a distinct genre. 

Compositions done without preparation were especially valued, to judge by the sagas. Egill Skallagrímsson is supposed to have composed his &quot;Höfuðlausn&quot; in one night to ransom his head. King Harald Hardrada is said to have set his skald, Þjóðólfr Arnórsson, as he was walking down the street, to compose two stanzas casting a quarreling smith and tanner through the choice of kennings as specific figures first from mythology and then from heroic legend. It is not common though that skaldic verse are a spur of the moment thing.

Although there is no evidence that the skalds employed musical instruments, some speculate that they may have accompanied their verses with the harp or lyre.

===Forms===
A large number of the preserved skaldic verses are individual stanzas, called &quot;lausavísur&quot; (&quot;loose verses&quot;), often said to have been improvised. Long forms include the drápa, a praise poem consisting of a series of stanzas with a refrain (&quot;stef&quot;) at intervals, and the flokkr (similar to &quot;drápa&quot;, without a refrain), vísur ‘verses, stanzas’, or dræplingr ‘little drápa’, a shorter series of verses without refrain. There are also some shield poems, which supposedly describe mythological scenes on a shield presented to the poet by a patron.

===Poems===
Most of the longer skaldic poems were composed by court poets to honor kings and jarls. They typically have historical content, relating battles and other deeds from the king&#x27;s career. Examples include:
* &quot;Glymdrápa&quot; ‒ the deeds of King Harald Fairhair, by Þorbjörn Hornklofi, partially preserved
* &quot;Vellekla&quot; ‒ the deeds of Jarl Hákon Sigurðarson, by Einarr skálaglamm, partially preserved
* &quot;Bandadrápa&quot; ‒ the deeds of Jarl Eiríkr Hákonarson by Eyjólfr dáðaskáld, partially preserved 
* &quot;Knútsdrápa&quot; ‒ the deeds of King Cnut the Great, three poems by Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti, and Óttarr svarti (partially preserved)
* &quot;Geisli&quot; ‒ the deeds of King Olaf Haraldsson, Saint Olaf, a Christian drápa by Einarr Skúlason
* &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot; ‒ by Þorbjörn Hornklofi describing life and martial deeds of Harald Fairhair

A few surviving skaldic poems have mythological content:
* &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, a shield poem by Bragi Boddason, partially preserved: originally consisted of sections on two mythological scenes and two from the deeds of his patron, Ragnarr
* &quot;Haustlöng&quot; ‒ a shield poem by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, partially preserved
* &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; ‒ by Úlfr Uggason describing mythological scenes depicted on the walls of Olaf the Peacock&#x27;s feast hall in Iceland, partially preserved
* &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; ‒ deeds of the god Thor, two partially preserved poems by Eilífr Goðrúnarson and Eysteinn Valdason
* &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; ‒ on the mythological and legendary history of the Ynglings, presented as ancestors of the Norwegian kings, by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir
* &quot;Háleygjatal&quot; ‒ a similar work on the Hlaðir dynasty, by Eyvindr skáldaspillir

To these could be added two poems relating the death of a king and his reception in Valhalla:
* &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; ‒ on the death of King Eric Bloodaxe, by an unknown skald
* &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; ‒ on the death of King Hákon the Good, by Eyvindr skáldaspillir

Some extended works were composed as circumstance pieces, such as the following by Egill Skallagrímsson:
* &quot;Sonatorrek&quot; ‒ a lament on the deaths of his sons
* &quot;Höfuðlausn&quot; ‒ in praise of Eric Bloodaxe, his enemy, to ransom his head
* &quot;Arinbjarnarkviða&quot; ‒ in praise of his friend Arinbjörn

==History==
The origin story for poetry comes from a myth by Snorri Sturlson. The story depicts poetry as a liquid that takes various forms. The point of this is to show that poetry has gone through and will continue to go through change. The &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; metre appears to have been an innovation associated with a new fashion in formally more elaborate poetry associated with named poets. The metre has been compared to Irish and Latin poetic forms, which may have influenced its development. Origins in magic have also been suggested, because of the existence of skaldic curses (such as Egill Skallagrímsson&#x27;s on King Eric Bloodaxe) and because there are 10th-century magical inscriptions on runestones in the metre. Since the first example of skaldic poetry of which we know is Bragi Boddason&#x27;s &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot; from the early 9th century, some have argued that he and his associates invented it, but his work is already highly accomplished, suggesting that this style of poetry had been developing for some time. Bragi (whom many scholars consider was deified as the god Bragi) was a Norwegian, and skaldic poetry is thought to have originated in either Norway or the Scandinavian Baltic.

Most of the skalds of whom we know spent all or part of their careers as court poets, either those of kings, particularly the kings of Norway, or those of jarls, particularly the Hlaðir jarls, a dynasty based in what is now Trøndelag some of whose members ruled all or part of Norway as heathens in alternation with the Christian converters King Olaf Tryggvason and King Olaf Haraldsson (Saint Olaf). They produced praise poetry telling of their patrons&#x27; deeds, which became an orally transmitted record and was subsequently cited in history sagas. One example of this is the Heimskringla by Snorri Sturlson. A third of the book focuses on Olaf II Haraldsson. Their accuracy has been the subject of debate, but the verse form guards against corruption and the skalds traditionally criticized as well as advised their patrons. Skalds at the court at Hlaðir have been credited with developing the Valhalla complex and the cult of Odin as an aristocratic, educated form of heathenism influenced by Christian eschatology. Poetic ability was highly valued; the art was practised by the Norwegian kings themselves, and several skalds, such as Egill Skallagrímsson, are the subject of their own biographical sagas.
Icelandic skalds came to dominate at Norwegian courts; the last prominent Norwegian skald was Eyvindr skáldaspillir, and from the second half of the 10th century, all known court skalds were from Iceland or the Orkney Islands. By the end of the 10th century, skaldic poetry had become increasingly internally complex, and in the 11th century Christian skalds reacted against this complexity by using far fewer kennings, especially avoiding those referencing heathen deities. In the 12th century, a century after the conversion of Iceland, some skalds reintroduced heathen kennings as literary formulae, interest in ancient tradition was revived, and &quot;drápur&quot; were produced on historical figures, such as Einarr Skúlason&#x27;s &quot;Geisli&quot; on Olaf Tryggvason, composed 150 years after his death. Skalds experimented with new metres, notably &quot;hrynhent&quot;, which uses longer lines than &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; and was probably influenced by Latin metres. This metre arose in the 10th century and was popularized in the 11th by Arnórr jarlaskáld, whose &quot;Hrynhenda&quot; (c. 1045} is about King Magnus the Good; in the 12th century it was the dominant metre of religious skaldic poetry.

Despite these adaptations, the skaldic tradition itself was endangered by the popularity of newer and simpler forms of poetry and loss of knowledge of the kenning tradition. Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a handbook produced around 1220 that includes a guide to the metres, an explanation of kennings and their mythological and heroic bases grounded in contemporary learning, and numerous examples that preserve many skaldic verses, enabled skaldic poetry to continue in Iceland after the tradition of court poetry ended in the 13th century.

Christian religious poetry became an increasingly important part of the skaldic tradition beginning in the 12th century. Eysteinn Ásgrímsson&#x27;s &quot;Lilja&quot; was particularly influential: it uses the &quot;hrynhent&quot; metre and almost no kennings, and was much imitated. Christian skaldic poetry died out in Iceland only with the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, although that produced after 1400 is rarely studied as part of the skaldic corpus.

===Notable skalds===
More than 300 skalds are known from the period between 800 and 1200 AD. Many are listed in the &quot;Skáldatal&quot;, a list of court skalds by the ruler they served that runs from the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok to the late 13th century and includes some poets from whom no verses are preserved. Notable names include:

* Bragi Boddason &quot;the Old&quot;, early 9th century

* Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, active &quot;c.&quot; 900
* Eyvindr skáldaspillir, 10th century
* Egill Skallagrímsson, first half of the 10th century, protagonist of &quot;Egils saga&quot;

* Einarr Skúlason, 12th century
* Eysteinn Ásgrímsson, mid-14th century, monk who adapted skaldic tradition to high medieval Christianity

Many &quot;lausavísur&quot; attributed in sagas to women have traditionally been regarded as inauthentic, and few female skalds are known by name. They include:

* Hildr Hrólfsdóttir, 9th century
* Jórunn skáldmær, first half of the 10th century
* Steinunn Refsdóttir, late 10th century
* Steinvör Sighvatsdóttir, 13th century

==Editions==
The first comprehensive edition of skaldic poetry, by Finnur Jónsson, was &quot;Den norsk-islandske skjaldedigtning&quot;, published in 4 volumes in Copenhagen in 1908–15 (2 volumes each diplomatic and corrected text; with Danish translations). Later editions include &#x27;s &quot;Den norsk-isländska Skaldedigtningen&quot;, published in 2 volumes in Lund in 1946–50, and Magnus Olsen&#x27;s &quot;Edda- og Skaldekvad: forarbeider til kommentar&quot;, published in 7 volumes in Oslo in 1960–64 (analysis in Norwegian). In the early 21st century, the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages project has prepared a new edition with associated database online; 5 of a projected 9 volumes had been published . This edition groups the poems according to the type of prose source in which they are preserved.

== In popular culture ==

* Polish rock group Skaldowie (literally &quot;The Skalds&quot;), which debuted in 1965, takes its name form the skalds.
* Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages released in 2007.
* Norwegian folk group Wardruna released in 2018 an album titled &quot;Skald&quot;, which included a track by the same name.
* French neofolk group Skáld borrowed its name from the skalds.
* Swedish power metal group Sabaton frequently themes songs around historic battles and wars, analogous to old skald poems.
