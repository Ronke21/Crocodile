<text>Borders are generally defined as geographical boundaries, imposed either by features such as oceans and terrain, or by political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Political borders can be established through warfare, colonization, or mutual agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas.

Some borders—such as most states&#x27; internal administrative borders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area—are open and completely unguarded. Most external political borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints; adjacent border zones may also be controlled. For the purposes of border control, airports and seaports are also classed as borders. Most countries have some form of border control to regulate or limit the movement of people, animals, and goods into and out of the country. Under international law, each country is generally permitted to legislate the conditions that have to be met in order to cross its borders, and to prevent people from crossing its borders in violation of those laws.


Buffer zones may be set up on borders between belligerent entities to lower the risk of escalation. While &quot;border&quot; refers to the boundary itself, the area around the border is called the frontier.

== History ==
In the pre-modern world, the term &quot;border&quot; was vague and could refer to either side of the boundary, thus it was necessary to specify part of it with &quot;borderline&quot; or &quot;borderland&quot;. During the medieval period the government&#x27;s control frequently diminished the further people got from the capital. Therefore borderland (especially impassable terrain) attracted many outlaws, as they often found sympathizers.

In the past, many borders were not clearly defined lines; instead there were often intervening areas often claimed and fought over by both sides, sometimes called marchlands. Special cases in modern times were the Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone from 1922 to 1991 and the Saudi Arabian–Kuwaiti neutral zone from 1922 until 1970. In modern times, marchlands have been replaced by clearly defined and demarcated borders.

== Classification ==
=== Political borders ===
Political borders are imposed on the world through human agency. That means that although a political border may follow a river or mountain range, such a feature does not automatically define the political border, even though it may be a major physical barrier to crossing.

Political borders are often classified by whether or not they follow conspicuous physical features on the earth. William Miles said that Britain and France traced close to 40% of the entire length of the world&#x27;s international boundaries.

=== Natural borders ===

Natural borders are geographical features that present natural obstacles to communication and transport. Existing political borders are often a formalization of such historical, natural obstacles.

Some geographical features that often constitute natural borders are:
* Oceans: oceans create very costly natural borders. Very few countries span more than one continent. Only very large and resource-rich states are able to sustain the costs of governance across oceans for longer periods of time.
* Rivers: Some political borders have been formalized along natural borders formed by rivers. If a precise line is desired, it is often drawn along the thalweg, the deepest line along the river.
* Lakes: larger lakes create natural borders.
* Forests: denser jungles or forests can create strong natural borders.
* Mountain ranges: Many nations have their political borders defined along mountain ranges, often along a drainage divide.

Throughout history, technological advances have reduced the costs of transport and communication across the natural borders. That has reduced the significance of natural borders over time. As a result, political borders that have been formalized more recently, such as those in Africa or Americas, typically conform less to natural borders than very old borders, such as those in Europe or Asia, do.

=== Landscape borders ===
A landscape border is a mixture of political and natural borders. One example is the defensive forest created by China&#x27;s Song dynasty in the eleventh century. Such a border is political in the sense that it is human-demarcated, usually through a treaty. However, a landscape border is not demarcated by fences and walls but instead landscape features such as forests, mountains, and water bodies. It is different from a natural border, however, in the sense that the border landscape is not natural but human-engineered. Such a landscape usually differs from the borderland&#x27;s natural geography and its building requires tremendous human labour and financial investment.

=== Geometric borders ===
Geometric boundaries are formed by straight lines (such as lines of latitude or longitude), or occasionally arcs (Pennsylvania/Delaware), regardless of the physical and cultural features of the area. Such political boundaries are often found around the states that developed out of colonial holdings, such as in North America, Africa and the Middle East. The Canada–United States border follows the 49th parallel for roughly from Lake of the Woods (Ontario and Minnesota) west to the Pacific Ocean.

=== Fiat borders ===
A generalization of the idea of geometric borders is the idea of fiat boundaries by which is meant any sort of boundary that does not track an underlying &quot;bona fide&quot; physical discontinuity (&quot;fiat&quot;, Latin for &quot;let it be done&quot;, a decision). Fiat boundaries are typically the product of human demarcation, such as in demarcating electoral districts or postal districts.

=== Relic borders ===
A relic border is a former boundary, which may no longer be a legal boundary at all. However, the former presence of the boundary can still be seen in the landscape. For instance, the boundary between East and West Germany is no longer an international boundary, but it can still be seen because of historical markers on the landscape; it remains a cultural and economic demarcation in Germany. Other examples include the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam (defunct since 1975) and the border between North and South Yemen (defunct since 1990). Occasionally a relic border is reconstituted in some form, for example the border between British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland ceased to exist when the two colonies merged to form the independent state of Somalia in 1960, however when the former British Somaliland declared independence in 1991 it claimed the former British-Italian line as its eastern border.

=== Lines of control ===
A line of control (LoC) refers to a militarized buffer border between two or more nations that has yet to achieve permanent border status. LoC borders are typically under military control and are not recognized as an official international border. Formally known as a cease-fire line, an LoC was first created with the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan. Similar to a cease-fire line, an LoC is typically the result of war, military stalemates and unresolved land ownership conflict.

=== Maritime borders ===

A maritime border is a division enclosing an area in the ocean where a nation has exclusive rights over the mineral and biological resources, encompassing maritime features, limits and zones. Maritime borders represent the jurisdictional borders of a maritime nation and are recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Maritime borders exist in the context of territorial waters, contiguous zones, and exclusive economic zones; however, the terminology does not encompass lake or river boundaries, which are considered within the context of land boundaries.

Some maritime borders have remained indeterminate despite efforts to clarify them. This is explained by an array of factors, some of which illustrate regional problems.

=== Airspace borders ===
Airspace is the atmosphere located within a country&#x27;s controlled international and maritime borders. All sovereign countries hold the right to regulate and protect air space under the international law of Air sovereignty. The horizontal boundaries of airspace are similar to the policies of &quot;high seas&quot; in maritime law. Airspace extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of a country and it holds responsibility for protecting its own airspace unless under NATO peacetime protection. With international agreement a country can assume the responsibility of protecting or controlling the atmosphere over International Airspaces such as the Pacific Ocean. The vertical boundaries of airspace are not officially set or regulated internationally. However, there is a general agreement of vertical airspace ending at the point of the Kármán line. The Kármán line is a peak point at the altitude of 62 mi (100 km) above the Earth&#x27;s surface, setting a boundary between the atmosphere (airspace) and outer space (which is governed by space law).

=== Frontier ===

The frontier is a border that is open-ended to one side, identifying an expanding borderland to one side.

This type of border can be fairly abstract and has been identified as a particular state of mind for human activity. As such frontiers have been applied to borderlands identifying and claiming them as terra nullius, such as Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica, the only territory in Antarctica unclaimed by any sovereign nation.

== Types of border regulation ==

In places where smuggling, migration, and infiltration are a problem, many countries fortify borders with fences and barriers, and institute formal border control procedures. These can extend inland, as in the United States where the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service has jurisdiction to operate up to 100 miles from any land or sea boundary. On the other hand, some borders are merely signposted. This is common in countries within the European Schengen Area and on rural sections of the Canada–United States border. Borders may even be completely unmarked, typically in remote or forested regions; such borders are often described as &quot;porous&quot;. Migration within territorial borders, and outside of them, represented an old and established pattern of movement in African countries, in seeking work and food, and to maintain ties with kin who had moved across the previously porous borders of their homelands. When the colonial frontiers were drawn, Western countries attempted to obtain a monopoly on the recruitment of labor in many African countries, which altered the practical and institutional context in which the old migration patterns had been followed, and some might argue, are still followed today. The frontiers were particularly porous for the physical movement of migrants, and people living in borderlands easily maintained transnational cultural and social networks.

=== Regulated borders ===
Regulated borders have varying degrees of control on the movement of persons and trade between nations and jurisdictions. Most industrialized nations have regulations on entry and require one or more of the following procedures: visa check, passport check or customs checks. Most regulated borders have regulations on immigration, types of wildlife and plants, and illegal objects such as drugs or weapons. Overall border regulations are placed by national and local governments and can vary depending on nation and current political or economic conditions. Some of the most regulated borders in the world include: Australia, the United States, Israel, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. These nations have government-controlled border agencies and organizations that enforce border regulation policies on and within their borders.

=== Open borders ===
An open border is the deregulation and or lack of regulation on the movement of persons between nations and jurisdictions. This definition does not apply to trade or movement between privately owned land areas. Most nations have open borders for travel within their nation of travel, though more authoritarian states may limit the freedom of internal movement of its citizens, as for example in the former USSR. However, only a handful of nations have deregulated open borders with other nations, an example of this being European countries under the Schengen Agreement or the open Belarus-Russia border. Open borders used to be very common amongst all nations, however this became less common after the First World War, which led to the regulation of open borders, making them less common and no longer feasible for most industrialized nations. An example of Open orders include the Schengen Area where 29 European nations mutually abolished their border control.

=== Demilitarized zones ===

A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a border separating two or more nations, groups or militaries that have agreed to prohibit the use of military activity or force within the border&#x27;s bounds. A DMZ can act as a war boundary, ceasefire line, wildlife preserve, or a &quot;de facto&quot; international border. An example of a demilitarized international border is the 38th parallel between North and South Korea. Other notable DMZ zones include Antarctica and outer space (consisting of all space 100 miles away from the earth&#x27;s surface), both are preserved for world research and exploration. The prohibition of control by nations can make a DMZ unexposed to human influence and thus developed into a natural border or wildlife preserve, such as on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone, and the Green Line in Cyprus.

== Border economics ==


Borders undermine economic activity and development by reducing trade activity.

The presence of borders often fosters certain economic features or anomalies. Wherever two jurisdictions come into contact, special economic opportunities arise for border trade. Smuggling provides a classic case; contrariwise, a border region may flourish on the provision of excise or of import–export services — legal or quasi-legal, corrupt or legitimate. Different regulations on either side of a border may encourage services to position themselves at or near that border: thus the provision of pornography, of prostitution, of alcohol, fireworks, and/or of narcotics may cluster around borders, city limits, county lines, ports and airports. In a more planned and official context, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) often tend to cluster near borders or ports.

Even if the goods are not perceived to be undesirable, states will still seek to document and regulate the cross-border trade in order to collect tariffs and benefit from foreign currency exchange revenues. Thus, there is the concept unofficial trade in goods otherwise legal; for example, the cross-border trade in livestock by pastoralists in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia sells an estimated $250 to $300 million of livestock to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti every year unofficially, over 100 times the official estimate.

Human economic traffic across borders (apart from kidnapping) may involve mass commuting between workplaces and residential settlements. The removal of internal barriers to commerce, as in France after the French Revolution or in Europe since the 1940s, de-emphasizes border-based economic activity and fosters free trade. Euroregions are similar official structures built around commuting across boundary.

== Politics ==

Political borders have a variety of meanings for those whom they affect. Many borders in the world have checkpoints where border control agents inspect persons and/or goods crossing the boundary.

Some borders require presentation of legal paperwork like passports and visas, or other identity documents, for persons to cross borders. To stay or work within a country&#x27;s borders aliens (foreign persons) may need special immigration documents or permits; but possession of such documents does not guarantee that the person should be allowed to cross the border.

Moving goods across a border often requires the payment of excise tax, often collected by customs officials. Animals (and occasionally humans) moving across borders may need to go into quarantine to prevent the spread of exotic infectious diseases. Most countries prohibit carrying illegal drugs or endangered animals across their borders. Moving goods, animals, or people illegally across a border, without declaring them or seeking permission, or deliberately evading official inspection, constitutes smuggling. Controls on car liability insurance validity and other formalities may also take place.
A border may have been:
* Agreed by the countries on both sides
* Imposed by the country on one side
* Imposed by third parties, e.g. an international conference
* Inherited from a former state, colonial power or aristocratic territory
* Inherited from a former internal border, such as within the former Soviet Union
* Never formally defined.

In addition, a border may be a &quot;de facto&quot; military ceasefire line.
In much of Europe, controls on persons were abolished by the 1985 Schengen Agreement and subsequent European Union legislation. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the competence to pass laws on crossing internal and external borders within the European Union and the associated Schengen Area states (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein) lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the European Union, except where states have used a specific right to opt out (United Kingdom and Ireland, which maintain the Common Travel Area amongst themselves).

The United States has notably increased measures taken in border control on the Canada–United States border and the United States–Mexico border during its War on Terrorism (See Shantz 2010). One American writer has said that the US-Mexico border is probably &quot;the world&#x27;s longest boundary between a First World and Third World country&quot;.

Historic borders such as the Great Wall of China, the Maginot Line, and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall have played a great many roles and been marked in different ways. While the stone walls, the Great Wall of China and the Roman Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in Britain had military functions, the entirety of the Roman borders were very porous, which encouraged Roman economic activity with neighbors. On the other hand, a border like the Maginot Line was entirely military and was meant to prevent any access in what was to be World War II to France by its neighbor, Germany; Germany ended up going around the Maginot Line through Belgium just as it had done in World War I.

=== Border conflict ===
Border conflicts are disputes between territories that occur at the borders separating said territories. They occur when one party constructs identities or interests related to the border which are incompatible with the other party&#x27;s identities and interests. Border conflicts or the potential of such are the reason why many borders feature fortifications and zoning like no man&#x27;s lands, demilitarized zones, demarcation lines and buffer zones. Examples of border conflicts include skirmishes and wars, such as the 38th Parallel (between North and South Korea), Western Sahara conflict, and Kashmir region conflicts between India and Pakistan.

A border conflict can occur due to several reasons. Most commonly, territorial disputes can result in border conflicts, as it is the case with the Kashmir conflict.

== Border construction and crossings ==

 While many borders are based on specific natural landscape features, some borders have additional man-made infrastructure. Fencing is used for security reasons, mainly to prevent unauthorised activity between the borders, including the travelling and transport of humans and goods. In a state of increased tension, borders may also be heavily fortified, with defensive infrastructure being built. Crossings may be built into a border to allow for regulated crossing into such territory.

=== Crossings and transition ===

Even the most fortified borders reserve specific places to allow crossing. The many forms of borders have different ways of enabling and controlling passage.

=== Movement and permeability ===
Borders can have a significant impact on and function for movement. It can enable and stop movement, across as well as along borders.

The permeability of borders depends on its construction, availability of crossings, regulation and types or scope of activity. The permeability can vary, borders can be barriers for humans, but also for animal migration or types of pollution.

== Overlap and cooperation ==

Borders facilitate or block hybrids like border overlap and cooperation beyond mere encounter and exchange.

=== Cross-border regions ===
Macro-regional integration initiatives, such as the European Union and NAFTA, have spurred the establishment of cross-border regions. These are initiatives driven by local or regional authorities, aimed at dealing with local border-transcending problems such as transport and environmental degradation. Many cross-border regions are also active in encouraging intercultural communication and dialogue as well as cross-border economic development strategies. In Europe, the European Union provides financial support to cross-border regions via its Interreg programme. The Council of Europe has issued the Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation, providing a legal framework for cross-border co-operation even though it is in practice rarely used by Euroregions.

== Border studies ==
There has been a renaissance in the study of borders starting with the end of the 1990s, partially from the creation of a counter-narrative to the discourse about the world becoming a borderless and deterritorialized place, which has accompanied theories about globalization. Examples of recent initiatives are the Border Regions in Transition network of scholars, the International Boundaries Research Unit at the University of Durham, the Association for Borderlands Studies based in North America, the African Borderlands Research Network and the founding of smaller border research centres at Nijmegen and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

== Border art ==
Border art is a contemporary art practice rooted in the socio-political experience(s), such as of those on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, or &quot;frontera&quot;. Since its conception in the mid-1980s, this artistic practice has assisted in the development of questions surrounding homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin(s).

Border art as a conceptual artistic practice, however, opens up the possibility for artists to explore similar concerns of identity and national origin(s) but whose location is not specific to the U.S-Mexico border. A border can be a division, dividing groups of people and families. Borders can include but are not limited to language, culture, social and economic class, religion, and national identity. In addition to a division, a border can also conceive a borderland area that can create a cohesive community separate from the mainstream cultures and identities portrayed in the communities away from the borders, such as the Tijuana-San Diego border between Mexico and the United States.

Border art can be defined as an art that is created in reference to any number of physical or imagined boundaries. This art can but is not limited to social, political, physical, emotional and/or nationalist issues. Border art is not confined to one particular medium. Border art/artists often address the forced politicization of human bodies and physical land and the arbitrary, yet incredibly harmful, separations that are created by these borders and boundaries. These artists are often &quot;border crossers&quot; themselves. They may cross borders of traditional art-making (through performance, video, or a combination of mediums). They may at once be artists and activists, existing in multiple social roles at once. Many border artists defy easy classifications in their artistic practice and work.

<text>Satun (, is one of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Trang, Phatthalung, and Songkhla. To the south it borders Perlis of Malaysia.

==Toponymy==
The name Satun is a Thai version of its original Malay name, Setul (santol, or wild mangosteen tree). Setoi is the name of the province in Northern Malay dialect.

==Geography==
The province is on the Malay Peninsula, on the shore of the Andaman Sea. It is separated from Songkhla province by the Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range, and from Malaysia by the Nakawan Range. The total forest area is or 40.1 percent of provincial area.

The Ko Tarutao and Ko Phetra marine national parks are part of the province. Close to the border with Malaysia is the Thale Ban National Park, a big freshwater swamp area.

The three groups of offshore islands in the Andaman Sea form the Ko Sarai (Thai: เกาะสาหร่าย, pronounced [kɔ̀ʔ sǎːràːj]) subdistrict (&quot;tambon&quot;) of Mueang Satun District. It is composed of 3 island groups, totaling 243 km2 in area, had a population of 5,077 as of 2012. The biggest village is Ban Ko Sarai (sometimes called Ban Yaratot Yai), on the island with the same name of 13 km2, but the largest islands are Ko Tarutao (163 km2) closer to the mainland and the Ko Adang-Ko Rawi group (67 km2) further west. The population relies on fishing, agriculture and tourism.

===National parks===
There are three national parks, along with seventeen other national parks, make up region 5 (Nakhon Si Thammarat) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Tarutao National Park, 
* Mu Ko Phetra National Park, 
* Thale Ban National Park, 

==History==
In 1897 Satun became part of Monthon Syburi (now Kedah), which in 1909 was divided between British Empire and Siam as part of Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. While most of Kedah was ceded to Britain, Satun was awarded to Siam because it had a relatively large Thai population. Satun was then incorporated into Monthon Phuket. The monthon system was ended in 1933, and Satun province became a first-level subdivision of Thailand. Until 1916 Satun was a small Malay state known as Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara, closely associated to the Kedah Sultanate. After that date it was administered by a governor sent from Nakhon Si Thammarat.

The province was to have been the site of the Pak Bara Deep-seaport in La-ngu District.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows &quot;Phra Samut Thewa&quot; (समुद्र देवा &quot;Samudra Deva&quot;, &quot;God of the ocean&quot;) sitting on a rock in the sea, with the sunset behind. &quot;Phra Samut Thewa&quot; is a spirit who guards the sea. The rock is his divine vehicle. The sunset symbolizes the Andaman Sea, which lies to the west of the province.

The provincial tree is the Thai Rosewood or &quot;Pha-yungklaep&quot; (&quot;Dalbergia bariensis&quot;), and the provincial flower is the Snowy Orchid Tree (&quot;Bauhinia acuminata&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the ocellaris clownfish (&quot;Amphiprion ocellaris&quot;). The province&#x27;s motto is &quot;Peaceful, clean, and pure nature&quot;.

==Demographics==

Like Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, Satun is one of the four provinces of Thailand which have a Muslim majority: 76.77 percent are Muslim and 23.02 percent are Buddhists. Most of the Muslims are ethnic-Malays, though only 9.9 percent of the present-day population speaks Malay as their mother tongue due to the result of an effective language shift from Malay to Thai amongst its populace. The majority language in Satun province is Southern Thai, while the Malay dialect used in Satun is distinctly different from Patani Malay and is much closer to the Kedah dialect of Malay.

Since Satun had belonged to the Kedah Sultanate, which had a strong relationship for many centuries with both Ayutthaya and Siam under the Chakri dynasty, its Malay Muslims commonly intermarry with Thai Buddhists without serious religious hesitation. This custom has created a distinct social group known as &quot;samsam&quot;, meaning a mixed person. Most samsams, if not all, are Muslims.

Unlike the other Muslim majority provinces in Thailand, Satun does not have a history of political confrontation with the central power in Bangkok or of tension with the Buddhist population which makes up the majority of Thailand as a country. Malay Muslims in Satun are substantially assimilated and rarely sympathise with separatism from Thailand, in contrast to the Malay Muslims in Pattani, Narathiwat, and Yala.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Satun is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). These are further divided into 36 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 277 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).

Originally, the province was divided into two districts, Mambang and Thung Wa, and the minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) La-ngu. Due to the decline of pepper production in Thung Wa District, in 1930 the government made Thung Wa a minor district and instead declared La-ngu a district. In 1939 Mambang was renamed to Mueang Satun. Khuan Kalong was split off from Mueang district in 1969, from which in turn Tha Pae was split in 1976 and Manang in 1996. In 1973 Thung Wa regained district status. Khuan Don was established in 1975 by splitting it from Mueang district.

===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Satun Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 7 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Satun has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 6 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 34 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Economy==
According to a Satun Provincial Office spokesman, the province&#x27;s tourism income rose from two to 6.3 billion baht from 2010 to 2013, while tourist arrivals increased from 690,000 to 1.13 million.

The Department of Airports announced in October 2018 that it will conduct a feasibility study of an airport in the province. Six million baht is allocated for the study, to be completed in September 2019.

==Transportation==
Satun is connected to Langkawi, Malaysia by direct ferry service.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


== National parks==
* Mu Ko Phetra National Park is a marine national park in the Strait of Malacca off Thailand, covering mostly intact coastal line, open water, and about 30 islands of the southern part of Trang province and the northern part of Satun province. Established on 31 December 1984, it is the 49th national park and 14th marine national park of Thailand.


* Thale Ban National Park is a forested area south of the Banthat Mountains in southern Thailand, in the south of Satun province bordering Malaysia; it borders Taman Negeri Perlis park. The park was established on 27 October 1980. It covers an area of of Khuan Don and Mueang Satun districts.
* Tarutao National Park is Thailand&#x27;s second marine national park on 19 April 1974. The coastal Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park had been designated in 1966.

<text>A picnic is a meal taken outdoors (&quot;al fresco&quot;) as part of an excursion, especially in scenic surroundings, such as a park, lakeside, or other place affording an interesting view, or else in conjunction with a public event such as preceding an open-air theater performance, and usually in summer or spring. It is different from other meals because it requires free time to leave home.

Historically, in Europe, the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed to and enjoyed out-of-doors was essential to picnic from the early 19th century.

Picnickers like to sit on the ground on a rug or blanket. Picnics can be informal with throwaway plates or formal with silver cutlery and crystal wine glasses. Tables and chairs may be used, but this is less common.

Outdoor games or other forms of entertainment are common at large picnics. In public parks, a picnic area generally includes picnic tables and possibly built-in barbecue grills, water faucets (taps), garbage (rubbish) containers, restrooms (toilets) and gazebos (shelters).

Some picnics are a potluck, where each person contributes a dish for all to share. The food eaten is rarely hot, instead taking the form of sandwiches, finger food, fresh fruit, salad and cold meats. It can be accompanied by chilled wine, champagne or soft drinks.

==Etymology==

The word comes from the French &quot;pique-nique&quot;. However, it may also have been borrowed from the German word &quot;Picknick&quot;, which was itself borrowed from French.

The earliest English citation is in 1748, from Lord Chesterfield (Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield) who associates a &quot;pic-nic&quot; with card-playing, drinking, and conversation; around 1800, Cornelia Knight spelled the word as &quot;pique-nique&quot; in describing her travels in France.

According to some dictionaries, the French word &quot;pique-nique&quot; is based on the verb &quot;piquer&quot;, which means &#x27;pick&#x27;, &#x27;peck&#x27;, or &#x27;nab&#x27;, and the rhyming addition &quot;nique&quot;, which means &#x27;thing of little importance&#x27;, &#x27;bagatelle&#x27;, &#x27;trifle&#x27;. It first appears in 1649 in an anonymous broadside of burlesque verse called &quot;Les Charmans effects des barricades: ou l&#x27;Amitié durable de la compagnie des Frères bachiques de pique-nique : en vers burlesque (The Lasting Friendship of the Band of Brothers of the Bacchic Picnic).&quot; The satire describes Brother Pique-Nique who, during the civil war known as the Fronde, attacks his food with gusto instead of his enemies; Bacchus was the Roman god of wine, a reference to the drunken antics of the gourmand musketeers. By 1694 the word was listed in Gilles Ménage&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire étymologique, ou Origines de la langue françoise&quot; with the meaning of a shared meal, with each guest paying for himself, but with no reference to eating outdoors. It reached the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; in 1840 with the same meaning. In English, &quot;picnic&quot; only began to refer to an outdoor meal at the beginning of the 19th century.

==History==

The practice of an elegant meal eaten out-of-doors, rather than an agricultural worker&#x27;s mid-day meal in a field, was connected with respite from hunting from the Middle Ages; the excuse for the pleasurable outing of 1723 in François Lemoyne&#x27;s painting (&quot;illustration)&quot; is still offered in the context of a hunt. In it, a white cloth can be seen, and, on it, wine, bread, and roast chicken.

While these outdoors meals could be called picnics, there are, according to Levy, reasons not to do so. &#x27;The English&#x27;, he claims, &#x27;left the hunter&#x27;s meal unnamed until after 1806, when they began calling almost any alfresco meal a picnic&#x27;. The French, Levy goes on to say, &#x27;refrained from calling anything outdoors a pique-nique until the English virtually made the word their own, and only afterwards did they acknowledge that a picnic might be enjoyed outdoors instead of indoors&#x27;.

===Pic Nic Society===
The French Revolution popularized the picnic across the world. French aristocrats fled to other Western countries, bringing their picnicking traditions with them.

In 1802, a fashionable group of over 200 aristocratic Londoners formed the Pic Nic Society. The members were Francophiles, or may have been French, who flaunted their love for all things French when the wars with France lulled between 1801 and 1830. Food historian Polly Russell however suggests that the Pic Nic Society lasted until 1850. The group&#x27;s intent was to offer theatrical entertainments and lavish meals followed by gambling. Members met in hired rooms in Tottenham Street. There was no kitchen so all food had to be made elsewhere. Each member was expected to provide a share of the entertainment and of the refreshments, with no one particular host.

===Victorian feasts===
Mrs Beeton&#x27;s picnic menus (in her &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; of 1861) are &#x27;lavish and extravagant&#x27;, according to Claudia Roden. She lists Beeton&#x27;s bill of fare for forty persons in her own book &quot;Picnics and Other Outdoor Feasts&quot;:

:A joint of cold roast beef, a joint of cold boiled beef, 2 ribs of lamb, 2 shoulders of lamb, 4 roast fowls, 2 roast ducks, 1 ham, 1 tongue, 2 veal and ham pies, 2 pigeon pies, 6 medium sized lobsters, 1 piece of collared calveshead, 18 lettuces, 6 baskets of salad, 6 cucumbers. Stewed fruit well sweetened and put into glass bottles well corked, 3 or 4 dozen plain pastry biscuits to eat with the stewed fruit, 2 dozen fruit turnovers, 4 dozen cheese cakes, 2 cold cabinet puddings in moulds, a few jam puffs, 1 large cold Christmas pudding (this must be good), a few baskets of fresh fruit, 3 dozen plain biscuits, a piece of cheese, 6 lbs of butter (this of course includes the butter for tea), 4 quatern loaves of household bread, 3 dozen rolls, 6 loaves of tin bread (for tea), 2 plain plum cakes, 2 pound cakes, 2 sponge cakes, a tin of mixed biscuits, ½ lb of tea. Coffee is not suitable for a picnic being difficult to make.

===Political picnics===
The image of picnics as a peaceful social activity can be used for political protest. In this context, a picnic functions as a temporary occupation of significant public territory. A famous example is the Pan-European Picnic held on both sides of the Hungarian/Austrian border on 19 August 1989 as part of the struggle towards German reunification; this mass meal led indirectly to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

On Bastille Day 2000, as a Millennium celebration, France created &quot;l&#x27;incroyable pique-nique&quot; (the incredible picnic), which stretched 1000 km from the English Channel to the Mediterranean, along the &quot;Méridienne verte&quot;.

===Church picnics===
Various religious denominations host annual church picnics for their congregation and local community. These picnics traditionally take place from August to mid-October when church members and the community socialize over food, conversation and games. In 1937, the Congregational Church of New York hosted 2,000 for its 41st annual event. American psychologist and newspaper columnist Dr. George W. Crane once wrote that Christ held the first church picnic when he asked his disciples to feed the 5,000 who gathered to hear him speak.

==Types of contemporary picnic food==
Contemporary picnics for many people involve simple food. In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, Alan Davidson offers hard-boiled eggs, sandwiches and pieces of cold chicken as good examples. In America, food writer Walter Levy suggests that &#x27;a picnic menu might include cold fried chicken, devilled eggs, sandwiches, cakes and sweets, cold sodas, and hot coffee&#x27;.

Picnics are traditionally eaten at Glyndebourne Opera during the interval and Roden proposes a Champagne Menu, as made by the Argentinian pianist Alberto Portugheis: &quot;Mousse de Caviare&quot;, &quot;Chaudfroid de Canard&quot;, &quot;Tomatoes Farcies&quot; and &quot;Pêches aux fraises&quot; (caviare mousse, cold duck, stuffed tomatoes and peaches and strawberries).

== Activities ==

In the mid 19th century, picnic games were organised by charities in the US to raise funds. In the 1880s, companies started to sponsor such picnic events for publicity and to gain the favour of their employees. The black community was segregated at this time but to gain respectability, games such a baseball were organised by black politicians at picnics in municipal parks and fairgrounds.

Games played at a picnic may use the food which has been brought. Heavy food such as a watermelon may be used in a relay race which also serves the purpose of transport the food to the eating area. After it is consumed, the seed or stones of fruit like cherries may be used for a spitting contest game or marbles.

If a large crowd is expected for picnic because it is a community event then some organisation will be required. A schedule of events will be drawn up and events will be organised for different levels of ability and types of participant: men, women, adults and children. Handbills, notices and tickets may be used to publicise and administer the events.

==Cultural representations==
===Film===

* The 1955 film &quot;Picnic&quot;, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same title by William Inge, was a multiple Oscar winner. A picnic is expected in the film but the writer does not include it: &#x27;There is no picnic in Picnic&#x27;. The potato salad, bread and butter sandwiches and devilled eggs are left in the car as the characters Madge and Hal cannot resist each other&#x27;s charms and Hal says &#x27;We&#x27;re not goin&#x27; on no goddamn picnic&#x27;. The film has been remade twice for television, in 1986 and 2000.
* &quot;The Office Picnic&quot; (1972) is a dark comedy set in an Australian Public Service office. It was written and produced by filmmaker Tom Cowan, who became famous for his work on the series &quot;Survivor&quot;.
* In Peter Weir&#x27;s mystery film &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), three girls and one of their teachers on a school outing mysteriously disappear. The only one who is later found remembers almost nothing. It is based on a 1967 drama and mystery novel of the same title by Australian author Joan Lindsay. In 2018 it was remade for television.
* In &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot; (1993, titled &quot;Picknick on the Beach&quot; in the German version), nine Indian women of various ages flee from their everyday lives by taking a joint excursion to the British resort town of Blackpool. They eat, according to journalist Simran Hans &#x27;a flask of chai, a metal tiffin of poppadoms and sweaty samosas in plastic Tupperware&#x27;.

===Painting===
From the 1830s, Romantic American landscape paintings of spectacular scenery often included a group of picnickers in the foreground. An early American illustration of the picnic is Thomas Cole&#x27;s &quot;The Pic-Nic&quot; of 1846 (Brooklyn Museum of Art). In it, a guitarist serenades the genteel social group in the Hudson River Valley with the Catskills visible in the distance. Cole&#x27;s well-dressed young picnickers having finished their repast, served from splint baskets on blue-and-white china, stroll about in the woodland and boat on the lake.
*&quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; (&quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot;) by Édouard Manet depicts a picnic. The 1862 painting juxtaposes a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting.
*A more contemporary portrayal is &quot;Past Times&quot; by Kerry James Marshall, from 1997, which depicts a black family picnicking in front of a lake. Two radios laid on their gingham patterned picnic blanket emit the lyrics of The Temptations and Snoop Dogg, while figures in the background engage in other activities synonymous with affluent white-American suburban culture.

===Literature===

* Jane Austen is one of the first English novelists who names picnics. She has two outdoor picnics in the novel Emma (1816). One is in the strawberry garden at Donwell Abbey. Parties where guests would pick their own strawberries were popular in the early nineteenth century and Mrs Elton wearing a large bonnet and carrying a basket spoke at length about them. The second is at Box Hill in Surrey. This picnic turns out to be a sore disappointment, Frank Churchill said to Emma: &#x27;Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve...&#x27; The food is described in vague terms as a &#x27;cold collation&#x27;. While Jane Austen talked excessively about food in her private letters, she was less obliging in her novels. At both of these occasions, in Emma, when food is eaten outside it ends in &#x27;ruffled tempers and hurt feelings&#x27; according to food historian Maggie Lane.
* In Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem Audley Court (1838) the picnickers eat dark bread and cold game pie in aspic and drink cider while they sing and chat about their old love affairs.&quot;There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid&quot; &quot;A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,&quot; &quot;Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,&quot; &quot;And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,&quot; &quot;Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,&quot; &quot;Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks&quot; &quot;Imbedded and injellied; last, with these,&quot; &quot;A flask of cider from his father&#x27;s vats,&quot; &quot;Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and ate&quot; &quot;And talked old matters over; who was dead,&quot; &quot;Who married, who was like to be, and how.&quot;
* In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1870) a &#x27;potluck&#x27; meal is described &quot;For dinner we&#x27;ll have a tureen of the hottest and strongest soup available, and we&#x27;ll have the best made-dish that can be recommended, and we&#x27;ll have a joint (such as a haunch of mutton), and we&#x27;ll have a goose, or a turkey, or any little stuffed thing of that sort that may happen to be in the bill of fare - in short we&#x27;ll have whatever there is on hand.&#x27; But Dickens, Levy argues, &#x27;differentiates potluck and picnic&#x27; when he adds that &#x27;Miss Twinkleton (in her amateur state of existence) has contributed herself and a veal pie to a picnic&#x27;.
*&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1908), the classic children&#x27;s novel by Kenneth Grahame, begins with a much-quoted impromptu excursion; both the idyllic riverbank setting and the lavish provisions are Platonic ideals of the English country picnic. Rat is a well-organised host; a brief visit to his home is all he needs before he reappears &quot;staggering under a fat, wicker luncheon-basket&quot; which his friend Mole serves onto a tablecloth.
* In Fernando Arrabal&#x27;s one-act drama &quot;Picnic on the Battlefield (1959)&quot; the young and inexperienced soldier private Zepo is visited unexpectedly by his devoted parents. They arrive with a picnic basket, which they unpack &#x27;spreading sausage, hard-boiled eggs, ham, sandwiches, salad, cakes, and red wine on a cloth&#x27;. Zapo reminds them that &#x27;discipline and hand-grenades are what&#x27;s wanted in war, not visits&#x27; but they ignore him and invite an enemy soldier to join in their picnic. After wine and lacklustre conversation they start enthusiastically dancing to the pasodoble to the music of the phonograph they&#x27;ve brought with them. They are all killed by machine-gun fire. Levy recounts &#x27;The shocked audience sits watching stretcher-bearers remove the bodies, listening to a stuck phonograph needle repeat the pasodoble tune&#x27;.
* &quot;No Picnic on Mount Kenya: The Story of Three P.O.W.s&#x27; Escape to Adventure&quot; (1946), by Felice Benuzzi, is the true story of three Italian prisoners of war who, faced with years of tedium in a detention camp, decide to break out in order to climb Africa&#x27;s second-highest mountain. &quot;No expedition on the mountain was ever a picnic&quot; Vivienne de Watteville had written in her book &quot;Speak to the Earth&quot; (1935) about her 1929 visit to Mount Kenya. Benuzzi&#x27;s English title, perhaps suggested by this line of de Watteville&#x27;s, refers to the expression &#x27;It was no picnic&#x27;, meaning &#x27;It was hard going&#x27;, but with an ironic allusion to the climbers&#x27; meagre P.O.W. rations.
* The novel &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; (1972) by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, was the source for the film &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979) by Andrei Tarkovsky. The novel is about a mysterious &#x27;zone&#x27; filled with strange and often deadly extraterrestrial artefacts, which are theorized by some scientists to be the refuse from an alien &quot;picnic&quot; on Earth.

===Music===
* In 1906, the American composer John Walter Bratton wrote a musical piece originally titled &quot;The Teddy Bear Two Step&quot;. It became popular in a 1908 instrumental version renamed &#x27;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&#x27;, performed by the Arthur Pryor Band. The song regained prominence in 1932 when the Irish lyricist Jimmy Kennedy added words and it was recorded by the then popular Henry Hall (and his BBC Dance Orchestra) featuring Val Rosing (Gilbert Russell) as lead vocalist, which went on to sell a million copies. &#x27;The Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&#x27; resurfaced again in the late 1940s and early 1950s when it was used as the theme song for the &quot;Big Jon and Sparkie&quot; children&#x27;s radio show. This perennial favorite has appeared on many children&#x27;s recordings ever since, and is the theme song for the AHL&#x27;s Hershey Bears hockey club. lyrics and audio from the BBC
* &#x27;Stoned Soul Picnic&#x27;, by Laura Nyro (released in 1968), was also a major hit for the group The 5th Dimension.
*Roxette&#x27;s 1996 song &#x27;June Afternoon&#x27; depicts images of people having fun and eating in a park during a sunny warm June day.

<text>USS &quot;Sides&quot; (FFG-14) was an guided-missile frigate that served in the US Navy.

== History ==
The eighth ship in the class, it was named for Admiral John H. Sides (died 1978). Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California, on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, &quot;Sides&quot; was laid down on 7 August 1978, launched on 19 May 1979, and commissioned on 30 May 1981. &quot;Sides&quot; ship sponsor was Mrs. Joanne Sides Watson, daughter of Admiral Sides.

&quot;Sides&quot; escorted tankers through the Straits of Hormuz during the Tanker War and participated in Operation Praying Mantis, the retaliation for Iranian mining operations. &quot;Sides&quot; was also part of the Surface Action Group under when Iran Air 655 was shot down. &quot;Sides&quot; and her crew received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the time period 13 April 1988 to 25 July 1988. The following year, Commander David R. Carlson authored an article in &quot;U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings&quot; in which Carlson called into question Vincennes&#x27; self-defense justification for the use of force and wrote, &quot;Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down for no good reason.&quot; Capt. Will Rogers of &quot;Vincennes&quot; and David L. Dillon, speaking on behalf of the US Navy, challenged Carlson&#x27;s account of events.

&quot;Sides&quot; and her crew received Navy E Ribbons for the 18-month period, July 1983 to December 1984, and for the years 1995, 1999 and 2000.

&quot;Sides&quot; was decommissioned on 28 February 2003 and as of 2014 was laid up in reserve at Naval Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility Bremerton, Washington.

&quot;Sides&quot; was expected to join the Portuguese Navy in 2006, together with her sister ship , but the Portuguese Navy dropped the offer and chose two Dutch s instead. &quot;Sides&quot; was expected to join the Turkish Navy in the summer of 2008, together with her sister ship &quot;George Philip&quot;, but the Turkish Navy dropped the offer.

<text>In mathematics, a reciprocity law is a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity to arbitrary monic irreducible polynomials formula_1 with integer coefficients. Recall that first reciprocity law, quadratic reciprocity, determines when an irreducible polynomial formula_2 splits into linear terms when reduced mod formula_3. That is, it determines for which prime numbers the relationformula_4holds. For a general reciprocity lawpg 3, it is defined as the rule determining which primes formula_3 the polynomial formula_6 splits into linear factors, denoted formula_7.

There are several different ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol (&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;) generalizing the quadratic reciprocity symbol, that describes when a prime number is an &quot;n&quot;th power residue modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;) and (&quot;q&quot;/&quot;p&quot;). Hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over &quot;p&quot; of Hilbert norm residue symbols (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;/&quot;p&quot;), taking values in roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin reformulated the reciprocity laws as a statement that the Artin symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup. Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see.

The name reciprocity law was coined by Legendre in his 1785 publication &quot;Recherches d&#x27;analyse indéterminée&quot;, because odd primes &quot;reciprocate&quot; or not in the sense of quadratic reciprocity stated below according to their residue classes formula_8. This reciprocating behavior does not generalize well, the equivalent splitting behavior does. The name reciprocity law is still used in the more general context of splittings.

==Quadratic reciprocity==

In terms of the Legendre symbol, the law of quadratic reciprocity states 
 for positive odd primes formula_9 we have formula_10

Using the definition of the Legendre symbol this is equivalent to a more elementary statement about equations.
 For positive odd primes formula_9 the solubility of formula_12 for formula_13 determines the solubility of formula_14 for formula_15 and vice versa by the comparatively simple criterion whether formula_16 is formula_17 or formula_18.

By the factor theorem and the behavior of degrees in factorizations the solubility of such quadratic congruence equations is equivalent to the splitting of associated quadratic polynomials over a residue ring into linear factors. In this terminology the law of quadratic reciprocity is stated as follows. 
 For positive odd primes formula_9 the splitting of the polynomial formula_20 in formula_21-residues determines the splitting of the polynomial formula_22 in formula_23-residues and vice versa through the quantity formula_24.

This establishes the bridge from the name giving &quot;reciprocating&quot; behavior of primes introduced by Legendre to the &quot;splitting&quot; behavior of polynomials used in the generalizations.

==Cubic reciprocity==

The law of cubic reciprocity for Eisenstein integers states that if α and β are primary (primes congruent to 2 mod 3) then
:formula_25

==Quartic reciprocity==

In terms of the quartic residue symbol, the law of quartic reciprocity for Gaussian integers states that if π and θ are primary (congruent to 1 mod (1+&quot;i&quot;)3) Gaussian primes then 
:formula_26

==Octic reciprocity==
==Eisenstein reciprocity==

Suppose that ζ is an formula_27th root of unity for some odd prime formula_27. 
The power character is the power of ζ such that
:formula_29
for any prime ideal formula_30 of Z[ζ]. It is extended to other ideals by multiplicativity.
The Eisenstein reciprocity law states that 
:formula_31
for &quot;a&quot; any rational integer coprime to formula_27 and α any element of Z[ζ] that is coprime to &quot;a&quot; and formula_27 and congruent to a rational integer modulo (1–ζ)2.

==Kummer reciprocity==
Suppose that ζ is an &quot;l&quot;th root of unity for some odd regular prime &quot;l&quot;. Since &quot;l&quot; is regular, we can extend the symbol {} to ideals in a unique way such that
:formula_34 where &quot;n&quot; is some integer prime to &quot;l&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is principal. 
The Kummer reciprocity law states that 
:formula_35
for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; any distinct prime ideals of Z[ζ] other than (1–ζ).

==Hilbert reciprocity==

In terms of the Hilbert symbol, Hilbert&#x27;s reciprocity law for an algebraic number field states that
:formula_36 
where the product is over all finite and infinite places.
Over the rational numbers this is equivalent to the law of quadratic reciprocity. To see this take &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; to be distinct odd primes. 
Then Hilbert&#x27;s law becomes 
formula_37
But (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)&quot;p&quot; is equal to the Legendre symbol, (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)∞ is 1 if one of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; is positive and –1 otherwise, and (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)2 is (–1)(&quot;p&quot;–1)(&quot;q&quot;–1)/4. So for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; positive odd primes Hilbert&#x27;s law is the law of quadratic reciprocity.

==Artin reciprocity==

In the language of ideles, the Artin reciprocity law for a finite extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; states that the Artin map from the idele class group &quot;C&quot;&quot;K&quot; to the abelianization Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;)ab of the Galois group vanishes on &quot;N&quot;&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;(&quot;C&quot;&quot;L&quot;), and induces an isomorphism
: formula_38

Although it is not immediately obvious, the Artin reciprocity law easily implies all the previously discovered reciprocity laws, by applying it to suitable extensions &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;. 
For example, in the special case when &quot;K&quot; contains the &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity and &quot;L&quot;=&quot;K&quot;[&quot;a&quot;1/&quot;n&quot;] is a Kummer extension of &quot;K&quot;, the fact that the Artin map vanishes on &quot;N&quot;&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;(&quot;C&quot;&quot;L&quot;) implies Hilbert&#x27;s reciprocity law for the Hilbert symbol.

==Local reciprocity==
Hasse introduced a local analogue of the Artin reciprocity law, called the local reciprocity law. One form of it states that for a finite abelian extension of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; of local fields, the Artin map is an isomorphism 
from formula_39 onto the Galois group formula_40.

==Explicit reciprocity laws==

In order to get a classical style reciprocity law from the Hilbert reciprocity law Π(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)&quot;p&quot;=1, one needs to know the values of (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)&quot;p&quot; for &quot;p&quot; dividing &quot;n&quot;. Explicit formulas for this are sometimes called explicit reciprocity laws.

==Power reciprocity laws==

A &quot;power reciprocity law&quot; may be formulated as an analogue of the law of quadratic reciprocity in terms of the Hilbert symbols as

:formula_41

==Rational reciprocity laws==
A rational reciprocity law is one stated in terms of rational integers without the use of roots of unity.

==Scholz&#x27;s reciprocity law==
==Shimura reciprocity==
==Weil reciprocity law==
==Langlands reciprocity==

The Langlands program includes several conjectures for general reductive algebraic groups, which for the special of the group GL1 imply the Artin reciprocity law.

==Yamamoto&#x27;s reciprocity law==

Yamamoto&#x27;s reciprocity law is a reciprocity law related to class numbers of quadratic number fields.

<text>USS &quot;Estocin&quot; (FFG-15), ninth ship of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class of guided-missile frigates, was named for Captain Michael John Estocin (1931–1967). Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, &quot;Estocin&quot; was laid down on 2 April 1979, launched on 3 November 1979, and commissioned on 10 January 1981.

&quot;Estocin&quot; (FFG-15) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy. The ship&#x27;s motto, listed on her crest, was &quot;Courage, Honor, Tenacity&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Estocin&quot; was sponsored by Michael John Estocin&#x27;s widow, Mrs Quay Marie (Hampton) Estocin. Their three daughters served as maids of honor at the ceremonial launching and christening.

===1980s===
After her commissioning, &quot;Estocin&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron Eight, homeported in Mayport, Florida. While there, she made deployments to the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and participated in Special Operations off the Central American coast.

&quot;Estocin&quot; and her crew were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations near Lebanon between 10 October and 10 November 1982. See also Multinational Force in Lebanon.
15 October 1985 &quot;Estocin&quot; ran aground near Key West, Florida.

Throughout 1986, &quot;Estocin&quot; served as the Navy&#x27;s testbed for the Mk-92 Fire Control System improvement project (CORT). The Mk-92 &quot;CORT&quot; program was a CNO Priority-1 Project, one of the only four in the entire Navy at that time. These tests had &quot;Estocin&quot; tracking and engaging a variety of surface and air targets. Fifteen SM-1 medium range missiles and nearly 1000 rounds of 76mm ammunition were fired in the course of the test cycle. By the end of 1986, &quot;Estocin&quot; had logged nearly 15,000 underway miles in support of this project. &quot;Estocin&quot; and her crew were awarded a Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation for operations between January and November, 1986.

On 1 October 1986, &quot;Estocin&quot; officially became part of the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) reported to Naval Surface Warfare Group Four, homeported in Philadelphia, PA. Upon joining the NRF, &quot;Estocin&quot; operated primarily in the western Atlantic in support of Naval Reserve Training (NRT) and active fleet commitments. She logged frequent underway weekends devoted entirely to Selected Reserve crew training, as well as periodic underway periods of 2-week duration to enable reservists to complete their active duty training requirements. These operations took &quot;Estocin&quot; as far north as Nova Scotia and south to the Caribbean.

&quot;Estocin&quot; and her crew were awarded a United States Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon for operations July to September, 1989.

===1990s===
&quot;Estocin&quot; was chosen to conduct a Great Lakes Cruise in 1991 in support of U.S. Navy recruiting efforts and to promote public awareness in America&#x27;s heartland, through port calls to U.S. and Canadian cities on the Great Lakes. In the fall of 1991 and the spring of 1992, &quot;Estocin&quot; participated in Canadian Fleet Operations conducted with U.S. Navy and Canadian Maritime Command units in the area south of Nova Scotia.

&quot;Estocin&quot; and her crew were awarded a Battle Effectiveness Award for operations in 1992.

On 17 August 1992, &quot;Estocin&quot; changed homeport to Newport, RI. &quot;Estocin&quot; completed Maritime Interdiction Operations in the Caribbean and in December 1993 operated off the coast of Haiti during Operation Support Democracy. In January 1994, &quot;Estocin&quot; again changed her homeport moving to Naval Base, Norfolk, VA. &quot;Estocin&quot; was again selected for a Great Lakes Cruise in the summer of 1994. Upon completion of this cruise, she underwent a four-month drydock period to inspect and overhaul numerous shipboard systems. After completion of this drydocking, &quot;Estocin&quot; was sent in the fall of 1995 to the Caribbean in support of Counter Drug Operations. During this cruise, &quot;Estocin&quot; transited the Panama Canal to conduct Counter Drug Operations in the eastern Pacific as well.
In 1996, after completing a work-up cycle, which included re-certification of her propulsion plant and cruise missile tactical qualification, &quot;Estocin&quot; deployed with Destroyer Squadron Eighteen in support of Operation Northern Light-Bright Horizon 96. During this fast-paced month and a half commitment, &quot;Estocin&quot; participated in a variety of maneuvering and training exercises with over 53 ships and submarines from 13 European nations. Upon her return to Norfolk, &quot;Estocin&quot; entered an availability period to prepare ship&#x27;s systems for her next commitment, Joint Task Force Exercise 97-1 (JTFEX 97–1). During this exercise &quot;Estocin&quot; was the flagship for the Opposing Forces (OPFOR), whose mission was to train the deploying carrier battle group. Although composed of U.S. ships, the OPFOR simulated a variety of patrol boats found throughout the world. Successfully training the battle group, &quot;Estocin&quot; prepared for her next deployment.

Assigned to Cruiser Destroyer Group Eight, &quot;Estocin&quot; deployed for Baltic Operations 97 (BALTOPS 97) in May 1997. The deployment entailed at-sea operations with ships from NATO countries as well as non-NATO countries such as Russia, Poland and Lithuania. BALTOPS 97 also included goodwill visits to former Eastern-Bloc nations. During this deployment, &quot;Estocin&quot; had the unique opportunity to become the first U.S. warship to visit two Russian ports in the same deployment, with stops in Baltiysk and Severomorsk, Russia. In addition, &quot;Estocin&quot; had the distinct privilege of hosting the Admirals of the Russian Baltic and Northern Fleets during her port calls.

January 1999 found &quot;Estocin&quot; deploying for the Caribbean. Once again in support of Counter Drug Operations, &quot;Estocin&quot; set the standard in curbing the flow of drugs into the United States. After four and a half months in the Caribbean, including a cocaine seizure of over , &quot;Estocin&quot; returned home on 15 May.

&quot;Estocin&quot; was underway once again at the end of June 1999 to participate in INDEX 99-2 with the Battle Group. During this exercise, &quot;Estocin&quot; simulated Opposing Forces during Harpoon, Anti Air Warfare, and Anti Submarine Warfare exercises. &quot;Estocin&quot; proved her battle readiness in all areas as she conducted multiple PACFIRES with her 76mm gun, launched two Mk 46 Torpedoes and fired three successful SM-1 engagements. After achieving her best battle readiness condition in over four years, &quot;Estocin&quot; returned to Norfolk in July to conduct a nine-week Restricted Availability (RAV).

After this maintenance period and successful training cycle workups, &quot;Estocin&quot; sailed late November 1999 to support preparing the Battle Group for deployment as an Opposition Force in JTFEX 00-1. She also participated in INDEX 99-3, which allowed training in all warfare areas for the crew. At the completion of the JTFEX, &quot;Estocin&quot; was chosen by Commander, Second Fleet to perform a bilateral exercise with two French Navy ships, the and frigate . This exercise provided valuable training for the midshipmen embarked on &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; and helped to further strengthen the strong Naval ties with this NATO ally.

===2000s and decommissioning===
As of 2000, &quot;Estocin&quot; was in homeport, Norfolk, VA, preparing for upcoming exercises including: a group sail under the command of Commander, Destroyer Squadron Fourteen; a UNITAS exercise with ships from the Venezuelan, Colombian, and U.S. navies; and participation with Brazilian and other nation naval units in honor of the 500th anniversary of the founding of Brazil in April 2000.

&quot;Estocin&quot; and her crew were awarded a Battle Effectiveness Award for operations in 2000.

On 14 May 2001, &quot;Estocin&quot; returned to homeport in Norfolk, Virginia after a five-month deployment to the Caribbean, including again Operation UNITAS.

&quot;Estocin&quot; and swapped crews in late February 2002 (with one junior officer deemed crucial to Estocin&#x27;s operation to transfer that remained with that Estocin through the crew swap). Both frigates were scheduled to decommission in 2002, but following 11 September 2001, Navy leadership decided it might be advantageous to retain one of the two short hulled frigates. &quot;Estocin&quot; had already reduced crew size nearly 40% preparing to decommission in support of a planned ship transfer to the Republic of Turkey that had been already approved by Congress. Yet, she was the more recently modernized of the two frigates which was why the Republic of Turkey was interested in that Foreign Military Sale (FMS). The U.S. changed the FMS offer to Turkey with the Former &quot;Samuel Eliot Morison&quot; at a reduced price to the original FMS offer of &quot;Estocin&quot;. Former &quot;Samuel Eliot Morison&quot; sailors were then transferred to serve on &quot;Estocin&quot; and their ship was decommissioned 11 April 2002 with the former &quot;Estocin&quot; skeleton crew. &quot;Estocin&quot; was decommissioned at Mayport and stricken a year later on 3 April 2003. She was the last short-hulled FFG operational with the US Navy.

==TCG &quot;Göksu&quot; (F 497)== 

On 3 April 2003, &quot;Estocin&quot; was decommissioned, stricken from the Navy list and transferred to Turkey as that nation&#x27;s TCG &quot;Göksu&quot; (F 497). As of 2022, she is still in active service.

<text>Jean de Brébeuf () (25 March 1593 16 March 1649) was a French Jesuit missionary who travelled to New France (Canada) in 1625. There he worked primarily with the Huron for the rest of his life, except for a few years in France from 1629 to 1633. He learned their language and customs, writing extensively about each to aid other missionaries.

In 1649, Brébeuf and another missionary were captured when an Iroquois raid took over a Huron village (referred to in French as St. Louis). Together with Huron captives, the missionaries were ritually tortured and killed on 16 March 1649. Afterwards, his heart was eaten by Iroquois tribesmen. Brébeuf was beatified in 1925 and with eight Jesuit missionaries was canonized in the Catholic Church in 1930.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Brébeuf was born 25 March 1593 in Condé-sur-Vire, Normandy, France (He was the uncle of poet Georges de Brébeuf.). He joined the Society of Jesus in 1617 at the age of 24, spending the next two years under the direction of Lancelot Marin. Between 1619 and 1621, he was a teacher at the college of Rouen. Brébeuf was nearly expelled from the Society when he contracted tuberculosis in 1620—a severe and usually fatal illness that prevented his studying and teaching for the traditional periods.

His record as a student was not particularly distinguished, but Brébeuf was already beginning to show an aptitude for languages. Later in New France, he would teach Native American languages to missionaries and French traders. Brébeuf was ordained as a priest at Pontoise Cathedral in February 1622.

===Missionary===

After three years as Steward at the College of Rouen, Brébeuf was chosen by the Provincial of France, Father Pierre Coton, to embark on the missions to New France.

In June 1625, Brébeuf arrived in Québec with Fathers Charles Lalemant and Énemond Massé, together with the lay brothers Francois Charton and Gilbert Burel. He worked at the Sainte-Marie among the Hurons. For about five months Brébeuf lived with a tribe of Montagnais, who spoke an Algonquian language. He was later assigned in 1626 to the Huron with Father Anne Nouée. From then on Brébeuf worked mostly as a missionary to the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. Brébeuf briefly took up residence with the Bear Tribe at Toanché, but met with no success in trying to convert them to Catholicism. He was summoned to Québec because of the danger to which the entire colony was then exposed by the English. He reached Québec on 17 July 1628 after an absence of two years. On 19 July 1629, Samuel de Champlain surrendered, and the missionaries returned to France.

In Rouen, Brébeuf served as a preacher and confessor, taking his final Jesuit vows in 1630. Between 1631 and 1633, Brébeuf worked at the College of Eu, Seine-Maritime in northern France as a steward, minister and confessor. He returned to New France in 1633, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life.

Along with Antoine Daniel and Ambroise Davost, Brébeuf chose &quot;Ihonatiria&quot; (Saint-Joseph I) as the centre for missionary activity with the Huron. At the time, the Huron suffered epidemics of new Eurasian diseases contracted from the Europeans. Their death rates were high, as they had no immunity to the diseases long endemic in Europe. They, with our hindsight, rightly blamed the Europeans for the deaths, with none of the parties understanding the causes.

Called &quot;Échon&quot; by the Hurons, Brébeuf was personally involved with teaching. His lengthy conversations with Huron friends left him with a good knowledge of their culture and spirituality. He learned their language and taught it to other missionaries and colonists. Fellow Jesuits such as Paul Ragueneau describe his ease and adaptability to the Huron way of life.

His efforts to develop a complete ethnographic record of the Huron has been described as &quot;the longest and most ambitious piece of ethnographic description in all &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot;&quot;. Brébeuf tried to find parallels between the Huron religion and Christianity, so as to facilitate the conversion of the Huron to the European religion. Brébeuf was known by the Huron for his apparent shamanistic skills, especially in rainmaking. Despite his efforts to learn their ways, he considered Huron spiritual beliefs to be undeveloped and &quot;foolish delusions&quot;; he was determined to convert them to Christianity. Brébeuf did not enjoy universal popularity with the Huron, as many believed he was a sorcerer. By 1640, nearly half the Huron had died of smallpox and the losses disrupted their society. Many children and elders died. With their loved ones dying before their eyes, many Huron began to listen to the words of Jesuit missionaries who, unaffected by the disease, appeared to be men of great power.

Brébeuf&#x27;s progress as a missionary in achieving conversions was slow. Not until 1635 did some Huron agree to be baptized as Christians. He claimed to have made 14 converts as of 1635 and, by the next year, he claimed 86. He wrote a detailed account in 1636 of The Huron Feast of the Dead, a mass reburial of remains of loved ones after a community moved the location of its village. It was accompanied by elaborate rituals and gift-giving.

In 1638, Brébeuf turned over the direction of the mission at Saint-Joseph I to Jérôme Lalemant; he was called to become Superior at his newly founded Saint-Joseph II. In 1640, after an unsuccessful mission into Neutral Nation territory, Brébeuf broke his collarbone. He was sent to Québec to recover and worked there as a mission procurator. He taught the Huron, acting as confessor and advisor to the Ursulines and Religious Hospitallers. On Sundays and feast days, he preached to French colonists.

Brébeuf is credited with composing the &quot;Huron Carol&quot;, Canada&#x27;s oldest Christmas song, written around 1642. He wrote the lyrics in the native language of the Huron/Wendat people. The song&#x27;s melody is based on a traditional French folk song, &quot;Une Jeune Pucelle&quot; (A Young Maid).

===Linguistic work===
The educational rigour of the Jesuit seminaries prepared missionaries to acquire native languages. But, as they had learned the classical and Romance languages, they likely had difficulty with the very different conventions of the New World indigenous languages. Brébeuf&#x27;s study of the languages was also shaped by his religious training. Current Catholic theology tried to reconcile knowledge of world languages with accounts in the Bible of the tower of Babel, as this was the basis of European history. This influence can be seen in his discussion of language in his accounts collected in &quot;The Jesuit Relations.&quot;

Jean de Brébeuf&#x27;s remarkable facility with language was one of the reasons he was chosen for the Huron mission in 1626. He is distinguished for his commitment to learning the Huron (Wyandot) language. People with a strong positive attitude towards the language often learn the language much more easily. Brébeuf was widely acknowledged to have best mastered the Native oratory style, which used metaphor, circumlocution and repetition. Learning the language was still onerous, and he wrote to warn other missionaries of the difficulties.

To explain the low number of converts, Brébeuf noted that missionaries first had to master the Huron language. His commitment to this work demonstrates he understood that mutual intelligibility was vital for communicating complex and abstract religious ideas. He believed learning native languages was imperative for the Jesuit missions, but noted that it was so difficult a task that it consumed most of the priest&#x27;s time. Brébeuf felt his primary goal in his early years in New France was to learn the language.

With increasing proficiency in the Wyandot language, Brébeuf became optimistic about advancing his missionary goals. By understanding Huron religious beliefs and communicating Christian fundamentals, he could secure converts to Christianity. He realized the people would not give up all their traditional beliefs.

Brébeuf worked tirelessly to record his findings for the benefit of other missionaries. He built on the work of Recollects priests but significantly advanced the study, particularly in his representations of sounds. He discovered and reported the feature of compound words in Huron, which may have been his major linguistic contribution. This breakthrough had enormous consequences for further study, becoming the foundation for all subsequent Jesuit linguistic work.

He translated Ledesma&#x27;s catechism from French into Huron, and arranged to have it printed. It was the first printed text in that language (with French orthography). He also compiled a dictionary of Huron words, emphasizing translation of religious phrases such as from prayers and the Bible.

===Death===

Brébeuf was killed at St. Ignace in Huronia on 16 March 1649. He had been taken captive with Gabriel Lalemant when the Iroquois destroyed the Huron mission village at Saint-Louis. The Iroquois took the priests to the occupied village of Taenhatenteron (also known as St. Ignace), where they subjected the missionaries and native converts to ritual torture before killing them. The Iroquois then cannibalized his body.

Three priests had been killed in Mohawk country at Ossernenon in 1642 and 1646. Antoine Daniel had been killed in a similar Iroquois raid in 1648. Charles Garnier was killed by Iroquois in December 1649 in a Petun (Tobacco People) village, and Noel Chabanel was also martyred that year in the conflict between the Mohawk and other tribes. The Jesuits considered the priests&#x27; martyrdom as proof that the mission to the Native Americans was blessed by God and would be successful.

Throughout the torture, Brébeuf was reported to have been more concerned for the fate of the other Jesuits and of the captive Native converts than for himself. As part of the ritual, the Iroquois drank his blood and ate his heart, as they wanted to absorb Brébeuf&#x27;s courage in enduring the pain. The Iroquois mocked baptism by pouring boiling water over his head. Then they cannibalized him.
The Jesuits Christophe Regnault and Paul Ragueneau provided the two accounts of the deaths of Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalemant. According to Regnault, they learned of the tortures and deaths from Huron refugee witnesses who had escaped from Saint-Ignace. Regnault went to see the bodies to verify the accounts, and his superior Ragueneau&#x27;s account was based on his report. The main accounts of Brébeuf&#x27;s death come from &quot;The Jesuit Relations.&quot; Jesuit accounts of his torture emphasize his stoic nature and acceptance, claiming that he suffered silently without complaining.

Potential martyrdom was a central component of the Jesuit missionary identity. Missionaries going to Canada knew they were at risk from harsh conditions, as well as from confronting alien cultures. They expected to die in the name of God; they believed the missionary life and its risks were a chance to save converts and be saved.

===Relics, beatification and canonization===

Fathers Brébeuf and Lalement were recovered and buried together in a Sainte Marie cemetery. Brébeuf&#x27;s relics later became important religious objects within Catholic New France. Historian Allan Greer notes that &quot;his death seemed to fit the profile of a perfect martyr&#x27;s end&quot; and was preceded by what were considered religious signs pointing to correspondences with the Passion of Christ, which added to the significance of Brébeuf. On 21 March 1649, Jesuit inspectors found the bodies of Brébeuf and Lalement. In the late spring of 1649, Christophe Regnault prepared the skeletal remains of Brébeuf and Lalemant for transportation to Québec for safekeeping. Regnault boiled away the remaining flesh and reburied it in the mission church, scraped the bones and dried them in an oven, wrapped each relic in separate silk, deposited them in two small chests, and sent them to Québec.

Brébeuf&#x27;s family later donated his skull in a silver reliquary to the Catholic church orders in Québec. It was held by the women of the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec and the Ursuline convent from 1650 until 1925 when the relics were moved to the Québec Seminary for a ceremony to celebrate Brébeuf&#x27;s beatification. According to Catholic belief, these relics provide physical access to the influence of the saint of whom they are a part.

In 1652 Paul Raguenau went through the &quot;Relations&quot; and pulled out material relating to the martyrs of New France. He formalized this material in a document, to be used as the foundation of canonization proceedings, entitled &quot;Memoires touchant la mort et les vertus (des Pères Jesuits),&quot; or the &quot;Manuscript of 1652.&quot; The religious communities in New France considered the Jesuit martyrs as imitators of previous saints in the Catholic Church. In this sense, Brébeuf in particular, and others like him, reinforced the notion that &quot;...Canada was a land of saints&quot;.

Catherine de Saint-Augustin said that Brébeuf appeared to her in a vision at the Québec Hôtel-Dieu while she was in a state of &quot;mystical ecstasy&quot;, and he acted as her spiritual advisor. According to one account, Catherine de Saint-Augustin ground up part of Brébeuf&#x27;s relic bone and gave it in a drink to a heretical and mortally ill man. It is said that the man was cured of his disease. In another instance, in 1660–61, a possessed woman was exorcised by the aid of one of Brébeuf&#x27;s ribs, again while under the care of Catherine de Saint-Augustin. The exact circumstances of this event are disputed. Brébeuf&#x27;s relics were also used by nuns who were treating wounded Huguenot (Protestant) soldiers, and they &quot;reported that his assistance [bone slivers put in soldiers&#x27; drinks] helped rescue these patients from heresy&quot;.

Jean de Brébeuf was canonized by Pope Pius XI on 29 June 1930, and proclaimed one of the patron saints of Canada by Pope Pius XII on 16 October 1940. A contemporary newspaper account of the canonization declares: &quot;Brébeuf, the &#x27;Ajax of the mission&#x27;, stands out among them [others made saints with him] because of his giant frame, a man of noble birth, of vigorous passions tamed by religion,&quot; describing both the man and his defining drive according to formal terms of hagiography.

The Jesuits of Canada and the United States announced a tour of Brébeuf&#x27;s relics throughout both countries in 2024.

===Modern era===

It is said that the modern name of the Native North American sport of lacrosse was first coined by Brébeuf who thought that the sticks used in the game reminded him of a bishop&#x27;s crosier (&quot;crosse&quot; in French, and with the feminine definite article, &quot;la crosse&quot;).

He is buried in the Church of St. Joseph at the reconstructed Jesuit mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons across Highway 12 from the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine Catholic Church near Midland, Ontario. A plaque near the grave of Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalemant was unearthed during excavations at Ste Marie in 1954. The letters read &quot;P. Jean de Brébeuf /brusle par les Iroquois /le 17 de mars l&#x27;an/1649&quot; (Father Jean de Brébeuf, burned by the Iroquois, 17 March 1649).

In September 1984, Pope John Paul II prayed over Brébeuf&#x27;s skull before fully joining in an outdoor ecumenical service on the grounds of the nearby Martyrs&#x27; Shrine. The service was attended by an estimated 75,000 and mixed pre-Christian first-nation ritual with Catholic liturgy.

Numerous schools are named in his honour:

* St. Jean Brebeuf School in Calgary, Alberta
* St. John Brebeuf Regional Secondary School in Abbotsford, British Columbia.
* St. John Brebeuf School in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which is part of the St. John Brebeuf Catholic Parish

There is the Église St-Jean de Brebeuf in Sudbury, Ontario, and a St. John Brebeuf Catholic Parish in Niles, Illinois, USA. There is also a unit at Camp Ondessonk in the Shawnee National Forest named after Jean de Brébeuf. The Catholic camp is named for all of the North American Martyrs and those who helped them.

The parish municipality of Brébeuf, Quebec, is named after him, as is rue de Brébeuf on the Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal. Parc Brébeuf in the Hull region of Gatineau, Quebec is named in his honour and features a statue.

The character of Christophe in &quot;The Orenda&quot;, a 2013 novel by Joseph Boyden, is based on Jean de Brebeuf. The novel won the 2014 Canada Reads competition, a reality show with elimination-style voting on CBC Radio.

Jean de Brébeuf is the subject of &quot;Brébeuf and his Brethren&quot;, a blank-verse epic poem by the Canadian poet E. J. Pratt, FRSC, for which Pratt was awarded one of his three Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Poetry in 1940.

<text>The Canadian Grand Prix () is an annual motor racing event held since 1961. It has been part of the Formula One World Championship since 1967. It was first staged at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, as a sports car event, before alternating between Mosport and Circuit Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, after Formula One took over the event. After 1971, safety concerns led to the Grand Prix moving permanently to Mosport. In 1978, after similar safety concerns with Mosport, the Canadian Grand Prix moved to its current home at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec.

In 2005, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most watched Formula One Grand Prix in the world. The race was also the third most watched sporting event worldwide, behind the first place Super Bowl XXXIX and that year’s UEFA Champions League Final.

The 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the cancellation of the 2021 Canadian Grand Prix, the contract was extended to 2031. The Canadian Grand Prix returned to the calendar in the season.

==History==
The early Canadian Grand Prix was one of the premier events of the new Canadian Sports Car Championship, a series which had been created alongside the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park near Toronto in 1961. Mosport Park (which is still in its original layout configuration) was a spectacular and challenging circuit which had many ups and downs; the circuit was popular with drivers. Several international sports car as well as Formula One drivers participated in the event. For the first five years, the event would be won by drivers with either prior Formula One experience, or would enter the championship after winning the Canadian Grand Prix. In 1966 the Canadian-American Challenge Cup ran the event, with American Mark Donohue winning. Formula One took over the following year, although the CSCC and Can-Am series continued to compete at Mosport in their own events.

===Formula One===
====Mosport Park and Mont-Tremblant====
The event was run as part of the Formula One world championship first in 1967; Mosport Park was selected as the venue for the event. The Ontario circuit alternated with the Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, where the Canadian Grand Prix was held in 1968 and 1970. Mont-Tremblant, located hours northwest of Montreal, was much like Mosport Park in that it was a spectacular circuit which had significant elevation change and was very challenging. The first championship race was held between the German and Italian rounds on 27 August; it was won by Jack Brabham with his New Zealander teammate Denny Hulme completing a Brabham 1–2.

The 1968 event, which was moved to late September so it could be paired with the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, saw the unlucky New Zealander Chris Amon lead from the start until 17 laps from the end of the 90 lap distance when his gearbox broke; the McLaren team finished 1–2 with Amon&#x27;s countrymen Hulme and Bruce McLaren taking top honours.

Following the 1968 season, a group led by John Bassett and race sponsor Imperial Tobacco developed a proposal to move both the Grand Prix and Mosport&#x27;s Telegram Trophy IndyCar race to a new street circuit in Toronto along Lake Shore Boulevard and through Exhibition Place with the start/finish line and pits to be located inside Exhibition Stadium. Bassett dropped the idea just as the bill was going through third reading before Toronto city council. The idea to move the race to an urban location would return a decade later.

The 1969 event at Mosport Park saw Briton Jackie Stewart climb up from 4th to take the lead, but Jacky Ickx was coming up fast, and Stewart and Ickx battled until lap 33, when they came to lap privateer Al Pease for the fourth time, Ickx attempted to pass Stewart, and the two cars collided. Stewart was unable to get his Matra going, but Ickx did get his Brabham going, and held onto the lead until the checkered flag. An angry Stewart complained to his boss Ken Tyrrell about Pease, who complained to the organizers. The 48-year-old Pease was then given the black disqualification flag after completing less than half the number of laps the leaders had completed in an almost embarrassingly outdated Eagle-Climax, and became the only driver in F1 history ever to be disqualified for being too slow. The 1970 event saw Ickx win again with his Swiss teammate Clay Regazzoni making the result a Ferrari 1–2. But the Mont-Tremblant circuit was not used again for Formula One because of safety concerns regarding the bitter winters seriously affecting the track surface and a dispute with the local racing authorities there in 1972. The alternating of the race stopped and Mosport solely continued to hold the Canadian Grand Prix from 1971.

The 1971 event saw Mosport Park flooded with rain and fog; the main event was delayed after a fatal accident at a Formula Ford support race and by the time it started, it was raining heavily. Jackie Stewart took victory easily in a Tyrrell from Swede Ronnie Peterson in a March. 1972 saw Mosport upgraded with new safety features, and Stewart won again. 1973 was an interesting event; like the race 2 years previous it was a rain-soaked event. Austrian new-boy Niki Lauda in a BRM took the lead from Peterson in a Lotus on Lap 3, Lauda led until the 20th lap when he came to change tires; there was considerable confusion after François Cevert and Jody Scheckter collided on Lap 33 leading to a bungled pace car interlude after which things became very confused as the pace car failed to pick up the leader and allowed those ahead to gain almost a lap. All this meant that Briton Jackie Oliver ended up in the lead with American Peter Revson second and Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise third. Of these three Revson had the most competitive car and so eventually moved into the lead and led all the way to the flag while Peterson&#x27;s Brazilian teammate Emerson Fittipaldi charged to try to make up for lost ground and overtook Oliver and Beltoise in the closing laps to grab second. For hours after the race confusion reigned but eventually it was confirmed that Revson was the winner- thanks to a lucky break when the pace car came out. The 1974 event saw Fittipaldi win while his championship rivals Clay Regazzoni finished 2nd and Jody Scheckter crashed heavily after a brake failure on his Tyrrell. There was no 1975 event, and the 1976 event was one where Briton James Hunt found out that his 9 points from Brands Hatch were taken away and he was disqualified; Hunt won the Canadian Grand Prix event that year, driving furiously throughout the race.

1977 was the race where French-Canadian Gilles Villeneuve made his debut for Ferrari. But concerns about the bumpy Mosport Park&#x27;s safety arose when Briton Ian Ashley had a horrendous accident while cresting a bumpy rise. Ashley&#x27;s Hesketh flipped over the Armco guardrails and went into a television tower. The German-born Englishman was seriously injured and safety operations to rescue him were inefficient and time-consuming; and the lack of safety at Mosport was underlined when Jochen Mass lost control of his McLaren and hit a guardrail that virtually flattened upon impact. Jody Scheckter won this race in his Wolf, but with continuing safety concerns, a new proposal was brought forward. Labatt, the sponsor who held the rights to F1 racing in Canada at the time, as well as the owners of Mosport Park revived the 1968 proposal to move the race to Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Place after the FIA deemed Mosport as an unsuitable host facility going forward. Toronto city council turned down the proposal by a margin of two votes and within a few hours, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau had negotiated with Labatt to move the race permanently to Montreal. A third attempt at a Toronto race eventually came to fruition by competing Canadian brewer Molson in 1986 as the Molson Indy Toronto, part of the Indy Car World Series

A plan was quickly put together to develop a track called the Circuit Île Notre Dame on a man-made island in the middle of the St. Lawrence seaway that had been the site of the famous Expo &#x27;67; specific roads on the island were combined and modified, and then pit facilities were built to make a temporary race track. The Canadian Grand Prix was first held there in 1978 and it has been held there ever since, with the exception of four years when the event was cancelled.

====Montreal====
The first winner in Montreal was Quebec native Villeneuve, driving a Ferrari. 1979 saw circuit layout modifications to make it faster, and Australian Alan Jones win, and he then won the 1980 race and the Drivers&#x27; Championship that year. 1980 also saw a big startline pile-up with involved Jones&#x27;s Brazilian championship rival Nelson Piquet after he and Jones collided going into the very fast Droit du Casino corner. Piquet jumped into his spare car with a more powerful qualifying engine; but the engine blew up and Piquet retired from the race. Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jabouille&#x27;s season and F1 racing career came to an end when he crashed his Renault head-on into a tire wall. He had badly broken legs; it took the tall Frenchman months to recover. 1981 saw a rain-soaked event in which near end of the race, Villeneuve demonstrated his car control skill when the front wing of his Ferrari was askew from a crash and he drove on to third place with the car in this condition. Frenchman Jacques Laffite took what was to be his last F1 victory, followed by Briton John Watson and Villeneuve.

Villeneuve was killed in 1982 on his final qualifying lap for the Belgian Grand Prix. A few weeks after his death, the race course in Montreal was renamed Circuit Gilles Villeneuve after him. Gilles Villeneuve was one of the first people inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, and is so far the only Canadian winner of the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was a tragic event, in the shadow of the death of Villeneuve a month earlier. It saw another accident when Villeneuve&#x27;s teammate Didier Pironi stalled at the front of the grid. First, Raul Boesel struck a glancing blow to the stationary vehicle, and then Riccardo Paletti crashed directly into the rear of Pironi&#x27;s Ferrari at over . Pironi and F1 doctor Sid Watkins came to Paletti&#x27;s aid to try to extract him from his car, which briefly caught fire. After a half-hour, the 23-year-old Paletti was extracted and flown to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Nelson Piquet won the race in his Brabham. 1982 was also significant in that the race was moved from October to June with the event happening in early June ever since.

In 1983, Frenchman René Arnoux scored his first race win as a Ferrari driver, and the following year Piquet won again in a BMW-powered Brabham. 1985 saw Ferrari finish 1–2 with Italian Michele Alboreto and Swede Stefan Johansson taking top honours from Frenchman Alain Prost, while Lotus gained their final ever lock-out of the front row when Elio de Angelis and Ayrton Senna started 1–2. 1986 was a competitive race. Finn Keke Rosberg in a McLaren charged through the field, caught and then passed British leader Nigel Mansell. But Rosberg, like the other front runners, encountered problems, benefiting Mansell who won the race. In , the race was not held due to a sponsorship dispute between two local breweries, Labatt and Molson. During the break the track was modified, and starting line moved to its current position.

1988 saw Brazilian Ayrton Senna take victory in the all-conquering McLaren MP4/4 with its Honda turbo engine, and the following year he so very nearly won again, but the Honda engine in his McLaren failed and Belgian Thierry Boutsen took victory, which was the first in his F1 career. 1990, like the year before, was a rain-soaked event, and it saw a number of accidents; Senna came out to win again. 1991 saw a dramatic finale in which Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams failed on the very last lap only a few corners from the finish line; Nelson Piquet took his 23rd and final F1 victory in a Benetton. Austrian Gerhard Berger won the 1992 event after the dominant Mansell spun off after a collision with Berger&#x27;s teammate Senna.

Alain Prost won the 1993 event while fending off a spirited drive from Senna, and in response to the Imola tragedies, the 1994 event saw the very fast Droit du Casino curve being turned into a chicane. German Michael Schumacher won this event. Ferrari&#x27;s Jean Alesi won the 1995 edition, which occurred on his 31st birthday and which would be the only win of his career. Alesi had inherited the lead when Michael Schumacher pitted with electrical problems and Damon Hill&#x27;s hydraulics failed. The victory was a popular one for Alesi, particularly after several unrewarded drives the year before, namely in Italy. Alesi&#x27;s win at Montreal was voted the most popular race victory of the season by many, as it was the number 27 Ferrari—once belonging to the famous Gilles Villeneuve at his much loved home Grand Prix. Schumacher gave Alesi a lift back to the pits after Alesi&#x27;s car ran out of fuel just before the Pits Hairpin.

The Canadian Grand Prix race had grown in importance around this time; the demise of Grands Prix in Detroit, Phoenix and Mexico City meant that it had been the only North American Grand Prix round since 1993 and would continue to be the only round in North America up until 2000, and again from 2008 to 2011 after yet another demise of the United States Grand Prix, this time at Indianapolis. It was also one of two races in the entire Americas, the other being the Brazilian Grand Prix, although the Argentine Grand Prix had returned for 4 brief years from 1995 to 1998.

The 1996 race saw the Casino corner removed and the layout changed; the run from the hairpin at the bottom of the circuit was turned into a straight. Briton Damon Hill won this event, and the 1997 race was stopped early due to a crash involving Olivier Panis. He was sidelined for nine races and some see it as a turning point in the career of the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix winner. The races from 1997 to 2004 (except 1999 and 2001) saw a romp of Michael Schumacher victories, all in a Ferrari. 1999 saw Finn Mika Häkkinen win, and in 2001, there was the first sibling 1–2 finish in the history of Formula 1, as Ralf and Michael Schumacher topped the podium. The Schumacher brothers would finish 1–2 in the 2003 edition as well, 2001 was also noted for Jean Alesi achieving Prost&#x27;s best finish of the season; he celebrated his fifth place by doing several donuts in his vehicle, and throwing his helmet into the crowd.

The 2007 race was the site of rookie Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s first win. On lap 67, Takuma Sato overtook McLaren-Mercedes&#x27;s Fernando Alonso, to cheers around the circuit, just after overtaking Ralf Schumacher and having overtaken Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen earlier in the race. The race saw Sato move from the middle of the grid to the back of the pack and to a high of fifth before a pit-stop error caused him to move back to eleventh. Sato fought up 5 places in the field in the last 15 laps to finish sixth. Sato was voted &quot;Driver of the Day&quot; on the ITV website over Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s first win. The race also saw an atrocious crash involving Robert Kubica (who went on to win the race the following season, resulting to be his only one in F1).

=====2009 hiatus=====
On 7 October 2008, the Canadian Grand Prix was dropped from the Formula One calendar, which left the Montreal race off the list for the first time since . Since the United States Grand Prix was dropped after 2007, this meant that in 2009 no Formula One race was held in North America for the first time since 1958 (the American Indianapolis 500 formed part of the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 to 1960, but was not run to Formula One regulations and only very rarely entered by regular championship competitors).

During the Australian Grand Prix, reports surfaced that the Canadian Grand Prix could return during the 2009 season in the event that the race circuit in Abu Dhabi was not ready in time. On 26 April 2009, Speed reported Bernie Ecclestone as saying the FIA was negotiating a return of the Canadian Grand Prix for the 2010 season, provided upgrades to the circuit were completed.

On 29 August 2009, the BBC reported the provisional schedule for the season, which had both the Canadian and British Grand Prix marked down as &quot;provisional&quot;. The Canadian GP was originally scheduled for 6 June. The 2010 Canadian Grand Prix was eventually run in Montreal on 13 June 2010. On 27 November 2009, Quebec&#x27;s officials and Canadian Grand Prix organizers announced they had reached a settlement with Formula One Administration and signed a new five-year contract spanning the 2010–2014 seasons. Under the five-year agreement, the government pays 15 million Canadian dollars a year to host the race, much less than the 35 million a year Ecclestone initially asked for.

=====2010–present=====

The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix became the longest ever Formula One race to date; rainstorms delayed the race for hours; but when it got going again Briton Jenson Button stormed through the field from last place after the restart on lap 41 and caught German leader Sebastian Vettel; whom he forced into making a mistake, passed the Red Bull driver and the Briton took victory, in what he described as &quot;my best ever race&quot;. The 2013 Canadian Grand Prix saw Vettel dominate in his Red Bull, but it was also to see the first Formula One-related fatality in 12 years. Thirty-eight-year-old track marshal Mark Robinson was run over by a recovery vehicle, and the accident happened while marshals were removing the Sauber of Esteban Gutiérrez after the Mexican had spun off during the closing stages of the race. Robinson died later in hospital and became the first track-side death in Formula One since that of marshal Graham Beveridge at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix.

==Wildlife==
In the weeks leading up the Grand Prix, city officials trap as many groundhogs as they can in and around the race course, and transport the animals to nearby Île Ste-Helene. Nonetheless, in 1990, Alessandro Nannini struck a gopher on the track which damaged his tire. In 2007, a groundhog disrupted the practice session of Ralf Schumacher. On race day itself, Anthony Davidson had been running in third until he struck a groundhog, initially thought to be a beaver, which forced him to pit and repair the damage to his front wing. In 2008, a groundhog crossed the track at the hairpin in the 2nd practice session but luckily did not disrupt the session. In 2018, Romain Grosjean struck a groundhog in the 2nd practice session on the approach to turn 13, damaging his front wing. In 2022, Nicholas Latifi hit a groundhog in third practice in the braking zone of turn 8.

==Wall of Champions==

The final corner of Circuit Gilles Villeneuve became well known for crashes involving former World Champions. In 1999, Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve all crashed into the same wall at the final chicane. The wall became ironically known as the &quot;Wall of Champions&quot;. The wall also was involved in a crash with Ricardo Zonta, who was, at the time, the reigning FIA GT sports car champion. In recent years, CART Champion Juan Pablo Montoya, Formula Renault 3.5 Champion Carlos Sainz Jr. and 2009 Formula One World Champion Jenson Button have also fallen victim to the wall. In 2011 Friday practice the wall claimed 4-time F1 Champion Sebastian Vettel. During Q2 in 2019, the wall claimed another former Formula Renault 3.5 champion, Kevin Magnussen, though he escaped serious injury.

Before the wall was named it also claimed victims such as 1992 World Sportscar Champion and long-time F1 driver Derek Warwick who spectacularly crashed his Arrows-Megatron during qualifying for the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.

<text>William Henry Keeler (March 3, 1872 – January 1, 1923), nicknamed &quot;Wee Willie&quot; because of his small stature, was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1892 to 1910, primarily for the Baltimore Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas in the National League, and the New York Highlanders in the American League. In 1939, Keeler was posthumously elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. One of the greatest contact hitters of all time and notoriously hard to strike out, Keeler has the highest career at bats-per-strikeout ratio in MLB history, averaging 63.17 at bats between each strikeout. His plate appearance-per-strikeout ratio is also one of the best of all time, with Keeler averaging 70.66 plate appearances between strikeouts, second only to Joe Sewell, another Hall of Famer, who averaged 73.06 plate appearances between each strikeout.

==Early life==
William Henry O&#x27;Kelleher Jr. (he later Americanized the name to Keeler) was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 3, 1872, the son of William O&#x27;Kelleher Sr., a trolley switch man. He played baseball from an early age, and as a freshman served as captain of his high school team. He quit school the following year, and played semiprofessional baseball in the New York City area.

==Professional baseball career==
In 1892, after beginning the season playing his second year with the Plainfield Crescent Cities of the Central New Jersey League, he joined the minor league team in Binghamton, New York, and he was called up to the New York Giants at the end of the season. After a trip back to the minors because of an injury at the start of the 1893 season, he returned to the Giants later that year. Initially a third baseman, he later moved to the outfield. He quickly established himself as a star, and played until retiring in 1910.

Keeler&#x27;s advice to hitters was &quot;Keep your eye clear, and hit &#x27;em where they ain&#x27;t&quot;—&quot;they&quot; being the opposing fielders. His .385 career batting average after the 1898 season is the highest average in history at season&#x27;s end for a player with more than 1,000 hits (1,147 hits). He compiled a .341 career batting average, tied for 11th with Bill Terry and Pete Browning as of 2022. He hit over .300 16 times in 19 seasons, and hit over .400 once. He twice led his league in batting average and three times in hits. Keeler had an amazing 206 singles during the 1898 season, a record that stood for more than 100 years until broken by Ichiro Suzuki. Additionally, Keeler had an on-base percentage of greater than .400 for seven straight seasons. When Keeler retired in 1910, he was third all-time in hits with 2,932, behind only Cap Anson and Jake Beckley.

He was one of the smallest players to play the game, standing 5 feet 4½ inches and weighing 140 pounds (64 kg), resulting in his nickname. Keeler was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He appeared as number 75 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Baseball Players&quot;. In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Having played his last game in 1910, he was the most chronologically distant player on both Top 100 lists.
Keeler had the ability to bunt most balls pitched to him, enabling him to avoid striking out; his skill at prolonging at bats by fouling pitches off with this method was the impetus for the rule change that made a foul bunt with two strikes a strikeout. In the 1899 season for the Brooklyn Superbas, in 570 at bats, Keeler struck out only twice, setting an AB-per-K mark of 285, an MLB single-season record. With Ned Hanlon&#x27;s Baltimore Orioles, he perfected the &quot;Baltimore chop&quot;, in which he would chop the ball into the ground hard enough to cause a high bounce, which enabled him to reach first base before a fielder could glove the ball and throw him out. Bill James speculated that Keeler introduced the hit and run strategy to the original Orioles and teammate John McGraw. In James&#x27; theory, Boston&#x27;s Tommy McCarthy was the first manager to make wide use of the hit and run. McCarthy then taught it to John Montgomery Ward, who taught it to Keeler.

In forming the powerful original Baltimore Orioles of the late 19th century, manager Ned Hanlon was given an ownership stake in the team and a free rein to form his team. In one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history, Hanlon obtained Dan Brouthers and Keeler from Brooklyn in exchange for Billy Shindle and George Treadway. Keeler and six of his teammates from the Orioles were eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame.

In 1897, Keeler had a 44-game hitting streak to start the season, breaking the previous single season record of 42 set by Bill Dahlen. Keeler had a hit in his final game of the 1896 season, giving him a National League-record 45-game hitting streak. In 1941, this mark was bettered in the American League by Joe DiMaggio, who had a 56-game hitting streak. In 1978, Pete Rose tied Keeler&#x27;s single season NL mark of 44 games. No other player in baseball has ever matched this feat. Keeler also had eight consecutive seasons with 200 hits or more, a record broken by Ichiro Suzuki in 2009.

In 1901, when Ban Johnson formed the American League, one of the first acts was to raid the National League and offer their stars big contracts. In 1901, Keeler received offers from six of the eight new American League clubs, including an offer from Chicago for two years at $4,300 a season ($ in current dollar terms). Keeler remained in Brooklyn and did not actually jump to the new league until 1903, when he signed with the New York Highlanders (renamed the Yankees in 1913). In 1905, Keeler set the Yankees team record for most sacrifice hits in a season with 42. Keeler was the Yankees&#x27; captain during the 1908 and 1909 seasons.

Keeler remained with the Highlanders through 1909, and played the 1910 season with the New York Giants. Keeler played in 1911 for the Eastern League&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs, and had 43 hits in 39 games.

==Later life==
In 1901 and 1902, while still an active player, Keeler was the head coach of the Manhattan Jaspers baseball team. After his retirement, Keeler was a scout and coach for the Superbas and the Boston Braves, as well as Brooklyn&#x27;s Federal League team, the Tip-Tops. He was wealthy after retiring as a player, and invested in mining companies, real estate, and other ventures. His real estate lost value in the post-World War I economic recession, and by the time of his death, his brothers and he had to sell their childhood home.

Keeler was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and Knights of Columbus.

Keeler suffered from tuberculosis and endocarditis for the last five years of his life. By late 1922, his condition had worsened and whether he would live into the new year was doubtful. Seriously ill by New Year&#x27;s Eve, he heard bells and sirens in the streets when the new year arrived. Keeler sat up and said to his brother, &quot;You see, the new year is here and so am I—still.&quot; He enjoyed a drink and a smoke, then said that he was ready for a long sleep. A short time later, Keeler died; he was 50. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

Keeler is mentioned in the story &quot;Hit &#x27;em where they ain&#x27;t&quot; by Robert Ruark and as well in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash.

<doc id="247641" wikidata="Q15490293" url="?curid=247641" title="Systemic bias">
<text>Systemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support particular outcomes. The term generally refers to human systems such as institutions. Systemic bias is related to and overlaps conceptually with institutional bias and structural bias, and the terms are often used interchangeably.

In systemic bias institutional practices tend to exhibit a bias which leads to the preferential treatment or advantage of specific social groups, while others experience disadvantage or devaluation. This bias may not necessarily stem from intentional prejudice or discrimination but rather from the adherence to established rules and norms by the majority.

Systemic bias includes institutional, systemic, and structural bias which can lead to institutional racism, which is a type of racism that is integrated into the laws, norms, and regulations of a society or establishment. Structural bias, in turn, has been defined more specifically in reference to racial inequities as &quot;the normalized and legitimized range of policies, practices, and attitudes that routinely produce cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for minority populations&quot;. The issues of systemic bias are dealt with extensively in the field of industrial organization economics.

==In human institutions==
Cognitive bias is inherent in the experiences, loyalties, and relationships of people in their daily lives, and new biases are constantly being discovered and addressed on both an ethical and political level. For example, the goal of affirmative action in the United States is to counter biases concerning gender, race, and ethnicity, by opening up institutional participation to people with a wider range of backgrounds, and hence a wider range of points of view. In India, the system of Scheduled Castes and Tribes intends to address systemic bias caused by the controversial caste system, a system centered on organized discrimination based upon one&#x27;s ancestry, not unlike the system that affirmative action aims to counter. Both the scheduling system and affirmative action mandate the hiring of citizens from within designated groups. However, without sufficient restrictions based upon the actual socio-economic standing of the recipients of the aid provided, these types of systems can allegedly result in the unintentional institutionalization of a reversed form of the same systemic bias, which works against the goal of rendering institutional participation open to people with a wider range of backgrounds.

Unconscious bias training has become common in many organizations, which is theorized to address both systemic and structural bias. This training addressed the practices and policies of the organization, such as hiring practices that favor social networking, or a grooming policy that disadvantages people with Afro-textured hair.

==Major causes==
The study of systemic bias as part of the field titled organizational behavior in industrial organization economics is studied in several principle modalities in both non-profit and for-profit institutions. The issue of concern is that patterns of behavior may develop within large institutions which become harmful to the productivity and viability of the larger institutions from which they develop, as well as the community they occupy. The three major categories of study for maladaptive organizational behavior and systemic bias are counterproductive work behavior, human resource mistreatment, and the amelioration of stress-inducing behavior.

Racism

Racism is prejudice, discrimination or hostility towards other people because they are of a different racial or ethnic origin. Medical students conducted studies to investigate systemic biases associated with race. The result of the study showed that due to systemic bias, certain groups of people are marginalized due to race and differences, their professional careers are threatened, and more homework/responsibility is given to those in the minority group.

Counterproductive work behavior

Counterproductive work behavior consists of behavior by employees that harms or intends to harm organizations and people in organizations.

Mistreatment of human resources

There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations.

* Abusive supervision: the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.
* Bullying: although definitions of bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.
* Incivility: low-intensity discourteous and rude behavior with ambiguous intent to harm that violates norms for appropriate behavior in the workplace.
* Sexual harassment: behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to their gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do their job.
* Occupational stress: the imbalance between the demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help cope with these demands.

==Examples==
&quot;Financial Week&quot; reported in May 2008:

==Versus systematic bias==
In engineering and computational mechanics, the word &quot;bias&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym of systematic error. In this case, the bias is referred to the result of a measurement or computation, rather than to the measurement instrument or computational method.

Some authors try to draw a distinction between systemic and systematic corresponding to that between unplanned and planned, or to that between arising from the characteristics of a system and from an individual flaw. In a less formal sense, &quot;systemic&quot; biases are sometimes said to arise from the nature of the interworkings of the system, whereas &quot;systematic&quot; biases stem from a concerted effort to favor certain outcomes. Consider the difference between affirmative action (systematic) compared to racism and caste (systemic).

<doc id="247643" wikidata="Q320994" url="?curid=247643" title="House arrest">
<text>House arrest (also called home confinement, or [[Electronic monitoring in the United States|electronic monitoring]]) is a legal measure where a person is required to remain at their residence under supervision, typically as an alternative to imprisonment. The person is confined by the authorities to their residence. Travel is usually restricted and may require prior approval. 

During house arrest, the individual may be monitored electronically, and their movements are typically tracked. House arrest is also used in some cases for individuals convicted of minor offenses. In certain situations, such as in authoritarian regimes, house arrest may be used to restrict the freedom of political governments against political dissidents, sometimes limiting or monitoring their communication with the outside world. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored. There are many critiques on how effective house arrest is. 

==History==
Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. Galileo was confined to his home following his infamous trial in 1633. Authorities often used house arrest to confine political leaders who were deposed in a coup d&#x27;état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals. Over time, though, house arrest became more popular, especially as prisons and jails became overcrowded and expensive.

However, this method didn&#x27;t become a widely used alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other Western countries until the 20th century, after it was introduced in the U.S. in 1984. Around this time, newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it more affordable and easier for corrections authorities to manage. Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an electronic bracelet was in 1983.

House arrest and electronic monitoring programs are among the most widely used alternatives to incarceration. It has been estimated that in 2005 roughly 20% of community-based supervision involved the use of electronic monitoring. 

The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the use of house arrest as well. To stop the spread of the virus in crowded prisons, many governments allowed people to serve their sentences at home instead. This was mostly done for non-violent offenders or people close to finishing their prison terms. 

==Details==
Home detention is an alternative to imprisonment; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States. It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending.

The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the probation officer or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments. Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.

The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A curfew may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. &quot;Home confinement&quot; or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. 

The most serious level of house arrest is &quot;home incarceration&quot;, under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.

In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without trial or legal representation, and subject to restrictions on their associates. In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender&#x27;s human right to a fair trial. In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent. 

==Using technology for enforcement==
In some countries, house arrest is enforced through the use of technology products or services. One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender&#x27;s ankle (technically called an ankle monitor, also referred to as a tether). The electronic sensor transmits an RF signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.

If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal. The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the officer or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant&#x27;s whereabouts. The monitoring service notifies a convict&#x27;s probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.

Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The respondent&#x27;s answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender&#x27;s voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender&#x27;s voice pattern.

Electronic monitoring is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence. However, it’s important to recognize that “compared with non-custodial sanctions, incarceration appears to have a null or mildly criminogenic effect on future criminal behavior.” This means that while house arrest can be a better option than prison, its effectiveness in preventing reoffending prisoners can vary from person to person. 

== Critiques ==

House arrest, especially used as electronically monitored home confinement, has received criticism for many reasons. Critics argue that while the system is meant to provide a sense of freedom, it actually leads to limitations on personal choice and privacy. Erving Goffman, a Canadian Sociologist, talks about his ideas of total institutions, which leads to these critiques. &quot;Goffman uses the term ‘‘total institutions’’ as a sensitizing concept to refer to organizations that separate certain types of people from the rest of society&quot;. He describes total institutions as places that separate individuals from society and control their daily lives. The use of house arrest is direct description of what he talks about. Although house arrest allows individuals to stay at home, it uses similar restrictions that jails and prisons have through the electronic monitoring. &quot;It would seem that those under house arrest would have the opposite experience, as they are actually confined to their home world. Yet, while a sentence to electronic monitoring means that clients still spend time with their family and domestic partners, the disciplinary regime of house arrest significantly shapes those relationships&quot;. &quot;House arrest officers also meet with ‘‘collateral contacts’’ and make unannounced on-site visits to places of employment and residences.&quot; Residence checks by law enforcement in house arrest programs can be seen as invasive and cause privacy issues for people serving time. &quot;Spelman (1995) had 128 convicted offenders rate the punitiveness of criminal sanctions. He found that 75% identified some intermediate sanctions as being more punitive than a sentence of incarceration.&quot; Many of these offenders felt that alternative punishments outside of prison were more difficult or restrictive than serving time behind bars. This could be due to the constant surveillance, loss of personal freedom, or the challenges of living under close restrictions. These strict rules have many critiques facing the system and look for a return of action.

==Notable instances==
===Algeria===
* Ahmed Ben Bella, former president of Algeria, deposed by Houari Boumédiènne in 1965. He was held under house arrest before being exiled in 1980.

===Argentina===
* Jorge Videla, former dictator of Argentina (was held by house arrest only for a period)

===Australia===
* Derryn Hinch, New Zealand media personality based in Melbourne, Australia; he was placed under house arrest for five months for breaching gag orders by naming two sex offenders.

===Myanmar (Burma)===
* Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and leader of her country&#x27;s pro-democracy movement, was punished with house arrest for most of the period from July 1989 to November 2010. After being released from her initial confinement after six years in 1995, she was convicted again and imprisoned in 2000. Two years later, she was again released. She was convicted and jailed for the third time under house arrest for her criticism of the government following the infamous Depayin Massacre in 2003. After her 14th year of prison, she was released to her dilapidated home in Rangoonhe.

===Italy===
In Italy, house arrest (in Italian &quot;arresti domiciliari&quot;) is a common practice of detaining suspects, as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in their house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where they may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with them or those who assist them. If the subject is unable to take care of their life necessities or if they are in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize them to leave their home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is &quot;de facto&quot; considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of escape within the previous five years.

<text>Amherst ( ) is a town in northwestern Nova Scotia, Canada, located at the northeast end of the Cumberland Basin, an arm of the Bay of Fundy, and south of the Northumberland Strait. The town sits on a height of land at the eastern boundary of the Isthmus of Chignecto and Tantramar Marshes, east of the interprovincial border with New Brunswick and southeast of the city of Moncton. It is southwest of the New Brunswick abutment of the Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island at Cape Jourimain.

==History==

According to Dr. Graham P. Hennessey, &quot;The Micmac name was &quot;Nemcheboogwek&quot; meaning &#x27;going up rising ground&#x27;, in reference to the higher land to the east of the Tantramar Marshes. The Acadians who settled here as early as 1672 called the village &quot;Les Planches&quot;. The village was later renamed Amherst by Colonel Joseph Morse in honour of Lord Amherst, the commander-in-chief of the British Army in North America during the Seven Years&#x27; War.&quot;

The town was first settled in 1764 by immigrants from Yorkshire following the expulsion of the Acadians, with the original settlement being located southwest of the present town on the shore of the Bay of Fundy. These settlers were joined by United Empire Loyalists (Loyalists who fled the American colonies during the American Revolution). A mill was built on the current townsite, and the residents moved there to be closer to work.

During the 19th century, Amherst became an important regional centre for shipbuilding and other services to outlying communities. An indication of the town&#x27;s importance in Canadian history is seen with its four Fathers of Confederation: Edward B. Chandler, Robert B. Dickey, Jonathan McCully, and Sir Charles Tupper.

During the late 19th century, local industrialists and entrepreneurs constructed many fine Victorian and Edwardian homes along Victoria Street East, leading toward the farming hamlet of East Amherst. Many notable residents have lived in this district, including Sir Charles Tupper and Senator Thomas R. Black. 

Amherst gained brief notoriety in the late 19th century as the location of alleged poltergeist phenomena afflicting Amherst resident Esther Cox in 1878 and 1879, which became known as the Great Amherst Mystery after the publication of a popular book on the affair.
Amherst experienced unprecedented industrialization in the late 1870s after the Intercolonial Railway of Canada constructed its main line from Halifax to Quebec through the town in 1872. The location of the railway line away from the Bay of Fundy coast further consolidated the town at its present location as industry and commercial activity centred around this important transportation link. The economic boom created by the arrival of the Intercolonial Railway lasted through World War I and numerous foundries, factories and mills opened, giving rise to the nickname &quot;Busy Amherst&quot;.

In 1908, the manufacturing output of Amherst&#x27;s industries was not exceeded by any centre in the Maritime Provinces. Many of the fine old buildings along Victoria Street are considered industrial artifacts because they were constructed during a period of tremendous industry growth. Local contractors employed local craftsmen, who used local materials. Notice the emphasis on sandstone and brick, both locally produced and delightful detail which reflects the skilled craftsmanship prevalent in the 19th century.

Amherst&#x27;s prosperity would not last as the failed economic policies of the federal and provincial governments, coupled with World War I, saw the town&#x27;s industrial economy begin a slow decline during the 1910s. The Amherst Internment Camp for prisoners of war and enemy aliens was set up at Malleable Iron Foundry in Amherst from April 1915 to September 1919, and Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky was incarcerated there for one month after he was arrested in Halifax, Nova Scotia in April 1917.

During the Amherst general strike in 1919, worker unrest over social and economic conditions led to mass protests in sympathy with the Winnipeg general strike.

The eventual closure of companies such as Robb Engineering &amp; Manufacturing (purchased by Canada Car and Foundry and then closed) and Amherst Pianos, among others led to a resignation of lost dreams as the town was overtaken by other newer manufacturing centres in central Canada during the 20th century. Amherst had a modest-sized industrial park constructed during the 1960s when the Trans-Canada Highway was being developed. Today the majority of the town&#x27;s major employers are located there, including Emmerson Packaging and IMP Aerospace.

During the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy named a .

In 2002, the Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre opened on the outskirts of the town, replacing the older Highland View Regional Hospital on Pleasant Street.

The town is currently served by Via Rail&#x27;s Halifax-to-Montreal train &quot;Ocean&quot;.

==Sports==
Basketball was introduced to Nova Scotia at the YMCA in Amherest in 1894, by J. Howard Crocker who learned the game as a student of James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.

Amherst is home of the Amherst Ramblers, a Junior A Hockey League team from the Maritime Hockey League. All home games are played out of the 2,500 seat Amherst Stadium. The season usually runs from mid-September to early March every year. The Ramblers draw some of the largest crowds in the Maritime Hockey League, and have placed third in average attendance over the past few years. They won the Atlantic Championship in 1989 advancing to the Centennial Cup tournament in BC. They also hosted the Centennial Cup in 1993 and the Fred Page Cup in 2019.

Every August, Amherst hosts an eight-team little league baseball tournament, featuring four teams from New England.

In the period between 1996 and 2006, Amherst lost over half of its Black population. The African Nova Scotian community has lived in the area since 1783, largely settled around the south end of the town in an area called &quot;Sand Hill&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Martyrs (), also known as the North American Martyrs (French: Saints martyrs canadiens, Holy Canadian Martyrs), were eight Jesuit missionaries from Sainte-Marie among the Hurons. They were ritually tortured and killed on various dates in the mid-17th century in Canada, in what is now southern Ontario, and in upstate New York, during the warfare between the Iroquioan tribes the Mohawk and the Huron. They have subsequently been canonized and venerated as martyrs by the Catholic Church.

The martyrs are:

==Background==
Jesuit missionaries worked among the Huron (Wendat), an Iroquoian-speaking people who occupied territory in the Georgian Bay area of Central Ontario. (They were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, initially made up of five tribes south and east of the Great Lakes.) The area of their traditional territory is called Huronia. The Huron in this area were farmers, fishermen and traders who lived in villages surrounded by defensive wooden palisades for protection. Sainte-Marie among the Hurons was the headquarters for the French Jesuit Mission to the Huron Wendat people.

By the late 1640s, the Jesuits believed they were making progress in their mission to the Huron, and claimed to have made many converts. But, the priests were not universally trusted. Many Huron considered them to be malevolent shamans who brought death and disease wherever they travelled; after European contact, the Huron had suffered high fatalities in epidemics after 1634 of smallpox and other Eurasian infectious diseases.

The nations of the Iroquois Confederacy considered the Jesuits legitimate targets of their raids and warfare, as the missionaries were nominally allies of the Huron and French fur traders. Retaliating for French colonial attacks against the Iroquois was also a reason for their raids against the Huron and Jesuits.

In 1642, the Mohawk captured René Goupil, and Father Isaac Jogues, bringing them back to their village of Ossernenon south of the Mohawk River. They ritually tortured both men and killed Goupil. After several months of captivity, Jogues was ransomed by Dutch traders and the minister Johannes Megapolensis from New Netherland (later Albany). He returned for a time to France, but then sailed back to Quebec. In 1646 he and Jean de Lalande were killed during a visit to Ossernenon intended to achieve peace between the French and the Mohawk.

Other Jesuit missionaries were killed by the Mohawk and martyred in the following years: Antoine Daniel (1648), Jean de Brébeuf (1649), Noël Chabanel (1649), Charles Garnier (1649), and Gabriel Lalemant (1649). All were canonized in 1930 as the Canadian Martyrs, also known as the North American Martyrs.

==Legacy and honours==

The martyrs were canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1930. They are collectively the secondary patron saints of Canada. St. René Goupil, St. Isaac Jogues, and St. Jean de Lalande are the first three U.S. saints, martyred at Ossernenon, 9 miles (14.5 km) west of the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers. Their feast day is celebrated in the General Roman Calendar and in the United States on October 19 under the title of &quot;John de Brébeuf and Isaac Jogues, Priests, and Companions, Martyrs,&quot; and in Canada on September 26.

<text>Mario Mendoza Aizpuru (born 26 December 1950) is a Mexican former professional baseball infielder who is currently the manager of Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League. Mendoza, a lifetime .215 hitter, is best known for being the source of the name for the threshold for batting ineptitude, the &quot;Mendoza Line&quot;, meaning a batting average of .200. Mendoza managed in the minor leagues and in Mexico after his nine-year Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career. He is a member of the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Mendoza first caught the eye of the Pittsburgh Pirates while playing for the Mexico City Diablos Rojos of the Mexican League in 1970. His ability for picking grounders prompted the Pirates to purchase Mendoza&#x27;s contract from Mexico City.

Mendoza played four seasons in the Pirates&#x27; farm system before debuting with the Pirates on April 26, 1974, as a pinch runner for Willie Stargell. With the Pirates down 3–2 in the ninth inning to the Houston Astros, Mendoza scored the tying run in the Pirates&#x27; 4–3 victory. For the season, Mendoza batted .221 in 91 games, but had only 177 plate appearances as he was primarily a defensive replacement when starting Pirates shortstop Frank Taveras (who himself only had a .246 batting average in 1974) had been pinch hit for late in a game. He reached the postseason for the only time in his career during his rookie season. He started game three of the 1974 National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and went one for three with a walk and an RBI infield single.

On June 28, 1977, Mendoza pitched two innings of mop up duty in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Pirates, having used seven pitchers in a doubleheader with the Montreal Expos two days earlier, had already used three pitchers in the first-game 6–1 loss. Completely depleted of pitchers, Pirates manager Chuck Tanner started relief pitcher Grant Jackson in the second game, pitching six innings despite giving up ten runs (only six of which were earned), and the Pirates were already down 10–3 by the time Mendoza was handed the ball. After getting Keith Hernandez to line into a double play to end his first inning of work, Mendoza gave up a three-run home run to Ken Reitz the following inning, giving Mendoza a career 13.50 earned run average.

Mendoza remained with the Pirates as a defensive replacement through 1978, playing some second and third base as well. In five seasons with the Pirates, Mendoza batted .221, .180, .185, .198, and .218, respectively.

===Seattle Mariners===
Mendoza&#x27;s request for a trade was granted at the Winter Meetings on December 5, 1978, when he was dealt along with Odell Jones and Rafael Vásquez from the Pirates to the Seattle Mariners for Enrique Romo, Tom McMillan and Rick Jones. In his first season with the Mariners in 1979, he made a career-high 401 plate appearances in a career high 148 games and 132 starts at shortstop. While providing the Mariners with a steady glove, he ended the season with a .198 batting average—making him only the fourth major leaguer ever to play as many as 148 games in a season and fail to break .200. The following year, Mendoza fared better at the plate, batting .245 in 277 at-bats.

===Texas Rangers===
Mendoza was traded along with Willie Horton, Rick Honeycutt, Leon Roberts and Larry Cox from the Mariners to the Texas Rangers for Richie Zisk, Jerry Don Gleaton, Rick Auerbach, Ken Clay, Brian Allard and minor-league right-handed pitcher Steve Finch in an 11-player blockbuster deal on December 18, 1980. In 1981, Mendoza split time at short with Mark Wagner with Mendoza receiving the bulk of the playing time, and finishing with a .231 batting average. During the following season, he was released in June 1982 with a .118 batting average.

===Return to Mexico===
Mendoza received an invitation to spring training with the Pirates in 1983. After failing to make the team, he accepted a player-coach position with their triple A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders. After one season in Hawaii, Mendoza returned to Mexico as a player/manager of the Monclova Acereros.

Mendoza only managed Monclova for part of his first season back in the Mexican League, but his playing career in Mexico lasted seven seasons after his major league career ended. His career batting average in Mexico was a substantially better .291; he earned the nickname &quot;Manos de Seda,&quot; or &quot;Silk Hands&quot;, for his fielding prowess.

==Managerial career==
Bill Bavasi, an executive with the Anaheim Angels, believed Mendoza was someone who had potential as a manager and offered him the reins to the Angels&#x27; Class A advanced California League affiliate, Lake Elsinore Storm, for the 1998 season. He remained with the Storm until they became a San Diego Padres affiliate in 2001, managing his son, Mario Jr., in 2000.

Mendoza was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. After managing the San Francisco Giants&#x27; double A Texas League affiliate Shreveport SwampDragons in 2002, Mendoza returned to Mexico to manage Dos Laredos in 2003, the Angelopolis Tigres in 2004, the Olmecas de Tabasco in 2005 and 2006, and the Piratas de Campeche in 2007. He was named manager of the Broncos de Reynosa during the 2012 season. He was dismissed as Reynosa&#x27;s manager in May 2013 after the team started in first place with a 30–23 win–loss record; team leadership cited differences of opinion with Mendoza.

Mendoza became manager of the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League on 4 May 2023. He was sacked by the team on 5 June 2023.

==The &quot;Mendoza Line&quot;==
Mendoza claims that the term was invented in 1979 by his Mariner teammates Bruce Bochte and Tom Paciorek. Bochte and Paciorek would tease Mendoza about his low batting average, as he struggled to hit .200 for the season - and throughout his career, finishing below .200 five times in his nine seasons in the big leagues. 

Although Mendoza finished his career with a batting average of .215, the Mendoza Line is almost universally accepted as being at .200, an average Mendoza flirted with all that year. From May 10 to the end of the season it fluctuated between .175 and .210, usually staying within just a few points of .200 before finishing at .198.

The &#x27;Mendoza Line&#x27; phrase was overheard by Kansas City Royals batting champion George Brett, who used it in an interview in 1980 during his pursuit of a .400 batting average. He reportedly stated, &quot;The first thing I look for in the Sunday papers is who is below the Mendoza line.&quot; The reference caught the attention of ESPN announcer Chris Berman, and the &quot;Mendoza Line&quot; became part of popular culture. However, Brett also praised Mendoza&#x27;s defensive abilities, claiming Mendoza robbed him of sure base hits on several occasions with exceptional defensive plays.

<text>Kentville is an incorporated town in Nova Scotia. It is the most populous town in the Annapolis Valley. As of 2021, the town&#x27;s population was 6,630. Its census agglomeration is 26,929.

==History==
Kentville owes its location to the Cornwallis River which, downstream from Kentville, becomes a large tidal river at the Minas Basin. The riverbank at the current location of Kentville provided an easy fording point. The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the location was &quot;Penooek&quot;. The ford and later the bridge in Kentville made the area an important crossroads for other settlements in the Annapolis Valley. Kentville also marked the limit of navigation of sailing ships.

===Acadian settlement===
The area was first settled by Acadians, who built many dykes along the river to keep the high Bay of Fundy tides out of their farmland. These dykes created the ideal fertile soil that the Annapolis Valley is known for. The Acadians were expelled from the area in the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) by the British authorities because they would not swear allegiance to the British king. The area was then settled by New England Planters. Settlement was expedited by the United Empire Loyalists during the American Revolution.

===English settlement===
The town was originally known as Horton&#x27;s Corner, but was named Kentville in 1826 after Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent (son of King George III and father of Queen Victoria), who resided in Nova Scotia from 1794 to 1800. The village was at first relatively small and dwarfed by larger valley towns with better harbours such as Canning and Wolfville. The crossroads location did attract early shopkeepers and several stagecoach inns. Small schooners were able to land cargos in the &quot;Klondyke&quot; neighhourhood by the Cornwallis River which marked the height of navigation. Kentville developed a reputation for rowdy drinking and horse races in the early 19th century, earning the nickname &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Half Acre.&quot; Celebrated local musician, Chase Ross, later released an album entitled &quot;Devil&#x27;s Half Acre&quot; to critical acclaim in the early years of the new millennium.

=== Mi&#x27;Kmaq and African Nova Scotian communities ===
Prior to the Town&#x27;s establishment, the northern areas close to the Cornwallis River area of the municipality – once known as Pine Woods - was home to a substantial Mi’kmaq community until well into the twentieth century. The first English speaking settlers - The New England Planters - arrived between 1759 - 1768 and quickly occupied fertile farming lands south of the area that were once settled by the expelled Acadians. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the area began to see large numbers of Black Nova Scotian families settle into the Pinewoods area (Now the north end of Kentville and Aldershot) who had been enslaved people of the Planters, descendants of enslaved people or freed black Loyalists from the United States of America. Pine Woods is one of the 52 Historic Black Communities of Nova Scotia. Since its establishment in 1886 the town has become a destination to many diverse cultures from all over the world and is the fastest growing Town in Nova Scotia. Today the town attracts people from the Philippines, Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the middle east and China.

===Growth===

When the Windsor and Annapolis Railway (later named Dominion Atlantic Railway) established its headquarters in Kentville in 1868 and began shipping Annapolis Valley apples to British markets, the community began to thrive. The railway not only employed a large number of people (up to a third of the town&#x27;s population), but also attracted other industries such as mills, dairies, a large foundry, and a carriage works which even entered automobile production. A branch line of the Dominion Atlantic, the Cornwallis Valley Railway, was built north to Canning and Kingsport in 1889, further developing the apple industry and creating a suburban line for workers, shoppers and schoolchildren to commute to and from Kentville. The railway also attracted large institutional developments such as a regional TB hospital, the Kentville Sanitorium, a federal agricultural research station, and an army training base at Camp Aldershot.

The town became a major travel centre highlighted by the large Cornwallis Inn built at the town&#x27;s centre by the railway. The town boomed during World War I and World War II with heavy wartime railway traffic on the Dominion Atlantic and the training of thousands of troops at Camp Aldershot. Many residents fought overseas in the local West Nova Scotia Regiment as well as other branches of service. A Royal Canadian Navy minesweeper was named after the town, and her crew often took leave in Kentville.

===Post war challenges===

Kentville faced serious challenges after World War II. The dominant apple industry suffered severe declines due to the loss of its British export market. The nearby military training base at Camp Aldershot was significantly downsized and the town&#x27;s major employer, the Dominion Atlantic Railway suffered serious declines with the collapse of the apple industry and the growth of highway travel. Further decline followed in the 1970s as the town lost its retail core to the growth of shopping malls and later &quot;big box&quot; stores in nearby New Minas. The town was also eclipsed in restaurant, upscale retail and cultural institutions by the nearby university town of Wolfville. Railway passenger service ended in 1990. Freight service ended in October 1993 and the Kentville rail shops were closed and moved to Windsor, Nova Scotia. Kentville lost many heritage buildings in the postwar period and is one of the few towns in Nova Scotia without a single designated heritage building. Major losses included the large railway station, one of the most historic in Canada which was demolished in 1990. In July 2007 the town demolished the last railway structure in town, the DAR Roundhouse, despite a province-wide protest, a move which earned the Town of Kentville a place on the &quot;2008 Worst&quot; List of the Heritage Canada Foundation.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kentville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Industries==
During the early part of the 20th century Kentville emerged as the business centre of Kings County and despite the post-war loss of commerce to other valley communities, it remains the professional centre of the Annapolis Valley. Kentville is home to numerous professional services such as lawyers offices, doctors, and investment firms. On the outskirts of the town is the Valley Regional Hospital, built in 1991. The town is also home to the Annapolis Valley Regional Industrial Park which employs numerous people in the area through a variety of different businesses.

Agriculture, especially fruit crops such as apples, remain a prominent industry in the Kentville area, and throughout the eastern part of the valley. Kentville is home to one of the largest agricultural research facilities in Nova Scotia founded in 1911, known to the locals as The Research Station. The site now employs over 200 people and sits on of the land at the east end of the town.

Kentville shares its northern boundary along the Cornwallis River with Camp Aldershot, a military training base founded in 1904. At its peak during World War II, the camp housed approximately 7000 soldiers. Kentville native Donald Ripley wrote a book chronicling Camp Aldershot and its effect on the town entitled &quot;On The Home Front&quot;. Today the camp functions as an army reserve training centre and is the headquarters of The West Nova Scotia Regiment.

=== Electric utility (sold 1997) ===

Kentville until 1997-8 was one of seven Nova Scotia towns (along with Riverport, Berwick, Canso, Antigonish, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay) to own its own electricity distribution utility within town limits – the Kentville Electric Commission. When the other six joined into the Municipal Electric Utilities of Nova Scotia in January 1998, Kentville instead sold its utility to Nova Scotia Power, a privately owned generator and distributor whose service area covered the rest of the province.

==Community events==
The Apple Blossom Festival, founded in 1933 is held each May to celebrate the blossoming of local apple industry, one of the region&#x27;s richest forms of agriculture.

Kentville is also well known for its Pumpkin People Festival .

<doc id="247652" wikidata="Q81039" url="?curid=247652" title="Bulldog bat">
<text>The bat family Noctilionidae, commonly known as bulldog bats or fishing bats, is represented by two extant species, the greater and the lesser bulldog bats, as well as at least one fossil species, &quot;Noctilio lacrimaelunaris&quot;, from the Miocene of Argentina. The naked bulldog bat (&quot;Cheiromeles torquatus&quot;) does not belong to this family, but to the family Molossidae, the free-tailed bats. They are found near water in the Neotropics, from Mexico to Argentina and also in the Caribbean islands. In these areas they can be found roosting in groups within hollow trees, caves, manmade homes, or other openings with enough space. While the two species exhibit different social and foraging behaviors both tend to return to a main roosting spot while also visiting other alternative roosting spots. 

==Description==
The bulldog bats have orange to brown fur, and range in head-body length from 7 to 14 cm and weight of 20-75 g, which makes them quite large. They have relatively long legs, large feet (exceptionally so in the case of the greater bulldog bat), and strong claws. Their wings are long (up to 60 cm in spread) and narrow, and their ears are large, funnel shaped and pointed. Unusual among bats, they have cheek-pouches for storing food. They also have full lips divided by a fold of skin giving a &#x27;hare lip&#x27; look which together with the cheek pouches gives them their bulldog-like appearance.

Their maxillae and premaxillae are fused for the strong support of the large upper medial incisors. Dental formula: 2/1, 1/1, 1/2, 3/3 = 28. The molars are tuberculosectorial. Unlike in other bats, the last cervical vertebra is not fused with the first thoracic. The wing second finger has a long metacarpal and a vestigial phalanx. The ischia are fused to each other and to the sacrum. The latter is keel-like. 

==Ecology and behaviour==
The species of lesser bulldog bats are insectivorous, and while the greater bulldog bats also eat insects, their chief food is fish (piscivorous). They use their echolocation to pinpoint the ripples they make on the surfaces of water.

The greater bulldog bat trawls the water with its long, curved talons approximately 2–3 cm below the surface. It makes sweeps of between 30 cm and 3 m before ascending and turning to make a return sweep. In a single night, the bat may catch 20-30 small fish in this way.

<text>Springhill is a community located in central Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, Canada.

The community was founded as &quot;Springhill Mines&quot;. Coal mining led to economic growth, with its incorporation as a town in 1889. The mines in the Springhill coalfield were established in the 19th century, and by the early 1880s were being worked by the Cumberland Coal &amp; Railway Company Ltd. and the Springhill &amp; Parrsboro Coal &amp; Railway Company Ltd. These entities merged in 1884 to form the Cumberland Railway &amp; Coal Company Ltd., which its investors sold in 1910 to the industrial conglomerate Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO). All coal mining had ceased in the area by the early 1970s. The community is famous for both the Springhill Mining Disaster and being the childhood home of international recording star Anne Murray, who is honoured by the Anne Murray Centre, a popular tourist attraction.

As of 2015 the mine properties, among the deepest in the world with the No. 2 mine reaching 14,300 feet, are filled with water. They provide Springhill&#x27;s industrial park with geothermal heating. Geothermal energy from the waters of the abandoned mines is capable of providing heating and cooling for large buildings through the use of heat pumps. Because the water in a mine circulates by convection, shallow wells produce water of a temperature significantly higher than groundwater of the same depth.

In 2015 the Town of Springhill amalgamated into the Municipality of the County of Cumberland.

== Anne Murray Centre ==
The Anne Murray Centre showcases the life and times of Springhill&#x27;s internationally acclaimed songstress Anne Murray. Visitors can step into the story of this Canadian icon and take an intimate look at her humble beginnings, flight to fame, and enduring contributions to the world of music.

Murray was born and raised in Springhill, Nova Scotia. Her father, James Carson Murray, was the Springhill town doctor for many years. Her mother, Marion Margaret Murray, was a registered nurse who focused her life on raising her family and community charity work. The Dr. Carson &amp; Marion Murray Community Centre is named after her parents and is a short distance from the Anne Murray Centre, which hosts an annual summer event and fundraiser that attracts tourists from around the globe.

Her musical accomplishments in pop, country, and adult contemporary music include albums selling over 55 million copies worldwide. Murray has received four Grammys, a record 24 Junos, three American Music Awards, and three Canadian Country Music Association Awards. The Anne Murray Centre in Springhill offers a mini-recording studio to record your own duet, a gift shop, memorabilia and other artifacts spanning the 40 year music career of Anne Murray.

== Landscape and geology ==

Springhill is located in the Cobequid Mountains sometimes referred to as the Cobequid Hills, which is a mountain range located in Nova Scotia in the mainland portion of the province. Geologically, the Cobequid Mountains are considered part of the Appalachians. The range stretches from Cape Chignecto in Cumberland County in the west through to Pictou County in the east. As a hamlet protruding from the hillsides of Cumberland County, Springhill lies tucked away in the Nova Scotia interior uplands resting between the smooth summit of the Cobequid Mountains and the Bay of Fundy. This craggy and rugged range is a long, narrow remnant of the Atlantic upland, stretching 75 miles across Cumberland County, from the head of the Bay of Fundy to the Northumberland Strait. When seen from a distance, particularly from a high altitude, the flatness of this mountainous range is notably distinct. Broad, rounded summits, ranging in altitude from 850 to 1,000 feet, merge to form a somewhat rolling surface with an average altitude closer to 900 feet. The undulating terrain of Springhill itself is located at approximately 650 feet above sea level and occupies a total land area of only 4 square miles. The hillside terrain has divergent elevations from 400 to 650 feet with discrete panoramic views of the historic lowlands sheltered by towering pines and stands of birch.

The night skies in rural upland Nova Scotia are pure, clear of smog, and brimming with stars. Some of the clearest views of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn can be viewed from high in the Cobequid Hills.

Springhill is located on the northwestern edge of the Cobequid Hills midway between the Minas Basin and the Northumberland Strait. Located in the carboniferous area on the southern side of the Cumberland Coal Basin, Springhill&#x27;s six main coal seams overlap. The seams, separated by strata of sandstone and shale from 11–110 metres in thickness, were once horizontal, but, because they were raised by internal earth movement, now slope sharply down into the earth. The seams dip to the northwest at an angle of thirty-five degrees.

==Coal mining history and legacy==
The first industrial coal mining in the area took place in the 1870s after a rail connection was built by the Springhill and Parrsboro Coal and Railway Company to the newly completed Intercolonial Railway at neighbouring Springhill Junction. Early growth of the coal industry in Nova Scotia was built on exports to the east coast of the United States.

Coal was so prevalent in Springhill that &quot;there was a time when men got coal out of their backyards; shallow pits were found everywhere. In recent years, there have been instances when a homeowner would step out of his door only to find a big gaping hole where his driveway had been. Another part of an old mine had caved in.&quot;

Springhill mining disaster may refer to any of three Canadian mining disasters that occurred in 1891, 1956, and 1958 in different mines within the Springhill coalfield, near the town of Springhill in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. The third and final disaster in 1958 accelerated the closure of the largest mines when what was known as a &quot;bump&quot; occurred. The underground upheaval can be described as a bump due to a seismic jolt stemming from the collapse of one or more support pillars within a mine.

A commemorative monument is prominently displayed on the main street of Springhill to honour the heroic lives of miners and their families. The statue is near to Miner&#x27;s Hall, on the corner of Main and Pioneer Street. A short drive from downtown is the Springhill Coal Mining National Historic Site of Canada. This site is located at the corner of Industrial Park Drive and Memorial Crescent, Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada. Visitor&#x27;s have an opportunity to tour the depths of a Springhill coal mine, hear stories of the disaster of 1891, the 1916 subterranean fire which raged through the galleries, the loss of 39 men in the 1956 explosion and the major “bump” in 1958 which killed 75 men. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who owned CBHT pioneered outside broadcasting in Canada with its coverage of the Springhill Mine Disaster in 1958. The Miners’ Museum displays unique artifacts of the history of the town and its remarkable industrial heritage. There is a gift Shop and picnic area for tourists on the site.

Springhill Mining Disasters are articulated in a number of songs, poems, books and published articles, including an Alistair MacLeod short story entitled, &quot;The Vastness of the Dark&quot;. Blue Grass musician Bill Clifton recorded a song in 1958 called the “Springhill Disaster”. The American folksinger Peggy Seeger and English folksinger Ewan MacColl composed the song &quot;The Ballad of Springhill&quot; about the 1958 Springhill Mining Disaster, subsequently sung by popular folk revival group Peter, Paul and Mary.

In 1987, Irish rock band U2 drew attention to the disaster when they included &quot;The Ballad of Springhill&quot; in the playlist for their Joshua Tree Tour. U2 performed the song at fifteen concerts, and were televised live in 1988. On July 30, 2011, U2 performed the first verse of the song during the final show on their 360° Tour in Moncton, New Brunswick.

==Post-industrial adjustment==
The abrupt end of large-scale industrial coal mining presented incredible economic challenges for the region as residents struggled with massive unemployment in the 1960s. An unexpected legacy and benefit from the abandoned coal mines is being realized in the form of geothermal energy. Since their closure, the mines have filled with ground water which is heated to an average temperature of 18° C (65 °F) by the surrounding earth. Beginning in the late 1980s, this heat source has been exploited by companies located in Springhill&#x27;s industrial park, situated on the land where the surface facilities of the coal mines were located, reducing winter heating bills substantially.

The provincial and federal government offered economic development assistance and a federal medium-security penitentiary, the Springhill Institution, was built during the late 1960s in an effort to diversify the Springhill economy. Nova Scotia Community College, operates their Cumberland Campus in the community of Springhill and offers academic upgrading, post-secondary education courses and trades training in a number of disciplines. Other companies, such as lead–acid battery manufacturer Surrette Battery and Benjamin Heating Products continue to operate in the community. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have a detachment in Springhill and serve the surrounding communities. The All Saints Springhill Hospital operated under the Nova Scotia Health Authority provides health services to Springhill and surrounding areas including Oxford, Collingwood, Southampton and Springhill Junction.

==Municipal governance==

On March 4, 2014, the town&#x27;s elected council, under the leadership of Mayor Max Snow, announced the decision to give up the municipal incorporation charter for the Town of Springhill effective April 1, 2015. The council stated that the decision was arrived at because the municipality, incorporated in 1889, was facing unprecedented future financial pressures in the form of rising costs for services, salaries and pension obligations, most notably for its municipal police department. At the same time, the municipality was facing a future of decreased revenue due to declining property tax assessments while at the same time having the highest municipal property tax rate in Nova Scotia. Upon dissolution, Springhill became part of the Municipality of the County of Cumberland, comprising approximately 1/5 of the population of that municipality. The decision was criticized by some residents who alleged a lack of consultation by the town council. However, the decision was also supported by other residents as a good choice.

== Springhill Fencebusters baseball==
Baseball and coal mining can be linked together in Nova Scotia history since the early 1900s. The development of both professional players and colliery leagues in many Nova Scotia communities came from a need for both recreation and a distraction from the hardships of life in a mining town. Baseball reinforced a cohesiveness between young and old and often brought management and laborers together. During the heyday of Nova Scotia baseball, the Famed Springhill “Fencebusters” included many great sporting moments by pioneer players like &quot;Buddy&quot; Condy, Al Linkletter, Edgar “The Great” Cormier, Leo MacDonald and notable pitchers like Phillip Lloyd “Lefty” Legere. This baseball tradition has been carried forward through a living history project and the coaching of Jim “Pokey” Melanson. Following his death, a ball field was named in his honour.

==Cumberland Trail ==

“The Great Trail” or Trans-Canada Trail System includes an arm of the Cumberland Trail stretching from “The Junction” at Fisher Road passing northwest of Springhill near Lisgar and Queen Street near Springhill Lion&#x27;s Park and traveling southwest toward Lagoon Road. This leg of multi-use trail travels southwest toward Parrsboro passing Newville and Gilbert Lakes. Local trails are groomed and maintained for approximately 200 kilometres between the Trans-Canada Highway and Southampton in Winter months and actively used by the Cumberland County Snowmobile Club. The Cobequid Off-Highway Vehicle Club also uses and maintains trails near Springhill, Nova Scotia.

The Springhill Centennial Golf Club is located at 2770 Pleasant Valley Road. Facilities are in operation from May to October. The course offers 9-hole, par 36, 3000 yd., a large driving range, a putting green, as well as a large clubhouse that was originally a farm house.

The Dr. Carson and Marion Murray Community Centre in Springhill has an arena with an NHL sized ice surface and seating capacity of 800. There are five dressing rooms, a room for officials, lobby, storage facilities, canteen with kitchen, coatroom, meeting/boardroom, walking track, 3,100 square foot common room, and a teen centre. The Naz MacDonald Walking Trail is a 1.8 km outdoor walking trail in that circles the park adjacent to the community centre. This fitness trail provides an opportunity to experience the beauty of various species of shrubs and flowers of the park.

==Transportation==
Springhill is south of the Via Rail station in Springhill Junction. It is a stop on request station along the route of the &quot;Ocean&quot; which runs between Montreal and Halifax. Springhill is 1 hour and 52 minutes driving distance from the Provincial Capital of Halifax, NS, and approximately 45 minutes from Moncton, New Brunswick. Nearby Amherst is a 20-minute drive and Parrsboro is approximately 35–40 minutes from Springhill along Route 2.

<doc id="247654" wikidata="Q7868403" url="?curid=247654" title="USS Clifton Sprague">
<text>USS &quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; (FFG-16) was an guided missile frigate of the United States Navy, the tenth ship of that class. She was named for Vice Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague (1896–1955), hero of the Battle off Samar action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where he received the Navy Cross. &quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; (FFG-16) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy. She was transferred to the Turkish Naval Forces in 1997 as TCG &quot;Gaziantep&quot; (F 490) and remains in active service.

==History==
Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, &quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; was laid down 30 July 1979, launched 16 February 1980, and commissioned 21 March 1981.

&quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; was part of the forces during Operation Urgent Fury, the US led 1983 Invasion of Grenada. The frigate served as the clandestine mother ship for a pre-invasion reconnaissance team of Navy SEALs and Air Force combat controllers. Prior to D-Day on 25 Oct., the 20-man commando force twice attempted to use small boats launched from the frigate to reach a new airport under construction on Grenada&#x27;s southwest coast. Their nighttime attempts to make an assessment of its military defenses and the condition of its uncompleted runway were frustrated both times by rough seas, equipment failures and bad luck.

In July 1993, the guided-missile cruiser and &quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; participated in a passing exercise (PASSEX) with three Russian ships, cruiser , destroyer &quot;Admiral Kharlamov&quot; and the replenishment ship &quot;Dnester&quot;. This was noteworthy because the two navies had an adversarial relationship for decades prior to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.

&quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; was part of the flotilla for Operation Uphold Democracy, the September 1995 US intervention in Haiti.

She was decommissioned on 2 June 1995 at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and was stricken from the US Navy register on 4 September 1997 after being transferred to Turkey.

==TCG &quot;Gaziantep&quot; (F 490)==
She was transferred to Turkey on 27 August 1997 as that nation&#x27;s TCG &quot;Gaziantep&quot; (F 490), and then immediately modified into a G-class frigate by the Turkish Naval Yard.

==Awards==
&quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; and her crew received the following unit awards, according to the US Navy unit awards website:
* Navy E Ribbon, 1 October 1980 to 30 September 1981

* Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, 16 September 1994 to 24 September 1994, Operation Uphold Democracy Haiti
* Meritorious Unit Commendation, 11 September 1994 to 31 March 1995, Operation Uphold Democracy Haiti
* National Defense Service Medal for service during the Gulf War era
&quot;Clifton Sprague&quot; was also nominated for the United States Public Health Service Outstanding Unit Citation for operations from 24 June 1994 to 12 July 1994, but did not receive the award. This was around the time that many refugees were fleeing Haiti in small boats.

<doc id="247655" wikidata="Q474178" url="?curid=247655" title="Bridgewater, Nova Scotia">
<text>Bridgewater is a town in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, Canada, at the navigable limit of the LaHave River. With a 2021 population of 8,790, Bridgewater is the largest town in the South Shore region.

Priding itself as &quot;The Main Street of the South Shore,&quot; Bridgewater has long been established as the primary commercial and professional service centre in the southern half of the province. The community boasts a diverse local economy, as well as larger national and international employers.

== History ==
The original inhabitants of the Bridgewater area are the Mi&#x27;kmaq people who have lived in the area for thousands of years based on artifacts that have been discovered in the town. Prior to European settlement, the Mi&#x27;kmaq used the area where the town now stands as an inland encampment on the edge of the LaHave River.

In 1604 French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons visited the area, and in the mid-1600s there was a small French settlement downriver of the current site at LaHave. The first bridge was built around 1825, and by 1850 the village had a population of 300. Lots were first surveyed in 1874.

Around this time industries were developed using water power from the river, including lumber manufacture, a carding mill, a foundry, a gristmill and a tannery. As the town expanded, it made it more and more difficult for the area&#x27;s Mi&#x27;kmaq inhabitants to maintain their historic way of life.

From 1889 the town was connected by rail to Middleton, and eventually to the rest of the province and Canada via mergers with the Halifax and Southwestern Railway. Passenger service ended in 1976. The railway station, a local landmark, was burned in 1986 and is now the site of fast food outlets. Freight service ended in the early 1990s. 

In January 1899 a fire devastated the downtown core. One month later, the town was incorporated.

A lumber mill started by Edward Doran Davison on the site of the present-day South Shore Shopping Centre was in operation during the first two decades of the 1900s.

A major employer in the 1900s was the Acadia Gas Engines company, the largest marine inboard motor manufacturer in Canada. Their two-stroke engines, manufactured entirely in Bridgewater and nicknamed make and break engines, were exported worldwide. Employing over 100 at the King Street plant, the company declined and closed in the 1970s.

In 1971 Michelin opened a tire factory, eventually employing more than 1,000.

The western bank of the LaHave River was the area first settled, and continued to be the commercial and civic heart of the town well into the 20th century. However, since the 1970s, population and economic growth has been stronger on the eastern bank, with the development of shopping malls, new housing, and a regional hospital.

== Geography ==
Bridgewater spans the width of the LaHave River Valley and is dominated by hills that lead down to the river. Elevations range from 5 m above sea level at the river, to nearly 110 m at the southwestern border. Like much of Southern Nova Scotia, the surrounding area is characterized by rolling drumlins formed during the last glacial period, some of which reach 150 m above sea level. The LaHave River is traversed by two bridges in the centre of the town, as well as a 103 highway overpass and foot bridge towards the northern limits.

===Climate===

Like most of eastern Canada, Bridgewater experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb). The South Shore&#x27;s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean does serve to moderate the climate, and the region is usually milder than most of Canada during the winter months. Nevertheless, winters are generally cold, damp, and snowy, along with frequent rain. Summers, while less extreme than inland central Canada, are warm to hot and sometimes humid, accented by occasional storms and showers. Autumn and spring are often wildly unpredictable, and snowfall in October and May is not unheard of.

Because it lies inland from the ocean, Bridgewater is usually warmer than coastal Nova Scotia during the summer, reporting far fewer foggy days.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bridgewater had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, the average age was 46.8 years, over three years above the provincial average. 54% of the population was female, nearly 3% above the provincial average. 5.2% of residents declared themselves as immigrants, with most having arrived in Canada before 1981. Mother tongue was primarily English, with 1.4% reporting French, and 2.7% other. 7.8% were bilingual in French and English.

== Economy ==

Michelin is by far the town&#x27;s largest employer. Other major sectors are a call centre, retail, and healthcare.

In 2015, the average household income was $46,836, almost $14,000 below the provincial average.

== Arts and culture ==
While Bridgewater is known more as a centre of commerce and industry, it does offer a number of cultural events. These include the annual Bridgewater Garden Party, Christmas on the LaHave, the Growing Green Sustainability Festival, and the Afterglow Art Festival. Founded in 1891, The South Shore Exhibition is the town&#x27;s largest event, attracting some 50,000 people each July. Known locally as &quot;The Big Ex,&quot; the week-long agricultural fair hosts the International Ox Pull, bringing together teams from the Maritimes and the Northeastern United States. The Exhibition also features a midway, carnival games, food, alcohol, animal exhibits, and musical acts.

Community music has been a fixture in the town for many years, including the Bridgewater Fire Department Band, active since 1868. The South Shore Chorale, a seventy-voice mixed chorus, was founded in the 1960s, and for many years, the now-defunct Hospital Chorus and Drama Society helped to raise funds for the Dawson Memorial Hospital (later South Shore Regional Hospital) through its production of Broadway-style musicals.

Art Happening was established in 2014 to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater. Inspired by the &#x27;Art Hive&#x27; movement in Montreal, a group of community members developed a free/low cost art building focused on creativity for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms.

Like much of Lunenburg County, many of Bridgewater&#x27;s residents trace their lineage to the Foreign Protestants who arrived in Nova Scotia in the 18th century. While much of that original culture has been lost, a few remnants remain. Lunenburg pudding, a type of pork sausage, is widely available, and some residents still speak in Lunenburg English, an accent featuring one of the few non-rhotic speech patterns remaining in Canada.

==Sports, parks, and recreation==

Residents of Bridgewater enjoy a relatively extensive parks system, which the town estimates at . This, however, does not include open green space within the town, the inclusion of which would give a much higher total.

The crown jewel of the parks system continues to be the Woodland Gardens, locally known at the &quot;Duck Pond.&quot; This park includes the DesBrisay Museum, one of the town&#x27;s public swimming pools, a large pond and various trails. Shipyards Landing is a large public park located at the reclaimed site of the former Acadia Gas Engine Company. Situated on south King Street along the LaHave River, the area features berthing for boaters and kayakers, picnic and open space, and is often used as a gathering point for festivals, such as Canada Day on the LaHave.

Other parks include Pinecrest and Glen Allen playgrounds, Riverview Park, King Street Court and Pijinuiskaq Park, located in the heart of the downtown. 8 kilometers of the Centennial Trail run through the town, constructed on abandoned rail lines.

Older recreational facilities include the Bridgewater Memorial Arena (opened in 1949 and closed in 2015), the Bridgewater Curling Club, the Kinsmen Field and the Bridgewater Tennis Club, and multiple softball, baseball, and soccer fields.

After a long period of stagnation, the 21st century has seen recreation facilities undergo a prolonged expansion.

In 2008, construction began on the HB Studios Sports Centre, a $1.7 million indoor turf, track, and amenities facility located on Glen Allan Drive.

In 2013, Bridgewater and Municipality of Lunenburg teamed up to construct the multi-purpose Lunenburg County Lifestyle Centre (LCLC) on North Park Street. This facility includes the Clearwater Seafoods Arena with a 1,200-person seating, capacity, the Bank of Montreal Aquatic Centre, and the Margaret Hennigar Public Library. Around the same time, the Bridgewater Marina opened near the former Port of Bridgewater location on the east side of the LaHave River.

In July 2017, the town opened the South Shore Vet Dog Zone (an off-leash dog park) at Generations Active Park near HB Studios Sports Centre.

In the summer of 2018, after years of planning and design work, the Bridgewater Skate Park opened on York Street in Bridgewater, backed by funding contributions from the Town of Bridgewater, Municipality of the District of Lunenburg, and the Province of Nova Scotia.

==Government==

=== Policing ===
The Bridgewater Police Service has moved towards a community based policing model, working closely with Neighbourhood Watch programs and local schools, as well as adding foot and bicycle patrols in areas that squad cars are unable to reach.

The Bridgewater Police Service is governed by the Bridgewater Police Commission. This is made up of both political and citizen appointees. The current chair of the Board of Police Commissioners is Citizen Representative and former mayor, H. David Walker.

=== Planning ===
In 2013, Bridgewater Town Council released the Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan (DWMP) to guide the development of Downtown Bridgewater over the next few decades. In 2019, the Town of Bridgewater&#x27;s Planning Department absorbed the Parks, Recreation, and Culture arm of the town&#x27;s operations and was rebranded as the Department of Community Development.

== Education and health ==
The town is primarily served by Bridgewater Elementary and Junior High School, both located on York Street. Located at the northern edge of town, Park View Education Centre serves grades 10-12 and takes part in the International Baccalaureate program. Along with serving Bridgewater, it also acts as a collector school for students from the rural areas of the county. Centre Scolaire de la Rive-Sud in Cookville offers a primarily French-language education to Francophone families in the area as part of Nova Scotia&#x27;s Acadian school system. The Lunenburg campus of the Nova Scotia Community College is located on High Street, sharing space with the YMCA.

The town has two provincial museums, The DesBrisay and the Wile Carding Mill, as well as a central library.

According to the 2016 census, of the town&#x27;s population ages 25–64, 15.0% had not received a high school diploma while 61.7% had received at least some sort of post secondary degree or certificate. Both figures were slightly worse than the average for Nova Scotia (12.2% and 64.2%, respectively), but significantly better than Lunenburg County (16% and 60.3%) and neighbouring Queens County (20.2% and 51.8%).

Bridgewater is served by the South Shore Regional Hospital, located on Glen Allen Drive. Inaugurated in 1988, the facility replaced the 1960s-era Dawson Memorial Hospital located on the southwestern side of the town. The SSRH serves as the major hospital in the county and offers most standard services.

== Media ==
Bridgewater is served by CKBW-FM radio, CJHK-FM, the South Shore Breaker, and LighthouseNOW. Established in 1947, CKBW-FM has shifted its music focus several times over the past two decades, and now airs classic hits music. CJHK-FM began operating in 2010 as a sister-station to CKBW, and airs country music. The South Shore Breaker is owned by SaltWire Network and produces a weekly newspaper. The weekly LighthouseNow Progress Bulletin (formerly Bridgewater Bulletin) has been in publication since 1888 and has won numerous awards for its content and lay-out.

==Transportation==

Since 2008, Bridgewater has supported Active Transportation, which guides policy and infrastructure. The goal is to promote human-powered means of transport as a safe part of everyday life.

Provincial Highway 103 links Bridgewater with Halifax and Yarmouth via two exits, with another under construction. Trunk highways 10 and 3 meet at Bridgewater, and other provincial routes include 325 and 331.

As the town continues to grow, traffic flow and congestion is of great concern. As Lunenburg County&#x27;s biggest center of employment and commerce, Bridgewater also sees a large influx of daytime traffic. The town&#x27;s geography and two bridge crossings within town limits can amplify traffic disruption when construction work forces the closure of one of the main routes.

A public transit pilot operation began in 2017, and was made permanent in 2019 due to use exceeding expectations. The town&#x27;s bus route runs through residential areas and popular destinations once per hour, six days per week. Feasibility studies into public transit between Bridgewater, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay have occurred but have not yet resulted in service.

There is no freight or passenger rail service.

Historically, the LaHave River was a primary transportation route, although today it is mainly used for recreational boating. The LaHave cable ferry is the only crossing downriver from Bridgewater.

<text>Mahone Bay is a town on the northwest shore of Mahone Bay along the South Shore of Nova Scotia in Lunenburg County. A long-standing picturesque tourism destination, the town has recently enjoyed a growing reputation as a haven for entrepreneurs and business startups. The town has the fastest growing population of any municipality in Nova Scotia according to the 2016 census, experiencing 9.9% population growth.

== History ==
The end of glaciation began 13,500 years ago and ended with the region becoming largely ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation.

The Town of Mahone Bay is part of the Mi’kma’ki territory of the Mi’kmaq who have inhabited their traditional lands for over 13,500 years. Prior to arrival of the Europeans, Mi’kmaw lived in and around what is now Mahone Bay. Indian Point, just outside the town, was an important summertime settlement where the Mi’kmaq could enjoy the sheltered waters and plentiful food sources. In the winter, they would move inland from the coast using the rivers that flow into Mahone Bay harbour. There are many Mi’kmaq who live in the area today.

British officials placed public notices in Germany, southern France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands stating that those willing to move to their planned settlement in Nova Scotia would receive grants of land, food for a year, and a few farm animals. Between 1750 and 1752 more than 2,200 such “Foreign Protestants” made the long journey from Europe to Halifax.

In 1753, most of the new immigrants were brought from Halifax to 
Lunenburg, which was to be the centre of the planned settlement. The first to arrive were those who lived in town of Lunenberg and had farm lots throughout the peninsula, including Mahone Bay. They arrived under the leadership of mariner Ephraim Cook. The people who settled on the Lunenburg Peninsula, including the present-day village of Mahone Bay, were foreign protestants who were German, Swiss, and Montbéliardais settlers.

During the French and Indian War, there were nine Native and Acadian (Catholic) raids against the protestant settlers on the Lunenburg Peninsula. One such raid – the Raid on Lunenburg (1756) – happened just off the shores of Mahone Bay on present-day Covey Island and [John] Rous Island.

Another raid happened on 24 August 1758 in the village of Mahone Bay, when eight Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. While they killed three people in the raid, the Mi&#x27;kmaq were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French.

Mills were established at the mouth of each of Mahone Bay&#x27;s two rivers and over the decades a separate community evolved at Mahone Bay with blacksmiths, merchants, a large school, churches, and shipyards.

=== Shipbuilding ===
Mahone Bay&#x27;s boat building history begins with the Mi’kmaq. The Mi’kmaq were built birch bark canoes. The British began the first industrial production of ships. They established sawmills to produce lumber for shipbuilding. The earliest official registration form found for a vessel built in Mahone Bay dates from 1817. By 1850, at least 43 vessels had already been built by small shipyards in the Mahone Bay area and larger shipyards began being established to build mainly schooners and other smaller vessels, primarily for fishing and moving goods. As years passed, the trend was to build larger vessels for longer distance trading with the United States, West Indies, and elsewhere.

By the end of WWI, there was no longer much demand for sailing vessels so the local shipyards began designing and building power vessels that used engines instead of sails for fishing and moving goods (including rum-running). Shipyards continued producing vessels during WWII. During this period, as many as 500 people were employed in Mahone Bay shipyards.

Although fishing vessels were still being built until 1967, after WWII the industry transitioned to mainly constructing pleasure boats. Fibreglass sailboats were built on the site of the present RPS Composites factory located at 740 Main Street, under several different company names, including Paceship Yachts. The final days of commercial boat building concentrated on the building of pleasure crafts. Mahone Bay Plycraft Co. built thousands of laminated plywood “runabout” boats from 1949 to 1962. Commercial shipbuilding in the Town of Mahone Bay wrapped up around 1975, when the last fibreglass yachts were built at Paceship.

World Wars I and II brought brief revivals of shipbuilding with construction of schooners, tugboats and barges. After the war, the shipyard became known for innovative production of moulded plywood boats. Later on, Paceship Yachts and McVay Fiberglass Yachts built fibreglass sailboats, such as the Paceship 20, designed in 1970.

There were six major shipyards that produced between 1850 – 1942: Obed H. Ham Yacht Works, Abraham Ernst/ Erst &amp; Sons/ Ernst Shipbuilding, John Zwicker, John Mclean and Sons Shipyard, Elkanah Zwicker/ Titus Langilee, Henry Schnare.&quot;

== Today ==
The town is also known for a history of wooden boat building, it was the main industry of Mahone Bay in its earlier years. The Mahone Bay Museum explains and shows this history in detail. Until recent years the town&#x27;s shipbuilding and boat-building heritage was celebrated by the &quot;Mahone Bay Wooden Boat Festival&quot;.

The view across the harbour is of three prominent churches: St James&#x27; Anglican; St John&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran; and Trinity United. It has become an iconic image of Nova Scotia, frequently photographed and featured on postcards and calendars. The town has a number of upscale shops and restaurants which almost universally are designed to appeal to the tourist trade, and sometimes shut down during the winter months. The town also has a plastics factory.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mahone Bay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Government==
The Town of Mahone Bay is governed by a Council composed of a mayor and six councillors elected at-large. The mayor is David DeVenne. Day-to-day activities are managed by a chief administrative officer (CAO) who is accountable to Council. Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 17, 2020. The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.

Municipal Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including directly delivered and shared or regional services. Directly delivered services include services such fire, public works, roads, as well as the municipally owned and operated electrical and water utilities. The municipality participates in shared services, such as library services and policing. The town&#x27;s municipal operating budget was $2.7 million, and the town owned electric light utility of $1.9 million and water utility of $575 thousand resulted in a total proposed budget of $5.2 million in the 2017/18 fiscal year.

Mahone Bay is represented by one riding in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and shares representation with one riding in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons.

<doc id="247659" wikidata="Q7430894" url="?curid=247659" title="Schaefer Beer">
<text>Schaefer Beer is a brand of American beer first produced in New York City during 1842 by the F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Company. The company relocated to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. It went public in 1968 with a $106 million stock offering.

In order to expand capacity for regional sales and fend off competition from national brands, Schaefer began construction of a large modern brewery in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania (near Allentown) that same year. Known as the Lehigh Valley Plant, it opened in 1972. In 1974, it was expanded from its original 1.1 million barrels-per-year capacity to 2.5 million, and then enlarged again in 1975 to over 5 million barrels.

In both the 1950 and 1970 rankings Schaefer Beer was one of the top selling beers in the US, ranking as high as fifth. Though it was producing more than twice as much beer in 1980, the gap between it and the top national brands was dramatically widening. In 1981, the Schaefer family sold the company to the Stroh Brewery Company.

Stroh&#x27;s then took over the Allentown plant in its own bid for national market share. It operated the plant until the company was absorbed by Pabst Brewing Company in 1999. When Pabst divested its facilities and opted to become a &quot;virtual brewer&quot;, it sold the plant to Diageo just two years later. In 2008, Diageo sold it to the Boston Brewing Company, the brewer of Samuel Adams beer.

Pabst retained the license to Schaefer, and as of 2021 outsourced a reformulated brew it labels &quot;Schaefer&quot; and sells in niche markets in the United States.

==History==

==Advertising campaigns==
The advertising slogan for Schaefer beer is the jingle &quot;Schaefer is the one beer to have when you&#x27;re having more than one.&quot; An earlier advertising campaign from the 1950s asserted, &quot;What do you hear in the best of circles? Schaefer, all around!&quot; In Spanish, Schaefer&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Es la mejor, cuando se toma mas de una!&quot; (&quot;It is the best, when you are having more than one!&quot;)

Schaefer had major exhibitions at both of New York City&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fairs, held in Flushing Meadows Park. During both the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Schaefer sponsored &quot;Schaefer Center&quot;, a restaurant that used beer as an ingredient in many dishes.

Schaefer was the official beer sponsor of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1951 until the franchise&#x27;s departure for Los Angeles following the 1957 season. During that span, one of its advertisement was featured at the top of Ebbets Field&#x27;s scoreboard on the right-field wall. The letters &quot;h&quot; or the first &quot;e&quot; on the wordmark lit up depending on whether the official scorer ruled that a batter reached base on a hit or an error, respectively.

Foxboro Stadium, the home stadium of the New England Patriots from 1971-2001, was originally named Schaefer Stadium after the beer company paid naming rights for the privilege, one of the earliest known examples of a stadium selling naming rights. After 12 years, the contract expired and the name was changed to Sullivan Stadium in 1983 (after the family that owned the team).

During the 1970s and 1980s, Schaefer was one of the top selling beers in Puerto Rico and Guam. A large and quite famous Schaefer beer billboard was once displayed at the main entrance to the city of Bayamón. Schaefer still holds the record for being the beer with the most unit sales in Puerto Rico, 13 million cases in a year, in 1979-80. It became well known among Puerto Rican salsa fans.

<text>The Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident, the Meilidao Incident, or the &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot; incident, was a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 10 December 1979 during Taiwan&#x27;s martial law period.

The incident occurred when &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot;, headed by released political prisoner Shih Ming-teh and veteran opposition legislator Huang Hsin-chieh, and other opposition politicians held a demonstration commemorating Human Rights Day to promote and demand democracy in Taiwan. At that time, the Republic of China was a one-party state under the Kuomintang, called &quot;Dang Guo&quot;, and the government used this protest as an excuse to arrest the main leaders of the political opposition. 
The Kaohsiung Incident is widely regarded as a seminal event in the post-war history of Taiwan and the watershed of the Taiwan democratization movements. The event had the effect of galvanizing the Taiwanese community into political actions and is regarded as one of the events that eventually led to democracy in Taiwan.

== Background ==

From 1949 until the 1990s, Taiwan was effectively a one-party state under the rule of the Kuomintang (KMT). During the late 1970s many opponents of the KMT seeking democracy gradually organized themselves as an opposition camp, following the establishment of the magazine &quot;Taiwan Political Review&quot; by Kang Ning-hsiang in 1975. These opponents called themselves &quot;Tangwai&quot;, literally meaning &quot;outside the party&quot;. In its fifth edition on 27 December 1976 it published an article entitled &quot;Two States of Mind – An Evening Discussion with Fou Cong and Professor Liou&quot; which resulted in the revocation of the publisher&#x27;s license. In the 1977 election, Tangwai expanded support significantly and won more seats than ever before. The outcome of the election demonstrated the potential of Tangwai as a quasi-opposition party to the ruling KMT and laid the ground for the ensuing mass movement.

On 16 December 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter announced that the U.S. would sever its official relationship with the Republic of China as of 1 January 1979. It was the most serious challenge to the Taiwan government since it lost its seat at the United Nations to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1971. President Chiang Ching-kuo immediately postponed all elections without a definite deadline for its restoration. Tangwai, which had won steadily expanding support, was strongly frustrated and disappointed about Chiang&#x27;s decision since it suspended the only legitimate method they could use to express their opinions.

Tangwai leader Huang Hsin-chieh and his comrades soon petitioned the KMT government for the restoration of elections, but were rebuffed. On 21 January 1979, the KMT arrested Yu Teng-fa, another Tangwai leader, and his son with the intentional false accusation of propagandising for the Chinese Communist Party. Tangwai regarded the arrest of Yu as a signal of complete suppression and decided to make a last-ditch effort by holding radical demonstrations on the street, resulting in the escalating conflict between the conservative KMT and Tangwai. On 20 April, the government impeached Magistrate Hsu Hsin-liang for participating the historical first democratic rally in the Martial law period.

In May 1979, &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot; was established by Huang Hsin-chieh with Hsu as the director aiming at consolidating Tangwai membership. On 16 August 1979, the first edition was published under the title &quot;Joint Promotion of the New Generation&#x27;s Political Movements&quot;. The initial issue sold out all of its 25,000 copies, the second and third issues sold almost 100,000 copies, and the fourth issue sold more than 110,000. Nonetheless, Hsu&#x27;s magistracy position was revoked by the government in 29 June, and he went exile to U.S. on 30 September. On 17 October 1979, a meeting of 22 Kuomintang security agencies adopted a proposal to ban the magazine after a protest from the South Korean Embassy over an article in the second issue titled &quot;Unveil the Myth of the Korean Economic Miracle&quot; (揭發韓國經濟奇蹟的神話). In November and early December, the southern command of Taiwan Garrison Command abetted 6 cases of local mafia members smashing the offices of the Formosa Magazine and Huang&#x27;s residence in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung with one employee injured by axe, allegedly by Lieutenant general Chang chi-hsiu (). Tangwai held many public gatherings and protests, without official permission. The KMT response was limited, such as sending police in riot gear but not suppressing the gatherings. This low-level reaction gave Tangwai confidence in its own power and it stuck to the radical approach.

== Gushan Incident ==
The magazine&#x27;s Kaohsiung service center applied for a permit to hold a human rights forum on 10 December 1979 at an indoor stadium, and after that was denied it applied for a permit to hold the event at the Rotary Park (扶輪公園), which was also denied. In response, it was decided to hold the demonstration at the Kaohsiung headquarters.

On 9 December 1979, the Kaohsiung branch of &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot; dispatched two campaign wagons to broadcast the &quot;Human Rights Forum&quot;. The wagons were held up by police and two volunteers were arrested and beaten, which roused Tangwai and its supporters to protest at the Gushan branch of Public Security Bureau. This incident caused many outraged Tangwai members and supporters who had not planned to attend the forum the next day to do so.

The event on 10 December 1979 started out as the first major Human Rights Day celebration on the island. Until that time the authorities had never allowed any public expression of discontent.

Between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. that afternoon (four hours before the demonstration commemorating Human Rights Day started, and before any irregularities had taken place), the military police, the army, and the police had already taken up positions when the demonstrators arrived.

When the event took place during the evening, the military police marched forward and closed in on the demonstrators, then they retreated again to their original position. This was repeated two or more times. The battalion commander explained that the purpose of this exercise was to cause panic and fear in the crowd and also to provoke anger and confusion. Political demonstrators clashed with troops sent by the KMT.

== Arrests and imprisonment ==
The KMT authorities used the incident as an excuse to arrest virtually all well-known opposition leaders. They were held incommunicado for some two months, during which reports of severe ill-treatment filtered out of the prisons. The arrested groups were subsequently tried in three separate groups.

=== Lin family massacre ===
In February 1980, Lin Yi-hsiung, a leader of the democratic movement, was in detention and beaten severely by KMT police. His wife, Fang Su-min, saw him in prison and contacted the Amnesty International Osaka office. The next day, Lin&#x27;s mother and twin 7-year-old daughters were stabbed to death in his home, while his oldest daughter was badly wounded. The authorities claimed to know nothing about it, even though his house was under 24-hour police surveillance.

=== Major groups ===
In March–April 1980, the eight most prominent leaders &quot;The Kaohsiung Eight&quot; were tried in military court and were sentenced to terms ranging from 12 years to life imprisonment. The trial was also publicized.

In April–May 1980, another group of 33 people, &quot;The Kaohsiung 33&quot;, who had taken part in the Human Rights Day gathering were tried in civil court and sentenced to terms ranging from two to six years.

===Others===
A third group of 10 people were associated with the Presbyterian Church for hiding Shih Ming-teh, who feared torture and immediate execution. Most prominent among this group was Kao Chun-ming, the general-secretary of the Presbyterian Church. Kao was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The others received lesser sentences. Shih was given a life sentence, and his wife, Linda Gail Arrigo, a United States citizen, was deported.

Fifteen of Taiwan&#x27;s most important political leaders, writers and intellectuals, all associated with the &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot;, were arrested. Fifteen publications were closed down, including &quot;Meilidao&quot; &quot;(Formosa Magazine)&quot;. After the event, newspapers reported that the ensuing confrontations led to civilian and police injuries.

After the incident, four Tangwai participants were arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of sedition, including Huang Hsin-chieh, Yao Chia-wen, Chang Chun-hung and Lin Hung-hsuan.

== News reports ==
Mainstream media had long been controlled by the authoritarian KMT government. The contemporary domestic newspapers were biased about the Kaohsiung Incident and framed it as a violent mass event. &quot;China Times&quot;, &quot;United Daily News&quot;, and KMT-owned &quot;Central District News&quot; also incorrectly stated that the Tangwai protesters were motivated by a pro-independence mindset. It also stated that they were working to subvert the Republic of China in cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. Such news reports caused negative public opinion. This negative public opinion was used by the media as further proof to attack and condemn the Tangwai.

The incident caused international attention around the world, which pressed the KMT government to hold an open trial on the accused. Even though there were pressures from the U.S. and reports from the international media such as &quot;New York Times&quot;, the mainstream Taiwanese media refuted what the larger international media reported as biased rumors regarding the incident.

== Legacy ==
The time period experienced a rising middle class, and a more open-minded Kuomintang (KMT) ruling regime that allowed some fostering of political opposition. Taiwanese citizens were becoming weary of mainlander authority, and were eager for a more democratic society. The event turned into a series of political protests that led to public trials and arrests. It is considered a turning point for pro-democracy groups/anti-KMT political opposition.

After the Kaohsiung incident, a decade of political struggle continued between the mainlander-controlled KMT and the other political parties. The importance of the incident is that both Taiwanese people in Taiwan as well as the overseas Taiwanese community were galvanized into political actions. The movement which grew out of the incident formed the basis for the present-day governing Democratic Progressive Party. While political opposition at the time was not yet calling for Taiwanese independence, the event called for self-determination. An overseas support network of Taiwanese organizations was also formed in North America and Europe. Virtually all leading members of the present-day democratic government had a role in the event, either as defendants or as defense lawyers. By 2000, DPP successfully ended KMT rule. After losing the 2008 and 2012 presidential and legislative elections to the KMT, the DPP successfully contested and won both elections in 2016.

Chen Shui-bian, who was later elected to two terms as ROC president, was one of the defence lawyers, while his running mate, Annette Lu, was one of the &quot;Kaohsiung Eight&quot;. She was sentenced to 12 years, of which she served five and a half.

<text>The Yellow Turban Rebellion, alternatively translated as the Yellow Scarves Rebellion, was a peasant revolt during the late Eastern Han dynasty of ancient China. The uprising broke out in 184 CE, during the reign of Emperor Ling. Although the main rebellion was suppressed by 185 CE, it took 21 years for full suppression of resistant areas and emerging rebellions by 205 CE. The weakening of the imperial court and the rising political influence of ultra-autonomous regional military-governors, who helped suppress the rebellion, eventually led to rampant warlord dominance and the resultant Three Kingdoms period.

The rebellion, which got its name from the color of the rebels&#x27; headwear ( &quot;jīn&quot;, defined as more of a scarf than the turban of South Asia) marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebel leaders&#x27; association with the then secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

==Causes==
By 184 CE, the Han Dynasty&#x27;s central government was weakened by court eunuchs abusing their power over the emperor to enrich themselves. Twelve of the most powerful eunuchs were referred to as the Ten Attendants with Emperor Ling once claiming that &quot;Regular Attendant Zhang Rang is my father and Regular Attendant Zhao Zhong is my mother&quot;. The government corruption was perceived as causing plagues, natural disasters, and poor agricultural yields, reflecting that the emperor had lost his Mandate of Heaven.

As flooding along the Yellow River forced farmers and military settlers south, the labor surplus incentivized exploitation. Disease outbreaks were reported in 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185 CE, with the potential cause theorized as the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180CE of smallpox or measles spreading along the Silk Road.

Through claims of providing curative water and bamboo playing, the Taoist leader Zhang Jue developed his initial following to send his disciples throughout northern China in preparation for a revolt. Their rapid rise was relatively unnoticed until they became too powerful to challenge. Zhang Jue intended to launch an uprising throughout the Han Empire, but the plan was betrayed before he was ready. Rebel sympathizers in Luoyang were arrested and executed, forcing a premature beginning in March 184. Despite the inevitable lack of co-ordination and overall preparation, tens of thousands of men rose in rebellion. Government offices were plundered and destroyed and the imperial armies were immediately forced on the defensive.

==Rebels==
===Founders===
The rebellion was led by Zhang Jue (also referred to as Zhang Jiao, known to his followers as the &quot;General of Heaven&quot;) and his two younger brothers Zhang Bao () and Zhang Liang (), who were born in Julu Commandery. The brothers had founded a Taoist religious sect in present-day Shandong, praised as healers who offered free care to impoverished patients. Recognizing how the local government abused the peasant class through harsh labor and heavy taxes, they plotted rebellion.

===Taoist sect===
The rebels were the first followers of the Way of Supreme Peace () and venerated the deity Huang–Lao, who according to Zhang Jue, had given him a sacred book called the &quot;Crucial Keys to the Way of Peace&quot; () based on the &quot;Taipingjing&quot;. Zhang Jue, who was said to be a sorcerer, called himself the &quot;Great Teacher&quot; (). When the rebellion was proclaimed on 4 March, Zhang Jue created a 16-word slogan spread through the brothers&#x27; medical work: 
===Religious practices===
Zhang Jue claimed to cure patients by having them confess sins for Taoist faith healing. The Zhang brothers believed in an impending apocalyptic change in the &quot;jiazi&quot; year, the beginning of the new sexagenary cycle, involving yellow skies marking new governance, which inspired the color of their headwear. Through the sect&#x27;s communal activities like trances, fasting, musical performances, chanting, incense burning, and sermons, followers united across ethnic and gender lines. Several Xiongnu leaders, such as Yufuluo, lent their support, potentially inspiring Zhang Jue to adopt their shamanistic beliefs.

Despite few surviving records, the early Path of Supreme Peace was likely similar to the Way of the Celestial Masters, considering that Zhang Jue claimed to be a descendant of Zhang Daoling. Much of the &quot;Taipingjing&#x27;s&quot; surviving 52 chapters, found in the &quot;Daozang&quot;, have a direct relationship to the Way of the Celestial Masters with discrepancies potentially suppressed by later Taoists.

==Zhang Jue&#x27;s plans for rebellion==

Before the rebellion started, Zhang Jue had sent Ma Yuanyi () to recruit followers from Jing and Yang provinces and gather them in Ye. Since Ma Yuanyi frequently traveled to Luoyang, the Han imperial capital, he was able to persuade Feng Xu () and Xu Feng (), members of the imperial court&#x27;s eunuch faction, to secretly collaborate with Zhang Jue. They set 3 April 184 as the date for the rebellion, but before the plans was set in motion, the Yellow Turbans were betrayed. One of the founders of &quot;The Way of Peace&quot; movement, Tang Zhou () had been excluded from later planning, so he reported Ma Yuanyi to the authorities. Ma Yuanyi was arrested and executed by dismemberment in Luoyang.

After Emperor Ling learned that Zhang Jue was plotting a revolt, he ordered Zhou Bin (), Prefect of the Palace Parks (), to conduct an investigation and capture all the conspirators. Hundreds of people were arrested and executed during this time.

==Yellow Rebellion==
When Zhang Jue heard that the Han government had learned about his plans to rebel, he quickly sent messengers to contact his allies throughout China and take action immediately. In March, Zhang Jue started the Yellow Turban Rebellion with roughly 360,000 followers wearing yellow headscarves or turbans. He called himself the &quot;Lord General of Heaven&quot; (), while his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were called the &quot;Lord General of Earth&quot; () and &quot;Lord General of People&quot; (), respectively. The rebels attacked government offices, pillaged villages, and seized control of commanderies. Within 10 days, the rebellion had spread throughout China, alarming the Han imperial court in Luoyang.

The rebels were mostly concentrated in the Ji, Jing, You and Yu provinces. The group led by Zhang Jue and his brothers gained their support in Ji Province, located just north of the Yellow River, near Zhang Jue&#x27;s home territory of Julu Commandery (around present-day Pingxiang County, Hebei) and Wei Commandery (around present-day Handan, Hebei). A second major uprising took place in Guangyang Commandery (around present-day Beijing) and Zhuo Commandery (around present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei) in You Province. The third centre of the rebellion was in Yingchuan Commandery (around present-day Xuchang, Henan) and Runan Commandery (around present-day Xinyang, Henan) in Yu Province, and Nanyang Commandery (around present-day Nanyang, Henan) in northern Jing Province.

On 1 April 184, Emperor Ling appointed his brother-in-law He Jin, the Intendant of Henan (), as General-in-Chief () and ordered him to supervise the imperial armies in suppressing the rebellion. Emperor Ling also appointed three generals – Lu Zhi, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun – to lead three separate armies to deal with the rebels with a total of roughly 40,000 troops. Lu Zhi went for Zhang Jue&#x27;s base in Ji Province, while Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun headed to Yingchuan Commandery.

===You Province: Guangyang and Zhuo commanderies===
In You Province, the rebels killed Guo Xun (), the provincial Inspector, and Liu Wei (), the Administrator of Guangyang Commandery.

Zou Jing, a colonel, led imperial forces to eliminate the rebels in You Province. Liu Bei led a group of volunteers to assist him.

===Yu Province: Runan and Yingchuan commanderies===
When the rebellion first broke out in Yu Province, the Han imperial court specially selected Wang Yun to be the inspector of the province to oversee the military operations.

Zhao Qian (), the administrator of Runan Commandery, led his troops to attack the rebels before Zhu Jun arrived, but was defeated at Shaoling (; in present-day southeastern Henan). When Chen County (; present-day Huaiyang County, Henan) was under attack by the rebels, seven of Zhao Qian&#x27;s subordinates, who were non-military personnel, armed themselves with swords and attempted to fight the rebels but were all killed. Later, after the rebellion was suppressed, Emperor Ling issued an edict to honor the seven as the &quot;Seven Virtuous&quot; ().

Chen State (; around present-day Zhoukou, Henan), one of the commanderies in Yu Province, avoided the Yellow Turban Rebellion&#x27;s bloodshed because the rebels feared Prince Liu Chong, famous for his unit of skilled archers.

The rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Bo Cai (), initially defeated Zhu Jun in battle and drove him back. The imperial court sent a cavalry commandant, led by young officer Cao Cao (), as reinforcements for Zhu Jun. Sometime between 28 May and 25 June, Zhu Jun, Huangfu Song, and Cao Cao joined forces to defeat Bo Cai at Changshe (; east of present-day Changge, Henan). While Bo Cai attempted to flee, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun pursued him to Yangzhai County (陽翟縣; present-day Yuzhou, Henan) and defeated him again, causing the rebels to scatter.

Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun then defeated the rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Peng Tuo (), at Xihua County (; south of present-day Xihua County, Henan). The imperial court ordered them to split up: Huangfu Song would attack the rebels at Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day Puyang County, Henan), while Zhu Jun would attack the rebels at Nanyang Commandery. During this time, Wang Yun, the Inspector of Yu Province, found evidence that the rebels had been secretly maintaining contact with Zhang Rang (), the leader of the eunuch faction in Luoyang, so he reported it to Emperor Ling, who scolded Zhang Rang but did not punish him.

Between 7 November and 6 December, Bao Hong (), a colonel, led imperial forces to attack the rebels in Gebei (; northwest of present-day Xincai County, Henan) and defeated them.

===Ji Province: Wei and Julu commanderies===
In the meantime, Lu Zhi defeated Zhang Jue&#x27;s rebel forces in Julu Commandery and besieged the rebel leader in Guangzong County (; southeast of present-day Guangzong County, Hebei). However, after a eunuch falsely accused Lu Zhi of treason, Emperor Ling ordered his arrest, escorted back to Luoyang as a prisoner. The imperial court then sent General Dong Zhuo to take over Lu Zhi&#x27;s position and attack Zhang Jue. However, Dong Zhuo failed and retreated.

On 23 or 24 September, Huangfu Song and Fu Xie (), a Major under him, defeated the rebels at Cangting (; north of present-day Yanggu County, Shandong), captured their leader Bu Ji (卜己), and killed over 7,000 rebels, including other minor leaders Zhang Bo () and Liang Zhongning (). On 25 September, the imperial court ordered him to replace Dong Zhuo and lead his troops north to Guangzong County and attack Zhang Jue.

Zhang Jue died of illness in October 184 while under attack by Huangfu Song in Guangzong County. Between 21 November and 20 December, Huangfu Song kept attacking Zhang Liang, who had taken over command of his brother&#x27;s followers at Guangzong County. Unable to defeat Zhang Liang&#x27;s skilled Yellow Turbans, Huangfu Song switched to a defensive approach, tricking the rebels into lowering their guard for a devastating nighttime strike. Zhang Liang was killed in action alongside 30,000 rebels, while another 50,000 rebels drowned while attempting to flee across a river. Huangfu Song burnt over 30,000 carts containing rebel supplies and captured most of their family members. Huangfu Song then had Zhang Jue&#x27;s body excavated and decapitated, sending his head to the imperial court in Luoyang.

In recognition of Huangfu Song&#x27;s achievements, Emperor Ling promoted him to Left General of Chariots and Cavalry (). Between 21 December 184 and 18 January 185, Huangfu Song joined forces with Guo Dian (), the Administrator of Julu Commandery, to attack the remaining rebels led by Zhang Jue&#x27;s other brother, Zhang Bao. They defeated the rebels at Xiaquyang County (; west of present-day Jinzhou, Hebei), killed Zhang Bao, and received the surrender of over 100,000 rebels.

===Jing Province: Nanyang Commandery===
On 24 March 184, the rebels led by Zhang Mancheng () killed Chu Gong (), the Administrator of Nanyang Commandery, and occupied the commandery&#x27;s capital, Wancheng (; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Chu Gong&#x27;s successor, Qin Jie (), rallied local forces in Nanyang Commandery to attack Zhang Mancheng and defeated and killed him between 26 June and 25 July, before Zhu Jun&#x27;s reinforcements arrived.

After Zhang Mancheng&#x27;s death, Zhao Hong () became the new rebel leader in Wancheng. During or after October 184, Qin Jie and Zhu Jun combined forces with Xu Qiu (), the Inspector of Jing Province, to attack Wancheng with an army of about 18,000. They defeated and killed Zhao Hong.

Following Zhao Hong&#x27;s death, Han Zhong () and the remaining rebels seized control of Wancheng, continuing to resist imperial forces. Zhu Jun ordered his troops to pretend to attack from the southwest, while he secretly led 5,000 elite soldiers to infiltrate Wancheng from the northeast. Han Zhong retreated into the citadel and requested to surrender. Qin Jie, Xu Qiu and Zhang Chao (), a Major under Zhu Jun, all urged Zhu Jun to accept Han Zhong&#x27;s surrender, but he refused. Zhu Jun instead pretended to lift the siege to lure Han Zhong to come out and attack. Han Zhong fell for the ruse, lost the battle, and tried to flee north while some 10,000 of his men were slaughtered by imperial forces. In desperation, Han Zhong surrendered to Zhu Jun, but Qin Jie had him executed.

On 11 January 185, Zhu Jun defeated another rebel force led by Sun Xia (), who then fled towards Xi&#x27;e County (; north of present-day Nanyang, Henan). Zhu Jun pursued him there, defeated him and caused the remaining rebels to disperse.

===Xu and Yang provinces===
In Xu Province, the provincial Inspector Tao Qian, with the aid of Zang Ba, managed to defeat the rebels to restore regional peace.

Sun Jian, then a minor official serving in Xiapi County (; south of present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu) in Xu Province, came to join Zhu Jun&#x27;s army as a Major. He brought along several young men from Xiapi County and other soldiers recruited from the Huai River region.

In Yang Province, the rebels attacked Shu County (; in present-day central Anhui), a county in Lujiang Commandery (; around present-day Lu&#x27;an, Anhui), and set fire to buildings. Yang Xu (), the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery, successfully rallied thousands of able-bodied men aged 19 and above for countering the attack and firefighting.

===End of the rebellion===
By the beginning of 185, the rebellion had mostly been suppressed following Zhu Jun&#x27;s recapture of Wancheng in Nanyang Commandery and Huangfu Song&#x27;s victories over the Zhang brothers in Ji Province. The remaining, scattered rebels were pursued by government forces in smaller military campaigns, and by mid-February 185, Emperor Ling issued a celebratory proclamation by changing his era name from Guanghe () to Zhongping (; &quot;pacification achieved&quot;).

==Resurgent Yellow Turban activities after early 185==
Although the main Yellow Turban Rebellion ended by February 185, smaller rebellions by Yellow Turban remnants continued over the following two decades.

===White Wave Bandits===
Between 16 March and 13 April 188, Guo Tai () led some 100,000 Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Xihe Commandery (around present-day Fenyang, Shanxi). As they originated from Baibo Valley (白波谷; &quot;White Wave Valley&quot;) in Xihe Commandery, they later became known as the &quot;White Wave Bandits&quot; (白波賊). They allied with the Xiongnu leader Yufuluo and attacked Taiyuan Commandery (around present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Hedong Commandery (around present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi). Between 27 October and 25 November 189, when the bandits attacked Hedong Commandery, the warlord Dong Zhuo&#x27;s attempt at sending his son-in-law Niu Fu to lead attacking troops failed.

Around mid-195, Emperor Xian fled from the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an, where he had been held hostage by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, since Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death in 192. He returned to the ruins of the old imperial capital Luoyang, which Dong Zhuo burnt down in 191 while forcefully relocating its residents to Chang&#x27;an. Dong Cheng (a former subordinate of Niu Fu) and Yang Feng (a former White Wave bandit) protected Emperor Xian in Luoyang when Li Jue and Guo Si tried to pursue and bring the emperor back to Chang&#x27;an. Dong Cheng and Yang Feng summoned the White Wave Bandits, led by Li Le (), Han Xian, Hu Cai () and others, to come to Emperor Xian&#x27;s aid. Xiongnu forces led by Qubei also responded to the call and came to help Emperor Xian resist Li Jue and Guo Si&#x27;s forces. Between 195 and 196, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang and escorted Emperor Xian to his own base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new imperial capital there.

===Yi Province: Ma Xiang and Zhao Zhi===
In 188, Ma Xiang () and Zhao Zhi () led Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). They killed Li Sheng (; Prefect of Mianzhu County ), Zhao Bu (; Administrator of Ba Commandery ) and Xi Jian (; Inspector of Yi Province). Ma Xiang declared himself emperor before this sect of the rebellion was suppressed by local forces led by Jia Long (), a former subordinate of Xi Jian.

===Qing Province: Zhang Rao, Guan Hai, Xu He and Sima Ju===
Around 189, Zhang Rao () led some 200,000 Yellow Turban remnants to ravage Qing Province. He defeated imperial forces under Kong Rong, the Han-appointed Chancellor of Beihai State (around present-day Weifang, Shandong) in Qing Province. Later, Kong Rong was besieged in Duchang County (; present-day Changyi, Shandong) by thousands of Yellow Turban rebels led by Guan Hai (). Taishi Ci, then a military officer under Kong Rong, managed to break out of the siege and seek help from Liu Bei, who was then the Chancellor of the nearby Pingyuan State. Liu Bei brought along 3,000 troops to attack Guan Hai and succeeded in saving Kong Rong.

In the 200s, Xu He () and Sima Ju () led Yellow Turban remnants from Jinan Commandery (around present-day Zhangqiu, Shandong) and Le&#x27;an Commandery (around present-day Zibo, Shandong) respectively to ravage Qing Province. They were defeated and killed by Xiahou Yuan, Zang Ba and Lü Qian some time between 206 and 209.

===Yan Province: Cao Cao&#x27;s Qingzhou Army===
Around May 192, hundreds of thousands of Yellow Turban remnants from Qing Province swarmed into Yan Province and killed Zheng Sui (), the Chancellor of Rencheng State (; around present-day Zoucheng, Shandong), before moving into Dongping Commandery (; around present-day Dongping County, Shandong). Liu Dai, the Inspector of Yan Province, wanted to lead his troops to attack the rebels but the general Bao Xin advised him against it. Liu Dai ignored this advice, dying in his attack against the rebels. Bao Xin and another official, Wan Qian (), went to Dong Commandery (; around present-day Puyang, Henan) to invite Cao Cao to be the new Governor of Yan Province. Bao Xin then led government forces to attack the rebels at the east of Shouzhang County (; south of present-day Dongping County, Shandong) but was killed in action. Later, despite having fewer troops, Cao Cao managed to defeat the rebels in Jibei State. The rebels, numbering over 300,000, surrendered to Cao Cao along with their families. Cao Cao then recruited their best warriors and organised them to form an elite military unit, the Qingzhou Army (; also translated as &quot;Qingzhou Corps&quot;).

===Runan and Yingchuan commanderies: He Yi, Liu Pi, Gong Du and others===
In Runan Commandery and Yingchuan Commandery, thousands of Yellow Turban remnants remained active under the leadership of He Yi (), Liu Pi (), Huang Shao (), and He Man (). They were initially allied with the warlords Yuan Shu and Sun Jian, but became an independent force in the 190s. Between 17 March and 15 April 196, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces to attack them and killed Liu Pi, Huang Shao, and He Man. He Yi led the remaining forces in surrendering to Cao Cao.

Other Yellow Turban forces in Runan Commandery were led by Wu Ba () and Gong Du (). Wu Ba was defeated and captured by the general Li Tong. Gong Du posed a threat to Cao Cao when he allied with Cao Cao&#x27;s rival, Liu Bei, and seized control of Runan Commandery in 201. Cao Cao first sent Cai Yang () to eliminate them, but after Cai Yang was killed, he personally led his troops to attack and defeat them. Liu Bei fled south to join Liu Biao, while Gong Du and the remaining rebels dispersed.

===Yang and Jiao provinces===
Another Yellow Turban remnant force was active in Kuaiji Commandery (around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) until Liu Zan killed its leader Wu Huan ().

In the 200s, Chen Bai () and Wan Cheng () started a rebellion in Jiuzhen Commandery (; present-day Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam). In 202, they were defeated and captured by Zhu Zhi, the commandery&#x27;s administrator.

==Aftermath and impact==
The Han armies were victorious, despite the destruction of major government buildings, deaths of high-ranking officials, and fragmentation of the dynasty&#x27;s territory. Rebel deaths numbered in the hundreds of thousands, while many non-combatants had been left homeless or destitute by the wars. However, the heavily weakened Han Dynasty was unable to fully govern, distributing its powers to military commanders and local leaders until its complete collapse by 220 CE.

After Emperor Ling died in 189, a power struggle between his brother-in-law He Jin and the eunuchs culminated in He Jin&#x27;s assassination on 22 September 189. He Jin&#x27;s chief ally, Yuan Shao, retaliated by setting the palace on fire and slaughtering the eunuchs. The warlord Dong Zhuo gained control over the underage heir, Liu Bian, to legitimize his occupation and ransacking of the capital. Dong Zhuo was murdered for his cruelty in 192, allowing the warlord Cao Cao to seize power.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The rebellion is portrayed in the opening chapters of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which portrays the Zhang brothers as sorcerers, having been provided the &quot;Taiping Jing&quot; from the &quot;old immortal spirit from the southern lands&quot; (sometimes identified as Zhuangzi).

Many fictional Yellow Turban figures were created for the novel, including:
* Du Yuan, killed by Liao Hua for kidnapping Liu Bei&#x27;s wives
* Zhou Cang, Guan Yu&#x27;s rebel-turned-weapon bearer
* Gao Sheng, a subordinate of Zhang Bao
* Cheng Yuanzhi, defeated by Liu Bei&#x27;s forces in their first engagement
* Deng Mao, Cheng Yuanzhi&#x27;s champion
* Bian Xi, an eventual servant of Cao Cao who tried and failed to kill Guan Yu

Though not a fictional character, Liao Hua was presented in the novel as having been a Yellow Turban rebel in his earlier days, which is historically unlikely, given his date of death and predicted lifespan.

==In popular culture==
The rebellion appears as an early stage in each iteration of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game franchise, remaining largely unchanged throughout the series. He Yi, Gong Du, and Huang Shao lead playable factions in the Yellow Turban DLC of the turn-based strategy video game &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;, while the Mandate of Heaven DLC features Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao, and Zhang Liang.

<text>Alexander Nasmyth (9 September 175810 April 1840) was a Scottish portrait and landscape painter, a pupil of Allan Ramsay. He also undertook several architectural commissions.

==Biography==
Nasmyth was born in Edinburgh on 9 September 1758. He studied at the Royal High School and the Trustees&#x27; Academy and was apprenticed to a coachbuilder. Aged sixteen, he was taken to London by portrait painter Allan Ramsay where he worked on subordinate parts of Ramsay&#x27;s works. Nasmyth returned to Edinburgh in 1778, where he worked as a portrait painter. Offered a loan by Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, Nasmyth left in 1782 for Italy, where he remained two years furthering his studies. In Italy he devoted most of his attention to landscape painting, and is recorded as having copied a work by Claude Lorrain.

Nasmyth returned to Scotland where for the next few years he continued his career as a portraitist. He painted some works in the style of Ramsay, but most were conversation pieces with outdoor settings. His portrait of Robert Burns, who became a close friend, is now in the Scottish National Gallery. Eventually, Nasmyth&#x27;s strong Liberal opinions offended many of his aristocratic patrons in a politically charged Edinburgh, leading to a falling off in commissions for portraits, and in 1792 he completely abandoned the genre, turning instead to landscape painting. He also began painting scenery for theatres, an activity he continued for the next thirty years, and in 1796 painted a panorama.

His landscapes are all of actual places, and architecture is usually an important element. Some works were painted to illustrate the effects that new buildings would have on an area, such as &quot;Inverary from the Sea&quot;, painted for the Duke of Argyll to show the setting a proposed lighthouse.

Nasmyth had a great interest in engineering, and proposed several ideas that were later widely used, although he never patented any of them. In October 1788, when Patrick Miller sailed the world&#x27;s first successful steamship, designed by William Symington, on Dalswinton Loch, Nasmyth was one of the crew.

He was employed by members of the Scottish nobility in the improvement and beautification of their estates. He designed the circular temple covering St Bernard&#x27;s Well by the Water of Leith (1789), and bridges at Almondell, West Lothian, and Tongland, Kirkcudbrightshire. In 1815 he was one of those invited to submit proposals for the expansion of Edinburgh New Town.

Nasmyth set up a drawing school and &quot;instilled a whole generation with the importance of drawing as a tool of empirical investigation&quot;; his pupils included David Wilkie, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield and John Thomson of Duddingston; and it was probably from him that John James Ruskin (father of John Ruskin) learned to paint as a schoolboy in Edinburgh in the later 1790s. Another successful pupil was the painter, teacher, art dealer and connoisseur Andrew Wilson, who had his first art training under Nasmyth. Nasmyth was not only the tutor to the polymath Mary Somerville but he also introduced her to the leading intellectuals in Edinburgh.

Nasmyth died at home, 47 York Place (roughly opposite the house of Sir Henry Raeburn), in Edinburgh. He was buried in St Cuthbert&#x27;s Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street. The grave lies in the southern section towards the south-west.

==Family==

He married Barbara Foulis, the daughter of Sir James Foulis, 5th Baronet of Colinton, on 3 January 1786.

Nasmyth&#x27;s eldest six daughters all became notable artists. His daughters were Jane, Barbara, Margaret, Elizabeth, Anne and Charlotte. His eldest son, Patrick Nasmyth, studied under his father, then went to London and attracted attention as a landscapist. Another son, James Nasmyth, invented the steam hammer. He had three other children, Alexander, George and Mary.

==Architectural commissions==

Nasmyth obtained several commissions as architect (in terms of a masterplan and artistic concept): notably Rosneath House and Dunglass Castle. In 1810, he designed the Nasmyth Bridge as part of the Almondell Estate, now in the Almondell and Calderwood Country Park.

<text>The Batswana (, singular &quot;Motswana&quot;) are a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa. Ethnic Tswana made up approximately 85% of the population of Botswana in 2011.

Batswana are the native people of south and eastern Botswana and the Gauteng, North West, Northern Cape, Free State, and other provinces of South Africa, where the majority of Batswana are located.

==History==

===Early history===

The Batswana are a Basotho-speaking mega-ethnicity of many kingdoms, who are native to Southern Africa (Parts of modern day Namibia, Botswana and South Africa) alongside the Khwe speaking kingdoms of the same region. The Toutswe were in the eastern region of what is now Botswana, relying on Batswana cattle breeds held in kraals as their source of wealth. The arrival of the ancestors of the Batswana-speaking people who came to control the region (from the Vaal River to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely. Although CE 600 seems to be a consensus estimate, This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 CE or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia, such as beads, made their way to the Batswana. Most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn. 

The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appeared in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas and used their military prowess to raid their neighbors. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. One of these famous capitals was Kaditshwene which was the cultural capital of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Batswana tribes, and a center of manufacturing and trading. it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. 

The remains of another major Batswana settlement, Kweneng&#x27; Ruins, are found in Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve in South Africa. It was occupied from the 15th to the 19th century AD and was the largest of several sizeable settlements inhabited by Setswana speakers before European arrival. Several circular stone-walled family compounds are spread out over an area of 10km long and 2km wide.

===Batswana–Boer Wars===
During the 1840s and 1850s, trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato, and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the Batswapong and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. 

Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852, a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, which culminated in the pivotal showdown of the Battle of Dimawe fought with artillery and long range rifles as well as musket fire. Although it was the Boer Commando led by the Boer Commandant-General Pieter Scholtz and Paul Kruger, as officers leading the Boer advance, who started the offensive, it was they who ended up on the retreat, followed by Batswana&#x27;s retaliatory attacks into the then Transvaal&#x27;s Marique district, in which Boer settlements, villages, and farms were scorched. After about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, they eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed upon, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.

===Battle of Khutiyabasadi===

The Batawana&#x27;s fight against the invading Ndebele of 1884 when the AmaNdebele arrived at Toteng, they found the village abandoned. But, as they settled down to enjoy their bloodless conquest, about seventy mounted Batawana under Kgosi Moremi&#x27;s personal command appeared, all armed with breech-loading rifles. In classic commando style, the cavalry began to harass the much larger enemy force with lethal hit-and-run volleys. Meanwhile, another group of traditionally armed subjects of the Kgosi also made their presence known.

At this point, the AmaNdebele commander, Lotshe, took the bait, dividing his army into two groups. One party pursued Moremi&#x27;s small force, while the other fruitlessly tried to catch up to what they believed was the main body of Batawana.

As the invaders generally lacked guns, as well as horses, Moremi continued to harass his pursuers, inflicting significant casualties while remaining unscathed.

The primary mission of Moremi&#x27;s men was not, however, to inflict losses on the enemy so much as to ensnare them in a well designed trap. His force thus gradually retreated northward towards Khutiyabasadi, drawing the amaNdebele to where the main body of defenders were already well entrenched.

As they approached the swamp area south of Khutiyabasadi, Lotshe struggled to reunite his men, perhaps sensing that they were approaching a showdown. But, instead, Moremi&#x27;s Batawana, now joined by Qhunkunyane&#x27;s Wayeyi, drew the amaNdebele still deeper into the swamps.

In this area of poor visibility, due to the thick, tall reeds, the Batawana and Wayeyi were able to employ additional tricks to lure the invaders towards their ultimate doom. At one point, a calf and its mother were tied to separate trees to make Lotshe&#x27;s men think that they were finally catching up to their main prize, the elusive Batawana cattle. As they pressed forward, the AmaNdebele were further unnerved by additional hit-and-run attacks and sniping by small bands of Batawana marksmen. Certainly, they could not have been comfortable in the unfamiliar Okavango environment.

It was at Kuthiyabasadi that the defenders&#x27; trap was finally sprung. At the time, the place was an island dominated by high reeds and surrounded to the west by deep water. In the reeds, three well armed Batawana regiments, joined by local Wayeyi, waited patiently. There they had built a small wooden platform, upon which several men could be seen from across the channel, as well as tunnels and entrenchments for concealment. The AmaNdebele were drawn to the spot by the appearance of Batawana cavalry, who crossed the channel to the island in their sight. In addition, cattle were placed on a small islet adjacent to Kuthiyabasadi, while a group of soldiers now made themselves visible by standing up on the wooden platform. Also at the location was a papyrus bridge that had been purposely weakened at crucial spots. Surveying the scene, Lotshe ordered his men to charge across the bridge over what he presumably thought was no more than a small stream. As planned, the bridge collapsed when full of AmaNdebele, who were thus unexpectedly thrown into a deep water channel. Few, if any, would have known how to swim.

Additional waves of AmaNdebele found themselves pinned down by their charging compatriots along the river bank, which was too deep for them to easily ford. With the enemy thus in disarray, the signal was given for the main body of defenders to emerge from their tunnels and trenches. A barrage of bullets cut through Lotshe&#x27;s lines from three sides, quickly turning the battle into a one-sided massacre. It is said that after the main firing had ceased, the Wayeyi used their mekoro to further attack the survivors trapped in the river, hitting them on the head with their oars. In this way, many more were drowned. By the time the fighting was over, the blood was reported to have turned the water along the course of the river black. While the total number of casualties at Khutiyabasadi cannot be precisely known, observers in Bulawayo at the time confirmed that over 2,500 men had left on Lotshe&#x27;s expedition and less than 500 had returned. While the bulk of the amaNdebele losses are believed to have occurred in and around Khutiyabasadi itself, survivors of the battle were also killed while being mercilessly pursued by the Batawana cavalry. Moremi was clearly determined to send a strong message to Lobengula that his regiments were no match. Still others died of exhaustion and hunger while trying to make their way home across the dry plains south of Chobe; the somewhat more hospitable route through Gammangwato having been blocked by Khama. While the battle at Khutiyabasadi was a great victory for the Batawana and a defeat for the AmaNdebele, for the Wayeyi of the region, the outcome is said to have been a mixed blessing. While they had shared in the victory over the hated Amandebele, one of its consequences was a tightening of Batawana authority in the area over them as Moremi settled for a period at nearby Nokaneng.

=== First Matabele War ===

The First Matabele War was fought between 1893 and 1894 in modern-day Zimbabwe. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company&#x27;s Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies who marched on Bulawayo from the south commandeered by Khama III, the most influential of the Batswana chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Salisbury and Fort Victoria columns marched into Bulawayo on 4 November 1893. The Imperial column from Bechuanaland was nowhere to be seen. They had set march on 18 October heading north for Bulawayo and had a minor skirmish with the Matabele near Mphoengs on 2 November. They finally reached Bulawayo on 15 November, a delay which probably saved the Chartered Company&#x27;s then newly occupied territory being annexed to the imperial Bechuanaland Protectorate.

=== Bophuthatswana ===

The Bophuthatswana Territorial Authority was created in 1961, and in June 1972 Bophuthatswana was declared a self-governing state. On 6 December 1977 this &#x27;homeland&#x27; was granted independence by the South African government. Bophuthatswana&#x27;s capital city was Mmabatho and 99% of its population was Tswana speaking. In March 1994, Bophuthatswana was placed under the control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana now forms part of the North West, Free State, Northern Cape, and Gauteng provinces.

==Dynasties and tribe==

===Botswana===

The republic of Botswana (formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland) is named for the Tswana people. The country&#x27;s eight major tribes speak Tswana, which is also called Setswana. All have a traditional Paramount Chief, styled &quot;Kgosikgolo&quot;, who is entitled to a seat in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi (an advisory body to the country&#x27;s Parliament). The Tswana dynasties are all related. A person who lives in Botswana is a Motswana and the plural is Batswana. The three main branches of the Tswana tribe formed during the 17th century. Three brothers, Kwena, Ngwaketse and Ngwato, broke away from their father, Chief Malope, to establish their own tribes in Molepolole, Kanye and Serowe, probably in response to drought and expanding populations in search of pasture and arable land.

The principal Tswana tribes are the:
* Kwena tribe
* Mangwato tribe
* Bangwaketse
* Rolong tribe
* Taung tribe
* Batlhaping tribe
* Tlôkwa tribe
* Royal Bafokeng Nation
===South Africa===
The largest number of ethnic Tswana people is located in modern-day South Africa. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, and the Tswana language is one of eleven official languages in South Africa. There were over 4 million Tswana speakers in the country in 2012, with North West Province having a majority of 2,200,000 Tswana speakers. From 1948 to 1994, South African Tswana people were defined by the Apartheid regime to be citizens of Bophuthatswana, one of ten bantustans set up for the purpose of defending the policy of denying black Africans citizenship in South Africa.

==Setswana food and cuisine==
Bogobe is a staple food made from sorghum meal which is often eaten alongside meat or vegetables. The most popular sorghum porridge is Ting. Bogobe jwa Logala/Sengana is a traditional Setswana dish prepared from sorghum porridge mixed/cooked with milk. Seswaa is Botswana&#x27;s national dish and is often served at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. Seswaa is a pounded or shredded meat and often served with Bogobe (Porridge). Madila is a sour cultured milk prepared from cow and goat milk over a period of time until fully matured for consumption. Traditionally madila were prepared using Lekuka a leather sack or bag used in processing and storing madila. Madila is also traditionally used as relish, eaten with pap. It can also be used in popular Tswana breakfast meal, motogo, to give the soft porridge that sour and milky taste.

==Culture and attire==
Batswana wear a cotton fabric known in Setswana as Leteisi and Sotho as Shweshwe. This fabric is often used for wedding celebrations and other traditional celebrations. In Setswana tradition mothers wear mogagolwane, a checkered small blanket during traditional baby-showers, and married women during traditional weddings are identified by it, as well as during various initiation ceremonies. Even during funerals Batswana women don mogagolwane.

==Music==
Tswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums), and phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. Other notable modern Tswana music is Tswana Rap known as Motswako.

==Visual arts==

Batswana are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. Potters made clay pots for storing water, traditional beer and also for cooking and hardly for commercial use. Craft makers made wooden crafts and they made traditional cooking utensils such as leso and lehetlho, traditional wooden chairs and drums among others.
==Tswana astronomy==
Astronomy is an age old tradition in Africa. As with all other cultures, various ethnic groups developed their own interpretations of the solar system. Using their natural instrument the eye, Batswana have observed, commented on and named celestial objects of interest to them. There are more telling and specific names that relate to unique stellar patterns and their seasonal appearance e.g. Selemela, Naka, Thutlwa, and Dikolojwane. According to Tswana culture, the stars of Orion&#x27;s sword were &quot;dintsa le Dikolobe&quot;, three dogs chasing three pigs of Orion&#x27;s belt. The Milky Way was viewed by the Tswana as Molalatladi, the place where lightning rests. It was further believed that this place of rest also kept the sky from collapsing and showed the movement of time. Some even claimed that it turned the sun to the east, in a way to explaining the rising of the sun. It was also believed that it was a supernatural footpath across the sky along which ancestors&#x27; spirits walked. The moon (Ngwedi) is said to represent a woman; it brings forth light but not as scorching as the Sun (Letsatsi) and its light is associated with happiness. Venus is called Mphatlalatsana (the brilliant and blinding one) by Batswana &amp; Kopadilalelo (seeker of evening meals). 

Raditladi Basin, a large peak ring impact crater on Mercury with a diameter of 263 km is named after Leetile Disang Raditladi, a Motswana playwright and poet.

<text>Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading (1579February 1652) was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War and most famously served during the Battle of Newbury and Naseby. He also was involved in the Dutch Revolt and the Thirty Years War. After the second phase of the Civil War, he was imprisoned and then retired in Maidstone. He died shortly after in 1652.

==Life==

He came from an established Norfolk family, and was born at Melton Constable Hall. His first experiences of war were at the age of 18 when he joined the Islands Voyage expedition in 1597 under the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh to the Azores. In 1598 he joined Maurice of Nassau and Henry of Orange in the Netherlands, where he served with distinction in the Dutch Revolt. Afterwards he fought under Frederick V, Elector Palatine and Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He was evidently thought highly of by the States-General, for when he was absent, serving under Christian IV of Denmark, his position in the Dutch army was kept open for him.

In 1622 Astley joined the household of Elizabeth, daughter of James I of England and her husband Frederick, King of Bohemia serving as military tutor to Frederick&#x27;s son Prince Rupert.

Returning to England with a well-deserved reputation, he was in the employment of Charles I in various military capacities. As &quot;Sergeant-Major-General&quot; of the infantry, he went north in 1639 to organize the defence against the expected Scottish invasion. Here his duties were as much diplomatic as military, as the discontent which ended in the Civil War was now coming to a head. He went north again in 1640 as Sergeant-Major-General of the infantry and colonel of the combined Oxfordshire and Berkshire Trained Bands. In the ill-starred Bishops&#x27; Wars, Astley provided service to the king, and he was involved in the so-called &quot;Army Plot&quot;.

At the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 he at once joined Charles, and was made Major-General of the Foot (infantry)—the cavalry was under the command of his former student Prince Rupert. His characteristic battle-prayer at the Battle of Edgehill has become famous: &quot;O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not thou forget me&quot; which he followed promptly with the order &quot;March on, boys!&quot; Both sides&#x27; troops were poorly trained and both sides claimed the battle to be a victory, but the outcome was inconclusive and it would take a further three years of civil war before the Royalists lost to the Parliamentarians.

Astley was loyal supporter of the Crown throughout the First Civil War, while his own region of East Anglia was strongly Parliamentarian. His opposite number in the Parliamentarians was Philip Skippon, another Norfolkman. At Gloucester Astley commanded a division, and at the First Battle of Newbury he led the infantry of the royal army. With Ralph Hopton, in 1644, he served at Arundel and Cheriton. He was not present at Cheriton, although his son, Bernard, probably was, as his regiment of foot was certainly there. At the second Battle of Newbury he made a gallant and memorable defence of Shaw House. He was made a baron by King Charles, and at the Battle of Naseby he once more commanded the main body of the infantry.

He afterwards served in the west, and with 3,000 men fought stubbornly but vainly at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold (March 1646), the last pitched battle of the First Civil War. He surrendered to the Parliamentarians with the words &quot;Well, boys, you have done your work, now you may go and play—if you don&#x27;t fall out among yourselves&quot;.

His scrupulous sense of honour forbade him to take any part in the Second Civil War, as he had given his parole at Stow-on-the-Wold; but he had to undergo his share of the discomforts that were the lot of the vanquished royalists. He was imprisoned initially but able to retire to Maidstone. He died in February 1652. The barony became extinct in 1688.

<text>HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was the Royal Navy&#x27;s lead ship of her class of three light aircraft carriers. She was launched on 3 May 1977 as the seventh ship to carry the name. She was originally designated as an anti-submarine warfare carrier, but was used as an aircraft carrier during the Falklands War, when she was deployed with . She took over as flagship of the British fleet when &quot;Hermes&quot; was sold to India. &quot;Invincible&quot; was also deployed in the Yugoslav Wars and the Iraq War. During the Falklands Conflict, Argentinian media reported &quot;Invincible&quot; as sunk on several occasions. In 2005, she was decommissioned, and was eventually sold for scrap in February 2011.

==Design==
As built, &quot;Invincible&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of at the waterline and at flight deck level, and a draught of at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by four Rolls-Royce Olympus TBM3 gas turbines, with a maximum total continuous power of . These drove two propeller shafts via reversible gearboxes, giving a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at .

&quot;Invincible&quot;″s flight deck was long and wide. It was connected to the ship&#x27;s hangar by two lifts, with dimensions of  × and rated to carry aircraft with a weight of . The hangar itself was long, with width varying between and a height of . An upward-curved ski-jump ramp at an angle of 6.5 degrees was fitted at the forward end of the ship&#x27;s flight deck. This allowed the carrier&#x27;s Sea Harriers to take off with a higher disposal payload, while shortening the take-off run, leaving more space for helicopter operations. The ship had a design air wing of ten Westland Sea King anti-submarine helicopters and eight British Aerospace Sea Harrier STOVL jet fighters.

As built, defensive armament consisted of a twin Sea Dart surface to air missile launcher in the ship&#x27;s bows. 22 Sea Dart missiles were carried. A Type 1022 long-range air-search radar was mounted above the ship&#x27;s bridge, with Type 909 fire control directors for the Sea Dart system mounted at the fore and aft end of the ship&#x27;s superstructure. A Type 992 air-surface search radar was mounted on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, while a Type 1006 navigation radar was also fitted. Type 184 medium range sonar was also fitted.

===Modifications===
In September 1982, after returning from the Falklands War, &quot;Invincible&quot; had her close-in armament supplemented by two Phalanx CIWS and two Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft autocannons.

During 1986–1989, she underwent a major refit, with several changes to increase the ship&#x27;s aircraft operating efficiency. The angle of the ship&#x27;s ski-jump was increased to 12 degrees. Her hangar was modified to allow more aircraft (nine Sea Harriers and twelve Sea Kings) to be accommodated below.
The ship&#x27;s overall length increased to . Additional command facilities were fitted and accommodation for another 120 people (aircrew and command staff) was added. The ship&#x27;s magazines were enlarged, allowing Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles for the carrier&#x27;s Sea Harriers to be carried, while also increasing the number of torpedoes carried for the ship&#x27;s helicopters. Three Thales 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWS replaced the Phalanxes. Type 996 air-sea search radar replaced the Type 992 radar, with Type 2016 sonar replaced the Type 184.

In 2000, &quot;Invincible&quot; was subject to further modifications to allow her to operate Harrier GR.7s in a ground-attack role. The Sea Dart launcher was removed and the ship&#x27;s flight deck was enlarged.

== History ==
&quot;Invincible&quot; was ordered from Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 April 1973, and was laid down at Vickers&#x27; Barrow-in-Furness on 17 April 1973. The ship&#x27;s construction was delayed by design changes and industrial action, and &quot;Invincible&quot; was not launched until 3 May 1977. The ship was launched by Elizabeth II. She was accepted into Royal Navy service on 19 March 1980 and after trials, formally commissioned on 11 July 1980. More trials and work-up followed for the ship and her air wing followed before she was declared operational on 19 June 1981, joining the fleet&#x27;s other carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; in service.

&quot;Invincible&quot;″s initial air wing consisted of 801 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with five Sea Harriers and 820 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Sea King anti-submarine helicopters. In August–September 1981, &quot;Invincible&quot; took part in the NATO naval exercises &quot;Ocean Venture&quot; and &quot;Ocean Safari&quot;.

===Proposed sale and Falklands War===

Pursuant to the plans announced in the 1981 Defence White Paper, on 25 February 1982, after several months of negotiations, the Australian government announced that it had agreed to buy &quot;Invincible&quot; for £175 million (285 million A$) as a replacement, under the name , for the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s . Australia planned to make minimal changes to the carrier, adding more fuel and replacing some of the ship&#x27;s computers. Initially at least, it was planned to operate helicopters only. The sale was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence.

On 2 April 1982, however, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Three days later, a naval task force headed by &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; left HMNB Portsmouth bound for the South Atlantic. On 20 April, the UK government formally ordered its defence forces to bring the islands back under British control. Along with eight Sea Harriers, &quot;Invincible&quot;″s air group included twelve Sea King helicopters that were slightly larger than the ship had originally been designed to accommodate. Small machine guns were added around the flight deck and island for close-in defence.

On 23 April, while en route from Ascension Island to the Falklands, &quot;Invincible&quot; mistakenly locked her Sea Darts on a VARIG Brazilian Airlines DC-10 rather than on the Argentine Air Force Boeing 707 that had been monitoring the fleet&#x27;s movements. The previous day, Task Group Commander Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward had sought permission from Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse to shoot down the 707 as he believed its activity indicated a raid would be launched from the Argentine aircraft carrier . As the 707 would be no direct threat to the fleet, Woodward ordered Weapons Tight and the continued tracking of the aircraft&#x27;s course while a Sea Harrier was dispatched to investigate. The Harrier pilot reported that &quot;it was a Brazilian airliner, with all the normal navigation and running lights on.&quot;

On 30 May, two Dassault-Breguet Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina&#x27;s last remaining air-launched Exocet, accompanied by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two bombs, took off to attack &quot;Invincible&quot;. Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships. When one of the Super Étendards detected a large target on radar, the Exocet was launched, and the Super Étendards turned for Argentina, while the Skyhawks followed the Exocet, which soon passed out of sight. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down by Sea Darts fired by , with HMS &quot;Avenger&quot; claiming to have shot down the missile with her 4.5&quot; gun (although this claim is disputed). No damage was caused to any British vessels. During the war, Argentina claimed to have damaged the ship and continues to do so to this day, although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered.

The aircraft carrier was carrying 10 nuclear depth bombs as part of her standard armament when she deployed for the Falklands, and was one of several Royal Navy warships so equipped during the war. The weapons were removed while she was in the South Atlantic during early May 1982.

On 1 June, the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, advised the British government that the sale of &quot;Invincible&quot; to Australia could be cancelled if desired. In July 1983, a year after the end of the Falklands conflict, the Ministry of Defence announced that it had withdrawn its offer to sell &quot;Invincible&quot; so it could maintain a three-carrier force.

===1983–2005===
In December 1983, &quot;Invincible&quot; was refused the use of dry dock facilities in Sydney when the Royal Navy declined to divulge to the Australian authorities whether or not the ship was carrying nuclear weapons. &quot;Invincible&quot; was accompanied by other ships, including , during this deployment. She then visited Auckland and Wellington in New Zealand.

Between 1993 and 1995, &quot;Invincible&quot; was deployed in the Adriatic for Operation &quot;Deny Flight&quot; and then Operation &quot;Deliberate Force&quot; during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1997, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Alan West, Commander United Kingdom Task Group, &quot;Invincible&quot; led a deployment that included 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. During the following two years, &quot;Invincible&quot; contributed to Operation &quot;Bolton&quot; (part of Operation &quot;Southern Watch&quot;) in southern Iraq before she was redeployed to the Balkans to support the NATO action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo. There, while her helicopters aided refugees, her Harriers were involved in military strikes.

In 2003, &quot;Invincible&quot; featured in a skit of the BBC show &quot;Top Gear&quot; involving The Stig racing a white Jaguar XJS on the deck in an attempt to reach 100 mph and stop before the end of the runway. The attempt failed, resulting in The Stig and the Jaguar ending up in the sea.

===2005–2011===
On 6 June 2005, the British Ministry of Defence announced that &quot;Invincible&quot; would be inactive until 2010 but available for reactivation at eighteen months&#x27; notice. She was decommissioned on 3 August 2005, twenty months after an extensive refit that had been intended to give her ten more years of service. succeeded her as the service&#x27;s flagship. The Royal Navy maintained that &quot;Invincible&quot; could have been deployed had the need arisen and that Navy policy assumed she was still an active aircraft carrier. According to &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;, however, &quot;Invincible&quot; had been stripped of some parts for her sister ships, so operational readiness would require not only eighteen months but also the replacement or removal of systems from those other ships.

In March 2010, &quot;Invincible&quot; was tied up and minimally maintained with other decommissioned ships up-river of HMNB Portsmouth. On 10 September 2010, she was struck off the Naval Reserve List and, in December, offered for sale by the Disposal Services Authority (DSA) with tenders due by 5 January 2011. The DSA tender documents confirmed that the ship&#x27;s engines had been removed and that its generators and pumps were &quot;generally unserviceable or not working&quot;. On 8 January 2011, the British press relayed an earlier report in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; that a £5-million bid had been made for the ship by the UK-based Chinese businessman Lam Kin-bong with plans to moor her at Zhuhai or Liverpool as a floating international school. In light, however, of China&#x27;s re-arming of the &quot;Varyag&quot;bought under a similar pretextand the EU arms embargo on China, doubts were raised as to whether such a sale would go ahead.

A month later, in February 2011, BBC News reported that the Ministry of Defence had announced the sale of &quot;Invincible&quot; to Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey. She was towed out of Portsmouth on 24 March and arrived at Leyal&#x27;s Aliağa yard on 12 April 2011 for scrapping.

== Weapons and aircraft ==
&quot;Invincible&quot; initially lacked any close-in weapon systems. As one of the lessons from the Falklands War &quot;Invincible&quot; had two 20 mm Raytheon Phalanx close-in weapon systems fitted but these were later replaced by three Thales 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWS; there are also two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Countermeasures were provided by a Thales jamming system and ECM system, Seagnat launchers provide for chaff or flare decoys. Initially the carriers were armed with a Sea Dart missile system, but this was removed to enlarge the flight deck and to allow magazine storage and deck space for Royal Air Force Harrier GR7s.

After the various refits, the carrier&#x27;s air group grew from the original planned 5 Sea Harriers and 9 Sea Kings to nine Sea Harrier or Harrier GR7/9s and twelve helicopters (usually all Sea Kings, either anti-submarine warfare (ASW) or Airborne Early Warning (AEW) variants). Alternative airgroups were occasionally tested with 16 Harriers and 3 helicopters being embarked. The carrier was equipped with flagship facilities and could provide an operational headquarters for Royal Navy task forces. The runway was long and included the ship&#x27;s characteristic ski jump (initially at an angle of 7°, but later increased to 12°).

<text>, also known as Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Dreams, is a 1990 magical realist anthology film of eight vignettes written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. Inspired by actual recurring dreams that Kurosawa had, it stars Akira Terao, Martin Scorsese, Chishū Ryū, Mieko Harada and Mitsuko Baisho. It was the director&#x27;s first film in 45 years in which he was the sole author of the screenplay. An international co-production of Japan and the United States, &quot;Dreams&quot; was made five years after &quot;Ran&quot;, with assistance from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and funded by Warner Bros. The film was screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, and has consistently received positive reviews.

&quot;Dreams&quot; addresses themes such as childhood, spirituality, art, death, and mistakes and transgressions made by humans against nature.

==Plot==
The film does not have a single narrative, but is episodic in nature, following the adventures of a &quot;surrogate Kurosawa&quot; through eight different segments, or &quot;dreams&quot;, each one titled.

===&quot;Sunshine Through the Rain&quot;===
A young boy&#x27;s mother tells him to stay at home during a day when the sun is shining through the rain, warning him that &quot;kitsune&quot; (foxes) have their weddings during such weather, and do not like to be seen. He defies her wishes, wandering into a forest where he witnesses the slow wedding procession of the &quot;kitsune&quot;. He is spotted by them and runs home. His mother meets him at the front door, barring the way, and says that an angry fox had come by the house, leaving behind a tantō knife. The mother gives the knife to the boy and tells him that he must go and beg forgiveness from the foxes, refusing to let him return home unless he does so. She warns that if he does not secure their forgiveness, he must take his own life. Taking the knife, the boy sets off into the mountains, towards the place under the rainbow where the &quot;kitsune&quot;″s home is said to be.

===&quot;The Peach Orchard&quot;===
On the spring day of &quot;Hinamatsuri&quot; (the Doll Festival), a boy spots a small girl dressed in pink in his house. He follows her outside to where his family&#x27;s peach orchard once was. Living dolls appear before him on the orchard&#x27;s slopes, and reveal themselves to be the spirits of the peach trees. Because the boy&#x27;s family chopped down the trees of the orchard, the dolls berate him. However, after realizing that the boy loved the blossoms and did not want the trees to be felled, they agree to give him one last look at the orchard as it once was. They perform a dance to &quot;Etenraku&quot; that causes the blossoming trees to re-appear. The boy sees the mysterious girl walking among the blooming trees and runs after her, but she and the trees suddenly vanish. He walks sadly through the thicket of stumps where the trees had been, until he sees a single young peach tree, in full bloom, sprouting in her place.

===&quot;The Blizzard&quot;===
A group of four mountaineers struggle up a mountain path during a horrendous blizzard. It has been snowing for three days and the men are dispirited and ready to give up. One by one they stop walking, giving in to the snow and sure death. The leader endeavors to push on, but he too, stops in the snow. A strange woman (the Yuki-onna of Japanese folklore) appears out of nowhere and attempts to lure the last conscious man into giving in to his death. He resists, shaking off his stupor and her entreaties, to discover that the storm has abated, and that their camp is only a few meters away.

===&quot;The Tunnel&quot;===
A discharged Japanese company commander is walking down a deserted road at dusk, on his way back home from fighting in the Second World War. He comes to a large concrete pedestrian tunnel, from which a barking and snarling anti-tank dog emerges. The commander walks through the dark tunnel and comes out on the other side. He is followed by the &quot;yūrei&quot; (ghost) of one of his soldiers, Private Noguchi, who had died of severe wounds in the commander&#x27;s arms. Noguchi&#x27;s face appears blue with blackened eyes.

Noguchi seems not to believe that he is dead. Noguchi points to a light emanating from a house on a nearby mountainside, which he identifies as being his parents&#x27; home. He is heartbroken, knowing he cannot see them again, even while he remains respectful to the commander. Following the commander&#x27;s wish that he accept his fate, Noguchi returns into the tunnel.

The commander&#x27;s entire third platoon, led by a young lieutenant brandishing an officer&#x27;s sword, then marches out of the tunnel. They come to a halt and present arms, saluting the commander. Their faces too are colored blue. The commander struggles to tell them that they are dead, having all been killed in combat, and says that he himself is to blame for sending them into a futile battle. They stand mute in reply. The commander orders them to turn about face, and salutes them in a farewell as they march back into the tunnel. Collapsing in grief, the commander is quickly brought back to his feet by the reappearance of the anti-tank dog.

===&quot;Crows&quot;===
An art student finds himself inside the world of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s artwork, where he meets the artist in a field and converses with him. Van Gogh relates that his left ear gave him problems during a self-portrait, so he cut it off. The student loses track of the artist, and travels through a number of Van Gogh&#x27;s works trying to find him, concluding with Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Wheat Field with Crows&quot;.

===&quot;Mount Fuji in Red&quot;===
A large nuclear power plant near Mount Fuji has begun to melt down. The sky is filled with red fumes and millions of Japanese citizens flee in terror towards the ocean. Eventually, two men, a woman, and her two small children are seen alone at the edge of the sea. The older man, who is dressed in a business suit, explains to the younger man that the rest of the population have drowned themselves in the ocean. He then says that the different colors of the clouds billowing across the rubbish-strewn landscape signify different radioactive isotopes. According to him, red indicates plutonium-239, which can cause cancer; yellow indicates strontium-90, which causes leukemia; and purple indicates cesium-137, which causes birth defects. He then remarks about the foolish futility of color-coding such dangerous gases.

The woman, hearing these descriptions, recoils in horror before angrily cursing those responsible and the pre-disaster assurances of safety they had given. The suited man displays contrition, suggesting that he is in part responsible for the disaster. The other man, dressed casually, watches the multicolored radioactive clouds advance upon them. When he turns back towards the others at the shore, he sees the woman weeping: the suit-clad man has leaped to his death. A cloud of red dust reaches them, causing the mother to shrink back in terror. The remaining man attempts to shield the mother and her children by using his jacket to feebly fan away the radioactive billows.

===&quot;The Weeping Demon&quot;===
A man finds himself wandering around a misty, bleak mountainous terrain. He meets an oni-like man, who is actually a mutated human with a single horn on his head. The &quot;demon&quot; explains that there had been a nuclear holocaust which resulted in the loss of nature and animals, towering dandelions taller than humans, and humans sprouting horns. He elaborates that, by dusk, the horns cause them to feel excruciating pain; however, they cannot die, so they simply howl in agony during the night. Many of the &quot;demons&quot; were former millionaires and government officials, who are now suffering through a hell befitting for their sins.

The &quot;demon&quot; warns the man to flee, when the man asks where he should go to, the &quot;demon&quot; asks if he too wants to become a demon. The horrified man then runs away from the scene with the &quot;demon&quot; in pursuit.

===&quot;The Village of the Water Mills&quot;===

A man enters a peaceful, stream-laden village, where he sees children laying flowers on a large stone. He meets an elderly, wise man who is fixing a broken water mill wheel. The elder informs the younger man that residents of the village simply refer to it as &quot;the village&quot;, and that outsiders call it &quot;the village of the water mills&quot;. When the younger man inquires about the lack of electricity in the village, the elder explains that the people of his village decided long ago to forsake modern technology, and laments the notion of modern convenience and the pollution of nature.

The younger man asks the elder about the stone which children were placing flowers on. The elder tells him that, long ago, an ailing traveler died on that spot. The villagers buried him there and placed the rock there as a headstone. Ever since, it has become customary in the village to offer flowers there. The younger man and the elder hear the sounds of a funeral procession for an old woman nearby. Rather than mourning her death, the people in the procession celebrate joyfully the peaceful end of her long life. The elder goes to join the procession, and the younger man leaves flowers on the stone before departing the village.

==Production==
===Writing and finance===
&quot;Dreams&quot; is a series of eight vignettes based on director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s own dreams over the years. According to Teruyo Nogami, the film&#x27;s production manager and Kurosawa&#x27;s longtime collaborator, Kurosawa is the protagonist of each episode, in &quot;one way or another&quot;. Written over the span of two months, it is the first produced screenplay that the director authored himself since 1945&#x27;s &quot;The Men Who Tread on the Tiger&#x27;s Tail&quot;. Assistant director Takashi Koizumi said that work on the screenplay for &quot;Dreams&quot; began in June or July 1986 in Gotemba, Shizuoka. Kurosawa would write from 9a.m. to around 4p.m. At Kurosawa&#x27;s directive, Koizumi wrote a short piece titled &quot;To Fly&quot;, but Koizumi said Kurosawa would completely rewrite everything and make it his own, except for stuff he was bad at; math for example, would be left as is. Koizumi suggested Kurosawa was influenced by Natsume Sōseki&#x27;s &quot;Ten Nights of Dreams&quot;, a book the director liked and in which each story begins with &quot;I had the following dream&quot;. He also gave the director Kunio Yanagita&#x27;s &quot;The Legends of Tono&quot; and C.G. Jung&#x27;s writings on dreams, which might have also been of use. Koizumi stated that he believes the sequences in the film incorporate more from Kurosawa&#x27;s actual memories, than they do his dreams. He specifically mentioned &quot;Sunshine Through the Rain&quot; and how the little boy thinks he has to commit harakiri, and how Kurosawa&#x27;s sister Momoyo was given a posthumous Buddhist name that uses the characters for &quot;peach orchard&quot; is reflected in &quot;The Peach Orchard&quot;.

Despite coming off of the award-winning &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; (1975) and &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Ran&quot; (1985), Kurosawa had trouble financing the film. Rejected by his usual studio Toho, Bilge Ebiri wrote that many in the Japanese film industry knew Kurosawa&#x27;s projects rarely turned a major profit, but also wrote the director knew that the studio heads were concerned about the film&#x27;s &quot;attack on the country&#x27;s nuclear power program.&quot; American director Steven Spielberg, a fan of Kurosawa, helped get the director a deal with Warner Bros., while George Lucas, who previously helped Kurosawa finance &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, had his company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) provide the special effects for &quot;Dreams&quot; at cost. The film is co-produced by Kurosawa&#x27;s son, Hisao, and his nephew, Yasuo &quot;Mike&quot; Inoue. Ishirō Honda served as a creative consultant for the film. There is a misconception that Honda co-wrote or directed &quot;The Tunnel&quot;. In actuality, Kurosawa had him instruct the actors in the segment on how to march and hold their guns due to his experience in the military. Costume designer Emi Wada was aided by Kurosawa&#x27;s daughter, Kazuko.

===Filming===
Filming took place between January and August 1989, as Kurosawa wanted to incorporate as many of the four seasons as possible. Koizumi said Kurosawa liked to rehearse as soon as he arrived on set at 9a.m. He also said the director preferred to shoot single takes if possible. &quot;The Tunnel&quot; has a 16 minute shot, which Kurosawa said must have been a world record considering a single film magazine only lasts 10 minutes, that ended only because lights placed on the backs of the soldiers would have been seen when the platoon does an about-face. Koizumi believes Kurosawa did not need many takes because he would edit the film in his head while shooting it.

For the &quot;Sunshine Through the Rain&quot; segment, the film&#x27;s art director Yoshiro Muraki built a replica of Kurosawa&#x27;s childhood home; the nameplate on the gate even reads &quot;Kurosawa&quot;. During production, Kurosawa showed Mitsuko Baisho, the actress playing the mother, a photo of his own mother, and gave her tips on how to act as her. Nogami and the assistant director had initially thought that masks would work for the fox faces, but they did not at all so they had to use makeup, and Nogami called the makeup the hardest part. Kurosawa personally choreographed the foxes&#x27; movements. While the rainbow in the segment&#x27;s final scene was added by ILM, every one of the artificial flowers was actually planted by the crew. Similarly, the peach petals in &quot;The Peach Orchard&quot; were scattered by hand and are not CGI. &quot;The Blizzard&quot; follows mountaineers who struggle up a mountain. Kurosawa previously confessed to being &quot;a devotee of mountain climbing&quot;. Mieko Harada, who plays the snow woman in the sequence, also appears as an extra in &quot;The Village of the Water Mills&quot; with her infant child on her back.

In &quot;Crows&quot;, Vincent van Gogh is portrayed by American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. When discussing who could play the Dutch painter with Francis Ford Coppola, Kurosawa said Scorsese was the only person who came to mind and asked him via a letter. In their brief prior meeting, Scorsese had expressed ideas to the Japanese director about &quot;saving cinema&quot;, and Kurosawa said that is how he viewed Van Gogh. Scorsese later said he could not say no because it was Kurosawa, and took a break from making &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990) in order to be in &quot;Dreams&quot;. Scorsese&#x27;s scenes were shot in a single day, and Nogami said he was extremely nervous because of how many lines he had. Scorsese himself described how he was given many meticulous instructions, and memorized them all despite his acting skills. Kurosawa was a fan of Van Gogh, both he and his wife liked &quot;The Letters of Vincent van Gogh&quot;, and he personally &quot;touched up&quot; many of the reproductions of his works seen in the exhibition scene. A year before filming, the crew had replanted a barley field with wheat in order to match &quot;Wheatfield with Crows&quot;. About 100 crows captured by locals in Hokkaido were kept in cages hidden in the field on either side of the frame and were released on a cue from Scorsese. According to Koizumi, music the birds are known to dislike was played in order to get them to fly within frame. A few crows were also added digitally. In a reference to the 1923 French film &quot;La Roue&quot;, the segment features Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (&quot;Raindrop&quot;) by Frédéric Chopin. &quot;Crows&quot; is the only segment in the film wherein the characters do not speak Japanese, but instead English and French.

&quot;The Village of the Water Mills&quot; segment was filmed at the Daio Wasabi farm in Nagano Prefecture. The colorful costumes worn by the villagers during a funeral procession are based on unusual clothes that Kurosawa saw in a remote northern village in his childhood. The idea of the stone in this segment, on which passersby lay flowers, was possibly inspired by a similar stone from Kurosawa&#x27;s father&#x27;s home village in Akita Prefecture:
 Nogami said Chishu Ryu struggled to memorize his 8 and a half minutes of dialogue. She explained that although it was later edited into separate pieces, the dialogue was shot in a single take. The segment, and the film as a whole, ends with the director&#x27;s stand-in walking out of the frame as &quot;In the Village&quot; from the &quot;Caucasian Sketches&quot; by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov plays.

===Cancelled sequences===
&quot;Dreams&quot; was initially composed of 11 sequences, but was trimmed down to nine before filming began. Nearly three months into shooting, the ninth sequence was also abandoned. Nogami said this was due to the ninth segment and its on-location shooting in the United States being estimated to cost $3 million of the film&#x27;s $14 million budget. Titled &quot;A Wonderful Dream&quot;, the cancelled final sequence featured &quot;I&quot; having breakfast in a foreign hotel when he hears a loud commotion and turns on the television to see announcers from various countries reveal that humanity has staved off nuclear extinction with a global peace treaty having been signed. He looks out a window to see crowds of people throwing guns and other weapons into a pile while shouting for joy. In a move similar to the fourth wall-breaking scene of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;One Wonderful Sunday&quot; (1947), the film was set to end with the viewing audience being called upon to join in with the applause. Coppola even gave Kurosawa some advice on how to save money for the long shots of crowds by cutting cork into human shapes and placing them in flowing water to simulate jostling and shoving. Nogami said Kurosawa found the idea interesting, but never actually tested it. With the scrapping of &quot;A Wonderful Dream&quot;, &quot;The Village of the Water Mills&quot; segment was moved from sixth place, to the film&#x27;s last. In an interview with Nobuhiko Obayashi, Kurosawa described another sequence he really wanted to make that featured the asura at Kōfuku-ji coming to life and juggling the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kiyomizu-dera and others while its three faces argue with each other, before deciding to watch the moon rise at Mount Wakakusa. But the director said the &quot;issues of the Kyoto temples aren&#x27;t global problems.&quot; Jim Bailey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that another sequence was scrapped due to how much it would cost to use special effects to make people appear to be flying.

==Release==
&quot;Dreams&quot; was screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival on May 10, 1990. It opened in Japanese theaters that same month. The film debuted in New York and Los Angeles on August 24, 1990.

==Critical reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a mostly positive review, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s something altogether new for Kurosawa, a collection of short, sometimes fragmentary films that are less like dreams than fairy tales of past, present and future. The magical and mysterious are mixed with the practical, funny and polemical.&quot;

The Encyclopedia of International Film praised Kurosawa in relation to &quot;Dreams&quot; as having &quot;long been a master of complex narrative. Now he wants to tell what he does.&quot; It praised the editing and staging in the film as &quot;hypnotically [serene]&quot;, and called &quot;Dreams&quot; &quot;one of the most lucid dreamworks ever placed on film.&quot;

Donald Richie and Joan Mellen wrote of the film and of Kurosawa: &quot;Beyond himself, he is beautiful because the beauty is in the attitude of the director. This is evident not only in the didactic approach, but also in the whole slowness, in the quantity of respect and in the enormous, insolent security of the work. That a director in 1990 could be so strong, so serious, so moral and so hopeful, is already beautiful.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;This late-career anthology by Akira Kurosawa often confirms that &quot;Dreams&quot; are more interesting to the dreamer than their audience, but the directorial master still delivers opulent visions with a generous dose of heart.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Dreams&quot; was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on two occasions: one on March 18, 2003, and the other on August 30, 2011, as part of the Warner Archive Collection.

The Criterion Collection released special editions of the film on Blu-ray and DVD on November 15, 2016, in the US. Both editions feature a new 4K restoration, headed by Lee Kline, technical director of the Criterion Collection, and supervised by one of the film&#x27;s cinematographers, Shoji Ueda. Also included in the release is an on-set making-of documentary directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi called &quot;Making of &quot;Dreams&quot;&quot;, which was filmed during its production, and Catherine Cadou&#x27;s 2011 French documentary &quot;Kurosawa&#x27;s Way&quot;. The Criterion edition was released in 4K Blu-ray with HDR in August 2023.

<doc id="247710" wikidata="Q435844" url="?curid=247710" title="Lamoral, Count of Egmont">
<text>Lamoral, Count of Egmont, Prince of Gavere (18 November 1522 – 5 June 1568) was a general and statesman in the Spanish Netherlands just before the start of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, whose execution helped spark the national uprising that eventually led to the independence of the Netherlands.

==Biography==
The Count of Egmont was at the head of one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the Low Countries. Paternally, a branch of the Egmonts ruled the sovereign duchy of Guelders until 1538. Lamoral was born in Château de Lahamaide near Ellezelles. His father was John IV of Egmont, knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. His mother belonged to a cadet branch of the House of Luxembourg, and through her he inherited the title &quot;prince de Gavere&quot;. During his youth, he received a military education in Spain. In 1542, he inherited the estates of his elder brother Charles in Holland. His family&#x27;s stature increased further in 1544 when, at Spires, in the presence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and of the Archduke Ferdinand I, he married the Countess Sabina of Palatinate-Simmern, whose brother became the Elector Palatine Frederick III.
By appointment, he was Captain General of the Lowlands under Charles V, knight of the Golden Fleece from 1546, and Imperial Chamberlain. In the service of the Spanish army, he defeated the French in the battles of Saint-Quentin (1557) and Gravelines (1558). Egmont was appointed stadtholder of Flanders and Artois in 1559, aged only 37.
As a leading Netherlandic nobleman, Egmont was a member of King Philip II of Spain&#x27;s official Council of State for Flanders and Artois. Together with William, Prince of Orange and the Count of Horn, he protested against the introduction of the inquisition in Flanders by the cardinal Antoine Perrenot Granvelle, bishop of Arras. Egmont even threatened to resign, but after Granvelle left, there was a reconciliation with the king. In 1565, running short of funds as he had continued the representation of the Low Countries entirely from his own pocket, Egmont went to Madrid to beseech Philip II, the king of Spain, for a change of policy in the Netherlands, but met with little more than courtesy.
Soon thereafter, the &#x27;Beeldenstorm&#x27; started, the massive iconoclasm of Catholic churches in the Netherlands, and resistance against the Spanish rule in the Netherlands increased. As a devout Catholic, Egmont deplored the iconoclasm, and remained faithful to the Spanish king. Nevertheless, he and Horn opposed the Inquisition which angered Philip.

After Philip II sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands, William of Orange decided to flee Brussels. Having always declined to do anything that smacked of &quot;lèse majesté&quot;, Egmont refused to heed Orange&#x27;s warning; thus he and Horn decided to stay in the city. Upon arrival, Alba almost immediately had the counts of Egmont and Horn arrested on charges of heresy, and imprisoned them in a castle in Ghent, prompting Egmont&#x27;s wife and their eleven surviving children (from the thirteen they had together) to seek refuge in a convent. Pleas for amnesty came to the Spanish king from throughout Europe, including from many reigning sovereigns, the Order of the Golden Fleece (both being knights of the Order, and thereby theoretically immune from trial by any but their peers of the Order), and the king&#x27;s kinsman the Emperor Maximilian II, all to no avail.

==Execution and destruction of Castle Egmond==

On 4 June, Egmont and Horn were condemned to death, and lodged that night in the King&#x27;s House in Brussels. On 5 June 1568, both men were beheaded before the Town Hall on the Grand-Place/Grote Markt (Brussels&#x27;s main square), Egmont&#x27;s uncomplaining dignity on the occasion being widely noted. Their deaths led to public protests throughout the Netherlands, and contributed to the resistance against the Spaniards. 

The Count of Egmont lies buried in Egmont&#x27;s crypt in Zottegem, a Belgian city in which Egmont is remembered by his two statues, his museum and his castle. Egmond Castle in Egmond aan den Hoef was destroyed in 1573 and in 1997 a statue in his memory is erected on the site of the ruins.

A statue erected on the Square du Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavelsquare in Brussels commemorates the Counts of Egmont and Horn, in historical overview usually mentioned together as &quot;Egmond en Hoorne&quot; and hailed as the first leaders of the Dutch revolt, as the predecessors of William of Orange, who grew to importance and obtained the leadership after their execution, and who was assassinated in 1584 in Delft, having succeeded in liberating parts of The Netherlands in the early years of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648).

Egmont&#x27;s offices and vast estates were forfeited upon his execution, escheating to the Prince-Bishop of Liège. By inheritance he had been count of Egmont (or Egmond), prince de Gavre and van Steenhuysen, baron de Fiennes, Gaesbeke and La Hamaide, seigneur de Purmerent, Hoogwoude, Aertswoude, Beyerland, Sottenghien, Dondes, Auxy and Baer. Some of these lands were eventually returned to his heirs by the Bishop, principally in 1600. Despite the taint of treason and the family&#x27;s impoverishment, his niece Louise of Lorraine-Mercœur, was chosen to become the Queen consort of Henry III of France in 1575.

==Literary treatments==
The Count of Egmont is the main character in a play by Goethe, &quot;Egmont&quot;. In 1810, Ludwig van Beethoven composed the Egmont Overture an overture and incidental music for a revival of the play.

<doc id="247712" wikidata="Q622217" url="?curid=247712" title="Universal translator">
<text>A universal translator is a device common to many science fiction works, especially on television. First described in Murray Leinster&#x27;s 1945 novella &quot;First Contact&quot;, the translator&#x27;s purpose is to offer an instant translation of any language.

As a convention, it is used to remove the problem of translating between alien languages when it is not vital to the plot. Especially in science fiction television, translating a new language in every episode when a new species is encountered would consume time normally allotted for plot development and would potentially become repetitive to the point of annoyance. Occasionally, intelligent alien races are portrayed as being able to extrapolate the rules of English from little speech and rapidly become fluent in it, making the translator unnecessary.

While a &quot;universal&quot; translator seems unlikely, scientists continue to work towards similar real-world technologies involving small numbers of known languages.

==General==
As a rule, a universal translator is instantaneous, but if that language has never been recorded, there is sometimes a time delay until the translator can properly work out a translation, as is true of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The operation of these translators is often explained as using some form of telepathy by reading the brain patterns of the speaker(s) to determine what they are saying; some writers seek greater plausibility by instead having computer translation that requires collecting a database of the new language, often by listening to radio transmissions.

The existence of a universal translator tends to raise questions from a logical perspective, such as:
* The continued functioning of the translator even when no device is evident;
* Multiple speakers hear speech in one and only one language (so for example, for a Spanish speaker and a German speaker listening to an Italian speaker the Spanish speaker would only hear Spanish and neither the original Italian nor the translated German, while the German speaker would not hear any Spanish nor Italian but only German);
* Characters&#x27; mouths move in sync with the translated words and not the original language;
* The ability for the translator to function in real-time even for languages with different word order (such as a phrase &quot;the horse standing in front of the barn&quot; would end up in Japanese as 納屋の前に立っている馬, lit. &quot;barn-in-front-at-standing-horse&quot;; however, there is no delay for the Japanese listener even when the English speaker has yet to mention the barn).

Nonetheless, it removes the need for cumbersome and potentially extensive subtitles, and it eliminates the rather unlikely supposition that every other race in the galaxy has gone to the trouble of learning English.

== Fictional depictions ==
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Using a telepathic field, the TARDIS automatically translates most comprehensible languages (written and spoken) into a language understood by its pilot and each of the crew members. The field also translates what they say into a language appropriate for that time and location (e.g., speaking the appropriate dialect of Latin when in ancient Rome). This system has frequently been featured as a main part of the show. The TARDIS, and by extension a number of its major systems, including the translator, are telepathically linked to its pilot, the Doctor. None of these systems appear able to function reliably when the Doctor is incapacitated. In &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot;, when companion Donna Noble attempts to speak the local language directly, her words are humorously rendered into what sounds to a local like Welsh. One flaw of this translation process is that if the language a word is being translated into does not have a concept for it, the word may not be correctly translated or understood. For example, the Romans don&#x27;t have a word or a general understanding of &quot;volcano&quot; as Mount Vesuvius has not erupted yet.

===&quot;Farscape&quot;===
On the TV show &quot;Farscape&quot;, John Crichton is injected with bacteria called translator microbes which function as a sort of universal translator. The microbes colonize the host&#x27;s brainstem and translate anything spoken to the host, passing along the translated information to the host&#x27;s brain. This does not enable the injected person to speak other languages; they continue to speak their own language and are only understood by others as long as the listeners possess the microbes. The microbes sometimes fail to properly translate slang, translating it literally. Also, the translator microbes cannot translate the natural language of the alien Pilots or Diagnosans because every word in their language can contain thousands of meanings, far too many for the microbes to translate; thus Pilots must learn to speak in &quot;simple sentences&quot;, while Diagnosans require interpreters. The implanted can learn to speak new languages if they want or to make communicating with non-injected individuals possible. The crew of Moya learned English from Crichton, thereby being able to communicate with the non-implanted populace when the crew visited Earth. Some species, such as the Kalish, cannot use translator microbes because their body rejects them, so they must learn a new language through their own efforts.

===&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;===
In the universe of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, universal translation is made possible by a small fish called a &quot;babel fish&quot;. The fish is inserted into the auditory canal where it feeds off the mental frequencies of those speaking to its host. In turn it excretes a translation into the brain of its host.

The book remarks that, by allowing everyone to understand each other, the babel fish has caused more wars than anything else in the universe.

The book also explains that the babel fish could not possibly have developed naturally and therefore proves the existence of God as its creator, which in turn proves the non-existence of God. Since God needs faith to exist, and this proof dispels the need for faith, this therefore causes God to vanish &quot;in a puff of logic&quot;.

===&quot;Men in Black&quot;===
The &quot;Men in Black&quot; franchise possess a universal translator, which, as Agent K explains in the first film, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, they are not allowed to have because &quot;human thought is so primitive, it&#x27;s looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.&quot; remarking “That kinda makes you proud, doesn’t it?”

===&quot;Neuromancer&quot;===
In William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, along with the other novels in his Sprawl trilogy, &quot;Count Zero&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, devices known as &quot;microsofts&quot; are small chips plugged into &quot;wetware&quot; sockets installed behind the user&#x27;s ear, giving them certain knowledge and/or skills as long as they are plugged in, such as the ability to speak another language. (The name is a combination of the words &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;, and is not named after the software firm Microsoft.)

===&quot;Star Control&quot;===
In the &quot;Star Control&quot; computer game series, almost all races are implied to have universal translators; however, discrepancies between the ways aliens choose to translate themselves sometimes crop up and complicate communications. The VUX, for instance, are cited as having uniquely advanced skills in linguistics and can translate human language long before humans are capable of doing the same to the VUX. This created a problem during the first contact between Vux and humans, in a starship commanded by Captain Rand. According to &quot;Star Control: Great Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict&quot;, Captain Rand is referred to as saying &quot;That is one ugly sucker&quot; when the image of a VUX first came onto his viewscreen. However, in &quot;Star Control II&quot;, Captain Rand is referred to as saying &quot;That is the ugliest freak-face I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; to his first officer, along with joking that the VUX name stands for Very Ugly Xenoform. It is debatable which source is canon. Whichever the remark, it is implied that the VUX&#x27;s advanced Universal Translator technologies conveyed the exact meaning of Captain Rand&#x27;s words. The effete VUX used the insult as an excuse for hostility toward humans.

Also, a new race called the Orz was introduced in &quot;Star Control II&quot;. They presumably come from another dimension, and at first contact, the ship&#x27;s computer says that there are many vocal anomalies in their language resulting from their referring to concepts or phenomena for which there are no equivalents in human language. The result is dialogue that is a patchwork of ordinary words and phrases marked with *asterisk pairs* indicating that they are loose translations of unique Orz concepts into human language, a full translation of which would probably require paragraph-long definitions. (For instance, the Orz refer to the human dimension as *heavy space* and their own as *Pretty Space*, to various categories of races as *happy campers* or *silly cows*, and so on.)

In the other direction, the Supox are a race portrayed as attempting to mimic as many aspects of other races&#x27; language and culture as possible when speaking to them, to the point of referring to their own planet as “Earth,” also leading to confusion.

In &quot;Star Control III&quot;, the K’tang are portrayed as an intellectually inferior species using advanced technology they do not fully understand to intimidate people, perhaps explaining why their translators’ output is littered with misspellings and nonstandard usages of words, like threatening to “crushify” the player. Along the same lines, the Daktaklakpak dialogue is highly stilted and contains many numbers and mathematical expressions, implying that, as a mechanical race, their thought processes are inherently too different from humans’ to be directly translated into human language.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the universal translator was used by Ensign Hoshi Sato, the communications officer on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, to invent the linguacode matrix. It was supposedly first used in the late 22nd century on Earth for the instant translation of well-known Earth languages. Gradually, with the removal of language barriers, Earth&#x27;s disparate cultures came to terms of universal peace. Translations of previously unknown languages, such as those of aliens, required more difficulties to be overcome.

Like most other common forms of &quot;Star Trek&quot; technology (warp drive, transporters, etc.), the universal translator was probably developed independently on several worlds as an inevitable requirement of space travel; certainly the Vulcans had no difficulty communicating with humans upon making &quot;first contact&quot; (although the Vulcans could have learned Standard English from monitoring Earth radio transmissions). The Vulcan ship that landed during First Contact was a survey vessel. The Vulcans had been surveying the humans for over a hundred years, when first contact actually occurred to T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s great-grandmother, T&#x27;mir, in the episode &quot;Carbon Creek&quot;; however, in &quot;Star Trek First Contact&quot; it is implied that they learned English by surveying the planets in the Solar System. Deanna Troi mentions the Vulcans have no interest in Earth as it is &quot;too primitive&quot;, but the Prime Directive states not to interfere with pre-Warp species. The Vulcans only noticed the warp trail and came to investigate.

Improbably, the universal translator has been successfully used to interpret non-biological lifeform communication (in the &quot;Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;). In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) episode &quot;The Ensigns of Command&quot;, the translator proved ineffective with the language of the Sheliaks, so the Federation had to depend on the aliens&#x27; interpretation of Earth languages. The &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Darmok&quot; also illustrates another instance where the universal translator proves ineffective and unintelligible, because the Tamarian language is too deeply rooted in local metaphor.

Unlike virtually every other form of Federation technology, universal translators almost never break down. A notable exception is in the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;An Obol for Charon&quot;, where alien interference causes the translator to malfunction and translate crew speech and computer text into multiple languages at random, requiring Commander Saru&#x27;s fluency in nearly one hundred languages to repair the problem. Although universal translators were clearly in widespread use during this era and Captain Kirk&#x27;s time (inasmuch as the crew regularly communicated with species who could not conceivably have knowledge of Standard English), it is unclear where they were carried on personnel of that era.

The episode &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was the only time in which the device was actually seen; Spock removes the device that had been installed in a shuttlecraft, modifies so that they can communicate with a non-corporeal alien, using the translator as a hand-held device. In the episode &quot;Arena&quot; the Metrons supply Captain Kirk and the Gorn commander with a Translator-Communicator, allowing conversation between them to be possible. During Kirk&#x27;s era, they were also apparently less perfect in their translations into Klingon. In the sixth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, the characters are seen relying on print books in order to communicate with a Klingon military ship, since Chekov said that the Klingons would recognize the use of a Translator. Actress Nichelle Nichols reportedly protested this scene, as she felt that Uhura, as communications officer during what was effectively a cold war, would be trained in fluent Klingon to aid in such situations. The novelization of that movie provided a different reason for the use of books: the translator had been sabotaged by somebody working on the Starfleet side of the conspiracy in the story, but the novelization is not part of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon. In that same movie, during the trial scene of Kirk and McCoy before a Klingon judiciary, the Captain and the Doctor are holding communication devices while a Klingon (played by Todd Bryant) translates for them. 

By the 24th century, universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by Starfleet personnel, although there were instances when crew members (such as Riker in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;First Contact&quot;) spoke to newly encountered aliens even when deprived of their communicators. In the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;The 37&#x27;s&quot; the device apparently works among intra-species languages as well; after the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew discovers and revives eight humans abducted in 1937 (including Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan) and held in stasis since then, a Japanese Army officer expresses surprise that an Ohio farmer is apparently speaking Japanese, while the farmer is equally surprised to hear the soldier speaking English (the audience hears them all speaking English only, however). Certain Starfleet programs, such as the Emergency Medical Hologram, have universal translators encoded into the programming.

The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; says that the universal translator is an &quot;extremely sophisticated computer program&quot; which functions by &quot;analyzing the patterns&quot; of an unknown foreign language, starting from a speech sample of two or more speakers in conversation. The more extensive the conversational sample, the more accurate and reliable is the &quot;translation matrix&quot;, enabling instantaneous conversion of verbal utterances or written text between the alien language and American English / Federation Standard.

In some episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, we see a Cardassian universal translator at work. It takes some time to process an alien language, whose speakers are initially not understandable but as they continue speaking, the computer gradually learns their language and renders it into Standard English (also known as Federation Standard).

Ferengi customarily wear their universal translators as an implant in their ears. In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;) episode &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, in which the show&#x27;s regular Ferengi accidentally become the three aliens in Roswell, the humans without translators are unable to understand the Ferengi (who likewise can not understand the English spoken by the human observers) until the Ferengi get their own translators working. Similarly, throughout all &quot;Trek&quot; series, a universal translator possessed by only one party can audibly broadcast the results within a limited range, enabling communication between two or more parties, all speaking different languages. The devices appear to be standard equipment on starships and space stations, where a communicator pin would therefore presumably not be strictly necessary.

Since the Universal Translator presumably does not physically affect the process by which the user&#x27;s vocal cords (or alien equivalent) forms audible speech (i.e. the user is nonetheless speaking in his/her/its own language regardless of the listener&#x27;s language), the listener apparently hears only the speaker&#x27;s translated words and not the alien language that the speaker is actually, physically articulating; the unfamiliar oratory is therefore not only translated but somehow replaced. The universal translator is often used in cases of contact with pre-warp societies such as in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Who Watches the Watchers&quot;, and its detection could conceivably lead to a violation of the Prime Directive. Therefore, logically there must be some mechanism by which the lips of the speaker are perceived to be in sync with the words spoken. No explanation of the mechanics of this function appears to have been provided; the viewer is required to suspend disbelief enough to overcome the apparent limitation.

== Non-fictional translators ==
Microsoft is developing its own translation technology, for incorporation into many of their software products and services. Most notably this includes real-time translation of video calls with Skype Translator. As of July 2019, Microsoft Translator supports over 65 languages and can translate video calls between English, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin), Italian, and Spanish.

In 2010, Google announced that it was developing a translator. Using a voice recognition system and a database, a robotic voice will recite the translation in the desired language.
Google&#x27;s stated aim is to translate the entire world&#x27;s information. Roya Soleimani, a spokesperson for Google, said during a 2013 interview demonstrating the translation app on a smartphone, &quot;You can have access to the world&#x27;s languages right in your pocket... The goal is to become that ultimate Star Trek computer.&quot;
The United States Army has also developed a two-way translator for use in Iraq. TRANSTAC (Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use), though, only focuses on Arabic-English translation.
The United States Army has scrapped the TRANSTAC Program and is developing in conjunction with DARPA, the BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) in its place.

In February 2010, a communications software called VoxOx launched a two-way translator service for instant messaging, SMS, email and social media titled the VoxOx Universal Translator.
It enables two people to communicate instantly with each other while both typing in their native languages.

<doc id="247720" wikidata="Q17019867" url="?curid=247720" title="Blonde joke">
<text>Blonde jokes are a joke cycle based on a stereotype of a dumb blonde woman.

These jokes about people, generally women, who have blonde hair serve as a form of blonde versus brunette rivalry. They are often considered to be derogatory as many are mere variants on traditional ethnic jokes or jests about other identifiable groups that would be considered more offensive (such as Italian jokes involving Carabinieri).

In some cases, jokes about stereotypically stupid people have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.

Some blonde jokes rely on sexual humour to portray or stereotype their subjects as promiscuous. Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes.

==Common traits==
Blonde jokes nearly always take the format of the blonde placing herself in a situation or making a comment that serves to highlight her supposed promiscuity and/or lack of intelligence, cluelessness and clumsiness. The blonde of the joke is often placed in an unusual situation with a brunette or redhead.

The emergence of a class of meta-jokes about blondes (&quot;meta-blonde jokes&quot;, i.e., jokes about blonde jokes) is noted. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype. An example is about a blonde objecting to a ventriloquist act packed with sexist jokes about blondes:
The British Essex girl joke, very similar in content, became popular in the late 1980s; it satirises working-class girls from the county of Essex.

==Criticism==
Like all humour based on stereotypes, blonde jokes are considered offensive to many people, particularly blonde women. 

Blonde jokes have been criticized as sexist by several authors, largely because the target is invariably dimwitted, female and sexually promiscuous.

<doc id="247724" wikidata="Q53437" url="?curid=247724" title="Augustus II the Strong">
<text>Augustus II the Strong (12 May 1670 – 1 February 1733), was Elector of Saxony from 1694 as well as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1697 to 1706 and from 1709 until his death in 1733. He belonged to the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.

Augustus&#x27; great physical strength earned him the nicknames &quot;the Strong&quot;, &quot;the Saxon Hercules&quot; and &quot;Iron-Hand&quot;. He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children.

In order to be elected king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece from the Holy Roman Emperor and established the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest distinction. As elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He transformed the Saxon capital of Dresden into a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw. In 1711 he served as the Imperial vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.

His reigns brought Poland some troubled times. He led the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Great Northern War, which allowed the Russian Empire to strengthen its influence in Europe, especially within Poland. His main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth, characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other European monarchies. In order to reduce the autonomy of the Commonwealth&#x27;s subjects he was using foreign powers leading to destabilization of the country. Augustus ruled Poland with an interval; in 1704 the Swedes installed nobleman Stanisław Leszczyński as king, who officially reigned from 1706 to 1709 and after Augustus&#x27; death in 1733 which sparked the War of the Polish Succession.

Augustus&#x27; body was buried in Poland&#x27;s royal Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, but his heart rests in the Dresden Cathedral. His only legitimate son, Augustus III of Poland, became king in 1733.

==Early life==
Augustus was born in Dresden on 12 May 1670, the younger son of John George III, Elector of Saxony and Princess Anna Sophie of Denmark. As the second son, Augustus had no expectation of inheriting the electorate, since his older brother, John George IV, assumed the post after the death of their father on 12 September 1691. Augustus was well educated, and spent some years in travel and in fighting against France.

Augustus married Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth in Bayreuth on 20 January 1693. They had a son, Frederick Augustus II (1696–1763), who succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony and King of Poland as Augustus III.

While in Venice during the carnival season, his older brother, the Elector John George IV, contracted smallpox from his mistress Magdalena Sibylla of Neidschutz. On 27 April 1694, Johann Georg died without legitimate issue and Augustus became elector of Saxony, as Friedrich Augustus I.

==Conversion to Catholicism==
To be eligible for election to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1697, Augustus had to convert to Roman Catholicism. The Saxon electors had traditionally been called &quot;champions of the Reformation&quot;. Christian August of Saxe-Zeitz baptized him and announced his conversion. Saxony had been a stronghold of German Protestantism and Augustus&#x27; conversion was therefore considered shocking in Protestant Europe. Although the prince-elector guaranteed Saxony&#x27;s religious status quo, Augustus&#x27; conversion alienated many of his Protestant subjects. As a result of the enormous expenditure of money used to bribe the Polish nobility and clergy, Augustus&#x27; contemporaries derisively referred to the Saxon elector&#x27;s royal ambitions as his &quot;Polish adventure&quot;.

His church policy within the Holy Roman Empire followed orthodox Lutheranism and ran counter to his new-found religious and absolutist convictions. The Protestant princes of the empire and the two remaining Protestant electors (of Hanover and Prussia) were anxious to keep Saxony well-integrated in their camp. According to the Peace of Augsburg, Augustus theoretically had the right to re-introduce Roman Catholicism (see &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;), or at least grant full religious freedom to his fellow Catholics in Saxony, but this never happened. Saxony remained Lutheran and the few Roman Catholics residing in Saxony lacked any political or civil rights. In 1717, it became clear just how awkward the situation was: to realize his ambitious dynastic plans in Poland and Germany, it was necessary for Augustus&#x27; heirs to become Roman Catholic. After five years as a convert, his son—the future Augustus III—publicly avowed his Roman Catholicism. The Saxon Estates were outraged and revolted as it became clear that his conversion to Catholicism was not only a matter of form, but of substance as well.

Since the Peace of Westphalia, the elector of Saxony had been the director of the Protestant body in the Reichstag. To placate the other Protestant states in the Empire, Augustus nominally delegated the directorship of the Protestant body to Johann Adolf II, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. However, when the Elector&#x27;s son also converted to Catholicism, the electorate faced a hereditary Catholic succession instead of a return to a Protestant Elector upon Augustus&#x27;s death. When the conversion became public in 1717, Brandenburg-Prussia and Hanover attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship and appoint themselves as joint directors, but they gave up the attempt in 1720. Saxony would retain the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, despite the fact that all remaining Electors of Saxony were Catholic.

The wife of Augustus, the Electress Christiane Eberhardine, refused to follow her husband&#x27;s example and remained a staunch Protestant. She did not attend her husband&#x27;s coronation in Poland and led a rather quiet life outside Dresden, gaining some popularity for her stubbornness.

==King of Poland for the first time==

Following the death of Polish King John III Sobieski and having converted to Catholicism, Augustus won election as King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1697 with the backing of Russia and Austria, which financed him through the banker Issachar Berend Lehmann. At the time, some questioned the legality of Augustus&#x27; elevation, since another candidate, François Louis, Prince of Conti, had received more votes. Each candidate, Conti and Augustus, was proclaimed as king by a different ecclesiastical authority: (the Primate Michał Stefan Radziejowski proclaimed Conti and the bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Dąmbski proclaimed Augustus, with Jacob Heinrich von Flemming swearing to the &quot;pacta conventa&quot; as Augustus&#x27;s proxy). However, Augustus hurried to the Commonwealth with a Saxon army, while Conti stayed in France for two months.

Although he had led the imperial troops against the Ottoman Empire in 1695 and 1696 without very much success, Augustus continued the war of the Holy League against Turkey, and during a campaign against the Ottomans, his Polish army defeated a Tatar expedition in the Battle of Podhajce in 1698. Unfortunately on 22 September a conflict between Polish and Saxon troops was narrowly avoided, causing the campaign to end. Victory at Podhajce had the political impact of forcing the Ottoman Empire to return Podolia and Kamieniec Podolski in Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. An ambitious ruler, Augustus hoped to make the Polish throne hereditary within his family, and to use his resources as elector of Saxony to impose some order on the chaotic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was, however, soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest. He formed an alliance with Frederick IV of Denmark and Peter I of Russia to strip the young King Charles XII of Sweden (Augustus&#x27; cousin) of his possessions. Poland&#x27;s reward for participation in the Great Northern War was to have been Swedish Livonia. Charles proved an able military commander, however, quickly forcing the Danes out of the war and then driving back the Russians at Narva in 1700, thereby allowing him to focus on the struggle with Augustus. However, this war ultimately proved as disastrous for Sweden as for Poland.

Charles defeated Augustus&#x27; army at Riga in July 1701, forcing the Polish-Saxon army to withdraw from Livonia, and followed this up with an invasion of Poland. He captured Warsaw on 14 May 1702, defeated the Polish-Saxon army again at the Battle of Kliszów (July 1702), and took Kraków. He defeated another of Augustus&#x27; armies under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Adam Heinrich von Steinau at the Battle of Pułtusk in spring 1703, and besieged and captured Toruń.

By this time, Augustus was certainly ready for peace, but Charles felt that he would be more secure if he could establish someone with whom he had more influence on the Polish throne. In 1704 the Swedes installed Stanisław Leszczyński and tied the commonwealth to Sweden, which compelled Augustus to initiate military operations in Poland alongside Russia (an alliance was concluded in Narva in summer 1704). The resulting civil war in Poland (1704–1706) and the Grodno campaign (1705–1706) did not go well for Augustus. Following the Battle of Fraustadt, on 1 September 1706, Charles invaded Saxony, forcing Augustus to yield the Polish throne to Leszczyński by the Treaty of Altranstädt (October 1706).

Meanwhile, Russia&#x27;s Tsar Peter had reformed his army, and he dealt a crippling defeat to the Swedes at the Battle of Poltava (1709). This spelled the end of the Swedish Empire and the rise of the Russian Empire.

==King of Poland for the second time==
The weakened Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth soon came to be regarded as almost a protectorate of Russia. In 1709 Augustus II returned to the Polish throne under Russian auspices. Once again he attempted to establish an absolute monarchy in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but was faced with opposition from the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;, see Tarnogród Confederation). He was handicapped by the mutual jealousy of the Saxons and the Poles, and a struggle broke out in Poland which was only ended when the king promised to limit the number of his army in that country to 18,000 men. Peter the Great seized on the opportunity to pose as mediator, threatened the Commonwealth militarily, and in 1717 forced Augustus and the nobility to sign an accommodation favorable to Russian interests, at the Silent Sejm (&quot;Sejm Niemy&quot;).

For the remainder of his reign, in an uneasy relationship, Augustus was more or less dependent on Russia (and to a lesser extent, on Austria) to maintain his Polish throne. He gave up his dynastic ambitions and concentrated instead on attempts to strengthen the Commonwealth. Faced with both internal and foreign opposition, however, he achieved little. In 1729 he established the Grand Musketeers Company in Dresden, one of the oldest Polish officers&#x27; schools, which in 1730 was relocated to Warsaw.

Augustus died at Warsaw in 1733. Although he had failed to make the Polish throne hereditary in his house, his eldest son, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, succeeded him to the Polish throne as Augustus III of Poland although he had to be installed by the Imperial Russian Army during the War of the Polish Succession.

==Legacy==

===Augustus II and the arts===
Augustus is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He had beautiful palaces built in Dresden, a city that became renowned for extraordinary cultural brilliance. He introduced the first public museums, such as the Green Vault in 1723, and started systematic collection of paintings that are now on display in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister.

From 1687 to 1689, Augustus toured France and Italy. The extravagant court in Versailles—perfectly tailored to fit the needs of an absolute monarch—impressed him deeply. In accordance with the spirit of the baroque age, Augustus invested heavily in the representative splendor of Dresden Castle, his major residence, to advertise his wealth and power.

With strict building regulations, major urban development plans, and a certain feeling for art, the king began to transform Dresden into a renowned cultural center with one of Germany&#x27;s finest art collections, though most of the city&#x27;s famous sights and landmarks were completed during the reign of his son Augustus III. The most famous building started under Augustus the Strong was the Zwinger. Also known are Pillnitz Castle, his summer residence, Moritzburg Castle and Hubertusburg Castle, his hunting lodges. He greatly expanded the Saxon Palace in Warsaw with the adjacent Saxon Garden, which became the city&#x27;s oldest public park and one of the first publicly accessible parks in the world. Following the devastation of the Great Northern War he also had the Royal Castle, Warsaw restored and enlarged. He also expanded the Wilanów Palace.

He granted composer Johann Adolph Hasse the title of the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Kapellmeister in 1731.

A man of pleasure, the king sponsored lavish court balls, Venetian-style &quot;balli in maschera&quot;, and luxurious court gatherings, games, and garden festivities. His court acquired a reputation for extravagance throughout Europe. He held a famous animal-tossing contest in Dresden at which 647 foxes, 533 hares, 34 badgers and 21 wildcats were tossed and killed. Augustus himself participated, reportedly demonstrating his strength by holding the end of his sling by just one finger, with two of the strongest men in his court on the other end. 

From 1 to 26 June 1730 he held the Zeithain Encampment after reorganizing and reequipping his army. The Prussian king Frederick William I was present, as well as 48 invited European princes with their military officers and envoys of the European powers. It was not only the largest troop show in Europe but also one of the most gigantic baroque festivals of its time, showcasing the high level of Saxon art and culture.

===Meissen porcelain===
Augustus II successfully sponsored efforts to discover the secret of manufacturing porcelain. In 1701 he rescued the young alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger, who had fled from the court of King Frederick I of Prussia, who had expected that he produce gold for him as he had boasted he could.

Augustus imprisoned Böttger and tried to force him to reveal the secret of manufacturing gold. Böttger&#x27;s transition from alchemist to potter was orchestrated as an attempt to avoid the impossible demands of the king. Being an alchemist by profession rather than a potter, gave Böttger an advantage. He realised that the current approaches, which involved mixing fine white substances like crushed egg shells into clay, would not work. Rather, his approach was to attempt to bake clay at higher temperatures than had ever before been attained in European kilns. That approach yielded the breakthrough that had eluded European potters for a century. By the king&#x27;s decree, the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Manufactory was established in Meissen in 1709. The manufacture of fine porcelain continues at the Meissen porcelain factory.

=== Order of the White Eagle ===

In November 1705 in Tykocin, Augustus founded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s first and preeminent order of chivalry. In 1723 he bought the Großsedlitz estate near Dresden, and after expanding the palace and garden complex, in 1727 he organized there the first ever festivities of the Order of the White Eagle.

=== Other ===
Augustus II was called &quot;the Strong&quot; for his bear-like physical strength and for his numerous offspring (only one of them his legitimate child and heir). The most famous of the king&#x27;s children born out of wedlock was Maurice de Saxe, a brilliant strategist who attained the highest military ranks in the Kingdom of France. In the War of the Polish Succession he remained loyal to his employer Louis XV, who was married to the daughter of Augustus&#x27;s rival Stanisław I Leszczyński. Augustus&#x27; granddaughter, Maria Josepha of Saxony, later became Dauphine of France through her marriage to the Dauphin Louis, and the mother of three Kings of France (Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X).

Augustus was tall, above average height for that time, but despite his extraordinary physical strength, he did not look big. In his final years he suffered from diabetes mellitus and became obese, at his death weighing some . Augustus II&#x27;s body was interred in the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków—all but his heart, which rests at the Dresden Cathedral.

==Film==
In 1936 Augustus was the subject of a Polish-German film &quot;Augustus the Strong&quot; directed by Paul Wegener. Augustus was portrayed by the actor Michael Bohnen.

==Illegitimate issue==
The Electress Christiane, who remained Protestant and refused to move to Poland with her husband, preferred to spend her time in the mansion in Pretzsch on the Elbe, where she died.

Augustus, a voracious womanizer, never missed his wife, spending his time with a series of mistresses:
*1694–1696 with Countess Maria Aurora von Königsmarck
*1696–1699 with Countess Anna Aloysia Maximiliane von Lamberg
*1698–1704 with Ursula Katharina of Altenbockum, later Princess of Teschen
*1701–1706 with Maria Aurora, later married &quot;von Spiegel&quot;, a woman of Turkish origin captured as a toddler named Fatima at the Siege of Buda (1686) and brought up in Sweden as the goddaughter of Maria Aurora von Königsmarck
*1704–1713 with Anna Constantia von Brockdorff, later Countess of Cosel
*1706–1707 with Henriette Rénard
*1708 with Angélique Debargues, French dancer and actress
*1713–1719 with Maria Magdalena of Bielinski, by her first marriage Countess of Dönhoff and by the second Princess Lubomirska
*1720–1721 with Erdmuthe Sophie of Dieskau, by marriage of Loß
*1721–1722 with Baroness Kristiane of Osterhausen, by marriage of Stanisławski

Some contemporary sources, including Wilhelmine of Bayreuth, claimed that Augustus had as many as 365 or 382 children. The number is extremely difficult to verify. Perhaps the number refers not to the king&#x27;s children but to the nights that he spent with his mistresses. Augustus officially recognised only a tiny fraction of that number as his bastards (the mothers of these &quot;chosen ones&quot;, with the possible exception of Fatima and Henriette Rénard, were all aristocratic ladies):

<text>Augustus III (; – &quot;the Saxon&quot;; ; 17 October 1696 5 October 1763) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1733 until 1763, as well as Elector of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire where he was known as Frederick Augustus II ().

He was the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, and converted to Catholicism in 1712 to secure his candidacy for the Polish throne. In 1719 he married Maria Josepha, daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, and became elector of Saxony following his father&#x27;s death in 1733. Augustus was able to gain the support of Charles VI by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and also gained recognition from Russian Empress Anna by supporting Russia&#x27;s claim to the region of Courland. He was elected king of Poland by a small minority on 5 October 1733 and subsequently banished the former Polish king Stanisław I. He was crowned in Kraków on 17 January 1734.

Augustus was supportive of Austria against Prussia in the War of Austrian Succession and again in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756), both of which resulted in Saxony being defeated and occupied by Prussia. In Poland, his rule was marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families, and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs. His rule deepened the social anarchy in Poland and increased the country&#x27;s dependence on its neighbours, notably Prussia, Austria, and Russia. The Russian Empire prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne, supporting instead the aristocrat Stanisław August Poniatowski, the lover of Catherine the Great. Throughout his reign, Augustus was known to be more interested in ease and pleasure than in the affairs of state; this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser, Heinrich von Brühl, who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful Czartoryski family.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Augustus was born 17 October 1696 in Dresden, the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, Prince-Elector of Saxony and ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth who belonged to the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin. His mother was Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, daughter of Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Unlike his father, Christiane remained a fervent Protestant throughout her life and never set foot in Catholic Poland during her 30-year service as queen consort. Despite the pressure from Augustus II, she was never crowned at Wawel in Kraków and purely held a titular title of queen. This move was viewed by the Polish nobility as a provocation and from the beginning the prince was treated with prejudice in Poland.

From his early years, Augustus was groomed to succeed as king of Poland-Lithuania; best tutors were hired from across the continent and the prince studied Polish, German, French and Latin. He was taught Russian, but was unable to speak it fluently, as well as exact sciences including mathematics, chemistry and geography. He also practiced equestrianism in his youth. While his father spent time in Poland, the young Augustus was left in the care of his grandmother, Princess Anna Sophie of Denmark, who initially raised him Lutheran. This was particularly unfavourable for the Poles, who wouldn&#x27;t accept or tolerate a Protestant monarch. As a consequence, a troubled Augustus II organized a tour of Catholic countries in Europe for his son which he hoped would bring him closer to Catholicism and break the bond between him and his controlling grandmother. In Venice, the Polish entourage thwarted a kidnapping attempt organized by British agents of Queen Anne in order to prevent him from converting. He also witnessed the coronation of Charles VI in 1711 after the death of his brother and predecessor, Joseph I.

Augustus eventually converted to Catholicism in November 1712 while extensively touring Italy, and its cultural and religious heritage. He was then under the supervision of the Jesuits, who certainly contributed to the cause. The public announcement of conversion in 1717 triggered discontent among the Protestant Saxon aristocracy. Faced with a hereditary Catholic succession for Saxony, Prussia and Hanover attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire, but Saxony managed to retain the directorship.

On 26 September 1714, Augustus was warmly welcomed by Louis XIV of France at Versailles. Louis rejoiced when he heard that Augustus converted to Catholicism and permitted him to stay at the royal court and in Paris. The young prince participated in balls, masquerades and private parties that were hosted by the Sun King himself. During this time, Augustus improved his knowledge of the French language and learnt how to approach politics and diplomacy. In June 1715, he departed Versailles and travelled across France, visiting Bordeaux, Moissac, Toulouse, Carcassonne, Marseille and Lyon. Apart from sightseeing, the purpose of this trip was to understand how cities and villages function. Being brought up in great wealth, Augustus was not entirely aware of how extensive poverty and poor living conditions could be in the countryside.

===Marriage and wedding===

On 20 August 1719, Augustus married Maria Josepha of Austria in Vienna. She was the daughter of the deceased Emperor Joseph I and niece of Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire, whose coronation young Augustus attended. This marriage wasn&#x27;t coincidental; Augustus II the Strong orchestrated it to maintain the position of the Saxons within the Holy Roman Empire. The alliance with Catholic Charles would prove fruitful in case of hostile or armed opposition from the Protestant states within the Empire. Ten days earlier, on 10 August 1719, Maria Josepha was forced to renounce her claim to the throne of Austria in favour of her uncle&#x27;s daughter, Maria Theresa. In accordance with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 issued by Charles, a female heir or the eldest daughter would be permitted to inherit the throne of Austria. Augustus II also hoped to place Saxony in a better position should there arise a war of succession to the Austrian territories.

The wedding celebration in Dresden was one of the most splendorous and expensive of the Baroque era in Europe. Over 800 guests were invited for a 2-week celebration. The main banquet was held in a chamber that was transformed into an artificial silver mine to astound the invitees. Apart from exotic dishes, over 500 deer were brought in from the Białowieża Forest for the feast. Approximately 4 million thalers were spent for this occasion.

===Succession===
Augustus II died suddenly on 1 February 1733, following a Sejm (Polish parliament) session in Warsaw. Augustus III inherited the Saxon electorate without any problems, but his election to the Polish throne was much more complicated. Shortly before the ailing king died, Prussia, Austria and Russia signed a pact known as the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, which would prevent Augustus III and Stanisław Leszczyński from inheriting the Polish throne. The royal elections in Poland and the elective monarchy, in general, weakened the country and allowed other powers to meddle in Polish affairs. The neighbouring countries that signed the treaty preferred a neutral monarch like Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém, brother of John V of Portugal, or any living relative of the Piast dynasty. The agreement had provisions for all three powers to agree that it was in their best interest that their common neighbour, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not undertake any reforms that might strengthen it and trigger expansionism. The new king would also have to maintain friendly relations with these countries.

The treaty quickly became ineffective as Prussia began to support Leszczyński and allowed him safe passage from France to Poland through German lands. As a result, Austria and Russia signed on 19 August 1733 the Löwenwolde&#x27;s Treaty, named after Karl Gustav von Löwenwolde. The terms of Löwenwolde&#x27;s Treaty were direct; Russia opted for a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; – they would provide troops to ensure Augustus III was elected king and in turn, Augustus would recognise Anna Ivanovna as Empress of Russia, thus relinquishing Polish claims to Livonia and Courland. Austria received a promise that as king, Augustus would both renounce any claim to the Austrian succession and continue respecting the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713.

===War of the Polish Succession===
Augustus on his candidacy to the Polish throne was opposed by Stanisław I Leszczyński (Stanislaus I), who had usurped the throne with Swedish support during the Great Northern War. Reigning from 1706 until 1709, Stanisław was overthrown after the Swedish defeat at Poltava. Returning from exile in 1733 with the support of Louis XV of France and Spain, Stanisław sparked the War of the Polish Succession.

Throughout the spring and summer of 1733, France began mobilizing and stationing forces along its northern and eastern borders, while Austria massed troops on the Polish frontier, reducing garrisons in the Duchy of Milan for the purpose. Prince Eugene of Savoy recommended to the emperor a more warlike posture against its longtime rival, France. He suggested that the Rhine valley and northern Italy should be strengthened with more troops, however only minimal steps were taken to improve imperial defences on the Rhine. In July 1733, Augustus agreed to Austria&#x27;s and Russia&#x27;s terms per Löwenwolde&#x27;s Treaty. During the election sejm in August, Russian troops counting 30,000 men under the command of Peter Lacy entered Poland to secure Augustus&#x27; succession. The election was &quot;de jure&quot; won by Stanisław, with 12,000 votes. Augustus received 3,000, however, he had the support of Poland&#x27;s influential, wealthiest and most corrupt magnates, such as Michał Serwacy Wiśniowiecki.

The Franco-Spanish coalition declared war on Austria and Saxony on 10 October. The Italian states of Savoy-Sardinia and Parma also joined the struggle against Austrian rule in northern Italy. Most of the battles took place outside of Poland and the main focus of the war was personal interests and demonstration of superiority. The Russian-Saxon forces chased Stanisław until he was besieged at Gdańsk (Danzig) on 22 February 1734. In June, when the garrisons at Gdańsk surrendered, Stanisław fled to Königsberg and then back to France. The Pacification Sejm in 1736 &quot;de facto&quot; confirmed Augustus III as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.

To this day, the aphorism and phrase &quot;od Sasa do Lasa&quot; (lit. from the Saxon to Leszczyński) exists in the Polish language and is used when describing two completely opposite things in everyday life.

===Reign and diplomacy===
====Poland====

As King, Augustus was uninterested in the affairs of his Polish–Lithuanian dominion, focusing instead on hunting, the opera, and the collection of artwork at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. He spent less than three years of his thirty-year reign in Poland, where political feuding between the House of Czartoryski and the Potocki paralyzed the Sejm (Liberum veto), fostering internal political anarchy and weakening the Commonwealth. Augustus delegated most of his powers and responsibilities in the Commonwealth to Heinrich von Brühl, who served in effect as the viceroy of Poland. Brühl in turn left the politics in Poland to the most powerful magnates and nobles, which resulted in widespread corruption. Under Augustus, Poland was not involved in any major conflicts which further lessened its position in Europe and allowed the neighbouring countries to take advantage of the disorder. Any opposition was violently crushed by Brühl, who used either Saxon or Russian forces that permanently stationed in the country.

Brühl was a skillful diplomat and strategist; Augustus could only be reached through him if an important political feud arose. He was also the head of the Saxon court in Dresden and was fond of collectibles, such as gadgets, jewellery and Meissen porcelain, the most famous being the Swan Service composed of 2,200 individual pieces made between 1737 and 1741. It has been described as possibly &quot;the finest table service ever produced&quot; and part of it are exhibited at the National Museum in Warsaw. He also owned the largest collections of watches, vests, wigs and hats in Europe, though this cannot be accurately assessed. Brühl was depicted by his rivals as a nouveau-riche materialist, who used his wealth to gain support. His lavish spending was immortalized by Augustus&#x27; reported question to the viceroy &quot;Brühl, do I have money?&quot;

By 1748 Augustus III completed extending the Saxon Palace in Warsaw and made significant contributions in remodelling the Royal Castle. In 1750, von Brühl purchased a residence adjacent to the larger Saxon Palace and transformed it into a rococo masterpiece, which later became known as the Brühl Palace. Both buildings were completely destroyed by the Nazis during World War II.

====War of the Austrian Succession====
With the marriage to the Austrian princess Maria Josepha, Augustus was bound to accept the succession of her cousin, Maria Theresa, as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia. Saxony mediated between the friendly French faction and the Habsburg faction of Maria Theresa. Between 1741 and 1742 Saxony was allied with France, but changed sides with the help of Austrian diplomats.

In the first days of December 1740, the Prussians assembled along the Oder river and on 16 December, Frederick II invaded Silesia without a formal declaration of war. The Austrian troops which then stationed in Silesia were poorly supplied and outnumbered as the Habsburgs concentrated their supreme force on Hungary and Italy. They held onto the fortresses of Glogau, Breslau, and Brieg, but abandoned the rest of the region and withdrew into Moravia. This campaign gave Prussia control of most of the richest provinces in the Habsburg monarchy, with the commercial centre of Breslau as well as mining, weaving and dyeing industries. Silesia was also rich in natural resources such as coal, chalk, copper and gold.

Saxony joined Austria in the Second Silesian War, which erupted after Prussia proclaimed its support of Charles VII as Holy Roman Emperor and invaded Bohemia on 15 August 1744. The true cause behind the invasion was Frederick&#x27;s personal expansionist ideas and goals. On 8 January 1745, the Treaty of Warsaw united Great Britain, the Habsburg monarchy, the Dutch Republic and Saxony into what became known as the &quot;Quadruple Alliance&quot;, which was aimed at securing the Austrian throne for Maria Theresa. Soon-after Charles VII died of gout in Munich, which weakened the Prussians. However, Prussia still maintained military superiority; the successful battles of Hennersdorf and Kesselsdorf opened the way to Dresden, which Frederick occupied on 18 December. The Treaty of Dresden was eventually completed on Christmas Day (25 December) and Saxony was obliged to pay one million rixdollars in reparations to the Prussian state. The treaty ended the Second Silesian War with a &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;.

Maria Theresa was finally recognized in her inheritance with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, which proved a Pyrrhic victory for Augustus III; the conflict nearly bankrupted Saxony. Meanwhile, the affairs in Poland remained highly neglected.

====Seven Years&#x27; War====
The Electorate of Saxony was involved in the Seven Years&#x27; War from 1756 to 1763. The Saxons were allied with Austria and Russia against Frederick the Great of Prussia, who saw Saxony as another potential field for expansion. Saxony was then merely a buffer zone between Prussia and Austrian Bohemia as well as Silesia, which Frederick attempted to annex in their entirety. Moreover, Saxony and Poland were separated by a strip of land in Silesia and Lusatia which made the movement of troops even more difficult. Frederick&#x27;s plans also entailed annexing the Electorate of Hanover, but joining France would trigger an Austro-Russian attack and occupation. On 29 August 1756, the Prussian Army preemptively invaded Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War, a theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Saxony was bled dry and exploited at the maximum extent to support Prussia&#x27;s war effort. The Treaty of Hubertusburg signed on 15 February 1763 ended the conflict with Frederick&#x27;s victory and Saxony renounced its claim to Silesia.

===Death===
In April 1763, Augustus returned ill and frail from Poland to Dresden with his closest advisors, leaving Primate Władysław Aleksander Łubieński behind to take care of the affairs in the Commonwealth. He died suddenly on 5 October 1763 in Dresden from apoplexy (stroke). Unlike his father who rests at Wawel in Kraków, Augustus III was buried at Dresden Cathedral and remains one of the few Polish monarchs who were buried outside of Poland.

Augustus&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Frederick Christian, succeeded his father as elector but died two and a half months later.

In the Commonwealth, on 7 September 1764, with the small participation of the szlachta initiated by the Czartoryski&#x27;s and the strong support of Russia, Stanisław August Poniatowski was elected king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Reigning under the name Stanisław II Augustus, Poniatowski was the son of the elder Stanisław Poniatowski, a powerful Polish noble and a onetime agent of Stanisław I; in youth he was a lover of Catherine II of Russia and as such enjoyed strong support from that Empress&#x27;s court.

==Legacy==
===Patron of arts===

Augustus III was a great patron of the arts and architecture. During his reign the Baroque Catholic Church of the Royal Court in Dresden (present-day Dresden Cathedral) was built, in which he was later buried as one of the few Polish kings buried outside the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He greatly expanded the Dresden art gallery, to the extent that in 1747 it was placed in a new location at the present-day Johanneum, where it remained until 1855 when it was moved to the newly built Semper Gallery. In 1748 he founded the Opera House (&quot;Operalnia&quot;) in Warsaw and the &quot;Collegium medico-chirurgicum&quot;, the first medical school in Dresden. During his reign, the extension of the Saxon Palace in Warsaw, begun by his father Augustus II, was completed, and the reconstruction of the eastern façade of the Royal Castle was ordered, thus creating the so-called Saxon Façade, an iconic part of the Vistula panorama of the Warsaw Old Town.

In 1733, the composer Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated the Kyrie–Gloria Mass in B minor, (early version), to Augustus in honor of his succession to the Saxon electorate, with the hope of appointment as Court Composer, a title Bach received three years later. Bach&#x27;s title of &quot;Koeniglicher Pohlnischer Hoff Compositeur&quot; (&quot;Royal Polish Court Composer&quot;, and court composer to the Elector of Saxony) is engraved on the title page of Bach&#x27;s famous Goldberg Variations. Augustus III was also the patron of composer Johann Adolph Hasse, who was granted the title of the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Kapellmeister by his father, Augustus II, in 1731, and thanks to Augustus III the same title was obtained in 1716 by composer Johann David Heinichen.

===Personal life and criticism===
In 1732, a French priest named Gabriel Piotr Baudouin founded the first orphanage in Poland, situated in Warsaw&#x27;s Old Town. The facility was later moved to the nearby Warecki Square (now Warsaw Insurgents Square), and in 1758 Augustus III decreed that the new institution be called &quot;Szpital Generalny Dzieciątka Jezus&quot; (The General Hospital of Infant Jesus). The newly established hospital expanded its operations into treating not only orphans but also the sick and the poor. Augustus remained a charitable man throughout his life and donated to the hospital. His successor, Stanisław Augustus, also contributed to the cause.

Despite his charitable manner, Augustus was viewed in Poland as an impotent monarch, obese, plump, ugly and lazy with no interest in the affairs of the state. Such harsh critique and opinion continues to this day. On the other hand, historian Jacek Staszewski was able to find a description of Augustus&#x27; character in the Dresden archives in the late 1980s; he was considered an honest and affectionate man, who was widely respected during his reign by both the Saxons and the Poles. In his personal life, Augustus was a devoted husband to Maria Josepha, with whom he had sixteen children. Unlike his father who was a notorious womanizer, he was never unfaithful and enjoyed spending time with his spouse, uncommon among the royalty in those days. He also favoured hunting.

==Depictions==
Augustus III was portrayed by Ernst Dernburg in the 1941 film &quot;Friedemann Bach&quot;.

<text>Eugene Merle Shoemaker (April 28, 1928 – July 18, 1997) was an American geologist. He co-discovered Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with his wife Carolyn S. Shoemaker and David H. Levy. This comet hit Jupiter in July 1994: the impact was televised around the world. Shoemaker also studied terrestrial craters, such as Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona, and along with Edward Chao provided the first conclusive evidence of its origin as an impact crater. He was also the first director of the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s Astrogeology Research Program.

He was killed in a car accident while visiting an impact crater site in Australia. After his death, some of his ashes were carried to the Moon with the Lunar Prospector mission.

==Early life and formal education==
Shoemaker was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Muriel May (née Scott), a teacher; and George Estel Shoemaker, who worked in farming, business, teaching, and motion pictures. His parents were natives of Nebraska. During Gene&#x27;s childhood they moved between Los Angeles, New York City, Buffalo, New York and Wyoming, as George worked on a variety of jobs. George hated living in big cities, and was quite satisfied to take a job as director of education for a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Wyoming. His wife soon found life in a remote cabin quite unsatisfactory. They compromised, when Muriel got a teaching job in Buffalo. She could teach in the Buffalo School of Practice of the State Teachers College at Buffalo during the school year while keeping Gene with her, then both would return to Wyoming during the summers. Gene&#x27;s passion for studying rocks was ignited by the science education courses offered by the Buffalo Museum of Education. He enrolled in the School of Practice in the fourth grade, and began collecting samples of minerals. Within a year, he was also taking high-school-level evening courses. The family moved back to Los Angeles in 1942, where Gene enrolled in Fairfax High School at the age of thirteen. He completed high school in three years. During that time he also played violin in the school orchestra, excelled in gymnastics, and got a summer job as an apprentice lapidary.

Shoemaker enrolled in the Caltech in 1944, at the age of sixteen. His classmates were older, more mature and on a fast track to graduate before serving in World War II. Shoemaker thrived in the fast pace and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1948, at age nineteen. He immediately undertook the study of Precambrian metamorphic rocks in northern New Mexico, earning his M.Sc. degree from Caltech in 1949.

==Family==

While Shoemaker was attending Caltech, his roommate was Richard Spellman, a young man from Chico, California. Although Shoemaker had already enrolled in a doctoral program at Princeton University, he returned to California to serve as best man at Richard&#x27;s wedding in 1950. He met Richard&#x27;s sister, Carolyn, for the first time on that occasion. Carolyn was born in Gallup, New Mexico, in 1929, but the Spellman family moved to Chico soon afterward. Carolyn earned degrees from Chico State College in history and political science. She never exhibited an interest in scientific subjects while growing up, and took one geology course in college, which she found boring. Nevertheless, the couple kept in touch while Shoemaker spent the next year in Princeton, followed by a two-week vacation touring the Colorado Plateau. She reportedly told others that listening to Shoemaker explain geology turned a boring subject into an exciting and interesting pursuit of knowledge. The couple married on August 17, 1951.

The Shoemakers had three children: two daughters and one son. Carolyn saw her work as keeping house and raising the children especially after they settled in Flagstaff in the 1960s. She had tried teaching school before they married, but found the work unsatisfying. She also traveled sometimes with Gene, but stopped after she noticed that her absence affected the children. After their children were grown, Carolyn wanted something meaningful to combat the &quot;empty nest&quot; feeling. By then, Gene suggested that she take up astronomy and join his team looking for asteroids approaching Earth. A student working at Lowell Observatory commenced teaching her astronomy. She showed great potential and launched her career as a planetary astronomer at age 51. She continued the work until her death in 2021.

== Scientific contributions ==
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) hired Shoemaker in 1950, and he maintained an association with the organisation for the rest of his career. His first assignment was to search for uranium deposits in Utah and Colorado. His next mission was to study volcanic processes, since other investigators had already noticed that uranium deposits were often located in the vents of ancient volcanoes. This study led him to explore the Hopi Buttes of Northern Arizona, which happened to be near Meteor Crater.

Daniel Barringer, an entrepreneur and mining engineer who had discovered Meteor Crater in 1891, had postulated that it had been caused by the impact of a meteor. About the same time, G. K. Gilbert, the chief geologist of the USGS, examined the crater and announced that it had been created by an explosive venting of volcanic steam. A majority of scientists accepted Gilbert&#x27;s explanation of the cause of the crater, and it remained the conventional wisdom until Shoemaker&#x27;s investigations half a century later.

For his PhD degree at Princeton (1960), under the guidance of Harry Hammond Hess, Shoemaker studied the impact dynamics of Barringer Meteor Crater. Shoemaker noted Meteor Crater had the same form and structure as two explosion craters created from atomic bomb tests at the Nevada Test Site, notably Jangle U in 1951 and Teapot Ess in 1955. In 1960, Edward C. T. Chao and Shoemaker identified shocked quartz (coesite) at Meteor Crater, proving the crater was formed from an impact generating extremely high temperatures and pressures. They followed this discovery with the identification of coesite within suevite at Nördlinger Ries, proving its impact origin.

===Astrogeology and Apollo===

In 1960, Shoemaker directed a team at the USGS center in Menlo Park, California, to generate the first geologic map of the Moon using photographs taken by Francis G. Pease. Shoemaker also helped pioneer the field of astrogeology by founding the Astrogeology Research Program. He was prominently involved in the Lunar Ranger missions to the Moon, joining the television imaging team of Harold Urey and Gerard Kuiper, which turned into a preparatory mission for the future crewed landing. Shoemaker was then chosen to be the principal investigator for the Surveyor program&#x27;s television experiment, and then the lunar geology principal investigator for Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 13.

Shoemaker was also involved in the training of the American astronauts. He himself was a possible candidate for an Apollo Moon flight and was set to be the first geologist to walk on the Moon but was disqualified due to being diagnosed with Addison&#x27;s disease, a disorder of the adrenal gland. Shoemaker would train astronauts during field trips to Meteor Crater and Sunset Crater near Flagstaff. He was a CBS News television commentator on the early Apollo missions, especially the Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 missions, appearing with Walter Cronkite during live coverage of those flights.

According to David H. Levy, just before the crewed Moon landings,
He was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1965. Coming to Caltech in 1969, he started a systematic search for Earth orbit-crossing asteroids, which resulted in the discovery of several families of such asteroids, including the Apollo asteroids. Shoemaker advanced the idea that sudden geologic changes can arise from asteroid strikes and that asteroid strikes are common over geologic time periods. Previously, astroblemes were thought to be remnants of extinct volcanoes – even on the Moon.

===Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9===
In 1993, he co-discovered Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 using the 18-inch Schmidt camera at Palomar Observatory. This comet was unique in that it provided the first opportunity to observe the planetary impact of a comet. Shoemaker–Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in July 1994. The resulting impact caused a massive &quot;scar&quot; on the face of Jupiter.

== Death ==
Shoemaker spent much of his later years searching for and finding several previously unnoticed or undiscovered impact craters around the world. During one such expedition, on July 18, 1997, he died in a head-on car collision on the remote Tanami Track, a few hundred kilometers northwest of Alice Springs, Australia. Shoemaker&#x27;s wife Carolyn was severely injured in the crash.

On July 31, 1999, some of his ashes were carried to the Moon by the Lunar Prospector space probe in a capsule designed by Carolyn Porco. Celestis, Inc. provided the service—at NASA&#x27;s request—commercially, making Shoemaker&#x27;s ashes the first private delivery to the lunar surface. Celestis is the memorial spaceflight company that flew the ashes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry into space, as well as &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor James Doohan (&quot;Scotty&quot;), Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper and hundreds of other people from around the world. Shoemaker is the only person whose remains have been placed on any celestial body outside Earth. The brass foil wrapping of Shoemaker&#x27;s memorial capsule is inscribed with images of Comet Hale–Bopp (&quot;the last comet that the Shoemakers observed together&quot;), the Barringer Meteor Crater, and a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; reading

The fatal crash happened when Hale-Bopp was still visible to the naked eye, having passed perihelion and having moved into the southern celestial hemisphere.

On July 24, 1997, a memorial for Shoemaker and Jurgen Rahe was presented in the U.S. House of Representatives by California representative George E. Brown Jr. The memorial was published in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. The memorial credited Shoemaker with being either the discoverer or co-discoverer of 820 asteroids and comets during his career. 

A ring-like topographic feature in Western Australia, an astrobleme previously named the &quot;Teague ring&quot; was renamed &quot;Shoemaker Crater&quot; in honor of Shoemaker. The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous space probe was renamed &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; in his honor. It arrived at asteroid 433 Eros in February 2000, and landed on the asteroid after a year of orbital study. He was previously honored with the asteroid 2074 Shoemaker, discovered and named by his colleague, Eleanor F. Helin.

In their 2020 album, &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot;, Finnish metal band Nightwish paid tribute to Shoemaker in the song &quot;Shoemaker&quot;. Composer Tuomas Holopainen says he was inspired by his biography, which moved the entire band to tears.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
Shoemaker is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the co-discovery of 183 minor planets between 1977 and 1994.

<text>The greater bulldog bat or fisherman bat (Noctilio leporinus) is a species of fishing bat native to Latin America (Spanish: &quot;murciélago pescador&quot;; Portuguese: &quot;morcego-pescador&quot;). The bat uses echolocation to detect water ripples made by the fish upon which it preys, then uses the pouch between its legs to scoop the fish up and its sharp claws to catch and cling to it. It is not to be confused with the lesser bulldog bat, which, though belonging to the same genus, merely catches water insects, such as water striders and water beetles.

It emits echolocation sounds through the mouth like &quot;Myotis daubentoni&quot;, but the sounds are quite different, containing a long constant frequency part around 55 kHz, which is an unusually high frequency for a bat this large.

==General description==
The greater bulldog bat is a large bat, often with a combined body and head length of . It generally weighs from . Males tend to be larger than females, with the former averaging and the latter averaging . They also differ in fur color. Males have bright orange fur on the back while females are dull gray. However, both sexes have pale undersides and may have a pale line that runs down the middle of the back. The males do not have a baculum. The bulldog bat has rounded nostrils that open forward and down. It has elongated, pointed ears with a tragus that gets ridged at the outer edge. The bulldog bat has smooth lips but its upper lip is divided by a skin fold while its bottom lip has a wart above skin folds that extend to the chin. It is these features that give the bulldog bat its name, as it resembles a bulldog.

The bulldog bat has a wingspan of .[Source?] The wing of the bat is longer than the head and body combined and 65% of its wingspan is made of the third digit. When in flight, the bat&#x27;s wings move slowly. This species is a capable swimmer and will use its wings to paddle. The greater bulldog bat also has prominent cheek pouches which are useful for holding its food. Its hind legs and feet are particularly large, capable of 180° rotation when hunting. The leg bones are significantly compressed in order to be streamlined towards the dragging direction.

==Distribution and variation==
The greater bulldog bat&#x27;s range stretches from Mexico to Northern Argentina and also includes most Caribbean islands. While vast, its range is also patchy as the bat is limited to mostly well-watered lowland and coastal areas as well as river basins. There is geographical variation in the species and are classified as subspecies. Bats around the Caribbean Basin are large and usually have the pale mid-dorsal stripe, despite varying in pelage. These bats are known as &quot;N. l. mastivus&quot;. In Guianas and the Amazon Basin, the bats are small and dark and often lack the pale mid-dorsal stripe. These bats are known as &quot;N. l. leporinus&quot;. In eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil and northern Argentina bats tend to be large and pale, more so than the other subspecies. They are known as &quot;N. l. rufenscenes.

==Ecology and behavior==
The greater bulldog bat lives primarily in tropical lowlands. The bats are commonly found over ponds and streams as well as estuaries and coastal lagoons. They live in colonies that number in the hundreds. In Trinidad, bulldog bats rest in hollow trees like silk-cotton, red mangrove and balatá. The bats live in hollow tree roosts in other areas as well. They also roost in deep sea caves. Like most bats, bulldog bats are nocturnal.

Female bulldog bats stay together in groups while roosting and tend to be accompanied by a resident male. Females associate with the same individuals in the same location for several years unaffected by changes in resident males and movements of the group to different roosts. A male may stay with a female group for two or more reproductive seasons. Bachelor males are segregated from the females and may roost alone or together in small groups. Female bats forage either alone or with their roost mates, with stable female groups continue to forage in the same areas in the long term. Males forage alone and use areas that are larger and separate from those used by the females.

===Food and hunting===
The greater bulldog bat is one of the few bat species that has adapted to eating fish. Nevertheless, the bats eat both fish and insects. During the wet season, the bats feed primarily on insects like moths and beetles. During the dry season, bats will primarily feed on fish as well as crabs, scorpions and shrimp to a lesser extent. The bulldog bat mostly forages for fish during high tide and locates them with echolocation. A bulldog bat will fly high in the air and in a circular direction when searching for prey. If it spots a jumping fish, the bat will drop down closer to the water surface, particularly the spot where it made the jump, and decreases the pulse duration and intervals of its echolocation signals. The bulldog bat may also search by dragging its feet across the water surface, a behavior known as raking. The bat may rake through areas where fish jumping is most frequent or in areas where it had previously made a successful catch.

===Echolocation===
Greater bulldog bats emit echolocation signals that are either at constant frequency (CF), frequency-modulated (FM) or a combination of the two (CF-FM). The longest signals are the pure CF signal which typically last 13.3 ms but can go as long as 17 ms. CF-FM signals have CF followed by an FM. In a CF-FM signal, the CF are typically 8.9 ms with a frequency of 52.8–56.2 kHz while the FM ranges up to 3.9 ms with 25.9 kHz bandwidth. Bulldog bats have two kinds of signal when flying. In one, the CF pulses begin at 60 kHz of frequency and may fall no further than 50 kHz. The second type has the CF starting at a frequency of 60 kHz and then falls for more than a single octave.

===Reproduction===
For females, pregnancy occurs from September until January, and lactation starts in November and continues until April. Only one young is born each gestation. Male bats mostly breed autumn and winter. Young bats stay in the roosts for one month and are then capable of flight. Both the male and female care for the young.

==Status==
While the bulldog bat is not in danger overall, the bat is nevertheless threatened by water pollution, persecution, changing water levels, cave disturbances, and deforestation.

<text>The lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) is an insectivorous and occasionally carnivorous bat of the (Neotropics), ranging through Central America and northern South America. Some unique characteristics of the bat include, large feet that are used to rake the surface of water to capture prey, and precise echolocation. Occasionally, the larger bats catch and consume small fish (the most closely related species, the greater bulldog bat, is known for its fishing ability).

== Description ==
The lesser bulldog bat is a sexually dimoprhic species; males are typically bright red and females are typically dull brown. Furthermore, coloration varies between individuals among the same sex, and between different populations. They have a length of about three inches (7.5 cm), a forearm length of , and weight of about one ounce (30 grams). The bats plump lips and chin that has well-developed cross ridges give rise to the bats &quot;bulldog-like&quot; appearance. The lesser bulldog bat has large feet that are claw-like and can be used capture prey.

== Habitat ==
The bats prefer terrestrial habitats and they live near water or damp locations, residing in hollow trees or domestic dwellings. The locations that they can be found in includes: Argentina; Belize; Bolivia, Plurinational States of; Brazil; Costa Rica; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Guatemala; Guyana; Honduras; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru.

==Feeding==
The species prefers to feed predominantly on insects, catching them while flying over water. Studies on Costa Rican population say that the bats also consume tree pollen.

== Echolocation ==
&quot;Noctilio albvirentis&quot; is known for utilizing its echolocation to locate prey such as insects. The unique feature of their echolocation is how they use it to locate their prey. As they skim across the water they will bombard the water with their vocalization and when they detect a disturbance of the vocalization they move to the disturbance. Additionally, since the lesser bulldog bat prefers to forage in small groups they also use echolocation to communicate during foraging.

== Development and lifespan ==
They live about ten years and reach sexual maturity in one year. Ovulation occurs in the ovary the gestation period lasts about 4 to 5 weeks. Baby bats are capable of very limited vocalization, and they cannot begin flight until 5 to 6 weeks after birth. Mother bats will feed their young until the babies are three months old. 

== Predators ==
Predation on bats is uncommon however large birds are known to prey upon bats. One distinct bird that preys on the lesser bulldog bat is The Great Rufous Woodcreeper. The woodcreeper will invade the bats roost and take the bat from its habitat. Upon capture the Woodcreeper pecks the bat with its sharp beak until the bat dies. Other predators of the bat include hawks, falcons, owls, and motmots.

<text>The bath brick (also known as Patent Scouring or Flanders bricks), patented in 1823 by William Champion and John Browne, was a predecessor of the scouring pad used for cleaning and polishing.

Bath bricks were made by a number of companies in the town of Bridgwater, England, from fine clay dredged from the River Parrett near Dunball. The silt, which was collected from the river on either side of the Town Bridge, contained fine particles of alumina and silica. It was collected from beds of brick rubble left in the rain for the salt to be washed out and then put into a &quot;pugging mill&quot; which was powered by a horse to be mixed, before being shaped into moulds and dried. These would be wrapped in paper and boxed for sale in England and throughout the British Empire. By the end of the 19th century around 24 million bath bricks had been produced in Bridgwater for the home and international markets.

The brick, similar in size to an ordinary house brick, could be used in a number of ways. A mild abrasive powder could be scraped from the brick and used as a scouring powder on floors and other surfaces. Powder could also be moistened with water for use on a cloth for polishing or as a kind of sand paper. Items such as knives might be polished directly on a wetted brick.

<text>Klaus Wilhelm Heinrich Teuber (25 June 1952 – 1 April 2023) was a German board game designer best known as the creator of &quot;Catan&quot;. Originally working as a dental technician, he began designing games first as a hobby then as a full-time career.

Four of his games won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) award: &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (1988), &quot;Adel Verpflichtet&quot; (1990), &quot;Drunter und Drüber&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; (1995). The latter sold over 40 million copies, was translated into 40 languages and spawned a family of expansions and versions. Teuber founded the games company Catan GmbH in 2002 and his sons now direct the family business.

Teuber was inducted into the Origin Awards Hall of Fame by the AAGAD (Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design) in 2004. In 2010, he received a special As d&#x27;Or in recognition of his lifetime achievement at the Festival International des Jeux in France.

==Early life==

Teuber was born in 1952 in the village of Rai-Breitenbach, West Germany, under the Breuberg castle. As a child, he played games with model soldiers. He later wrote that his favourite subject in school was geography – he enjoyed making maps – followed by history and chemistry. Teuber returned to gaming as a young husband and father during his military service.

At the age of 11, Teuber was given the board game &quot;Romans vs. Carthaginians&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;catan/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Teuber graduated from high school and did military service, then studied chemistry, then completed his intermediate diploma (receiving a degree in chemistry), then joined his father&#x27;s 65-employee dental laboratory business which fell into large problems, and his father fell ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;SdZ/Teuber-tot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Barbarossa&quot;==
&quot;When I had trouble in my former profession and needed a mental vacation, I read a book about witches and decided to make a game that follows the story first. Each development of game, I wanted to experience the world of the novel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nikkei/Teuber&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Teuber worked as a dental technician for the business &quot;Teuber Dental-Labor&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel/Teuber-nachruf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; near Darmstadt, but he was not happy in this work. In the 1980s, he designed his first game, &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, inspired by the fantasy trilogy, &quot;The Riddle-Master&quot;, by Patricia A. McKillip. In the game, players make sculptures out of modelling clay, and try to guess what the objects represent. After working on the game for seven years, Teuber finally showed &quot;Barbarossa&quot; to a publisher.

== &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; ==

In 1991, Teuber started designing &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;, inspired by the history of Viking settlers in Iceland. He took four years to develop the island-settling game; his major breakthrough was when he introduced hexagonal tiles instead of using squares to represent wood, ore, brick, wool, and wheat. &quot;Catan&quot; has been credited with launching a new more &quot;social&quot; era for board games, introducing bargaining and bartering among players as part of the strategy to win. 

In 1999 he sold the dental laboratory, which was taken over by his father.

The commercial success of &quot;Catan&quot; allowed Teuber to become a full-time game designer in 1998. The family game business was incorporated as Catan GmbH in 2002 and his sons Benjamin and Guido are directors while his wife Claudia and his daughter also have roles as bookkeeper and tester.

The popularity of &quot;Catan&quot; continued to grow, eventually translated into 40 languages, with multiple expansions, geographically themed versions, a card game, a version for young children, a video game, and online versions, as well as a novel and other spinoffs. For the development of the video game adaptation of &quot;Catan&quot;, Teuber created a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with &quot;elaborate logic chains and probability matrices&quot; so that the developers could determine the effects of each action on gameplay.

In 2020, sales of &quot;Catan&quot; surged during the first five months of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as board games became popular during the worldwide lockdown. As of 2023, more than 40 million copies of &quot;Catan&quot; have been sold worldwide.

Despite the success of &quot;Catan&quot;, Teuber was described as remaining down to earth. In 2023, Dan Zak wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Among hobbyists and gamers he was revered like a rock star, but he looked and acted and sounded like a man who tinkered with stuff in his basement...He was, at heart, a hobbyist.&quot; When Teuber was asked why he thought Catan was so popular, he said it may have been due to a &quot;good balance between strategy and luck&quot;.

==Death==
Teuber died on 1 April 2023 at age 70, after a brief illness.

<text>Barisal Division (; ) is one of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of , and a population of 9,325,820 at the 2022 Census. It is the least populous Division in Bangladesh. It is bounded by Dhaka Division on the north, the Bay of Bengal on the south, Chittagong Division on the east and Khulna Division on the west. The administrative capital, Barisal city, lies in the Padma River delta on an offshoot of the Arial Khan River. Barisal division is criss-crossed by numerous rivers that earned it the nickname &quot;Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tin-e Borishal&quot; (rice, river and canal built Barisal).

== History ==

===Ancient period===
The modern Barisal division area was the part of Vanga and Gangaridai empire in ancient times. After the fall of Gupta rule in Bengal, the region became a part of Gauda Kingdom in the 6th century. Later the region came under the rule of Khadgas, Palas, Chandras and Varmans in the early mediaeval period. According to the epigraphical records of Sena period, the mordern Barisal was known as &quot;Anuttara Banga&quot; (southern Bengal), an ancient division of Bengal region. After the reign of Sena Dynasty, Barisal was ruled by Deva kings in the 12th-13th century.

=== Early Middle Ages ===

In early times the Barisal region was composed of an amalgamation of marshlands formed by the merging of islands brought into existence and built up by alluvial soils washed down the great channels of the combined Brahmaputra-Ganges-Meghna river systems.

In the early 13th century, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji led the Muslim conquest of Barisal, and soon later Muhammad bin Tughluq completely conquered eastern Bengal. The Hindu chieftains from northwest Bengal were dislodged from power and they dispersed over Barisal region and founded the kingdom of Bakla.

During the Mughal intervention in Bengal, Hindu society was concentrated to northern and western Barisal (known as Bakarganj). Barisal&#x27;s southern portion was still covered by forests and laced with lagoons. The northwest was also the only part of Bakarganj where the Hindu population exceeded Muslims in early British censuses.

===Mughal period===

Barisal saw a second wave of immigration in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This time, it was Muslim pioneers who assumed the leading role. Establishing Dhaka as the provincial Mughal capital of the region, in the early 17th century the Barisal region (known as Sarkar Bakla to Mughals) was more accessible to businessmen and developers than at any previous time. However, piracy in this region along the coasts and rivers of southeastern Bengal by Arakanese and renegade Portuguese seamen inhibited any sustained attempts by Mughal governors to push into the Barisal forests.

After 1666, when Mughal naval forces cleared the Meghna estuary of such external threats, the Barisal interior lay ripe for colonization. Land developers acquired grants of plots of land, taluq (তালুক), from provincial authorities. Abundant and easily obtainable by purchase from the late 17th century, these grants tended to be regarded by their possessors taluqdar (তালুকদার). As taluqdars brought their taluqs into agricultural production, these men passed up the land revenue through a class of non-cultivating intermediaries, or zamindar (জমিদার). Zamindars typically resided in the provincial capital, where they had ready access to the chief provincial revenue officer, or dewan (দেওয়ান).

In a second pattern of land development, Muslim pirs or Qazi went directly into uncultivated regions, organized the local population for clearing the jungles, and only later, after having established themselves as local men of influence, entered into relations with the Mughal authorities. Relationships between the religious Muslim pirs and Mughal authorities was not always harmonious, since a pir&#x27;s natural ties of authority and patronage generally lay with the masses of peasants beneath him and not with the governors and bureaucrats. For example, in remote Jhalakati Thana in the eastern Bakarganj many of 18th-century pirs and Educationist, Islamic scholars came under the authority, among them named Saiyid Faqir and Faizus Ahmed Khan (A Persian business man and educationist, came for the business trade through Khyber pass and spread education among the Indian sub continent) from wielded enormous influence with the cultivators of the all-Muslim village of Saiyidpur, Hizla and Muladi named after the pirs. But a difficulty arose, noted a 1906 village survey of Pir Fakir of Saiyidpur village, because &quot;the people of this part looked upon the Fakir as their guide and did not pay rent to the Nawab.&quot; In this situation, one Lala Chet Singh, a captain in the employ of the governor, &quot;succeeded in persuading the Fakir to leave the country.&quot;

=== British rule ===

In 1797 the area was established as Bakerganj District but later renamed as Barisal District and Pir of Hizla-Muladi, Faizus Ahmed Khan stayed back and settled in Muladi-Hizla village.

=== Pakistani rule ===

In 1948 part of Bakerganj District area was renamed Barisal and other was Patuakhali District as one of five districts of Khulna Division.

=== Bangladesh ===

The Greater Barisal region (Barisal District along with five other neighbouring districts) was created as Barisal Division on 1 January 1993.

== Economy ==
Barisal is known as the &quot;Granary of Bengal&quot; for its rice production. It is still an important rice-producing area of the country. Since the Middle Ages, Barisal has acted as a trans-shipment center for hides, rice, dried beans, dried peas, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes for Bengal. Bakery, textile, and pharmaceutical products are the output of a few industrial installations. There are Sher-e Bangla Medical College (affiliated with the National University) and B. M.

<text>Transonic (or transsonic) flow is air flowing around an object at a speed that generates regions of both subsonic and supersonic airflow around that object. The exact range of speeds depends on the object&#x27;s critical Mach number, but transonic flow is seen at flight speeds close to the speed of sound (343 m/s at sea level), typically between Mach 0.8 and 1.2.

The issue of transonic speed (or transonic region) first appeared during World War II. Pilots found as they approached the sound barrier the airflow caused aircraft to become unsteady. Experts found that shock waves can cause large-scale separation downstream, increasing drag, adding asymmetry and unsteadiness to the flow around the vehicle. Research has been done into weakening shock waves in transonic flight through the use of anti-shock bodies and supercritical airfoils.

Most modern jet powered aircraft are engineered to operate at transonic air speeds. Transonic airspeeds see a rapid increase in drag from about Mach 0.8, and it is the fuel costs of the drag that typically limits the airspeed. Attempts to reduce wave drag can be seen on all high-speed aircraft. Most notable is the use of swept wings, but another common form is a wasp-waist fuselage as a side effect of the Whitcomb area rule.

Transonic speeds can also occur at the tips of rotor blades of helicopters and aircraft. This puts severe, unequal stresses on the rotor blade and may lead to accidents if it occurs. It is one of the limiting factors of the size of rotors and the forward speeds of helicopters (as this speed is added to the forward-sweeping [leading] side of the rotor, possibly causing localized transonics).

== History==

=== Discovering transonic airflow===
Issues with aircraft flight relating to speed first appeared during the supersonic era in 1941. Ralph Virden, a test pilot, crashed in a fatal plane accident. He lost control of the plane when a shock wave caused by supersonic airflow developed over the wing, causing it to stall. Virden flew well below the speed of sound at Mach 0.675, which brought forth the idea of different airflows forming around the plane. In the 40s, Kelly Johnson became one of the first engineers to investigate the effect of compressibility on aircraft. However, contemporary wind tunnels did not have the capability to create wind speeds close to Mach 1 to test the effects of transonic speeds. Not long after, the term &quot;transonic&quot; was defined to mean &quot;across the speed of sound&quot; and was invented by NACA director Hugh Dryden and Theodore von Kármán of the California Institute of Technology.

=== Changes in aircraft===
Initially, NACA designed &quot;dive flaps&quot; to help stabilize the plane when reaching transonic flight. This small flap on the underside of the plane slowed the plane to prevent shock waves, but this design only delayed finding a solution to aircraft flying at supersonic speed. Newer wind tunnels were designed, so researchers could test newer wing designs without risking test pilots&#x27; lives. The slotted-wall transonic tunnel was designed by NASA and allowed researchers to test wings and different airfoils in transonic airflow to find the best wingtip shape for sonic speeds.

After World War II, major changes in aircraft design were seen to improve transonic flight. The main way to stabilize an aircraft was to reduce the speed of the airflow around the wings by changing the chord of the plane wings, and one solution to prevent transonic waves was swept wings. Since the airflow would hit the wings at an angle, this would decrease the wing thickness and chord ratio. Airfoils wing shapes were designed flatter at the top to prevent shock waves and reduce the distance of airflow over the wing. Later on, Richard Whitcomb designed the first supercritical airfoil using similar principles.

=== Mathematical analysis===

Prior to the advent of powerful computers, even the simplest forms of the compressible flow equations were difficult to solve due to their nonlinearity. A common assumption used to circumvent this nonlinearity is that disturbances within the flow are relatively small, which allows mathematicians and engineers to linearize the compressible flow equations into a relatively easily solvable set of differential equations for either wholly subsonic or supersonic flows. This assumption is fundamentally untrue for transonic flows because the disturbance caused by an object is much larger than in subsonic or supersonic flows; a flow speed close to or at Mach 1 does not allow the streamtubes (3D flow paths) to contract enough around the object to minimize the disturbance, and thus the disturbance propagates. Aerodynamicists struggled during the earlier studies of transonic flow because the then-current theory implied that these disturbances– and thus drag– approached infinity as local Mach number approached 1, an obviously unrealistic result which could not be remedied using known methods. 

One of the first methods used to circumvent the nonlinearity of transonic flow models was the hodograph transformation. This concept was originally explored in 1923 by an Italian mathematician named Francesco Tricomi, who used the transformation to simplify the compressible flow equations and prove that they were solvable. The hodograph transformation itself was also explored by both Ludwig Prandtl and O.G. Tietjen&#x27;s textbooks in 1929 and by Adolf Busemann in 1937, though neither applied this method specifically to transonic flow.

Gottfried Guderley, a German mathematician and engineer at Braunschweig, discovered Tricomi&#x27;s work in the process of applying the hodograph method to transonic flow near the end of World War II. He focused on the nonlinear thin-airfoil compressible flow equations, the same as what Tricomi derived, though his goal of using these equations to solve flow over an airfoil presented unique challenges. Guderley and Hideo Yoshihara, along with some input from Busemann, later used a singular solution of Tricomi&#x27;s equations to analytically solve the behavior of transonic flow over a double wedge airfoil, the first to do so with only the assumptions of thin-airfoil theory.

Although successful, Guderley&#x27;s work was still focused on the theoretical, and only resulted in a single solution for a double wedge airfoil at Mach 1. Walter Vincenti, an American engineer at Ames Laboratory, aimed to supplement Guderley&#x27;s Mach 1 work with numerical solutions that would cover the range of transonic speeds between Mach 1 and wholly supersonic flow. Vincenti and his assistants drew upon the work of Howard Emmons as well as Tricomi&#x27;s original equations to complete a set of four numerical solutions for the drag over a double wedge airfoil in transonic flow above Mach 1. The gap between subsonic and Mach 1 flow was later covered by both Julian Cole and Leon Trilling, completing the transonic behavior of the airfoil by the early 1950s. 

==Condensation clouds==
At transonic speeds supersonic expansion fans form intense low-pressure, low-temperature areas at various points around an aircraft. If the temperature drops below the dew point a visible cloud will form. These clouds remain with the aircraft as it travels. It is not necessary for the aircraft as a whole to reach supersonic speeds for these clouds to form. Typically, the tail of the aircraft will reach supersonic flight while the nose of the aircraft is still in subsonic flight. A bubble of supersonic expansion fans terminating by a wake shockwave surround the tail. As the aircraft continues to accelerate, the supersonic expansion fans will intensify and the wake shockwave will grow in size until infinity is reached, at which point the bow shockwave forms. This is Mach 1 and the Prandtl–Glauert singularity.

==Transonic flows in astronomy and astrophysics==

In astrophysics, wherever there is evidence of shocks (standing, propagating or oscillating), the flow close by must be transonic, as only supersonic flows form shocks. All black hole accretions are transonic. Many such flows also have shocks very close to the black holes.

The outflows or jets from young stellar objects or disks around black holes can also be transonic since they start subsonically and at a far distance they are invariably supersonic. Supernovae explosions are accompanied by supersonic flows and shock waves. Bow shocks formed in solar winds are a direct result of transonic winds from a star. It had been long thought that a bow shock was present around the heliosphere of our solar system, but this was found not to be the case according to IBEX data published in 2012.

<doc id="247746" wikidata="Q18129813" url="?curid=247746" title="Music of Egypt">
<text>Music has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity in Egypt. Egyptian music had a significant impact on the development of ancient Greek music, and via the Greeks it was important to early European music well into the Middle Ages. Due to the thousands of-years long dominance of Egypt over its neighbors, Egyptian culture, including music and musical instruments, was very influential in the surrounding regions; for instance, the instruments claimed in the Bible to have been played by the ancient Hebrews are all Egyptian instruments as established by Egyptian archaeology. Egyptian modern music is considered as a main core of Middle Eastern and Oriental music as it has a huge influence on the region due to the popularity and huge influence of Egyptian cinema and music industries, owing to the political influence Egypt has on its neighboring countries, as well as Egypt producing the most accomplished musicians and composers in the region, especially in the 20th century, many of them are of international stature. The tonal structure music in the East is defined by the maqamat, loosely similar to the Western modes, while the rhythm in the East is governed by the iqa&#x27;at, standard rhythmic modes formed by combinations of accented and unaccented beats and rests.

==History==
The ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat and the god Ihy with the invention of music. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of Hathor because both were depicted as cows. Hathor&#x27;s music was believed to have been used by Osiris as part of his effort to civilise the world. The lion-goddess Bastet was also considered a goddess of music in ancient Egypt.

===Neolithic period===
In prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals. Rhythms during this time were unvaried and music served to create rhythm. Small shells were used as whistles.

===Predynastic period===
During the predynastic period of Egyptian history, funerary chants continued to play an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers or a flute. Despite the lack of physical evidence in some cases, Egyptologists theorise that the development of certain instruments known of the Old Kingdom period, such as the end-blown flute, took place during this time.

===Old Kingdom===
The evidence for instruments played is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when arched harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today.

===Medieval music===

Early Middle Eastern music was influenced by Byzantine and Roman forms, which were themselves heavily influenced by earlier Greek, Semitic, and Ancient Egyptian music.

Egyptians in Medieval Cairo believed that music exercised &quot;too powerful an effect upon the passions, and leading men into gaiety, dissipation and vice.&quot; However, Egyptians generally were very fond of music. Though, according to E.W. Lane, no &quot;man of sense&quot; would ever become a musician, music was a key part of society. Tradesmen of every occupation used music during work and schools taught the Quran by chanting.

The music of Medieval Egypt was derived from Ancient Egyptian and Byzantine traditions. Lane said that &quot;the most remarkable peculiarity of the Arabic system of music is the division of tones into thirds,&quot; although today Western musicologists prefer to say that Arabic music&#x27;s tones are divided into quarters. The songs of this period were similar in sound and simple, within a small range of tones. Egyptian song, though simple in form, is embellished by the singer. Distinct enunciation and a quavering voice are also characteristics of Egyptian singing.

Male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means &quot;a player upon an instrument&quot;. However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. This position was considered disreputable and lowly. However, musicians found work singing or playing at parties to entertain the company. They generally made three shillings a night, but earned more by the guests&#x27; givings.

Female professional musicians were called Awalim (pl) or Al’meh, which means a learned female. These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the harem of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded than the Alateeyeh as well. Lane relates an instance of a female performer who so enraptured her audience that she earned up to fifty guineas for one night&#x27;s performance from the guests and host, themselves not considered wealthy.

===Modern Egyptian classical and pop music===
In the second half of the 19th century, the Egyptian folk street music band &quot;Hasaballah&quot;, a genre of popular improvisational brass band folk music emerged, initiated by clarinettist Mohamed Hasaballah and his band based on the traditional music of the Egyptians, and is shortly called Hasaballah, a band playing in Cairo&#x27;s music and entertainment quarter on Mohammed Ali Street. The typical line-up of trumpet, trombone, bass and snare drums, was popular, such as at family events, for well over a century, and is still played.

Egyptian music began to be recorded as early as in the 1910s. The Egyptians have always expressed themselves and daily lives and even struggles with their music and traditional folk music. By the 1930s, Egypt&#x27;s classical musical tradition was already thriving, centered on the city of Cairo. In general, modern Egyptian music blends its rich indigenous traditions, with some western elements that helped create Egyptian pop music.

Since the end of World War I, some of the Middle East&#x27;s biggest musical stars have been Egyptian. Contemporary classical Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of traditiondal classical Egyptian musicians Abdu El Hamouly, Almaz, and Mahmud Osman, as well as the later work of the 20th century&#x27;s most important Egyptian composers and singers, like Sayed Darwish, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Abdel Halim Hafez, and Baligh Hamdy. Most of these stars, including Umm Kulthum, Abdel Halim, Fawzi and many others were part of the traditional Egyptian music. Some, like Abd el-Halim Hafez, were associated with the Egyptian nationalist movement from 1952 onward.

Cairo-born Fatma Said was the first Egyptian soprano to sing at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. and from 2016 to 2018 took part in BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme.

==Western classical music==

Western classical music was introduced to Egypt, and, in the middle of the 18th century, instruments such as the piano and violin were gradually adopted by Egyptians. Opera also became increasingly popular during the 18th century, and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s Egyptian-themed &quot;Aida&quot; was premiered in Cairo on December 24, 1871.

By the early 20th century, the first generation of Egyptian composers, including Yusef Greiss, Abu Bakr Khairat, and Hasan Rashid, began writing for Western instruments. The second generation of Egyptian composers included notable artists such as Gamal Abdelrahim. Representative composers of the third generation are Ahmed El-Saedi and Rageh Daoud. In the early 21st century, even fourth generation composers such as Mohamed Abdelwahab Abdelfattah (of the Cairo Conservatory) have gained international attention.

==Religious music in Egypt==

Religious music remains an essential part of traditional Sufi Muslim and Coptic Christian celebrations called &quot;mulids&quot;. Mulids are held in Egypt to celebrate the saint of a particular church or an exalted local Muslim figure. Muslim mulids are related to the Sufi zikr ritual. The Egyptian flute, called the ney, is commonly played at mulids. The liturgical music of the Alexandrian Rite also constitutes an important element of Egyptian music and is said to have preserved many features of ancient Egyptian music.

==Folkloric music==

Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi &quot;dhikr&quot; rituals in Egypt, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms, and instruments.

==Folk and roots revival==

The 20th century has seen Cairo become associated with a roots revival. Musicians from across Egypt are keeping folk traditions alive, such as those of rural Egyptians (fellahin), the Saii&#x27;da, and to a lesser extent minorities like the Siwa people, the Egyptian Romani, the Sinawis and the Nubians. Mixtures of folk and pop have also risen from the Cairo hit factory.

Since the Nasser era, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other traditional festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues. Among some of the most popular Egyptian pop singers today are Sherine Abdel-Wahab, Mohamed Mounir, and Amr Diab.

&quot;Sawahli&quot; (coastal) music is a type of popular Egyptian music from the country&#x27;s northern coast, and is based around ancient Egyptian instrumentals, mainly the simsimiyya, which is an indigenous Egyptian stringed instrument that has its roots in ancient Egypt, it---the simsimiyya---was probably introduced to the country&#x27;s northern coast from the Nile valley in the 19th century by Egyptian workers in the Suez Canal. Well known Egyptian bands that feature the simsimiyya as a main instrument include el-Tanboura, which uses other ancient Egyptian instruments.

===Saidi (Upper Egyptian)===

Egyptian musicians from Upper Egypt play a form of folk music called Ṣa‘īdi which originates from Upper Egypt. Metqal Qenawi&#x27;s Les Musiciens du Nil (Musicians of the Nile; who became known to Alain Weber in 1975), are the most popular Sa‘īdi group, and were chosen by the government to represent Egyptian folk music abroad. They spent over three decades touring Europe performing at various festivals and musical events and in 1983 after their performance in the World of Music and Dance Festival, they were signed to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s label Real World-Carolina and went on to feature on his Album Passion. Other performers include Shoukoukou, Ahmad Ismail, Omar Gharzawi, Sohar Magdy and Ahmed Megahid.

===Nubian===

In Egypt, Nubians are native to southern part of Aswan, though some live in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities. Nubian folk music can still be heard, but migration and intercultural contact with Egyptian and other musical genres have produced new innovations. Ali Hassan Kuban&#x27;s efforts had made him a regular on the world music scene, while Mohamed Mounir&#x27;s social criticism and sophisticated pop have made him a star among Nubians, Egyptians, and other people worldwide. Ahmed Mounib, Mohamed Mounir&#x27;s mentor, was by far the most notable Nubian singer to hit the Egyptian music scene, singing in both Egyptian Arabic as well as in his native Nobiin. Hamza El Din was another popular Nubian Egyptian artist, well known on the world music scene and has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet.

==Egyptian musical instruments==
A typical early 20th century Egyptian ensemble comprising the Oud, qanun, violin, ney, and cello.

Many of the modern day instruments, both in the East and the West, trace their roots back to ancient Egypt, and many ancient Egyptian instruments are still used in Egypt today, such as the darbuka, the simsimiyya, the Egyptian ney, among other instruments.

During the Abbasid and Ottoman dynasty Egypt was one of the main musical hubs in the middle east and therefore after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1923 Egypt became the capital of music in the Arabic-speaking world where classical instruments such as the oud, qanun, and ney were widely used. The typical takht (ensemble) consisted of an Oud player, qanun player, ney player and violin player. The takht (literally meaning a sofa) was the most common form of ensembles in the early 20th century before the adoption of more orchestral instruments which were introduced by composers such as Mohamed El Qasabgi, Riad El Sunbati and Mohammed Abdel Wahab.

==Electronic music==

One of the most respected early electronic music composers, Halim El-Dabh, is an Egyptian. Active at the same time, or perhaps earlier than, the French electronic pioneers from the Studio d’Essai, he is one of, if not the, earliest composer of purely electronic music. In 1944 he composed the earliest known work of tape music, or musique concrète, called &quot;The Expression of Zar,&quot; which he composed in Egypt, while still a student in Cairo, by capturing sounds from the streets of Egypt on a wire recorder.

The Egyptian electronic music scene has gained a mainstream foothold in the forms of techno, trance, and dance pop DJs such as Aly &amp; Fila. In the 2010s, Mahraganat music, an Egyptian form of electronic music which often contains political lyrics, gained popularity both inside and outside Egypt.

==Reconstruction of ancient Egyptian music==

In the 20th and early 21st centuries, interest in the music of the pharaonic/ancient Egyptian period began to grow, inspired by the research of such foreign-born musicologists as Hans Hickmann, who lived and worked in Egypt. By the early 21st century, Egyptian musicians and musicologists led by the Egyptian musicology professor Khairy el-Malt at Helwan University in Cairo had begun to reconstruct musical instruments of ancient Egypt, a project that is ongoing.

<text>The Athabasca River (French: &quot;Rivière Athabasca&quot;) is a river in Alberta, Canada, which originates at the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and flows more than before emptying into Lake Athabasca. Much of the land along its banks is protected in national and provincial parks, and the river is designated a Canadian Heritage River for its historical and cultural importance. The scenic Athabasca Falls is located about upstream from Jasper.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Athabasca&quot; comes from the Woods Cree word , which means &quot;[where] there are plants one after another&quot;, likely a reference to the spotty vegetation along the river.

==Course==
The Athabasca River originates in Jasper National Park, in Lake Providence at the toe of the Columbia Glacier within the Columbia Icefield, between Mount Columbia, Snow Dome, and the Winston Churchill Range, at an elevation of approximately . It travels before draining into the Peace-Athabasca Delta near Lake Athabasca south of Fort Chipewyan. From there, its waters flow north as Rivière des Rochers, then join the Peace River to form the Slave River, which empties into the Great Slave Lake and discharges through the Mackenzie River system into the Arctic Ocean. The cumulative drainage area is .
The river flows along icefields and through gorges, offering wildlife habitat on its shores and in adjacent marshes. Throughout its course, it flows through or adjacent to numerous national and provincial parks, including Jasper National Park, Fort Assiniboine Sandhills Wildland Provincial Park, Hubert Lake Wildland Provincial Park, La Biche River Wildland Provincial Park, Grand Rapids Wildland Provincial Park, Richardson Wildland Provincial Park, and Wood Buffalo National Park. Its course is marked by rapids, impeding navigation southwest of Fort McMurray.

Numerous communities are on the banks of the Athabasca River, including Jasper, Brule, Entrance, Hinton, Whitecourt, Fort Assiniboine, Smith, Athabasca, Fort McMurray, and Fort McKay.

There are several crossings of the Athabasca River that are in use.

==History==

Sekani, Shuswap, Kootenay, Salish, Stoney, and Cree tribes hunted and fished along the river prior to European colonization in the 18th century. From about 1778, the Athabasca River, the Clearwater River, which enters the Athabasca River from the east at Fort McMurray, and the Methye Portage were part of a primary fur trade route from the Mackenzie River to the Great Lakes (see Canadian Canoe Routes (early)).
David Thompson and Thomas the Iroquois traveled through Athabasca Pass in 1811. In 1862, the Athabasca Springs area was crossed during the Cariboo Gold Rush by the Overlander Party.

The northern segment of the Athabasca River became part of a major shipping network in 1921 when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached Waterways near Fort McMurray, making it the northernmost point on the North American railroad grid at that time. Cargo for destinations farther north was shipped to Waterways and transferred to barges, after which fleets of tugboats took them up the river to destinations in the Athabasca and Mackenzie River watersheds. Barge traffic declined after 1964 when Hay River, on the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, became the northern terminus of the rail grid.

==Environmental concerns==
Owing to its proximity to the Athabasca oil sands, the river has seen significant amounts of energy infrastructure constructed along its course. On June 6, 1970, a pipeline operated by Great Canadian Oil Sands, the precursor to Suncor and the earliest commercial extraction operation, ruptured near the banks of the river. The total spill volume was estimated by Great Canadian Oil Sands at approximately .

In 2012, an independent study concluded that the Athabasca River contained elevated levels of pollution downstream of the Athabasca oil sands. Testing showed this portion of the river contained mercury, lead, and 11 other toxic elements.

In 2021, another independent research was conducted on the streamflow and climate data sets for the Athabasca River Basin showing the seasonality of the streamflow and precipitation time series via wavelet analysis. The seasonal components of these time series were shown to be coherent with phase discrepancy. The mean temperature had been gradually increasing since 1960, and it was projected to increase by approximately 2 °C during the mid-century, possibly reducing the snowpack volume during the spring.

===Coal mine spill===
On October31, 2013, a pit at the Obed Mountain coal mine spilled, and between 600 million and a billion litres of slurry poured into Plante and Apetowun Creeks. The plume of waste products then joined the Athabasca River, travelling downstream for a month before settling in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan, over away.

==Heritage==
The river was designated a Canadian heritage river for its importance to the fur trade and the construction of railways and roads opening up the Canadian West, as well as for its natural heritage. 
The Canadian Heraldic Authority named the position of Athabaska Herald after the river.

<text>The rivalry between Puerto Rican and Mexican boxers is recognized as one of the most intense in boxing history. Originating in 1934, this rivalry has been watched by fans across multiple generations. Over the years, both nations have raised numerous fighters who have competed in boxing matches against each other including Julio Cesar Chavez, Fenix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya, Miguel Cotto, and Hector Camacho. It has said to have started when Sixto Escobar became the first Puerto Rican champion by knocking out Mexican champion Rodolfo &quot;Baby&quot; Casanova.

In world title matches, Puerto Rican boxers hold a slight statistical advantage over their Mexican rivals, with Puerto Rico achieving 84 wins compared to Mexico with 73 wins.

The most recent major boxing fight between a Mexican and Puerto Rican boxer was a 12 round bout between Canelo Alvarez (Mexico) and Edgar Berlanga (Puerto Rico), which took place on September 14 2024 with Canelo winning by unanimous decision continuing the rivalry.

<doc id="247752" wikidata="Q1752483" url="?curid=247752" title="Sedgemoor">
<text>Sedgemoor is a low-lying area of land in Somerset, England. It lies close to sea level south of the Polden Hills, historically largely marsh (or &quot;moor&quot; in its older sense). The eastern part is known as King&#x27;s Sedgemoor, and the western part West Sedgemoor. Sedgemoor is part of the area now known as the Somerset Levels and Moors. Historically the area was known as the site of the Battle of Sedgemoor.

Sedgemoor gave its name to a local government district formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the municipal borough of Bridgwater, the Burnham-on-Sea urban district, Bridgwater Rural District and part of Axbridge Rural District. The district covered a larger area than the historical Sedgemoor, extending north of the Polden Hills across the Somerset Levels and Moors to the Mendip Hills.

On 1 April 2023 the district was abolished and replaced by a new unitary district for the area previously served by Somerset County Council. The replacement council is Somerset Council.
Elections for the new council took place in May 2022, and it ran alongside Sedgemoor and the other councils until their abolition in April 2023.

==Toponymy==
Sedgemoor does not mean &quot;sedge moor&quot;, but is instead &quot;marsh of a man called Sicga&quot; from the Old Norse personal name Sicga and Old English mor &quot;moor&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Secgamere&quot; in 1165.

==Towns==

*Bridgwater – the administrative centre
*Burnham-on-Sea
*North Petherton
*Highbridge
*Axbridge
*Cheddar

==Parishes==
==Rivers==

*River Parrett
*River Brue
*River Huntspill
*King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain

==Battles==
*Battle of Sedgemoor 1685

==Industry==
Light industry now predominates, but traditional trades including peat extraction, willow crafts and cider making may still be found, in addition to livestock farming. The River Parrett provides a source of eels (anguilla anguilla) and elvers from January through to May.

Also notable is the new Isleport trading estate at Highbridge, which houses many global businesses such as Geest (Isleport Foods) who make yoghurt under franchise to Ski &amp; Muller, Brake Brothers who supply the catering trade, BFP wholesale who supply dry goods to bakeries etc., Woodbury &amp; Haines who supply furniture globally, Polybeam Limited who supply GRP radio masts to customers such as Marconi, and also AT&amp;T whose centre there controls all internet cable traffic to and from the US.

Industry in Bridgwater has also seen major growth recently with the opening of &quot;Express Park&quot; which houses Gerber Foods (a global fruit juice supplier), NHS Logistics depot and Eddie Stobart depot.

==Governance==

===Sedgemoor District Council===

The Sedgemoor district was established in 1974 and was based in Bridgwater. It covers a mostly rural area between the Quantock Hills and the Mendip Hills. The council, along with Somerset County Council, was replaced in April 2023 by Somerset Council, a unitary authority.

==Education==

Schools (those which are not independent) in Sedgemoor are operated the Children &amp; Young People&#x27;s Directorate of Somerset County Council, although some such as The Kings of Wessex School in Cheddar have distanced themselves from the county council by opting for foundation and then subsequently academy status.

<doc id="247756" wikidata="Q277393" url="?curid=247756" title="Music of China">
<text>The music of China consists of many distinct traditions, often specifically originating with one of the country&#x27;s various ethnic groups. It is produced within and without the country, involving either people of Chinese origin, the use of traditional Chinese instruments, Chinese music theory, or the languages of China. It includes traditional classical forms and indigenous folk music, as well as recorded popular music and forms inspired by Western culture.

Documents and archaeological artifacts from early Chinese civilization show a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122–256 BC) that set the tone for the continual development of Chinese musicology in following dynasties. These developed into a wide variety of forms through succeeding dynasties, producing the heritage that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today. Traditional forms continued to evolve in the modern times, and over the course of the last centuries forms appropriated from the West have become widespread. Today&#x27;s Chinese music is both rooted in history and part of a global culture.

== History ==
According to legends, the founder of music in Chinese mythology was Ling Lun who, at the request of the Yellow Emperor to create a system of music, made bamboo pipes tuned to the sounds of birds including the phoenix. A twelve-tone musical system was created based on the pitches of the bamboo pipes, the first of these pipes produced the &#x27;yellow bell&#x27; () pitch, and a set of tuned bells were then created from the pipes.

=== Early history ===


Archaeological evidence indicates that music culture developed in China from a very early period. Excavations in Jiahu Village in Wuyang County, Henan found bone flutes dated to 9,000 years ago, and clay music instruments called Xun thought to be 7,000 years old have been found in the Hemudu sites in Zhejiang and Banpo in Xi&#x27;an.

During the Zhou dynasty, a formal system of court and ceremonial music later termed &quot;yayue&quot; (meaning &quot;elegant music&quot;) was established. The word music (, &quot;yue&quot;) in ancient China can also refer to dance as music and dance were considered integral part of the whole, and its meaning can also be further extended to poetry as well as other art forms and rituals. The word &quot;dance&quot; () similarly also referred to music, and every dance would have had a piece of music associated with it. The most important set of music of the period was the Six-dynasty Music Dance () performed in rituals in the royal court. Music in the Zhou dynasty was conceived as a cosmological manifestation of the sound of nature integrated into the binary universal order of yin and yang, and this concept has had an enduring influence over later Chinese thinking on music. &quot;Correct&quot; music according to Zhou concept would involve instruments correlating to the five elements of nature and would bring harmony to nature. Around or before the 7th century BC, a system of pitch generation and pentatonic scale was derived from a cycle-of-fifths theory.

Chinese philosophers took varying approaches to music. To Confucius, a correct form of music is important for the cultivation and refinement of the individual, and the Confucian system considers the formal music &quot;yayue&quot; to be morally uplifting and the symbol of a good ruler and stable government. Some popular forms of music, however, were considered corrupting in the Confucian view. Mozi on the other hand condemned making music, and argued in &quot;Against Music&quot; () that music is an extravagance and indulgence that serves no useful purpose and may be harmful. According to Mencius, a powerful ruler once asked him whether it was moral if he preferred popular music to the classics. The answer was that it only mattered that the ruler loved his subjects.

In ancient China the social status of musicians was much lower than that of painters, though music was seen as central to the harmony and longevity of the state. Almost every emperor took folk songs seriously, sending officers to collect songs to record the popular culture. One of the Confucianist Classics, The Classic of Poetry, contained many folk songs dating from 800 BC to about 400 BC.

=== Imperial China ===


The Imperial Music Bureau, first established in the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), was greatly expanded under the emperor Han Wudi (140–87 BC) and charged with supervising court music and military music and determining what folk music would be officially recognized. In subsequent dynasties, the development of Chinese music was influenced by the musical traditions of Central Asia which also introduced elements of Indian music. Instruments of Central Asian origin such as pipa were adopted in China, the Indian Heptatonic scale was introduced in the 6th century by a musician from Kucha named Sujiva, although the heptatonic scale was later abandoned.

The oldest extant written Chinese music is &quot;Youlan&quot; () or the Solitary Orchid, composed during the 6th or 7th century, but has also been attributed to Confucius. The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the qin during the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty. This is based on the conjecture that because the recorded examples of Chinese music are ceremonial, and the ceremonies in which they were employed are thought to have existed &quot;perhaps more than one thousand years before Christ&quot;, the musical compositions themselves were performed, even in 1000 BC, in precisely the manner prescribed by the sources that were written down in the seventh century AD. (It is based on this conjecture that Van Aalst dates the &quot;Entrance Hymn for the Emperor&quot; to c. 1000 BC.)

Through succeeding dynasties over thousands of years, Chinese musicians developed a large assortment of different instruments and playing styles. A wide variety of these instruments, such as guzheng and dizi are indigenous, although many popular traditional musical instruments were introduced from Central Asia, such as the erhu and pipa.

The presence of European music in China appeared as early as 1601 when the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci presented a Harpsichord to the Ming imperial court, and trained four eunuchs to play it. During the late Qing dynasty era, the influence of Western music began to be felt.

=== Republican era (1912–1949) ===

The New Culture Movement of the 1910s and 1920s produced a great deal of lasting interest in Western music. A number of Chinese musicians returned from studying abroad to perform Western classical music, composing work hits on Western musical notation system. The Kuomintang tried to sponsor modern music adoptions via the Shanghai Conservatory of Music despite the ongoing political crisis. Twentieth-century cultural philosophers like Xiao Youmei, Cai Yuanpei, Feng Zikai and Wang Guangqi wanted to see Chinese music adopted to the best standard possible. There were many different opinions regarding the best standard.

Symphony orchestras were formed in most major cities and performed to a wide audience in the concert halls and on radio. Many of the performers added jazz influences to traditional music, adding xylophones, saxophones and violins, among other instruments. Lü Wencheng, Qui Hechou, Yin Zizhong and He Dasha were among the most notable performers and composers of this period.

In Shanghai, a popular genre of music called &quot;shidaiqu&quot; emerged in the 1920s. &quot;Shidaiqu&quot; is a fusion of Chinese and Western popular music, and Li Jinhui is considered to be founder of the genre. Popular singers in this genre in the 1930s and 1940s included Zhou Xuan, Li Xianglan and Yao Lee.

After the 1942 Yan&#x27;an Forum on Literature and Art, a large-scale campaign was launched in Chinese Communist Party-controlled areas to adapt folk music to create revolutionary songs to educate the largely illiterate rural population on party goals. Musical forms considered superstitious or anti-revolutionary were repressed, and harmonies and bass lines were added to traditional songs. One example is The East Is Red, a folksong from northern Shaanxi which was adapted into a nationalist hymn. Of particular note is the composer, Xian Xinghai, who was active during this period, and composed the Yellow River Cantata which is the most well-known of all of his works.

=== Post-revolution ===
==== 1949–1999 ====

The golden age of shidaiqu and the Seven great singing stars would come to an end when the CCP denounced Chinese popular music as yellow music (pornography). Maoists considered pop music as a decline to the art form in mainland China. In 1949 the Kuomintang relocated to Taiwan, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established. Revolutionary songs would become heavily promoted by the state. The Maoists, during the Cultural Revolution, pushed revolutionary music as the only acceptable genre; because of propaganda, this genre largely overshadowed all others and came almost to define mainland Chinese music. This is still, in some ways, an ongoing process, but some scholars and musicians (Chinese and otherwise) are trying to revive old music.

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, a new fast tempo Northwest Wind style was launched by protesters to counter the government. The music would progress into Chinese rock, which remained popular in the 1990s. However, music in China is very much state-owned as the TV, media, and major concert halls are all controlled by the CCP. The government mainly chose not to support Chinese rock by limiting its exposure and airtime. As a result, the genre never reached the mainstream in its entirety.

==== 2000–present ====

Annual events such as the Midi Modern Music Festival in Beijing attracts tens of thousands of visitors. There was also the &quot;Snow Mountain Music Festival&quot; in Yunnan province 2002.

Today, rock music is centered on almost exclusively in Beijing and Shanghai, and has very limited influence over Chinese society. Wuhan and Sichuan are sometimes considered pockets of rock music culture as well. It points to a significant cultural, political, and social difference that exist between China, the West, or even different parts within China. While rock has existed in China for decades, the milestone that put the genre on the international map is when Cui Jian played with The Rolling Stones in 2003, at the age of 42. China has also become a destination of major Western rock and pop artists; many foreign acts have toured in China and performed in multiple concerts in recent decades, including Beyoncé, Eric Clapton, Nine Inch Nails, Avril Lavigne, Linkin Park and Talib Kweli.

Mainland China has a high piracy rate along with issues of intellectual properties. Normally there is some delay before the products are released into mainland China, with occasional exceptions, such as the work of Cui Jian, which was released in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China simultaneously. Consequently, a delay in release time is also the biggest driver of piracy, since individuals would rather pirate from the outside. The modern market is not only hindered by rights issues, as there are many other factors such as profit margin, income and other economical questions.

In 2015, the digital music market in China was expected to be worth . In 2015 China had the 14th largest music market in the world, with revenues of . As of 2016 there were 213 music charts in China. Also as of 2016, the three largest music streaming and download services in China are KuGou, with a 28% share of the market, QQ Music with 15% and Kuwo with 13%. China was expected to become one of the largest music markets in the world by 2020.

== Traditional music ==
=== Instrumental ===

Musical instruments were traditionally classified into eight categories known as &quot;bayin&quot;. Traditional music in China is played on solo instruments or in small ensembles of plucked and bowed stringed instruments, flutes, and various cymbals, gongs, and drums. The scale is pentatonic. Bamboo pipes and qin are among the oldest known musical instruments from China; instruments are traditionally divided into categories based on their material of composition: animal skins, gourd, bamboo, wood, silk, earth/clay, metal, and stone. Chinese orchestras traditionally consist of bowed strings, woodwinds, plucked strings and percussion. Under Xi Jinping, the current General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, traditional musical instruments have enjoyed a state-backed revival.
:Instruments
::* Woodwind
:::dizi, xiao, suona, sheng, paixiao, guan, hulusi, bawu, xun
::* Percussion
:::paigu, gong, bells, cymbals, bianzhong, fangxiang, paiban, bianqing
::* Bowed strings

::* Plucked and struck strings
:::guqin, sanxian, yueqin, yangqin, guzheng, ruan, konghou, liuqin, pipa, zhu
Chinese vocal music has traditionally been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in falsetto and is usually solo rather than choral. All traditional Chinese music is melodic rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an erhu or dizi are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the pipa and zheng music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The qin is perhaps the most revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or seen and heard one being played. The zheng, a form of zither, is most popular in Henan, Chaozhou, Hakka areas, and Shandong. The pipa, a kind of lute, believed to have been introduced from the Arabian Peninsula area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in Shanghai and surrounding areas.

=== Music of the Han culture ===
People of the Han ethnic group make up about 92% of the population of China. Han people&#x27;s music consists of heterophonic music, in which the musicians play versions of a single melodic line. Percussion accompanies most music, dance, talks, and opera. Han folk music had many aspects to it regarding its meaning, feelings, and tonality. This genre of music, in a sense, is similar to the Chinese language. This relationship is made by tones, sliding from higher tones to lower tones, or lower to higher tones, or a combination of both. These similarities mean that the instrument is a very important part in mastering technique with both left and right hands (left hand is used to create tonality on the string, right hand is for plucking or strumming the string), particularly for the classical (literati) tradition. Sometimes, singing can be put into the music to create a harmony or a melody accompanying the instrument. Han Chinese Folk&#x27;s feelings are displayed in its poetry-like feeling to it with slow soothing tempos that express feelings that connect with the audience or whoever is playing the piece. Han folk music uses silences that alter its meaning, creating a sound similar to poetry.

=== Chinese opera ===

Chinese opera is a comprehensive stage art that integrates literature, music, dance, martial arts, acrobatics, performance, and other artistic means. The basic skills are &quot;chang&quot; (), &quot;nian&quot; (), &quot;zuo&quot; (, and &quot;da&quot; (). Characters are divided into &quot;sheng&quot; (), male lead roles), &quot;dan&quot; (, female lead roles), &quot;jing&quot; (, roles with face painting), &quot;chou&quot; (, clown roles). Chinese opera music is mainly composed of singing (vocal singing and aside) and instrumental accompaniment.

Chinese opera accent: There are different types of drama in different regions, but they all have similarities. The four major accents in modern times are Kunshan accent (Kunshan), high accent (Yiyang), Pihuang accent, and Bangzi accent.

Kunshan accent: Popular in Jiangsu, Kunshan, and Wei Liangfu reforms in the Ming dynasty during the original Song and Yuan dynasties. The accent voice is soft and delicate. It later developed into South kun accent and North Kun accent. Southkun accent dialect is popular in Jiangnan and Zhebei, and there are more literary operas, using five-tone tones. Nouthkun accent dialect is popular in Beijing, Baoding, music is extravagant, and used seven-tone style.

Gao accent: Formed in China Yiyang County, Jiangxi at the end of the Yuan dynasty. The main ones are Sichuan opera high accent, Xiang opera high accent, Gan opera high accent, Fujian siping opera. Only percussion accompaniment, no orchestra, five-tone style.

Bangzi accent: also known as &quot;Xiqin&quot; or &quot;Luantan&quot;, because the music uses hardwood clappers, it is also called Bangzi tune. Originated from Northwest China. Mainly in seven tones. High-pitched and agitated, tragic and rough. The types of opera include Qin Opera, Jin Opera, Henan Opera, and Hebei Bangzi.

Pi Huang accent: It is an opera tune formed by the integration of the southeast and northwest regions of China. Composed of &quot;Xipi&quot; and &quot;Erhuang&quot;. The main types of operas are Peking Opera (Beijing), Han Opera (Hubei), Cantonese Opera (Guangdong), Gui Opera (Guangxi), and Yunnan Opera (Yunnan).

=== Folk music ===

According to current archaeological discoveries, Chinese folk music dates back 7,000 years. Not only in form but also in artistic conception, China has been the home of a colorful culture of folk music. Largely based on the pentatonic scale, Chinese folk music is different from western traditional music, paying more attention to the form expression as well.

Han traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of oboe called a suona and percussive ensembles called &quot;chuigushou&quot;. Ensembles consisting of mouth organs (sheng), shawms (suona), flutes (dizi) and percussion instruments (especially yunluo gongs) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of Beijing, Xi&#x27;an, Wutai shan and Tianjin. Xi&#x27;an drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi&#x27;an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the sheng, pipes, an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western free reed instruments, such as the accordion. Parades led by Western-type brass bands are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.

In southern Fujian and Taiwan, Nanyin or Nanguan is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a xiao and a pipa, as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken woman. Further south, in Shantou, Hakka areas, and Chaozhou, erxian and zheng ensembles are popular.

Sizhu ensembles use flutes and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in Nanjing and Hangzhou, as well as elsewhere along the southern Yangtze area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.

Jiangnan Sizhu (silk and bamboo music from Jiangnan) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in Shanghai; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin.

Guangdong Music or Cantonese Music is instrumental music from Guangzhou and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories and myths, maybe legends.

== Regional music ==
China has many ethnic groups besides the Han, who reside in various regions around the nation. These include Tibetans, Uyghurs, Manchus, Zhuang, Dai, Mongolians, Naxi, Miao, Wa, Yi, and Lisu.

=== Guangxi ===

Guangxi is a region of China, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Its most famous performer of Guangxi is the legendary Zhuang folksinger, () or Third Sister Liu, born in Guangxi during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) and who was the subject of the 1961 film, Liu Sanjie which introduced Guangxi&#x27;s culture to the rest of the world.

Zhuang folk songs and Han Chinese music are a similar style, and are mostly in the pentatonic scale. The lyrics have an obvious antithesis format. They frequently contain symbols and metaphors, and common themes include life experiences as well as allusions to classical Chinese stories.

The Jing or Gin people (ethnic Vietnamese) are one of the smallest populations of ethnic and the only coastal fishery ethnic minority of China. They are known for their instrument called &quot;duxianqin&quot; (lit. &quot;single string zither&quot;), a string instrument with only one string, said to date back to the 8th century.

=== Hong Kong ===

The music of Hong Kong notably includes the Cantonese Chinese pop music known as cantopop.

=== Hua&#x27;er ===
&quot;Hua&#x27;er&quot; is a form of traditional a cappella singing that is popular in the mountainous northwestern Chinese provinces such as Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai.

=== Inner Mongolia ===
Mongolian folk songs have a &quot;long tune&quot; and a &quot;short tune&quot;. The Mongolians have a variety of stringed instruments such as morin khuur or horsehead fiddle. It is named because of its headstock carving of a horse used as decoration on the pillar.

=== Kuaiban ===
&quot;Kuaiban&quot; is a type of rhythmic talking and singing which is often performed with percussive instruments such as a clapper called &quot;paiban&quot;. The center of the &quot;kuaiban&quot; tradition is Shandong province. &quot;Kuaiban&quot; bears some resemblance to rap and other forms of rhythmic music found in other cultures.

=== Northeast China ===
Northeast China is a region inhabited by ethnic groups like the Manchu. The most prominent folk instrument is the octagonal drum, while the youyouzha lullaby is also well-known.

=== Sichuan ===
Sichuan is a province in southwest China. Its capital city, Chengdu, is home to the only musical higher education institution in the region, the Sichuan Conservatory of Music. The province has a long history of Sichuan opera.

=== Tibet ===
Music forms an integral part of Tibetan Buddhism. While chanting remains perhaps the best known form of Tibetan Buddhist music, complex and lively forms are also widespread. Monks use music to recite various sacred texts and to celebrate a variety of festivals during the year. The most specialized form of chanting is called yang, which is without metrical timing and is dominated by resonant drums and sustained, low syllables. Other forms of chanting are unique to Tantra as well as the four main monastic schools: Gelugpa, Kagyupa, Nyingmapa and Sakyapa. Of these schools, Gelugpa is considered a more restrained, classical form, while Nyingmapa is widely described as romantic and dramatic. Gelugpa is perhaps the most popular.

Secular Tibetan music survived the Cultural Revolution more intact than spiritual music, especially due to the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts, which was founded by the Dalai Lama shortly after his exile. TIPA originally specialized in the operatic lhamo form, which has since been modernized with the addition of Western and other influences. Other secular genres include nangma and toshe, which are often linked and are accompanied by a variety of instruments designed for highly rhythmic dance music. Nangma karaoke is popular in modern Lhasa. A classical form called gar is very popular, and is distinguished by ornate, elegant and ceremonial music honoring dignitaries or other respected persons.

Tibetan folk music includes a cappella lu songs, which are distinctively high in pitch with glottal vibrations, as well as now rare epic bards who sing the tales of Gesar, Tibet&#x27;s most popular hero.

Tibetan music has influenced the pioneering compositions of Philip Glass and, most influentially, Henry Eichheim. Later artists made new-age fusions by pioneers Henry Wolff and Nancy Hennings. These two collaborated on &quot;Tibetan Bells&quot;, perhaps the first fusion of New Age and Tibetan influences, in 1971. Glass&#x27; &quot;Kundun&quot; soundtrack proved influential in the 1990s, while the popularity of Western-adapted Buddhism (exemplified by Richard Gere, Yungchen Lhamo, Steve Tibbetts, Choying Drolma, Lama Karta and Kitaro and Nawang Khechong) helped further popularize Tibetan music.

In the mid- to late 1980s, a relaxation of governmental rules allowed a form of Tibetan pop music to emerge in Tibet proper. Direct references to native religion is still forbidden, but commonly understood metaphors are widespread. Pure Tibetan pop is heavily influenced by light Chinese rock, and includes best-sellers like Jampa Tsering and Yatong. Politically and socially aware songs are rare in this form of pop, but commonplace in a second type of Tibetan pop. Nangma karaoke bars appeared in 1998 and are common in Lhasa, in spite of threats from the Chinese government.

=== Xinjiang ===

Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is dominated by Uyghurs, a Turkic people related to other Turkic groups from Central Asia. The Uyghurs&#x27; best-known musical form is the On Ikki Muqam, a complex suite of twelve sections related to Uzbek and Tajik forms. These complex symphonies vary wildly between suites in the same muqam, and are built on a seven-note scale. Instruments typically include dap (a drum), dulcimers, fiddles and lutes; performers have some space for personal embellishments, especially in the percussion. The most important performer is Turdi Akhun, who recorded most of the muqams in the 1950s.

=== Yunnan ===

Yunnan is an ethnically diverse area in southwest China. Perhaps best known from the province is the lusheng, a type of mouth organ, used by the Miao people of Guizhou for pentatonic antiphonal courting songs.

The Hani of Honghe Prefecture are known for a unique kind of choral, micro-tonal rice-transplanting songs.

The Nakhi of Lijiang play a type of song and dance suite called baisha xiyue, which was supposedly brought by Kublai Khan in 1253. Nakhi &quot;Dongjing&quot; is a type of music related to southern Chinese forms, and is popular today.

The Dai ethnic musical styles are similar to those of South Asia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Some typical Dai instruments are the hulusi and the elephant-foot drum.

== Modern changes ==
In the early 20th century after the end of Imperial China, there were major changes to traditional Chinese music as part of the New Culture Movement. Much of what Westerners and even Chinese now consider to be music in the traditional Chinese style can be dated to this period and is in fact less than 100 years old. The modernization of Chinese music involved the adoption of some aspects of Western forms and values, such as the use of Western conservatory system of teaching, and changes to the instruments and their tuning, the composition, the orchestration of music, the notation system and performance style. Some forms of Chinese music however remained traditional and are little changed.

=== National music ===
The term &quot;guoyue&quot;, or national music, became popular in the early 20th century and was used loosely to include all music written for Chinese instruments in response to a particular nationalistic consciousness. The term however may have a slightly different meaning when used by different Chinese communities. It was originally used only to refer to the music of the Han Chinese; it later began to include music of various ethnic minorities in China. In the Republic of China in Taiwan, &quot;Guoyue&quot; emphasized music of the mainland China over the Taiwanese local traditions. In mainland China a new term &quot;minyue&quot; (, short for &quot;minzu yinyue&quot; or &quot;people&#x27;s music&quot;) was coined post-1949 in place of &quot;guoyue&quot; to encompass all compositions and genres for traditional instruments. In other Chinese communities, it may also be referred to as &quot;huayue&quot; (for example in Singapore) or &quot;zhongyue&quot; (in Hong Kong).
=== Chinese orchestra ===
There was a tradition of massed instruments in the ritual court music form known as &quot;yayue&quot; since the Zhou dynasty. This music may be played by a handful of musicians, or there may be more than 200 for example during the Song dynasty. During the Tang dynasty there were also large-scale presentations of banquet music called &quot;yanyue&quot; () in the court. The Tang imperial court may have up to ten different orchestras, each performing a different kind of music. It also had a large outdoor band of nearly 1,400 performers.

The modern Chinese orchestra however was created in the 20th century modeled on Western symphony orchestra using Chinese instruments. In the traditional &quot;yanyue&quot;, a single dominant melodic line was favored, but the new music and arrangements of traditional melodies created for this modern orchestra is more polyphonic in nature.

=== Instruments and tuning ===
Many traditional instruments underwent changes in the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western equal temperament is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their traditional voices. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound out of tune and discordant.

In order to accommodate Western system, changes were made to the instruments, for example in the &quot;pipa&quot; the number of frets was increased to 24, based on the 12 tone equal temperament scale, with all the intervals being semitones.

There is also a need to standardize the tuning when the instruments are played in an orchestra, which in turn may also affect how the instrument is made. For example, traditionally &quot;dizi&quot; is made by using a solid piece of bamboo which made it impossible to change the fundamental tuning once the bamboo is cut. This issue was resolved in the 1920s by the insertion of a copper joint to connect two pieces of shorter bamboo, which allows the length of the bamboo to be modified so that minute adjustment to its fundamental pitch can be made. The Xindi, &quot;new flute&quot;, is a 1930s redesign of the Chinese flute incorporating western influences on the basis of equal temperament.

In order to achieve a greater vibrancy and loudness with instruments (not to mention longevity), many string instruments are no longer strung with silk but with steel or nylon. For example, metal strings began to be used in place of the traditional silk ones in the 1950s for &quot;pipa&quot;, resulting in a change in the sound of the &quot;pipa&quot; which became brighter and stronger.

=== Notation ===

Before the 20th century Chinese used the gongche notation system, in modern times the Jianpu system is common. Western staff notation however is also used.

=== Performance ===
In common with the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of traditional Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as qupai, in which tempo and ornamentation vary according to the mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their reaction to what is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the Butterfly Lovers&#x27; Violin Concerto where the same melody at different points in the lover&#x27;s story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a score in a standard way rather than in the changeable reflective individual way of tradition, this can at times lead to the feeling that a performance has been rushed.

== Modern popular music ==

=== Pop music ===

Chinese popular music found its beginnings in the &quot;shidaiqu&quot; genre. The shidaiqu genre was founded by Li Jinhui in mainland China and was influenced by Western jazz artists like Buck Clayton. After the Chinese Communist Revolution, popular music were denounced as Yellow Music, a form of pornography. and record companies of Shanghai such as Baak Doi in 1952 left China. Mainland China was left on the sidelines in the development of pop music for a few decades, as the Chinese pop music industry moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Taiwan. The 1970s saw the rise of cantopop in Hong Kong, and mandopop in its neighboring country Taiwan.

In the late 1970s, economic reforms by Deng Xiaoping in mainland China led to the introduction of gangtai culture of Hong Kong and Taiwan, and pop music returned to mainland China. However, for a time the government still have a censorious attitude toward pop music; for example, Hong Kong&#x27;s icon Anita Mui was banned from returning to the mainland concert stage after performing the song &quot;Bad Girl&quot; during the 1990s in China as punishment for what the Chinese government called her rebellious attitude. Nevertheless, pop music continued to increase in popularity in mainland China, and by 2005, China had overtaken Taiwan in term of the retail value of its music sales. The beginning of the 21st century has seen an increasing number of mainland Chinese artists who produced a wide range of Mandarin pop songs and the release of many new albums. However, despite having a much larger population and increasing consumption of Chinese pop music, China is not yet considered a major production hub of pop music.

Many popular mainland Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese music artists were included in promotions for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

=== Hip hop and rap ===
Mandarin rap music gradually became popular in mainland China, especially in Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and Sichuan where pop culture is very diverse and modern. Although Chinese perform rap in different dialects and languages, most Chinese hip hop artists perform in China&#x27;s most popular language: Mandarin.

Cantonese rap is also very diverse in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

=== Electronic music ===

Electronic dance music (EDM) has become the second biggest music category in China. Among the sub-genres, house music is at the top, followed by bass music and trap music. Reality talent shows and competition programs such as Rave Now and E-Pop of China contributed to promote electronic music towards the mainstream audience.

In recent years, numerous of local Chinese electronic music producers have emerged and got signed by international major labels. Chace, the first Chinese disc jockey (DJ) to play on the main stage of Tomorrowland, has been signed by Universal Music Group. Young Chinese DJ Carta has been signed by Spinnin&#x27; Records, listing himself on the DJ Mag Top 100.

A growing number of Chinese producers seek to collaborate with renowned foreign musicians and singers from the Western world. Local electronic music producer Zight collaborated with American singer Chris Willis and Italian DJ duo Maximals to release single &quot;Work It Harder&quot;. At the meantime, local electronic singer-songwriter has teamed up with Swedish DJ Alesso, releasing their global hit Going Dumb.

== Rock and heavy metal ==

The Peking All-Stars were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979, by foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital.

The widely acknowledged forefather of Chinese rock is Cui Jian. In the late 1980s he played the first Chinese rock song called: &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; (&quot;Yi wu suo you&quot;). It was the first time an electric guitar was used in China. He became the most famous performer of the time, and by 1988 he performed at a concert broadcast worldwide in conjunction with the Seoul Summer Olympic Games. His socially critical lyrics earned him the anger of the government and many of his concerts were banned or cancelled. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he played with a red blindfold around his head as an action against the government.

Afterwards, two bands became famous Hei Bao (Black Panther) and Tang Dynasty. Both started during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hei Bao is an old-school rock band whose first CD, &quot;Hei Bao&quot; used the popular English song (&quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart&quot;). Tang Dynasty was the first Chinese heavy metal band. Its first CD &quot;A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty&quot; combines elements of traditional Chinese opera and old school heavy metal. The album was a major breakthrough releasing around 1991/1992.

Around 1994–96: the first thrash metal band, Chao Zai (Overload), was formed. They released three CDs, the last one in cooperation with pop singer Gao Chi of the split-up band The Breathing. At the same time the first nu metal bands were formed and inspired by Western bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park. China would have their own with Yaksa, Twisted Machine, AK-47, Overheal Tank.

Black metal is becoming a prominent scene in mainland China, particularly central China.

=== Punk rock and post-punk ===
Punk rock first emerged in China in the early 1990s as records from Western punk and post-punk bands were imported into mainland China for the first time. One of the earliest and most renowned punk-influenced Chinese artists was He Yong whose debut album &quot;Garbage Dump&quot; was released in 1994.

Formed in Nanjing in 1997, post-punk group P.K. 14 are regarded as the most important band in the development of Chinese experimental rock music. The band moved to Beijing in 2001 and released their first album &#x27;Upstairs, Turn Left&#x27; the same year. P.K. 14&#x27;s singer-songwriter Yang Haisong () has also produced many of the Chinese indie music scene&#x27;s most celebrated albums (including Carsick Cars&#x27; 2007 eponymous debut album), working with independent record labels such as Maybe Mars and Modern Sky.

UnderBaby rose to fame underground in the mid-1990s, laying the foundation for Beijing punk music in the 1990s along with two garage bands, Flies and Catchers of the Rye. In 1996, UnderBaby&#x27;s song &quot;All the Same&quot; - &quot;All One Yang&quot; was included in the Chinese indie rock album &quot;China Fire II&quot;, thus gaining national recognition.

Since the early 2000s, Chinese indie music has grown considerably, with homegrown bands such as Carsick Cars, Birdstriking, Re-TROS, Brain Failure, Demerit, Tookoo, AV Okubo, Lonely Leary, Hang on the Box and Fanzui Xiangfa all embarking on international tours.

== Western classical music ==
Whereas orchestras organised by, run solely by and nearly always exclusive to the expatriate community in China are recorded from the early days of the International Settlement in Shanghai (i.e. 1850s) and a Russian orchestra was in operation in Harbin from the early 20th century, the beginnings of a unique classical music tradition in China lie with the first foreign trained Chinese conductor, Zheng Zhisheng AKA (romanized) Yin Zizhong. Zheng (Yin or Wan depending on romanization) was raised in China&#x27;s Guangdong province. He was influenced by the Western Church Music at an early age. He studied in Lyons and Paris before returning to China in the 1930s. He became the first Chinese conductor of the Chongqing Symphonic Orchestra. Their performances included compositions from Beethoven and Mozart.

The revolutionary spirit of Yin Zizhong&#x27;s (or romanized Wan-Chi Chung&#x27;s) style has been continued by the first generation of composers immediately following the accession of the CCP to power, namely Li Delun and Cao Peng. The former provided the driving force and often the life force that kept a tradition alive through the Mao years, especially in his adopted city of Beijing, and the latter has been instrumental in maintaining a high standard of symphonic music, as well as working hard for the popularization of the tradition further into the fabric of Chinese culture, across his long career, which continues to the present. At the same time as this tradition has continued, new generations have sought to bring classical music in China along another path, away from the strict professionalism of the elite trained Li and Cao (who were both at the Russian conservatory in the 1950s) and towards a less nationalistic, but arguably more encompassing attitude towards the tradition. Most influential in this new movement has been the young Shanghai conductor Long Yu.

== Patriotic / revolutionary music ==

During the height of the Cultural Revolution, political music became the dominant form. Music accelerated at the political level into &quot;Revolutionary Music&quot; leaning toward cult status and becoming mainstream under the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. Jiang Qing introduced the revolutionary model operas under her direct supervision; the eight Model Dramas (6 operas and 2 ballets) were promoted while traditional operas were banned. Notable examples are the operas &quot;The Legend of the Red Lantern&quot; and &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy&quot;, and the ballet pieces &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot; and &quot;The White Haired Girl&quot;. Other forms of musical composition and performance were greatly restricted. After the Cultural Revolution, musical institutions were reinstated and musical composition and performance revived.

Some of the more widely known political songs are &quot;Military Anthem of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot;, &quot;The East is Red&quot;, and the &quot;Internationale&quot;.
