<text>Geoffrey of Villehardouin (c. 1150 – c. 1213) was a French knight and historian who participated in and chronicled the Fourth Crusade. He is considered one of the most important historians of the time period, best known for writing the eyewitness account &quot;De la Conquête de Constantinople&quot; (&quot;On the Conquest of Constantinople&quot;), about the battle for Constantinople between the Christians of the West and the Christians of the East on 13 April 1204. The &quot;Conquest&quot; is the earliest French historical prose narrative that has survived to modern times. Ηis full title was: &quot;Geoffroi of Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne and of Romania&quot;.

==Biography==

A layman and a soldier, Geoffroi was appointed Marshal of Champagne from 1185 and joined the Crusade in 1199 during a tournament held by Count Thibaud III of Champagne. Thibaud named him one of the ambassadors to Venice to procure ships for the voyage, and he helped to elect Boniface of Montferrat as the new leader of the Crusade when Thibaud died.

Although Geoffroi does not say so specifically in his own account, he probably supported the diversion of the Crusade first to Zara and then to Constantinople. While at Constantinople he also served as an ambassador to Isaac II Angelus, and was in the embassy that demanded that Isaac appoint Alexius IV co-emperor.

After the conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 he served as a military leader, and led the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 after Baldwin I was captured by the forces of the Second Bulgarian Empire. In recognition of his services, Boniface of Montferrat gave to Geoffroi the city of Messinopolis in Thrace. After the Crusade, he was named Marshal of the Latin Empire.

In 1207, Geoffroi began to write his chronicle of the Crusade, &quot;On the Conquest of Constantinople&quot;. It was in French rather than Latin, making it one of the earliest works of French prose. Villehardouin&#x27;s account is generally read alongside that of Robert of Clari, a French knight of low station, Niketas Choniates, a high-ranking Byzantine official and historian who gives an eyewitness account, and Gunther of Pairis, a Cistercian monk who tells the story from the perspective of Abbot Martin who accompanied the Crusaders.

Villehardouin&#x27;s nephew Geoffroi I of Villehardouin went on to become Prince of Achaea in Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnesus) in 1209. Villehardouin himself seems to have died shortly afterwards. His son Erard had taken the title of &quot;seigneur de Villehardouin&quot; in 1213. There is evidence of his children raising memorials for him in 1218, suggesting he died around this time.

<doc id="254127" wikidata="Q258652" url="?curid=254127" title="Double bond">
<text>In chemistry, a double bond is a covalent bond between two atoms involving four bonding electrons as opposed to two in a single bond. Double bonds occur most commonly between two carbon atoms, for example in alkenes. Many double bonds exist between two different elements: for example, in a carbonyl group between a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N), and sulfoxides (S=O). In a skeletal formula, a double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected atoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for this. Double bonds were introduced in chemical notation by Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov.

Double bonds involving carbon are stronger and shorter than single bonds. The bond order is two. Double bonds are also electron-rich, which makes them potentially more reactive in the presence of a strong electron acceptor (as in addition reactions of the halogens).

==Double bonds in alkenes==

The type of bonding can be explained in terms of orbital hybridisation. In ethylene each carbon atom has three sp2 orbitals and one p-orbital. The three sp2 orbitals lie in a plane with ~120° angles. The p-orbital is perpendicular to this plane. When the carbon atoms approach each other, two of the sp2 orbitals overlap to form a sigma bond. At the same time, the two p-orbitals approach (again in the same plane) and together they form a pi bond. For maximum overlap, the p-orbitals have to remain parallel, and, therefore, rotation around the central bond is not possible. This property gives rise to cis-trans isomerism. Double bonds are shorter than single bonds because p-orbital overlap is maximized.

With 133 pm, the ethylene C=C bond length is shorter than the C−C length in ethane with 154 pm. The double bond is also stronger, 636 kJ mol−1 versus 368 kJ mol−1 but not twice as much as the pi-bond is weaker than the sigma bond due to less effective pi-overlap.

In an alternative representation, the double bond results from two overlapping sp3 orbitals as in a bent bond.

==Variations==
In molecules with alternating double bonds and single bonds, p-orbital overlap can exist over multiple atoms in a chain, giving rise to a conjugated system. Conjugation can be found in systems such as dienes and enones. In cyclic molecules, conjugation can lead to aromaticity. In cumulenes, two double bonds are adjacent.

Double bonds are common for period 2 elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and less common with elements of higher periods. Metals, too, can engage in multiple bonding in a metal ligand multiple bond.

==Group 14 alkene homologs ==
Double bonded compounds, alkene homologs, R2E=ER2 are now known for all of the heavier group 14 elements. Unlike the alkenes these compounds are not planar but adopt twisted and/or trans bent structures. These effects become more pronounced for the heavier elements. The distannene (Me3Si)2CHSn=SnCH(SiMe3)2 has a tin-tin bond length just a little shorter than a single bond, a trans bent structure with pyramidal coordination at each tin atom, and readily dissociates in solution to form (Me3Si)2CHSn: (stannanediyl, a carbene analog). The bonding comprises two weak donor acceptor bonds, the lone pair on each tin atom overlapping with the empty p orbital on the other. In contrast, in disilenes each silicon atom has planar coordination but the substituents are twisted so that the molecule as a whole is not planar. In diplumbenes the Pb=Pb bond length can be longer than that of many corresponding single bonds Plumbenes and stannenes generally dissociate in solution into monomers with bond enthalpies that are just a fraction of the corresponding single bonds. Some double bonds plumbenes and stannenes are similar in strength to hydrogen bonds. The Carter-Goddard-Malrieu-Trinquier model can be used to predict the nature of the bonding.

<doc id="254128" wikidata="Q4120025" url="?curid=254128" title="Jet airliner">
<text>A jet airliner or jetliner is an airliner powered by jet engines (passenger jet aircraft). Airliners usually have two or four jet engines; three-engined designs were popular in the 1970s but are less common today. Airliners are commonly classified as either the large wide-body aircraft, medium narrow-body aircraft and smaller regional jet.

Most airliners today are powered by jet engines, because they are capable of safely operating at high speeds and generate sufficient thrust to power large-capacity aircraft. The first jetliners, introduced in the 1950s, used the simpler turbojet engine; these were quickly supplanted by designs using turbofans, which are quieter and more fuel-efficient.

==History==

===Early history===
The first airliners with turbojet propulsion were experimental conversions of the Avro Lancastrian piston-engined airliner, which were flown with several types of early jet engine, including the de Havilland Ghost and the Rolls-Royce Nene. They retained the two inboard piston engines, the jets being housed in the outboard nacelles. The first airliner with jet power only was the Nene-powered Vickers VC.1 Viking &quot;G-AJPH&quot;, which first flew on 6 April 1948.

The early jet airliners had much lower interior levels of noise and vibration than contemporary piston-engined aircraft, so much so that in 1947, after piloting a jet powered aircraft for the first time, Wing Commander Maurice A. Smith, editor of &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, said, &quot;Piloting a jet aircraft has confirmed one opinion I had formed after flying as a passenger in the Lancastrian jet test beds, that few, if any, having flown in a jet-propelled transport, will wish to revert to the noise, vibration and attendant fatigue of an airscrew-propelled piston-engined aircraft&quot;

===1950s===

The first purpose-built jet airliner was the British de Havilland Comet which first flew in 1949 and entered service in 1952 with BOAC. It carried 36 passengers up to 2500 miles (4000 km) at a speed of 450mph (725 km/h). Serious structural problems arose not even two years after entering service and prompted several changes in design. The last original Comet was retrofitted in 1958. Also developed in 1949 was the Avro Canada C102 Jetliner, which never reached production; however, the term &quot;jetliner&quot; came into use as a generic term for passenger jet aircraft.

These first jet airliners were followed some years later by the Sud Aviation Caravelle from France, the Tupolev Tu-104 from the Soviet Union (2nd in service), and the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8 and Convair 880 from the United States. National prestige was attached to developing prototypes and bringing these early designs into service. There was also a strong nationalism in purchasing policy, so that US Boeing and Douglas aircraft became closely associated with Pan Am, while BOAC ordered British Comets.

Pan Am and BOAC, with the help of advertising agencies and their strong nautical traditions of command hierarchy and chain of command (retained from their days of operating flying boats), were quick to link the &quot;speed of jets&quot; with the safety and security of the &quot;luxury of ocean liners&quot; in the public&#x27;s perception.

Aeroflot used Soviet Tupolevs, while Air France introduced French Caravelles. Commercial realities dictated exceptions, however, as few airlines could risk missing out on a superior product: American Airlines ordered the pioneering Comet (but later cancelled when the Comet ran into metal fatigue problems), Canadian, British and European airlines could not ignore the better operating economics of the Boeing 707 and the DC-8, while some American airlines ordered the Caravelle.

Boeing became the most successful of the early manufacturers. The KC-135 Stratotanker and military versions of the 707 remain operational, mostly as tankers or freighters. The basic configuration of the Boeing, Convair and Douglas aircraft jet airliner designs, with widely spaced podded engines underslung on pylons beneath a swept wing, proved to be the most common arrangement and was most easily compatible with the large-diameter high-bypass turbofan engines that subsequently prevailed for reasons of quietness and fuel efficiency.

====Innovations====
The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3 turbojets powered the original Boeing 707 and DC-8 models; in the early 1960s the JT3 was modified into the JT3D low-bypass turbofan for long-range 707 and DC-8 variants.

The de Havilland and Tupolev designs had engines incorporated within the wings next to the fuselage, a concept that endured only within military designs while the Caravelle pioneered engines mounted either side of the rear fuselage.

===1960s===
The 1960s jet airliners include the BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9 twinjets; Boeing 727, Hawker Siddeley Trident and Tupolev Tu-154 trijets; and the paired multi-engined Ilyushin Il-62, and Vickers VC10. The world-renowned supersonic Concorde first flew in 1969 but proved to be an economical disaster. Only 14 ever entered service, and the last Concorde was retired in 2003.

====Innovations====
The 1960s jet airliners were known for the advancement of the more economical turbofan technology, which passes air around the engine core instead of through it. Jet airliners that entered service in the 1960s were powered by slim, low-bypass turbofan engines, many aircraft used the rear-engined, T-tail configuration, such as the BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 737, and Douglas DC-9 twinjets; Boeing 727, Hawker Siddeley Trident, Tupolev Tu-154 trijets; and the paired multi-engined Ilyushin Il-62, and Vickers VC10. The rear-engined T-tail arrangement is still used for jetliners with a maximum takeoff weight of less than 50 tons.

As of April 2023, 15,591 Boeing 737s have been ordered and 11,395 delivered, and it remains the most produced jet aircraft.

Other 1960s developments, such as rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO), water-injection, and afterburners (also known as reheat) used on supersonic jetliners (SSTs) such as Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144, have been superseded.

===1970s===
The 1970s jet airliners introduced wide-body (twin-aisle) craft and high-bypass turbofan engines. Pan Am and Boeing &quot;again opened a new era in commercial aviation&quot; when the first Boeing 747 entered service in January 1970, marking the debut of the high-bypass turbofan which lowered operating costs, and the initial models which could seat up to 400 passengers earned it the nickname &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot;. The Boeing 747 revolutionized air travel by making commercial air travel more affordable as ticket prices fell and airlines improved their pricing practices. Other wide-body designs included the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets, smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. There was also the market debut of the European consortium Airbus, whose first aircraft was the twinjet Airbus A300.

===1980s===

In 1978, Boeing unveiled the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, and the wide body twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours&#x27; distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners.

===1990s===
By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas started working on the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10. Airbus, thanks to the success of its A320 family, developed the medium-range A330 twinjet and the related long-range A340 quad-jet. In 1988, Boeing began developing what would be the 777 twinjet, using the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. In addition, Boeing also released a major update on their 747, the 747-400.

==Present day==
The most modern airliners are characterized by increased use of composite materials, high-bypass ratio turbofan engines, and more advanced digital flight systems. Examples of the latest widebody airliners are the Airbus A380 (first flight in 2005), Boeing 787 (first flight in 2009) and Airbus A350 (first flight in 2013). These improvements allowed longer ranges and lower cost of transportation per passenger. Sukhoi Superjet 100 and Airbus A220 (formerly Bombardier CSeries) are examples of narrowbodies with similar level of technological advancements.

The A380 was discontinued in 2019 and the last plane was delivered to Emirates in 2021. Airbus began designing it in the 90s with the expectation that airlines would be moving many people between large hubs with just one flight. Their focus was on building a very large plane with a conventional metal airframe and engines to supersede the Boeing 747. However, airlines started to operate more direct, point-to-point flights between smaller cities which made twin engine jets more attractive and economical to operate. For comparison, Boeing took a different approach and started development of the 787 in 2003 with a new composite frame and more fuel-efficient engines. This would prove to be the smarter choice as the lighter airframe paired with two next generation engines (Trent 1000 and GEnx) was much less costly to operate then the quad engine A380. The final blow to the A380 program came when Emirates cancelled a major order in 2018 and left Airbus without enough demand to continue production. It cancelled the program after realizing it would never recoup the €25 billon ($30 billion) spent on research and development. In all, 251 A380s were produced for and flown by 14 airlines. As of June 2023, Boeing has produced 1,054 787s for 34 airlines and has 592 unfulfilled orders.

<text>OSF/1 is a variant of the Unix operating system developed by the Open Software Foundation during the late 1980s and early 1990s. OSF/1 is one of the first operating systems to have used the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University, and is probably best known as the native Unix operating system for DEC Alpha architecture systems.

In 1994, after AT&amp;T had sold UNIX System V to Novell and the rival Unix International consortium had disbanded, the Open Software Foundation ceased funding of research and development of OSF/1. The Tru64 UNIX variant of OSF/1 was supported by HP until 2012.

== Background ==
In 1988, during the so-called &quot;Unix wars&quot;, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) joined with IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and others to form the Open Software Foundation (OSF) to develop a version of Unix named OSF/1. The aim was to compete with System V Release 4 from AT&amp;T Corporation and Sun Microsystems, and it has been argued that a primary goal was for the operating system to be free of AT&amp;T intellectual property. The fact that OSF/1 is one of the first operating systems to have used the Mach kernel is cited as support of this assertion. Digital also strongly promoted OSF/1 for real-time applications, and with traditional UNIX implementations at the time providing poor real-time support at best, the real-time and multi-threading support can be interpreted as having been heavily dependent on the Mach kernel. At the time of its introduction, OSF/1 became the third major flavor of UNIX together with System V and BSD.

OSF/1 at its inception combined Mach 2.5 with a large part of the BSD kernel (based on the 4.3-Reno release) to implement the UNIX API, with this monolithic kernel arrangement continuing through the OSF/1 1.2 release, although the adoption of a microkernel had already been foreseen. OSF/1 1.3 introduced such a microkernel in the form of Mach 3.0, hosting Unix system services separately in user space to provide the existing OSF/1 functionality.

== Vendor releases ==
DEC&#x27;s first release of OSF/1 (OSF/1 Release 1.0) in January 1992 was for its line of MIPS-based DECstation workstations, however this was never a fully supported product. DEC ported OSF/1 to their new Alpha AXP platform as DEC OSF/1 AXP Release 1.2, released in March 1993. OSF/1 AXP is a full 64-bit operating system, preserving the kernel architecture based on Mach 2.5 and 4.3BSD components. From OSF/1 AXP 2.0 onwards, UNIX System V compatibility was also integrated into the system, but the architecture remained centred on the Mach 2.5 modular kernel, unlike later OSF versions of the system. Although OSF/1 2.0 was also developed for DECStation MIPS systems, it was &quot;never officially released or sold&quot;. Subsequent releases are named Digital UNIX, and later, Tru64 UNIX.

Upon its acquisition of Apollo Computer in 1989, HP announced plans to introduce OSF/1 on both companies&#x27; products by late 1990. HP released a port of OSF/1 to the early HP 9000/700 workstations based on the PA-RISC 1.1 architecture. This was withdrawn soon afterwards due to lack of software and hardware support compared to competing operating systems, specifically HP-UX.

As part of the AIM alliance and the resulting PowerOpen specification, Apple Computer intended to base A/UX 4.0 for its PowerPC-based Macintoshes upon OSF/1, but the project was cancelled and PowerOpen deprecated.

IBM used OSF/1 as the basis of the AIX/ESA operating system for System/370 and System/390 mainframes.

Intel Paragon supercomputers used a version of OSF/1 featuring the Mach 3.0 kernel.

OSF/1 was also ported by Kendall Square Research to its proprietary microarchitecture used in the KSR1 supercomputer.

== OSF MK ==
The Open Software Foundation created OSF MK, an evolution of OSF/1, incorporating the OSF Mach kernel (or OSF Microkernel) based on Mach 3.0 along with a variety of other functionality including the OSF/1 Single Server providing the Unix system personality. The complete system in the form of MK 5.0 was made available under commercial terms to OSF/1 licensees in April 1993. In contrast to the OSF/1 server, which was encumbered by proprietary Unix licensing, the microkernel itself remained freely available for adoption by other projects. In OSF MK, it contains applicable code from the University of Utah Mach 4 kernel (such as the &quot;Shuttles&quot; modification used to speed up message passing) and applicable code from the many Mach 3.0 variants that sprouted off from the original Carnegie Mellon University Mach 3.0 kernel. It also consists of improvements made by the OSF such as built-in collocation capability, realtime improvements, and rewriting of the IPC RPC component for better performance.

== OSF/1 AD ==
OSF/1 AD (&quot;Advanced Development&quot;) was a distributed version of OSF/1 developed for massively parallel supercomputers by Locus Computing Corporation. Variants of OSF/1 AD are on several such systems, including the Intel Paragon XP/S and ASCI Red, Convex Exemplar SPP-1200 (as &quot;SPP-UX&quot;) and the Hitachi SR2201 (as &quot;HI-UX MPP&quot;).

== OSF/2 ==

OSF/2, a successor to OSF/1, was described as being based on the TMach system developed by Trusted Information Systems. TMach, or Trusted Mach, was an operating system architecture incorporating the OSF Mach MK++ kernel, introducing a trusted computing base layer consisting of trusted server components, hosting an application layer in which untrusted programs would run. In 1989, HP announced plans to merge the software platforms of its own products and those of newly acquired Apollo Computer to form a single OSF/2-compliant platform to be delivered by 1992.

Other interpretations of the OSF/2 name were associated with various plans to remove AT&amp;T-licensed code from early forms of OSF/1 and the Mach kernel in particular, leading to speculation that a system based on the Chorus microkernel might supplant Mach entirely and become OSF/2 itself. With such a Chorus-based architecture having been rejected in favour of the Mach 3.0 microkernel, the OSF/2 designation persisted in reporting of this particular form of OSF/1.

<doc id="254131" wikidata="Q427048" url="?curid=254131" title="Coat of arms of Quebec">
<text>The coat of arms of Quebec () was adopted by order-in-council of the Government of Quebec on 9 December 1939, replacing the arms assigned by royal warrant of Queen Victoria on 26 May 1868.

== Symbolism ==
The shield is divided into three horizontal fields:
* &quot;Top&quot; – three gold fleurs-de-lis on a blue background, symbolizing royal France;
* &quot;Middle&quot; – a gold lion passant guardant on a red background, symbolizing the Kingdom of England;
* &quot;Bottom&quot; – three green maple leaves on a gold background, symbolizing Canada.

The shield is surmounted by the Tudor Crown and accompanied by a silver scroll bearing the province&#x27;s motto, .

==Blazon==
The blazon is:

:Tierced (divided in three parts, horizontally) in fess, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or, Gules a lion passant guardant, and Or a sprig of three maple leaves Vert; Motto: JE ME SOUVIENS.

==History==

Arms were first granted to the province in 1868 by Queen Victoria. They were blazoned as follows:

:&quot;Or on a Fess Gules between two Fleurs de Lis in chief Azure, and a sprig of three Leaves of Maple slipped Vert in base, a Lion passant guardant Or.&quot;

However, in 1939, the Quebec government adopted arms by order-in-council, replacing the two blue fleurs-de-lis on the golden field with the royal arms of France Modern in chief. Quebec is the only Canadian province to have adopted arms by its own authority.

The federal government is inconsistent in the use of the two variants: it often uses the 1939 variant, but in some cases, such as on the Centennial Flame on Parliament Hill and the badge of the Royal 22e Régiment, it uses the 1868 variant.

<text>OS/8 is the primary operating system used on the Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-8 minicomputer. 

PDP-8 operating systems which precede OS/8 include:
* R-L Monitor, also referred to as MS/8.
* P?S/8, requiring only 4K of memory.
* PDP-8 4K Disk Monitor System
* PS/8 (&quot;Programming System/8&quot;), requiring 8K. This is what became OS/8 in 1971.

Other/related DEC operating systems are OS/78, OS/278, and OS/12. The latter is a virtually identical version of OS/8, and runs on Digital&#x27;s PDP-12 computer.

Digital released OS/8 images for non-commercial purposes which can be emulated through SIMH.

==Overview==
OS/8 provides a simple operating environment that is commensurate in complexity and scale with the PDP-8 computers on which it ran. I/O is supported via a series of supplied drivers which uses polled (not interrupt-driven) techniques. The device drivers have to be cleverly written as they can occupy only one or two memory pages of 128 12-bit words, and have to be able to run in any page in field 0. This often requires considerable cleverness, such as the use of the OPR instruction (7XXX) for small negative constants. 

The memory-resident &quot;footprint&quot; of OS/8 is only 256 words; 128 words at the top of Field 0 and 128 words at the top of Field 1. The rest of the operating system (the USR, &quot;User Service Routines&quot;) swaps in and out of memory transparently (with regard to the user&#x27;s program) as needed. This disk-resident (or more properly, system-device-resident) part of OS/8 is the first 14K words (56 blocks) of the SYS: device, including swap space.

The remaining memory contents are preserved between some of the basic user commands. This is exploited by the process by which executable programs are built: for example, an assembly language program is first assembled into a .BN (binary) file. Then one or more .BN files are loaded into memory using the LOAD (ABSLDR) command. You could then execute the loaded program with the START command, debug it with ODT, or SAVE it to a .SV file which can be later retrieved with the GET command or executed immediately with R or RUN commands. Information about the currently loaded program is maintained in the CCB (Core Control Block), which is located on the SYS: device. This information includes which parts of memory are used by the program (which parts should be saved) and the program&#x27;s starting address.

This concept of preserved memory being associated with a user or job also appears in other DEC operating systems, including TOPS-10 for the PDP-10, where such memory is known as a context.

OS/8 can boot from a hard disk and present the command prompt in under half a second.

==The Concise Command Language==
Early versions of OS/8 have a very rudimentary command-line interpreter with very few basic commands: , , , , , and . With version 3 they add a more sophisticated overlay called &quot;CCL&quot; (&quot;Concise Command Language&quot;) that implements many more commands. OS/8&#x27;s CCL is directly patterned after the CCL found on Digital&#x27;s PDP-10 systems running TOPS-10. In fact, much of the OS/8 software system is deliberately designed to mimic, as closely as possible, the TOPS-10 operating environment. (The CCL command language is used on PDP-11 computers running RT-11, RSX-11, and RSTS/E, providing a similar user operating environment across all three architectures: PDP-8s, PDP-10s, and PDP-11s.)

The basic OS and CCL implements many rather sophisticated commands, many of which still do not exist in modern command languages, not even in MS-DOS, Windows, or Unix-like operating systems.

For example, the command automatically finds the right compiler for a given source file and starts the compile/assemble/link cycle.

The and commands permit the use of logical device names in a program instead of physical names (as required in MS-DOS). For example, a program can write to device , and with an initial &quot;&quot; then the file is created on physical device RXA2 (the second floppy disk drive). VAX/VMS and the Amiga&#x27;s operating system AmigaOS (and other OSes built around TRIPOS) make considerable use of this feature.

The command is capable of setting many system options by patching locations in the system binary code. One of them, a command under OS-78, is , which re-enables the MONITOR commands that are not part of OS-78.

The command can reconfigure the OS on the fly, even adding device drivers, often without having to reboot the OS.

==The OS/8 Filesystem==
OS/8 supports a simple, flat file system on a variety of mass storage devices including:
* TU56 DECtapes
* DF32 32KW fixed-head disks
* RF08 256KW fixed-head disks
* RK01/02/03/04/05 cartridge disk drives
* RL01/02 cartridge disk drives
* RX01/02 floppy diskette drives

Filenames on the PDP-8 take the form of where &quot;F&quot; represents an uppercase, alphanumeric character of the filename and &quot;X&quot; represents an uppercase, alphanumeric character of the extension (filetype).
* .PA : Assembly language 
* .SV : saved core-images (executable programs)
* .FT : Fortran source files
* .DA : Data files

The contents of any given file is stored contiguously in a single &quot;extent&quot;. Allocation works as follows: a program first opens a tentative file (using the User Service Router (USR) &quot;ENTER&quot; function). This assigns either the largest free extent to the file, or if the desired file size is known in advance, the smallest extent that it fits in. ENTER returns the starting block number and size of the file to the program which then writes to the file by directly calling the device driver. Once writing is complete, the program calls the USR &quot;CLOSE&quot; function. CLOSE marks the tentative file as a permanent file and creates an extent for the remaining free space for future allocations. It also deletes (marks as available free space) any other file with the same name. This facilitates replacing an existing file with a new version, for example after editing (&quot;CLOSE&quot; doubles as the file deletion call). Only one tentative file per volume may be open at a time. This seems limiting, but works for something like the PAL8 assembler since only one output file is generated at a time for each pass.

PIP includes an option to compress (&quot;squeeze&quot;) the filesystem, so that all unallocated space is moved to a single extent at the end of the disk. This can be invoked by the &quot;SQuish&quot; CCL command, much as &quot;MUNG&quot; can be used to run a &quot;TECO&quot; macro.

OS/8 volumes have a limited maximum storage size (4096 blocks of 256 twelve-bit words) and the RK05 (2.4MB) moving-head disk exceeds this size: &quot;1.6 million words of storage&quot;. Because of this, RK05 cartridges are divided into two partitions. For example, the first RK05 on a system is known as both RKA0: (SY:) and RKB0:. This division refers to &quot;the outer cylinders&quot; and &quot;the inner cylinders&quot;.

===ASCII===
There are two systems for handling ASCII text. ASCII files are stored as three 8-bit characters per pair of 12-bit words. The first two characters (marked with bits a0–a7 and b0–b7 below) are stored whole in their words, while the third character (bits c0–c7) is stored with half of its bits in word 1 and the other half in word 2.
* WORD 1: c0 c1 c2 c3 | a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7
* WORD 2: c4 c5 c6 c7 | b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7&lt;br&gt;ASCII files end with a CTRL/Z (ASCII 232).

6-bits per character uppercase only ASCII strings are also used. In this case, two characters efficiently fit in each word. This is used for filenames in directory entries, but also for strings in BASIC. In BASIC, even though strings use 6-bit characters, you may print any 8-bit code by using the PNT() function within PRINT, for example use PNT(27) to print an ASCII ESC character.

===OS/8 date format===
OS/8 allocates the PDP-8&#x27;s 12 bit words for storing dates per:
* 4 bits for the month
* 5 bits for the date therein
* 3 bits for the year.

The insufficiency of a three-bit year field, capable of storing only eight years, was recognized when COS-310 was developed.

==OS/8 CUSPs (Utility Programs)==
The CUSPs (Commonly-Used System Programs, that is utilities) supplied with OS/8 include:
* BUILD (the program to install a configured OS/8 system onto mass storage)
* DIR (the directory-listing program)
* EDIT (A line-oriented editor)
* MACREL (A relocating assembler that, unlike PAL, implements macros. Written by Stanley Rabinowitz of DEC&#x27;s Small Systems Group. Stan had an ASCII-artwork picture of a fish in his office that said &quot;MACREL IS A FISH&quot;)
* FLAP (An absolute assembler derived from RALF)
* FORTRAN-II.
* FOTP (File-Oriented Transfer Program, an alternative to PIP)
* PAL (The assembler)
* PIP (the Peripheral Interchange Program, used to copy files)
* PIP10 (a version of PIP used to copy files to from PDP-10 DECtapes)
* RALF (Another relocating assembler for the FPP)
* TECO (Text Editor and COrrector, a sophisticated editor). The MUNG command runs TECO macros.
* CCL, the command line interpreter, supplied in source form and user-extensible.

==Programming languages==
===BASIC===
A single-user BASIC and two multi-user versions of BASIC are available as options.

The single-user BASIC uses several overlays to provide the full functionality of the language; when OS/8 is booted from a DECtape, a noticeable delay occurred each time BASIC is required to switch overlays as they need to be read from tape.

The multi-user versions of BASIC (EDU20 and EDU25) differ only in whether or not they support block-replaceable devices (DECtape or disk). Due to cost constraints, many PDP-8s have punched paper tape readers as their only mass-storage I/O device. EDU20 loads from paper tape and can do output to a paper tape writer if the machine has one, whereas EDU25 understands the structure of a filesystem, can load from DECtape or disk, and can create files on DECtape or disk. Both can run multiple BASIC programs simultaneously using a primitive task-scheduler that round-robins among the attached terminals. Memory is always tight because the PDP-8 uses core memory, which was extremely expensive compared to RAM technology. In 8K of 12-bit words EDU20 can support up to 4 terminals at once, although more memory was recommended. EDU25 requires an additional 4K memory bank (for a minimum of 12K) because the code contains a disk device driver and a filesystem handler. While running, EDU20 and EDU25 are self-contained programs that don&#x27;t use any OS/8 system calls. Immediately upon being invoked from the OS/8 command interpreter, they overwrite OS/8&#x27;s entire resident portion – all 256 words of it. Upon startup, EDU25 saves the contents of memory to DECtape or disk and restores it upon exit. But EDU20 cannot do this as it is targeted at hardware configurations without any block-replaceable device.

===FORTRAN===
In addition to a freely available FORTRAN II compiler, there is also a rather complete FORTRAN IV compiler available. This compiler generates code for the optional FPP-8 floating-point processor, which is essentially a separate CPU, only sharing memory with the PDP-8 CPU. With the FPP-8 option installed, the FORTRAN runtime code detects it and uses the FPP-8 to run the main program code, and the PDP-8 CPU runs as an I/O processor. Lacking the FPP-8, the runtime code instead calls an FPP-8 interpreter running on the PDP-8 CPU, so the program runs at reduced speed.

This FORTRAN IV compiler in version 1 has the interesting bug that DO loops counted incorrectly: DO loops would count 1,2,3,5,6,7,… (skipping 4). A quick patch was released to fix this.

<text>Louis Spohr (, 5 April 178422 October 1859), baptized Ludewig Spohr, later often in the modern German form of the name Ludwig was a German composer, violinist and conductor.

Highly regarded during his lifetime, Spohr composed ten symphonies, ten operas, eighteen violin concerti, four clarinet concerti, four oratorios, and various works for small ensemble, chamber music, and art songs. Spohr invented the violin chinrest and the orchestral rehearsal mark. His output spans the transition between Classical and Romantic music, but fell into obscurity following his death, when his music was rarely heard. The late twentieth century saw a modest revival of interest in his oeuvre primarily in Europe, but his reputation has never been restored to that of his lifetime.

==Life==
Spohr was born in Braunschweig in the duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel to Karl Heinrich Spohr and Juliane Ernestine Luise Henke on 5 April 1784; then in 1786 the family moved to Seesen. Spohr&#x27;s first musical encouragement came from his parents: his mother was a gifted singer and pianist, and his father played the flute. A violinist named Dufour gave him his earliest violin teaching. The pupil&#x27;s first attempts at composition date from the early 1790s. Dufour, recognizing the boy&#x27;s musical talent, persuaded his parents to send him to Brunswick for further instruction.
The failure of his first concert tour, a badly planned venture to Hamburg in 1799, caused him to ask Duke Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick for financial help. A successful concert at the court impressed the duke so much that he engaged the 15-year-old Spohr as a chamber musician. In 1802, through the good offices of the duke, he became the pupil of Franz Eck and accompanied him on a concert tour which took him as far as Saint Petersburg. Eck, who completely retrained Spohr in violin technique, was a product of the Mannheim school, and Spohr became its most prominent heir. Spohr&#x27;s first notable compositions, including his Violin Concerto No. 1, date from this time. After his return home, the duke granted him leave to make a concert tour of North Germany. A concert in Leipzig in December 1804 brought the influential music critic Friedrich Rochlitz &quot;to his knees,&quot; not only because of Spohr&#x27;s playing but also because of his compositions. This concert brought the young man overnight fame in the whole German-speaking world.

In 1805, Spohr obtained a position as concertmaster at the court of Gotha, where he stayed until 1812. There he met the 18-year-old harpist and pianist Dorette Scheidler, daughter of one of the court singers. They were married on 2 February 1806, and lived happily until Dorette&#x27;s death 28 years later. They performed successfully together as a violin and harp duo (Spohr having composed the Sonata in C minor for violin and harp for her), touring in Italy (1816–1817), England (1820) and Paris (1821), but Dorette later abandoned her harpist&#x27;s career and concentrated on raising their children.

In 1808, Spohr practiced with Beethoven at the latter&#x27;s home, working on the Piano Trio, Op. 70 No. 1, &quot;The Ghost&quot;. Spohr wrote that the piano was out of tune and that Beethoven&#x27;s playing was harsh or careless. In 1812, Spohr conducted a concert in the of the French-occupied Principality of Erfurt to celebrate Napoleon&#x27;s 43rd birthday. Spohr later worked as conductor at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna (1813–1815), where he continued to be on friendly terms with Beethoven; subsequently he was opera director at Frankfurt (1817–1819) where he was able to stage his own operas — the first of which, &quot;Faust&quot;, had been rejected in Vienna. Spohr&#x27;s longest period of employment, from 1822 until his death, was as the director of music at the recently succeeded William II, Elector of Hesse&#x27;s court of Kassel, a position offered him on the suggestion of Carl Maria von Weber. In Kassel on 3 January 1836, he married his second wife, the 29-year-old Marianne Pfeiffer, daughter of the jurist Burkhard Wilhelm Pfeiffer. She survived him by many years, living until 1892.

In 1851 the elector refused to sign the permit for Spohr&#x27;s two months&#x27; leave of absence, to which he was entitled under his contract, and when the musician departed without the permit, a portion of his salary was deducted. In 1857 he was pensioned off, much against his own wish, and in the winter of the same year he broke his arm, an accident which put an end to his violin playing. Nevertheless, he conducted his opera &quot;Jessonda&quot; at the fiftieth anniversary of the Prague Conservatorium in the following year. In 1859 he died at Kassel on 22 October.

Like Haydn, Mozart, and his own slightly older contemporary Hummel, Spohr was an active Freemason. He was also active as a violin instructor and had about 200 pupils throughout his career – many of them becoming famous musicians. His notable pupils included violinists Henry Blagrove and Henry Holmes. 

==Works==

As a composer, Spohr produced more than 150 works with opus numbers, in addition to a number of nearly 140 works without such numbers. He wrote music in all genres. His nine symphonies (a tenth was completed, but withdrawn: Cf.) show a progress from the classical style of his predecessors to program music: his sixth symphony represents successive styles from &quot;Bach–Handel&quot; to the moderns; his seventh symphony represents the &#x27;sacred and secular in human life&#x27; with a double orchestra; and his ninth symphony represents &quot;Die Jahreszeiten&quot; (The Seasons). (The autograph score of the tenth symphony, which bears the complete work, is held by the Staatsbibliothek Berlin. Furthermore, the same institution holds a complete set of copied parts. Cf. also ). Between 1803 and 1844 Spohr wrote more violin concertos than any other composer of the time, eighteen in all, including works left unpublished at his death. Some of them are formally unconventional, such as the one-movement Concerto No. 8, which is in the style of an operatic aria, and which is still periodically revived (Jascha Heifetz championed it), most recently in a 2006 recording by Hilary Hahn. There are two double-violin concertos as well. Better known today, however, are the four clarinet concertos, all written for the virtuoso Johann Simon Hermstedt, which have established a secure place in clarinettists&#x27; repertoire.

Among Spohr&#x27;s chamber music is a series of no fewer than 36 string quartets, as well as four double quartets for two string quartets. He also wrote an assortment of other quartets, duos, trios, quintets and sextets, an octet and a nonet, works for solo violin and for solo harp, and works for violin and harp to be played by him and his wife together.

Though obscure today, Spohr&#x27;s operas &quot;Faust&quot; (1816), &quot;Zemire und Azor&quot; (1819) and &quot;Jessonda&quot; (1823) remained in the popular repertoire through the 19th century and well into the 20th, when &quot;Jessonda&quot; was banned by the Nazis because it depicted a European hero in love with an Indian princess. Spohr also wrote 105 songs and duets, many of them collected as &quot;Deutsche Lieder&quot; (German Songs), as well as a mass and other choral works. Most of his operas were little known outside of Germany, but his oratorios, particularly &quot;Die letzten Dinge&quot; (1825–1826) were greatly admired during the 19th century in England and America. This oratorio was translated by Edward Taylor (1784–1863) and performed as &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; in 1830 for the first time. During the Victorian era Gilbert and Sullivan mentioned him in act 2 of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in a song by the title character.

Spohr, with his eighteen violin concertos, won a conspicuous place in the musical literature of the nineteenth century. He endeavored (without any good result) to make the concerto a substantial and superior composition free from the artificial bravura of the time. He achieved a new romantic mode of expression. The weaker sides of Spohr&#x27;s violin compositions are observed in his somewhat monotonous rhythmic structures; in his rejection of certain piquant bowing styles, and artificial harmonics; and in the deficiency of contrapuntal textures.

Spohr was a noted violinist, and invented the violin chinrest, about 1820. He was also a significant conductor, being one of the first to use a baton and also inventing rehearsal letters, which are placed periodically throughout a piece of sheet music so that a conductor may save time by asking the orchestra or singers to start playing &quot;from letter C&quot;, for example.

In addition to musical works, Spohr is remembered particularly for his &quot;Violinschule&quot; (The Violin School), a treatise on violin playing which codified many of the latest advances in violin technique, such as the use of &quot;spiccato&quot;. It became a standard work of instruction. In addition, he wrote an entertaining and informative autobiography, published posthumously in 1860. A museum is devoted to his memory in Kassel.

According to Rey M. Longyear, Spohr&#x27;s best works were hailed by many of his contemporaries as quintessentially Romantic and inherited by Mendelssohn.

<text>Isaac Kaufmann Funk (September 10, 1839April 4, 1912) was an American Lutheran minister, editor, lexicographer, publisher, and spelling reformer. He was the co-founder of Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, the father of author Wilfred J. Funk (who founded his own publishing company, Wilfred Funk, Inc., and wrote the &quot;Word Power&quot; feature in Reader&#x27;s Digest from 1945 to 1962), and the grandfather of author Peter Funk, who continued his father&#x27;s authorship of &quot;Word Power&quot; until 2003. Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company published The Literary Digest, &quot;The Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, and &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia&quot;.

==Early life==
Funk was born in 1839 in the village of Clifton, Ohio. In 1842, he moved to Springfield, Ohio, where his father John managed the Pennsylvania House.

Years later, he attended Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University) and Wittenberg Theological Seminary, both in Springfield.

==Career==
Upon his graduation in 1860, he was ordained as a Lutheran pastor, and served pastorates in New York, Indiana, and his home state of Ohio; his last pastorate was at Saint Matthews English Lutheran Church in Brooklyn, New York, where he stayed seven years. In 1872, Funk resigned from the ministry and made an extensive tour through Europe, northern Africa, and Asia Minor.

Funk was a prohibitionist. He founded the &quot;Voice&quot; in 1880, an organ of the Prohibition Party, and he was the Prohibition candidate for mayor of New York. His Staten Island home, &quot;grand in scale and extremely decorative&quot;, was built in 1893 in what was then Prohibition Park, and the home still stands.

In 1875 he founded the publishing firm of I.K. Funk &amp; Company, with the help of a Wittenberg classmate, Adam Willis Wagnalls, a lawyer and accountant. That year he founded and published the &quot;Metropolitan Pulpit&quot; (later its name was changed to &quot;Homiletic Review&quot;). &quot;Missionary Review&quot; also numbered among the many religious publications he founded after 1876. In 1877 the name of his company was changed to Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, to reflect Wagnalls&#x27; partnership. In 1890 Funk published &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;, a departure from the religious works earlier in his career.

Perhaps Funk&#x27;s most important achievement was his &quot;Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, the first volume of which was published in 1893. He worked with a team of more than 740 people. His aim was to provide essential information thoroughly and simply at the same time. In order to achieve this he placed current meanings first, archaic meanings second, and etymologies last. The dictionary was said to have cost Funk &amp; Wagnalls over $960,000.

From 1901 until 1906, Funk &amp; Wagnalls compiled the &quot;Jewish Encyclopædia&quot;. After Funk died in 1912, the publishing house eventually became a subsidiary of Thomas Y. Crowell Co.

===Psychic research===
In his later years, Funk spent time on psychic research. Funk was a believer in spiritualism and in his book, &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Mite and Other Psychic Phenomena&quot;, published in 1904, he defended a number of mediums and spirit photography.

Magician Joseph Rinn has noted that Funk was easily duped by fraudulent mediums, such as the Bangs Sisters. Funk had bought several of their &#x27;spirit&#x27; pictures, unaware they were produced fraudulently. He also defended Anna Eva Fay and May S. Pepper, two mediums that were also exposed.

==Personal life==
Funk married Eliza Thompson of Carey, Ohio in 1864. After her death in 1868, Funk married her sister, Helen Gertrude Thompson (1842–1911). Funk had two sons and a daughter:

* James A. Funk (1876–1898), who predeceased his father in 1898 at age 21.
* Wilfred John Funk (1883–1965)
* Lida M. Funk, a Vassar College graduate who married Robert Scott in 1895.

Funk died in Montclair, New Jersey on April 4, 1912. After some bequests to his alma mater and his brother, the residue of the estate was left to his two surviving children.

<doc id="254138" wikidata="Q864032" url="?curid=254138" title="Binomial heap">
<text>In computer science, a binomial heap is a data structure that acts as a priority queue. It is an example of a mergeable heap (also called meldable heap), as it supports merging two heaps in logarithmic time. It is implemented as a heap similar to a binary heap but using a special tree structure that is different from the complete binary trees used by binary heaps. Binomial heaps were invented in 1978 by Jean Vuillemin.

== Binomial heap ==
A binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees (compare with a binary heap, which has a shape of a single binary tree), which are defined recursively as follows:
* A binomial tree of order 0 is a single node
* A binomial tree of order formula_1 has a root node whose children are roots of binomial trees of orders formula_2, formula_3, ..., 2, 1, 0 (in this order).

A binomial tree of order formula_1 has formula_5 nodes, and height formula_1.
The name comes from the shape: a binomial tree of order formula_1 has formula_8 nodes at depth formula_9, a binomial coefficient.
Because of its structure, a binomial tree of order formula_1 can be constructed from two trees of order formula_2 by attaching one of them as the leftmost child of the root of the other tree. This feature is central to the &quot;merge&quot; operation of a binomial heap, which is its major advantage over other conventional heaps.

== Structure of a binomial heap ==
A binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees that satisfy the &quot;binomial heap properties&quot;:
* Each binomial tree in a heap obeys the &quot;minimum-heap property&quot;: the key of a node is greater than or equal to the key of its parent.
* There can be at most one binomial tree for each order, including zero order.
The first property ensures that the root of each binomial tree contains the smallest key in the tree. It follows that the smallest key in the entire heap is one of the roots.

The second property implies that a binomial heap with formula_12 nodes consists of at most formula_13 binomial trees, where formula_14 is the binary logarithm. The number and orders of these trees are uniquely determined by the number of nodes formula_12: there is one binomial tree for each nonzero bit in the binary representation of the number formula_12. For example, the decimal number 13 is 1101 in binary, formula_17, and thus a binomial heap with 13 nodes will consist of three binomial trees of orders 3, 2, and 0 (see figure below).
The number of different ways that formula_12 items with distinct keys can be arranged into a binomial heap equals the largest odd divisor of formula_19. For formula_20 these numbers are
:1, 1, 3, 3, 15, 45, 315, 315, 2835, 14175, ... 
If the formula_12 items are inserted into a binomial heap in a uniformly random order, each of these arrangements is equally likely.

== Implementation ==
Because no operation requires random access to the root nodes of the binomial trees, the roots of the binomial trees can be stored in a linked list, ordered by increasing order of the tree. Because the number of children for each node is variable, it does not work well for each node to have separate links to each of its children, as would be common in a binary tree; instead, it is possible to implement this tree using links from each node to its highest-order child in the tree, and to its sibling of the next smaller order than it. These sibling pointers can be interpreted as the next pointers in a linked list of the children of each node, but with the opposite order from the linked list of roots: from largest to smallest order, rather than vice versa. This representation allows two trees of the same order to be linked together, making a tree of the next larger order, in constant time.

=== Merge ===
The operation of merging two heaps is used as a subroutine in most other operations.
A basic subroutine within this procedure merges pairs of binomial trees of the same order. This may be done by comparing the keys at the roots of the two trees (the smallest keys in both trees). The root node with the larger key is made into a child of the root node with the smaller key, increasing its order by one:

 function mergeTree(p, q)
 if p.root.key &lt;= q.root.key
 return p.addSubTree(q)
 else
 return q.addSubTree(p)

To merge two heaps more generally, the lists of roots of both heaps are traversed simultaneously in a manner similar to that of the merge algorithm,
in a sequence from smaller orders of trees to larger orders. When only one of the two heaps being merged contains a tree of order formula_22, this tree is moved to the output heap. When both of the two heaps contain a tree of order formula_22, the two trees are merged to one tree of order formula_24 so that the minimum-heap property is satisfied. It may later become necessary to merge this tree with some other tree of order formula_24 in one of the two input heaps. In the course of the algorithm, it will examine at most three trees of any order, two from the two heaps we merge and one composed of two smaller trees.

 function merge(p, q)
 while not (p.end() and q.end())
 tree = mergeTree(p.currentTree(), q.currentTree())

 if not heap.currentTree().empty()
 tree = mergeTree(tree, heap.currentTree())

 heap.addTree(tree)
 heap.next(); p.next(); q.next()

Because each binomial tree in a binomial heap corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of its size, there is an analogy between the merging of two heaps and the binary addition of the &quot;sizes&quot; of the two heaps, from right-to-left. Whenever a carry occurs during addition, this corresponds to a merging of two binomial trees during the merge.

Each binomial tree&#x27;s traversal during merge only involves roots, hence making the time taken at most order formula_26 and therefore the running time is formula_27.

=== Insert ===
Inserting a new element to a heap can be done by simply creating a new heap containing only this element and then merging it with the original heap. Because of the merge, a single insertion takes time formula_27. However, this can be sped up using a merge procedure that shortcuts the merge after it reaches a point where only one of the merged heaps has trees of larger order. With this speedup, across a series of formula_1 consecutive insertions, the total time for the insertions is formula_30. Another way of stating this is that (after logarithmic overhead for the first insertion in a sequence) each successive insert has an &quot;amortized&quot; time of formula_31 (i.e. constant) per insertion.

A variant of the binomial heap, the skew binomial heap, achieves constant worst case insertion time by using forests whose tree sizes are based on the skew binary number system rather than on the binary number system.

=== Find minimum ===
To find the minimum element of the heap, find the minimum among the roots of the binomial trees. This can be done in formula_27 time, as there are just formula_27 tree roots to examine.

By using a pointer to the binomial tree that contains the minimum element, the time for this operation can be reduced to formula_31. The pointer must be updated when performing any operation other than finding the minimum. This can be done in formula_27 time per update, without raising the overall asymptotic running time of any operation.

=== Delete minimum ===
To delete the minimum element from the heap, first find this element, remove it from the root of its binomial tree, and obtain a list of its child subtrees (which are each themselves binomial trees, of distinct orders). Transform this list of subtrees into a separate binomial heap by reordering them from smallest to largest order. Then merge this heap with the original heap. Since each root has at most formula_26 children, creating this new heap takes time formula_27. Merging heaps takes time formula_27, so the entire delete minimum operation takes time formula_27.

 function deleteMin(heap)
 min = heap.trees().first()
 for each current in heap.trees()
 if current.root &lt; min.root then min = current
 for each tree in min.subTrees()
 tmp.addTree(tree)
 heap.removeTree(min)
 merge(heap, tmp)

=== Decrease key ===
After decreasing the key of an element, it may become smaller than the key of its parent, violating the minimum-heap property. If this is the case, exchange the element with its parent, and possibly also with its grandparent, and so on, until the minimum-heap property is no longer violated. Each binomial tree has height at most formula_26, so this takes formula_27 time. However, this operation requires that the representation of the tree include pointers from each node to its parent in the tree, somewhat complicating the implementation of other operations.

=== Delete ===
To delete an element from the heap, decrease its key to negative infinity (or equivalently, to some value lower than any element in the heap) and then delete the minimum in the heap.

<text>The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) was the first general purpose time-sharing operating system. Compatible Time Sharing referred to time sharing which was compatible with batch processing; it could offer both time sharing and batch processing concurrently.

CTSS was developed at the MIT Computation Center (&quot;Comp Center&quot;). CTSS was first demonstrated on MIT&#x27;s modified IBM 709 in November 1961. The hardware was replaced with a modified IBM 7090 in 1962 and later a modified IBM 7094 called the &quot;blue machine&quot; to distinguish it from the Project MAC CTSS IBM 7094. Routine service to MIT Comp Center users began in the summer of 1963 and was operated there until 1968.

A second deployment of CTSS on a separate IBM 7094 that was received in October 1963 (the &quot;red machine&quot;) was used early on in Project MAC until 1969 when the red machine was moved to the Information Processing Center and operated until July 20, 1973. CTSS ran on only those two machines; however, there were remote CTSS users outside of MIT including ones in California, South America, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford.

==History==
John Backus said in the 1954 summer session at MIT that &quot;By time sharing, a big computer could be used as several small ones; there would need to be a reading station for each user&quot;. Computers at that time, like IBM 704, were not powerful enough to implement such system, but at the end of 1958, MIT&#x27;s Computation Center nevertheless added a typewriter input to its 704 with the intent that a programmer or operator could &quot;obtain additional answers from the machine on a time-sharing basis with other programs using the machine simultaneously&quot;.

In June 1959, Christopher Strachey published a paper &quot;Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers&quot; at the UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris, where he envisaged a programmer debugging a program at a console (like a teletype) connected to the computer, while another program was running in the computer at the same time. Debugging programs was an important problem at that time, because with batch processing, it then often took a day from submitting a changed code, to getting the results. John McCarthy wrote a memo about that at MIT, after which a preliminary study committee and a working committee were established at MIT, to develop time sharing. The committees envisaged many users using the computer at the same time, decided the details of implementing such system at MIT, and started the development of the system.

===Experimental Time Sharing System===
By July, 1961 a few time sharing commands had become operational on the Computation Center&#x27;s IBM 709, and in November 1961, Fernando J. Corbató demonstrated at MIT what was called the &quot;Experimental Time-Sharing System&quot;. On May 3, 1962, F. J. Corbató, M. M. Daggett and R. C. Daley published a paper about that system at the Spring Joint Computer Conference. &quot;[M]ajor portions of [the CTSS system were largely prepared by]: Mrs. Marjorie M. Daggett, Mr. Robert Daley, Mr. Robert Creasy, Mrs. Jessica Hellwig, Mr. Richard Orenstein, and Professor F. J. Corbató&quot;.

The system used an IBM 7090, modified by Herbert M. Teager, with added 3 Flexowriters for user consoles, and maybe a timer. Each of the 3 users had two tape units, one for the user&#x27;s file directory, and one for dumping the core (program in memory). There was also one tape unit for the system commands, there were no disk drives. The memory was 27 k words (36-bit words) for users, and 5 k words for the supervisor (operating system). The input from the consoles was written to the buffers in the supervisor, by interrupts, and when a return character was received, the control was given to the supervisor, which dumped the running code to the tape and decided what to run next. The console commands implemented at the time were &quot;login, logout, input, edit, fap, mad, madtrn, load, use, start, skippm, listf, printf, xdump&quot; and &quot;xundump&quot;.

This became the initial version of the Compatible Time-Sharing System. This was apparently the first ever public demonstration of time-sharing; there are other claims, but they refer to special-purpose systems, or with no known papers published. The &quot;compatibility&quot; of CTSS was with background jobs run on the same computer, which generally used more of the compute resources than the time-sharing functions.

==Applications==
===DOTSYS and BRAILLEMBOSS===
The first version of the DOTSYS braille translation software ran on CTSS and could output to a BRAILLEMBOSS braille page printer. DOTSYS on CTSS was first demonstrated on August 18, 1966, as part of a feasibility study where teletypesetter tape, in the form of news, was converted to Grade 2 Braille. The following month the feasibility of converting textbook information on teletypesetter tape to error-free Grade 2 Braille was successfully demonstrated. As MIT CTSS was an academic system, a research vehicle and not a system for commercial computing, two years later a version of DOTSYS stripped of CTSS dependencies for software portability was used on an IBM 709 at the American Printing House for the Blind to print the first braille edition of a book produced from teletypesetter input, only a few weeks after the ink-print version. The following year, on CTSS, a demonstration of printing mathematical tables in braille was shown. A short FORTRAN II program was written to produce a conversion table from inches to millimeters in braille via the BRAILLEMBOSS braille page printer.

===Intrex===

The Intrex Retrieval System ran on CTSS. Intrex was an experimental, pilot-model machine-oriented bibliographic storage and retrieval system with a database that stored a catalog of roughly 15,000 journal articles. It was used to develop and test concepts for library automation. A deployment of three BRISC CRT consoles for testing at the MIT Engineering Library showed that it was preferred over two other systems, ARDS and DATEL.

==Features==
* The original ELIZA ran on CTSS.
* CTSS was the first computer system to implement password login.
* CTSS had one of the first computerized text editing and formatting utilities, called TYPSET and RUNOFF (the successors of MEMO, MODIFY and DITTO).
* CTSS had one of the first inter-user messaging implementations, pioneering electronic mail.
* CTSS had one of the first instant messaging systems similar to write.
* MIT Computation Center staff member Louis Pouzin created for CTSS a command called RUNCOM, which executed a list of commands contained in a file. RUNCOM also provided for parameter substitution. He later created a design for the Multics shell that was implemented by Glenda Schroeder which in turn inspired Unix shell scripts.
* CTSS had an implementation of the text editor QED, the predecessor of ed, vi, and vim, with regular expressions added by Ken Thompson.

==Implementation==

===Kernel===
CTSS used a modified IBM 7090 mainframe computer that had two 32,768 (32K) 36-bit-word banks of core memory instead of the default configuration which provides only one. One bank was reserved for the time-sharing supervisory program, the other for user programs. CTSS had a protected-mode kernel; the supervisor&#x27;s functions in the A-core (memory bank A) could be called only by software interrupts, as in modern operating systems. Causing memory-protection interrupts were used for software interrupts. Processor allocation scheduling with a quantum time unit 200 ms, was controlled by a multilevel feedback queue. It also had some special memory-management hardware, a clock interrupt, and the ability to trap certain instructions.

===Supervisor subroutines===
* RDFLXA – Read an input line from console
* WRFLX – Write an output line to console
* DEAD – Put the user into dead status, with no program in memory
* DORMNT – Put the user into dormant status, with program in memory
* GETMEM – Get the size of the memory allocation
* SETMEM – Set the size of the memory allocation
* TSSFIL – Get access to the CTSS system files on the disk
* USRFIL – Change back to user&#x27;s own directory
* GETBRK – Get the instruction location counter at quit

===Programming languages===
CTSS at first had only an assembler, FAP, and a compiler, MAD. Also, Fortran II code could be translated into MAD code by using MADTRN. Later half of the system was written in MAD. Later there were other programming languages including COMIT II, LISP 1.5 and a version of ALGOL.

===File system===
Each user had their own directory, and there were also shared directories for groups of people with the same &quot;problem number&quot;. Each file had two names, the second indicating its type as did the extension in later system. At first, each file could have one of four modes: temporary, permanent, read-only class 1, and read-only class 2. Read-only class 1 allowed the user to change the mode of the file. Files could also be symbolically linked between directories. A directory listing by &quot;listf&quot;:
 10 FILES 20 TRACKS USED
 DATE NAME MODE NO. TRACKS
 5/20/63 MAIN MAD P 15
 5/17/63 DPFA SYMTB P 1
 5/17/63 DPFA BSS P 1
 5/17/63 DPFA FAP P 2

===Peripherals===
Input-output hardware was mostly standard IBM peripherals. These included six data channels connecting to:
* Printers, punched card readers and punches
* IBM 729 tape drives, an IBM 1301 disk storage, later upgraded to an IBM 1302, with 38 million word capacity
* An IBM 7320 drum memory with 186K words that could load a 32K-word memory bank in one second (later upgraded to 0.25 seconds)
* Two custom high-speed vector graphics displays
* An IBM 7750 transmission control unit capable of supporting up to 112 teleprinter terminals, including IBM 1050 Selectrics and Model 35s. Some of the terminals were located remotely, and the system could be accessed using the public Telex and TWX networks.

==Influences==
CTSS was described in a paper presented at the 1962 Spring Joint Computer Conference, and greatly influenced the design of other early time-sharing systems.

Maurice Wilkes witnessed CTSS and the design of the Titan Supervisor was inspired by that.

Dennis Ritchie wrote in 1977 that UNIX could be seen as a &quot;modern implementation&quot; of CTSS. Multics, which was also developed by Project MAC, was started in the 1960s as a successor to CTSS – and in turn inspired the development of Unix in 1969. One of the technical terms inherited by these systems from CTSS is &quot;daemon&quot;.

Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS), another early, revolutionary, and influential MIT time-sharing system, was produced by people who disagreed with the direction taken by CTSS, and later, Multics; the name was a parody of &quot;CTSS&quot;, as later the name &quot;Unix&quot; was a parody of &quot;Multics&quot;. CTSS and ITS file systems have a number of design elements in common. Both have an M.F.D. (master file directory) and one or more U.F.D. (user file directories). Neither of them have nested directories (sub-directories). Both have file names consisting of two names which are a maximum of six-characters long. Both support linked files.

<doc id="254142" wikidata="Q1410737" url="?curid=254142" title="Fibonacci heap">
<text>In computer science, a Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap. Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan developed Fibonacci heaps in 1984 and published them in a scientific journal in 1987. Fibonacci heaps are named after the Fibonacci numbers, which are used in their running time analysis.

The amortized times of all operations on Fibonacci heaps is constant, except &quot;delete-min&quot;. Deleting an element (most often used in the special case of deleting the minimum element) works in formula_1 amortized time, where formula_2 is the size of the heap. This means that starting from an empty data structure, any sequence of &quot;a&quot; insert and &quot;decrease-key&quot; operations and &quot;b&quot; &quot;delete-min&quot; operations would take formula_3 worst case time, where formula_2 is the maximum heap size. In a binary or binomial heap, such a sequence of operations would take formula_5 time. A Fibonacci heap is thus better than a binary or binomial heap when formula_6 is smaller than formula_7 by a non-constant factor. It is also possible to merge two Fibonacci heaps in constant amortized time, improving on the logarithmic merge time of a binomial heap, and improving on binary heaps which cannot handle merges efficiently.

Using Fibonacci heaps improves the asymptotic running time of algorithms which utilize priority queues. For example, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and Prim&#x27;s algorithm can be made to run in formula_8 time.

== Structure ==

A Fibonacci heap is a collection of trees satisfying the minimum-heap property, that is, the key of a child is always greater than or equal to the key of the parent. This implies that the minimum key is always at the root of one of the trees. Compared with binomial heaps, the structure of a Fibonacci heap is more flexible. The trees do not have a prescribed shape and in the extreme case the heap can have every element in a separate tree. This flexibility allows some operations to be executed in a lazy manner, postponing the work for later operations. For example, merging heaps is done simply by concatenating the two lists of trees, and operation &quot;decrease key&quot; sometimes cuts a node from its parent and forms a new tree.

However, at some point order needs to be introduced to the heap to achieve the desired running time. In particular, degrees of nodes (here degree means the number of direct children) are kept quite low: every node has degree at most formula_9 and the size of a subtree rooted in a node of degree formula_10 is at least formula_11, where formula_12 is the formula_13th Fibonacci number. This is achieved by the rule: at most one child can be cut off each non-root node. When a second child is cut, the node itself needs to be cut from its parent and becomes the root of a new tree (see Proof of degree bounds, below). The number of trees is decreased in the operation &quot;delete-min&quot;, where trees are linked together.

As a result of a relaxed structure, some operations can take a long time while others are done very quickly. For the amortized running time analysis, we use the potential method, in that we pretend that very fast operations take a little bit longer than they actually do. This additional time is then later combined and subtracted from the actual running time of slow operations. The amount of time saved for later use is measured at any given moment by a potential function. The potential formula_14 of a Fibonacci heap is given by

:formula_15,

where formula_16 is the number of trees in the Fibonacci heap, and formula_17 is the number of marked nodes. A node is marked if at least one of its children was cut, since this node was made a child of another node (all roots are unmarked). The amortized time for an operation is given by the sum of the actual time and formula_18 times the difference in potential, where &quot;c&quot; is a constant (chosen to match the constant factors in the big O notation for the actual time).

Thus, the root of each tree in a heap has one unit of time stored. This unit of time can be used later to link this tree with another tree at amortized time 0. Also, each marked node has two units of time stored. One can be used to cut the node from its parent. If this happens, the node becomes a root and the second unit of time will remain stored in it as in any other root.

== Operations ==
To allow fast deletion and concatenation, the roots of all trees are linked using a circular doubly linked list. The children of each node are also linked using such a list. For each node, we maintain its number of children and whether the node is marked. 

=== Find-min ===
We maintain a pointer to the root containing the minimum key, allowing formula_19 access to the minimum. This pointer must be updated during the other operations, which adds only a constant time overhead.

=== Merge ===
The merge operation simply concatenates the root lists of two heaps together, and setting the minimum to be the smaller of the two heaps. This can be done in constant time, and the potential does not change, leading again to constant amortized time.

=== Insert ===
The insertion operation can be considered a special case of the merge operation, with a single node. The node is simply appended to the root list, increasing the potential by one. The amortized cost is thus still constant.

=== Delete-min ===
The delete-min operation does most of the work in restoring the structure of the heap. It has three phases:

# The root containing the minimum element is removed, and each of its formula_20 children becomes a new root. It takes time formula_21 to process these new roots, and the potential increases by formula_22. Therefore, the amortized running time of this phase is formula_23.
# There may be up to formula_2 roots. We therefore decrease the number of roots by successively linking together roots of the same degree. When two roots have the same degree, we make the one with the larger key a child of the other, so that the minimum heap property is observed. The degree of the smaller root increases by one. This is repeated until every root has a different degree. To find trees of the same degree efficiently, we use an array of length formula_1 in which we keep a pointer to one root of each degree. When a second root is found of the same degree, the two are linked and the array is updated. The actual running time is formula_26, where formula_17 is the number of roots at the beginning of the second phase. In the end, we will have at most formula_1 roots (because each has a different degree). Therefore, the difference in the potential from before to after this phase is formula_29. Thus, the amortized running time is formula_30. By choosing a sufficiently large formula_18 such that the terms in formula_17 cancel out, this simplifies to formula_1.
# Search the final list of roots to find the minimum, and update the minimum pointer accordingly. This takes formula_1 time, because the number of roots has been reduced.
Overall, the amortized time of this operation is formula_1, provided that formula_36. The proof of this is given in the following section.

=== Decrease-key ===
If decreasing the key of a node formula_37 causes it to become smaller than its parent, then it is cut from its parent, becoming a new unmarked root. If it is also less than the minimum key, then the minimum pointer is updated.

We then initiate a series of &quot;cascading cuts&quot;, starting with the parent of formula_37. As long as the current node is marked, it is cut from its parent and made an unmarked root. Its original parent is then considered. This process stops when we reach an unmarked node formula_39. If formula_39 is not a root, it is marked. In this process we introduce some number, say formula_10, of new trees. Except possibly formula_37, each of these new trees loses its original mark. The terminating node formula_39 may become marked. Therefore, the change in the number of marked nodes is between of formula_44 and formula_45. The resulting change in potential is formula_46. The actual time required to perform the cutting was formula_47. Hence, the amortized time is formula_48, which is constant, provided formula_18 is sufficiently large.

==Proof of degree bounds==
The amortized performance of a Fibonacci heap depends on the degree (number of children) of any tree root being formula_1, where formula_2 is the size of the heap. Here we show that the size of the (sub)tree rooted at any node formula_37 of degree formula_20 in the heap must have size at least formula_54, where formula_12 is the formula_13th Fibonacci number. The degree bound follows from this and the fact (easily proved by induction) that formula_57 for all integers formula_58, where formula_59 is the golden ratio. We then have formula_60, and taking the log to base formula_61 of both sides gives formula_62 as required.

Let formula_37 be an arbitrary node in a Fibonacci heap, not necessarily a root. Define formula_64 to be the size of the tree rooted at formula_37 (the number of descendants of formula_37, including formula_37 itself). We prove by induction on the height of formula_37 (the length of the longest path from formula_37 to a descendant leaf) that formula_70, where formula_20 is the degree of formula_37.

Base case: If formula_37 has height formula_74, then formula_75, and formula_76.

Inductive case: Suppose formula_37 has positive height and degree formula_78. Let formula_79 be the children of formula_37, indexed in order of the times they were most recently made children of formula_37 (formula_82 being the earliest and formula_83 the latest), and let formula_84 be their respective degrees.

We claim that formula_85 for each formula_13. Just before formula_87 was made a child of formula_37, formula_89 were already children of formula_37, and so formula_37 must have had degree at least formula_92 at that time. Since trees are combined only when the degrees of their roots are equal, it must have been the case that formula_87 also had degree at least formula_92 at the time when it became a child of formula_37. From that time to the present, formula_87 could have only lost at most one child (as guaranteed by the marking process), and so its current degree formula_97 is at least formula_98. This proves the claim.

Since the heights of all the formula_87 are strictly less than that of formula_37, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to them to getformula_101The nodes formula_37 and formula_82 each contribute at least 1 to formula_64, and so we haveformula_105where the last step is an identity for Fibonacci numbers. This gives the desired lower bound on formula_64.

==Performance==
Although Fibonacci heaps look very efficient, they have the following two drawbacks:
# They are complicated to implement.
# They are not as efficient in practice when compared with theoretically less efficient forms of heaps. In their simplest version, they require manipulation of four pointers per node, whereas only two or three pointers per node are needed in other structures, such as the binomial heap, or pairing heap. This results in large memory consumption per node and high constant factors on all operations.

Although the total running time of a sequence of operations starting with an empty structure is bounded by the bounds given above, some (very few) operations in the sequence can take very long to complete (in particular, delete-min has linear running time in the worst case). For this reason, Fibonacci heaps and other amortized data structures may not be appropriate for real-time systems.

It is possible to create a data structure which has the same worst-case performance as the Fibonacci heap has amortized performance. One such structure, the Brodal queue, is, in the words of the creator, &quot;quite complicated&quot; and &quot;[not] applicable in practice.&quot; Invented in 2012, the strict Fibonacci heap is a simpler (compared to Brodal&#x27;s) structure with the same worst-case bounds. Despite being simpler, experiments show that in practice the strict Fibonacci heap performs slower than more complicated Brodal queue and also slower than basic Fibonacci heap. The run-relaxed heaps of Driscoll et al. give good worst-case performance for all Fibonacci heap operations except merge. Recent experimental results suggest that the Fibonacci heap is more efficient in practice than most of its later derivatives, including quake heaps, violation heaps, strict Fibonacci heaps, and rank pairing heaps, but less efficient than pairing heaps or array-based heaps.

<text>Johann Simon Hermstedt (29 December 1778 – 10 August 1846) was one of the most famous clarinettists of the 19th century. He is a German who served as court clarinettist to Duke Günther I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and taught the Duke to play the clarinet. All four of Louis Spohr&#x27;s clarinet concertos and several of his other clarinet works were written with Hermstedt&#x27;s skills in mind and were dedicated to him.

<doc id="254149" wikidata="Q4316" url="?curid=254149" title="Project A-ko">
<text>is a 1986 Japanese animated science fiction action comedy film. The film focuses on 16-year-old Japanese teenage schoolgirl A-ko, who defends her best friend C-ko, as they face off against their classmate and rival B-ko while the Earth faces the threat of an alien invasion. It was directed by Katsuhiko Nishijima with Yuji Moriyama did animation direction and character design. The film project initially started as part of the &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; series of original video animation, but later became its own film. The film staff said they were motivated to produce a fun exciting film in contrast to the more serious anime films being produced at the time. Additionally, the film includes a variety of references and parodies a number of other works of anime from the 1970s and 1980s.

The film was largely well received by critics who praised the humor and action and considered it an anime classic. Outside of Japan, the film was seen by many fans of anime which served as an introduction to the medium. The film was followed up by several sequels and a spin-off, starting with &quot;Project A-Ko 2&quot; in 1987. The original 35mm film negatives were once thought lost until they were recovered in 2021.

==Plot==
An alien spaceship crashes into Graviton City, wiping out the entire population and leaving a massive crater where the city is rebuilt 16 years later. High school students A-ko Magami, a perky, fun-loving red-haired, sailor-suited teenage girl, and her best friend C-ko Kotobuki, a bubbly, carefree optimist, enter a new year of school as transfer students at the all-girls Graviton High School. Although A-ko possesses superhuman speed and strength, she considers herself an average teenager. She mostly worries about getting to school on time, due to her habit of chronically oversleeping her alarm clock each morning. The pair catch the unwanted attention of B-ko Daitokuji, a rich, snobbish, spoiled, and brilliant fellow student.

B-ko develops an obsession in regards to C-ko, and is determined to win her over. B-ko&#x27;s attempts to win C-ko over fail, however, and remembering that she was A-ko&#x27;s rival back in kindergarten, B-ko creates a series of mecha piloted by her team of female followers to attack A-ko each morning. After losing each new and more powerful mecha, she eventually creates and dons the &quot;Akagiyama 23&quot;, a powered suit that looks like a bikini. B-ko quickly escalates the fight across the school with no restraint.

Trench-coated spy &quot;D&quot; has been monitoring A-ko and C-ko each morning and reporting back to a large spacecraft as it approaches Earth. The aliens&#x27; conclusion is that they have located a lost princess whom they have been looking for. The aliens finally reach Earth and begin an all-out attack against the Graviton military, which is outmatched by the alien technology. A-ko and B-ko&#x27;s own fight continues across the big city even as the military and aliens do battle. C-ko is abducted in the middle of this confrontation by &quot;D&quot;, who is revealed to be a member of the Lepton Kingdom of Alpha Cygni, an all-female race of aliens. C-ko is their princess.

Witnessing the abduction, A-ko and B-ko set aside their differences. Infiltrating the spaceship, A-ko confronts D and the ship&#x27;s alcoholic Captain Napolipolita, while B-ko rescues C-ko. B-ko then reneges on the truce and opens fire on A-ko, D, and the Captain, destroying the ship&#x27;s navigation system. The vessel lands, precariously perched on top of the city&#x27;s Military Command Tower (actually the remains of the previously crashed ship). Having survived the crash, both A-ko and C-ko find themselves on top of an unconscious B-ko.

A-ko happily awakens the next morning, sore from the previous day&#x27;s adventures, and walks with C-ko to school in their new uniforms. The girls pass by a disheveled D and the Captain begging for donations to repair their ship. The film ends with B-ko smiling as A-ko appears on the horizon.

==Production==
&quot;Project A-ko&quot; was directed by Katsuhiko Nishijima who would later go on to direct &quot;Agent Aika&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth of Flames&quot;. The music for the film features music and songs composed by Richie Zito and Joey Carbone. Nishijima said that he wanted to make a film that directors Mamorou Oshii and Hayao Miyazaki were not able to make which is a light hearted entertaining film without much deep social commentary. Yuji Moriyama is credited with character design and animation director, and previously worked on the &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; television series, and the films &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot;. According to Moriyama, the crew of the film had mostly worked on &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, and felt demoralized after Mamoru Oshii left production of the series, and wished to work on a new project. Moriyama also said that the motivation for making the film was to create a less serious and more entertaining film: The currents [at that time] were shifting favorably towards more serious works that were loaded with meaning and heavy themes. It was a frustrating time for animators who liked to animate. &quot;A-ko&quot; was a deliberate attempt to push all that aside, to provide some mindless fun, to make an action-packed film that would be fun to make and fun to watch. I guess you could say it was an animator&#x27;s anime. Animators who wanted to animate big action but couldn&#x27;t, came together on this project and let it all hang out.

Production of the film included several artists who would later create other popular works, including Kia Asamiya and Atsuko Nakajima.

The title itself is a reference to the 1983 Jackie Chan film &quot;Project A&quot;, although the film bears no resemblance to &quot;Project A&quot;; the working title ended up sticking.

&quot;Project A-ko&quot; was initially planned to be part of the &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; series of pornographic OVAs, but during the production of the series, it was decided to make it into a more mainstream title. The only sequence animated during its &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; days left in the revised production is B-ko&#x27;s private bath scene. In a nod to &quot;Project A-ko&#x27;s&quot; origins as a &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; episode, the owner and several working girls from the brothel in the &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; episode &quot;Pop Chaser&quot; - where director Katsuhiko Nishijima was one of the animators - can be seen in one of the classrooms A-ko and B-ko crash through during a fight sequence in the film.

Moriyama explains that the names &quot;A-ko&quot;, &quot;B-ko&quot;, and &quot;C-ko&quot; were initially placeholder names that were kept throughout production rather than being replaced.

The film&#x27;s format uses a surface plot a high stakes action story, while at the same time making allusions and parodies to a number of other works of anime from the 1970s and 1980s. The classmate Mari alludes to &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, and the character of the Captain Napolipolita is inspired by &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;. Additionally the forward section of the alien spacecraft looks like the ship &quot;Arcadia&quot; from &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;. In addition, the series makes homage to American comics as well, as A-ko&#x27;s parents resemble Superman and Wonder Woman.

== Analysis==
&quot;Project A-ko&quot; contains themes and elements common throughout other anime storylines. Infatuation is a common theme in Japanese anime storylines, where it is typically between a male and a female character, but in &quot;Project A-ko&quot;, the female B-ko is infatuated with another female, C-ko, and tries to separate her from A-ko. Though there are hints that the infatuation may be of lesbian in origin, it appears to be platonic in nature. B-ko is primarily motivated her ego and desire to control C-Ko, and acts like a bully throughout the film. The film contains satire of the kind of sentimental attachments females can have for each other in other anime, such as &quot;Gunbuster&quot;.

The relationship in the film has been described as a lesbian love triangle.

During a screening of the film in 1993, Michael Flores explained the relationship as part of Japanese culture and common in Japanese television and film. In his analysis, women are separated from men until they are about 18 or 19, and women form relationships and have love affairs with each other before they become interested in men, a trope that is explored in Japanese films and TV shows.

Additionally, it is common for anime and manga stories to include women who are independent and often powerful physical warriors, and A-ko is another example of this. Other examples include &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.

The destruction and rebuilding of the city of Tokyo is a common theme throughout Japanese media (including the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and &quot;Akira&quot;). In &quot;Project A-ko&quot;, the Gavitron City is modeled after Tokyo and is rebuilt after the catastrophic destruction of the crashing space ship at the beginning of the film.

==Release==
The film was released to theaters by Shochiku-Fuji on June 21, 1986, alongside a shorter film titled &quot;Going on a Journey: Ami Final Chapter&quot;. Pony Video distributed the film via VHS and LaserDisc later in the year. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on LP, CD, and cassette through Polystar Records on May 25 of the same year. &quot;Dance Away&quot; by Annie Livingston was released as a single simultaneously with the album, with the background music track &quot;Spaceship in the Dark&quot; as the B-side. A Japanese-language version of &quot;Dance Away&quot; and &quot;Follow Your Dream&quot; by was released a month later.

Outside of Japan, many fans of anime would watch the film without subtitles and serve as an introduction to anime films. &quot;Project A-ko&quot; was Central Park Media&#x27;s first video release in 1991 alongside &quot;Dominion Tank Police&quot; and &quot;MD Geist&quot;. They later released a dubbed version produced by Manga Entertainment to VHS in 1992. Both &quot;Project A-ko&quot; and &quot;Dominion Tank Police&quot; were later shown in America on the Sci-Fi Channel during a &quot;Festival of Japanese Animation&quot;.

The album was released in the U.S. in 1994 by Central Park Media under their MangaMusic label and later included as a bonus disc the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; DVD in 2002.

In 1996, a CD-Rom package called &quot;Anime Hyperguide: Project A-ko&quot; was released, including artwork, interviews with the creators.

After releasing &quot;Project A-ko&quot; on DVD in its original widescreen video format, Central Park Media later released a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; version in 2002, which features remastered video and coloring, a large number of &quot;A-ko&quot; related extras, commentary and interviews by many of the &quot;Project A-ko&quot; staff, and a free &quot;Project A-ko&quot; soundtrack CD. Central Park Media has released the three OVA sequels in a single-disc DVD collection, &quot;Project A-ko: Love and Robots&quot;.

In May 2011, Eastern Star released a newly remastered R1 &quot;Project A-ko&quot; DVD. It contains many of the extras of the original CPM release, minus the soundtrack CD. Discotek Media released the film on Blu-ray in December 2021. Originally, the footage for the film was to be sourced from the laserdisc release using the Domesday Duplicator to capture the footage at a higher quality than previous releases, with a technology called AstroRes being used to upscale the footage and restore it to a higher quality. The film was instead sourced from the original 35mm film negatives, which were previously thought lost. The film negatives had been stored in a film laboratory but a clerical error had resulted in confusion as to where it was.

== Reception ==
The film has largely been praised by reviewers who consider it a classic for fans of Japanese anime. The film is considered to be a cult film in the west. The film&#x27;s humor was praised, with Max Autohead from &quot;Hyper&quot; magazine saying that the film hits with its &quot;cheesy&quot; humor. Reviewer Joe Bob Briggs praised the film, citing the more adult subject matter compared to Saturday morning cartoons and crazy action, giving it four out of four stars. He placed the film alongside others such as &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and &quot;&quot; which feature scantily clad women in science fiction adventures causing a lot of mayhem. &quot;J-Fan&quot; praised the English dub and called it one of the best dubs from Manga Entertainment and a &quot;near perfect&quot; example of the genre.

&quot;GameFan&quot; writer Shidoshi considers the film a &quot;must see&quot; film for any serious anime fan, saying it rises above being a mere parody and stands on its own as a work. He also says that it is the best film in the series, with the sequels being the sort of work that the film set out to mock.

&quot;Game Zone&quot; magazine commented that the film is low on violence, but high on humor and girly fight scenes.

Writer James Swallow in &quot;Anime FX&quot; praised the film&#x27;s action and humor, and said that &quot;Project A-ko&quot; and its sister OAVs were an archetype of the genre.

==Sequels==
&quot;Project A-ko&quot; spawned a series of sequels which were original video animation (OVA) starting with &quot;Plot of the Daitokuji Financial Group&quot; in 1987, followed by &quot;Cinderella Rhapsody&quot; in 1988 and then &quot;FINAL&quot; in 1989. After this original series, a spin-off entitled &quot;A-ko the Vs&quot; (1990) was created and released in the OVA format. In this two-part series (a &quot;Grey side&quot; and &quot;Blue side&quot;), A-ko and B-ko are partners hunting monsters in an extraterrestrial environment, with no relationship to the previous series. Central Park Media released it as &quot;Project A-ko: Uncivil Wars&quot;. The film also spawned an American produced comic series, and a tabletop role playing game.

<doc id="254150" wikidata="Q92778" url="?curid=254150" title="J. C. R. Licklider">
<text>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (; March 11, 1915 – June 26, 1990), known simply as J. C. R. or &quot;Lick&quot;, was an American psychologist and computer scientist who is considered to be among the most prominent figures in computer science development and general computing history.

He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer with an early vision of a worldwide computer network long before it was built. He did much to initiate this by funding research that led to significant advances in computing technology, including today&#x27;s canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, which is the direct predecessor of the Internet.

Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC&#x27;s Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Systems Research Center, noted that &quot;most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick&#x27;s vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all&quot;.

== Biography ==
Licklider was born on March 11, 1915, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the only child of Joseph Parron Licklider, a Baptist minister, and Margaret Robnett Licklider. Despite his father&#x27;s religious background, he was not religious in later life.

He studied at Washington University in St. Louis, where he received a B.A. with a triple major in physics, mathematics, and psychology in 1937 and an M.A. in psychology in 1938. He received a Ph.D. in psychoacoustics from the University of Rochester in 1942 as well as a Doctorate in Psychology from the University of Rochester, that same year. Thereafter he worked at Harvard University as a research fellow and lecturer in the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory from 1943 to 1950.

He became interested in information technology, and moved to MIT in 1950 as an associate professor, where he served on a committee that established the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and a psychology program for engineering students. While at MIT, Licklider was involved in the SAGE project as head of the team concerned with human factors. In 1957, he received the Franklin V. Taylor Award from the Society of Engineering Psychologists. In 1958, he was elected President of the Acoustical Society of America, and in 1990 he received the Commonwealth Award for Distinguished Service.

Licklider left MIT to become a vice president at Bolt Beranek and Newman in 1957. He learned about time-sharing from Christopher Strachey at a UNESCO-sponsored conference on Information Processing in Paris in 1959. At BBN he developed the BBN Time-Sharing System and conducted the first public demonstration of time-sharing.

In October 1962, Licklider was appointed head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at ARPA, the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an appointment he kept through July 1964. In April 1963, he sent a memo to his colleagues in outlining the early challenges presented in establishing a time-sharing network of computers with the software of that time. Ultimately his vision led to ARPANet, the precursor of today&#x27;s Internet.

After serving as manager of information sciences, systems and applications at IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York from 1964 to 1967, Licklider rejoined MIT as a professor of electrical engineering in 1968. During this period, he concurrently served as director of Project MAC until 1971. Project MAC had produced the first computer time-sharing system, CTSS, and one of the first online setups with the development of Multics (work on which commenced in 1964). Multics provided inspiration for some elements of the Unix operating system developed at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1970.

Following a second stint as IPTO director (1974–1975), his MIT faculty line was transferred to the Institute&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science, where he was based for the remainder of his career. He was a founding member of Infocom in 1979, known for their interactive fiction computer games. He retired and became professor emeritus in 1985. He died in 1990 in Arlington, Massachusetts; his cremated remains are interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery.

== Work ==
=== Psychoacoustics ===
In the psychoacoustics field, Licklider is most remembered for his 1951 &quot;Duplex Theory of Pitch Perception&quot;, presented in a paper which has been cited hundreds of times, was reprinted in a 1979 book, and formed the basis for modern models of pitch perception. He was also the first to report binaural unmasking of speech.

=== Semi-Automatic Ground Environment ===

While at MIT in the 1950s, Licklider worked on Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE), a Cold War project to create a computer-aided air defense system. The SAGE system included computers that collected and presented data to a human operator, who then chose the appropriate response. He worked as a human factors expert, which helped convince him of the great potential for human/computer interfaces.

===Information technology===
Licklider became interested in information technology early in his career. His ideas foretold of graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate wherever it was needed. Much like Vannevar Bush&#x27;s, Licklider&#x27;s contribution to the development of the Internet consists of ideas, not inventions. He foresaw the need for networked computers with easy user interfaces.

Licklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet. In 1960 his seminal paper on &quot;Man-Computer Symbiosis&quot; foreshadowed interactive computing, and he went on to fund early efforts in time-sharing and application development, most notably the work of Douglas Engelbart, who founded the Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute and created the famous On-Line System where the computer mouse was invented. He also did some seminal early work for the Council on Library Resources, imagining what libraries of the future might look like, which he describes as &quot;thinking centers&quot; in his 1960 paper.

==== Man–computer symbiosis ====

In &quot;Man-Computer Symbiosis&quot;, Licklider in 1960 outlined the need for simpler interaction between computers and computer users. Licklider has been credited as an early pioneer of cybernetics and artificial intelligence (AI), but unlike other AI practitioners, he never felt sure that men would be replaced by computer-based beings. As he wrote in the article: &quot;Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking&quot;. He goes on to write in the same article: &quot;In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone&quot;. This approach, focusing on effective use of information technology in augmenting human intelligence, is sometimes called Intelligence amplification (IA). Peter Highnam, DARPA director in 2020, focused on human-machine partnership as a long-term goal and guiding light ever since Licklider&#x27;s 1960 publication.

==== Project MAC ====

During his time as director of ARPA&#x27;s Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) from 1962 to 1964, he funded Project MAC at MIT. A large mainframe computer was designed to be shared by up to 30 simultaneous users, each sitting at a separate &quot;typewriter terminal&quot;. He also funded similar projects at Stanford University, UCLA, UC Berkeley (called Project Genie), and the AN/FSQ-32 at System Development Corporation.
This time-sharing technology later developed to become what today are known as servers.

==== Global computer network ====

Licklider played a similar role in conceiving of and funding early networking research. He formulated the earliest ideas of a global computer network in August 1962 at BBN, in a series of memos discussing the &quot;Intergalactic Computer Network&quot; concept. These ideas contained almost everything that the Internet is today, including cloud computing.

While at IPTO he convinced Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Lawrence G. Roberts that an all-encompassing computer network was a very important concept. He met with Donald Davies in 1965 and inspired his interest in data communications.

In 1967 Licklider submitted the paper &quot;Televistas: Looking ahead through side windows&quot; to the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television. This paper describes a radical departure from the &quot;broadcast&quot; model of television. Instead Licklider advocates for a two-way communications network. The Carnegie Commission led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Although the Commission&#x27;s report explains that &quot;Dr. Licklider&#x27;s paper was completed after the Commission had formulated its own conclusions,&quot; President Johnson said at the signing of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, &quot;So I think we must consider new ways to build a great network for knowledge—not just a broadcast system, but one that employs every means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use&quot;.

His 1968 paper &quot;The Computer as a Communication Device&quot; illustrates his vision of network applications and predicts the use of computer networks to support communities of common interest and collaboration without regard to location.

In the same 1968 paper, J. C. R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor wrote, &quot;Take any problem worthy of the name, and you find only a few people who can contribute effectively to its solution. Those people must be brought into close intellectual partnership so that their ideas can come into contact with one another. But bring these people together physically in one place to form a team, and you have trouble, for the most creative people are often not the best team players, and there are not enough top positions in a single organization to keep them all happy. Let them go their separate ways, and each creates his own empire, large or small, and devotes more time to the role of emperor than to the role of problem solver. The principals still get together at meetings. They still visit one another. But the time scale of their communication stretches out, and the correlations among mental models degenerate between meetings so that it may take a year to do a week&#x27;s communicating. There has to be some way of facilitating communication among people wit bout [sic] [without] bringing them together in one place.&quot; (Evan Herbert edited the article and acted as intermediary during its writing between Licklider in Boston and Taylor in Washington.)

The Licklider Transmission Protocol is named after him.

<text>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (officially titled The Concise Oxford Dictionary until 2002, and widely abbreviated COD or COED) is one of the best-known of the &#x27;smaller&#x27; Oxford dictionaries. The latest edition contains over 240,000 entries and 1,728 pages (&quot;concise&quot; compared to the &quot;OED&quot; at over 21,000 pages). Its 12th edition, published in 2011, is used by both the United Nations (UN) and NATO as the current authority for spellings in documents in English for international use. It is available as an e-book for a variety of handheld device platforms. In addition to providing information for general use, it documents local variations such as United States and United Kingdom usage.

It was started as a derivative of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), although section S–Z had to be written before the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; reached that stage. However, starting from the 10th edition, it is based on the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; (&quot;ODE&quot;) rather than the &quot;OED&quot;. The most recent edition is the 12th, published in 2011.

====&quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot;====
* 1st Edition (1911): &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot;, adapted by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler ... from the &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot;. (They wrote the last section S–Z before the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; had reached that stage.)
* 2nd Edition (1929): &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot; H. W. Fowler alone (his brother had died in 1918, although his name is still on the title page).
* 3rd Edition: (1934) was revised by H. W. Fowler and H. G. Le Mesurier.
* 4th (1951) and 5th (1964) Editions were revised by E. McIntosh, who introduced the space-saving swung dash that stands for the headword. The title page still read &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot;; but the description read &#x27;edited by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler; based on The Oxford Dictionary&#x27;.
* 6th (1976) and 7th (1982) Editions were still called &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot;, but the subtitle now read &quot;based on the Oxford English dictionary and its supplements&quot; first edited by H.W. Fowler and F.G. Fowler. It was (thoroughly) edited by J.B. Sykes, catching up with the developments in the parent dictionary. In the 7th Edition, symbols were introduced to mark uses considered controversial or offensive.
* 8th Edition (1990): &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot;, first edited by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler was edited by Robert E. Allen. Being computer-based, this edition changed the original structure to a large extent.
* 9th Edition (1995): &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&quot; First edited by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler. Edited by Della Thompson.
* 1st Edition 100th Anniversary Edition (2011): &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary The 1911 First Edition&quot; includes the photocopied version of the 1st Edition dictionary, an introductory essay by renowned language expert David Crystal, a timeline of the chronology through 100 years of COED.

====&quot;The Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;====
* 10th Edition (1999, revised 2001) became &quot;The Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. It was edited by Judy Pearsall. Rather than being a direct revision of the 9th edition, it was based on the larger &quot;New Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; (1998), which Pearsall had edited. Its compilation had involved a re-analysis of much of the core vocabulary using the British National Corpus. The 10th edition was also issued as an electronic resource, as a computer optical disc.
:This edition was to be the last &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot; to be used on &quot;Countdown&quot;, as contestant Helen Wrigglesworth declared ROADSIDE and it was declared illegal. After further inspection from Mark Nyman, the dictionary was found to not have any compound words in it, and was thus abandoned and the show reverted to the 9th edition. The show switched to &quot;New Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; in series 43.

====&quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;====
* 11th Edition (2004, revised 2006, 2008 and 2009), the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; was edited by Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. It was based on the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; (2nd edition (2003), which Soanes and Stevenson had edited). The 11th Edition is available on CD-ROM as an e-book for a variety of platforms.
* 12th Edition (2011), the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; was edited by Angus Stevenson and Maurice Waite. This edition included 400 new entries, including &quot;sexting&quot;, &quot;cyberbullying&quot;, &quot;gastric band&quot;, &quot;jeggings&quot;, &quot;retweet&quot;, and &quot;woot&quot;. Includes 240,000 words, phrases, and definitions; with vocabulary covering technical and scientific vocabulary and international English. It was typeset in Frutiger and Parable typefaces. The CD-ROM version includes 50,000 spoken audio pronunciations, and supports Windows 2000 and above, Mac OS X 10.1 and above.

<doc id="254152" wikidata="Q2526817" url="?curid=254152" title="Windaria">
<text>, also called Legend of Fabulous Battle Windaria and Once Upon a Time, is a Japanese animated film produced by Kaname Productions and Idol. The film was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, and written by Keisuke Fujikawa. It was released theatrically in Japan on July 19, 1986.

==Plot==
The mountainous kingdom of Paro and the coastal city-state of Itha had been at peace for over a century. They would have remained that way but for the ambitions of Paro&#x27;s power-hungry king. Paro invaded Itha, despite the love between Jill, Paro&#x27;s prince, and Ahanas, Itha&#x27;s princess. Caught between duty and emotion, the star-crossed lovers were forced to fight a war to its bitter conclusion. Meanwhile, Isu was a simple farmer from the neutral village of Saki, but he saved Itha from being destroyed by a spy from Paro, and found himself hungering for wealth and glory that the Ithan monarchy couldn&#x27;t provide. Agents from Paro made him an offer to fulfill his wishes, and he left his wife Marin behind in what would turn into a battlefield between the two kingdoms.

==Voice cast==
==Production==
&quot;Windaria&quot; is based on a novel of the same name, authored by Keisuke Fujikawa, the film&#x27;s screenwriter. Fujikawa&#x27;s resume includes the live-action &quot;Ultraman&quot; and the animated series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, &quot;Grendizer&quot;, and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;. The film was produced by animation companies Kaname Productions and Idol and directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, who previously worked on &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot; and &quot;GoShogun&quot;. Studio Gallop was responsible for its photography and Studio Cosmos contributed the backgrounds. Mutsumi Inomata acted as both character designer and animation director. The film&#x27;s instrumental musical score was composed by Satoshi Kadokura. The vocal theme was written by Kazuhiko Katō and performed by J-pop singer Akino Arai. The ending theme was written and performed by Arai. Arai stated that she did not discuss the composition of the tracks with the director as she would have later in her career.

===Soundtrack===
==Release and marketing==
&quot;Windaria&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on July 19, 1986. In 1987, Harmony Gold licensed &quot;Windaria&quot; for release in the United States, trimming the film from its original 101-minute running time to 95 minutes. The English-language version was edited in order to better market the film to younger audiences. According to director Carl Macek, Harmony Gold was given no scripts or translations of the property and they thus had little insight into the plot details. The English version included a new script, an altered plot with a happy ending, scenes switched around, violent and adult-oriented scenes removed, the entire cast given Anglicized names, and added narration provided by Russell Johnson (of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; fame).

&quot;Windaria&quot; was first distributed in Japan to home video by Victor Entertainment. The eventual laserdisc release contained a trailer, a pilot film (in which characters are colored differently than the final version), and a second audio track. Victor released &quot;Windaria&quot; on DVD in Japan on December 16, 2000. This release forgoes the laserdisc extras but includes a director interview on the insert. Atlus reissued the film on DVD on March 25, 2005. Streamline Pictures released the English version, titled &quot;Windaria&quot;, on North American VHS between 1992 and 1993. A laserdisc version was planned by Image Entertainment yet never distributed. ADV Films re-released the English version, as &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, on DVD on March 23, 2004. The uncut Japanese version has never been officially released in this region.

A generous amount of &quot;Windaria&quot;-related merchandise has been marketed in Japan since the film&#x27;s 1986 debut. Fujikawa&#x27;s &quot;Douwa Meita Senshi Windaria&quot; &quot;bunkobon&quot; was published by Kadokawa Shoten during March 1986. Shortly after the premiere of &quot;Windaria&quot;, several official guide books were released, one (&quot;Settei: Windaria&quot;) containing Idol&#x27;s sketches, storyboards, and promotional materials. A special &quot;omake&quot; was published on August 25, 1986, as part of Kadokawa&#x27;s &quot;Mediamix Special&quot; imprint. Inomata&#x27;s 1988 art book &quot;Gatsu no Koe Hoshi no Yume&quot; contains some of her illustrations from the film. Arai&#x27;s album &quot;Natsukashii Mirai&quot;, containing both the film&#x27;s opening and ending themes, was released by Victor on October 21, 1986. Arai later re-recorded &quot;Utsukushii Hoshi&quot; for her 2005 album &quot;Sora no Uta&quot; due to her dissatisfaction with the first version of the song. The film&#x27;s original soundtrack was released by Victor on both LP and CD on July 21, 1986, and CD was reprinted on March 24, 1994. It was reissued on June 23, 1999 alongside the soundtrack to &quot;Birth&quot;, another anime by Kaname. Finally, a 2008 Nintendo DS video game based on the film was developed by Compile Heart under the name and released in Japan.

==Reception==
Critical reception for the original Japanese version of &quot;Windaria&quot; has been favorable. Ralph Jenkins of &quot;Mania.com&quot; called the film &quot;the quintessential anime tragedy&quot;. The reviewer elaborated: &quot;The overriding theme of this grim allegory is that a promise—especially between lovers—is something so sacred that it thrives even beyond death, and taking it for granted can beget devastating consequences&quot;. Jenkins noted both Inomata&#x27;s character designs and the film&#x27;s musical score to be memorable.

<doc id="254154" wikidata="Q1279214" url="?curid=254154" title="Argument from free will">
<text>The argument from free will, also called the paradox of free will or theological fatalism, contends that omniscience and free will are incompatible and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inconceivable. See the various controversies over claims of God&#x27;s omniscience, in particular the critical notion of foreknowledge. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination.

==Omniscience and free will==

Some arguments against the existence of God focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing free will and God&#x27;s omniscience. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination.

Noted Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides described the conflict between divine omnipotence and his creation&#x27;s person&#x27;s free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

A &quot;standard Anglican&quot; theologian gave a similar description of Christian revelation:
A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:
# God knows choice &quot;C&quot; that a human would claim to &quot;make freely&quot;.
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual &quot;possibilities&quot; due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

Norman Swartz, however, contends that the above arguments commit the modal fallacy. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see modal logic). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.

Other means of reconciling God&#x27;s omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from coercion, and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by compatibilistic philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.

A proposition first offered by Boethius and later by Thomas Aquinas and C. S. Lewis, suggests that God&#x27;s perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not &quot;foresee&quot; events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
A common objection is to argue that Molinism, or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig, amongst others.

==Free will argument for the nonexistence of God==
Dan Barker suggests that this can lead to a &quot;Free will Argument for the Nonexistence of God&quot; on the grounds that God&#x27;s omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have free will, God is not a personal being.

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is omniscient, but there is some disagreement about whether &quot;omniscient&quot; means:
# &quot;knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know&quot;; or instead the slightly stronger:
# &quot;knows everything that is logically possible to know&quot;

These two terms are known as &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;total&quot; omniscience, respectively.

<doc id="254158" wikidata="Q7978180" url="?curid=254158" title="Weasel war dance">
<text>The weasel war dance or mustelid war dance is a colloquial term for the behavior of excited ferrets and other members of the weasel subfamily. Naturalists speculate that weasels in the wild use the dance to confuse or disorient prey.

==In domestic ferrets==
In domestic ferrets the war dance usually follows play or the successful capture of a toy or a stolen object. The war dance is commonly held to mean that the ferret is thoroughly enjoying itself.

The behavior consists of a frenzied series of hops sideways and backwards, often accompanied by an arched back and a frizzed-out tail. Ferrets are notoriously clumsy as they dance and will often collide with or fall over objects and furniture.

The war dance usually includes a clucking vocalization, known among domestic ferret owners as &quot;dooking&quot;. It normally indicates happiness. Although the war dance may make a ferret appear frightened or angry, they are often just excited and are generally harmless to humans.

==In the wild==
The stoat (also known as the ermine or the short-tailed weasel) reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a &quot;dance&quot; (sometimes called the weasel war dance), though this behaviour could be linked to &quot;Skrjabingylus&quot; infections. In fact, all weasels, e.g., the least weasel, the European polecat, the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret, etc., dance when they&#x27;ve caught or killed their prey in the wild.

<doc id="254159" wikidata="Q381803" url="?curid=254159" title="Regional Municipality of Durham">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Durham (), informally referred to as Durham Region, is a regional municipality in Southern Ontario, Canada. Located east of Toronto and the Regional Municipality of York, it forms the east end of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and is part of the Golden Horseshoe region. It has an area of approximately . The regional government is headquartered in Whitby.

The southern portion of Durham Region, on Lake Ontario, is primarily suburban in nature, forming the eastern end of the &quot;905 belt&quot; of suburbs around Toronto, while the northern portion comprises rural areas and small towns. The city of Pickering, town of Ajax, and the township of Uxbridge are part of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area, while the communities of Oshawa, Whitby, and Clarington comprise the Oshawa Census Metropolitan Area.

==Administrative divisions==
Durham Region consists of the following municipalities (in order of population):

It also contains one First Nations reserve: Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation.

==Local government==
==History==

The Region of Durham was established in 1974 as one of several new regional governments in the Province of Ontario, primarily in fast-growing urban and suburban areas. It encompasses areas that had been part of Ontario County and the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, and was the culmination of a series of studies into municipal governance in the &quot;Oshawa-Centred Region&quot; that had begun in the late 1960s.

The boundaries of the region were different from what had been anticipated and announced in late 1972. For example, it was widely expected that Pickering would be annexed to Metropolitan Toronto, which residents had supported in a ballot question. In addition, the region was proposed to extend further east to include Hope Township and the town of Port Hope, and did not include the northern townships of Scott, Brock and Thorah.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, the Durham Region has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). On average July is the hottest month while January is the coldest month.


==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Regional Municipality of Durham had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==

With a current population of 700,000, the population is expected to exceed one million by 2041. Of considerable potential impact to the future of the economy in Durham Region is the proposed federal airport in north Pickering. The federal government acquired 18,600 acres of land in Pickering under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1972 for the construction of a future airport. However, the project has remained in limbo since and much of the land has been leased for farming. In January 2018, a report released by Urban Strategies, Inc. indicated that the Pickering airport lands provide the best opportunity to meet the growing demand for air travel and goods movement in the Greater Toronto Area, demand that Toronto Pearson airport will eventually be unable to accommodate.

As of December 2016, Durham Region had over 250 energy, environment, and engineering related businesses that employed over 11,000 individuals, making Durham Region the top employer of energy sector professionals in the Greater Toronto and Hamiton Area (GTHA). Durham Region&#x27;s agricultural sector is one of the largest primary goods-producing sectors in the region. The agriculture sector is supported by local organizations such as Durham Farm Fresh who assist in the marketing, promotion, and advocacy for local food. The film industry is active and growing in Durham Region, due to increasing demands for locations and talent across Ontario. In June 2015, a major film studio development was announced in Pickering. Canada’s largest film industry backlot opened in Pickering in late 2021.

The innovative technology sector is emerging in Durham Region, supported by a Regional Innovation Centre in Oshawa and a technology accelerator in Whitby. Whitby is the location of the headquarters of 360 Insights a significant employer in Durham Region.

83 per cent of Durham residents over 18 have a certificate, diploma or degree.

The unemployment rate is 5.4% as of March 2022. Emerging employment sectors in Durham Region include sustainable energy, local food production, bio-sciences, next-generation automotive, logistics, advanced manufacturing, construction, and technology.

Major employers in Durham Region include General Motors of Canada, Ontario Power Generation, Lakeridge Health, Durham District School Board, Durham College, the Ontario Ministry of Finance, Minacs Worldwide, TDS Automotive, and University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

=== Manufacturing and energy industries ===

Durham Region is a major centre of the automotive industry in Canada. Oshawa is the Canadian headquarters of General Motors and home of what was once GM&#x27;s largest plant in North America. In addition, the Canadian headquarters of Volkswagen is located in the region, BMW was located in the region until moving to Richmond Hill in 2010. The worldwide recession and spike in oil prices resulted in large-scale layoffs at GM beginning in 2008, along with the closure of the Oshawa Truck plant in 2009. This dramatically reduced employment levels at GM, and also resulted in significant employment losses and closures in the auto parts industry. On November 26, 2018, General Motors announced that no future product would be allotted to Oshawa beyond 2019 and that manufacturing operations would cease in December 2019. In October 2019, General Motors announced the construction of a 55-acre autonomous vehicle test track in Oshawa to be named the Canadian Technical Centre (CTC) McLaughlin Advanced Technology Track. GM Canada then reopened the plant in Oshawa and began manufacturing trucks in November 2021.

Durham Region is the Clean Energy Capital of Canada. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) is the largest employer in the region. OPG is Canada&#x27;s largest owner of nuclear power plants with responsibility for operating the Pickering A, B, and Darlington nuclear generating stations, all of which are located in Durham Region. In June 2019 OPG announced it would be building a new corporate campus in Durham Region, in the Municipality of Clarington, by 2024. In 2023, Ontario Power Generation announced they were changing plans and had purchased the former General Motors Canada head office building and were updating it to be their new corporate headquarters. Ontario Tech University offers the first accredited program of its kind in Canada with an undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering. It is also a leader is Energy Systems and Nuclear Science programs. The Clean Energy Research Lab (CERL) is a facility focused on pioneering clean energy research.

===Tourism===

Tourism is a significant economic sector in Durham Region. Durham Region currently hosts more than four million visitors each year, who spend over $300 million.

*, a privately owned toll freeway, enters the region south of Highway 7 and travels east to Durham Regional Road 1 (Brock Road) before transitioning to a provincially owned highway, Highway 407E. This route travels generally parallel to Highway 7 until the community of Brooklin in Whitby extending east to Highway 35 / 115 towards Lindsay and Peterborough.
*, part of the Highway 407E project, connects south to Highway 401 parallel and east of Durham Regional Road 23 (Lakeridge Road).
*, opened on December 9, 2019, runs between Durham Regional Road 34 (Courtice Road) and Road 57 (Waverley Road) from Highway 401, southwest of Bowmanville, north to near Hampton (north of Durham Regional Road 4 (Taunton Road)), connecting with the extension of Highway 407.

===Other highways===
* 
* 
* 
* (now Durham Highway 2)
* (now Durham Highway 47)

This is the only region of the Greater Toronto Area where the Trans-Canada Highway passes through. The TC&#x27;s Central Ontario Route enters from the northeast at Manilla along Highway 7, makes an abrupt turn near Sunderland onto Highway 12 heading north towards Beaverton and the northern regional boundary.

===Public transportation===
Public transit in the Region is operated by Durham Region Transit, which was formed in January 2006 when the five preexisting municipal public transit systems in the region were merged under the Region&#x27;s administration.
In addition, GO Transit provides the following services within the Region:
*Lakeshore East GO Trains serve Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, and Oshawa GO Stations, providing connections to Toronto&#x27;s Union Station
*Morning Highway 401 peak hour service to Finch Bus Terminal from Oshawa GO Station via Whitby GO Station, Ajax GO Station and Scarborough Town Centre, with reverse service in the afternoon

===Air travel===
Although small airports such as the Oshawa Executive Airport exist in Durham Region, the main airport serving the region is Toronto Pearson International Airport. There is a long-standing proposal for a major new airport in Pickering.

===Maritime Infrastructure===

Durham Region also has a small maritime industry centered on the Port of Oshawa. The port received around 50 lake freighters per year between 2007 and 2017 and acts as an export terminal for agricultural products from Durham and nearby regions.

==Education==
The Durham District School Board operates all English-language secular public schools within Durham Region, except for those schools within Clarington, which are part of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board. This is a holdover from the pre-1974 structure in which the area now forming Clarington was part of Durham County, while the other municipalities were part of Ontario County.

The Durham Catholic District School Board operates the separate English-language public Catholic school system within Durham Region, again with the exception of schools in Clarington, which are part of the Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board.

Neither school board is an operating division of the regional government. Instead, as is true of all school boards in Ontario, they are separate entities with distinct but overlapped service areas. Elected public trustees responsible for their operation.

French-language school boards serving the municipality include the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir.

Durham Secondary Academy and Middle School offers private elementary and secondary education for students in the Region of Durham.

The region also is home to Ontario Tech University, Ontario&#x27;s fastest growing university, Durham College, and Trent University Durham (Trent University&#x27;s main campus is in Peterborough). The Ontario Tech and Durham College main campuses are located in north Oshawa. Durham College also has a satellite campus in Whitby, and Ontario Tech has one in Downtown Oshawa.

Ontario Tech University is a science, technology engineering and math (STEM)-focused, research driven institution. Ontario Tech is home to the [ACE Climatic Wind Tunnel, a research, development and testing facility available for rent to manufacturers of all descriptions, startup companies and researchers in Canada and around the globe. Ontario Tech University is rated number 1 in cross-sector research among Canadian undergraduate universities. Within 15 years of its founding, Ontario Tech quickly earned a reputation for computer science, ranking among the top 10 programs in Canada and 4th in Ontario.

Durham College has campuses in Oshawa and Whitby, and has nine academic schools across a wide range of disciplines.

Trent University Durham offers full and part-time undergraduate programs, as well as post-graduate certificates. Other key programs at Trent University Durham include Bachelors of Business Administration, Computing Systems, and Communications &amp; Critical Thinking as well as a Master of Management, which is a 16 month professional master program. Trent University Durham announced in 2019 plans to expand their campus in Oshawa to include 200 on-campus residences, &quot;creative learning spaces&quot;, and academic space.

<text>The Toronto Argonauts (officially the Toronto Argonaut Football Club and colloquially known as the Argos) are a professional Canadian football team based in Toronto, Ontario. The Argonauts compete in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Founded in 1873, the team is the oldest professional sports team in North America still using its original name, as well as the oldest-surviving team in both the modern-day CFL and East Division. The team&#x27;s origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the 19th century. The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre (originally known as SkyDome) from 1989 until 2016, when the team moved to BMO Field, the fifth stadium site (on the footprint of their third home Exhibition Stadium) to host the team. 

The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 19 times and have appeared in the final 25 times. Most recently, they defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 41–24 in the 111th Grey Cup in 2024. The Argonauts hold the best winning percentage in the championship game (.760) and have the longest active winning streak in games in which they have appeared, at eight. The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup, while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

The team was founded and owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years, and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956. The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades, with attendance peaking in the 1970s. In May 2015, a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment&#x27;s Larry Tanenbaum (via the Kilmer Group) and Bell Canada reached an agreement to acquire the team. The sale included a scheduled move to the MLSE-run BMO Field for the 2016 season, which had long been proposed given poor attendance at Rogers Centre. MLSE announced in December 2017 that it had agreed to purchase the team outright, with the deal finalized on January 19, 2018. The previous owners continue to indirectly own stakes in the Argos, as Bell Canada and the Kilmer Group respectively hold 37.5% and 25% stakes in MLSE.

Given the length of franchise history, dozens of players, coaches, and management have been honoured in some form over the years. The team recognizes a select group of players with retired numbers - early greats Joe Krol and Dick Shatto, stalwart offensive lineman Danny Nykoluk, and Michael &quot;Pinball&quot; Clemons, who has been the most recent face of the team. 
==Name and colours==
Since the team&#x27;s foundation in 1873, the Argonauts name has been in continuous use, a record in North American professional sports. The Chicago Cubs (1870) and the Atlanta Braves (1871) franchises of Major League Baseball are older, but both teams have changed their name more than once, and the Braves have also changed cities. The Argonauts are the oldest professional football team in North America.

The name &quot;Argonauts&quot; is derived from Greek mythology: according to legend, Jason and the Argonauts were a group of heroes who set out to find the Golden Fleece aboard the ship &quot;Argo&quot; sometime before the Trojan War. Given its nautical theme, the name Argonaut was adopted by a group of amateur rowers in Toronto in 1872. The Argonaut Rowing Club, which still exists today, went on to found the football club with the same name a year later. Given their roots in a rowing squad, the team is often referred to as &quot;the Boatmen&quot; and less often &quot;the Scullers&quot;.

In the 19th century, the most renowned rowing teams in the world were from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England. The Toronto rowers, many of whom had associations with the English schools, adopted uniforms incorporating the light blue of Cambridge and the dark blue of Oxford. In turn, the footballers adopted the colours and the phrase &quot;double blue&quot; became synonymous with the team. Blue has become the traditional colour of top-level teams in Toronto (e.g. the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays).

The team&#x27;s other official colour is white. Its current helmet design features a Cambridge blue background, with the team logo featuring a boat incorporating a football.

== History ==
=== 1873–1906 ===
The first recorded game of what would become known as Canadian football was played in Toronto on November 9, 1861, featuring University of Toronto students. At the time, the game was a modified version of English rugby, which gained popularity throughout the 1860s. Rugby itself was still an infant game having evolved out of association football (soccer) in the 1830s. Seeking a way to keep fit after summer, the Argonaut Rowing Club (ARC) formed their own rugby-football squad on October 4, 1873. The Argonauts Football Club played their first game against Hamilton on October 18 of that year (a victory), beginning a storied rivalry. H.T. Glazebrook was their first captain and head coach. Establishment of the football team was formalized by the ARC on September 17, 1874, with a subscription fee of one dollar charged per player.

The football team played a handful of challenge matches—one team inviting another to play—as an amateur squad against university and city teams every year throughout the 1870s, with one dormant year in 1879, likely due to injuries. In 1883 the Toronto Football Club, other city teams from Ontario and university squads from Toronto, Queens University and Royal Military College formed the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU); it was the first rugby football organization with a league and playoff structure in North America. The Toronto Football Club were league victors in the first year. Starting in 1884, a &quot;Dominion Championship&quot;—a precursor to the Grey Cup—was held, pitting the victors of the country&#x27;s two organized leagues, the ORFU and Quebec Rugby Football Union (QRFU), against each other; it was organized nationally by the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) from 1892 onwards. In the first true national championship, the Montreal Football Club defeated the Toronto Football Club on November 6, 1884, by a score of 30–0. Argonauts lost the Dominion Title in 1901 to Ottawa College. The Ottawa Football Club and the Hamilton Football Club were frequent opponents in this era.

Over the thirty years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were incrementally introduced into the game, including the adoption of the line of scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes at the turn of the century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Among other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.

The Argonauts merged with the Toronto Football Club in 1905, and W. A. Hewitt was manager of the Argonauts until 1907. He was also vice-president of the ORFU for the 1905 and 1906 seasons, and sought for ORFU to have uniform rules of play with the CRU, with a preference to use the snap-back system of play. When the CRU did not adopt the snap-back system, his motion was approved for the ORFU to adopt the CRU rules in 1906.

=== 1907–1952 ===
In December 1906, &quot;The Gazette&quot; reported that a proposal originated from Ottawa for the ORFU and the QRFU to merge, which would allow for higher calibre of play and create rivalries. Hewitt helped organize the meeting which established the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) in 1907. Seeking looser rules regarding the employment of professional players, Toronto and other cities split from the ORFU and formed the IRFU, along with Hamilton, Ottawa, and Montreal.

The IRFU continued under the larger auspices of the Canadian Rugby Union. Beginning in 1909, the CRU champion was awarded the Grey Cup, with the Big Four competing against university squads and eventually teams from Western Canada. The Argonauts first competed for the Cup in 1911, losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto in front of a then record 13,687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium. The team claimed their first championship in 1914, exacting revenge on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory. Their star runner and kicker in their first championship year was Jack O&#x27;Conner, who scored a league record 44 points.

After play was halted during World War I, the Argos again achieved success in the early 1920s on the back of one Canada&#x27;s greatest ever sportsmen. Lionel Conacher, the &quot;Big Train&quot;, led the team to two perfect 6–0 seasons in 1921 and 1922. In the first season he accounted for 85 of his team&#x27;s 167 points, and 15 of the points in the Grey Cup game, a 23–0 drubbing of the Edmonton Eskimos. It was the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history.

The 1921 Grey Cup victory was their last until 1933, at which point the Argonauts became the dominant team of an increasingly nationwide sport. They put together a number of Grey Cup dynasties in the 1930s and 1940s, winning eight of twenty Grey Cups between 1933 and 1952. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were most often on the receiving end of Argo Grey Cup victories in this era. From 1933 to 1941 Lew Hayman coached the team with a still unparalleled winning ratio of 45–15–2. Their first back-to-back Grey Cups came in 1937 and 1938. This was also the era of the famed Stukus brothers—Annis, Bill, and Frank—who proved a potent all-purpose trio in the Argonauts&#x27; championship years.

Joe &quot;King&quot; Krol and Royal Copeland, the so-called &#x27;Gold Dust Twins&#x27;, were the best-known players of the 1940s. In an era where players still played multiple positions, they were a threat in every capacity: running, passing, catching, kicking, and playing defence. Often connecting with each other for points, they led the Argos to a Grey Cup threepeat between 1945 and 1947. In 1948, the team broke a cultural barrier with the signing of Ken Whitlock as not only their first import player in quite some time but also their first ever black player. Whitlock played only 4 games as a halfback &amp; punter before getting released from the team, but his signing also ushered a new era for player acquisitions. 1949 and 1950 marked a watershed in Argonauts history as the team began large scale importation of American players for the first time. In 1950, the Argos signed their second ever black player after Whitlock, Ulysses &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Curtis. Curtis played five strong years with the team as their featured running back.

Frank Clair was brought in as coach in 1950 and left his mark on the revamped roster; he led the team to Grey Cup wins in 1950 and 1952. The first of these was a 13–0 victory over Winnipeg in the notorious Mud Bowl. A November snowstorm followed by mild conditions turned Varsity Stadium into a bog and the play was a shambles; one Winnipeg player is reported to have almost drowned in the muck.

At some time during this period, the phrase &quot;Argo Bounce&quot; came to refer to the Argonauts&#x27; propensity to receive a lucky bounce of the football. The phrase may date to the Grey Cups of the 1930s, all of which featured improbable bounces and fumbles favouring the Argos; the phrase was popularized in print by Annis Stukus in the 1940s. It is still in use today, with a number of fortunate on-field happenings attributed to the &quot;bounce&quot;.

===1953–1988===
The three decades after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts&#x27; Dark Ages. A year after winning the Grey Cup, the Argos crashed to dead last in the Big Four. It was the start of a 31-year stretch without a Grey Cup, and for the first 19 of those years, they only got as far as the second round of the playoffs. Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For the first time in decades, they were a fixture at or near the bottom of the East. The management style under new owner John W. H. Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s. In 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.

The Argonauts did have some standout players in the 1950s and 1960s. The stalwart of the era was Dick Shatto, an Ohioan who played twelve seasons from 1954 to 1965. Listed as a running back, Shatto was a dual threat to run and receive and continues to hold the team regular season records for touchdowns (91) and total yards gained (6,958). Living in Toronto year round, Shatto set down deep roots in the city and eventually became the Argonauts&#x27; general manager. Another American, Tobin Rote, set numerous passing marks in three years at quarterback from 1960 to 1962. Known for his good living off the field, Rote still holds the Argos single game passing record with 524 yards against Montreal on August 19, 1960. A pillar on the offensive line was Danny Nykoluk at tackle, whose career spanned 17 seasons from 1954 to 1971, including one stretch of 12 years where he did not miss a single game. Despite the presence of these veterans, the era was marked by losing seasons and high attrition on the roster. By the 1960s, the annual (and often desperate) mid-season addition of American imports had become known as the &quot;Argo airlift&quot;; American imports often did not last a game before being cut.

Eventually, the team became competitive again under head coach Leo Cahill in the late 1960s. They scored a coup over the National Football League (NFL) with the signing of a young Joe Theismann (and other American stars) in 1971. The team also saw an attendance bounce, consistently selling out Exhibition Stadium. The Boatmen&#x27;s best chance to end their Grey Cup drought came that year, when they faced the Calgary Stampeders in the 59th Grey Cup, the first to be played on artificial turf. In a defensive struggle at Vancouver&#x27;s soggy Empire Stadium, a now infamous late fumble by Leon &quot;X-Ray&quot; McQuay and a possession-changing kick out of bounds by Harry Abofs sealed a 14–11 Stampeder victory.

Aside from 1971, the 1970s were tumultuous for the team, with numerous hirings and firings of head coaches and consistent losing records. There were stellar players over this era, including defensive all-stars such as Jim Stillwagon, Jim Corrigall, and Granville &quot;Granny&quot; Liggins, but the team could not return to winning form. High-profile moves such as hiring Canadian football icon Russ Jackson as head coach in 1975 or signing running back superstar Anthony Davis the next year turned into busts. Ironically, the Argos reached historic attendance highs in this losing decade—regular season average per game attendance reached 47,356 in 1976. The enlargement and reconfiguration of Exhibition Stadium over 1975 and 1976 in anticipation and preparation of the Blue Jays expansion baseball team (who began play in 1977) allowed for these massive crowds.

The Argos reached an all-time low in 1981 when they finished 2–14; this despite having such talented players as quarterback Condredge Holloway, running back Cedric Minter, and receiver Terry Greer. The team began the year 0–10 and there was talk of a &quot;perfect&quot; losing season. The team had been inept so long by this point (29 seasons without a Grey Cup win) that the notion of an &quot;Argo Bounce&quot; had become inverted; now &quot;it was the unluckiest bounce in the world, the one that usually arose from the Argos&#x27; uncanny ability to lose critical games in the dying minutes by committing an improbable blunder.&quot;

However, with the 1982 season came the hiring of Bob O&#x27;Billovich as head coach and Mouse Davis as offensive co-ordinator. Davis implemented the run and shoot offense, and the Argos enjoyed a turnaround, going 9–6–1 that year; Condredge Holloway was the CFL&#x27;s most outstanding player. The team ultimately fell short in their quest for a Grey Cup, losing 32–16 in a driving rainstorm to the mighty Edmonton Eskimos (in the last of their five consecutive Grey Cup titles) in the final in front of a disappointed crowd at Exhibition Stadium. The 1983 season finally brought the championship home. The Argos finished 12–4 and Terry Greer set a CFL record with 2,003 receiving yards. Joe Barnes and Condredge Holloway were a potent duo at quarterback. The Double Blue returned to the Grey Cup, this time facing the BC Lions at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver. Despite the hostile crowd, Toronto defeated BC 18–17 to win their first Grey Cup since 1952. The Argos were generally competitive for the remainder of the 1980s, thanks in large part to talented players such as Gill &quot;The Thrill&quot; Fenerty and Darrell K. Smith, but a return to the glory of 1983 proved elusive (outside of an appearance in the 1987 Grey Cup game, in which they lost in the last minute to the Edmonton Eskimos 38–36).

===1989–2015 ===
The 1989 season saw the Argonauts move into SkyDome, a multi-purpose downtown stadium with a retractable roof. It marked the beginning of an eventful few years. In 1990, one of the most beloved figures in Toronto sporting history emerged on the team: Michael &quot;Pinball&quot; Clemons set a CFL record for all purpose yards with 3,300 in his first full year, a record he broke in 1997 with 3,840.

In 1991 Hollywood prestige arrived in the form of a new ownership trio. Bruce McNall, owner of the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings, bought the team. One of his players, hockey great Wayne Gretzky, became a minority owner, as did Canadian-born comedian John Candy. The group stunned the league with the signing of Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail for an unheard of $18.2 million over four years. Ismail immediately impressed, particularly on kickoff returns, and was named player of the game in the 1991 Grey Cup, which the Argos won 36–21 over the Calgary Stampeders. Clemons and quarterback Matt Dunigan (who played the final with a broken collarbone) were the other critical pieces to the championship.

However, the Argos slumped to 6–12 only a year later, beginning a slide that only accelerated when Dunigan and Ismail left after the season. The 1992 season was the first of four consecutive losing seasons; while they made the playoffs in 1994, they were promptly eliminated by the Baltimore Stallions in the division semi-finals. Trouble also struck off the field. McNall put the team on the market in 1993 citing massive losses and the strain of being an absentee owner. Labatt Brewing Company, parent of league broadcast partner The Sports Network, bought the team in May 1994. The sale would have closed sooner if not for Candy&#x27;s death in March. McNall would have likely had to sell the team in any event; he confessed to conspiracy and fraud later that year.

Attendance also began to slide in the mid-1990s, raising questions over the team&#x27;s viability that persist to this day. The per game average was just above 16,000 in 1994 and 1995, much less than half the team&#x27;s 1970s peak.

Championship material did eventually reemerge in 1996. The team hired Don Matthews, who was fresh off a Grey Cup victory with the Baltimore Stallions to be the team&#x27;s new head coach and signed Doug Flutie, one of the greatest quarterbacks in CFL history, to a contract and surrounded him with key personnel. The team included linebacker Mike O&#x27;Shea, veteran wide receiver Paul Masotti, and running back Robert Drummond. Derrell &quot;Mookie&quot; Mitchell was added at receiver in 1997. The Boatmen took the Grey Cup in both 1996 and 1997. Flutie set team records for single season passing yards with more than 5,500 in each year and for touchdowns thrown with 47 in 1997 (one less than his CFL record of 48) before crossing the border to join the Buffalo Bills the next year. Masotti retired in 1999 as the team&#x27;s all time pass reception yardage leader. Clemons ended his own successful career in 2000 before returning to coach until 2007.

The years after their back-to-back championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos. Ticket sales remained flat, and there were changes in ownership. Gimmicks to attract fans were greeted with criticism. The Argos seemingly bottomed out in July 2003 when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz. The team had amassed debts of over $20 million, including $17.4 owed to Schwarz himself.
New ownership under David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski brought immediate dividends with another Grey Cup win in 2004. Veteran Damon Allen led the team to a 27–19 victory over the B.C. Lions, with Jon Avery a critical running threat. Allen continued with the team until 2007, and retired with professional football&#x27;s all-time leading passing yardage (72,381).

The Argonauts saw winning seasons from 2005 to 2007 before bottoming out the next two years. They finished 2009 with just three wins. Critical players over this half-decade included receiver Arland Bruce III, defensive star Byron Parker, and all-star punter Noel Prefontaine. The team generated some controversy in 2006 when they lured running back Ricky Williams from the NFL. Williams had repeatedly violated NFL drug policies and was under suspension for the year; he played just one season with the Argos.

In 2010 the team again saw an ownership change, with construction magnate David Braley, who also owns the Lions, taking control. After breaking even in 2010 and going 6–12 in 2011, the Argonauts again acquired a championship nucleus in 2012. Ricky Ray was brilliant at quarterback while Chad Owens emerged as arguably the league&#x27;s best special teams player. Owens broke Michael Clemons CFL record for all purpose yards and won the CFL Most Outstanding Player award that year. The 2012 Grey Cup was played in Toronto and the team took their first championship victory in the city since 1952, a 35–22 win over Calgary.

===2016–present ===
After years of being run on a shoestring budget by owner David Braley and facing the prospect of being evicted out of its longtime home, Braley sold the club to a consortium, led by Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment chairman Larry Tanenbaum and BCE Inc, a move that solidified the franchise&#x27;s long-term future.

The Argos moved out of Rogers Centre and into BMO Field for the 2016 season. Despite the initial hype of playing at a fan-friendly outdoor facility, the club finished at the bottom of the standings with a 5–13 record. A front office purge followed, with the firing of general manager Jim Barker on January 24, 2017. Head coach Scott Milanovich, who was facing an uncertain future with the Argos in the wake of Barker&#x27;s firing, quit four days later, accepting the quarterbacks coach position for the Jacksonville Jaguars under Doug Marrone.

Looking to start afresh both on and off the field, the Argos hired former Montreal Alouettes general manager Jim Popp and head coach Marc Trestman on February 28, 2017. Popp and Trestman won consecutive Grey Cup championships in 2009 and 2010. Popp, the architect of the Alouettes&#x27; resurgence in the Montreal sports scene, acquired some of his former players, such as S. J. Green and Bear Woods.

In August 2017, the team moved their practice facility to the former Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School, with a short-term lease of the facility from the Toronto Catholic District School Board.

Despite missing most of the free agency period and having mere months to assemble both a roster and coaching staff, the Double Blue finished the year with a 9–9 record, good enough for first place in a weak East Division and a first-round bye. After a thrilling last-minute comeback win in the Eastern Final over Saskatchewan, 25–21, the Argos capped off the season in true Cinderella fashion, with another thrilling comeback, winning their 17th championship in the 2017 Grey Cup. Their 27–24 win over Calgary marked their second Grey Cup victory against the Stampeders in five years.

In 2018, the team&#x27;s new owners Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment moved the team&#x27;s practice facility to the nearby MLSE managed Lamport Stadium with the football operations staff moving to BMO Field and the nearby MLSE managed Coca-Cola Coliseum.

Since 2015, the team has averaged the lowest home attendance in the CFL every year, their lowest average (in a non-pandemic affected year) being 12,431 in 2015. The Argonauts won their 18th Grey Cup championship in team history in 2022, hanging on to defeat the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, 24–23.

==Championship summary==
The Toronto Argonauts currently lead the CFL in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup. Early success in the final can partly be attributed to the weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team&#x27;s success is not merely a historical aberration, however: they have won nine of their 12 appearances since the formation of the CFL, including their last eight straight.

For the entire Grey Cup era some form of playoffs has led up to the Grey Cup game; the 24 Argonauts teams who have won a spot in the final would, in modern terms, be called &quot;Eastern Division Champions&quot;. However, the route to the Grey Cup, participating teams, and playoff format have changed repeatedly over time. During the years that they competed in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (1907–1957) the Argonauts won the James Dixon Trophy (awarded to the IRFU playoff champion) 14 times, going on to win the Grey Cup on 10 of these occasions. The Argonauts, in the CFL era (since 1958), hold a 7–3 record in the Grey Cup title, despite not winning their first Grey Cup as a CFL team until 1983.

As for the regular season, the CFL records 14 Argonauts teams at the top of the eastern divisional table since its formation in 1958. Earlier data for the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union provides another 9 years from 1907 to 1957 in which the Argos were the best of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, for a total of 23 divisional wins. The only pre-1958 year in which the Argos won the IRFU but failed to make a Grey Cup appearance was 1922, when they lost in the Eastern Canada final to Queen&#x27;s University.

Going back to an even earlier era, the Argonauts won the Ontario Rugby Football Union championship three times between 1883 and 1906, including the league&#x27;s first two seasons, 1883 and 1884. Their last victory as ORFU members came in 1901. Given their losses in the Dominion Championship in 1884 and 1901, the Argonauts did not earn the title &quot;national champion&quot; until their first Grey Cup win in 1914.

==Stadiums==
The Toronto Argonauts&#x27; first home was Rosedale Field at Mount Pleasant Road and MacLennan Avenue near the city centre. The team suggests its capacity was 10,000 total with 4,000 seated, though O&#x27;Leary and Parrish list smaller numbers, noting that a $32,000 renovation in 1883 allowed for a capacity of 2,000. The field has historic significance as the site of the first Grey Cup game in 1909; the CFL lists the game&#x27;s attendance as 3,807. The field still exists as part of Rosedale Park, although there are no grandstands.

Sources again differ on when the team permanently moved to Varsity Stadium on the grounds of the University of Toronto. The team gives dates of 1874–1897 and 1908–1915 at Rosedale, while other sources suggest the team had moved to Varsity by 1911. Varsity became indelibly linked with the Argonauts and the early years of Canadian football; it was the home field of the great Argo dynasties of the 1930s and 1940s. For most of the Argos time at the stadium, its capacity was about 16,000, but this jumped above 20,000 with a renovation in 1950. Although it has not hosted a professional game since 1958, it still holds the record for hosting the most Grey Cups with 30.

Another home beckoned in 1959 with the renovation of the new Exhibition Stadium (also called CNE Stadium) to accommodate Canadian football. Often remembered ruefully by Torontonians for its exposure to weather, as well as poor sightlines after it was converted in the 1970s to additionally accommodate baseball, the stadium was nevertheless the site of the Argos&#x27; greatest attendance in the late 1960s and 1970s. Particularly brutal conditions at the 70th Grey Cup in 1982 paved the way for the construction of a domed stadium in Toronto.

Rogers Centre (Skydome before 2004) had provided the Argonauts a marquee venue from 1989 to 2015, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 looked sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment did, at least, remove the elements and was an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities to find a new home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.

It was announced in 2013 that Rogers Centre&#x27;s artificial turf would be replaced by natural grass within five years to better facilitate Toronto Blue Jays baseball. Replacing the playing surface would require permanently locking Rogers Centre into its baseball configuration, making it impossible to host CFL games. (However, since this time the stadium has retained its artificial turf surface [albeit with a full dirt infield], and it is unclear whether it will be replaced.) The stadium issue generated significant press and raised concerns over the team&#x27;s long-term viability given that the Argonauts&#x27; losses have been estimated anywhere from $2 to $6 million annually. While various stadium rumours swirled over the course of David Braley&#x27;s tenure (including building a new facility), it became increasingly clear that a move to a renovated BMO Field was the only viable option.

The BMO Field move became finalized on May 20, 2015, concurrent with the announcement of the team&#x27;s sale to a consortium of MLSE shareholders Larry Tanenbaum and Bell Canada. The team moved following the completion of stadium renovations for the 2016 season. The $120 million renovation plan had originally been announced in March 2014, and raised the stadium&#x27;s seating capacity from 21,566 seats to 30,000 for soccer, with 25,000 seats in CFL configuration (due to space and safety issues, the endzones are only 18 yards deep [as opposed to the standard 20 yards], with part of both end zones covered in artificial turf, the remainder of the field has natural grass), and is temporarily expandable with additional endzone seating to 40,000 for big events such as a Grey Cup. The agreement required MLSE to reach a &quot;long-term use (i.e. 20 years)&quot; lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium. The inclusion of the CFL configuration had partly been at the insistence of the City of Toronto government, which owns BMO Field, and had been planned in the original stadium agreement.

Following the demolition and reconstruction of the 5,000 seat Varsity Stadium at the University of Toronto, the Argos returned to the stadium, hosting preseason games from 2013 to 2015. The team also acquired a much-needed training facility in July 2014 when it was announced that MLSE had partnered with the Argonauts to expand KIA Training Ground, Toronto FC&#x27;s new state-of-the-art academy and training facility.

Since 2018, after Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment became the new owners of the Argonauts, the team has used Lamport Stadium as their practice field, while their weight rooms are at Coca-Cola Coliseum; both locations are within walking distance of BMO Field. Since 2022, the Argonauts have used Alumni Stadium in Guelph as their home stadium for preseason games.

== Ownership and management ==

===Ownership history===
For more than eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole property of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team&#x27;s complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John W. H. Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 to be set up that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He sold his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett&#x27;s controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting.

The Bassett years of the late-50s to early-70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but consistent success at the turnstiles. An issue that has become a perennial concern in the city also emerged at this time: the possibility of a National Football League team in Toronto. Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett&#x27;s moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.

Hodgsen sold to Carling O&#x27;Keefe in 1979, who had been minority owners since 1976. The brewing company&#x27;s total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At the time it was rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that reached $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O&#x27;Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.

The year&#x27;s following the Carling O&#x27;Keefe era were marked by increasingly short ownership stints. Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team off Carling O&#x27;Keefe for $5 million at the end of 1988 and then sold to the trio of Bruce McNall (60%), John Candy (20%), and Wayne Gretzky (20%) for the same amount in 1991. Of the three, Candy is best remembered for his emotional investment in the team and a team player award continues in his honour. The era was tumultuous despite a Grey Cup win in 1991, and the last in which the club regularly made front-page headlines. After a little over three years of ownership, McNall concluded he could no longer justify massive losses from an asset 3,000 miles away from his base in Los Angeles. He sold the now money-losing team to the Labatt Brewing Company through its TSN unit in May 1994 for $4.5 million; the closing was delayed by Candy&#x27;s unexpected death that March. At the time, Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, Labatt was acquired by Interbrew; The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the worst Argo attendance of the modern era. Interbrew soon lost interest in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz.

After the debacles of the Schwarz era and brief control of the team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was optimism surrounding the duo&#x27;s arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley&#x27;s takeover. He was simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski&#x27;s initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.

By 2014 Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment and its chairman and minority owner Larry Tanenbaum had emerged as serious suitors for the team. On May 20, 2015, it was announced that an agreement had been reached for Argonauts to be sold to Tanenbaum&#x27;s Kilmer Sports and Bell Canada, who both own a stake in MLSE with Rogers Communications. Financial details were not disclosed. Despite its shared stake in MLSE, Rogers was not interested in having an ownership share in the Argonauts because it does not have any media relationships with the CFL (unlike Bell, whose TSN division holds the broadcast rights to the league). Argonauts Holdings Limited Partnership, a holding company which Bell and Kilmer each own 50% of, formally acquired the franchise on December 31, 2015.

On December 13, 2017, MLSE announced that it would acquire the Argos. This sale transferred ownership from Tanenbaum&#x27;s Kilmer Sports and Bell Media to MLSE, which itself is owned by Tanenbaum, Bell Media and Rogers Communications. The sale was finalized on January 19, 2018 and with the sale, MLSE owns four of the five major professional sports franchises in the city of Toronto (only the Blue Jays are not owned by MLSE, although its owner, Rogers Communications, has 37.5% ownership stake of MLSE).

=== Senior executives ===
Below the ownership level, the two most senior positions within the Toronto Argonauts organization are its president and general manager. The GM role was titled as &quot;managing director&quot; from 1957 to 1966, when head coach Bob Shaw was also named &quot;manager&quot; of the team, &quot;with full operating control&quot;, and managing director Lew Hayman was named club president. The role of club president had formerly been an honorary position; Hayman was the first president with a salary and executive role. The president role is now included in the title of CEO.

The longest serving executive in the organization is Lew Hayman, who had a five-decade career beginning in the 1930s as coach and administrator. A Jewish-American, Hayman served with both the Argos and Montreal Alouettes and has been called &quot;the architect of Canadian football&quot;. He was the team&#x27;s first president and managing director at the insistence of Eric Cradock in 1957, and would continue in the former role until 1981. Ralph Sazio took over from Hayman and is another hall of fame builder.

After relative stability at the senior executive level for three decades, there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 and 2003. The current GM is Mike &quot;Pinball&quot; Clemons who was appointed to the position in October 2019. Chris Rudge, former head of the Canadian Olympic Committee, took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2015, when Michael Copeland took over. The most recent president was Bill Manning who was also president of Toronto FC.

=== Head coaches ===
Fifty-nine men have been Toronto Argonauts head coach. The most recent coach, Ryan Dinwiddie, was appointed following the end of the 2019 season, and led the team to a Grey Cup victory in 2022.

The longest total tenure at head coach belongs to Bob O&#x27;Billovich, who led the team for eleven years over three stints in the 1980s and early 90s. Other notable coaching careers include those of Joe Wright, Sr. at the end of the nineteenth century, Ted Morris and Frank Clair in the post-war years, Leo Cahill in the late 60s and early 70s, and Pinball Clemons after the turn of the millennium.

Since 1961, the Canadian Football League has awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy annually to the league&#x27;s outstanding coach. (Alongside his playing career, Stukus achieved fame as a coach, promoter, and newspaper columnist.) Argonauts coaches have been honoured nine times: Cahill (1971), O&#x27;Billovich (1981 &amp; 1987), Adam Rita (1991), Don Matthews (1997), Jim Barker (2010), Milanovich (2012), Trestman (2017), and Dinwiddie (2023).

==Broadcasts==
Argonauts games are currently carried on TSN&#x27;s national and regional television channel as part of &quot;CFL on TSN&quot; broadcasts. Radio coverage is carried on CHUM (AM) or on CFRB 1010 when there is a scheduling conflict and another sport is being carried on TSN Radio.

Notable broadcasters for the Argonauts include John Badham who had three tenures on three separate radio stations and later inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Rivalries==

With few teams, but a long history, it is inevitable that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game&#x27;s greatest rivalries are showcased.

To the east, the Argonauts have also faced off against teams from Montreal and Ottawa since their earliest days. In recent years, the Montreal Alouettes have consistently fielded strong teams and often run up against the Argos in the playoffs; the teams have faced off eleven times in the Eastern Final, with Montreal taking six.

In 2014, the Argonauts reignited their historic rivalry with an Ottawa football Team as the team came back as the Ottawa REDBLACKS (Other rivalries with Ottawa consisted of rivalries with the Ottawa Renegades and the Ottawa Rough Riders). In 10 games against the current Ottawa franchise (as of the end of the 2017 season) the Argos have a winning record of 7–3–0.

At the Grey Cup level, the Argonauts have faced an assortment of teams in recent decades rather than any one team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams&#x27; five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto in the first years of the Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts&#x27; first win in 1914.

== Notable personnel ==

The highest distinction the Toronto Argonauts can accord a player is to retire their number; just four players have received the honour. Starting in 1996, the team began another category of distinction with its list of &quot;All-Time Argos&quot;. Twenty-four players have been rewarded so far and a banner in their honour hangs at BMO Field.

Players and management personnel may be separately inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. A total of 56 people who have been part of the team are in the Hall. The All-Time Argos list does not extend back to before the Second War era while the Hall of Fame does. Thus, for instance, Lionel Conacher is in the Hall but not listed as an All-Time Argo.

Finally, players may be honoured on an annual basis through the CFL awards. The most prestigious of these is the Most Outstanding Player Award, awarded since 1953. Seven Argonauts have been recipients: Chad Kelly (2023), Chad Owens (2012), Damon Allen (2005), Doug Flutie (1996 &amp; 1997), Michael &quot;Pinball&quot; Clemons (1990), Condredge Holloway (1982), and Bill Symons (1968).

=== All-Time and Hall of Fame ===
== Mascot ==
Jason is the mascot for the Toronto Argonauts, replacing the previous mascot, Bounce, in 2005, who in turn replaced Scully, in 2003.

<text>The Saskatchewan Roughriders are a professional Canadian football team based in Regina, Saskatchewan. The Roughriders compete in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as a member club of the league&#x27;s West Division. The Roughriders were founded in 1910 as the Regina Rugby Club. Although Saskatchewan was not the first team to play football in Western Canada, the club has maintained an unbroken organizational continuity since their founding. The Roughriders are the fourth-oldest professional gridiron football team in existence today (only the Arizona Cardinals, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts are older). The Roughriders are both the oldest professional sports team still in existence that continuously has been based in Western Canada and the oldest in North America to continuously have been based west of St. Louis, Missouri. The team changed their name to the Regina Roughriders in 1924, and to the current moniker in 1946. The Roughriders played their home games at historic Taylor Field from 1936 to 2016; in 2017, the team moved to the newly constructed Mosaic Stadium at Evraz Place.

The team draws fans from across Saskatchewan and Canada who are affectionately known as the Rider Nation. The Roughriders play in the smallest market in the CFL, and the second-smallest major-league market in North America (only Green Bay, Wisconsin is smaller). They have finished first in what is now the West Division eight times and have won the Western championship a record 28 times. They have played for the Grey Cup 19 times, winning four (1966, 1989, 2007, 2013).

The team has had 20 players inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. The Riders&#x27; biggest rival is the Winnipeg Blue Bombers; games between the two are often sold out before the beginning of the season. The Roughriders Football Club and the city of Regina have hosted the Grey Cup four times (1995, 2003, 2013, 2022).

==Community ownership==

=== Ownership ===
The Saskatchewan Roughrider Football Club Inc. was established in 1910 and incorporated in 1940. The organization is registered under the Non-Profit Corporations Act of Saskatchewan. The Roughriders are one of two CFL teams with non-profit ownership, the other one being the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and are among a select group in North American sports. Prior to 2004, the club operated as a corporation without share capital (no person or entity &quot;owned&quot; the team or any portion of it), an ownership structure the Blue Bombers have used continuously.

=== Membership shares ===
Since 2004, the Roughriders have offered two classes of permanent Membership Interests (referred to as &quot;Membership Shares&quot;) similar to the NFL&#x27;s Green Bay Packers. Class A shares have voting rights and Class B shares have no voting rights. As of March 2019, the Roughriders had issued 11,639 Class A shares and 435 Class B shares, though the total number of individual owners is not publicly disclosed.

It is not possible to resell these shares, no dividend payment is possible and no person may hold more than 20 voting (Class A) shares, though they may hold an unlimited number of non-voting shares. The initial public offering of Rider Shares (Series I) commenced in 2004 at an offering price of $250 per share In 2006 the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; reported that the Roughriders had sold around 3,000 at $250 each. The Series 1 offering closed in 2008 after all 6,000 shares were sold. A second public offering, Series II, was launched in 2010 in honour of the team&#x27;s 100th anniversary. As of 2016, the Roughriders had released and subsequently sold out 1,989 shares of Series III at $250 each. this Series &quot;commemorates the 1989 Grey Cup championship victory&quot; and &quot;features the likenesses of Kent Austin, Bobby Jurasin and Don Narcisse with an illustration of the championship winning kick in the background.&quot; Series IV shares began sale in 2017, with the price remaining consistent at $250.

When shares are purchased, the funds are placed in the team&#x27;s Stabilization Fund.

=== Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation ===
The Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation was created in 2019. It raises and distributes funds, focusing on community pillars of education, health, and amateur football. The Foundation aims to teach youth skills such as leadership, resilience, and responsibility.

==History==
===Club origins, Regina Rugby Club (1910–1923)===

The team was founded as the &quot;Regina Rugby Club&quot; on Tuesday, September 13, 1910, adopting the colours of old gold and purple. The team was also a founding member of the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union as it was organized on September 22 of that year. Regina played their first game against the Moose Jaw Tigers on October 1, 1910, at the Moose Jaw Baseball Grounds where they were defeated 16–6. After going winless in their inaugural season, Regina quickly became the strongest team in the province. For the 1911 season, the team changed their colours to blue and white to match the Regina Amateur Athletic Association.

Regina went 3-1 in their second season and captured their first SRFU championship by winning a one game tiebreaker playoff against Moose Jaw. Meanwhile, the Western Canada Rugby Football Union had been formed within the three prairie provinces with the intent of creating a playoff format to determine a Western champion. Much to the displeasure of the SRFU, the Albertan and Manitoban unions had agreed to a format (ostensibly to minimize travel) in which the MRFU champion would host the Western semi-final and the ARFU champion would host the Western final. Regina balked at the prospect of playing up to two road games, and refused to participate in the inaugural WCRFU playoffs.

The Regina Rugby Club changed their colours again in 1912 to red and black. Meanwhile, the WCRFU agreed to change the playoff format so that the SRFU champion was given a bye to the Western final in exchange for the Saskatchewan champion agreeing to play the championship game on the road. Regina began an era of western football dominance. From 1912 through 1920, Regina not only won six consecutive WCRFU titles, but went undefeated in competitive play during that span. Due to World War I, no Western playoffs were held in 1916 and in 1917 and 1918 league play was halted altogether.

In 1921, the Western champion was invited to compete for the Grey Cup national championship for the first time. Regina again went undefeated in the regular season, but were required to play the Saskatoon Quakers for the provincial championship as travel difficulties had prevented Saskatoon from playing the other southern teams. Regina defeated Saskatoon, but the result was overturned after a successful protest concerning an early touchdown which had provided the decisive points. The Quakers won the rematch to mark the only time other than their inaugural season that the Regina Rugby Club did not win the SRFU championship while it was their primary competition. Ultimately, the Edmonton Eskimos travelled east to play in the 9th Grey Cup.

The team&#x27;s rise to early prominence came even as it led a somewhat nomadic existence. It originally played at Dominion Park, but after the war was forced to move to the city exhibition grounds after the city sold Dominion Park. In 1921, it moved to Park Hughes on 10th Avenue in the North Central section of Regina, a rugby and soccer field built in 1910. It was the first season at an address that remained associated with the club for parts of the next nine decades.

In 1923, Regina returned to power as they won their eighth western championship over the Winnipeg Victorias and earned the right to compete in the national playoffs. The club was given a bye and advanced straight to the Grey Cup finals for the first time, but were severely outmatched, losing 54–0 to Queen&#x27;s University at Varsity Stadium in Toronto. This was, and still is, the most lopsided defeat in Grey Cup history as the defending champion Queen&#x27;s won their third straight national championship at the expense of the Regina Rugby Club.

===Regina Roughriders (1924–1945)===
Following their first Grey Cup loss, the club changed their name to the &quot;Regina Roughriders&quot; in 1924 while retaining the colours of red and black. Ottawa also had a team called the Ottawa Rough Riders, but the spelling was different and the two clubs played in different leagues then (incidentally, however, both clubs shared the same colours of red and black then). The origin of the name has multiple theories, the most credible of which describes how the North-West Mounted Police were called Roughriders because they broke the wild horse broncos that were used by the force and the moniker was adopted from them. Giving credence to this theory is that during this time, the team occasionally played at the RNWMP/RCMP barracks when the then-rudimentary facilities at Park Hughes were rendered unsuitable for play by inclement weather. For a long time, the playing surface at Park Hughes was little more than dirt, and heavy rain often turned the field to a muddy bog.

An alternative, discredited story states that the name was adopted from Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s cavalry contingent that was known as the Rough Riders, who fought in the Spanish–American War. It was believed that there were Canadian troops in the contingent who returned to Canada following the war. However, this story is more often associated with the Ottawa club. While it has been suggested that some of the troops may have eventually moved out west, the Roughriders did not adopt their name until 1924, by which time the Spanish–American War was (especially in Canada) barely a historical footnote compared to the then-much more recent (and much more climactic) First World War. Following World War I, any attempt to deliberately name a Canadian sports team in honour of a unit that participated in an earlier American war would have been extremely unpopular.

During the first two years after their name change, the Roughriders failed to reclaim their western championship title, losing both times to clubs from Winnipeg. The 1926 season marked the beginning of their next reign of dominance as the club matched their own WCRFU record with seven consecutive western championships from 1926 to 1932. With dominant players such as Canadian Football Hall of Famer Eddie James, the Roughriders were a perennial contender from the West, reaching the Grey Cup finals five consecutive years from 1928 to 1932, the second-longest streak in the championship&#x27;s history (the team did not challenge for the Cup in 1926 or 1927). Unfortunately, Regina remained winless in the national championship, being outscored 102–15 in those five Grey Cup games. The Roughriders won their last WCRFU title in 1934, representing the west for the seventh time in the 22nd Grey Cup, but lost to the Sarnia Imperials in that club&#x27;s first Grey Cup win.

In 1928, Park Hughes was combined with Park de Young, a neighbouring baseball field, to create a much larger football venue. However, from 1929 to 1935, the Roughriders played most of their games at the larger exhibition grounds.

===Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936–1958)===
In 1936, Regina joined the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Calgary Bronks as the founding franchises of the Western Interprovincial Football Union, the highest level of Canadian football play in Western Canada. Also in 1936, the first permanent grandstand was built at Park Hughes and Park de Young. The Riders moved to the facility full-time that season. The stadium, renamed Taylor Field in 1946, was the Riders&#x27; home for over eight decades. The Roughriders became the first WIFU champions after they defeated the Blue Bombers and Bronks in the West Semi-Finals and West Finals respectively. However, due to a rules dispute with the Canadian Rugby Union over use of their five import players from the United States, Regina was barred from competing for the 24th Grey Cup. Winnipeg had won the Grey Cup championship one year earlier with seven imports and the move to prevent Regina from competing was seen as a reaction to the previous year&#x27;s western win. While the Roughriders had planned on travelling east without the five ineligible players, the CRU remained steadfast in their decision to disallow the team from competition.

The next decade in the WIFU was not as successful as the first as the team did not win another Western Final as the Regina Roughriders, nor ever finish in first place in that time span. After qualifying for the playoffs in three of their next five seasons, play from 1942 to 1944 was interrupted by World War II. While there was no regular season in 1945, the Roughriders did play the newly named Calgary Stampeders in the West Semi-Finals, but lost the series two games to none.

With the folding of both clubs in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, the Regina Roughriders became a provincially community-owned club (and has remained so since), and, consequently, changed their name to the &quot;Saskatchewan Roughriders&quot; in 1946. It is the first recorded instance of a major-league team in North America branding itself as a statewide or provincewide team. Prior to the 1948 season, the Roughriders were in need of new uniforms as their red and black ones had become old and worn out. While visiting a surplus store in Chicago, executive member Jack Fyfe found a set of green and white uniforms and purchased them for the Roughriders. Green and white have remained as the team&#x27;s primary colours to this day (although the team has also worn silver and black as accent colours since then at times). The name change was made official on April 1, 1950.

After three years of first-round playoff exits, the Roughriders finally returned to prominence in 1951, winning their first WIFU regular season championship with an 8–6 record. Saskatchewan, led by quarterback Glenn Dobbs, defeated the Edmonton Eskimos in the West Final and advanced to the Grey Cup for the first time since 1934. In this game, they faced the Ottawa Rough Riders for the first time, marking the first Roughriders versus Rough Riders championship game in Canadian football history. Unfortunately, Saskatchewan still did not win their first championship, as they were defeated by Ottawa 21–14 in the 39th Grey Cup.

Saskatchewan contended on and off in the 1950s, with four consecutive winning seasons and second-place regular season finishes from 1953 to 1956. Teams from this era featured standouts such as Frank Tripucka, Reggie Whitehouse, Ken Carpenter, Mike Cassidy, player-coach Frank Filchock and Cookie Gilchrist who was the first Roughrider player to rush for 1,000 yards in 1958. Even with that talent, they could not return to the Grey Cup as clubs fielded by either the Edmonton Eskimos and Winnipeg Blue Bombers ended their season in each of these years. Their strongest season was in 1956 when the Roughriders achieved a 10–6 record and won their first playoff series since 1951, only to lose to the Eskimos in the Western Finals.

Following their 1956 campaign, tragedy struck the Roughriders franchise when four members of the team were killed in a plane crash on December 9, 1956, while returning from the Canadian Football Council (CFC) All Star Game in Vancouver. Gordon Sturtridge, Mel Becket, Ray Syrnyk, and Mario DeMarco were killed when Flight 810 crashed into Slesse Mountain near Chilliwack, British Columbia. The team retired the numbers of the four players shortly after the tragedy. The following season, the Roughriders finished with seven fewer wins and a last place finish in the WIFU.

===Ken Preston Era (1958–1978)===

1958 brought not only change, as the Saskatchewan Roughriders became charter members of the newly formed Canadian Football League in 1958, but also stability with Ken Preston becoming the General Manager—a position he held for the next 20 years, arguably the most successful tenure in Roughrider history as the team only missed the playoffs five times, went to five Grey Cup final games, winning one in 1966. In the Roughriders&#x27; first season in the newly formed Canadian Football League, the team finished with a respectable 7–7–2 record and a third-place finish. However, the following season proved to be the worst in franchise history, as the team finished with just one win and 15 losses under head coach Frank Tripucka, the third-worst winning percentage in CFL history. The following years featured similar results, with various head coaches, as the Roughriders missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, their worst such streak since joining the WIFU in 1936.

===Ronnie and George show (1963–1975)===
Following a 1962 season that saw the Roughriders return to the playoffs, the team made roster moves that defined a generation of football in Saskatchewan. In the off-season, the Roughriders signed fullback George Reed from Washington State to replace Fred Burket, who had been traded to the Alouettes. Then, prior to their season opening game of the 1963 season, general manager Ken Preston acquired Ottawa Rough Riders quarterback and defensive back Ron Lancaster on July 30 on a straight cash basis following three years with the Eastern Riders. The duo contributed to a productive season for Saskatchewan as they finished with a 7–7–2 record and won a playoff series for the first time since 1956 before losing their first playoff match-up with the BC Lions. The Roughriders continued to make progress in the next two seasons, posting back-to-back winning records, but lost in the West Semi-Finals in both years.

===Eagle Keys Era (1965–1970)===
====1966 Grey Cup champions====
In 1965 after one year as the offensive coordinator, Eagle Keys became the head coach of the Roughriders and guided them to an 8–7–1 record and an appearance in the western semi final which they lost to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 15–9. Fullback George Reed finished the season with over 1,700 yards rushing. Before the 1966 season began, the team added the final pieces to the roster by signing defensive tackle Ed McQuarters who was a recent cut by the St. Louis Cardinals, safety and backup quarterback Bruce Bennett, defensive end Don Gerhardt and running back Paul Dudley from the Stampeders. During the 1966 season the Roughriders finally captured the Western Conference regular season title with a 9–6–1 record. This was the first time they had accomplished that feat since 1951. Ron Lancaster won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the Western Conference&#x27;s most outstanding player while George Reed, receiver Hugh Campbell and four other Riders were named league all-stars, the most from any team that year. Saskatchewan swept Winnipeg in the West Finals, winning two games to no losses, and qualified for the ninth Grey Cup final in franchise history. In the 54th Grey Cup, Saskatchewan once again faced the Ottawa Rough Riders in a rematch of the 1951 championship game. After the score was tied 14–14 at halftime, Saskatchewan scored 15 fourth-quarter points to win the franchise&#x27;s first Grey Cup championship 29–14 on November 26, 1966. Saskatchewan was the last of the original nine CFL franchises to win the Grey Cup, doing so in Vancouver at Empire Stadium. George Reed was the MVP with 31 rushes for 133 yards and one rushing touchdown.

The Roughriders began the 1967 season as defending champions for the first time in franchise history. They finished in second place in the West with a franchise-best 12–4 record and advanced to Grey Cup final once again, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 24–1. The 1968 season saw the Roughriders finish with the best record in the league at 12–3–1, although they placed 1st in the west division they lost the western final series to the Calgary Stampeders 2–0 by a combined score of 57–12. Besides the 1st-place finish another highlight of the season was coach Eagles Keys winning the Annis Stukus Trophy awarded to the coach of the year. The Roughriders finished in first place in 1969 and defeated the Stampeders to qualify for another Grey Cup. In the Grey Cup against the Ottawa Rough Riders, Saskatchewan fell 29–11 in their third Grey Cup game in four years. The Roughriders won a franchise-best 14 games in 1970, a record that stands to this day, but were upset in the West Finals by the Stampeders. Eagle Keys resigned during the following off-season, ending his career as the all-time leader in wins by a Saskatchewan Roughrider head coach with 68 wins and four first-place finishes.

===John Payne era (1973–1976)===

Dave Skrien was hired as the next head coach of the Roughriders and led them as they continued their winning ways, namely with an appearance in the 1972 Grey Cup, which yielded another Saskatchewan loss to Hamilton. For the 1973 season the Roughriders hired head coach John Payne. The Riders then had three consecutive second-place finishes and West Final losses to the Edmonton Eskimos, ending when George Reed retired after the 1975 season as the all-time leading rusher in all of professional football with 16,116 rushing yards. In 1976, the Roughriders recaptured first place in the Western Conference and defeated the Eskimos in the West Final, advancing to the Grey Cup to once again play the Ottawa Rough Riders. The Roughriders allowed a last-minute touchdown catch by Ottawa tight end Tony Gabriel to lose their fourth Grey Cup in ten years, ending one of the most bittersweet eras in Roughrider history. Saskatchewan had qualified for the playoffs for 15 consecutive seasons, tied for fourth-best in CFL history, and played in 11 consecutive Division Finals, which is a CFL record. While they also posted the best regular season record in all of professional football over that time period, the team only won one championship during that time.

===Post-Ron Lancaster era (1979–1986)===
After their loss in the 1976 Grey Cup game to the Ottawa Rough Riders, coach John Payne left the team to become head coach of the Detroit Lions and Saskatchewan fell into a drought that was unheard of in the CFL. They posted an 8–8 record in 1977, but finished in fourth place. It was the start of an 11-year playoff drought, the longest in CFL history. The Roughriders had several talented players during this era, including Joey Walters at receiver, Vince Goldsmith at defensive end, offensive lineman Roger Aldag from Gull Lake and Dave Ridgway, who became one of the greatest kickers in CFL history. However, in an era where the West was dominated by Edmonton, Winnipeg and (by the early 1980s) the B.C. Lions, the Roughriders often found themselves in a losing battle for the third and final playoff spot in the West.

Franchise quarterback Ron Lancaster retired after the 1978 season as the CFL&#x27;s all time passing leader in passing yards, completions and touchdown passes. Furthermore, he is the only Roughrider to win the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award twice while playing with Saskatchewan. Playing without Lancaster behind centre for the first time in 16 seasons proved difficult as the team posted back-to-back 2–14 seasons in 1979 and 1980. Ironically, the head coach of those squads was none other than Lancaster himself. The Riders&#x27; only winning record during this time came in 1981 when they finished with a 9–7 record under Joe Faragalli, but it was only good enough for fourth place in a competitive West Division – the &quot;crossover rule&quot; had not yet been implemented – therefore, as in 1977, the Riders were denied a playoff spot despite the third place Eastern team having a worse record (the Montreal Alouettes finished 3–13). During the following six seasons, the Roughriders never earned more than six wins in a season, leaving them soundly out of the playoff picture. In 1985, the Roughriders introduced a new logo as part of the 75th anniversary of the inception of the team, adding black and silver to the team&#x27;s colour scheme.

===Kent Austin era (1987–1993)===
Before the 1987 season started, after almost a decade out of the playoffs and poor attendance saddling the team, the Roughriders felt it was necessary to conduct a telethon to keep the team afloat; Roughriders management privately knew the Montreal Alouettes were almost certainly going to fold before the season got underway (Montreal would not return for nearly a decade), and the Riders were determined not to let the same fate befall them. The province-wide &quot;Save the Roughriders&quot; telethon was a success in that the team sold enough tickets to keep the team in operation. Also in 1986, team executive Tom Shepherd founded the group &quot;Friends of the Riders&quot; to run an annual &quot;Touchdown Lottery&quot; to further bolster the club&#x27;s finances. Originally conceived as a one-time fundraiser, it raised almost $22.6 million during its run and operated for 33 years. By the time the lottery was discontinued with Shepherd&#x27;s retirement in 2019, the club&#x27;s financial situation had long been stabilized.

After a carousel of head coaches since John Payne&#x27;s departure in 1977, the Roughriders hired John Gregory after the 1986 season. Gregory took over a team that had missed the playoffs for ten consecutive seasons. In Gregory&#x27;s first season as Saskatchewan&#x27;s head coach, the Roughriders finished 5–12. Gregory then led the Riders to an 11–7 record in 1988 and a playoff berth. He won the Annis Stukus Trophy as the league&#x27;s coach of the year. The 2nd-place finish in 1988 finally ended the franchise&#x27;s 11-year playoff drought, the longest in CFL history. However, the Roughriders had to settle for second place because the Eskimos who had an identical record swept them in the regular season. On November 13, 1988, the Roughriders hosted a playoff game for the first time since 1976, but lost to the BC Lions in the Western Semi-Final by a score of 42–18. Nonetheless, it was a step in the right direction as the Roughriders learned how to win and gained valuable playoff experience that they would need for next season.

====1989 Grey Cup champions====
The Roughriders finished with a 9–9 record and a third-place finish in the 1989 season, but still qualified for the playoffs for a second consecutive season. They defeated the Calgary Stampeders 33–26 in the West Semi-Finals in part because of delay run play to Brian Walling who ran 50 yards for a touchdown to make it 30–26 with 1:38 left to play. Ironically Walling had just been picked up by the Roughriders just weeks previously from the Edmonton Eskimos practice roster. In the West Final, Saskatchewan faced the powerhouse Edmonton Eskimos, a team that set (and still holds) a CFL record with 16 regular season wins in one season since the institution of the 18-game CFL schedule in 1986. The Roughriders defeated the heavily favoured Eskimos 32–21 to advance to the Grey Cup where they faced the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the third time in franchise history. With a talented roster that included Kent Austin at quarterback, receivers Ray Elgaard, Donald Narcisse, Jeff Fairholm and James &quot;Duke&quot; Ellingson, and an outstanding offensive line featuring Roger Aldag, Vic Stevenson, Dan Payne and Bob Poley, the Roughriders found themselves in a game that featured extensive offensive prowess. With the score tied 40–40, placekicker Dave Ridgway kicked a 35-yard game-winning field goal to win the 77th Grey Cup for the Roughriders, with a play that has become simply known as &quot;The Kick.&quot; It was the second championship for the franchise, following a 23-year drought and is considered the greatest Grey Cup game ever played.
Saskatchewan qualified for the playoffs in four of the next five seasons, including two seasons with winning records, but lost in the West Semi-Final each time to either of the two Alberta teams, the Calgary Stampeders or Edmonton Eskimos.

===Struggles and challenges (1994–1999)===
In 1995, Regina hosted the Grey Cup for the first time in league history, giving the Roughriders an opportunity to compete for the championship at home. Unfortunately, the Roughriders finished in sixth place in the newly named North Division, as part of the CFL&#x27;s American expansion, and did not qualify for the playoffs.

With most CFL teams losing money after the ill-fated American expansion ended after the 1995 season, the Roughriders conducted another &quot;Save the Roughriders&quot; telethon in 1997 to help the team&#x27;s financial health, they remain the only professional sports team to organize a telethon on due to a precarious financial situation. As was the case, the telethon along with the then-ongoing Touchdown Lottery helped to keep the franchise afloat again, although the 1997 telethon ended with intrugue after Roughriders management announced that a $500,000 &quot;donation&quot; from a mysterious benefactor had helped to put the team&#x27;s fundraising effort over the top. It was only after weeks of speculation that the club was able to confirm that the funds were in fact the Roughriders&#x27; share of a US$3 million interest-free loan from none other than the National Football League. Roughriders management subsequently explained that loan, equal to roughly C$4 million or $500,000 for each of the then-eight CFL teams at contemporary exchange rates, had been agreed between the leagues in principle but not finalized in time for the telethon, and thus had to remain confidential until formally announced by the respective commissioners.

The Roughriders qualified again for the playoffs that same year for the first time since 1994, when they did so with a losing record, which was a first for the team since 1948. The team made the most of their opportunity as they defeated both of the Alberta-based teams, the Stampeders and Eskimos in the West Semi-Final and West Final, respectively, to advance to the 85th Grey Cup. Unfortunately, the upstart Roughriders fell to the Doug Flutie-led Toronto Argonauts 47–23 in the first ever Grey Cup match-up between the two oldest franchises in the league. The Roughriders closed out the 20th century with two more losing seasons, failing to qualify for the playoffs in both 1998 and 1999.

===Roy Shivers and Danny Barrett era (1999–2006)===

Following the 1999 season, Roy Shivers, the former Director of Player Personnel for the Calgary Stampeders, assumed the duties of general manager of the Roughriders. Shivers then hired Danny Barrett as the team&#x27;s head coach despite the latter&#x27;s limited coaching experience. The Roughriders made football history by being the first professional team with both a black general manager and head coach.

In what was described as a rebuilding process, the Roughriders began the Shivers and Barrett era with two consecutive last place finishes in 2000 and 2001, missing the playoffs in both years. In 2002, progress was being made as Saskatchewan made the playoffs for the first time since their 1997 Grey Cup run with an 8–10 record and a fourth-place finish. The team played in the East Semi-Final due to the crossover rule instituted in 1997, playing in the eastern playoffs for the first time in their 90-year history, losing to their last playoff opponent, the Toronto Argonauts. The 2003 season saw the Roughriders earn their first winning record since 1994, finishing 11–7 and in third place, building optimism in a year where the franchise was hosting their second ever Grey Cup game. While the team played their longtime rival, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, in the playoffs for the first time since 1975 and won, they lost the West Final to the eventual champion Edmonton Eskimos, missing a close chance to play in the Grey Cup at home.

After their strong 2003 campaign, the Roughriders were expected to build upon that success in 2004. While the team regressed slightly with a 9–9 record, they won the West Semi-Final over the Eskimos and advanced to the West Final for the second consecutive year to face the BC Lions. After Saskatchewan scored a late touchdown to take the lead, BC tied the game with a late field goal, sending the game to overtime. Saskatchewan placekicker Paul McCallum missed an 18-yard field goal while BC kicker Duncan O&#x27;Mahoney hit a 40-yarder to win the game for the Lions, adding to the frustration of the Roughrider fanbase.

Prior to the 2005 season, quarterback Henry Burris signed as a free agent with Calgary, leaving the Roughriders with a smaller chance at progress. The team finished in fourth place with a 9–9 record and crossed over to the Eastern playoffs again, only to be defeated by the Montreal Alouettes in the first ever post-season meeting with that team. Feeling a greater need for progress, the pressure was on the Roughriders to perform in 2006 season. After Saskatchewan started the season with a 4–5 record, general manager Roy Shivers was fired on August 21, 2006. The Roughriders then hired Eric Tillman to take over and he elected not to renew Danny Barrett&#x27;s contract at the end of the season, following a third consecutive 9–9 season and a West Final loss to the Lions. While they did not win any championships, Shivers and Barrett restored a measure of respectability to the franchise and set the stage for things to come.

===Ken Miller and Darian Durant era (2007–2011)===
====2007 Grey Cup champions====
 After contending on and off in the early part of the 21st century, the Roughriders hired 1989 Grey Cup hero Kent Austin as head coach and Ken Miller as offensive coordinator in the 2007 season. Despite a rookie head coach, the team jumped out to a 7–2 start, which was their best start since 1976. They finished the season with a 12–6 record and brought along with it the Roughriders&#x27; first home playoff game since 1988, which became a 26–24 victory over the Calgary Stampeders. This was also their first home playoff win since 1976. The team then followed up with a 26–17 win at BC Place over the BC Lions in the West Division final to give the Roughriders a berth in their first Grey Cup final since 1997.

On November 25, 2007, the Riders played the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 95th Grey Cup. The Riders&#x27; traditional rivals had moved to the East Division the previous year following the demise of the Ottawa Renegades, and the 2007 championship game marked the first time that the two Labour Day Classic opponents played each other in a Grey Cup game. Saskatchewan won 23–19 in a game where James Johnson recorded a Grey Cup record three interceptions en route to being named Most Valuable Player of the 2007 Grey Cup. Fellow Roughrider Andy Fantuz was named the Canadian MVP in the game after recording 70 yards receiving and the game-winning touchdown.

A month and a half after capturing the 2007 Grey Cup, Austin stepped down as head coach to become the offensive co-ordinator at his alma mater University of Mississippi. In accepting this position in the NCAA, Austin turned down a very lucrative contract that the Riders had offered. On February 6, 2008, Roughriders GM Eric Tillman announced that the new head coach would be Ken Miller. Miller was formerly the offensive coordinator under Austin. The team also traded former league MVP Kerry Joseph to the Toronto Argonauts, leaving the team without their Grey Cup-winning head coach and starting quarterback.

The 2008 season began with a 6–0 record with wins shared between three quarterbacks, including the season opening starter, Marcus Crandell. This was the team&#x27;s best record since 1934, when they were still known as the Regina Roughriders. On August 24, 2008, the team&#x27;s General Manager, Eric Tillman, announced the acquisition of Quarterback Michael Bishop, the Toronto Argonauts backup quarterback at the time of the trade, who went 11–1 as a starter for the Argonauts in 2007. This was the end of Marcus Crandell&#x27;s run with the Roughriders, as he was released four days later. After the 6–0 start, the Riders went on to finish the 2008 CFL Regular season with the same record they finished with in 2007, at 12–6. The Roughriders finished in second place in the CFL West Division and earned the right to host the CFL West Division Semi-Final for the second consecutive year. The Roughriders suffered a devastating 33–12 loss to the BC Lions in the western semi-final game, leading to Bishop&#x27;s release shortly after the loss.

In 2009, the Roughriders were led by quarterback Darian Durant, who had seen his first significant playing time in 2008 and was named the opening day starter. Durant started all 18 games for Saskatchewan and led the team to a 10–7–1 record and their first West Division regular season title since 1976. After defeating the Calgary Stampeders in the West Final, the team advanced to the 97th Grey Cup to face the Montreal Alouettes. After the Roughriders were leading 27–11 in the fourth quarter, Montreal stormed back to make the score 27–25 late in the fourth. Montreal kicker Damon Duval attempted a 43-yard field goal and missed, but Saskatchewan had been called for a too-many-men penalty, advancing the placement 10 yards. Duval did not miss a second time, scoring the three points to win the game 28–27 for the Alouettes and adding to the Roughriders&#x27; championship woes.

The Roughriders celebrated their 100-year anniversary as a football club during the 2010 season, wearing retro-themed red and black uniforms based on the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders. The Roughriders finished second in the West with a 10–8 record and defeated the BC Lions in double overtime in the West Division Semi-Final. After defeating the Stampeders in the West Final for the second year in a row, the Roughriders faced the Alouettes in the 98th Grey Cup once again. Despite leading 11–8 at the half, the Roughriders faced a ten-point deficit in the fourth quarter. The lead proved insurmountable, as Saskatchewan lost the game to Montreal for the second consecutive year by a score 21–18.

Following the Grey Cup loss, head coach Ken Miller resigned and became Vice President of Football operations. The club hired Greg Marshall as his replacement, but the 2011 season was one to forget, as the Roughriders finished last in the West with a 5–13 record and missed the playoffs. The Roughriders fired Marshall after a 1–7 start and had Miller step in as his replacement. The season was plagued by errors and mishaps, most of them self-inflicted as the team could not dig itself out of their early season hole. 2011 proved to be Ken Miller&#x27;s last season with the Roughriders, as he retired shortly after the 2011 season.

===Corey Chamblin era (2012–2015)===
====2013 Grey Cup champions====

On December 16, 2011 Corey Chamblin, who had been the defensive coordinator for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, was named the new head coach of the Roughriders. The Roughriders signed two of the top Canadian players available in free agency in non-import offensive linemen Brendon LaBatte and Dominic Picard. However, they were not so fortunate with all-star linebacker Jerrell Freeman, who led the league in tackles in 2011 and departed for the NFL. The Roughriders also lost outstanding Canadian slotback Andy Fantuz, who led the league in receiving yards in 2010, as he signed as a free agent with Hamilton. Nonetheless, the team qualified for the playoffs after missing out during the previous season. In 2012, Saskatchewan lost the Western Division Semi-Final game to the Calgary Stampeders in a close game, 36–30.

On January 24, 2013, the Riders traded Justin Harper and a 4th round 2014 pick to the BC Lions for six-time all-star Geroy Simon. Simon holds the record for most career receiving yards. Simon played for the Lions from 2001 to 2012. The 2013 season started off spectacularly for the Roughriders, mainly for Darian Durant and Kory Sheets. The Roughriders went 8–1 in the first nine games and set a record for the best start in franchise history (their previous best was 7–1 during the 1970 season). Running back Kory Sheets had the best start for a running back in CFL history and Darian Durant had thrown only one interception while throwing 21 touchdowns.

The 2013 season ended with an 11–7 record, for 2nd in the West Division, behind Calgary. The team hosted its first playoff game since 2010 on November 10, the West Semi Finals against the BC Lions. The Roughriders won the game, 29–25, the first playoff win of Corey Chamblin&#x27;s CFL head coaching career and the first since 2010 for the Roughriders, when quarterback Darian Durant put the team on his shoulders and rushed for 41 yards. On Sunday, November 17, 2013, the Roughriders successfully defeated the Calgary Stampeders in the Western Finals, the score being 35–13. This allowed the Saskatchewan Roughriders to advance to the 101st Grey Cup. It was the first time in Saskatchewan Roughriders history that they were part of the Grey Cup in their own hometown. In defiance of the individual player introduction format the league had planned for the Grey Cup game, the Roughriders took to the field as a team as the Saskatchewan crowd chanted &quot;bring &#x27;em out,&quot; their usual home game entrance song. The Roughriders defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 45–23, with RB Kory Sheets winning the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player Award after rushing for a franchise and Grey Cup record 197 yards, to be the third consecutive team to win the championship at their home field. The following offseason was a difficult one for the Roughriders, as they lost top players Kory Sheets and Weston Dressler to the NFL and key leaders Mike McCullough, Renauld Williams and Geroy Simon to retirement. The expansion draft saw them give up Canadian players in Keith Shologan and Zach Evans.

In February 2014, the Roughriders traded backup quarterback Drew Willy to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Roughriders gave head coach Corey Chamblin an extension through 2017 after Chamblin won Coach of The Year in the CFL. 2014 training camp found starters in Anthony Allen and Brett Swain as the Roughriders went out to attempt the first repeat championship season in franchise history. They began the 2014 season with a record of 9–3, similar to that of the 2013 season start. The Roughriders defensive line led by John Chick, Ricky Foley and Terrious George led the league in sacks throughout the season, and Brian Peters led a defence poised to make a run at another championship. On September 7, 2014, Darian Durant sustained an elbow injury during the Banjo Bowl that required surgery, ultimately ending his 2014 campaign. The Roughriders then gave backup Tino Sunseri a shot at starting quarterback. With Tino Sunseri leading the team, the Roughriders went 1–4 and Seth Doege got a shot as well. The Roughriders then brought 2007 Most Outstanding Player Kerry Joseph out of retirement to help the struggling team. Joseph, alongside new running back Jerome Messam and receiver Korey Williams won one game before losing to the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western Semi Final.

The 2015 offseason saw the Roughriders lose top defensive players in Brian Peters and Ricky Foley. Peters was signed by the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL and Foley was traded to Toronto for Canadian linebacker Shea Emry on January 24, 2015. Soon after, Weston Dressler was signed to a 4-year contract with the Roughriders and Tyron Brackenridge also signed a contract to stay in Saskatchewan. Free agency saw the Roughriders bring back Kevin Glenn as their backup quarterback. They also brought back veterans Alex Hall, Keenan MacDougall and Jamel Richardson. The 2015 CFL Draft saw them pick receiver Nic Demski from the University of Manitoba Bisons. To begin the year, the Roughriders found a linebacker, Jeff Knox Jr, in training camp and he became an immediate starter next to Shea Emry and Weldon Brown. The first game of the 2015 season was devastating, with the Roughriders losing quarterback Darian Durant once again to a season-ending injury, along with injuries to Shea Emry and Keenan MacDougall early in the season. This led to players such as Jake Doughty getting a starting gig with the team.

With the injury to Durant, Kevin Glenn became the starting quarterback, fulfilling the purpose for which he was signed by Saskatchewan. Days later, Chris Milo was released by the Roughriders, and they brought in veteran Paul McCallum as starting kicker. McCallum first game back with the Green and White was on July 5, 2015, a 42–40 overtime loss to the Toronto Argonauts. Weeks later, the Roughriders still did not have a win in the 2015 season, raising concern on whether head coach Corey Chamblin would eventually be fired. The injury bug around Saskatchewan got worse as quarterback Kevin Glenn, receiver Chris Getzlaf, linebacker Weldon Brown, and receiver Taj Smith were lost to injury. This eventually led to rookie quarterback Brett Smith getting a shot as the starter. During the August 30, 2015 game against the Ottawa Redblacks, head coach Corey Chamblin made the decision to bench Smith in favour of Tino Sunseri following an interception, which disgusted many Roughrider fans. Following another disappointing loss to Ottawa and a record of 0–9 for the first half of the season, head coach Corey Chamblin and general manager Brendan Taman were fired on September 1, 2015. Special teams coordinator Bob Dyce was appointed interim head coach and assistant general manager Jeremy O&#x27;Day was appointed interim general manager.

===Chris Jones era (2016–2018)===
On December 7, 2015, a mere week after winning the 103rd Grey Cup with the Edmonton Eskimos as their head coach, it was announced that Chris Jones would be the new head coach, general manager and vice-president of football operations for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Jones has won four Grey Cups rings with four teams: Montreal 2002, Calgary 2008, Toronto 2012, Edmonton 2015. On December 16, 2015, eight assistant coaches under Jones in Edmonton joined the Roughrider coaching staff. This is includes Stephen McAdoo as Offensive co-ordinator and assistant head coach, Craig Dickenson as Special teams co-ordinator, Jarious Jackson as Quarterbacks coach and passing game co-ordinator, Mike Scheper as Offensive line coach, Phillip Lolley as Linebackers coach, Jason Shivers as Defensive backs coach, Ed Philion as Defensive line coach and Craig Davoren as Running backs coach and special teams assistant.

Jones&#x27; first major moves as head coach and general manager of the Roughriders occurred on December 15, when Jones cut 19 players from the roster including Tyron Brackenridge, Anthony Allen and Terrell Maze. On January 14, 2016, Jones continued the rebuild by cutting fan favourites and long-time Roughriders John Chick and Weston Dressler. Chick went on to sign with the Hamilton Tiger Cats, while Dressler went on to sign with rival Winnipeg Blue Bombers. However, the Roughriders suddenly signed defensive end Shawn Lemon to replace Chick soon after. Later that month, the Roughriders re-signed longtime receiver Rob Bagg. Jones departed after the 2018 season, being succeeded by Craig Dickenson on January 25, 2019.

===Craig Dickenson&#x27;s Riders (2019–2023)===
The Green Riders clinched their first first-place West Division finish since 2009 with a 13–5 record, in Craig Dickenson&#x27;s first year at the coaching helm. However, the team lost in a hard-fought heartbreaker in the West Final game over the arch-rival (and eventual Grey Cup champion) Blue Bombers, 20–13. After the 2020 CFL season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Riders returned to the playoffs in 2021, finishing in second place at 9–5 in the shortened season, defeating the Calgary Stampeders in the West Semi-Final, but losing to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers again (who would win their second straight Grey Cup championship) in the West Final for the second straight season.

In 2022, the Riders missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, posting a 6–12 mark, good for fourth place in the West. The season was much more successful off the field as the franchise again became profitable. This, combined with the team&#x27;s share of revenues from the 2022 Grey Cup (held at Mosaic Stadium as a replacement for the cancelled 2020 championship game) allowed the club to replenish its stabilization fund back to pre-pandemic levels.

Following the season, the Riders replaced both offensive coordinator Jason Maas and quarterback Cody Fajardo, but the end result was the same in the 2023 season as the year previous. The green and white posted the exact same record as the previous year at 6-12, missing the playoffs after ending the season on a seven-game losing streak. The team&#x27;s replacement for Fajardo, veteran CFL quarterback Trevor Harris, was injured early in the season, creating a quarterback controversy where both Mason Fine and Jake Dolegala took turns as the starter.

On October 23, 2023, the Riders announced the organization would not renew its contract with Dickenson, ending his time as head coach. The team did sign Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager Jeremy O&#x27;Day to a three-year extension.

===Corey Mace takes over (since 2023)===

The Riders announced Corey Mace would become the team&#x27;s 48th head coach on November 30, 2023. Mace left the Toronto Argonauts organization after two seasons as defensive coordinator to take on the role, his first as a head coach.

Among Mace&#x27;s first moves as head coach was hiring Regina product Marc Mueller as offensive coordinator, someone Mace had previously coached with in Calgary. It was also announced that Kent Maugeri would stay on as special teams coordinator for his ninth overall season with the team.

In early 2024, the Riders announced Mace would also serve as the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator in addition to his head coaching duties.

During Mace&#x27;s first season at the helm in 2024, the Riders opened the season on a hot start before falling into a summer slump that included the club&#x27;s first tie game since 2009. The team was able to rally later in the season, finishing the regular season with a record of 9-8-1. It was enough to make the playoffs for the first time since 2021, although the team fell short of a Grey Cup appearance.

==Popularity==
===Fan support===
In 2009, the team was described as having the largest fan base in the CFL. The team is third behind the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs for merchandise sales of Canadian sports teams, According to a survey (July 2015), the Riders were considered the third strongest sports Brand in Canada. When the Roughriders play on the road, there is always a strong contingent of fans due to fans travelling and also because of people having relocated from Saskatchewan to other parts of Canada. The Roughriders home attendance record came in 1995 in a win over the Calgary Stampeders as 55,438 (more than 25% of Regina&#x27;s population) fans watched on. This crowd was attainable that year because of the increased capacity of Taylor Field in preparation of hosting the Grey Cup. Rider fans are also known for dressing up in unique and often bizarre Rider-themed costumes, the most popular being the watermelon helmet. They are the only CFL football team with a fan-based analytic website, dedicated to fan-based opinion and perception. Beginning with the 2011 season, Insightrix Research Inc. has conducted a poll after each Roughrider game, surveying a random selection of fans from the SaskWatch Research online community. Each week, fans weigh in on the Riders&#x27; game performance and predictions for the rest of the season. These predictions are compared against other Regions in Saskatchewan, titled &quot;Battle of the Regions.&quot;

=== Fundraisers ===
Fans supported the team through the Friends of the Riders Touchdown Lottery. From 1986 to 2018, the Lottery raised over $23 million for the Saskatchewan Roughriders, while giving out more than $33 million in prizes. During difficult financial times, lottery revenues were crucial to the team&#x27;s survival. In 1987 and 1997, fans responded when the Roughriders held season-ticket telethons to try and raise money to help the team avoid bankruptcy.

===Section 28===
Section 28 (formerly known as the University Section) was a notorious section in the East Side bleachers at Taylor Field. They were known for their strict allegiance to the Riders, standing through the entire game, and often being merciless to opposing fans who sit in the section and cheer for the road team. The University Section got its nickname from the section&#x27;s main purpose in the 1980s and 1990s and was a discount section offered to university students in Saskatchewan. The section later ceased to be a university section but remained a section with a rowdy reputation until Taylor Field&#x27;s closure in 2016.

==Fight and theme songs==
The official Rider songs are played regularly at the stadium, and include &quot;Rider Pride&quot;, and &quot;Paint the Whole World Green.&quot; Among several &#x27;borrowed songs&#x27; is the team&#x27;s touchdown song and victory march, &quot;Green Is the Colour&quot; (adapted from the original &quot;Blue Is the Colour&quot; written by D. Boone and R. McQueen for the Chelsea Football Club) and &quot;On Roughriders&quot; (adapted from &quot;On Wisconsin&quot;, the fight song for the Wisconsin Badgers). In addition, during every fourth quarter intermission, the P.A. system plays the cult hit &quot;The Last Saskatchewan Pirate&quot; by The Arrogant Worms, and the Riders Cheer Team leads the crowd in a fourth quarter stretch. There are many other songs that have been created over the years to tribute the team as well. Many of these songs have proved so popular in Western Canada that they have become popular culture phenomena. The music selection at Mosaic Stadium mostly consists of mainstream popular music.
&quot;Green Is the Colour&quot; is played after every rider touchdown, followed by Gainer the Gopher being driven around the stadium&#x27;s track and giving high fives to those in the first row.

==Mascots==

The current official Rider mascot is Gainer the Gopher, who made his first appearance in 1977, and was updated in 2019. &quot;Gainer&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Regina&quot;, and the gopher, or more precisely Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel, is a common animal on the Canadian Prairies.

==Radio==
Roughriders radio broadcasts are broadcast throughout the province via &quot;The Co-operators Roughrider Football Network&quot;, fronted by flagship station CKRM in Regina. Affiliates include CFWD-FM in Saskatoon, CJGX in Yorkton, CKBI in Prince Albert, CJNB in North Battleford and CJNS-FM in Meadow Lake. Additionally, CKRM&#x27;s 10,000-watt signal brings Rider games to much of the province during the day.

Notable broadcasters for the Roughriders include Dave Dryburgh from 1940 to 1947, and John Badham from 1959 to 1969, on CKCK/620. Rod Peterson was the Roughriders&#x27; voice on CKRM from 1999 to 2019. He was replaced in 2019 by former TSN anchor Derek Taylor. Prior to the 2022 season, Taylor moved to the Blue Bombers to replace the retiring Bob Irving. For the 2022 season, Michael &quot;Ballsy&quot; Ball—who hosted CKRM&#x27;s pre-game and post-game shows, was play-by-play announcer for the Regina Rams, and co-hosted sister station CFWF-FM&#x27;s morning show—became the new voice of the Roughriders. In 2024, he was replaced by Dave Thomas, a former broadcaster for the Saskatoon Blades (CJWW) and Weyburn Red Wings (CFSL), and previously a pre-game host and sideline reporter for the Riders.

The Stampeders were officially founded in 1945, although there were clubs operating in Calgary since the 1890s.

The Calgary Stampeders have won eight Grey Cups, most recently in 2018, from their appearances in 17 Grey Cup Championship games. They have won 20 Western Division Championships and one Northern Division Championship in the franchise&#x27;s history. The team has a provincial rivalry with the Edmonton Elks, as well as fierce divisional rivalries with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the BC Lions.

==History==

===1891–1940: Football in Calgary===
Prior to the formation of the Stampeders in 1945, football in Calgary can be dated back as early as 1891, when Edmonton defeated Calgary 6–5 in the Alberta Total-point Challenge Series. A team from Edmonton (actually the outlying community of Fort Saskatchewan) had a picture taken of themselves after they defeated a Calgary team (in Calgary,) declaring themselves &quot;Champions of Alberta&quot;; the picture has two dates on it, being taken in either 1893 or 1895.

The Calgary Rugby Foot-ball Club played for the Alberta championship in 1907, became the Calgary Tigers and joined the Calgary Rugby Football Union in 1908 and the Alberta Rugby Football Union in 1911. The ensuing decades saw Calgary based teams come and go; including the Calgary Canucks, the &quot;50th Battalion&quot;, the Tigers again, the Calgary Altomahs, and finally the Calgary Bronks of the Western Interprovincial Football Union. These teams were a dominant force in Alberta football, winning the AFRU championship 15 times over the next 25 years. World War II and 1940 brought a halt to football in Calgary, the final year for the Bronks.

None of these earlier Calgary based teams are part of the Stampeders official history or records.

===1945–1959: The early years and an undefeated season===
The WIFU returned to Calgary on September 29, 1945, with the formation of the Calgary Stampeders. In their first game played on October 20 at Mewata Stadium they beat the Regina Roughriders 12–0 before 4,000 fans in attendance. It was a taste of success to come that decade under the direction of head coach Les Lear and talented stars such as Woody Strode, Paul Rowe, Keith Spaith, Dave Berry, Normie Kwong and Ezzert &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; Anderson.

The year 1948 was perhaps the greatest season in Stamps history, achieving a perfect regular season of 12–0 and capping the year a 2-0-1 record in the playoffs including a Grey Cup victory over the Ottawa Rough Riders at Toronto&#x27;s Varsity Stadium, memorable for the team&#x27;s scoring a touchdown on a &quot;sleeper play&quot;. It was also during that same Grey Cup festival that Calgary fans brought pageantry to the game and made it into a national celebration, featuring pancake breakfasts on the steps of City Hall, starting the Grey Cup parade and even riding a horse in the lobby of the Royal York Hotel.

They returned to the Grey Cup the following year (1949), with a 13–1 record but lost to the Montreal Alouettes 28–15 in the title game. It was 19 years until Calgary once again reached the Grey Cup, losing 24–21 to Ottawa in the 1968 final and not until 1971 when they were crowned champions, defeating the Toronto Argonauts 14–11. The Stampeders, like all the teams playing in the WIFU and IRFU, joined the newly formed Canadian Football League in 1958.

===1960–1971: A New Stadium===

The year 1960 brought the Stampeders a new home, McMahon Stadium. Their first game in their new stadium was on August 15, 1960, a 38–23 loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

From 1968 to 1971, the Stampeders made it to the Grey Cup game three out of those four years (missing in 1969), winning it in 1971.

===1972–1989: Save Our Stamps===

After having some great years at the end of the 1960s which culminated in their 1971 Grey Cup championship, 1972 started a long period of struggles for the Stampeders. In the 18 seasons from 1972 to 1989, the Stampeders made the playoffs only 7 times, and although they reached the Western Final in 1978 and 1979 under Jack Gotta (which were their only two playoff wins and appearances for the rest of the 1970s) losing both times to their provincial rivals in Edmonton, who were in the midst of an unprecedented five-year Grey Cup victory run at the time), the next decade was less than kind to the team. During the 1980s, the Stampeders were the only CFL team that did not win a playoff game (the team made five appearances during the decade, all but one of which came on the road and all resulting in losses in the West Semi-Final).

The Stampeders nearly folded after the 1985 season due to years of declining attendance, financial woes and a poor 3–13 record. However, a successful Save Our Stamps campaign in 1986 resulted in season ticket sales of 22,400, additional funds and stability that translated to improved on-field play which laid the groundwork for both their first playoff win since 1979 in 1990, and back-to-back Grey Cup berths in 1991 and 1992 when they won the title over Winnipeg.

===1990–2002: Wally Buono era===
Wally Buono took over the head coaching duties in 1990 (after having served as an assistant coach for the previous three years). Late in the 1991 season, the team, after being community-owned since its inception, went private when Larry Ryckman purchased the team. The next 13 years were some of the most successful years in Stampeders history. Led by quarterbacks Doug Flutie, Jeff Garcia and Dave Dickenson, receivers Allen Pitts, Terry Vaughn and Dave Sapunjis, and a rock-steady defence led by Western All Stars Alondra Johnson, Stu Laird, and Will Johnson the Stampeders racked up a 153–79–2 record during these years. They reached the Grey Cup six times, winning in 1992, 1998, and 2001, losing in 1991, 1995, and 1999. In 1996, Ryckman was found by the Alberta Securities Commission to have run a stock manipulation scheme, was fined $492,000 and was forced to give up the Stampeders, who were subsequently purchased by Sig Gutsche via a receivership court for $1.6 million on April 3. Gutsche helped rectify the team&#x27;s debts and made the team profitable again. The team finished the 1990s having made the playoffs in every year that decade.

On October 8, 2001, Sig Gutsche sold the team to California businessman Michael Feterik. Unlike previous owners, Feterik was intimately involved in the club&#x27;s football operations. Feterik&#x27;s most notorious move was to give the starting quarterback position to his son Kevin Feterik, angering both fans and Buono. Buono left to join the BC Lions after the 2002 CFL season.

===2003–2007: Coaching carousel===
After Wally Buono departed from the Stampeders, the team went through three different head coaches in three years. Jim Barker succeeded Buono in 2003, but was let go after a 5–13 season, and he was replaced by Matt Dunigan, who fared no better in his lone season in 2004, going 4–14. The coaching carousel ended with Tom Higgins taking over in 2005, who brought the team back to respectability led by Henry Burris at quarterback and Joffrey Reynolds at running back, but lost in three straight years in the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Western semi-final games in that span. During this time, the team lost money, and in January 2005, Feterik sold the team to a group led by Ted Hellard, Doug Mitchell and former Stampeder John Forzani, and the Calgary Flames Limited Partnership, the organization that represents the NHL&#x27;s Calgary Flames.

===2008–2015: Hufnagel years===
In 2008, one-time Stamps QB John Hufnagel took the coaching reins, and the Stampeders ended their playoff victory drought en route to winning the team&#x27;s sixth Grey Cup 22–14 against the Montreal Alouettes. Burris was named the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player with DeAngelis being the top Canadian for their efforts. John Hufnagel had been interviewed by several NFL and college football teams, but is still the team&#x27;s general manager to this day. Hufnagel was also the team&#x27;s head coach until the end of the 2015 season, when he turned over the head coaching duties to former Stampeder and BC Lions star Dave Dickenson.

Between 2009 and 2014, the Stampeders reached the Western Final every year except 2011, when the team lost the semi-final game to the Eskimos in Edmonton, 33–19. The following year, the organization by now known as Calgary Sports and Entertainment became the majority owner of the team; the company previously only had a 5% stake in the team. They were able to reach the Grey Cup game that year only to come up short against the Argonauts, falling by a score of 35–22. Following another defeat in the Western Final in 2013, the Stampeders were once again able to reach the Grey Cup the following year. This time, they came out on top with the franchise&#x27;s seventh championship, defeating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 20–16.

===2016–present: Dave Dickenson at the helm===
After the 2015 season, Hufnagel stepped down from his dual responsibility as head coach and general manager, becoming purely a general manager and handing the coaching reins to former Stamps QB Dave Dickenson. The Stamps continued their success in 2016, winning the West Division again with a 15–2–1 record, but falling to the third-year Ottawa Redblacks in the 104th Grey Cup in overtime.

In 2017, the Stampeders finished 13-4-1 (with the league&#x27;s best record for the season) and made their second straight Grey Cup appearance, but lost to the Toronto Argonauts again, just as they did five years earlier.

In 2018, the Stampeders finished 13-5 and made a third straight Grey Cup appearance, winning the title over the Redblacks 27–16 in Edmonton. Bo Levi Mitchell won Most Outstanding Player at the 2018 CFL Awards as well as the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player. Lemar Durant was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Canadian. The Calgary Stampeders quest for a fourth consecutive Grey Cup appearance came to an abrupt end in 2019, as the team lost a step, finishing second in the West with a 12–6 record, falling to the eventual Grey Cup champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West Semi-Final 35–14.

The CFL went on hiatus in 2020, but returned in 2021, and the Stampeders finished one game back of the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the shortened 2021 season with an 8–6 record. The team met an early playoff exit at the hands of the Riders in the West Semi-Final in an overtime heartbreaker, 33–30. The team reached the playoffs again in 2022 with a 12–6 record, but fell to the second place BC Lions in the West Semi-Final 30–16. On December 12, 2022, it was announced that Dickenson had been named the team&#x27;s new general manager in addition to retaining his head coaching duties.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The first football team in Winnipeg was formed in 1879, named the Winnipeg Rugby Football Club. On June 10, 1930, the Winnipeg Tammany Tigers, who were in financial difficulty, disbanded and merged with some of the other teams in the city to create the new &quot;Winnipeg Rugby Football Club&quot;, known unofficially and simply as the &quot;Winnipegs&quot; or even the shorter &quot;&#x27;Pegs&quot;, adopting the colours green and white. The &quot;Winnipegs&quot; played their first game against St.John&#x27;s Rugby Football Club on June 13, 1930 at Carruthers Park in the North End of the city, losing 7–3. 

In 1932, the &quot;Winnipegs&quot; and St. John&#x27;s joined and adopted blue and gold as their colours. In 1933 they also absorbed the &quot;Garrison Rugby Club&quot; football team. The &quot;Winnipegs&quot; played in the Manitoba Rugby Football Union from 1930 to 1935. Prior to the move to Osborne Stadium in 1935, the team played at Carruthers Park, River Park, and Wesley Park.

===First Grey Cup Victory===
By 1935 Western teams had been to the Grey Cup game 10 times, but they had always gone home empty-handed. The East was much more powerful, outscoring their opponents 236–29 through those ten games. On December 7, 1935, the &quot;Winnipegs&quot; got their first trip, to the 23rd Grey Cup. The game was being held in Hamilton, with the home-town Tigers their opponents. It was a rainy day at Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds, with 6,405 fans in attendance.

Winnipeg was up 5–0 before many fans had even reached their seats. Hamilton player Jack Craig let the opening kickoff bounce to the turf, and a Winnipeg player promptly recovered the ball at the Hamilton 15-yard line. Winnipeg scored quickly on a Bob Fritz pass to Bud Marquardt to get the early lead. After scoring another touchdown on a Greg Kabat catch in the endzone, Winnipeg went into halftime up 12–4. Their lead was soon cut to three points in the second half after Hamilton scored a touchdown of their own, helped by a blocked kick that placed the ball on the Winnipeg 15-yard line.

Then, after a Hamilton rouge, Winnipeg&#x27;s Fritz Hanson caught a punt, and after a few moves and a few missed tackles, was on his way to a 78-yard touchdown return, making the score 18–10. Hamilton forced a safety to bring themselves within six points, but failed to cross the goal-line, getting as far as the Winnipeg four-yard line. The final score was Winnipeg 18, Hamilton 12.

With that, Winnipeg had become the first team from Western Canada to win the Grey Cup.

===Early days of glory===
After the Grey Cup victory in 1935, &quot;The Winnipeg Tribune&quot; sports writer Vince Leah called the team the &quot;Blue Bombers of Western football&quot;. Until then, the team had no official nickname, but they quickly began using &quot;Winnipeg Blue Bombers&quot;. Journalist Jim Coleman wrote that the name came at a time when boxer Joe Louis had international success with his similar nickname, the Brown Bomber.

In 1935, the Blue Bombers, Calgary Bronks, and Regina Roughriders formed the Western Interprovincial Football Union at the highest level of play in Western Canada. Between 1936 and 1949, the Bombers won the right to compete for the Grey Cup in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, 1943, and 1945. Of these appearances, Winnipeg won only twice: in 1939 over the Ottawa Rough Riders, and again in their 1941 rematch.

Jack Jacobs, known as Indian Jack, was a Creek quarterback from Oklahoma. He came to the Bombers in 1950 after a successful career in the United States. He led the Bombers to two Grey Cup appearances, losing both. His exciting style of play and extreme talent increased ticket sales and overall awareness and popularity of the club. The revenue the Bombers were getting from their newfound popularity was enough to convince them to move from the small, outdated Osborne Stadium to the new Winnipeg Stadium (later known as Canad Inns Stadium). Jacobs was so well-liked that fans even referred to the new stadium as &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot;. Jacobs retired in 1954 to become a talent scout for the team.

In 1951, Jack Jacobs became the first professional football quarterback to throw for over 3,000 yards in a season, with 3,248. That year, he was also the first professional football quarterback to throw for at least 30 touchdowns, with 33. The next year he bested that mark with 34.

===Bud Grant era===
Bud Grant joined the team in 1953 after a two-year stint with the Philadelphia Eagles, as one of numerous NFL players lured to Canada during the first part of the decade for then-better salaries. After a four-year career as a receiver (classified only as &quot;offensive end&quot; at the time), he accepted the position of head coach of the Bombers in 1957. Grant went on to coach the team for the next 10 years before becoming the head coach of the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings.

In 1956, Blue Bombers fans named Labatt&#x27;s Pilsener Lager, which had a blue label, Labatt Blue, in honour of their team. In 1958, the Blue Bombers joined the newly formed Canadian Football League, and have competed there since.

During Grant&#x27;s tenure as head coach, the Bombers welcomed the likes of Ken Ploen, Leo Lewis, Farrell Funston, Ernie Pitts, 
Charlie Shepard, and Ed Kotowich to the team. The Bombers competed in six Grey Cup games during Grant&#x27;s tenure, winning four (1958, 1959, 1961, and 1962). In 1961, the Bombers won 21–14 over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the first Grey Cup game to go into overtime. The Bombers and Ticats met again in the 1962 Grey Cup, with the game being postponed with 9:29 left in the fourth quarter due to zero visibility in the famous &quot;Fog Bowl&quot;. The game resumed the next morning, with the Bombers winning 28–27.

During the second half of the 1960s, the Bombers&#x27; domination gave way to lean years, with four seasons of double digits in the loss column. The team bounced back in the early 1970s with the likes of quarterback Don Jonas, running-back Mack Herron, and wide receivers Jim Thorpe and Bob LaRose. The team finished first in the Western Conference in 1972, the first time it had done so since 1962. However, the Bombers came up short in the Western final against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, squandering a 13-point third-quarter lead en route to a heartbreaking 27–24 loss, with Saskatchewan kicker Jack Abendschan scoring on a short field goal attempt on the last play of the game to send the &#x27;Riders to the 1972 Grey Cup against Hamilton. The 1972 season was also the last time the team finished first in the West until the 2021 season. The team struggled for a few more seasons under coaches Jim Spavital and Bud Riley before Ray Jauch was brought in as head coach before the 1978 season. Under Jauch, the Bombers became one of the stronger teams in the West, but usually behind Jauch&#x27;s former team, the powerhouse Edmonton Eskimos coached by Hugh Campbell.

In 1981, wide receiver Eugene Goodlow became the first CFL player to reach the century mark in receptions in a season. Goodlow caught 100 passes for 1,494 yards and 14 touchdowns. That season, the Bombers became one of the first teams to have three receivers with at least 1,000 yards in a season: Goodlow with 1,494, Joe Poplawski with 1,271, and Rick House with 1,102.

===Cal Murphy era===
In 1983, Cal Murphy was hired to be the new head coach of the Blue Bombers. Almost immediately, Murphy set the tone for his career with the Bombers by trading popular QB Dieter Brock at midseason (because of Brock&#x27;s desire to play in the USFL) to Hamilton in exchange for QB Tom Clements. Trading Brock turned out to be a wise decision; Clements led the Bombers to a crushing victory in the 1984 Grey Cup, coincidentally over the Brock-led Tiger-Cats. This was Winnipeg&#x27;s first Grey Cup in 22 years, and also their last win and appearance in the championship game as the Western representative until their victory in the 107th Grey Cup. Murphy was named coach of the year in both 1983 and 1984.

In 1987, Murphy stepped down as head coach to become general manager, and assistant coach Mike Riley (son of former Winnipeg coach Bud Riley) took over head-coaching duties. Then, just prior to the start of the 1987 season, the Montreal Alouettes folded. With the East Division suddenly down to three teams compared to five in the West, the league moved the Blue Bombers (who had been the easternmost team in the West) into the East Division, to balance the league.

Under Riley, the Blue Bombers quickly made an impact in the East, winning Grey Cups over their former division rivals B.C. and Edmonton in 1988 and 1990 respectively, and garnering Riley the coach of the year award in both championship seasons. After Riley left, Darryl Rogers and Urban Bowman each led the team for a season until 1993, when Cal Murphy took over head-coaching duties again. Murphy went on to lead the team to a total of five Grey Cup appearances, winning as a coach in 1984, and as GM in 1988 and 1990. He left the club after the 1996 season, having spent 14 years with the team. Later, he coached the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1999.

Winnipeg played a total of eight consecutive seasons in the East before moving to the newly created North Division in 1995 during the CFL&#x27;s expansion to the United States. When the CFL&#x27;s American experiment ended a year later, and the Alouettes were re-established, the Blue Bombers returned to the re-constituted West Division. This arrangement also lasted only one season, as Winnipeg returned to the East again for the 1997 season after the Ottawa Rough Riders ceased operations.

===Milt Stegall era===
In November 1996, Cal Murphy left the Blue Bombers&#x27; organization after 14 years. This was partly due to a 68–7 playoff thumping by the Edmonton Eskimos, and partly because the team had not had a winning record the previous two years, winning only seven games in 1995, and nine in 1996.

Jeff Reinebold was hired to replace Murphy as the team coach, and despite a huge amount of hype, and championship promises going into the 1997 season, he proved to be one of the least successful head coaches in team history. The Bombers won four games in 1997, and just three in 1998.

The few notable highlights from that era include:
*Milt Stegall became an all-star in 1997, his first full year with the team, and scored what seemed like at least one long touchdown in every game.
*A 43–12 drubbing of the eventual Western Division champion Saskatchewan Roughriders in the 1997 Labour Day Classic
*In a dramatic win over the Roughriders at home in 1998, forgotten backup QB Troy Kopp led the second-half over-20-point comeback. This was the &quot;Guaranteed Win day&quot; that the club had been promoting all week, as well as the first win of the season, in week 11.

The few memorable players on the team during that time included linebacker K.D. Williams, safety Tom Europe, running back/returner Eric Blount, and Milt Stegall.

Milt Stegall joined the Bombers in 1995 after a three-year career returning kicks and seeing spot duty at receiver with the Cincinnati Bengals. He played in the Bombers&#x27; final six games of the 1995 season, racking up 469 receiving yards. In 1997, Stegall set a new league record that still stands today for average gain per reception with 26.5 yards on 61 catches for 1616 yards, including 14 touchdowns. Following a brief return to the NFL, that saw him on the verge of making the New Orleans Saints if not for a serious knee injury at the end of training camp, Stegall remained the team&#x27;s primary receiver.

In 1999, the Bombers acquired Khari Jones from the BC Lions. Together, Stegall and Jones brought the Bombers back to prominence, with Jones being the CFL&#x27;s most outstanding player in 2001, and Stegall getting the honour in 2002. During the 2006 Grey Cup, Khari Jones and Milt Stegall were voted and honoured as the best QB/WR combo in CFL history. Charles Roberts joined them in 2001, a year which the Bombers went to the Grey Cup, which they eventually lost to the Calgary Stampeders. The following season, Winnipeg returned to the West Division following the establishment of the Ottawa Renegades. The team was a powerhouse during this period, being one of the best teams in the league from 2001 until 2003.

Midway through the 2004 season, Jones was traded to the Calgary Stampeders, with backup QB Kevin Glenn taking over the starting duties. Glenn led the team to two mediocre seasons after the trade. Prior to the 2006 season, the Renegades suspended operations and Winnipeg once again returned to the East Division.

With the offensive core of Stegall and Roberts still intact, Glenn led the Bombers back to respectability in 2006. The season included many highlights, but none as exciting at what is simply known as &quot;The Play&quot;. On July 20, 2006, trailing the Edmonton Eskimos on the road 22–19, and facing third and long on their own 10-yard line with 4 seconds left in the game, Milt Stegall caught a 100-yard TD pass from Kevin Glenn as time expired to win the game 25–22. It is considered by many as the greatest play in CFL history. Aided by the &quot;miracle&quot; catch, the Bombers ended up making their first playoff appearance in two years. Despite losing in the first round, optimism going into the 2007 was higher than ever.

The 2007 CFL season was in some ways the year of Milt Stegall: he broke the career CFL touchdown record and fell just short of overtaking the career receiving yards record held by Allen Pitts. The 2007 season was rumoured to be Stegall&#x27;s last, as he was 37 years old and had been contemplating retirement for the previous two seasons.

The 2007 Grey Cup game was played between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the Saskatchewan Roughriders, the first time the two teams met for the championship. Winnipeg was defeated by the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23–19 in the Rogers Centre in Toronto. During the East division final win over the Toronto Argonauts, quarterback Kevin Glenn broke his arm and Winnipeg was left with an inexperienced rookie to take his place for the championship game. Back-up quarterback Ryan Dinwiddie — in his first CFL start — did not fare well and threw one touchdown pass, fumbled once and threw three interceptions to Saskatchewan cornerback James Johnson. Johnson was later declared the game MVP.

One of the picks was shown in the instant replay to have hit the ground before it was caught. Despite his rookie mistakes, Dinwiddie showed promise going into the 2008 season. He was released prior to the 2009 season.

It was announced on January 31, 2008, that Milt Stegall would return for one more year for the 2008 season. He signed a one-year contract for $200,000 on the basis of the fact his wife wanted to have their next child in Winnipeg, and the fact that they were in line to be a contender for the Grey Cup. He took a $50,000 pay cut, and started the season 159 yards away from breaking Allen Pitts&#x27; all-time receiving yards record.

Other returning players who were free agents going into the 2008 season, including star DE Tom Canada, OL&#x27;s Dan Goodspeed, and Matt Sheridan, signed for less money from the Bombers than other teams were prepared to pay them, in hopes of a Grey Cup run in &#x27;08. Tom Canada, in particular, reportedly turned down a much higher contract offer from the Montreal Alouettes, to come back to Winnipeg.

The Bombers made a surprise trade when they sent all-star running back Charles Roberts to B.C. for Joe Smith on September 2, 2008. Then on September 8, 2008, they traded all-star DE Tom Canada to Hamilton for Zeke Moreno. But on September 9, 2008, the trade was cancelled because Canada was injured and could not play for at least 10 weeks. So, since they could not trade Canada, they sent over Corey Mace and a first-round pick for Moreno.

Following the 2008 season in which the Bombers were defeated in the division semifinals, Doug Berry (the head coach) was fired. Mike Kelly was chosen to replace him. At the end of the Cal Murphy era, Mike Kelly was the offensive coordinator and was passed over for the top job in favour of Jeff Reinebold. With Milt Stegall&#x27;s early-season knee surgery and drop in production, it was once again speculated that Milt Stegall would retire.

The departure of Brendan Taman on January 13, 2009, was another sign that this era was coming to an end and a new one was beginning. On February 18, 2009, Milt Stegall did retire from the CFL which formally ended the Milt Stegall era.

===The Revolving Door era===
The return of Mike Kelly opened a new Cal Murphy era, and the board hoped to bring back Murphy&#x27;s success. However, Kelly was fired by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Board of Directors on December 17, 2009, after one year of employment.

Paul LaPolice was introduced as the 28th head coach in Blue Bombers history on February 5, 2010. The new coach emphasized the idea of &quot;team&quot; and playing for the uniform. He also made it a point to talk about fixing problems rather than making excuses. The new paradigm was tested in the 2010 season in which the team finished 4–14 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. Nine of those games were lost by four points or fewer, while 10 were lost by a touchdown or less.

The 2011 season featured an almost completely unchanged team (save for a few losses to the NFL and a few gains from the draft). The Blue Bombers reversed their standings from last place in the east in 2010 to finishing in first place in the East division with a 10–8 record. The team success hinged on a league-leading defence dubbed Swaggerville, which led them to their first division title in 10 years. The team advanced to the 99th Grey Cup after defeating Hamilton in the Eastern Final. However, they lost to the favoured BC Lions by a score of 34–23.

On August 9, 2013, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers announced that CEO Garth Buchko stepped down and General Manager Joe Mack was fired.

The CFL returned to Ottawa in 2014 with the establishment of the Redblacks. Initially, the league planned to keep Winnipeg in the East, at least for the short term, due in part to the ongoing competitive dominance of the West. Despite this, Blue Bombers management lobbied heavily to return to the West Division immediately (for historical reasons), and eventually the league relented. The Blue Bombers finished last place in their first season back in the West, with a 7–11 record.

===O&#x27;Shea and the end of the drought===

After being named the acting CEO in August 2013 Wade Miller was announced as the CEO and president of the club on November 12, 2013. The shake-up of the top brass in 2013 also led to Kyle Walters having to take over the acting GM duties, which were made officially his on November 26, when he was named the general manager.

Mike O&#x27;Shea was hired by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on December 4, 2013, to become the team&#x27;s 30th head coach. O&#x27;Shea helped the team return to the playoffs when he made the switch to Matt Nichols as the starting quarterback. The team still failed to advance to a Grey Cup despite the rise in success. During the 2019 season, an injury to Matt Nichols and a suspension to Andrew Harris seemed to end their season. The Bombers traded for Zach Collaros right before the trade deadline, who joined his third team for the year. Collaros formed a quarterback pairing with Chris Streveler. The two quarterbacks&#x27; play, behind the dominant performance of the defence saw the team win their 11th championship at the 107th Grey Cup, breaking a 28-year drought. Hometown player Harris became the first player ever to win the Grey Cup MVP and Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian.

After the CFL cancelled its 2020 season, the league returned in 2021, and the Bombers finished atop the West with an 11–3 record, claiming their first first-place West Division finish since 1972. The team outlasted their arch-rival Saskatchewan Roughriders in the West Final 21–17, setting up a rematch of the 2019 Grey Cup game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Bombers won the 2021 Grey Cup in overtime 33–25, the first back-to-back Grey Cup champions since the Montreal Alouettes won the 97th and 98th Grey Cup, and the first West Division team to win them since the Edmonton Eskimos&#x27; 1978–1982 run of five straight. In 2022, the team finished atop the West again with a 15–3 record, reaching the Grey Cup Final for the third straight season, but the team&#x27;s hopes of a three-peat were dashed on a last-minute blocked field goal at the hands of the Toronto Argonauts, 24–23. They reached the Grey Cup yet again in 2023, winning the West Division with a 14–4 record, but this time, they were upset by the Alouettes courtesy of a touchdown with 13 seconds left in the game to make it 28–24.

==Stadium==

During the Blue Bombers&#x27; early years, the team played at Osborne Stadium, a small stadium near the Manitoba Legislative Buildings. The fast, passing-dominated play of Bombers quarterback Jack Jacobs dramatically increased attendance at games and precipitated the need for a new, larger stadium. Winnipeg Stadium was built in the West End of the city near Polo Park, and the Blue Bombers began play there in 1953. The stadium experienced significant changes throughout its existence, including a renaming to Canad Inns Stadium in 2001.

Over the years, various plans were proposed to relocate the stadium. In 2008, a plan was proposed to build a new stadium at the University of Manitoba, with both private and public funding.
On April 2, 2009, David Asper (a media mogul located out of Winnipeg associated with Canwest and Creswin Properties) struck a deal with all levels of governments to build a new 33,422-seat (expandable to 45,000) stadium at the University of Manitoba in southwest Winnipeg. This would serve as the home for the Blue Bombers, as well as the U of M Bisons. The deal included refurbishing the existing Bison Stadium for practice and training, as well as upgrading, expanding, and building new sports and fitness facilities. This project, once completed, would be the premiere sports training facility in Canada. The project would have received ongoing funding from a retail development that Asper planned to build on the former CanadInns stadium site. As part of the deal, Creswin properties would take over ownership of the team in 2010. The new stadium and facilities would have been completed for the 2012 CFL season, with the retail development finished in 2013. On December 13, 2013, it was reported that Asper and Creswin Properties would no longer be included in the stadium project, which would continue with funding from the City of Winnipeg, Province of Manitoba, and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

On May 2, 2012, the Blue Bombers announced that because of construction delays, the stadium would not be ready until September, thus forcing the team to play four or five home games at Canad Inns Stadium to start the season. In June 2012, it was announced that the stadium would not open until the 2013 season.

The Blue Bombers played their first home game at Princess Auto Stadium (then known as Investor&#x27;s Group Field) on June 27, 2013, losing 38–33 to the Montreal Alouettes.

===Winnipeg Blue Bombers Ring of Honour===
On June 24, 2016, the Blue Bombers unveiled a Ring of Honour at Investors Group Field on the 200 level just above the suites. As sponsored by the Insurance Brokers Association of Manitoba, the club had announced on June 9 that nine players would be selected for the 2016 season for each regular season home game (through online voting along with guidance from the Bomber history and recognition committee), with Chris Walby being the first to be honored. In each season since, Winnipeg has added to the Ring of Honour once a year, which has included several players and one broadcaster.

<text>Ambulatory Patient Group (APG) is a classification system for outpatient services reimbursement developed for the American Medicare service by the Health Care Financing Administration. It classifies patients into nearly 300 pathology groups rather than the 14,000 of the International Classification of Diseases.

The APG system is similar to the diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which apply to inpatient care rendered by a hospital.

<doc id="254204" wikidata="Q17084335" url="?curid=254204" title="Honor system">
<text>An honor system, trust system or honesty system is a way of running a variety of endeavors based on trust, honor, and honesty.

The honor system is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their honor to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms may be operated under the honor system), and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them.

== Examples ==

=== Education ===
The first honor system in America was created at the College of William &amp; Mary in 1779. In some colleges, the honor system is used to administer tests unsupervised. Students are generally asked to sign an honor code statement that says they will not cheat or use unauthorized resources when taking tests. As an example, at Vanderbilt University students taking examinations are required to sign and include the following pledge: “I pledge on my honor that have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this examination”. Any student caught in violation of the Honor Code is referred to the Honor Council which investigates and determines the appropriate action, which can range from failing the course to expulsion from the university. 

At the University of Virginia a student taking an examination is also required to sign a pledge not to give or receive aid and there is one penalty for transgression of the honor code, dismissal from the university. Texas A&amp;M also has an Honor System which states, Aggies do not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do. Any student that does not follow the code is remanded to the Honor council so they can determine the severity of the case and how the student should be punished or if expulsion is necessary. The students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also maintain a student-run honor system. Students maintain the integrity of the university by pledging not to cheat, steal or lie. Unlike the University of Virginia, the honor system at Chapel Hill allows for different sanctions, ranging from probation to expulsion. A single-sanction Honor Code exists at the Virginia Military Institute, where a &quot;drum out&quot; ceremony is still carried out upon a cadet&#x27;s dismissal. 

Some private universities are run by or associated with religious organizations and their honor code reflect that association. At Brigham Young University students commit to the Church Educational System Honor Code which unlike other honor codes has restrictions placed on how students should engage in sexual and romantic relationships and that students and employees should attend religious services.

=== Retail ===

Some supermarket chains allow customers to scan their own groceries with handheld barcode readers while placing them in their own carts (see self-checkout). Customers can be randomly audited. While the system gives customers the ability to place groceries in their bags without paying, participating supermarkets have reported that this experimental system has not increased the amount of shoplifting.

In some countries, farmers leave bags of produce beside the road outside their houses with prices affixed. Passers-by pay by leaving cash in a container. In Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom this is called the honesty box system. In other countries, small unmanned stores are run, where customers are able to enter, obtain what they need, and pay the bill in a secure container.

=== Public health ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people have received their vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance that fully-vaccinated people no longer had to wear face masks. Many places relied on an honor system to trust that people who were not vaccinated continued to wear face masks.

=== Public transport ===
Various public transport systems are ungated and operate on an enforced honour system. Random inspections are made but there is no systematic means of ensuring that everyone has paid. If a Revenue protection inspector finds a person indeed lacks the proper ticket, the passenger gets a Penalty fare.

<doc id="254206" wikidata="Q506126" url="?curid=254206" title="Chimney sweep">
<text>A chimney sweep is a person who inspects then clears soot and creosote from chimneys. The chimney uses the pressure difference caused by a hot column of gas to create a draught and draw air over the hot coals or wood enabling continued combustion. Chimneys may be straight or contain many changes of direction. During normal operation, a layer of creosote builds up on the inside of the chimney, restricting the flow. The creosote can also catch fire, setting the chimney (and potentially the entire building) alight. The chimney must be swept to remove the soot.

In Great Britain, master sweeps took apprentices, typically workhouse or orphan boys, and trained them to climb chimneys. In the German States, master sweeps belonged to trade guilds and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France, climbing boys were used.

The occupation requires some dexterity, and carries health risks.

==History==
The Tudors in England had established the risk of chimneys and an ordinance was created in 1582 both controlling materials (brick and stone rather than plastered timber) and requiring chimneys to be swept four times per year to prevent the build-up of soot (which is highly flammable). Any chimney fire could result in the owner being fined 3 shillings and 4 pence.

With the increased urban population that came with the age of industrialisation, the number of houses with chimneys grew apace and the services of the chimney sweep became much sought-after.

Buildings were higher than before and the new chimneys&#x27; tops were grouped together. The routes of flues from individual grates could involve two or more right angles and horizontal angled and vertical sections. The flues were made narrow to create a better draught, 14in by 9in (36 × 23 cm) being a common standard. Buckingham Palace had one flue with 15 angles, with the flue narrowing to 9in by 9in (23 × 23 cm). Chimney sweeping was one of the more difficult, hazardous, and low-paying occupations of the era, and consequently has been derided in verse, ballad, and pantomime.

The first mechanical sweeper was invented by George Smart in 1803 but was resisted in the UK and the US. Joseph Glass marketed an improved sweeping machine in 1828; he is credited with being the inventor of the modern chimney sweep&#x27;s brush. In the northern US, whites gave up the trade and employed black sweep-boys from the South. After regulation finally took hold in 1875 in the UK and the turn of the century in the US, the occupation became romanticized in popular media.

==Great Britain==

Boys as young as four climbed hot flues that could be as narrow as 81 square inches (9 × 9 inches or 23 × 23 cm). Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. As soot is carcinogenic, and as the boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed, they were prone to chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma. From 1775 onward, there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and Acts of Parliament were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage. Lord Shaftesbury, the philanthropist, led the later campaign.

Chimneys started to appear in Britain around 1200 (with the oldest extant example of a chimney in Britain being in the keep of Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, dating from 1185 AD), when they replaced the open fire burning in the middle of the one room house. At first there would be one heated room in the building and chimneys would be large. Over the next four hundred years, rooms became specialized and smaller and many were heated. Sea coal started to replace wood, and it deposited a layer of flammable creosote in the inside surface of the flue, and caked it with soot. Whereas before, the chimney was a vent for the smoke, now the plume of hot gas was used to suck air into the fire, and this required narrower flues. Even so, boys rarely climbed chimneys before the Great Fire of London, when building regulations were put in place and the design of chimneys was altered. The new chimneys were often angular and narrow, and the usual dimension of the flue in domestic properties was by . The master sweep was unable to climb into such small spaces himself and employed climbing boys to go up the chimneys to dislodge the soot. The boys often &#x27;buffed it&#x27;, that is, climbed naked, propelling themselves by their knees and elbows which were scraped raw. They were often put up hot chimneys, and sometimes up chimneys that were alight in order to extinguish the fire. Chimneys with sharp angles posed a particular hazard. These boys were apprenticed to the sweep, and from 1778 until 1875 a series of laws attempted to regulate their working conditions, and many firsthand accounts were documented and published in parliamentary reports. From about 1803, there was an alternative method of brushing chimneys, but sweeps and their clients resisted the change, preferring climbing boys to the new humane sweeping machines. Compulsory education was established in 1870 by the Elementary Education Act 1870 but it was a further five years before legislation was put in place to license chimney sweeps and finally prevent boys being sent up chimneys.

===Climbing boys===

The climbing boys, and sometimes girls, were technically called &quot;chimney sweeps&#x27; apprentices&quot;, and were apprenticed to a &quot;master sweep&quot;, who, being an adult, was too large to fit into a chimney or flue. He would be paid by the parish to teach orphans or paupers the craft. They were totally reliant on him: they or their guardians had signed papers of indenture, in front of a magistrate, which bound them to him until they were adults. It was the duty of the Poor Law guardians to apprentice as many children of the workhouse in their care as possible, so as to reduce costs to the parish. The master sweep had duties: to teach the craft and its mysteries, to provide the apprentice with a second suit of clothes, to have him cleaned once a week, allow him to attend church, and not send him up chimneys that were on fire. An apprentice agreed to obey his master. Once his seven-year-long apprenticeship was completed he would become a journeyman sweep, and would continue to work for a master sweep of his choice. Other apprentices were sold on to the sweep, or sold by their parents. Prices ranged from 7 shillings to 4 guineas.

It was generally agreed that six was a good age to train a boy. Though Lord Shaftesbury once encountered one of the age of four, they were considered to be too weak. A master sweep would have many apprentices, who would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out &quot;Soot -Oh, Sweep&quot; or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around; this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the fireplace, and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in. He would pull his cap down over his face and hold a large flat brush over his head, and wedge his body diagonally in the flue. Using his back, elbows, and knees, he would shimmy up the flue in the manner of a caterpillar and use the brush to dislodge loose soot, which would fall over him and down to the bottom, and a scraper to chip away the solid bits, as a smooth chimney was a safe chimney. Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep&#x27;s cart or yard.

Soot was valuable and could be sold for 9d a bushel in 1840. An apprentice would do four or five chimneys a day. When they first started they scraped their knees and elbows, so the master would harden up their skin by standing them close to a hot fire and rubbing in strong brine using a brush. This was done each evening until the skin hardened. The boys got no wages but lived with the master, who fed them. They slept together on the floor or in the cellar under the sacks and the cloth used during the day to catch the soot. This was known as &quot;sleeping black&quot;. The boy would be washed by the mistress in a tub in the yard; this might happen as often as once a week, but rarely. One sweep used to wash down his boys in the Serpentine. Another Nottingham sweep insisted they washed three times a year, for Christmas, Whitsun, and the Goose Fair. Sometimes, a boy would need to be persuaded to climb faster or higher up the chimney, and the master sweep would light either a small fire of straw or a brimstone candle, to encourage him to try harder. One method to stop him from &quot;going off&quot; (asphyxiating) was to send another boy up behind him to prick pins into his buttocks or the soles of his feet.

Chimneys varied in size. The common flue was designed to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though they often narrowed to one brick square, that is by or less. Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, and occasionally it would actually be on fire. Climbing boys risked getting stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive, the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks from the side of the chimney. If the chimney was particularly narrow the boys would be told to &quot;buff it&quot;, that is to do it naked; otherwise they just wore trousers and a shirt made from thick rough cotton cloth.

===Health and safety concerns===
The conditions to which these children were subjected caused concern and societies were set up to promote mechanical means for sweeping chimneys and it is through their pamphlets that we have a better idea of what the job could entail. Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:

After passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner&#x27;s Jury returns a verdict of &quot;Accidental Death&quot;.
These however were not the only occupational hazards that chimney sweeps suffered. In the 1817 report to Parliament, witnesses reported that climbing boys suffered from general neglect, and exhibited stunted growth and deformity of the spine, legs, and arms, which were thought to be caused by being required to remain in abnormal positions for long periods of time before their bones had hardened. The knees and ankle joints were the most affected. Sores and inflammation of the eyelids that could lead to loss of sight, were slow in healing because the boy kept rubbing them. Bruises and burns were obvious hazards of having to work in an overheated environment. Cancer of the scrotum was found only in chimney sweeps so was referred to as Chimney Sweep Cancer in the teaching hospitals. Asthma and inflammation of the chest were attributed to the fact that the boys were out in all weathers.

&quot;Chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma&quot;, which the sweeps called soot wart, did not occur until the sweep was in his late teens or twenties. It has now been identified as a manifestation of &quot;scrotal squamous cell carcinoma&quot;. It was reported in 1775 by Sir Percival Pott in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It is the first industrially related cancer to be found. Potts described it:

It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges ... in no great length of time it pervades the skin, dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges [&quot;sic&quot;], hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.
He also comments on the life of the boys:

The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, [&quot;sic&quot;] where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.

The carcinogen was thought to be coal tar, possibly containing some arsenic.

There were many deaths caused by accidents, frequently caused by the boy becoming jammed in the flue of a heated chimney, where he could suffocate or be burned to death. Sometimes a second boy would be sent to help and, on occasions would suffer the same fate.

===Regulation===
In 1788, the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788 (long title: An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices) was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement. It introduced the Apprenticeship Cap badge. The Act had been partially inspired by the interest in climbing boys shown by Jonas Hanway, and his two publications &quot;The State of Chimney Sweepers&#x27; Young Apprentices&quot; (1773) and later &quot;Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster&quot; (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with the abolition of slavery in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to Edinburgh, Scotland, where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself pulling bundles of rags up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys, which did not lead to future employment. Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys&#x27; lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The Lords removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before civil registration, there was no way that anyone could check if a child was actually eight.

In the same year, David Porter, a humane master sweep, sent a petition to Parliament, and in 1792 published &quot;Considerations of the Present State of Chimney Sweepers with some Observations on the Act of Parliament intended for their Relief and Regulation&quot;. Though concerned for the boys&#x27; welfare he believed that boys were more efficient than any of the new mechanical cleaning machines. In 1796 a society was formed for &quot;Bettering the Conditions of the Poor&quot;, and they encouraged the reading of Hanway&#x27;s and Porter&#x27;s tracts. They had influential members and royal patronage from George III. A Friendly Society for the Protection and Education of Chimney-Sweepers&#x27; Boys had been established in 1800.

In 1803, it was thought by some that a mechanical brush could replace a climbing boy (the Human brush), and members of the 1796 society formed &quot;The London Society for Superseding the Necessity for Employing Climbing Boys&quot;; they ascertained that children had now cleaned flues as small as 7in by 7in, and promoted a competition for a mechanical brush. The prize was claimed by George Smart for what, in effect, was a brush head on a long segmented cane, made rigid by an adjustable cord that passed through the canes.

The Chimney Sweepers Act 1834 contained many of the needed regulations. It stated that an apprentice must express himself in front of a magistrate that he was &quot;willing and desirous&quot;. Masters must not take on boys under the age of fourteen. The master could only have six apprentices and an apprentice could not be lent to another master. Boys under fourteen who were already apprenticed must wear brass cap badges on a leather cap. Apprentices were not allowed to climb flues to extinguish fires. Street cries were regulated. The act was resisted by the master sweeps, and the general public believed that property would be at risk if the flues were not cleaned by a climbing boy.

Also that year building regulations relating to the construction of chimneys were changed.

The Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840 made it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to sweep chimneys. It was widely ignored. Attempts were made in 1852 and 1853 to reopen the issue, another enquiry was convened and more evidence was taken. There was no bill. The Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864, c. 37, tightened controls significantly, by authorizing fines and imprisonment for master sweeps who were ignoring the law, giving the police the power of arrest on suspicion and authorizing Board of Trade inspections of new and remodelled chimneys. Lord Shaftesbury was a main proponent of the Act.

In February 1875 a twelve-year-old boy, George Brewster, was sent up the Fulbourn Hospital chimneys by his master, William Wyer. He stuck and smothered. The entire wall had to be pulled down to get him out and although he was still alive, he died shortly afterward. There was a coroner&#x27;s inquest which returned a verdict of manslaughter. Wyer was sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Shaftesbury seized on the incident to press his campaign again. He wrote a series of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; and in September 1875 pushed another bill through Parliament which finally stopped the practice of sending boys up chimneys.

The Chimney Sweepers Act 1875 required chimney sweepers &quot;to be authorized by the police to carry on their businesses in the district&quot;, thus providing the legal means to enforce all previous legislation.

==United States==
The history of sweeping in the United States varies little from that in the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.

Sweeping of the wide flues of these low buildings was often done by the householder himself, using a ladder to pass a wide brush down the chimney. In a narrow flue, a bag of bricks and brushwood would be dropped down the chimney. But in longer flues climbing boys were used, complete with the tradition of coercion and persuasion using burning straw and pins in the feet and the buttocks. Sweeping was not a popular trade. During the eighteenth century the employment of African-American chimney sweeps spread from the south to the north. African-American sweeps faced discrimination and were accused of being inefficient and starting fires. It was claimed that there were fewer fires in London where chimneys were swept by white boys than in New York City. As in the UK, Smart&#x27;s sweeping machine was available in the US shortly after 1803, but few were used. Unlike the UK, there were no societies formed to advocate for the climbing boys. In fact, the contemporary novel &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; went so far as to deny the black slave chimney sweeps&#x27; hardships by claiming that they had it easier than the London chimney sweeps.

==Sweeps&#x27; festivals==
The London boys had one day&#x27;s holiday a year, the first of May (Mayday). They celebrated by parading through the streets, dancing and twisting with Jack in the Green, merging several folk traditions. There is also a Sweeps&#x27; Festival in Santa Maria Maggiore in Italy, and in Rochester in Kent where the tradition was revived in 1980.

==Good luck omen==
*In Great Britain it is considered lucky for a bride to see a chimney sweep on her wedding day. Many modern British sweeps hire themselves out to attend weddings in pursuance of this tradition.
*In Germany, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, and Estonia, chimney sweeps still wear the traditional all-black uniform with a black or white hat. It is considered good luck to rub or grasp one of your buttons if you pass one in the street.
*As a lucky symbol, depictions of chimney sweeps are a popular New Year&#x27;s Day gift in Germany; either as small ornaments attached to flower bouquets or candy, e.g. marzipan chimney sweeps. Their traditional uniform is an all black suit with golden jacket buttons and a black top hat.

==Today==

Today, chimney sweeps are still operating, as venting systems for coal, heating oil, natural gas, and wood- and pellet-burning appliances need to be maintained. There is a greater understanding of the dangers of flue deposits and carbon monoxide and gases from combustion. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuum cleaners, cameras, and special chimney cleaning tools). Most sweeps are done from the bottom of the chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris and because it is safer for the chimney sweep to do the sweeping from this position. Inspection may be done from the bottom or top, or both if accessible. Chimney sweeps often encounter a range of unexpected objects in chimneys ranging from dead birds to tools, notes, love letters, and other pieces of ephemera.

Most modern chimney sweeps are professionals, and are usually trained to diagnose and repair hazards along with maintenance such as removal of flammable creosote, firebox and damper repair, and smoke chamber repair. Some sweeps also offer more complicated repairs such as flue repair and relining, crown repair, and tuckpointing or rebuilding of masonry chimneys and cement crowns.

In the United States, the two trade organizations that help to regulate the industry are the Chimney Safety Institute of America and The National Chimney Sweep Guild. Certification for chimney sweeps are issued by two organizations: Certified Chimney Professionals and The Chimney Safety Institute of America, which was first to establish certification and requires sweeps to re-test every three years or demonstrate the commitment to education by earning CEUs through CSIA or the National Fireplace Institute to bypass the test. Certification for chimney sweeps who reline chimneys are issued by Certified Chimney Professionals and the Chimney Safety Institute of America. CEU credits may be obtained from these organizations and regional associations as well as private trainers.

In the United Kingdom Chimney Sweeping is unregulated however many sweeps have organised themselves into trade associations including the Association of Professional Independent Chimney Sweeps, the Guild of Master Chimney Sweeps, and The National Association of Chimney Sweeps. As well as offering support to members they provide training and representation to DEFRA and other interested parties.

<text>The Data General RDOS (&quot;Real-time Disk Operating System&quot;) is a real-time operating system released in 1970. The software was bundled with the company&#x27;s popular Nova and Eclipse minicomputers.

==Overview==
RDOS is capable of multitasking, with the ability to run up to 32 tasks (similar to the current term threads) simultaneously on each of two grounds (foreground and background) within a 64 KB memory space. Later versions of RDOS are compatible with Data General&#x27;s 16-bit Eclipse minicomputer line.

A cut-down version of RDOS, without real-time background and foreground capability but still capable of running multiple threads and multi-user Data General Business Basic, is called Data General Diskette Operating System (DG-DOS or now—somewhat confusingly—simply DOS); another related operating system is RTOS, a Real-Time Operating System for diskless environments. RDOS on microNOVA-based &quot;Micro Products&quot; micro-minicomputers is sometimes called DG/RDOS.

RDOS was superseded in the early 1980s by Data General&#x27;s AOS family of operating systems, including AOS/VS and MP/AOS (MP/OS on smaller systems).

==Antitrust lawsuit==
In the late 1970s, Data General was sued (under the Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts) by competitors for their practice of bundling RDOS with the Data General Nova or Eclipse minicomputer. When Data General introduced the Data General Nova, a company called Digidyne wanted to use its RDOS operating system on its own hardware clone. Data General refused to license their software and claimed their &quot;bundling rights&quot;. In 1985, courts including the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Data General in a case called &quot;Digidyne v. Data General&quot;. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Data General&#x27;s appeal, although Justices White and Blackmun would have heard it. The precedent set by the lower courts eventually forced Data General to license the operating system because restricting the software to only Data General&#x27;s hardware was an illegal tying arrangement.

In 1999, Data General was taken over by EMC Corporation.

<doc id="254234" wikidata="Q1615742" url="?curid=254234" title="Provinces of China">
<text>Provinces () are the most numerous type of province-level divisions in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). There are currently 22 provinces administered by the PRC and one province that is claimed, but not administered, which is Taiwan, currently administered by the Republic of China (ROC). 

The local governments of Chinese provinces consists of a Provincial People&#x27;s Government headed by a governor that acts as the executive, a Provincial People&#x27;s Congress with legislative powers, and a parallel provincial branch of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that elects a Party Secretary and a Provincial Standing Committee.

== Government ==
Provinces are the most common form of province-level governments. The legislative bodies of the provinces are the Provincial People&#x27;s Congresses. The executive branch is the Provincial People&#x27;s Government, led by a governor. The People&#x27;s Government is answerable to both the State Council and the Provincial People&#x27;s Congress. The provincial branch of the CCP has a Provincial Party Congress every five years, and elects a Standing Committee to exercise its authority when not in session. The Provincial Party Secretary is the &quot;de facto&quot; most important position in the province.

== History ==
The first provinces were created in the Yuan dynasty, and have remained one of the most stable forms of Chinese government since then. They were created to help the Imperial court manage local county governments, which were too numerous and far-flung to be managed directly. The number of provinces grew steadily during subsequent dynasties, reaching 28 by the time of the Republic of China. During the Warlord Era, provinces became largely or completely autonomous and exercised significant national influence. Province-level units proliferated and under the early People&#x27;s Republic there were over 50.
Political boundaries are, in part, established to counterbalance the influence of economic factors. For instance, the Yangtze Delta is divided among the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui. This division ensures that economic strength is distributed, preventing any single region from potentially overpowering the state.

<doc id="254237" wikidata="Q13634063" url="?curid=254237" title="Proof of Bertrand's postulate">
<text>In mathematics, Bertrand&#x27;s postulate (now a theorem) states that, for each formula_1, there is a prime formula_2 such that formula_3 in order to be large enough. This is achieved through analysis of their factorizations.

The main steps of the proof are as follows. First, one shows that the contribution of every prime power factor formula_4 in the prime decomposition of the central binomial coefficient formula_5 is at most formula_6; then, one shows that every prime larger than formula_7 appears at most once.

The next step is to prove that formula_8 has no prime factors in the interval formula_9. As a consequence of these bounds, the contribution to the size of formula_8 coming from the prime factors that are at most formula_11 grows asymptotically as formula_12 for some formula_13. Since the asymptotic growth of the central binomial coefficient is at least formula_14, the conclusion is that, by contradiction and for large enough formula_11, the binomial coefficient must have another prime factor, which can only lie between formula_11 and formula_6.

The argument given is valid for all formula_18. The remaining values of formula_11 are verified by direct inspection, which completes the proof.

==Lemmas in the proof==

The proof uses the following four lemmas to establish facts about the primes present in the central binomial coefficients.

===Lemma 1===
For any integer formula_20, we have
:formula_21

Proof: Applying the binomial theorem,
:formula_22
since formula_8 is the largest term in the sum in the right-hand side, and the sum has formula_6 terms (including the initial formula_25 outside the summation).

===Lemma 2===
For a fixed prime formula_2, define formula_27 to be the &quot;p&quot;-adic order of formula_8, that is, the largest natural number formula_29 such that formula_4 divides formula_8.

For any prime formula_2, formula_33.

Proof: The exponent of formula_2 in formula_35 is given by Legendre&#x27;s formula
:formula_36
so
:formula_37
But each term of the last summation must be either zero (if formula_38) or one (if formula_39), and all terms with formula_40 are zero. Therefore,
:formula_41
and
:formula_42

===Lemma 3=== 
If formula_2 is an odd prime and formula_44, then formula_45

Proof: There are exactly two factors of formula_2 in the numerator of the expression formula_47, coming from the two terms formula_2 and formula_49 in formula_50, and also two factors of formula_2 in the denominator from one copy of the term formula_2 in each of the two factors of formula_35. These factors all cancel, leaving no factors of formula_2 in formula_8. (The bound on formula_2 in the preconditions of the lemma ensures that formula_57 is too large to be a term of the numerator, and the assumption that formula_2 is odd is needed to ensure that formula_49 contributes only one factor of formula_2 to the numerator.)

===Lemma 4===
An upper bound is supplied for the primorial function,
:formula_61
where the product is taken over all &quot;prime&quot; numbers formula_2 less than or equal to formula_11.

For all formula_64, formula_65.

Proof: We use complete induction.

For formula_66 we have formula_67 and formula_68.

Let us assume that the inequality holds for all formula_69. Since formula_70 is composite, we have
:formula_71

Now let us assume that the inequality holds for all formula_72. Since formula_73 is an integer and all the primes formula_74 appear only in the numerator, we have
:formula_75
Therefore,
:formula_76

==Proof of Bertrand&#x27;s Postulate==
Assume that there is a counterexample: an integer &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2 such that there is no prime &quot;p&quot; with &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot;.

If 2 ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; 427, then &quot;p&quot; can be chosen from among the prime numbers 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 43, 83, 163, 317, 631 (each being the largest prime less than twice its predecessor) such that &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot;. Therefore, &quot;n&quot; ≥ 427.

There are no prime factors &quot;p&quot; of formula_77 such that:
* 2&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot;, because every factor must divide (2&quot;n&quot;)!;
* &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot;, because 2&quot;n&quot; is not prime;
* &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot;, because we assumed there is no such prime number;
* 2&quot;n&quot;&amp;hairsp;/&amp;hairsp;3 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;: by Lemma 3.
Therefore, every prime factor &quot;p&quot; satisfies &quot;p&quot; ≤ 2&quot;n&quot;&amp;hairsp;/&amp;hairsp;3.

When formula_78 the number formula_79 has at most one factor of &quot;p&quot;. By Lemma 2, for any prime &quot;p&quot; we have &quot;p&quot;&quot;R&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) ≤ 2&quot;n&quot;, and formula_80 since 1 is neither prime nor composite. Then, starting with Lemma 1 and decomposing the side into its prime factorization, and finally using Lemma 4, these bounds give:
:formula_81
Therefore
:formula_82, which simplifies to formula_83
Taking logarithms yields
:formula_84
By concavity of the right-hand side as a function of &quot;n&quot;, the last inequality is necessarily verified on an interval. Since it holds true for formula_85 and it does not for formula_86, we obtain
:formula_87
But these cases have already been settled, and we conclude that no counterexample to the postulate is possible.

===Addendum to proof===
It is possible to reduce the bound to formula_88.

For formula_89 we get formula_90, so we can say that the product formula_91 is at most formula_92, which gives

:formula_93

which is true for formula_94 and false for formula_88.

<text>Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, named after members Peter Kruder and Richard Dorfmeister, is an Austrian duo, known for their trip hop/downtempo remixes of pop, hip hop and drum and bass songs.

==Career==
In 1993, they released their first EP &quot;G-Stoned&quot; featuring the hypnotic &quot;High Noon&quot; and a cover resembling Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bookends&quot; to critical acclaim especially from the UK. Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his BBC show &quot;Worldwide&quot;.

In 2007, the duo were commissioned by Nokia to create a set of ringtones and sounds for its luxury Nokia 8800 Arte and Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte phones.

2010 marked the 16th anniversary of Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister and their record label G-Stone Recordings which resulted in the release of the &quot;Sixteen F**king Years Of G-Stone Recordings&quot; compilation and the development of the &quot;K&amp;D Sessions Live&quot; show. The show included visuals by longtime G-Stone VJ collaborator Fritz Fitzke and MC performances by Earl Zinger and MC Ras T-Weed. With performances at The Big Chill, Berlin Festival and other large festivals, the &quot;K&amp;D Sessions Live&quot; show became successful and a world tour ensued.

<doc id="254258" wikidata="Q1093303" url="?curid=254258" title="Bossanova (Pixies album)">
<text>Bossanova is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Pixies. It was released on August 13, 1990, by English independent record label 4AD in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Because of 4AD&#x27;s independent status, major label Elektra handled distribution in the USA.

&quot;Bossanova&quot; reached number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album peaked at number three in the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from &quot;Bossanova&quot;; &quot;Velouria&quot; and &quot;Dig for Fire&quot;. Both charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in the USA, at No. 4 and No. 11, respectively.

== Background ==
After Pixies finished touring for their second album, &quot;Doolittle&quot; (1989), in January 1990, band members Black Francis, Joey Santiago, and David Lovering moved from Boston to Los Angeles. Bassist Kim Deal stayed in the UK to record the Breeders&#x27; first album in January with producer Steve Albini, although she ultimately decided to travel out to Los Angeles with the rest of the group. Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved to Los Angeles because that&#x27;s where they intended to record their next album. The three band members lived in the Oakwood apartments, along with comic Garrett Morris and members of the band White Lion. Producer Gil Norton also moved into the apartment complex.

== Recording and production ==
Pixies started recording material for &quot;Bossanova&quot; at Cherokee Studios in February 1990, where the sessions ran into problems. Norton said that nothing could be recorded after 6 p.m. because the recording desk would pick up pirate radio stations. Norton decided to work on overdubs in another studio for a few days until the problem was corrected, but when he returned to Cherokee, he found that any time something was plugged into a guitar amplifier it would generate &quot;this incredible hum&quot;. Norton refused to tell 4AD owner Ivo Watts-Russell about the problem until he felt he could address it. One day while visiting a bar, Norton and Santiago met producer Rick Rubin and informed him of their situation. Rubin had his secretary find another studio for the group, and the band continued recording at Master Control.

== Composition ==
Black Francis wrote one of the songs on the album, &quot;Blown Away&quot;, in Spain in early June 1989 while on tour. The song was recorded with producer Gil Norton, who was specially flown in for the one-song session, at Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin, after their June 19 concert there.

In contrast to previous records, many songs were written in the studio and few demo recordings were created. Santiago said that the band only practiced for a two-week period, in contrast to previous albums, when the band would rehearse constantly in Boston. Black Francis noted, &quot;So I was writing [lyrics] on napkins five minutes before I sang. Sometimes it&#x27;s good, sometimes not. That&#x27;s just the nature of that songwriting.&quot;

== Release ==
The album was released in August 1990 on 4AD in the UK, and jointly by 4AD and Elektra in the USA. After 4AD re-acquired sole distribution rights for Pixies&#x27; back catalog, a re-issued (although not remastered) CD appeared solely on 4AD in the US in 2004. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a version in 2008 that was remastered from the original analog master tapes.

== Critical reception ==
The UK reviews of &quot;Bossanova&quot; were generally positive. In his September 1990 review of &quot;Bossanova&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;″s Mat Snow said that &quot;the Pixies are masters of the calculated incongruity,&quot; and commented that &quot;they give other rockers an object lesson in the first principles of how it should be done.&quot; Terry Staunton of &quot;NME&quot; noted that the album&#x27;s production &quot;leans towards the harsh garage grunge of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, although the songs retain the strong melodies of &quot;Doolittle&quot;,&quot; and said that &quot;&quot;Bossanova&quot; is the composite Pixies LP.&quot;

In comparison to the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Moira McCormick described &quot;Bossanova&quot; as &quot;more of a straight-ahead rock album – by the Pixies&#x27; standards, meaning it&#x27;s still safely off the mainstream.&quot;

UK magazine &quot;Select&quot; made &quot;Bossanova&quot; their album of the year for 1990. The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>An air (; also &quot;air&quot; in French) is a song-like vocal or instrumental composition. The term can also be applied to the interchangeable melodies of folk songs and ballads. It is a variant of the musical song form often referred to (in opera, cantata and oratorio) as aria.

==English lute ayres==
Lute airs were first produced in the royal court of England toward the end of the 16th century and enjoyed considerable popularity until the 1620s. Probably based on Italian monody and French &quot;air de cour&quot;, they were solo songs, occasionally with more (usually three) parts, accompanied on a lute. (p. 306). Their popularity began with the publication of John Dowland&#x27;s (1563–1626) &quot;First Booke of Songs or Ayres&quot; (1597). His most famous airs include &quot;Come again&quot;, &quot;Flow, my tears&quot;, &quot;I saw my Lady weepe&quot;, and &quot;In darkness let me dwell&quot;. The genre was further developed by Thomas Campion (1567–1620) whose &quot;Books of Airs&quot; (1601) (co-written with Philip Rosseter) contains over 100 lute songs and was reprinted four times in the 1610s. Although this printing boom died out in the 1620s, ayres continued to be written and performed and were often incorporated into court masques. (p. 309).

==Baroque and classical airs==

By the 18th century, composers wrote airs for instrumental ensembles without a voice. These were song-like, lyrical pieces, often movements in a larger composition. Johann Sebastian Bach composed two of the best-known airs: the second movement of his Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068, which August Wilhelmj arranged for violin and piano as &quot;Air on the G String&quot;; and the theme of his &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, BWV 988, the Air present also in Partitas BWV 825–830 harpsichord. The fifth movement of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Suite in F Major&quot;, HWV 348, part of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot; collection, is another frequently performed air.

<doc id="254260" wikidata="Q1058919" url="?curid=254260" title="Chahar Province">
<text>Chahar (; ), also known as Chaha&#x27;er, Chakhar or Qahar, was a province of the Republic of China in existence from 1912 to 1936, mostly covering territory in what is part of Eastern Inner Mongolia. It was named after the Chahar Mongols.

== Administration and history ==
Chahar Province is named after the Chahar, a tribal group of the Mongols who live in that area. The area was controlled (in part or fully) by various empires that ruled over China&#x27;s north including the Han, Tang, Liao, and Jin dynasties. After the unification of the Mongol tribes under Genghis Khan, the area came under Yuan rule. After the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), the area was a battleground between the Ming dynasty and Northern Yuan. Then the Chahar tribe became the personal appanage of the monarchs of the Northern Yuan dynasty since the reign of Batumongke Dayan Khan (r. 1479–1517). By the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), Chahar was a &quot;Zhangyuan Special Region&quot; (), although Yao Xiguang () proposed making Chahar a province as early as 1908.

=== Republic of China era ===
In 1913, the second year of the Republic of China, Chahar Special Administrative Region was created as a subdivision of Zhili Province, containing 6 Banners and 11 counties:
In 1928, it became a province. The last five counties on the above list (starting from Xinghe) were partitioned to Suiyuan province. And ten counties were included from Xuanhua Subprefecture (宣化府), Koubei Circuit (口北道), Hebei Province:
All banners belong to the Shilingol League (, 锡林郭勒盟).

From 1937 to 1945, it was occupied by Japan and made a part of Mengjiang, a Japanese-controlled region led by Mongol Prince Demchugdongrub of the Shilingol Alliance. The Chahar People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Army Alliance (察哈爾民眾抗日同盟軍) was established in Kalgan on May 26, 1933 by Feng Yuxiang (馮玉祥) and Ji Hongchang (吉鴻昌).

=== 1948–1952 ===
In 1952, six years after becoming communist, the province was abolished and divided into parts of Inner Mongolia, Beijing Municipality and Hebei.
== Geography ==
Chahar Province was divided north-south by the Great Wall, with North Chahar being the larger in area and South Chahar, with the capital, Zhangjiakou, being far larger in population. It had an area of . In North Chahar most of the land was part of the northeastern extension of the Gobi Desert.

=== Bordered ===
* North: Xing&#x27;an
* North and West: Mongolia
* West and South : Suiyuan
* South: Shanxi and Hebei
* East: Rehe and Liaobei

<text>Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey, also known as Bill &amp; Ted 2, is a 1991 American science fiction comedy film, and the feature directorial debut of Pete Hewitt. It is the second film in the &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; franchise, and a sequel to &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989). Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter and George Carlin reprise their roles. The film, which partially spoofs &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, received mixed reviews from critics and grossed slightly less than its predecessor, but has since gained a cult following.

The film&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Go to Hell,&quot; and the film&#x27;s soundtrack featured the song &quot;Go to Hell&quot; by Megadeth, which Dave Mustaine wrote for the film.

The third movie in the franchise, &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot;, was released in August 2020, with Reeves, Winter, William Sadler, Amy Stoch and Hal Landon Jr. reprising their roles.

==Plot==
The music of Wyld Stallyns has created a utopian future society. In the year 2691, former gym teacher turned terrorist Chuck De Nomolos attacks the Bill &amp; Ted University and steals a time-traveling phone booth, intending to alter the history of what he considers to be a foolish and frivolous society by sending evil robot replicas of Bill and Ted back to the late 20th century to prevent the originals from winning the San Dimas Battle of the Bands. Rufus attempts to stop De Nomolos but seemingly becomes lost in the circuits of time.

In the present, Wyld Stallyns are auditioning for an upcoming Battle of the Bands. Though Bill and Ted&#x27;s current girlfriends and former 15th-century princesses Joanna and Elizabeth have become skilled musicians, the duo themselves are still inept. Despite this, the organizer, Ms. Wardroe, assures them a slot in the contest as the final act and informs them that victory will result in a record deal and $25,000 prize money. Following a party, the duo proposes to their girlfriends just as the evil robots arrive from the future. After luring the human duo away to Vasquez Rocks and killing them by throwing them over the side of a cliff, the robots begin working to ruin Bill and Ted&#x27;s eventual fame along with their relationships with their fiancées.

In the afterlife, Bill and Ted&#x27;s souls are met by Death who says they may challenge him in a game for their souls, but warns that nobody has ever won. Bill and Ted escape after giving Death a &quot;melvin&quot;. Attempts to contact the police by possessing Ted&#x27;s father and a deputy fail, and their next attempt for help at a séance held by Missy ends with them being sent to Hell. Tormented by Satan and forced to face their own fears, the duo realize their only escape is to take Death&#x27;s offer; he then appears and allows them to choose a game. To Death’s dismay, they select modern games like Battleship, Clue, Electric Football and Twister, beating him every time. Finally, he reluctantly concedes, placing himself at their command.

Realizing they need to build good robots to counter De Nomolos&#x27;s evil robots, Death escorts the pair to Heaven. God directs the group to an alien duo named &quot;Station&quot;, who readily agree to help them. On the eve of the Battle of the Bands, Bill and Ted are brought back to life. Having obtained supplies from the Builders Emporium store, the two Stations run at each other, merging to form a single giant being who constructs the benevolent robot versions of Bill and Ted in the back of the van as they race back to the concert. Elsewhere, the evil robots abduct the girls and tie them high above the stage at the Battle of the Bands, intending to drop them to their deaths at the finale.

Bill and Ted arrive just as the evil robots take the stage; the benevolent Good Robots easily defeat their evil counterparts and Joanna and Elizabeth are lowered by Station before their ropes break. De Nomolos appears in the time booth, preparing to kill Bill and Ted himself, and overrides the broadcasting equipment to send a live feed of their confrontation across the entire planet. Bill and Ted deduce that they can go back in time following the encounter to arrange events for De Nomolos to be captured in the present; though De Nomolos attempts to follow suit, the duo turn the tables by explaining that only the winners get to go back. After De Nomolos is &quot;melvined&quot; by Death and arrested by Ted&#x27;s father Captain Logan, Ms. Wardroe reveals herself to be a disguised Rufus, who gives them the stage.

Acknowledging their ineptness, the duo decide to use the time booth; they immediately return to the auditorium with their families, which now include young children, after sixteen months of intense guitar training and a two-week honeymoon. Joined by Death, the Stations and the good robots on stage, Wyld Stallyns perform a stunning rock ballad as De Nomolos&#x27;s broadcast continues, broadcasting their music worldwide and creating harmony. The victorious Wyld Stallyns encounter many perks of fame that help them to fulfill their destinies and create their utopian society with their music, eventually taking their act to Mars.

Progressive rock/metal band Primus appear as themselves during Battle of the Bands, performing &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot;. Musician Jim Martin, at the time the lead guitarist of Faith No More, also appears as himself, introduced by Rufus as &quot;Sir James Martin, head of the Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center.&quot; Candace and Lauren Mead portray &quot;Little Bill&quot; Logan and &quot;Little Ted&quot; Preston; with the characters revealed in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot; to be girls, whose full names are shown to be Billie Logan and Thea Preston.

Sadler had been drawn to the role of Death as at the time, he had been cast as a serious villain in numerous films, but had wanted to return to doing comedy as he had done earlier in the Broadway production of &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;. Having enjoyed &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, he thought the idea of Death as a villain in a comedic film would be a good role for him, auditioning via tape using an accent from Czechoslovakian actor Jan Tříska with whom he had co-performed in an earlier stage production. When he was called in to audition in person, they had asked him to come in aged makeup; Sadler contacted Scott Eddo, the makeup supervisor for &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; to make him look authentically old, which Sadler believed helped get him the role, along with the humor he injected into the audition. Sadler said that in the film, nearly everything Death does was written into the script, outside of the same accent that he used from his audition forward.

The name &quot;Station&quot; was the result of a leftover editing typo, according to the movie&#x27;s writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon. They had cut a scene from the script, labeled &quot;INT. POLICE STATION&quot; but had left the &quot;STATION&quot; part dangling, and as they were overtired at the time, found that saying &quot;Station&quot; in a &quot;[tiny] Martian voice&quot; was hilarious, and the name stuck.

==Soundtrack==
As was particularly common at the time, the soundtrack album focuses on the rock music heard throughout the film. An album of the full orchestral score by David Newman would not become available until 2007.

The song Bill and Ted play for the battle of the bands is &quot;Final Guitar Solo&quot; by Steve Vai, which he wrote to help blend into &quot;God Gave Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll to You II&quot; by Kiss, although Bill appears similar in appearance to Dusty Hill and Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top. Vai also does all of the guitar riffs when Bill &amp; Ted &quot;air guitar&quot; throughout the film.

There is also a reference to the lyrics from &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; by Poison.

== Home media ==
&quot;Bogus Journey&quot; was released on VHS in January 1992, then released on DVD, alongside &quot;Excellent Adventure&quot;, on December 4, 2001. It was then released by Pizza Hut on DVD in 2003, alongside All Dogs Go to Heaven 2, Honeymoon in Vegas and Mr. Mom. Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray for the first time on November 20, 2018.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 54 critics gave &quot;Bogus Journey&quot; a positive review, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads &quot;&quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; has the same stars—and cheerfully wacky sense of humor—as its predecessor, but they prove a far less effective combination the second time around.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an entertaining, surreal journey&quot; that is &quot;funnier and livelier than the original.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;amusing but sloppy and overcomplicated&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s the kind of movie where you start out snickering in spite of yourself, and end up actually admiring the originality that went into creating this hallucinatory slapstick.&quot; (Ebert did not see or review the first film.) Dave Kehr, then of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, also gave the film 3 stars. He stated that it is unusual for an Ingmar Bergman parody to show up in a teen comedy, and referred to the film as a &quot;genuine pleasure.&quot; Gene Siskel, also of the Tribune, gave the film only 2½ stars, but did say that the second film was better than the first. Leonard Maltin also gave &quot;Bogus Journey&quot; 2½ stars, a half-star more than he gave to &quot;Excellent Adventure.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film has &quot;a few triumphant moments, but not enough to sustain [the] pic&#x27;s running time.&quot;

==Marvel Comics adaptation==

To coincide with the release of &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, Marvel Comics released a one-shot comic book adaptation of the film, hiring Evan Dorkin to adapt the screenplay and pencil the art. Like Archie Goodwin&#x27;s adaptation of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, Dorkin worked from the original script, which included many deleted scenes such as the fears from Hell attempting to block Bill and Ted from the concert, and Evil Bill and Ted killing Bill and Ted before they remind the Reaper that they are owed lives from beating him so many times. Death was portrayed as the archetypal skeletal figure. Due to the popularity of the comic, Marvel commissioned a spin-off series, &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Comic Book&quot;, which kept the talents of Dorkin, DeStefano, and Severin. The series ran for 12 issues, featuring original stories, such as Death taking a vacation, a medieval version of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted gaining a band manager, a return by De Nomolos, an attempt to stop John Wilkes Booth, and meeting Little Bill and Ted from the future, who in this version were boys.

<doc id="254270" wikidata="Q1792901" url="?curid=254270" title="Joint product pricing">
<text>In microeconomics,joint product pricing is the firm&#x27;s problem of choosing prices for joint products, which are two or more products produced from the same process or operation, each considered to be of value. Pricing for joint products is more complex than pricing for a single product. To begin with, there are two demand curves. The characteristics of each could be different. Demand for one product could be greater than for the other. Consumers of one product could be more price elastic than consumers of the other (and therefore more sensitive to changes in the product&#x27;s price).

To complicate things further, both products, because they are produced jointly, share a common marginal cost curve. There are also complexities in the production function.

<text>Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Marsh is a fictional character in the adult animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. He is voiced by and loosely based on series co-creator Trey Parker. Stan is one of the series&#x27; four central characters, along with Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick. He debuted on television when &quot;South Park&quot; first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; shorts created by Parker and long-time collaborator Matt Stone in 1992 (&quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;) and 1995 (&quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;).

Stan is an elementary school student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Stan is generally depicted as logical, brave, patient and sensitive. He is outspoken in expressing his distinct lack of esteem for adults and their influences, as adult South Park residents rarely make use of their critical faculties.

Like the other &quot;South Park&quot; characters, Stan is animated by computer in a way to emulate the show&#x27;s original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the full-length feature film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; (1999), as well as &quot;South Park&quot;-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Stan as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues and has been frequently cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture and philosophy.

==Role in &quot;South Park&quot;==
Prior to season 22, Stan lives in South Park at 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos with his parents Randy and Sharon Marsh and his sister Shelly. During this period, Randy, who has an advanced degree in geology, works for the federal government at an earthquake monitoring facility, and Sharon is a secretary at Tom&#x27;s Rhinoplasty, a plastic surgery clinic. From season 22 onward, the family lives at a farm on the outskirts of town, where Randy raises marijuana and forces his reluctant family to assist him. Stan&#x27;s family includes his 13-year-old sister Shelly, who bullies and beats him, and his centenarian grandfather, Marvin, who calls Stan &quot;Billy&quot;. Stan attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison&#x27;s fourth-grade class. During the show&#x27;s first 58 episodes (1997 through the season 4 episode &quot;4th Grade&quot; in 2000), Stan and the other main child characters were in the third grade. His birthday is listed as October 19 (the same day as co-creator Trey Parker), 2001 on his Facebook page during the season 14 episode &quot;You Have 0 Friends&quot;. Stan is frequently embarrassed and annoyed by his father&#x27;s antics and frequent acts of public drunkenness. Stan&#x27;s relationship to his uncle Jimbo received moderate attention in the show&#x27;s first two seasons.

Whereas Kyle, his best friend, is the only Jewish boy in the main cast, Cartman is an obese, racist, sociopath, and Kenny is poverty-stricken (and in early seasons prone to suffer violent deaths), Stan was originally the everyman, described as &quot;a normal, average, American, mixed-up kid&quot;. Stan would also occasionally provide a &quot;moral of the story&quot; lesson at the end of certain episodes, such as in Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Grey Dawn&quot;, and Season 8&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Jew&quot;. However, beginning in season fifteen as part of the show&#x27;s overall shift to more complex characterization, Stan has been cynical and depressed due to his dysfunctional family, particularly in Ass Burgers which shows him abusing alcohol on a daily basis simply to tolerate normal social interaction.

Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is intended to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. As is the case with his other friends and classmates, Stan is frequently at odds with Cartman, resenting Cartman&#x27;s behavior and openly mocking his weight. Stan also shares a close friendship with Kenny, while Kenny professes that Stan is one of &quot;the best friends a guy could have&quot;. Stan can understand Kenny&#x27;s muffled voice perfectly and typically exclaims the catchphrase &quot;Oh my God! They killed Kenny!&quot; following one of Kenny&#x27;s trademark deaths, allowing Kyle to follow up with &quot;You bastards!&quot; Stan is the only character in the group to have had a steady girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger, and their relationship was a recurring topic in the show&#x27;s earlier seasons. Despite reconciling and declaring to be a couple again in the season 11 (2007) episode, &quot;The List&quot; after Wendy had dumped him in the season seven (2003) episode, &quot;Raisins&quot;, their relationship has seemed to drifted apart, but still are seen together in certain episodes. As a running gag, a nervous Stan often vomits whenever Wendy approaches to kiss or speak to him. Stan is considered particularly attractive by the girls in the class, which is a subtle joke as all of the fourth-grade boys, besides Cartman and the two disabled children (Timmy Burch and Jimmy Valmer), use the exact same model before hair, clothing, and skin color are added. In many episodes, Stan contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral dilemmas, and contentious issues, and will often reflect on the lessons he has attained with a speech that often begins with &quot;You know, I learned something today...&quot;.

==Character==

===Creation and design===

An unnamed precursor to Stan first appeared in the first &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When asked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly animated &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;, in which Stan also appeared. Stan next appeared on August 13, 1997, when &quot;South Park&quot; debuted on Comedy Central with the episode &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;.

In the tradition of the show&#x27;s animation style, Stan is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.
Ever since the show&#x27;s third episode, &quot;Weight Gain 4000&quot; (season one, 1997), Stan, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.

Stan is usually depicted in winter attire which consists of a brown jacket, blue jeans, red gloves/mittens, and a red-brimmed blue knit cap adorned with a decorative red pom-pom. In the rare instances, Stan is seen without his cap, he is shown to have shaggy black hair. He was given his full name in the season one episode &quot;An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig&quot;, sharing his surname of &quot;Marsh&quot; with Parker&#x27;s paternal step-grandfather. Parker specified that he came up with the voice of Stan while he and Stone were in film class, where they would speak in high-pitched childish voices, much to the annoyance of their film teachers. They would reuse these voices when &quot;South Park&quot; debuted. While originally voicing Stan without any computer manipulation, Parker now speaks within his normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.

Stan&#x27;s birthday is October 19, which is also Trey Parker&#x27;s birthday.

===Personality and traits===

Stan is foul-mouthed (a trait present in his friends as well) as a means for Parker and Stone to display how they claim young boys really talk when they are alone. In responding to certain situations, particularly during earlier seasons, Stan often exclaims &quot;Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here&quot;. While Stan is cynical and profane, Parker still notes that there is an &quot;underlying sweetness&quot; to the character, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Stan and his friends as &quot;sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence&quot;. He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.

Stan is an avid animal lover. He is highly against his uncle Jimbo&#x27;s hunting, and was also known to commit to vegetarianism after feeling compassion for baby calves in a farm, even going as far to hide them in his room to protect them from being slaughtered. Later, he was forced to quit vegetarianism because of a severe illness he developed, however, he still fights for animal rights, becoming a member of PETA in &quot;Douche and Turd&quot; as well as saving whales and dolphins in &quot;Whale Whores&quot;.

The only adult on the show that Stan liked was Chef, the cafeteria worker at his school, as Stan generally holds the rest of the show&#x27;s adult population in low regard due to their tendency to both behave irrationally when subjected to the scams, cults, and sensationalized media stories of which he is often skeptical, and engage in hypocritical behavior. He doubts the legitimacy of holistic medicine, declares cults to be dangerous, and regards those claiming to be psychic mediums as frauds, specifically by declaring John Edward to be &quot;the biggest douche in the universe&quot;.

In the season 15 episode &quot;You&#x27;re Getting Old&quot;, Stan became extremely cynical after his 10th birthday, and lost interest in many things that he once enjoyed. Stan&#x27;s friendships with the other main characters ended, his parents divorced, and he moved out of his home. This episode formed a cliffhanger and set off widespread speculation that the series was coming to an end. But the premiere of the second half of the season episode &quot;Ass Burgers&quot; resolved the arc, as Stan was erroneously diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome, and discovers Jameson Irish Whiskey cures cynicism. After struggling to repair his life, he finally explains he does not want things to go back to normal, when his parents get back together and his life is repaired. Although the end of the episode implies Stan may be permanently bound to whiskey to continue an everyday life.

==Cultural impact==

In 2014, Stan was ranked by IGN at third place on their list of &quot;The Top 25 South Park Characters&quot;, commenting that he &quot;often acts as the voice of reason in the midst of the show&#x27;s insane events, and in many ways he&#x27;s more mature than his father Randy&quot;. The website concluded that &quot;his history as one of the more stable and thoughtful characters in the series made him the perfect choice for the voice of Trey and Matt&#x27;s own creative/professional frustrations&quot;.

Stan frequently offers his perspective on religion, and he was at the center of one of the most controversial episodes of the series, &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; (season nine, 2005), where he was recognized as the reincarnation of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard before denouncing the church as nothing more than &quot;a big fat global scam&quot;.

In the show&#x27;s 26 seasons, Stan has addressed other topics such as homosexuality, hate crime legislation, civil liberties, parenting, illegal immigration, voting, alcoholism, and race relations. His commentary on these issues have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public, and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world. The book &quot;South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today&quot; includes an essay in which East Carolina University philosophy professor Henry Jacoby compares Stan&#x27;s actions and reasoning within the show to the philosophical teachings of William Kingdon Clifford, and another essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor John S. Gray which references Stan&#x27;s decision to not vote for either candidate for a school mascot in the season eight (2004) episode &quot;Douche and Turd&quot; when describing political philosophy and the claimed pitfalls of a two-party system. Essays in the books &quot;South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating&quot;, &quot;Blame Canada! South Park and Contemporary Culture&quot;, and &quot;Taking South Park Seriously&quot; have also analyzed Stan&#x27;s perspectives within the framework of popular philosophical, theological, and political concepts.

<text>Mikhail Mikhailovich Kasyanov (; born 8 December 1957) is a Russian politician who served as Prime Minister of Russia from 2000 to 2004. Previously, he had served as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2000 and Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2000. During the 1990s, he worked in President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s administration in different positions before joining President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s first administration. He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

Since leaving the government over disagreements on economic policy in 2004, he has become one of the leading critics of President Putin and an opposition leader. In 2008, Kasyanov was a candidate in the election of President of Russia but in the middle of the campaign was denied participation on political grounds. In 2010, he co-founded the coalition People&#x27;s Freedom Party &quot;For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption&quot; and became one of the leaders of the People&#x27;s Freedom Party. He was an active speaker during the 2011–2013 Russian protests for fair elections. Since 2015, he has served as the leader of the political party People&#x27;s Freedom Party (PARNAS). From 2005 to 2007, he was one of the leaders of the opposition coalition The Other Russia and democratic protest movement.

==Early life==
Kasyanov was born on 8 December 1957 in the settlement of Solntsevo near Moscow. His father was a teacher of mathematics and the headmaster of a local school. Joining the Red Army, his father participated in some major actions of the Second World War and fought until the victory in 1945. Kasyanov&#x27;s mother was an economist, a head of a department of a governmental construction company (Glavmosstroy). In his childhood Mikhail studied at a music school and played the cello. In high school he played in a rock group. In 1974 Kasyanov entered the Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University. In 1976–1978, he served in the Soviet Army in the guard of honour at the Office of the Commandant of Moscow, which is today the Kremlin Regiment of the Federal Protective Service. From 19781981, he became a technician and then an engineer at the scientific institute of the State Committee for Construction of USSR. At the time he was still studying at the Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University. He finished in 1981. For nine years after graduation Kasyanov worked at the State Planning Committee (GosPlan) as an engineer, economist, leading specialist and chief of sector. In 1987 he was awarded the diploma of the Highest Economy Courses at GosPlan.

==Career==
===Ministry of Economy (1990–1993)===
In 1990–1993, Kasyanov was working in the State Committee of Economy of the Russian Federation and then in the Ministry of Economy. In 1993 the Minister of Finance Boris Fyodorov invited Kasyanov to join the Ministry. He was appointed the head of Foreign Loans and External Debt Department.

===Ministry then Minister of Finance (1995–1999)===
In 1995 Kasyanov became the deputy Minister of Finance.

In 1994–1996, Kasyanov was occupied with the restructuring of Soviet externals debts (about $150 bn). In 1996 Kasyanov reached an agreement with the Paris Club and the London Club of creditors for a comprehensive restructuring of Soviet debts for a period of 25 years with a 7-year grace period. Thanks to this agreement Russia was able to gain access to international capital markets. In 1996 Kasyanov gave the road show of Russia&#x27;s economy development prospects at various International finance centers. As a result, Russia, for the first time since 1913 issued securities, eurobonds on the capital markets of Europe and the United States, and Russian banks and companies were able to take cheap foreign capital for investments into the economy of the country.

In 1998, the global financial crisis started and the Russian government defaulted on its debts, ruble was dramatically devaluated. Kasyanov was the head of the working team for restructuring Russian government external debts and of the private banks of the country. At the same time he negotiated with Russian creditors for restructuring domestic debts. Kasyanov negotiated with the International Monetary Fund which granted favorable perspectives for reaching profitable agreements for Russia. As a result of this, the ruble rate was stabilised, which in its own turn helped reduce the inflation and restored production and services parts of Russian economy. These successes proved Kasyanov to be a good negotiator: he was called &quot;the principal financial diplomat of the country&quot;.

===Minister of Finance (1999–2000)===
In February 1999 he was appointed First Deputy Minister and in May 1999 President Yeltsin appointed Kasyanov Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation.

In June 1999, Minister Kasyanov became a member of the Security Council of Russia.

Kasyanov was occupied with the problem of budget deficit and external debt. His time as Finance Minister saw Russia&#x27;s first non-deficit budget. In July Russia received the first post-crisis loan from the IMF.

The government of Sergei Stepashin worked for three months; however, Kasyanov retained his post in the new government of Vladimir Putin. He continued the negotiations with international creditors on a global restructuring of the USSR&#x27;s debts.

The war in Chechnya provoked the suspension of the negotiations with the London club of creditors. Nevertheless, Kasyanov was able to resolve the principal problems of Russian debts in a span of several months. This fact facilitated the transition towards economic growth in Russia. As a result of non-deficit budget and prudent financial policy in general the multi-month delays in salary payments and pensions were overcome. On 10 January 2000 Kasyanov was appointed the first Vice Premier of the Russian government. The situation was such that effectively Kasyanov was in charge of the government, serving as its chairman, as Putin was the Acting President at the time. He was still the head of the Ministry of Finance.

===Prime Minister (2000–2004)===

On 17 May 2000, Russian State Duma approved Mikhail Kasyanov&#x27;s Prime Minister candidacy. The Chairman of the Cabinet started pursuing the policy of active collaboration with business community and civil society.

During its four-year term Kasyanov&#x27;s Cabinet launched a number of structural reforms – tax and budget reform, liberalization of capital control and external trade, customs reform, reorganization of national infrastructure, pension reform, creation of land market and others. Successful implementation of systemic transformation measures led Russia to a trajectory of sustainable economic growth. Inflation was reduced significantly, the economy and people&#x27;s income grew by one third while oil prices were at the level of $20–25 per barrel.

Experts think that the tax reform of 2000-2002 was one of the most successful reforms of Kasyanov&#x27;s Cabinet. A flat income tax rate (13%) was introduced. All turnover taxes were eliminated. VAT was reduced to 18% and social taxes — to 26%. These measures together with the policy of strong fiscal discipline significantly increased budget revenue.

In addition to this in 2003 Kasyanov&#x27;s Cabinet reformed the taxation of petroleum sector and established a special Stabilization fund. As a result, the budget revenue stream from this sector has increased and the Stabilization Fund has started accumulating significant amounts of foreign exchange, creating a financial airbag for the country. It was a time of an overall financial liberalization.
An important achievement of Kasyanov&#x27;s Cabinet was the successful implementation of the small business encouragement policy. Introduction of simplified taxation system, easy state registration of businesses and ban on frequent inspections by state agencies were among those measures.

It was during Mikhail Kasyanov&#x27;s time as Russian Prime Minister that the transfer of agricultural lands to private property began. Additionally to that credit support mechanism for agricultural production was introduced and Russia very rapidly again became one of the leading exporters of grain after decades of huge annual import of wheat.

Kasyanov was dismissed, along with the entire Russian cabinet, by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February 2004 after more than three years in office, two weeks before the 2004 Russian presidential election on 14 March. There were disagreements between Kasyanov and Putin on matters of policy. The President stated on national television &quot;This decision bears no relation to any assessment of the performance of the former composition of the government. It was dictated by my desire to once again delineate my position on the issue of what development course the country will take after March 14, 2004.&quot;

==Political activity after resignation==
===After leaving the government (2004–2008)===
On the first anniversary of his dismissal (24 February 2005) Kasyanov gave a press conference at which he said that he might run for president in the 2008 elections. His bid was supported by Leonid Nevzlin, Boris Berezovsky and Garry Kasparov.

In April 2006, Mikhail Kasyanov was elected Chairman of the People&#x27;s Democratic Union (PDU), a newly launched NGO. PDU was one of the co-founders of the first &quot;The Other Russia&quot; conference in July 2006 and of &quot;The Other Russia&quot; coalition that was set up at the conference. Kasyanov and the PDU were actively involved in the coalition&#x27;s work and took part in the Dissenters&#x27; Marches in Moscow and St. Petersburg – the first protest manifestations in many years. On 3 March 2007, Kasparov and Kasyanov spoke against Putin&#x27;s government to thousands of supporters at the Saint Petersburg Dissenters&#x27; March.

At a presentation in International Institute for Strategic Studies 26 June 2006, Kasyanov criticized Putin&#x27;s administration. He said:
&quot;Separation of powers has been effectively demolished and replaced by the so-called ‘Vertical of Power&#x27; which is based on the false idea that all the meaningful social and political processes must be kept under control by the state. The government and parliament cannot function any longer without daily instructions. The judiciary is increasingly servile. Independent TV does not exist any more at the federal level and is being quickly uprooted in the regions. Moreover, the state-owned companies and the state itself increase their grip over the electronic and printed media. Responsibility of the regional level of power is totally destroyed by the abolishment of direct elections for the governors.&quot;

PDU had regional branches in 75 regions of Russia. In June 2007 Kasyanov was nominated by the PDU as a candidate for the presidential elections. In September 2007 the new political party People for Democracy and Justice () was established on the basis of the PDU, and Kasyanov was elected its chairman.

====Fraud accusations and court case (2005–2007)====
Allegations that Kasyanov took a two percent commission in exchange for ignoring bribes and illegal business ventures whilst he was working at the Ministry of Finance between 1993 and 1999 were made in the state-controlled Russian media which branded him as &quot;Misha 2 percent&quot;. In an article by Peter J. Stavrakis entitled &quot;Russia&#x27;s evolution as a predatory state&quot; (part of a compilation entitled &quot;Russia&#x27;s uncertain economic future&quot;, written for the United States Congressional Joint Economic Committee), the allegations were unsurprisingly described as credible.

In July 2005, State Duma deputy from the United Russia faction Alexander Khinshtein made accusations against Mikhail Kasyanov; according to Khinshtein, Kasyanov, when he was prime minister, privatized &quot;Sosnovka-1&quot;, the former state dacha of Mikhail Suslov, a former member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in 2003 at a reduced price. The used the published materials as a reason to initiate a criminal case on 1 July 2005 against the general director of FSUE VPK Invest Ramil Gaisin under Article 165 Part 3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot;causing property damage on an especially large scale by deception or abuse of trust&quot;). The publication of the materials and the message from the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office about the initiation of a criminal case coincided with Kasyanov&#x27;s stay on vacation abroad:
On 11 July 2005, the Russian Office of Public Prosecutor started investigating the privatization of two houses formerly owned by the government. According to the court verdict of 16 March 2007, Kasyanov was to return a house and pay 108,135,000 rubles in damages to the government for using the property illegally (approx. USD 4,150,000 or €3,130,000). In 2007, Kasyanov was still planning to appeal.

Khinshtein&#x27;s assumptions were not confirmed. The &quot;Sosnovka-1&quot; facility was acquired by Kasyanov legally after he left government service. In 1996, the Evikhon company leased the facility for 49 years from the State Property Committee, then &quot;Sosnovka-1&quot; was transferred to the management of the VPK-Invest company, which in 2003 received the right to sell dachas. First, &quot;Sosnovka-1&quot; was acquired by the Amelia company, and in 2004, it was resold to Mikhail Kasyanov. In 2006, the Moscow Arbitration Court recognized Kasyanov as a bona fide purchaser and refused to return the property to the state. However, the Federal Agency for State Property Management filed new claims, and in 2007, by a court decision, the dacha was returned to state ownership.

A &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; article from 2007 notes that Kasyanov insists that his only earnings as a public servant were his government salary, and he has only been involved in private business ventures for &quot;one year&quot; since leaving the post of prime minister. The same article also supported Khinshtein&#x27;s claim about &quot;Sosnovka-1&quot;.

===2008 presidential candidacy===

In 2006, Kasyanov declared that he desired to establish a new political party and run for president in 2008.

Kasyanov left the opposition group The Other Russia in July 2007 due to the group&#x27;s failure to agree on a single presidential candidate.

Kasyanov established the Russian Popular Democratic Union party. However, the Federal Registration Service blocked the party from participating in the 2007 legislative election.

It was not known whether Kasyanov would continue his candidacy after Garry Kasparov entered the race, but on 8 December 2007 he reaffirmed he would run in the election. That day Russian Popular Democratic Union Party nominated Kasyanov as their presidential candidate.

On 16 January 2008, he announced that he had finished collecting the 2 million signatures necessary to run as a candidate. Later that month, however, the Central Election Commission rejected his candidacy on the grounds that 13.36% of the signatures were invalid. and he was disqualified. Kasyanov appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which rejected the appeal on 6 February 2008.
Kasyanov claimed that the decision to prevent his candidacy was taken by Putin himself, who he claimed was afraid that, in a fair election, Dmitry Medvedev might lose.

Kasyanov described the elections as a farce and called for a boycott.

===Author: &quot;Without Putin&quot; (2009)===
The presentation of Kasyanov&#x27;s book &quot;Without Putin&quot; in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on 18 December 2009 was cancelled merely minutes before its planned opening. Kasyanov&#x27;s press secretary claimed that the electricity went out in the Premier Palace Hotel on minutes before the presentation was to start and that some 20 young men had blocked the entrance to the hotel to keep attendees from entering.

===Kadyrov&#x27;s threats against Kasyanov (2016)===

In February 2016, Kasyanov&#x27;s image was posted online by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on his social media account, with Kasyanov being in cross hairs of a sniper rifle. This was seen as a threat against Kasyanov. On 10 February, Kasyanov was attacked in a Moscow restaurant by a dozen men who yelled death threats at him.

===Defection over Ukraine (2022)===
He opposed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In May 2022, Kasyanov participated in the 8th &quot;Russia Forum&quot; in Vilnius, together with Khodorkovsky, the Russian oil oligarch and former head of Russian oil and gas giant Yukos, the head of the US-think tank Freedom House, the head of the US-government funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe and others. The aim of the &quot;anti-Putin summit&quot; was to develop a strategy on how to &quot;de-Putinise&quot; Russia and &quot;slay the Russian bear&quot;, meaning Vladimir Putin.

In June 2022, Kasyanov told Agence France-Presse that he had temporarily left Russia, without providing additional details and as of June 2023, he is in the Latvian capital of Riga.

In November 2023, Russia&#x27;s Justice Ministry said he was added to the list of &quot;foreign agents&quot;.

<text>The Ninth Configuration (also known as Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane) is a 1980 American psychological drama film written, produced, and directed by William Peter Blatty, in his directorial debut. It is the second installment in Blatty&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy of Faith&quot; after &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), and followed by &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990). The film is based on Blatty&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, which was itself a reworking of his 1966 novel &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane!&quot; The initial 1966 publication of the novel featured an exclamation mark at the end of the title, while all subsequent publications saw it removed.

The first half of the film has the predominant tone and style of a comic farce. In the second half, the film becomes darker as it delves deeper into its central issues of human suffering, sacrifice and faith. The film also frequently blurs the line between the sane and insane. The film received positive reviews from critics, and was recognized with the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay and two other nominations at the 38th Golden Globe Awards.

==Plot==

In the early 1970s, towards the end of the Vietnam War, a castle in the Pacific Northwest is used by the US government as an insane asylum for military personnel. Among the patients there is former astronaut Billy Cutshaw, who aborted a Moon launch and was dragged screaming from the capsule, suffering from an apparent mental breakdown.

Colonel Hudson Kane, a former member of a United States Marine Corps special unit, arrives at the castle to take over the patients&#x27; treatment. Colonel Fell helps Kane acclimatise himself to the eccentricities of the patients. Kane eventually talks to Cutshaw, who refuses to answer why he did not want to go to the Moon. Instead, he gives Kane a St. Christopher medal. Lieutenant Reno, who is there attempting to stage Shakespeare plays with a cast of dogs, suspects that Kane is crazy himself.

Meanwhile, Kane constantly has nightmares of his brother Vincent, a former patient and murderer who is now dead. Cutshaw talks with Kane again, and they debate God and the idea that there is a divine plan. Kane, who believes that the existence of a God is far more likely than humanity&#x27;s having emerged from &quot;random chance&quot;, argues that deeds of pure self-sacrifice are proof of human goodness, which can only be explained by divine purpose. Cutshaw demands that Kane recall one concrete example of pure self-sacrifice from his personal experience; Kane is unable. Kane takes Cutshaw to a church service, which Cutshaw interrupts with several outbursts, and Kane momentarily hallucinates. After returning to the castle, Cutshaw thanks Kane and asks him to send him a sign as proof of an afterlife should Kane die first. Kane promises to try.

Kane then meets with a new patient who calls him &quot;Killer Kane&quot;. Kane flashes back to Vietnam, where he killed a young boy. The soldier urges Kane to leave, and he screams. In the present, Kane collapses, unconscious. Fell explains to the staff that Kane is Vincent &quot;Killer&quot; Kane and suffered a breakdown in Vietnam. When Fell, who is Kane&#x27;s brother Hudson, was dispatched back to America, Kane received the dispatch by accident. Kane created a new persona for himself – a healer, like his brother. Subconsciously hoping to heal people to make up for his &quot;murders&quot;, Kane returned to the US as his brother. Realizing Kane&#x27;s mental state, the Army psychiatric staff maintained the charade and sent him to Fell&#x27;s hospital under the pretext of being its commanding officer. In reality, Fell has been the commanding officer all along. Kane awakens and remembers nothing of the incident.

Cutshaw escapes the castle and visits a bar. A biker gang recognizes Cutshaw from news reports and brutalize him. A waitress contacts the hospital, and Kane arrives to retrieve Cutshaw. Kane humbles himself to the bikers to extricate Cutshaw, but the bikers are disgusted by his behavior and assault him. The gang attempts to rape Cutshaw, causing Kane to snap and kill most of them with his bare hands.

Kane and Cutshaw return to the castle, and the police arrive to arrest Kane for the murders at the bar. Fell interjects and tells the policemen that Kane must stay since he was provoked. Cutshaw later visits Kane. Dreamy and distant, Kane mumbles to Cutshaw about God and proof of human goodness before passing out. Cutshaw reveals that the reason that he did not want to go to the Moon was because he was terrified of being alone in space. Cutshaw&#x27;s admission appears to resurrect some lucidity within himself. As Cutshaw leaves, Kane&#x27;s hand drops a bloodied knife. Outside Kane&#x27;s room, Cutshaw notices blood on his shoe. Rushing back in, Cutshaw discovers that Kane had actually been injured in the bar fight and refused to get help, effectively committing suicide to provide proof of human goodness.

Some time later, Cutshaw returns to uniform, and visits the now-abandoned castle. After reading a note left by Kane, which expresses hope that his sacrifice will shock Cutshaw back to sanity, Cutshaw finds a Saint Christopher&#x27;s medal has somehow appeared in his car. He turns it over to confirm whether it was the one he gave to Kane and silently rejoices at what he sees.

==Cast==
==Background==
William Peter Blatty&#x27;s novel &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane!&quot; was first published in 1966. Blatty said: &quot;I considered it a comic novel, but a great deal of philosophy and theology crept into it. But the farcical elements outweighed the serious elements.&quot; Blatty adapted the novel into a screenplay, and intended for it to be filmed by William Friedkin. Blatty said that the script &quot;was what you might call bizarre material. I had hoped to direct it myself. But after seeing &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; I thought the script would be safe with Friedkin. I sent it along to him. He liked it. But we couldn&#x27;t find a studio that liked it.&quot; Blatty and Friedkin would later collaborate on the film version of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), with Blatty as screenwriter/producer and Friedkin as director, before Blatty returned to &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane!&quot; In lieu of filming the novel, Blatty decided to rewrite it: &quot;After &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, I decided that I could develop the story a great deal. So I rewrote it and fleshed it out, Cutshaw became the astronaut in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; that Regan warns about going into outer space and fully developed the deeper implications and theological themes.&quot; The rewritten version of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane!&quot; was published in 1978 under the title &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;.

In his introduction to the 1978 novel, Blatty wrote:

However, Blatty subsequently stated he preferred the first version of the book to the second: &quot;...the first one is infinitely funnier and wilder, and stranger and more of a one of a kind; the second one has the same plot, but the prose is more finely crafted, I think. In the first one I allowed the comedy to carry me, so I think I prefer that one...I loved the characters and it was a pleasure to write.&quot;

Blatty then developed &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; into a screenplay for Columbia Pictures (Blatty did not want to work with Warner Bros. as he had sued that studio over his proper share of profits from &quot;The Exorcist&quot;). Columbia then placed the screenplay in turnaround; Blatty took the script to Universal Pictures. Universal rejected it; according to Blatty, this was &quot;not because of any consideration of quality, but simply because Columbia had let it go. There was nobody prepared to take a chance on their own judgement.&quot;

With no major film studio prepared to fund &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, Blatty decided to raise the film&#x27;s $4 million budget by putting up half the money himself and persuading the PepsiCo conglomerate to provide the remaining $2 million. As writer/director of the film, Blatty was promised complete creative control over the production by PepsiCo with only one stipulation: that the film had to be shot in Hungary (PepsiCo had blocked funds in that country, and reinvested money from the film&#x27;s production into a Pepsi bottling plant there). Ironically, Warner Bros. wound up initially releasing the film in selected markets, despite Blatty&#x27;s misgivings.

==Casting==
Blatty retained Jason Miller, who had played Father Karras in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, for &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;. Ed Flanders (once considered for the role of Karras in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;) was also cast; Michael Moriarty was set to play Captain Billy Cutshaw but dropped out of the production (he was replaced by Scott Wilson, who was originally cast as Fairbanks). For the central role of Colonel Kane, Blatty cast Stacy Keach (another contender for the part of Father Karras in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;). Blatty had originally cast Nicol Williamson in the role of Kane, before deciding that the British actor was wrong for the part: &quot;I was deluding myself. I so desperately admired [Williamson] and wanted him in my picture that I persuaded myself that he could be an American Marine corps colonel. I realised during rehearsals. He was magnificent, but there was no way he could be an American colonel. He came to Budapest and we rehearsed for two weeks. And we were coming up to the weekend before our first shoot on the following Monday, and then I remembered one of the people I&#x27;d strongly considered was Stacy Keach. And we found out that night that he was available and he was with us on Tuesday.&quot; Stacy Keach recalls the situation differently: &quot;Ironically, I was the lucky benefactor of a Nicol tantrum in the late &#x27;70s. William Peter Blatty had cast him as Killer Kane in &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; (also known as &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane&quot;), and the film was being shot in Budapest, Hungary. Nicol was staying at the Budapest Hilton, and was allegedly trying to make an international phone call when, presumably, something the operator did or said infuriated him, causing him to rip the phone out of the wall and toss it through the plate-glass window of his suite. Nicol was fired, and I was hired to play the role. It was a great part, and I often reflected on how Nicol would have played certain moments during the filming. I have no doubts that he would have been brilliant, as he always was. We became friends for a time, and I loved his company.&quot;

Tom Atkins had a minor role in the film, and in an interview in January 2009, he discussed what the film shoot was like: &quot;I have always believed that a movie about the making of that film would have been much better than the actual movie turned out to be. It was kind of a zoo from the very beginning. William Peter Blatty wrote and directed it and financed part of it by selling a home that he had in Malibu. His idea of getting a good ensemble effort from his actors was to take people over to Budapest for two months—the part I had might have taken two weeks in the States but he had us all over there for two months. All he ended up getting was 22 really upset, angry and drunk actors who had a lot of trouble showing up for work. I thought that the script was wonderful but I don’t think that Blatty ever got what he wanted up on the screen. I think a lot of us took the job because we would be able to go to Prague and Moscow and bounce around Europe when we weren’t working. He decided that he would put up the call sheet for the next day at midnight so that you couldn’t go anywhere.&quot;

Blatty himself appears briefly near the start of the film as a patient pretending to be an army doctor (he is the one who stole Ed Flanders&#x27; pants; the role was originally intended for George DiCenzo, but once Michael Moriarty dropped out, DiCenzo was given the role of Fairbanks, originally intended for Scott Wilson, and Blatty decided to fill the role himself), and would later cast Jason Miller, Ed Flanders, Scott Wilson, and Nicol Williamson in his next film as writer/director, &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990).

==Release and reception==
United Film Distribution (UFD), affiliated with the United Artists theatre chain and best known for releasing George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, picked up the film for a planned December 1979 release; however, the company dropped the picture, and Warner Bros. subsequently picked it up. After initially poor box office returns in its test markets, Warner Bros. returned the film to Blatty and allowed him to take it to another distributor. UFD re-acquired the rights and released it in other markets under the title &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane&quot;. It was not a commercial success upon its cinematic release in 1980; however, it received generally strong reviews and a Best Picture nomination at the 38th Golden Globe Awards in January 1981. Although the film did not win, Blatty did win a Golden Globe for the film&#x27;s screenplay. Blatty re-edited the film for its 1985 re-release, which was distributed by New World Pictures under the original title, &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . Leonard Maltin has described the movie as &quot;hilarious yet thought-provoking, with endlessly quotable dialogue and an amazing barroom fight scene.&quot; Blatty&#x27;s screenplay was later published in 2000 with commentary by English film critic Mark Kermode (Kermode also contributed to the audio commentary and featurette on the film&#x27;s DVD release in 2002). Kermode has described &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; as &quot;a breathtaking cocktail of philosophy, eye-popping visuals, jaw-dropping pretentiousness, rib-tickling humour and heart-stopping action. From exotically hallucinogenic visions of a lunar crucifixion to the claustrophobic realism of a bar-room brawl, via such twisted vignettes as Robert Loggia karaoking to Al Jolson and Moses Gunn in Superman drag, Blatty directs like a man with no understanding of, or interest in, the supposed limits of mainstream movie-making. The result is a work of matchless madness which divides audiences as spectacularly as the waves of the Red Sea, a cult classic that continues to provoke either apostolic devotion or baffled dismissal 20 years on.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
*38th Golden Globe Awards
**Best Film – Drama – Nomination
**Best Supporting Actor – Scott Wilson – Nomination
**Best Screenplay – William Peter Blatty – WON
*Saturn Awards
**Best Screenplay – William Peter Blatty – WON
** Best Fantasy Film – Nomination

==Alternate versions==
Several versions of &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; were released in cinemas and on video tape and DVD (one version retained the title &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane&quot;). In the original theatrical release and the Blatty-endorsed DVD, it is the intention that Kane killed himself with the knife. In some versions released during the intervening years, an alternate ending was used in which it is said (via added voiceover by Stacy Keach) that Kane died of wounds inflicted by the bikers.

==2016 remastered edition==
The UK company Second Sight Films and the USA company Shout! Factory remastered this film in April 2016 for DVD and Blu-ray. It featured an added memorial dedication to Blatty&#x27;s late son, Peter Vincent Blatty, who died in 2006 from a rare heart disorder. The dedication also mistakenly had the theme from the first two logos of Lorimar Television in a high pitch (due to a NTSC-to-PAL conversion) playing over it.

<text>California&#x27;s Gold is a public television human interest program that explores the natural, cultural, and historical features of California. The series ran for 24 seasons beginning in 1991, and was produced and hosted by Huell Howser in collaboration with KCET, Los Angeles. The series ceased production when Howser retired in November 2012, shortly before his death on January 7, 2013, although episodes continue to be shown on KCET and are featured on the page at the station&#x27;s website about his shows.

The series theme song is &quot;California, Here I Come&quot;. Typically, it is performed by local musicians who may be from a given episode&#x27;s locale. However some episodes include an old-time recording of the California state song &quot;I Love You, California&quot;.

==Production==

The minimal production allowed locations and people to remain the focal point of the program. 
Howser&#x27;s archives are now housed at Chapman University in Orange, California, and can be streamed online. The decision to donate them grew out his experiences making an episode of the show.

==Episodes==
&quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; is divided into 24 seasons of varying lengths (plus specials), comprising 443 episodes.

In May 2016, KCET showed a &quot;lost&quot; episode on the Charles F. Lummis House, now considered to be the final episode. In March 2018, documentary filmmaker John McDonald released an unofficial episode of the series. &quot;California&#x27;s Gold: The Ghost Mountain Experiment&quot; documents the life of California hermit Marshal South and family, and incorporates previously unreleased footage produced by Howser.

==Related shows==
Several related shows were also produced by Huell Howser Productions in collaboration with KCET. These were &quot;California&#x27;s Green&quot;, a show about environmentally friendly measures being undertaken in California; &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Coast&quot;; &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Parks&quot;; &quot;California&#x27;s Water&quot;; &quot;California&#x27;s Missions&quot;; &quot;Road Trip&quot;, a show about sights along California&#x27;s highways and byways; &quot;Downtown&quot;, a show about Los Angeles&#x27; downtown; &quot;Visiting...&quot;, a show about sights in the Los Angeles area; and &quot;Palm Springs&quot;.

<text>Vine is a demon listed in demonological grimoires such the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (including Thomas Rudd&#x27;s version) Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;.

These texts rank Vine as both a king and an earl, describing him as a lion riding a black horse and carrying a viper. They ascribe to him the power to build towers, destroy walls, disturb seas, and furthermore answer questions on secrets, witches, and events past, present, and future.

Vine may be derived from or otherwise connected to the spirit &quot;Royne&quot; in the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, who is described only as an earl appearing like a lion-faced soldier (still riding a black horse and carrying a snake). Royne is given the power to build not only towers but houses, and can only answer questions on treasures or secrets but also has love magic, the ability to destroy enemies and consecrate objects (books especially).

According to Rudd, Vine is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Sealiah.

== Popular Culture ==
Vine is portrayed as a first-year student attending the Babyls demon school in the Japanese anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

<text>Bifrons is a demon described in the demonological grimoires the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (as the forty-sixth spirit) and the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (as the forty-seventh spirit), as well as being mentioned in the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;. These works describe Bifrons as an earl who initially appears as a monster before adopting a more human form. His duties include teaching arts and sciences, including astrology, geometry, and the properties of different plants and stones. He also moves bodies into different graves, lights candles over graves, and (depending on the version) commands either 6, 26, or 60 legions of spirits.

The word &quot;bifrons&quot; literally means &quot;two-faced&quot; in Latin, and is also a prominent epithet of the ancient Roman god Janus, which suggests that Bifrons may be a corrupted and demonized form of Janus. According to Rudd, Bifrons is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Ariel.

<text>Vanadinite is a mineral belonging to the apatite group of phosphates, with the chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is one of the main industrial ores of the metal vanadium and a minor source of lead. A dense, brittle mineral, it is usually found in the form of red hexagonal crystals. It is an uncommon mineral, formed by the oxidation of lead ore deposits such as galena. First discovered in 1801 in Mexico, vanadinite deposits have since been unearthed in South America, Europe, Africa, and North America.

==Origins==
Vanadinite is an uncommon mineral, only occurring as the result of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral. It is found in arid climates and forms by oxidation of primary lead minerals. Vanadinite is especially found in association with the lead sulfide, galena. Other associated minerals include wulfenite, limonite, and barite.

It was originally discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He called the mineral &quot;brown lead&quot; and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, he was later led to believe that this was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río&#x27;s &quot;brown lead&quot; was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo, Mexico, and was named vanadinite because of its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to vanadinite are johnstonite and lead vanadate.

==Occurrence==
Vanadinite occurs as a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits; the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, pyromorphite, descloizite, mottramite, wulfenite, cerussite, anglesite, calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.

Deposits of vanadinite are found worldwide including Austria, Spain, Scotland, the Ural Mountains, South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Argentina, Mexico, and four states of the United States: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and South Dakota.

Vanadinite deposits are found in over 400 mines across the world. Notable vanadinite mines include those at Mibladen and Touisset in Morocco; Tsumeb, Namibia; Cordoba, Argentina; and Sierra County, New Mexico, and Gila County, Arizona, in the United States.

==Structure==
Vanadinite is a lead chlorovanadate with the chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions at the corners of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317 picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48 Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the corners of an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76 Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.

Crystals of vanadinite conform to a hexagonal system of symmetry. This internal structure is often reflected in the hexagonal external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually in the form of short hexagonal prisms, but can also be found as hexagonal pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A unit cell of vanadinite, the smallest divisible unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, is in the form of a hexagonal prism. The unit cell of vanadinite is composed of two of its molecules and has the dimensions &quot;a&quot; = 10.331 Å and &quot;c&quot; = 7.343 Å, where &quot;a&quot; is the length of each side of the hexagon and &quot;c&quot; is the height of the prism. The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;c&quot; sin(60°), is 678.72 Å3.

==Characteristics==
Vanadinite is in the apatite group of phosphates, and forms a chemical series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium (in the first two cases) or lead (in the second). Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.

Vanadinite is usually bright-red or orange-red in colour, although sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak can be either pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.

Vanadinite is very brittle, producing small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, about the same as a copper coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27 g/mol and its specific gravity can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.

==Uses==
Along with carnotite and roscoelite, vanadinite is one of the main industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850 °C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.

<doc id="254290" wikidata="Q869084" url="?curid=254290" title="Cord (automobile)">
<text>Cord was a brand of American luxury automobile manufactured by the Auburn Automobile Company of Connersville, Indiana, from 1929 to 1932 and again in 1936 and 1937.

Auburn was wholly owned by the Cord Corporation, founded and run by E. L. Cord as a holding company for his many transportation interests (which included the Lycoming engines, Stinson aircraft, and Checker Motors). Cord was noted for its innovative technology and streamlined designs.

== Innovations ==
Cord innovations include front-wheel drive on the L-29 and hidden headlamps on the 810 and 812.

Though DeSoto used them in 1942, hidden headlamps did not reappear as a luxury feature until the 1960s, beginning with the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette. It was followed two years later by another General Motors product, the Buick Riviera, whose GM stylists later stated they were trying to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of the Cord&#x27;s design.

&quot;Servo&quot; shifting was accomplished through a Bendix electro-vacuum pre-selector mechanism (a type of electromechanical shifting).

== Cord L-29 ==

This was the first American front-wheel drive car to be offered to the public, beating the Ruxton automobile by several months, in 1929. The brainchild of former Miller engineer Cornelius Van Ranst, its drive system borrowed from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes. Built in Auburn, Indiana, the Cord was the first front-wheel-drive car to use constant-velocity joints. While commonly used today in all front-wheel-drive vehicles, their first use was on the 1929 Cord. The lack of rear drivetrain components and straight frame (without rear kick-up to clear up the rear axle) allowed it to be much lower in height than competing cars whose average height was about six feet or almost two metres. Both stock cars and special bodies built on the Cord chassis by American and European coachbuilders won prizes in contests worldwide. The L-29 came with full instrumentation, including a temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and speedometer on the left with a gas gauge, oil level gauge, and ammeter on the right of the steering wheel.

It was powered by a Lycoming L-head inline 8 from the Auburn 120, with the crankshaft pushed out through the front of the block and the flywheel mounted there, driving a three-speed transmission. Gearing in both transmission and front axle was inadequate, and the car was underpowered, limited to a trifle over , inadequate even at the time, and readily exceeded by the less expensive Auburn. Still, the styling was lovely, and despite the wheelbase and steering demanding fully four turns lock-to-lock, handling was reportedly superb. Wheelbase was 137.5&quot; and the height of the sedan was 61&quot;. The 1930 Chrysler Imperial and Chrysler Eight copied several styling elements. 

The L-29 was priced around US$3,000 ($ in dollars ), putting it in the upper tier of America&#x27;s most expensive luxury automobiles alongside Cadillac, Marmon, Lincoln, Packard, Franklin, and Stutz, and below only Duesenburg. It could not, however, outrun the Great Depression, and by 1932, it was discontinued, with just 4,400 sold.

== Cord Model 810/812 ==

The Model 810/812 are probably the best-known of the company&#x27;s products. Styled by Gordon M. Buehrig, they featured front-wheel drive and independent front suspension. By placing the transmission ahead of the engine Buehrig was able to eliminate the driveshaft and transmission tunnel. Accentuating its sleek, low-slung look, he also dispensed with running boards. Powered by a Lycoming V8 of the same as the L-29&#x27;s straight-8, the 810 had a four-speed electrically selected semi-automatic transmission,(called a pre-selector because you selected the gear and then stepped on the clutch) among other innovative features like roll up headlights.

The car caused a sensation at the New York Auto Show in November 1935. Orders were taken at the show with Cord promising Christmas delivery, anticipating production of 1,000 per month. Delays pushed hoped delivery to February 1936 - which still proved optimistic, with owners only beginning to get the first cars in April. In all, Cord managed to sell only 1,174 of the new 810 in its first model year. The car&#x27;s distinctively squared-off front end and pioneering, streamlined, horizontally louvered grille design earned it the durable nickname &quot;coffin nose&quot;.

== Demise ==
Early reliability problems, including slipping out of gear and vapor lock, cooled initial enthusiasm, and the dealer base shrank rapidly. Unsold left-over and in-process 1936 810s were re-numbered and sold as 1937 812s. In 1937, Auburn ceased production of the Cord. A single 1938 Cord prototype with some changes to the grille and transmission cover was built, and it still exists (2015). The Cord empire, amid allegations of financial fraud, was sold to the Aviation Corporation, and E.L. Cord moved to Nevada where he earned millions in real estate and other enterprises.

==Hupmobile/Graham==

In 1940 ailing automakers Hupmobile and Graham-Paige tried to save money and revive the companies, by using the 810/812 body dies. Except for their similarity to the 810, their four-door sedans, the Hupp Skylark and the Graham Hollywood, were unremarkable. Retractable headlights gave way to plain headlight pods, and power came from a standard front-engine/rear-wheel drive design. While Hupp Motor Company built a few prototypes in 1939 that gained them sales orders for the 1939 model year they did not have the resources to manufacture the car. Graham Paige stepped in offering to build the Hupmobile Skylarks on a per piece contract basis. Graham built a combined 1850 units for sale in the 1940 model year. Hupmobile closed before the 1941 model came around. Of the 1850 cars produced in the 1940 model year by Graham only about 450 were the Hupmobile Skylarks. Graham continued to build the Hollywood late into 1941. They stopped production in November of that year having only built a rumored 400 units. The Hollywood was powered by a supercharged Continental in line six making 124 HP, almost 50 less than the original supercharged Cord.

== Post-bankruptcy ==

=== Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg (1938-1960) ===
In 1938, the assets of the ailing Auburn Automobile Company were purchased by Detroit entrepreneur Dallas E. Winslow, who renamed the company to the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg Company (ACD Co.) and began operating as a parts supplier for Auburn cars. ACD Co. also offered service and restoration work at the former Auburn factory, using the skills and expertise of former employees. Following the Second World War, Winslow would sell rights to the Duesenberg brand but retained Auburn and Cord.

=== Glenn Pray replicas (1960-1966) ===
In 1960, the rights to the Auburn-Cord name were purchased from Winslow by school shop teacher Glenn Pray, with financial backing from Chevrolet dealer Wayne McKinley. Feeling he could make money selling spare parts to fellow enthusiasts (many of whom he knew personally), Pray firstly used the newly formed company to sell such parts, before moving on to replica automobile production.

In 1964, Prays company began manufacturing the Cord 8/10, so named because it was an 8/10 scale replica of the original Cord 810. Designed with the assistance of Gordon Buehrig, the car was based on the drivetrain of a rear-engine Chevrolet Corvair, albeit rotated around, allowing the new Cord to be front-wheel-drive. The body was constructed from a plastic known as Royalite, through a partnership with U.S Rubber who were looking for a way to promote their new composite material.

With investors taking an active role in managing the company, the 8/10 was put into production before Pray believed it was ready. Pray refused to comply with investors in providing an account of parts used in the manufacture of the 8/10, and was ousted from the company in January of 1966. The company later went bankrupt in July 1966, after which 97 cars were built. Following the bankruptcy, Pray would later go on to produce Auburn replicas in a similar fashion.

=== Cancelled revival ===
Following Prays death in 2011, the rights to the Cord brand name were auctioned by the Pray family in 2014 and purchased by American entrepreneur Craig Corbell, who planned to revive the company using the Low Volume Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Act of 2015. Corbell intended to begin production with the Cord Model III, a luxury reverse-trike featuring a 180-horsepower V4 motorcycle engine from Motus Motorcycles, before moving on to a more conventional four-wheeled replica resembling the Cord 810/812 models, albeit incorporating modern design and technology. Corbell later cancelled the project however, and the rights to the Cord name were offered for auction again in 2019.

==Trivia==

The plot of the David Niven movie &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot; features a rare Cord convertible as the incentive for the hero to undertake an espionage mission. The movie was based on the James Leasor novel &quot;Passport to Oblivion&quot;, which is one of a series of suspense/intrigue novels featuring the fictitious Dr. Jason Love, whose &quot;infatuation&quot; with the Cord roadster played a prominent part.

In the novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Felix Leiter drives a Cord of unspecified model when he and James Bond are in Florida.

The original design for the Batmobile was a red convertible based on the Cord 812, which Batman creator Bob Kane considered one of his favorite vehicles and fitting for the millionaire vigilante.

The 1965 film &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; featured a rather battered red Cord 810 convertible with French selective yellow headlights. The car was piloted in several scenes by Woody Allen whose character drove on the Paris pavements (sidewalks).

A yellow Cord 810 is seen driven by young gangster Bobby Malto in the 1991 TV-Movie &quot;The Return of Eliot Ness&quot;, which starred Robert Stack, reprising his title role from &quot;The Untouchables&quot; 1959-1963 TV series.

In the 1994 film &quot;The Shadow&quot;, Moses Shrevnitz (Peter Boyle) drives a 1936 Cord 810 Westchester that was stretched and custom-painted as a taxi cab.

&quot;bePUZZLED&quot; brand puzzles is a series of puzzles which feature a short mystery story to go along with the picture in the assembled puzzle. A puzzle and story in the series is called A Classic Case of Murder and features a creme colored 1936 810 Cord in the story and pictured in the puzzle. Copyright 1992.

In the 2001 PlayStation exclusive car combat game Twisted Metal: Black. The playable driver No-Face has a car based on the Cord 810,
nicknamed &quot;Crazy 8&quot;.

In the 2002 PC and PlayStation 2 game the Cord 810 and 812 are featured under a cover-up names Thor 810 and Thor 812 FWD. The Thor 810 is based on the normally aspirated version with no outside exhaust, while the Thor 812 FWD, available only as a convertible in the game, is based on the supercharged version with the outside exhausts on the side of the engine bay. The player could even feel the car being front wheel drive, as the game featured sophisticated physical model of all cars (and guns for that matter) and so the Thor handled differently than the other rear driven cars. In the 2020 remake of the game, only one version is featured under the name Berkeley 810 and is derived from the two door supercharged version with a solid roof. 

As part of his series Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage in 2013, Jay featured his own Cord 812 which he had previously written about in Popular Mechanics. The car had been lovingly restored by amateur restorer Arthur Pirre.

On Gram Parsons&#x27; 1973 album &quot;GP&quot;, the song &quot;The New Soft Shoe&quot; is written about E.L Cord and his famous automobiles.

In classic crime film The Godfather, a Cord 810 convertible is briefly seen on the estate of Jack Woltz.

A 1930 Cord L-29 is featured prominently in HBO&#x27;s 2011 Mildred Pierce (miniseries).

Some sung versions of Rodgers and Hart song &quot;The Lady is a Tramp&quot; refer to &quot;Lincolns and Cords&quot;

<text>An ultramicroscope is a microscope with a system that lights the object in a way that allows viewing of tiny particles via light scattering, and not light reflection or absorption. When the diameter of a particle is below or near the wavelength of visible light (around 500 nanometers), the particle cannot be seen in a light microscope with the usual methods of illumination. The &quot;ultra-&quot; in &quot;ultramicroscope&quot; refers to the ability to see objects whose diameter is shorter than the wavelength of visible light, on the model of the &quot;ultra-&quot; in &quot;ultraviolet&quot;.

==Synopsis==
In the system, the particles to be observed are dispersed in a liquid or gas colloid (or less often in a coarser suspension). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a &quot;Tyndall cone&quot;. The scene is viewed through an ordinary microscope placed at right angles to the direction of the lightbeam. Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection. The particles are in Brownian motion in most kinds of liquid and gas colloids, which causes the movement of the spots. The ultramicroscope system can also be used to observe tiny nontransparent particles dispersed in a transparent solid or gel.

Ultramicroscopes have been used for general observation of aerosols and colloids, in studying Brownian motion, in observing ionization tracks in cloud chambers, and in studying biological ultrastructure.

==History==
In 1902, the ultramicroscope was developed by Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (1865–1929) and Henry Siedentopf (1872–1940), working for Carl Zeiss AG. Applying bright sunlight for illumination they were able to determine the size of 4 nm small nanoparticles in cranberry glass. Zsigmondy further improved the ultramicroscope and presented the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912, allowing the observation of suspended nanoparticles in defined fluidic volumes. In 1925, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on colloids and the ultramicroscope.

Later the development of electron microscopes provided additional ways to see objects too small for light microscopy.

<doc id="254294" wikidata="Q484456" url="?curid=254294" title="Anacoluthon">
<text>An anacoluthon (; from the Greek , from &#x27;not&#x27;, and &#x27;following&#x27;) is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical or grammatical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption. As rhetorical or literary device, anacoluthon may be used to demonstrate emotion or the natural patterns of spoken discourse.

An example is the Italian proverb &quot;The good stuff – think about it.&quot; This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally, it is considered to be an error in sentence structure and may result in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used intentionally as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in stream-of-consciousness literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought.

Anacolutha are very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, an em dash (—) or ellipsis is often included at the point of discontinuity. The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.

==Examples==
In &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, John Milton uses an anacoluthon with Satan&#x27;s first words to illustrate his initial confusion:

Additionally, Conrad Aiken&#x27;s &quot;Rimbaud and Verlaine&quot; has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
==Etymology==
The word &quot;anacoluthon&quot; is a transliteration of the Greek (), which derives from the privative prefix &#x27;not&#x27;, and the root adjective &#x27;following&#x27;. This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase in logic. However, in classical rhetoric, anacoluthon was used for the logical error of and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==
The term &quot;anacoluthon&quot; is used primarily within an academic context. It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry. For example, the 3rd edition of &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot;, a style guide written by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler, mentions it as a major grammatical mistake:

The word, though not the underlying meaning , has been somewhat popularized due to its use as an expletive by Captain Haddock in the English translations of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; series of children&#x27;s books.

The poet and critic Rachel Blau DuPlessis defines anacoluthon as &quot;the grammatical switching of horses in midstream of a sentence: beginning a sentence in one grammar and ending it in another&quot;. She argues that it involves &quot;the employing of multiple discursive ranges and disjunctive transpositions from one to the other[,] hence in any one poem, far from being in one mode, one register, one stable voice, a writer is like an acrobat ... a Barthesean weaver of a wacky fabric, or someone who &#x27;samples&#x27;, like a certain kind of contemporary DJ&quot;.

<doc id="254295" wikidata="Q367780" url="?curid=254295" title="Hamina">
<text>Hamina (; , , ) is a town and a municipality of Finland. It is located approximately east of the country&#x27;s capital Helsinki, in the Kymenlaakso region, and formerly the province of Southern Finland. The municipality&#x27;s population is (as of ) and covers an area of , of which 
is water. The population density is
. The population of the central town is approximately 10,000. The municipal language of Hamina is Finnish.

Highway 7 (E18) is the town&#x27;s road connection to Helsinki, after it was upgraded to a continuous motorway in September 2014. Hamina is also the base of one of the most important harbors of Finland, the Port of Hamina-Kotka. The port specializes in forest products and the transit of cargo to Russia. One of Google&#x27;s five European data centers is situated in Hamina.

==History==
Vehkalahti was as a municipality first mentioned in 1336. At the proposal of Count Per Brahe, the area surrounding the Vehkalahti church (today St. Mary&#x27;s Church) received its charter in 1653 through the establishment of Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki (Veckelax Nystad in Swedish, &quot;The New Town of Vehkalahti&quot;). The town was later destroyed during the Great Northern War in 1712.

As the commercially vibrant city of Vyborg was lost to Russia in 1721, Fredrikshamn (named in 1723 in the honor of King Frederick I of Sweden) was dedicated to replace it. The town, hitherto a small domestic port with restricted trading privilege&#x27;s, was granted extensive rights to conduct foreign trade. The Finnish speaking population soon abbreviated the name of the town to Hamina. The reconstruction of the town was completed between 1722 and 1724. The star-shaped fortress and the circular town plan, designed by Axel Löwen, were based on Central European and Italian Renaissance concepts from the 16th century. Fortress towns with a circular street plan like this are quite rare; one example is Palmanova in Italy.

In 1743, Hamina was surrendered to Russia, after the Russo–Swedish War, 1741–1743, and the town of Loviisa was the next Swedish candidate for an Eastern-Finnish trade center. Hamina became a Russian frontier town, for which a fortress was desirable.

The Treaty of Fredrikshamn (1809), by which Sweden ceded Finland, including parts of the province of Lappland and Åland, was signed in Hamina. Thus Sweden was split, and the eastern half was formed into the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. In 1812, the previously conquered territories known as Old Finland (including Hamina) were joined to the Grand Duchy.

Hamina Cadet School was founded in 1819 and was in operation until 1903. In 1920 the Reserve Officer School began in the same facilities.

Because the town was founded next to the Vehkalahti Church, the municipal center had always been inside the town borders. Vehkalahti and Hamina were consolidated in 2003, and the old coat of arms was replaced with Vehkalahti&#x27;s coat of arms. The old coat of arms was readopted in January 2013.

Results of the 2021 Finnish municipal elections, resulted in The Finns Party being the largest group on Hamina council, in Hamina.

== Main sights ==
* Town Hall: Originally built in 1798, it was renovated by Carl Ludvig Engel in 1840.
* Reserve Officer School: The site which trains reserve officers in the Army Academy of the Finnish Army
* Town Museum: It is located in a building where King Gustav III of Sweden and Empress Catherine II of Russia met in 1783.
* Shopkeeper&#x27;s Museum
* Google Data Center: (former Stora Enso pulp factory)
* Hamina Fortress: Built in the 18th century, it is one of the star forts in Finland. The corners of the fortress form six bastions, named after towns in Finland. The Central Bastion was added at the end of the 18th century, and is currently used for cultural events.

=== Churches ===
*St. Mary&#x27;s Church, previously known as Vehkalahti Church, is the oldest building in Kymenlaakso. It was originally built in the Middle Ages, but it was burnt in 1821 and the current neoclassical exterior is designed by Carl Ludvig Engel and completed in 1828. The church has a museum dedicated to the church life from the 18th century onwards.
*St. John&#x27;s Church, formerly known as Hamina Church, was built between 1841-1843. It was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel in the neoclassical style.
*Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Orthodox church in Hamina, was built in 1837. It was designed by Italian-French architect Louis Visconti. The architecture of the church is combination of neoclassical and Byzantine elements.

<text>The Treaty of Fredrikshamn (; ), or the Treaty of Hamina (), was a peace treaty concluded between Sweden and Imperial Russia on 17 September 1809. The treaty concluded the Finnish War and was signed in the Finnish town of Hamina (). Russia was represented by Nikolay Rumyantsev and David Alopaeus (Russian ambassador to Stockholm), while Sweden by Infantry General Kurt von Stedingk (former Swedish ambassador to Petersburg) and Colonel Anders Fredrik Skjöldebrand.

In the treaty, Sweden ceded Finnish territories to Russia.

==Terms==
According to the treaty Sweden ceded parts of the provinces Lappland and Västerbotten (east of Tornio River and Muonio River), Åland, and all provinces east thereof. The ceded territories came to constitute the Grand Duchy of Finland, to which also the Russian 18th century conquests of parts of Karelia and Savonia (later to be called &quot;Old Finland&quot;), were joined in 1812 as Viborg County. Together with the Diet of Porvoo (1809), and the Oath of the Sovereign, the Treaty of Fredrikshamn constitutes the cornerstone for the autonomous Grand Duchy, its own administration and institutions, and thereby a start of the development which would lead to the revival of Finnish culture, to equal position of the Finnish language, and ultimately in 1917 to Finland&#x27;s independence.

A reference to Emperor Alexander&#x27;s promise to retain old laws and privileges in Finland was included, but the treaty overstepped any formal guarantees of the legal position of Finland&#x27;s inhabitants. The Russians refused, and the Swedes were not in a position to insist. Similar clauses had been common in peace treaties, but they were also regularly circumvented. At the period of Russification of Finland, 90 years later, the Russian government argued that the treaty was not violated and hence no outside party had any right to intervene, the question being solely a matter of the Emperor who had granted the original promise. 

During the negotiations, Swedish representatives had namely endeavoured to escape the loss of the Åland islands, &quot;the fore-posts of Stockholm,&quot; as Napoleon rightly described them. The Åland islands were culturally, ethnically and linguistically purely Swedish, but such facts were of no significance at that time. In the course of the 19th century, it would also turn out that the Åland islands were a British interest, which, after the Crimean War, led to the demilitarization of the islands according to the Åland Convention included in the Treaty of Paris (1856). During the War of the Sixth Coalition, Russia and Sweden concluded an alliance directed against France (5 April 1812). They planned to effect a landing in Swedish Pomerania, which had been overrun by the French. Russia promised to press Denmark into ceding Norway to Sweden. It was understood that the United Kingdom would join the treaty too, but that never came to pass. Other plans failed to materialise due to Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia.
