<text>Nasdaq Helsinki, formerly known as the Helsinki Stock Exchange (, ), is a stock exchange located in Helsinki, Finland. Since 3 September 2003, it has been part of Nasdaq Nordic (previously called &quot;OMX&quot;). After the OMX merger, it was referred to as &quot;OMX Helsinki&quot; (OMXH), then after NASDAQ&#x27;s acquisition of OMX in February 2008, &quot;NASDAQ OMX Helsinki&quot;, and currently Nasdaq Helsinki.

== History ==

The Helsinki Stock Exchange saw its first transaction on October 7, 1912. From then it remained a &quot;free form&quot; financial association until in 1984 it was converted into a cooperative owned mostly by banks, traders, other companies and associations.

On April 1, 1990, trading was moved to a new digital system: HETI (Helsinki Stock Exchange Automated Trading and Information System, and in Finnish a rough backronym for &quot;immediately&quot;), which replaced the electro-mechanical trading system originally introduced back in 1935. HETI enabled remote traders to conduct transactions on equal terms with those in the trading room.

The cooperative changed to a limited liability company (&quot;Helsingin Arvopaperipörssi&quot;) in the fall of 1995 and merged with several clearing and stock deposit companies and associations at the beginning of 1997. During 1997 and 1998 the Stock Exchange bought both of the Finnish derivative exchanges and merged them with itself to become &quot;HEX&quot;. In November 1998 HEX merged with Arvopaperikeskus to form Helsinki Exchanges Group Plc, which then changed its name to HEX Plc in the spring of 2001. In 2001 and 2002 HEX acquired a majority share of the Tallinn Stock Exchange and the Riga Stock Exchange.

On 3 September 2003, HEX Plc merged with OM AB, owner of the Stockholm Stock Exchange, to become OM HEX. A year later, the company was renamed to OMX.

OMX Helsinki 25 (OMXH25) is the leading share index on Nasdaq Helsinki. It is a market value weighted index that consists of the 25 most-traded on Nasdaq Helsinki. OMXH25 was earlier known by its old name, HEX25.

==Hours==
Normal trading sessions are from 10:00am to 6:30pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.

<text>A swept wing is a wing angled either backward or occasionally forward from its root rather than perpendicular to the fuselage.

Swept wings have been flown since the pioneer days of aviation. Wing sweep at high speeds was first investigated in Germany as early as 1935 by Albert Betz and Adolph Busemann, finding application just before the end of the Second World War. It has the effect of delaying the shock waves and accompanying aerodynamic drag rise caused by fluid compressibility near the speed of sound, improving performance. Swept wings are therefore almost always used on jet aircraft designed to fly at these speeds.

The term &quot;swept wing&quot; is normally used to mean &quot;swept back&quot;, but variants include forward sweep, variable sweep wings and oblique wings in which one side sweeps forward and the other back. The delta wing is also aerodynamically a form of swept wing.

==Reasons for sweep==

There are three main reasons for sweeping a wing:

1. to arrange the center of gravity of the aircraft and the aerodynamic center of the wing to coincide more closely for longitudinal balance, e.g. Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and Messerschmitt Me 262. Although not a swept wing the wing panels on the Douglas DC-1 outboard of the nacelles also had slight sweepback for similar reasons.

2. to provide longitudinal stability for tailless aircraft, e.g. Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet.

3. most commonly to increase Mach-number capability by delaying to a higher speed the effects of compressibility (abrupt changes in the density of the airflow), e.g. combat aircraft, airliners and business jets.

Other reasons include:

1. enabling a wing carry-through box position to achieve a desired cabin size, e.g. HFB 320 Hansa Jet.

2. providing static aeroelastic relief which reduces bending moments under high g-loadings and may allow a lighter wing structure.

==Structural design==

For a wing of given span, sweeping it increases the length of the spars running along it from root to tip. This tends to increase weight and reduce stiffness. If the fore-aft chord of the wing also remains the same, the distance between leading and trailing edges reduces, reducing its ability to resist twisting (torsion) forces. A swept wing of given span and chord must therefore be strengthened and will be heavier than the equivalent unswept wing.

A swept wing typically angles backward from its root rather than forwards. Because wings are made as light as possible, they tend to flex under load. This aeroelasticity under aerodynamic load causes the tips to bend upwards in normal flight. Backwards sweep causes the tips to reduce their angle of attack as they bend, reducing their lift and limiting the effect. Forward sweep causes the tips to increase their angle of attack as they bend. This increases their lift causing further bending and hence yet more lift in a cycle which can cause a runaway structural failure. For this reason forward sweep is rare and the wing must be unusually rigid.

There are two sweep angles of importance, one at the leading edge for supersonic aircraft and the other 25% of the way back from the leading edge for subsonic and transonic aircraft. Leading edge sweep is important because the leading edge has to be behind the mach cone to reduce wave drag. The quarter chord (25%) line is used because subsonic lift due to angle of attack acts there and, up until the introduction of supercritical sections, the crest was usually close to the quarter chord.

Typical sweep angles vary from 0 for a straight-wing aircraft, to 45 degrees or more for fighters and other high-speed designs.

==Aerodynamic design==

===Subsonic and transonic flight===

Shock waves can form on some parts of an aircraft moving at less than the speed of sound. Low-pressure regions around an aircraft cause the flow to accelerate, and at transonic speeds this local acceleration can exceed Mach 1. Localized supersonic flow must return to the freestream conditions around the rest of the aircraft, and as the flow enters an adverse pressure gradient in the aft section of the wing, a discontinuity emerges in the form of a shock wave as the air is forced to rapidly slow and return to ambient pressure.

At the point where the density drops, the local speed of sound correspondingly drops and a shock wave can form. This is why in conventional wings, shock waves form first &quot;after&quot; the maximum Thickness/Chord and why all airliners designed for cruising in the transonic range (above M0.8) have supercritical wings that are flatter on top, resulting in minimized angular change of flow to upper surface air. The angular change to the air that is normally part of lift generation is decreased and this lift reduction is compensated for by deeper curved lower surfaces accompanied by a reflex curve at the trailing edge. This results in a much weaker shock wave towards the rear of the upper wing surface and a corresponding &quot;increase&quot; in critical mach number.

Shock waves require energy to form. This energy is taken out of the aircraft, which has to supply extra thrust to make up for this energy loss. Thus the shocks are seen as a form of drag. Since the shocks form when the local air velocity reaches supersonic speeds, there is a certain &quot;critical mach&quot; speed where sonic flow first appears on the wing. There is a following point called the drag divergence mach number where the effect of the drag from the shocks becomes noticeable. This is normally when the shocks start generating over the wing, which on most aircraft is the largest continually curved surface, and therefore the largest contributor to this effect.

Sweeping the wing has the effect of reducing the curvature of the body as seen from the airflow, by the cosine of the angle of sweep. For instance, a wing with a 45 degree sweep will see a reduction in effective curvature to about 70% of its straight-wing value. This has the effect of increasing the critical Mach by 30%. When applied to large areas of the aircraft, like the wings and empennage, this allows the aircraft to reach speeds closer to Mach 1.

One limiting factor in swept wing design is the so-called &quot;middle effect&quot;. If a swept wing is continuous - an oblique swept wing - the pressure isobars will be swept at a continuous angle from tip to tip. However, if the left and right halves are swept back equally, as is common practice, the pressure isobars on the left wing in theory will meet the pressure isobars of the right wing on the centerline at a large angle. As the isobars cannot meet in such a fashion, they will tend to curve on each side as they near the centerline, so that the isobars cross the centerline at right angles to the centerline. This causes an &quot;unsweeping&quot; of the isobars in the wing root region. To combat this unsweeping, German aerodynamicist Dietrich Küchemann proposed and had tested a local indentation of the fuselage above and below the wing root. This proved to not be very effective. During the development of the Douglas DC-8 airliner, uncambered airfoils were used in the wing root area to combat the unsweeping.

===Supersonic flight===
Swept wings on supersonic aircraft usually lie within the cone-shaped shock wave produced at the nose of the aircraft so they will &quot;see&quot; subsonic airflow and work as subsonic wings. The angle needed to lie behind the cone increases with increasing speed, at Mach 1.3 the angle is about 45 degrees, at Mach 2.0 it is 60 degrees. The angle of the Mach cone formed off the body of the aircraft will be at about sin μ = 1/M (μ is the sweep angle of the Mach cone).

=== Disadvantages ===
When a swept wing travels at high speed, the airflow has little time to react and simply flows over the wing almost straight from front to back. At lower speeds the air &quot;does&quot; have time to react, and is pushed spanwise by the angled leading edge, towards the wing tip. At the wing root, by the fuselage, this has little noticeable effect, but as one moves towards the wingtip the airflow is pushed spanwise not only by the leading edge, but the spanwise moving air beside it. At the tip the airflow is moving along the wing instead of over it, a problem known as &quot;spanwise flow&quot;.

The lift from a wing is generated by the airflow over it from front to rear. With increasing span-wise flow the boundary layers on the surface of the wing have longer to travel, and so are thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation, also the effective aspect ratio of the wing is less and so air &quot;leaks&quot; around the wing tips reducing their effectiveness. The spanwise flow on swept wings produces airflow that moves the stagnation point on the leading edge of any individual wing segment further beneath the leading edge, increasing effective angle of attack of wing segments relative to its neighbouring forward segment. The result is that wing segments farther towards the rear operate at increasingly higher angles of attack promoting early stall of those segments. This promotes tip stall on back-swept wings, as the tips are most rearward, while delaying tip stall for forward-swept wings, where the tips are forward. With both forward and back-swept wings, the rear of the wing will stall first creating a nose-up moment on the aircraft. If not corrected by the pilot the plane will pitch up, leading to more of the wing stalling and more pitch up in a divergent manner. This uncontrollable instability came to be known as the &quot;Sabre dance&quot; in reference to the number of North American F-100 Super Sabres that crashed on landing as a result.

Reducing pitch-up to an acceptable level has been done in different ways such as the addition of a fin known as a &quot;wing fence&quot; on the upper surface of the wing to redirect the flow to a streamwise direction. The MiG-15 was one example of an aircraft fitted with wing fences. Another closely related design was the addition of a dogtooth notch to the leading edge, used on the Avro Arrow interceptor. Other designs took a more radical approach, including the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor&#x27;s wing that grew wider towards the tip to provide more lift at the tip. The Handley Page Victor was equipped with a crescent wing, with three values of sweep, about 48 degrees near the wing root where the wing was thickest, a 38 degree transition length and 27 degrees for the remainder to the tip.

Modern solutions to the problem no longer require &quot;custom&quot; designs such as these. The addition of leading-edge slats and large compound flaps to the wings has largely resolved the issue. On fighter designs, the addition of leading-edge extensions, which are typically included to achieve a high level of maneuverability, also serve to add lift during landing and reduce the problem.

In addition to pitch-up there are other complications inherent in a swept-wing configuration. For any given length of wing, the actual span from tip-to-tip is shorter than the same wing that is not swept. There is a strong correlation between low-speed drag and aspect ratio, the span compared to chord, so a swept wing always has more drag at lower speeds. In addition, there is extra torque applied by the wing to the fuselage which has to be allowed for when establishing the transfer of wing-box loads to the fuselage. This results from the significant part of the wing lift which lies behind the attachment length where the wing meets the fuselage.

===Sweep theory===
Sweep theory is an aeronautical engineering description of the behavior of airflow over a wing when the wing&#x27;s leading edge encounters the airflow at an oblique angle. The development of sweep theory resulted in the swept wing design used by most modern jet aircraft, as this design performs more effectively at transonic and supersonic speeds. In its advanced form, sweep theory led to the experimental oblique wing concept.

Adolf Busemann introduced the concept of the swept wing and presented this in 1935 at the Fifth Volta Conference in Rome. Sweep theory in general was a subject of development and investigation throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but the breakthrough mathematical definition of sweep theory is generally credited to NACA&#x27;s Robert T. Jones in 1945. Sweep theory builds on other wing lift theories. Lifting line theory describes lift generated by a straight wing (a wing in which the leading edge is perpendicular to the airflow). Weissinger theory describes the distribution of lift for a swept wing, but does not have the capability to include chordwise pressure distribution. There are other methods that do describe chordwise distributions, but they have other limitations. Jones&#x27; sweep theory provides a simple, comprehensive analysis of swept wing performance.

An explanation of how the swept wing works was offered by Robert T. Jones:
&quot;Assume a wing is a cylinder of uniform airfoil cross-section, chord and thickness and is placed in an airstream at an angle of yaw – i.e., it is swept back. Now, even if the local speed of the air on the upper surface of the wing becomes supersonic, a shock wave cannot form there because it would have to be a sweptback shock – swept at the same angle as the wing – i.e., it would be an oblique shock. Such an oblique shock cannot form until the velocity component normal to it becomes supersonic.&quot;

To visualize the basic concept of simple sweep theory, consider a straight, non-swept wing of infinite length, which meets the airflow at a perpendicular angle. The resulting air pressure distribution is equivalent to the length of the wing&#x27;s chord (the distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge). If we were to begin to slide the wing sideways (spanwise), the sideways motion of the wing relative to the air would be added to the previously perpendicular airflow, resulting in an airflow over the wing at an angle to the leading edge. This angle results in airflow traveling a greater distance from leading edge to trailing edge, and thus the air pressure is distributed over a greater distance (and consequently lessened at any particular point on the surface).

This scenario is identical to the airflow experienced by a swept wing as it travels through the air. The airflow over a swept wing encounters the wing at an angle. That angle can be broken down into two vectors, one perpendicular to the wing, and one parallel to the wing. The flow parallel to the wing has no effect on it, and since the perpendicular vector is shorter (meaning slower) than the actual airflow, it consequently exerts less pressure on the wing. In other words, the wing experiences airflow that is slower - and at lower pressures - than the actual speed of the aircraft.

One of the factors that must be taken into account when designing a high-speed wing is compressibility, which is the effect that acts upon a wing as it approaches and passes through the speed of sound. The significant negative effects of compressibility made it a prime issue with aeronautical engineers. Sweep theory helps mitigate the effects of compressibility in transonic and supersonic aircraft because of the reduced pressures. This allows the mach number of an aircraft to be higher than that actually experienced by the wing.

There is also a negative aspect to sweep theory. The lift produced by a wing is directly related to the speed of the air over the wing. Since the airflow speed experienced by a swept wing is lower than what the actual aircraft speed is, this becomes a problem during slow-flight phases, such as takeoff and landing. There have been various ways of addressing the problem, including the variable-incidence wing design on the Vought F-8 Crusader, and swing wings on aircraft such as the F-14, F-111, and the Panavia Tornado.

== Variant designs ==

The term &quot;swept wing&quot; is normally used to mean &quot;swept back&quot;, but other swept variants include forward sweep, variable sweep wings and oblique wings in which one side sweeps forward and the other back. The delta wing also incorporates the same advantages as part of its layout.

=== Forward sweep ===


Sweeping a wing forward has approximately the same effect as rearward in terms of drag reduction, but has other advantages in terms of low-speed handling where tip stall problems simply go away. In this case the low-speed air flows towards the fuselage, which acts as a very large wing fence. Additionally, wings are generally larger at the root anyway, which allows them to have better low-speed lift.

However, this arrangement also has serious stability problems. The rearmost section of the wing will stall first causing a pitch-up moment pushing the aircraft further into stall similar to a swept back wing design. Thus swept-forward wings are unstable in a fashion similar to the low-speed problems of a conventional swept wing. However unlike swept back wings, the tips on a forward swept design will stall last, maintaining roll control.

Forward-swept wings can also experience dangerous flexing effects compared to aft-swept wings that can negate the tip stall advantage if the wing is not sufficiently stiff. In aft-swept designs, when the airplane maneuvers at high load factor the wing loading and geometry twists the wing in such a way as to create washout (tip twists leading edge down). This reduces the angle of attack at the tip, thus reducing the bending moment on the wing, as well as somewhat reducing the chance of tip stall. However, the same effect on forward-swept wings produces a wash-in effect that increases the angle of attack promoting tip stall.

Small amounts of sweep do not cause serious problems, and had been used on a variety of aircraft to move the spar into a convenient location, as on the Junkers Ju 287 or HFB 320 Hansa Jet. However, larger sweep suitable for high-speed aircraft, like fighters, was generally impossible until the introduction of fly by wire systems that could react quickly enough to damp out these instabilities. The Grumman X-29 was an experimental technology demonstration project designed to test the forward swept wing for enhanced maneuverability during the 1980s. The Sukhoi Su-47 &quot;Berkut&quot; is another notable demonstrator aircraft implementing this technology to achieve high levels of agility. To date, no highly swept-forward design has entered production.

==History==

===Early history===
The first successful aeroplanes adhered to the basic design of rectangular wings at right angles to the body of the machine. Such a layout is inherently unstable; if the weight distribution of the aircraft changes even slightly, the wing will want to rotate so its front moves up (weight moving rearward) or down (forward) and this rotation will change the development of lift and cause it to move further in that direction. To make an aircraft stable, the normal solution is to place the weight at one end and offset this with an opposite downward force at the other - this leads to the classic layout with the engine in front and the control surfaces at the end of a long boom with the wing in the middle. This layout has long been known to be inefficient. The downward force of the control surfaces needs further lift from the wing to offset. The amount of force can be decreased by increasing the length of the boom, but this leads to more skin friction and weight of the boom itself.

This problem led to many experiments with different layouts that eliminates the need for the downward force. One such wing geometry appeared before World War I, which led to early swept wing designs. In this layout, the wing is swept so that portions lie far in front and in back of the center of gravity (CoG), with the control surfaces behind it. The result is a weight distribution similar to the classic layout, but the offsetting control force is no longer a separate surface but part of the wing, which would have existed anyway. This eliminates the need for separate structure, making the aircraft have less drag and require less total lift for the same level of performance. These layouts inspired several flying wing gliders and some powered aircraft during the interwar years.
The first to achieve stability was British designer J. W. Dunne who was obsessed with achieving inherent stability in flight. He successfully employed swept wings in his tailless aircraft (which, crucially, used washout) as a means of creating positive longitudinal static stability. For a low-speed aircraft, swept wings may be used to resolve problems with the center of gravity, to move the wing spar into a more convenient location, or to improve the sideways view from the pilot&#x27;s position. By 1905, Dunne had already built a model glider with swept wings followed by the powered Dunne D.5, and by 1913 he had constructed successful powered variants that were able to cross the English Channel. The Dunne D.5 was exceptionally aerodynamically stable for the time, and the D.8 was sold to the Royal Flying Corps; it was also manufactured under licence by Starling Burgess to the United States Navy amongst other customers.

Dunne&#x27;s work ceased with the onset of war in 1914, but afterwards the idea was taken up by G. T. R. Hill in England who designed a series of gliders and aircraft to Dunne&#x27;s guidelines, notably the Westland-Hill Pterodactyl series. However, Dunne&#x27;s theories met with little acceptance amongst the leading aircraft designers and aviation companies at the time.

===German developments===
The idea of using swept wings to reduce high-speed drag was developed in Germany in the 1930s. At a Volta Conference meeting in 1935 in Italy, Adolf Busemann suggested the use of swept wings for supersonic flight. He noted that the airspeed over the wing was dominated by the normal component of the airflow, not the freestream velocity, so by setting the wing at an angle the forward velocity at which the shock waves would form would be higher (the same had been noted by Max Munk in 1924, although not in the context of high-speed flight). Albert Betz immediately suggested the same effect would be equally useful in the transonic. After the presentation the host of the meeting, Arturo Crocco, jokingly sketched &quot;Busemann&#x27;s airplane of the future&quot; on the back of a menu while they all dined. Crocco&#x27;s sketch showed a classic 1950s fighter design, with swept wings and tail surfaces, although he also sketched a swept propeller powering it.

At the time, however, there was no way to power an aircraft to these sorts of speeds, and even the fastest aircraft of the era were only approaching .The presentation was largely of academic interest, and soon forgotten. Even notable attendees including Theodore von Kármán and Eastman Jacobs did not recall the presentation 10 years later when it was re-introduced to them.

Hubert Ludwieg of the High-Speed Aerodynamics Branch at the AVA Göttingen in 1939 conducted the first wind tunnel tests to investigate Busemann&#x27;s theory. Two wings, one with no sweep, and one with 45 degrees of sweep were tested at Mach numbers of 0.7 and 0.9 in the 11 x 13 cm wind tunnel. The results of these tests confirmed the drag reduction offered by swept wings at transonic speeds. The results of the tests were communicated to Albert Betz who then passed them on to Willy Messerschmitt in December 1939. The tests were expanded in 1940 to include wings with 15, 30 and -45 degrees of sweep and Mach numbers as high as 1.21.

With the introduction of jets in the later half of the Second World War, the swept wing became increasingly applicable to optimally satisfying aerodynamic needs. The German jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262 and rocket-powered Messerschmitt Me 163 suffered from compressibility effects that made both aircraft very difficult to control at high speeds. In addition, the speeds put them into the wave drag regime, and anything that could reduce this drag would increase the performance of their aircraft, notably the notoriously short flight times measured in minutes. This resulted in a crash program to introduce new swept wing designs, both for fighters as well as bombers. The Blohm &amp; Voss P 215 was designed to take full advantage of the swept wing&#x27;s aerodynamic properties; however, an order for three prototypes was received only weeks before the war ended and no examples were ever built. The Focke-Wulf Ta 183 was another swept wing fighter design, but was also not produced before the war&#x27;s end. In the post-war era, Kurt Tank developed the Ta 183 into the IAe Pulqui II, but this proved unsuccessful.

A prototype test aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me P.1101, was built to research the tradeoffs of the design and develop general rules about what angle of sweep to use. When it was 80% complete, the P.1101 was captured by US forces and returned to the United States, where two additional copies with US-built engines carried on the research as the Bell X-5. Germany&#x27;s wartime experience with the swept wings and its high value for supersonic flight stood in strong contrast to the prevailing views of Allied experts of the era, who commonly espoused their belief in the impossibility of manned vehicles travelling at such speeds.

===Postwar advancements===

During the immediate post-war era, several nations were conducting research into high speed aircraft. In the United Kingdom, work commenced during 1943 on the Miles M.52, a high-speed experimental aircraft equipped with a straight wing that was developed in conjunction with Frank Whittle&#x27;s Power Jets company, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough, and the National Physical Laboratory. The M.52 was envisioned to be capable of achieving in level flight, thus enabling the aircraft to potentially be the first to exceed the speed of sound in the world. In February 1946, the programme was abruptly discontinued for unclear reasons. It has since been widely recognised that the cancellation of the M.52 was a major setback in British progress in the field of supersonic design.

Another, more successful, programme was the US&#x27;s Bell X-1, which also was equipped with a straight wing. According to Miles Chief Aerodynamicist Dennis Bancroft, the Bell Aircraft company was given access to the drawings and research on the M.52. On 14 October 1947, the Bell X-1 performed the first manned supersonic flight, piloted by Captain Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager, having been drop launched from the bomb bay of a Boeing B-29 Superfortress and attained a record-breaking speed of Mach 1.06 (). The news of a successful straight-wing supersonic aircraft surprised many aeronautical experts on both sides of the Atlantic, as it was increasingly believed that a swept-wing design not only highly beneficial but also necessary to break the sound barrier.
During the final years of the Second World War, aircraft designer Sir Geoffrey de Havilland commenced development on the de Havilland Comet, which would become the world&#x27;s first jet airliner. An early design consideration was whether to apply the new swept-wing configuration. Thus, an experimental aircraft to explore the technology, the de Havilland DH 108, was developed by the firm in 1944, headed by project engineer John Carver Meadows Frost with a team of 8–10 draughtsmen and engineers. The DH 108 primarily consisted of the pairing of the front fuselage of the de Havilland Vampire to a swept wing and small vertical tail; it was the first British swept wing jet, unofficially known as the &quot;Swallow&quot;. It first flew on 15 May 1946, a mere eight months after the project&#x27;s go-ahead. Company test pilot and son of the builder, Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., flew the first of three aircraft and found it extremely fast – fast enough to try for a world speed record. On 12 April 1948, a D.H.108 did set a world&#x27;s speed record at 973.65 km/h (605 mph), it subsequently became the first jet aircraft to exceed the speed of sound.

Around this same timeframe, the Air Ministry introduced a program of experimental aircraft to examine the effects of swept wings, as well as the delta wing configuration. Furthermore, the Royal Air Force (RAF) identified a pair of proposed fighter aircraft equipped with swept wings from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine, the Hawker Hunter and Supermarine Swift respectively, and successfully pressed for orders to be placed &#x27;off the drawing board&#x27; in 1950. On 7 September 1953, the sole Hunter Mk 3 (the modified first prototype, &quot;WB 188&quot;) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for jet-powered aircraft, attaining a speed of 727.63 mph (1,171.01 km/h) over Littlehampton, West Sussex. This world record stood for less than three weeks before being broken on 25 September 1953 by the Hunter&#x27;s early rival, the Supermarine Swift, being flown by Michael Lithgow.

In February 1945, NACA engineer Robert T. Jones started looking at highly swept delta wings and V shapes, and discovered the same effects as Busemann. He finished a detailed report on the concept in April, but found his work was heavily criticised by other members of NACA Langley, notably Theodore Theodorsen, who referred to it as &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; and demanded some &quot;real mathematics&quot;. However, Jones had already secured some time for free-flight models under the direction of Robert Gilruth, whose reports were presented at the end of May and showed a fourfold decrease in drag at high speeds. All of this was compiled into a report published on June 21, 1945, which was sent out to the industry three weeks later. Ironically, by this point Busemann&#x27;s work had already been passed around.
In May 1945, the American Operation Paperclip reached Braunschweig, where US personnel discovered a number of swept wing models and a mass of technical data from the wind tunnels. One member of the US team was George S. Schairer, who was at that time working at the Boeing company. He immediately forwarded a letter to Ben Cohn at Boeing, communicating the value of the swept wing concept. He also told Cohn to distribute the letter to other companies as well, although only Boeing and North American made immediate use of it.

Boeing was in the midst of designing the B-47 Stratojet, and the initial Model 424 was a straight-wing design similar to the B-45, B-46 and B-48 it competed with. Analysis by Boeing engineer Vic Ganzer suggested an optimum sweepback angle of about 35 degrees. By September 1945, the Braunschweig data had been worked into the design, which re-emerged as the Model 448, a larger six-engine design with more robust wings swept at 35 degrees. Another re-work moved the engines into strut-mounted pods under the wings due to concerns of the uncontained failure of an internal engine could potentially destroy the aircraft via either fire or vibration. The resulting B-47 was hailed as the fastest of its class in the world during the late 1940s, and trounced the straight-winged competition. Boeing&#x27;s jet-transport formula of swept wings and pylon-mounted engines has since been universally adopted.

In fighters, North American Aviation was in the midst of working on a straight-wing jet-powered naval fighter, then known as the FJ-1; it was later submitted to the United States Air Force as the XP-86. Larry Green, who could read German, studied the Busemann reports and convinced management to allow a redesign starting in August 1945. The performance of the F-86A allowed it to set the first of several official world speed records, attaining on 15 September 1948, flown by Major Richard L. Johnson. With the appearance of the MiG-15, the F-86 was rushed into combat, while straight-wing jets like the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and Republic F-84 Thunderjet were quickly relegated to ground attack missions. Some, such as the F-84 and Grumman F-9 Cougar, were later redesigned with swept wings from straight-winged aircraft. Later planes, such as the North American F-100 Super Sabre, would be designed with swept wings from the start, though additional innovations such as the afterburner, area-rule and new control surfaces would be necessary to master supersonic flight.
The Soviet Union was also quick to investigate the advantages of swept wings on high speed aircraft, when their &quot;captured aviation technology&quot; counterparts to the western Allies spread out across the defeated Third Reich. Artem Mikoyan was asked by the Soviet government&#x27;s TsAGI aviation research department to develop a test-bed aircraft to research the swept wing idea — the result was the late 1945-flown, unusual MiG-8 &quot;Utka&quot; pusher canard layout aircraft, with its rearwards-located wings being swept back for this type of research. The swept wing was applied to the MiG-15, an early jet-powered fighter, its maximum speed of outclassed the straight-winged American jets and piston-engined fighters initially deployed during the Korean War. The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the most produced jet aircraft; in excess of 13,000 would ultimately be manufactured.

The MiG-15, which could not safely exceed Mach 0.92, served as the basis for the MiG-17, which was designed to be controllable at higher Mach numbers. Its wing sweep, 45° near the fuselage ( the same as the F-100 Super Sabre), changed to 42° for the outboard part of the wing. A further derivative of the design, designated MiG-19, featured a relatively thin wing suited to supersonic flight that was designed at TsAGI, the Soviet Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute; swept back at an angle of 55 degrees, this wing featured a single wing fence on each side. A specialist high-altitude variant, the Mig-19SV, featured, amongst other changes, an adjustable flap to generate greater lift at higher altitudes, helping to increase the aircraft&#x27;s ceiling from to .

Germany&#x27;s swept wing research was also obtained by the Swedish aircraft manufacturer SAAB, with the help of ex-Messerschmitt engineers that had fled to Switzerland during late 1945. At the time, SAAB saw the need to make aeronautical advances, particularly in the new field of jet propulsion. The company incorporated both the jet engine and the swept wing to produce the Saab 29 Tunnan fighter; on 1 September 1948, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, flown by the English test pilot S/L Robert A. &#x27;Bob&#x27; Moore, DFC and bar, Although not well known outside Sweden, the Tunnan was the first Western European fighter to be introduced with such a wing configuration. In parallel, SAAB also developed another swept wing aircraft, the Saab 32 Lansen, primarily to serve as Sweden&#x27;s standard attack aircraft. Its wing, which had a 10 per cent laminar profile and a 35° sweep, featured triangular fences near the wing roots in order to improve airflow when the aircraft was being flown at a high angle of attack. On 25 October 1953, a SAAB 32 Lansen attained a Mach number of at least 1.12 while in a shallow dive, exceeding the sound barrier.

The successes of aircraft such as the Hawker Hunter, the B-47, and F-86 showed the value of the swept wing research acquired from Germany. Eventually, almost all advanced design efforts for high speed aircraft would incorporate a wing with a swept leading edge, with either a swept wing or delta wing planform. The Boeing B-52, designed in the 1950s, continues in service as a subsonic long-range heavy bomber. While the Soviets never matched the performance of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress with a jet aircraft, the intercontinental range Tupolev Tu-95 turboprop bomber with its near-jet class top speed of 920 km/h, combining swept wings with propeller propulsion, also remains in service today, being the fastest propeller-powered production aircraft. In Britain, two swept-wing bombers entered service, the Vickers Valiant (1955) and the Handley Page Victor (1958).

By the early 1950s, nearly every new fighter had a swept wing. By the 1960s, most civilian jets also adopted swept wings. Most early transonic and supersonic designs such as the MiG-19 and F-100 used long, highly swept wings. Swept wings would reach Mach 2 on the BAC Lightning, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief, built to operate at low level and very high speed primarily for nuclear strike, but with a secondary air-to-air capability. By the late 1960s, the McDonnell F-4 Phantom II, was used in large numbers by air forces influenced by the United States. Variable geometry wings were employed on the American F-111, Grumman F-14 Tomcat and Soviet Mikoyan MiG-27, although the idea would be abandoned for the American SST design. After the 1970s, most newer generation fighters optimized for maneuvering air combat since the USAF F-15 and Soviet Mikoyan MiG-29 have employed relatively short-span fixed wings with relatively large wing area.

<text>Artabasdos or Artavasdos ( or , from , , ), Latinized as Artabasdus, was a Byzantine general of Armenian descent who seized the throne from June 741 until November 743, in usurpation of the reign of Constantine V.

== Rise to power ==
In about 713, Emperor Anastasius II appointed Artabasdos as governor (&quot;stratēgos&quot;) of the Armeniac Theme (Θέμα Άρμενιάκων, &quot;Thema Armeniakōn&quot;), the successor of the Army of Armenia, which occupied the old areas of the Pontus, Armenia Minor, and northern Cappadocia, with its capital at Amasea. After Anastasius&#x27; fall, Artabasdos made an agreement with his colleague Leo, the governor of the Anatolic Theme, to overthrow the new Emperor Theodosius III. This agreement was sealed with the engagement of Leo&#x27;s daughter Anna to Artabasdos, and the marriage took place after Leo III ascended the throne in March 717.

Artabasdos was awarded the rank of &quot;kouropalates&quot; (&quot;master of the palace&quot;) and became commander (count, &quot;komēs&quot;) of the Opsikion Theme, while retaining control of his original command. In June 741, after the accession of Leo&#x27;s son Constantine V to the throne, Artabasdos resolved to seize the throne and attacked his brother-in-law while the latter was traversing Asia Minor to fight the Arabs on the eastern frontier. While Constantine fled to Amorion, Artabasdus seized Constantinople amid popular support and was crowned emperor in the summer of 742.

== Reign and downfall ==
While according to Theophanes the Confessor and Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, Artabasdos abandoned his predecessor&#x27;s religious policy of iconoclasm and authorised the cult of images with some support, there is actually little support from contemporary sources. Soon after his accession, Artabasdus crowned his wife Anna as &quot;augusta&quot; and his son Nikephoros as co-emperor, while putting his other son Niketas in charge of the Armeniac Theme. Artabasdos was supported by the themes of Opsikion and Thrace along with the Armeniacs, while Constantine was supported by the fleet of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme and the armies of the Anatolic and Thracesian themes.

The inevitable clash came in May 743, when Artabasdos led the offensive against Constantine but was defeated. Later the same year Constantine defeated Niketas, and on 2 November 744, Artabasdus&#x27; reign came to an end as Constantine V entered Constantinople. Artabasdos, accompanied by his close associate Baktangios fled to the castle of Pouzanes in Opsikion (Asia Minor), where they were apprehended and brought to Constantinople. Artabasdos and his sons were publicly blinded and relegated to the Chora Monastery on the outskirts of Constantinople.

==Family==
By his wife Anna, the daughter of Emperor Leo III, Artabasdos had nine children, including:
* Nikephoros, made co-emperor by his father.
* Niketas, who was &quot;strategos&quot; of the Armeniac theme

<text>The Ruhr University Bochum (, ) is a public research university located in the southern hills of the central Ruhr area, Bochum, Germany. It was founded in 1962 as the first new public university in Germany after World War II. Instruction began in 1965.

The Ruhr-University Bochum is one of the largest universities in Germany and part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the most important German research funding organization.

The RUB was very successful in the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments (2007), a competition between Germany&#x27;s most prestigious universities. It was one of the few institutions left competing for the title of an &quot;elite university&quot;, but did not succeed in the last round. There are currently nine universities in Germany that hold this title.

The University of Bochum was one of the first universities in Germany to introduce international bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, which replaced the traditional German Diplom and Magister. Except for a few special cases, such as law, these degrees are offered by all faculties of the Ruhr-University. Currently, the university offers a total of 184 different study programs from all academic fields represented at the university.

==Facilities==
Unlike many older German universities, the buildings of Ruhr-University are all centralized on one campus, located south of Bochum city. The Faculty of Medicine includes several university clinics that are located at different centres in Bochum and the Ruhr area. A major facility for patient care is the University Hospital/Knappschaftskrankenhaus in the district Langendreer of Bochum. Internationally renowned experts in their respective fields include professors Wolff Schmiegel in oncology and Burkhard Dick in ophthalmology. The centralized university campus architecture is comprised almost exclusively of the 1960s architecture style referred to as brutalism, consisting of 14 almost identical high-rise buildings. One striking feature of these buildings is that although their roofs are all at the same apparent height (sky level), the absolute heights of the buildings vary in accordance with their placement on the undulating landscape in which the university is located: the campus is at the edge of a green belt on high ground adjacent to the Ruhr valley.

The arrangement of the buildings and the (concrete) paths and bridges between them was originally meant to resemble a &quot;harbour of knowledge&quot;, with the buildings symbolising vessels, by architect Helmut Hentrich.

The campus has undergone heavy modernisation and extension efforts, including the construction and refurbishment of several buildings. Some of the original 1960s buildings are to be rebuilt, instead of refurbished, due to PCB contamination. The overall campus concept envisions a modern facility and the placement of Bochum as a &quot;knowledge city&quot;.

==Organization==

Ruhr-University is financed and administered by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Currently, 42,718 students are enrolled, and the university employs around 5,600 staff (411 of which are professors), making it one of the ten largest universities in Germany as of 2014. Kurt Biedenkopf, who later became prime minister of the state of Saxony, was rector of the university from 1967 to 1969.

The university is organized into twenty-one different faculties. These are:

* Faculty of Protestant Theology
* Faculty of Catholic Theology
* Faculty of Philosophy, Education and Journalism
* Faculty of History (including the departments of history, art history and archaeological sciences)
* Faculty of Philology

<text>The Y chromosome is one of two sex chromosomes in therian mammals and other organisms. Along with the X chromosome, it is part of the XY sex-determination system, in which the Y is the sex-determining chromosome because the presence of the Y chromosome causes offspring produced in sexual reproduction to be of male sex. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the SRY gene, which triggers development of male gonads. The Y chromosome is passed only from male parents to male offspring.

== Overview ==

===Discovery===
The Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the mealworm &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;. Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year, working with Hemiptera. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the smaller chromosome (now labelled &quot;Y&quot;) was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. She realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. In the early 1920s, Theophilus Painter determined that X and Y chromosomes determined sex in humans (and other mammals).

The chromosome was given the name &quot;Y&quot; simply to follow on from Henking&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; alphabetically. The idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter &quot;Y&quot; is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.

===Variations===
Most therian mammals have only one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Males have one Y chromosome and one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains a gene, SRY, which triggers embryonic development as a male. The Y chromosomes of humans and other mammals also contain other genes needed for normal sperm production.

Among humans, males with an extra X chromosome have Klinefelter Syndrome, and males with an extra Y chromosome have Jacob&#x27;s Syndrome, as the presence of the Y chromosome determines sex. Other conditions include females with three X chromosomes (or Trisomy X), and Monosomy X (or Turner Syndrome), females that are missing the second X chromosome. Other conditions that affect the development of an XY fetus, such as Swyer Syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in genes such as the SRY gene or MAP3K1 

== Origins and evolution ==

===Before Y chromosome===
Many ectothermic vertebrates have no sex chromosomes. If these species have different sexes, sex is determined environmentally rather than genetically. For some species, especially reptiles, sex depends on the incubation temperature. Some vertebrates are hermaphrodites, though hermaphroditic species are most commonly sequential, meaning the organism switches sex, producing male or female gametes at different points in its life, but never producing both at the same time. This is opposed to simultaneous hermaphroditism, where the same organism produces male and female gametes at the same time. Most simultaneous hermaphrodite species are invertebrates, and among vertebrates, simultaneous hermaphroditism has only been discovered in a few orders of fish.

===Origin===
The X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a pair of identical chromosomes, termed autosomes, when an ancestral animal developed an allelic variation (a so-called &quot;sex locus&quot;) and simply possessing this allele caused the organism to be male. The chromosome with this allele became the Y chromosome, while the other member of the pair became the X chromosome. Over time, genes that were beneficial for males and harmful to (or had no effect on) females either developed on the Y chromosome or were acquired by the Y chromosome through the process of translocation.

Until recently, the X and Y chromosomes in mammals were thought to have diverged around 300 million years ago. However, research published in 2008 analyzing the platypus genome suggested that the XY sex-determination system would not have been present more than 166 million years ago, when monotremes split from other mammals. This re-estimation of the age of the therian XY system is based on the finding that sequences that are on the X chromosomes of marsupials and eutherian mammals are not present on the autosomes of platypus and birds. The older estimate was based on erroneous reports that the platypus X chromosomes contained these sequences.

===Recombination inhibition===
Most chromosomes recombine during meiosis. However, in males, the X and Y pair in a shared region known as the pseudoautosomal region (PAR). The PAR undergoes frequent recombination between the X and Y chromosomes, but recombination is suppressed in other regions of the Y chromosome. These regions contain sex-determining and other male-specific genes. Without this suppression, these genes could be lost from the Y chromosome from recombination and cause issues such as infertility.

The lack of recombination across the majority of the Y chromosome makes it a useful tool in studying human evolution, since recombination complicates the mathematical models used to trace ancestries.

===Degeneration===
By one estimate, the human Y chromosome has lost 1,393 of its 1,438 original genes over the course of its existence, and linear extrapolation of this 1,393-gene loss over 300 million years gives a rate of genetic loss of 4.6 genes per million years. Continued loss of genes at this rate would result in a Y chromosome with no functional genes – that is the Y chromosome would lose complete function – within the next 10 million years, or half that time with the current age estimate of 160 million years. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that many mammalian species are experiencing a similar loss of function in their heterozygous sex chromosome. Degeneration may simply be the fate of all non-recombining sex chromosomes, due to three common evolutionary forces: high mutation rate, inefficient selection, and genetic drift.

With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the human genome. However, these changes have been limited to non-coding sequences and comparisons of the human and chimpanzee Y chromosomes (first published in 2005) show that the human Y chromosome has not lost any genes since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees between 6–7 million years ago. Additionally, a scientific report in 2012 stated that only one gene had been lost since humans diverged from the rhesus macaque 25 million years ago. These facts provide direct evidence that the linear extrapolation model is flawed and suggest that the current human Y chromosome is either no longer shrinking or is shrinking at a much slower rate than the 4.6 genes per million years estimated by the linear extrapolation model.

====High mutation rate====
The human Y chromosome is particularly exposed to high mutation rates due to the environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during gametogenesis. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater opportunity of mutation than the rest of the genome. The increased mutation opportunity for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.

The observation that the Y chromosome experiences little meiotic recombination and has an accelerated rate of mutation and degradative change compared to the rest of the genome suggests an evolutionary explanation for the adaptive function of meiosis with respect to the main body of genetic information. Brandeis proposed that the basic function of meiosis (particularly meiotic recombination) is the conservation of the integrity of the genome, a proposal consistent with the idea that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA damage.

====Inefficient selection====
Without the ability to recombine during meiosis, the Y chromosome is unable to expose individual alleles to natural selection. Deleterious alleles are allowed to &quot;hitchhike&quot; with beneficial neighbors, thus propagating maladapted alleles into the next generation. Conversely, advantageous alleles may be selected against if they are surrounded by harmful alleles (background selection). Due to this inability to sort through its gene content, the Y chromosome is particularly prone to the accumulation of &quot;junk&quot; DNA. Massive accumulations of retrotransposable elements are scattered throughout the Y. The random insertion of DNA segments often disrupts encoded gene sequences and renders them nonfunctional. However, the Y chromosome has no way of weeding out these &quot;jumping genes&quot;. Without the ability to isolate alleles, selection cannot effectively act upon them.

A clear, quantitative indication of this inefficiency is the entropy rate of the Y chromosome. Whereas all other chromosomes in the human genome have entropy rates of 1.5–1.9 bits per nucleotide (compared to the theoretical maximum of exactly 2 for no redundancy), the Y chromosome&#x27;s entropy rate is only 0.84. From the definition of entropy rate, the Y chromosome has a much lower information content relative to its overall length, and is more redundant.

====Genetic drift====
Even if a well adapted Y chromosome manages to maintain genetic activity by avoiding mutation accumulation, there is no guarantee it will be passed down to the next generation. The population size of the Y chromosome is inherently limited to 1/4 that of autosomes: diploid organisms contain two copies of autosomal chromosomes while only half the population contains 1 Y chromosome. Thus, genetic drift is an exceptionally strong force acting upon the Y chromosome. Through sheer random assortment, an adult male may never pass on his Y chromosome if he only has female offspring. Thus, although a male may have a well adapted Y chromosome free of excessive mutation, it may never make it into the next gene pool. The repeat random loss of well-adapted Y chromosomes, coupled with the tendency of the Y chromosome to evolve to have more deleterious mutations rather than less for reasons described above, contributes to the species-wide degeneration of Y chromosomes through Muller&#x27;s ratchet.

=== Gene conversion ===
As has been already mentioned, the Y chromosome is unable to recombine during meiosis like the other human chromosomes; however, in 2003, researchers from MIT discovered a process which may slow down the process of degradation.
They found that human Y chromosome is able to &quot;recombine&quot; with itself, using palindrome base pair sequences. Such a &quot;recombination&quot; is called gene conversion.

In the case of the Y chromosomes, the palindromes are not noncoding DNA; these strings of nucleotides contain functioning genes important for male fertility. Most of the sequence pairs are greater than 99.97% identical. The extensive use of gene conversion may play a role in the ability of the Y chromosome to edit out genetic mistakes and maintain the integrity of the relatively few genes it carries. In other words, since the Y chromosome is single, it has duplicates of its genes on itself instead of having a second, homologous, chromosome. When errors occur, it can use other parts of itself as a template to correct them.

Findings were confirmed by comparing similar regions of the Y chromosome in humans to the Y chromosomes of chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. The comparison demonstrated that the same phenomenon of gene conversion appeared to be at work more than 5 million years ago, when humans and the non-human primates diverged from each other.

Gene conversion tracts formed during meiosis are long, about 2,068 base pairs, and significantly biased towards the fixation of G or C nucleotides (GC biased). The recombination intermediates preceding gene conversion were found to rarely take the alternate route of crossover recombination. The Y-Y gene conversion rate in humans is about 1.52 x 10−5 conversions/base/year. These gene conversion events may reflect a basic function of meiosis, that of conserving the integrity of the genome.

=== Future evolution ===

According to some theories, in the terminal stages of the degeneration of the Y chromosome, other chromosomes may increasingly take over genes and functions formerly associated with it and finally, within the framework of this theory, the Y chromosome disappears entirely, and a new sex-determining system arises.

Several species of rodent in the sister families Muridae and Cricetidae have reached a stage where the XY system has been modified, in the following ways:
* The Transcaucasian mole vole, &quot;Ellobius lutescens&quot;, the Zaisan mole vole, &quot;Ellobius tancrei&quot;, and the Japanese spinous country rats &quot;Tokudaia osimensis&quot; and &quot;Tokudaia tokunoshimensis&quot;, have lost the Y chromosome and SRY entirely. &quot;Tokudaia&quot; spp. have relocated some other genes ancestrally present on the Y chromosome to the X chromosome. Both sexes of &quot;Tokudaia&quot; spp. and &quot;Ellobius lutescens&quot; have an XO genotype (Turner syndrome), whereas all &quot;Ellobius tancrei&quot; possess an XX genotype. The new sex-determining system(s) for these rodents remains unclear.
* The wood lemming &quot;Myopus schisticolor&quot;, the Arctic lemming, &quot;Dicrostonyx torquatus&quot;, and multiple species in the grass mouse genus &quot;Akodon&quot; have evolved fertile females who possess the genotype generally coding for males, XY, in addition to the ancestral XX female, through a variety of modifications to the X and Y chromosomes.
* In the creeping vole, &quot;Microtus oregoni&quot;, the females, with just one X chromosome each, produce X gametes only, and the males, XY, produce Y gametes, or gametes devoid of any sex chromosome, through nondisjunction.
Outside of the rodents, the black muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus crinifrons&quot;, evolved new X and Y chromosomes through fusions of the ancestral sex chromosomes and autosomes.

Modern data cast doubt on the hypothesis that the Y-chromosome will disappear. This conclusion was reached by scientists who studied the Y chromosomes of rhesus monkeys. When genomically comparing the Y chromosome of rhesus monkeys and humans, scientists found very few differences, given that humans and rhesus monkeys diverged 30 million years ago.

Outside of mammals, some organisms have lost the Y chromosome, such as most species of Nematodes. However, in order for the complete elimination of Y to occur, it was necessary to develop an alternative way of determining sex (for example, by determining sex by the ratio of the X chromosome to autosomes), and any genes necessary for male function had to be moved to other chromosomes. In the meantime, modern data demonstrate the complex mechanisms of Y chromosome evolution and the fact that the disappearance of the Y chromosome is not guaranteed.

===1:1 sex ratio===
Fisher&#x27;s principle outlines why almost all species using sexual reproduction have a sex ratio of 1:1. W. D. Hamilton gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on &quot;Extraordinary sex ratios&quot;, given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore, parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore, the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore, 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

==Non-therian Y chromosome==
Many groups of organisms in addition to therian mammals have Y chromosomes, but these Y chromosomes do not share common ancestry with therian Y chromosomes. Such groups include monotremes, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, some other insects, some fish, some reptiles, and some plants. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the Y chromosome does not trigger male development. Instead, sex is determined by the number of X chromosomes. The &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; Y chromosome does contain genes necessary for male fertility. So XXY &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; are female, and &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; with a single X (X0), are male but sterile. There are some species of Drosophila in which X0 males are both viable and fertile.

===ZW chromosomes===
Other organisms have mirror image sex chromosomes: where the homogeneous sex is the male, with two Z chromosomes, and the female is the heterogeneous sex with a Z chromosome and a W chromosome. For example, the ZW sex-determination system is found in birds, snakes, and butterflies; the females have ZW sex chromosomes, and males have ZZ sex chromosomes.

===Non-inverted Y chromosome===
There are some species, such as the Japanese rice fish, in which the XY system is still developing and cross over between the X and Y is still possible. Because the male specific region is very small and contains no essential genes, it is even possible to artificially induce XX males and YY females to no ill effect.

===Multiple XY pairs===
Monotremes like platypuses possess four or five pairs of XY sex chromosomes, each pair consisting of sex chromosomes with homologous regions. The chromosomes of neighboring pairs are partially homologous, such that a chain is formed during mitosis. The first X chromosome in the chain is also partially homologous with the last Y chromosome, indicating that profound rearrangements, some adding new pieces from autosomes, have occurred in history.

Platypus sex chromosomes have strong sequence similarity with the avian Z chromosome, indicating close homology, and the SRY gene so central to sex-determination in most other mammals is apparently not involved in platypus sex-determination.

==Human Y chromosome==
The human Y chromosome is composed of about 62 million base pairs of DNA, making it similar in size to chromosome 19 and represents almost 2% of the total DNA in a male cell. The human Y chromosome carries 693 genes, 106 of which are protein-coding. However, some genes are repeated, making the number of exclusive protein-coding genes just 42. The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) Project only classifies 63 out of 107 genes.

All single-copy Y-linked genes are hemizygous (present on only one chromosome) except in cases of aneuploidy such as XYY syndrome or XXYY syndrome. Traits that are inherited via the Y chromosome are called Y-linked traits, or holandric traits (from Ancient Greek ὅλος &quot;hólos&quot;, &quot;whole&quot; + ἀνδρός &quot;andrós&quot;, &quot;male&quot;).

At the end of the Human Genome Project (and after many updates) almost half of the Y chromosome remained un-sequenced even in 2021; a different Y chromosome from the HG002 (GM24385) genome was completely sequenced in January 2022 and is included in the new &quot;complete genome&quot; human reference genome sequence, CHM13. The complete sequencing of a human Y chromosome was shown to contain 62,460,029 base pairs and 41 additional genes. This added 30 million base pairs, but it was discovered that the Y chromosome can vary a lot in size between individuals, from 45.2 million to 84.9 million base pairs.

Since almost half of the human Y sequence was unknown before 2022, it could not be screened out as contamination in microbial sequencing projects. As a result, the NCBI RefSeq bacterial genome database mistakenly includes some Y chromosome data.

=== Structure ===
====Cytogenetic band====

====Non-combining region of Y (NRY)====

The human Y chromosome is normally unable to recombine with the X chromosome, except for small pieces of pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) at the telomeres (which comprise about 5% of the chromosome&#x27;s length). These regions are relics of ancient homology between the X and Y chromosomes. The bulk of the Y chromosome, which does not recombine, is called the &quot;NRY&quot;, or non-recombining region of the Y chromosome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region are used to trace direct paternal ancestral lines.

More specifically, PAR1 is at 0.1–2.7 Mb. PAR2 is at 56.9–57.2 Mb. The non-recombining region (NRY) or male-specific region (MSY) sits between. Their sizes is now known perfectly from CHM13: 2.77 Mb and 329.5 kb. Until CHM13 the data in PAR1 and PAR2 was just copied over from X chromosome.

==== Sequence classes ====

===Genes===
==== Number of genes ====
Older gene count estimates of human Y chromosome used only partial sequences. Only the T2T sequence (2023) was able to produce a complete sequence of the human Y chromosome.

==== Gene list ====

In general, the human Y chromosome is extremely gene poor—it is one of the largest gene deserts in the human genome. Disregarding pseudoautosomal genes, genes encoded on the human Y chromosome include:

=== Y-chromosome-linked diseases ===
Diseases linked to the Y chromosome typically involve an aneuploidy, an atypical number of chromosomes.

==== Loss of Y chromosome ====
Males can lose the Y chromosome in a subset of cells, known as mosaic loss. Mosaic loss is strongly associated with age, and smoking is another important risk factor for mosaic loss.

Mosaic loss may be related to health outcomes, indicating that the Y chromosome plays important roles outside of sex determination. Males with a higher percentage of hematopoietic stem cells lacking the Y chromosome have a higher risk of certain cancers and have a shorter life expectancy. In many cases, a cause and effect relationship between the Y chromosome and health outcomes has not been determined, and some propose loss of the Y chromosome could be a &quot;neutral karyotype related to normal aging&quot;. However, a 2022 study showed that mosaic loss of the Y chromosome causally contributes to fibrosis, heart risks, and mortality.

Further studies are needed to understand how mosaic Y chromosome loss may contribute to other sex differences in health outcomes, such as how male smokers have between 1.5 and 2 times the risk of non-respiratory cancers as female smokers. Potential countermeasures identified so far include not smoking or stopping smoking and at least one potential drug that &quot;may help counteract the harmful effects of the chromosome loss&quot; is under investigation.

==== Y chromosome microdeletion ====
Y chromosome microdeletion (YCM) is a family of genetic disorders caused by missing genes in the Y chromosome. Many affected men exhibit no symptoms and lead normal lives. However, YCM is also known to be present in a significant number of men with reduced fertility or reduced sperm count.

==== Defective Y chromosome ====
This results in the person presenting a female phenotype (i.e., is born with female-like genitalia) even though that person possesses an XY karyotype. The lack of the second X results in infertility. In other words, viewed from the opposite direction, the person goes through defeminization but fails to complete masculinization.

The cause can be seen as an incomplete Y chromosome: the usual karyotype in these cases is 45X, plus a fragment of Y. This usually results in defective testicular development, such that the infant may or may not have fully formed male genitalia internally or externally. The full range of ambiguity of structure may occur, especially if mosaicism is present. When the Y fragment is minimal and nonfunctional, the child is usually a girl with the features of Turner syndrome or mixed gonadal dysgenesis.

==== XXY ====
Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is not an aneuploidy of the Y chromosome, but a condition of having an extra X chromosome, which usually results in defective postnatal testicular function. The mechanism is not fully understood; it does not seem to be due to direct interference by the extra X with expression of Y genes.

==== XYY ====
47, XYY syndrome (simply known as XYY syndrome) is caused by the presence of a single extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male&#x27;s cells. 47, XYY males have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Researchers have found that an extra copy of the Y chromosome is associated with increased stature and an increased incidence of learning problems in some boys and men, but the effects are variable, often minimal, and the vast majority do not know their karyotype.

In 1965 and 1966 Patricia Jacobs and colleagues published a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at
Scotland&#x27;s only special security hospital for the developmentally disabled,
finding a higher than expected number of patients to have an extra Y chromosome. The authors of this study wondered &quot;whether an extra Y chromosome predisposes its carriers to unusually aggressive behaviour&quot;, and this conjecture &quot;framed the next fifteen years of research on the human Y chromosome&quot;.

Through studies over the next decade, this conjecture was shown to be incorrect: the elevated crime rate of XYY males is due to lower median intelligence and not increased aggression, and increased height was the only characteristic that could be reliably associated with XYY males. The &quot;criminal karyotype&quot; concept is therefore inaccurate.

There are also XXXY syndrome and XXXXY syndrome.

====Rare====
The following Y-chromosome-linked diseases are rare, but notable because of their elucidation of the nature of the Y chromosome.

=====More than two Y chromosomes=====
Greater degrees of Y chromosome polysomy (having more than one extra copy of the Y chromosome in every cell, e.g., XYYY) are considerably more rare. The extra genetic material in these cases can lead to skeletal abnormalities, dental abnormalities, decreased IQ, delayed development, and respiratory issues, but the severity features of these conditions are variable.

=====XX male syndrome=====
XX male syndrome occurs due to a genetic recombination in the formation of the male gametes, causing the SRY portion of the Y chromosome to move to the X chromosome. When such an X chromosome is present in a zygote, male gonads develop because of the SRY gene.

=== Genetic genealogy ===
In human genetic genealogy (the application of genetics to traditional genealogy), use of the information contained in the Y chromosome is of particular interest because, unlike other chromosomes, the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son, on the patrilineal line. Mitochondrial DNA, maternally inherited to both sons and daughters, is used in an analogous way to trace the matrilineal line.

===Brain function===
Research is currently investigating whether male-pattern neural development is a direct consequence of Y-chromosome-related gene expression or an indirect result of Y-chromosome-related androgenic hormone production.

===Microchimerism===
In 1974, male chromosomes were discovered in fetal cells in the blood circulation of women.

In 1996, it was found that male fetal progenitor cells could persist postpartum in the maternal blood stream for as long as 27 years.

A 2004 study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, investigated the origin of male chromosomes found in the peripheral blood of women who had not had male progeny. A total of 120 subjects (women who had never had sons) were investigated, and it was found that 21% of them had male DNA in their peripheral blood. The subjects were categorised into four groups based on their case histories:
* Group A (8%) had had only female progeny.
* Patients in Group B (22%) had a history of one or more miscarriages.
* Patients Group C (57%) had their pregnancies medically terminated.
* Group D (10%) had never been pregnant before.

The study noted that 10% of the women had never been pregnant before, raising the question of where the Y chromosomes in their blood could have come from. The study suggests that possible reasons for occurrence of male chromosome microchimerism could be one of the following:
* miscarriages,
* pregnancies,
* vanished male twin,
* possibly from sexual intercourse.

A 2012 study at the same institute has detected cells with the Y chromosome in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.

<text>CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, formerly Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe) is a major international humanitarian agency delivering emergency relief and long-term international development projects. Founded in 1945, CARE is nonsectarian, impartial, and non-governmental. It is one of the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organizations focused on fighting global poverty. In 2019, CARE reported working in 104 countries, supporting 1,349 poverty-fighting projects and humanitarian aid projects, and reaching over 92.3 million people directly and 433.3 million people indirectly.

CARE&#x27;s programmes in the developing world address a broad range of topics including emergency response, food security, water and sanitation, economic development, climate change, agriculture, education, and health. CARE also advocates at the local, national, and international levels for policy change and the rights of poor people. Within each of these areas, CARE focuses on empowering and meeting the needs of women and girls and promoting gender equality.

CARE International is a confederation of eighteen CARE national members, each of which is registered as an autonomous non-profit non-governmental organization in its own country, two candidate members and one affiliate member.

== History ==
=== 1945–1949: Origins and the CARE Package ===

CARE, then the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe, was formally founded on November 27, 1945, and was originally intended to be a temporary organization. Twenty-two members from the American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service met to ratify the articles of incorporation for CARE to Europe. Churches, welfare organisations and trade unions were among the 22 founding members. World War II had ended in August of the same year. After pressure from the public and Congress, President Harry S. Truman agreed to let private organizations provide relief for those starving due to the war. CARE was initially a consortium of twenty-two U.S. charities (a mixture of civic, religious, cooperative, farm, and labour organizations) to deliver food aid to Europe in the aftermath of World War II. Donald M. Nelson was the first executive director, but then William N. Haskell served as executive director from late 1945 until 1947. In February 1946, William N. Haskell wrote to Oskar Lange, the Polish ambassador in Washington, explaining the plan and asking for his assistance in obtaining Polish government&#x27;s consent to its extension to Poland. The organization delivered its first food packages in 1946.

CARE&#x27;s food aid took the form of CARE Packages, which were at first delivered to specific individuals: the US people paid $10 to send a CARE Package of food to a loved one in Europe, often a family member. President Truman bought the first CARE package. CARE guaranteed delivery within four months to anyone in Europe, even if they had left their last known address, and returned a signed delivery receipt to the sender. Because European postal services were unreliable at the time these signed receipts were sometimes the first confirmation that the recipient had survived the war.

The first CARE Packages were in fact surplus &quot;Ten-in-One&quot; US army rations packs (designed to contain a day&#x27;s meals for ten people). In early 1946 CARE purchased 2.8 million of these warehoused rations packs, originally intended for the invasion of Japan, and began advertising in America. On May 11, 1946, six months after the agency&#x27;s incorporation, the first CARE Packages were delivered in Le Havre, France. These packages contained staples such as canned meats, powdered milk, dried fruits, and fats along with a few comfort items such as chocolate, coffee, and cigarettes. (Several on the CARE Board of Directors wished to remove the cigarettes, but it was deemed impractical to open and reseal 2.8 million boxes.) 1946 also marked CARE&#x27;s first expansion out of the US with the establishment of an office in Canada.

By early 1947 the supply of &quot;Ten-in-One&quot; ration packs had been exhausted and CARE began assembling its own packages. These new packages were designed with the help of a nutritionist. They did not include cigarettes and were tailored somewhat by destination: Kosher packages were developed, and for example packages destined for the United Kingdom included tea rather than coffee, and packages for Italy included pasta. By 1949 CARE offered and shipped more than twelve different packages. From July 1948 to the present, CARE sent 100,000 packages to Japan.

Although the organization had originally intended to deliver packages only to specified individuals, within a year CARE began delivering packages addressed for example &quot;to a teacher&quot; or simply &quot;to a hungry person in Europe&quot;. These unspecified donations continued and in early 1948 CARE&#x27;s board voted narrowly to officially move towards unspecified donations and to expand into more general relief. Some founding member agencies disagreed with this shift, arguing that more general relief would be a duplication of the work of other agencies, but donors reacted favourably, contributions increased, and this decision would mark the beginning of CARE&#x27;s shift towards a broader mandate.

Between the first deliveries of 1946 and the last European deliveries of 1956, millions of CARE Packages were distributed throughout Europe, over 50% of them to Germany including many delivered as part of the Berlin airlift in response to the 1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin. The Polish CARE Mission was formally closed by its head, George Goodfellow on December 31, 1949. During CARE&#x27;s activity in Poland from May 1946 to December 1949, it delivered 201,872 packages valued at $2,067,528.5.

The US Agricultural Act of 1949 made surplus US agricultural products available to be shipped abroad as aid either directly by the US government or by NGOs including CARE. In 1954 Public Law 480, also known as the Food for Peace Act, further expanded the availability of surplus US food as aid. This act allowed CARE to expand its feeding programs and disaster relief operations considerably, and between 1949 and 2009 CARE used hundreds of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of surplus commodities in disaster relief and programs such as school lunch provision.

=== 1949–1956: Transition out of Europe ===

Although the organization&#x27;s mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in Japan. Deliveries to China and Korea followed, which CARE described as aid to areas &quot;implicated by WWII&quot;. In 1949 CARE entered the developing world for the first time, launching programs in the Philippines. Projects in India, Pakistan, and Mexico began soon after. 1949 also marked CARE&#x27;s first expansion into non-food aid with the development of &quot;self-help&quot; packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades. In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to &quot;Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere&quot;.

As Europe recovered economically, CARE faced the need to re-evaluate its mission: in 1955 several board members argued that with the European recovery CARE&#x27;s mandate was finished and the organization should dissolve. Other Board members however felt that CARE&#x27;s mission should continue albeit with a new focus on the developing world. In July 1955 the Board of Directors voted to continue and expand CARE projects outside of Europe. Paul French, CARE&#x27;s executive director at the time, resigned over the debate. New executive director Richard W. Reuter took over in 1955 and helped lead the organization in a new direction. Twenty-two of CARE&#x27;s forty-two missions were closed, mostly in European countries, and efforts were concentrated on food distribution and emergency response in the developing world. In 1956 CARE distributed food to refugees of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and this would be among the last of CARE&#x27;s operations in Europe for many years.

=== 1957–1975: Transition into broader development work ===

With a broadened geographic focus came a broadened approach as CARE began to expand beyond its original food distribution program. In order to reflect these new broader aims, in 1959 CARE changed the meaning of its acronym a second time, becoming the &quot;Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere&quot;.
Reflecting this broadened scope, CARE became involved in 1961 with President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s establishment of the Peace Corps. CARE was tasked with selecting and training the first group of volunteers, who would later be deployed to development projects in Colombia. The Peace Corps assumed greater control over the training of Peace Corps Volunteers in subsequent missions, but CARE continued to provide country directors to the Peace Corps until CARE-Peace Corps joint projects ended in 1967.

In 1962 CARE merged with and absorbed the medical aid organization MEDICO, which it had been working closely with for several years previously. The merger considerably increased CARE&#x27;s capacity to deliver health programming including trained medical personnel and medical supplies.

During this transition the original CARE Package was phased out. The last food package was delivered in 1967 and the last tools package in 1968. Over 100 million CARE Packages had been delivered worldwide since the first shipment to France. Although 1968 marked the official &quot;retirement&quot; of the CARE Package the format would occasionally be used again, for example in CARE&#x27;s relief to the republics of the former Soviet Union and to survivors of the Bosnian War. The concept was also revived in 2011 as an online campaign encouraging donors to fill a &quot;virtual CARE Package&quot; with food aid and services such as education and healthcare.

1967 also marked CARE&#x27;s first partnership agreement with a government: for the construction of schools in Honduras. Partnership agreements with governments led programmes to become country-wide rather than targeted only to a few communities. CARE&#x27;s programmes during this era focused largely on the construction of schools and nutrition centres, and the continued distribution of food. Nutrition centres in particular would become one of CARE&#x27;s major areas of concentration, linking with school feeding programs and nutrition education aimed at new mothers.

In 1975 CARE implemented a multi-year planning system, again allowing programmes to become both broader and deeper in scope. Projects became increasingly multi-faceted, providing for example not only health education but also access to clean water and an agricultural program to improve nutrition. The multi-year planning system also increased the scope for country-wide projects and partnerships with local governments. A 1977 project for example provided for the construction of over 200 pre-schools and kindergartens throughout Chile over several years, jointly funded by CARE and the Chilean Ministry of Education.

=== 1975–1990: From CARE to CARE International ===

Although CARE had opened an office in Canada in 1946, it was not until the mid-1970s that the organization truly started to become an international body. CARE Canada (initially Care of Canada) became an autonomous body in 1973. In 1976 CARE Europe was established in Bonn following the successful fund-raising campaign &quot;Dank an CARE&quot; (Thanks to CARE). In 1981 CARE Germany was created and CARE Europe moved its headquarters to Paris. CARE Norway had been created in 1980, and CAREs in Italy and the UK were established. The popularity of CARE offices in Europe was attributed to the fact that many Europeans remembered receiving CARE assistance themselves between 1945 and 1955.

In 1979 planning began for the establishment of an umbrella organization to coordinate and prevent duplication among the various national CARE organizations. This new body was named CARE International and met for the first time on January 29, 1982, with CARE Canada, CARE Germany, CARE Norway, and CARE USA (formerly simply CARE) in attendance.

CARE International would expand significantly during the 1980s, with the addition of CARE France in 1983; CARE International UK in 1985; CARE Austria in 1986; and CARE Australia, CARE Denmark, and CARE Japan in 1987.

=== 1990–present: Recent history ===

Along with broader development work CARE&#x27;s projects in the 1980s and early 1990s focused particularly on agroforestry initiatives such as reforestation and soil conservation in eastern Africa and South America. CARE also responded to a number of major emergencies during this period, notably the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia and the 1991–1992 famine in Somalia.

The 1990s also saw an evolution in CARE&#x27;s approach to poverty. Originally CARE had viewed poverty primarily as a lack of basic goods and services such as food, clean water, and health care. As CARE&#x27;s scope expanded both geographically and topically this approach was expanded to include the view that poverty was in many cases caused by social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination. In the early 1990s CARE adopted a household livelihood security framework which included a multidimensional view of poverty as encompassing not only physical resources but also social position and human capacities. As a result of this, by 2000, CARE had adopted a rights-based approach to development.

One of their buildings was attacked, and people were killed and wounded, during the September 2016 Kabul attacks. In the 2021 Fall of Kabul after American troops withdrawal, and the fear to women and girls, caused by the Taliban takeover of government, CARE&#x27;s deputy country director, Marianne O&#x27;Grady was reported as saying that women would continue educating their families and neighbours, even &#x27;behind the walls&#x27;, compared to the regime 25 years ago, despite Taliban rules.

==== Microfinance ====
In the early 1990s CARE also developed what would become an important model for cooperative microfinance. This model is called the Village Savings and Loans Associations and it began in 1991 as a pilot project run by CARE&#x27;s Country Office in Niger. The pilot project was called Mata Masu Dubara and CARE Niger developed the model by adapting the model of Accumulating Savings and Credit Associations. The model involve groups of about 15–30 people who regularly save and borrow using a group fund. Member savings create capital that can be used for short-term loans and capital and interest is shared among the group at the end of a given period (usually about a year), at which point the groups normally re-form to begin a new cycle. Because the bookkeeping required to manage a Village Savings and Loans Association is quite simple and most groups successfully become independent within a year and enjoy a high rate of long-term group survival. CARE has created over 40,000 Village Savings and Loans Associations (over 1 million members total) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America and in 2008 launched Access Africa which aims to extend Village Savings and Loans Association training to 39 African countries by 2018.

The model has also been widely replicated in Africa and Asia and by other large NGOs including Oxfam, Plan International, and Catholic Relief Services.

CARE UK later launched lendwithcare.org, which allows members of the public to make microloans, including green loans, to entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia. It avoids many of the criticisms levelled at Kiva.org.

==== Acronym redefinition and 50th anniversary ====
In 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the &quot;Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere&quot;. CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.

CARE expanded the confederation to twelve members in the early 2000s, with CARE Netherlands (formerly the Disaster Relief Agency) joining in 2001 and CARE Thailand (called the Raks Thai Foundation) joining in 2003, becoming the first CARE National Member in a developing country.

CARE&#x27;s well-known &quot;I am Powerful&quot; campaign launched in the US in September 2006 and was intended to bring public attention to the organization&#x27;s long-standing focus on women&#x27;s empowerment. CARE states that its programs focus on women and girls both because the world&#x27;s poor are disproportionately female and because women&#x27;s empowerment is thought to be an important driver of development. CARE also emphasizes that it considers working with boys and men an important part of women&#x27;s empowerment, and that women&#x27;s empowerment benefits both genders.

In 2007 CARE announced that by 2009 it would no longer accept certain types of US food aid worth some $45 million a year, arguing that these types of food aid are inefficient and harmful to local markets. Specifically, CARE announced that it would forego all monetized food aid (surplus US food shipped to charities in the developing world who then sell the food on the local market to finance development projects) and all food aid intended to establish a commercial advantage for the donor, and would increase its commitment to buying food aid locally. CARE also announced that it would no longer accept USDA food through Title 1 (concessional sales) or Section 416 (surplus disposal) because these programs are intended mainly to establish a commercial advantage for US agriculture.

In 2011 CARE added its first affiliate member, CARE India, and in 2012 the CI board accepted CARE Peru as CARE&#x27;s second affiliate member. CARE India became a full member in November 2013. The CI board accepted CARE Peru as a full member of the confederation in June 2015.

CARE is currently one of the only major NGOs to make their database of project evaluations publicly available, and to regularly conduct a meta-analysis of evaluation methodologies and overall organizational impact.

== Structure ==
CARE International is a confederation of () eighteen national members, two candidate members, and one affiliate member, coordinated by the CARE international secretariat. The secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York City and in Brussels to liaise with the United Nations and European institutions, respectively.

Each CARE national member is an autonomous non-governmental organization registered in the country and runs programs, fundraising, and communications activities both in its own country and in developing countries in which CARE operates. The members are:
&quot;National members are shown as type &quot;N&quot;, candidate members as type &quot;C&quot;, amd affiliate members as type &quot;A&quot;.&quot;

== Programming scope ==
In 2016 CARE was active in the following countries (as well as in member and affiliate countries):

A total of 962 development and humanitarian aid projects were carried out in these countries, with 80,120,323 million people directly reached. The breakdown by region was as follows:

For the fiscal year 2016, CARE reported a budget of more than 574 million Euros and a staff of 9,175 (94% of them local citizens of the country where they work).

=== Emergency response ===
CARE supports emergency relief as well as prevention, preparedness, and recovery programs. In 2016, CARE reportedly reached more than 7.2 million people through its humanitarian response. CARE&#x27;s core sectors for emergency response are Food Security, Shelter, WASH and Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health. CARE is a signatory of major international humanitarian standards and codes of conduct including the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, the Sphere standards, and the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) principles and standards.

== Networks and partnerships ==
CARE is a signatory to the following standards of humanitarian intervention: the Code of Conduct for The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, the Sphere standards, and the Core Humanitarian Standard
As well, CARE is a member of a number of networks aiming to improve the quality and coordination of humanitarian aid: The Emergency Capacity Building Project, The Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies, the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action, the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response, the International Council for Voluntary Agencies, and the INGO Accountability Charter. CARE also regularly engages in joint advocacy campaigns with other major NGOs. The Global Campaign for Climate Change Action is one example.

<doc id="246893" wikidata="Q1062632" url="?curid=246893" title="Triple Crown of Cycling">
<text>The Triple Crown of Cycling in road bicycle racing denotes the achievement of winning three major titles in the same season: the UCI Road World Championships Road Race, the Tour de France general classification, and the general classification of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. It is considered by many fans of the sport to be the greatest &#x27;single&#x27; achievement in cycling. 

The triple crown of cycling has been achieved by three men, Eddy Merckx in 1974, Stephen Roche in 1987 and Tadej Pogačar in 2024. There are no three week grand tours in women&#x27;s cycling, however the Tour de France Femmes, Giro d&#x27;Italia Women and the World Championship were won by Annemiek van Vleuten in 2022, with van Vleuten also winning the Challenge by La Vuelta race (the predecessor to the La Vuelta Femenina). 

Despite the prestige and recognition of the achievement, the Triple Crown of cycling is not an official title, and there is no physical award given for its accomplishment.

==Other definitions==

===Career Triple Crown===
Only seven riders have won the equivalent of a career Triple Crown, meaning a Gold in the UCI Road World Championships road race, the Tour de France, and the Giro d&#x27;Italia. In addition to Merckx, Roche, Pogacar and Van Vleuten who won the triple crown in a single season they are Fausto Coppi, Felice Gimondi and Bernard Hinault.

===Grand Tours===
No rider has ever won all three grand tours in a single calendar year, but three riders – Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Chris Froome – have won all three in a row, split over calendar years. Seven men have won all three grand tours in their career; Gimondi and Hinault have achieved that alongside a career Triple Crown, and Merckx alongside a classic Triple Crown.

In women&#x27;s cycling, the status of the Grand Tours is less established, and the races are considerably shorter. While the Giro d&#x27;Italia Women was first held in 1988 and consistently since 1993, a full Tour de France Femmes was only launched in 2022 (though the Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale offered a female equivalent of the Tour from 1984-2009) and La Vuelta Femenina was only established in 2023. Nonetheless, taking these races as &#x27;Grand Tours&#x27;, Annemiek van Vleuten is the only rider to have won all three in her career, having won them in a row – in addition to the 2022 World Championships – split across 2021, 2022 and 2023. She is the only cyclist win all three Grand Tours, and the World Championship in one year, she wins nine Grand Tours, and six in a row/consecutive in 2021-2022-2023. 

====&quot;All the jerseys&quot;====
While no male rider has ever won all three grand tours in a single calendar year/season, three riders have won the three Grand tours consecutively across two seasons, thus holding &quot;all the jerseys&quot; at one time:

* Eddy Merckx won four consecutive grand tours in 1972–1973: Giro 1972, Tour 1972, Vuelta 1973, and Giro 1973;
* Bernard Hinault won three consecutive grand tours in 1982–1983: Giro 1982, Tour 1982, and Vuelta 1983;
* Chris Froome won three consecutive grand tours in 2017–2018: Tour 2017, Vuelta 2017 and Giro 2018 before finishing 3rd in Tour 2018.

====Career winners of all three Grand Tours====
In bold the win that achieved a career winners of all three Grand Tours.

 designates a World Championship winner.

===Winning world titles in three disciplines===
In 2014, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot won the World Championship road race and followed this in 2015 with the world championships in cyclocross and cross-country mountain biking, which meant she held world titles in three cycling disciplines simultaneously. She subsequently won the gravel world championship as well.

Winning world championships in at least three disciplines across a career has also been achieved by Marianne Vos (road race three times, cyclo-cross on eight occasions, track twice (in a different discipline each time) and gravel racing once) and Mathieu van der Poel (cyclo cross seven times, road and gravel once each).

<doc id="246894" wikidata="Q4545906" url="?curid=246894" title="10-in-1 food parcel">
<text>The 10-in-1 food parcel, commonly known as the 10-in-1 ration, was a United States military ration issued during World War II. As its name implies, the 10-in-1 provided the needs of ten soldiers in a single ration package.

==Development==
Although the possibility of packing the B ration in units of ten was suggested early into World War II, progress on such an arrangement did not begin until 1943 when the Mountain ration, Jungle ration, and 5-in-1 rations were discontinued. The success of the British &quot;Composite 14-in-1 ration&quot; during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration. A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:

&quot;A small-group field ration [shall be] composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each. … The inner and outer packages are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents. They are to be of such shape and dimensions as to be suitable for either animal-pack or man-carry, and sufficiently sturdy as to material and construction to withstand normal handling and transportation in motor vehicles, on pack animals or by individual portage.&quot;

Specification requirements were quickly published, and the ration was standardized as the replacement for other group rations such as the 5-in-1 ration. Although superseding the 5-in-1, the 10-in-1 was essentially two 5-in-1s packed in one unit. Within such a combination, a greater variety of contents was possible; the number of &quot;menus&quot; was increased to five, compared to the three-menu arrangement of the 5-in-1. In ensuing war years, several revisions were made to the original specification, but their intended purpose of providing one day&#x27;s food for ten men, remained unaltered. Within the daily plan, complete group meals were specified for breakfast and supper while a partial dinner unit was provided for the luncheon meal. 

A typical menu included such canned items as butter-substitute spread, soluble coffee, pudding, meat units, jam, evaporated milk, and vegetables as well as biscuits, cereal, beverages, candy, salt, and sugar. Accessory items were can opener, toilet paper, soap, towels, and water-purification (halazone) tablets. The partial dinner unit was enclosed in a cellophane bag-in-carton for easy distribution to the individual soldier for his noontime meal. Within the unit were biscuits, a confection, beverage powder, sugar, gum, and a can opener. These items were provided on the theory that an individual &quot;snack&quot; was sufficient for midday meals, when there would be neither time nor opportunity to prepare the ration for group feeding.

==Revision==
The similarity of the partial unit to the K-ration was a chief reason for the proposed revision of the 10-in-1 in 1945. The revised 10-in-1 was intended for use during and after the 1945 planned attack on Japan during World War II. It was planned to eliminate the unit ration concept, and to assemble the entire ration on the basis of three group meals rather than two group meals and one individual luncheon package. Although it was recognized that the overall weight of the ration would be increased thereby, it was felt that the added weight would be offset by the increased acceptability and nutritional value which a greater variety of components would provide. The end of the war prevented realization of such a plan in the 10-in-1, leaving a surplus of food. Through the form of CARE Packages, the humanitarian group CARE provided a means to transfer the ration surplus to those starving in Europe.
Over 300 million rations, costing about 85 cents each, were procured under the 10-in-1 title from mid-1943 to the end of World War II. No other group ration was procured during that period. Hence, in actuality as well as nomenclature, &quot;Ration, 10-in-1&quot; was the final small-group ration of World War II.

<text>Apologetics (from Greek ) is the religious discipline of defending religious doctrines through systematic argumentation and discourse. Early Christian writers (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against critics and recommended their faith to outsiders were called Christian apologists. In 21st-century usage, &quot;apologetics&quot; is often identified with debates over religion and theology.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;apologetics&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek word (). In the Classical Greek legal system, the prosecution delivered the (), the accusation or charge, and the defendant replied with an &quot;&quot;, the defence. The was a formal speech or explanation to reply to and rebut the charges. A famous example is Socrates&#x27; Apologia defense, as chronicled in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;.

In the Koine Greek of the New Testament, the Apostle Paul employs the term &quot;apologia&quot; in his trial speech to Festus and Agrippa when he says &quot;I make my defense&quot; in Acts 26:2. A cognate form appears in Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Philippians as he is &quot;defending the gospel&quot; in Philippians 1:7, and in &quot;giving an answer&quot; in 1 Peter 3:15.

Although the term &quot;apologetics&quot; has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.

== Apologetic positions ==

===Baháʼí Faith===

Many apologetic books have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the Baháʼí Faith. The religion&#x27;s founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion; among them are the Báb&#x27;s &quot;Seven Proofs&quot; and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot;. Later Baháʼí authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as Mírzá Abu&#x27;l-Fadl&#x27;s &quot;The Brilliant Proof&quot; and Udo Schaefer et al.&#x27;s &quot;Making the Crooked Straight&quot;.

===Buddhism===
One of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is &quot;The Questions of King Milinda&quot;, which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the &quot;no-self&quot; nature of the individual and characteristics such as wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the Meiji Era (1868-1912), encounters between Buddhists and Christians in Japan as a result of increasing contact between Japan and other nations may have prompted the formation of Japanese New Buddhism, including the apologetic Shin Bukkyō () magazine. In recent times, A. L. De Silva, an Australian convert to Buddhism, has written a book, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine. Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the Christian concept of God from a Theravadin Buddhist perspective.

===Christianity===

Christian apologetics combines Christian theology, natural theology, and philosophy in an attempt to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation, and to show that the Christian doctrine is the only world-view that is faultless and consistent with all fundamental knowledge and questions.

Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the Roman Empire, Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. Examples in the Bible include the Apostle Paul&#x27;s address to the Athenians in the Areopagus (Acts 17: 22-34). J. David Cassel gives several examples: Tacitus wrote that Nero fabricated charges that Christians started the burning of Rome. Other charges included cannibalism (due to a literal interpretation of the Eucharist) and incest (due to early Christians&#x27; practice of addressing each other as &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;sister&quot;). Paul the Apostle, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.

Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. Theodicy is one important aspect of such arguments, and Alvin Plantinga&#x27;s arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in physics, cosmology, comparative religions, and other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are Douglas Groothuis, Frederick Copleston, John Lennox, Walter R. Martin, Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, Douglas Wilson, Cornelius Van Til, Gordon Clark, Francis Schaeffer, Greg Bahnsen, Edward John Carnell, James White, R. C. Sproul, Hank Hanegraaff, Alister McGrath, Lee Strobel, Josh McDowell, Peter Kreeft, G. K. Chesterton, William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland, Hugh Ross, David Bentley Hart, Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, Scott Hahn, RC Kunst, Trent Horn, and Jimmy Akin.

Apologists in the Catholic Church include Bishop Robert Barron, G. K. Chesterton, Dr. Scott Hahn, Trent Horn, Jimmy Akin, Patrick Madrid, Kenneth Hensley, Karl Keating, Ronald Knox, and Peter Kreeft.

John Henry Newman (1801–1890) was an English convert to Roman Catholicism, later made a cardinal, and beatified in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the Oxford Movement to bring the Church of England back to its Catholic roots. Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot;, in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.

Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments. The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics uses the transcendental argument for the existence of God.

Tertullian was an early Christian apologist. He was born, lived, and died in Carthage. He is sometimes known as the &quot;Father of the Latin Church&quot;. He introduced the term &quot;Trinity&quot; () to the Christian vocabulary and probably the formula &quot;three Persons, one Substance&quot; as the Latin &quot;tres Personae, una Substantia&quot; (from the Koine Greek &quot;treis Hypostaseis, Homoousios&quot;), and the terms &quot;Vetus Testamentum&quot; (Old Testament) and &quot;Novum Testamentum&quot; (New Testament).

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

There are Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of Mormonism, including early church leaders, such as Parley P. Pratt, John Taylor, B. H. Roberts, and James E. Talmage, and modern figures, such as Hugh Nibley, Daniel C. Peterson, John L. Sorenson, John Gee, Orson Scott Card, and Jeff Lindsay.

Several well known apologetic organizations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, such as the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (a group of scholars at Brigham Young University) and FairMormon (an independent, not-for-profit group run by Latter Day Saints), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the Latter Day Saint movement in general and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in particular.

=== Deism ===
Deism is a form of theism in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a natural religion where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature. The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.

===Hinduism===
Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period. A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British Indologists, were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of Sanskrit. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.

In the early 18th century, Christian missionary Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg engaged in dialogues with several Tamil-speaking Malabarian Hindu priests, and recorded arguments of these Hindu apologists. These records include German-language reports submitted to the Lutheran headquarters in Halle, and 99 letters written by the Hindu priests to him (later translated into German under the title &quot;Malabarische Korrespondenz&quot; from 1718 onwards).

During 1830–1831, missionary John Wilson engaged in debates with Hindu apologists in Bombay. In 1830, his protege Ram Chandra, a Hindu convert to Christianity, debated with several Hindu Brahmin apologists in public. Hindu pandit Morobhatt Dandekar summarized his arguments from his 1831 debate with Wilson in a Marathi-language work titled &quot;Shri-Hindu-dharma-sthapana&quot;. Narayana Rao, another Hindu apologist, wrote &quot;Svadesha-dharma-abhimani&quot; in response to Wilson.

In the mid-19th century, several Hindu apologist works were written in response to John Muir&#x27;s &quot;Mataparīkṣā&quot;. These include &quot;Mata-parīkṣā-śikṣā&quot; (1839) by Somanatha of Central India, &quot;Mataparīkṣottara&quot; (1840) by Harachandra Tarkapanchanan of Calcutta, &quot;Śāstra-tattva-vinirṇaya&quot; (1844-1845) by Nilakantha Gore of Benares, and a critique (published later in 1861 as part of &quot;Dharmādharma-parīkṣā-patra&quot;) by an unknown Vaishnava writer.

A range of Indian philosophers, including Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose, have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi have also tried to correlate recent developments from quantum physics and consciousness research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend Pandurang Shastri Athavale has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the Vedic tradition. In his book &quot;The Cradle of Civilization&quot;, David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like &quot;pyramids of the spirit&quot;.

===Islam===

&quot;&#x27;Ilm al-Kalām&quot;, literally &quot;science of discourse&quot;, usually foreshortened to &quot;kalam&quot; and sometimes called &quot;Islamic scholastic theology&quot;, is an Islamic undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against skeptics and detractors. A scholar of &quot;kalam&quot; is referred to as a &quot;mutakallim&quot; (plural &quot;mutakallimūn&quot;) as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists.

===Judaism===

Jewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as Aristobulus of Paneas, though some discern it in the works of Demetrius the chronographer (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of &quot;questions&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot; typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of Alexandria and the author of an apologetic work addressed to Ptolemy VI Philometor. Josephus&#x27;s Contra Apion is a wide-ranging defense of Judaism against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of Philo of Alexandria.

In response to modern Christian missionaries, and congregations that &quot;are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks&quot;, Jews for Judaism is the largest counter-missionary organization in existence, today. Kiruv Organization (Mizrachi), founded by Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi, and Outreach Judaism, founded by Rabbi Tovia Singer, are other prominent international organizations that respond &quot;directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity.&quot;

===Pantheism===
Some pantheists have formed organizations such as the World Pantheist Movement and the Universal Pantheist Society to promote and defend the belief in pantheism.

===Native Americans===
In a famous speech called &quot;Red Jacket on Religion for the White Man and the Red&quot; in 1805, Seneca chief Red Jacket gave an apologetic for Native American religion.

== In literature ==
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot; may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the prefaces and dedications, which proceed many Early Modern plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as Colley Cibber, Frances Burney, and William Congreve, to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author&#x27;s attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.

<text>Ranunculales is an order of flowering plants. Of necessity it contains the family Ranunculaceae, the buttercup family, because the name of the order is based on the name of a genus in that family. Ranunculales belongs to a paraphyletic group known as the basal eudicots. It is the most basal clade in this group; in other words, it is sister to the remaining eudicots. Widely known members include poppies, barberries, hellebores, and buttercups.

==Taxonomy==
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group recognized seven families in Ranunculales in their APG III system, published in 2009. In the preceding APG II system, they offered the option of three segregate families as shown below.
* order Ranunculales
*: family Berberidaceae
*: family Circaeasteraceae
*:: [+ family Kingdoniaceae ]
*: family Eupteleaceae
*: family Lardizabalaceae
*: family Menispermaceae
*: family Papaveraceae
*:: [+ family Fumariaceae ]
*:: [+ family Pteridophyllaceae ]
*: family Ranunculaceae
Note: &quot;+ ...&quot; = optionally separate family (that may be split off from the preceding family).

Under this definition, well-known members of Ranunculales include buttercups, clematis, columbines, delphiniums, and poppies.

A phylogeny of Ranunculales was published in 2009, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences. The authors of this paper revised the subfamilies and tribes of the order. This is reflected in the subsequent revision of the APG, APG IV (2016).

The analysis revealed that the order consisted of three clades, Eupteleaceae, Papaveraceae and a third clade, considered to be the &quot;core&quot; Ranuculales, consisting of the remaining five families. The phylogeny of the families is shown in the cladogram.
===Evolution===

The fossil form &quot;Leefructus&quot;, described in 2011, has been recognized as a member of this order. &quot;Leefructus mirus&quot; shows fully developed leaves; stem and flower that are very similar in structure to those of the modern buttercups. The fossil is dated to 125 Mya (million years old) and it not only proves that Ranunculales is an ancient group of eudicots but demonstrates that the whole angiosperm clade may be older than expected. The structure of the plant and its age may lead to a new approach regarding the field that studies the evolution of flowering plants. The fact that &quot;Leefructus&quot; shows a well-developed structure similar to modern ranunculids suggests that this group of eudicots may have developed earlier than the age of the fossil.

Another fossil has been described with the name &quot;Teixeiraea&quot;, also from the Cretaceous of Portugal. The genus &quot;Atli&quot; from the Late Cretaceous of Canada appears to have had a liana-like growth habit.

According to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Ranunculales split from other plants about 132 Mya or 140 Mya.

==History==
Historically the term Ranales was used to include the Ranunculaceae and related families, as described by Bentham and Hooker. This became replaced with Ranunculales by Melchior in 1964.

The Cronquist system (1981) also recognised the order, but placed it in the subclass Magnoliidae, in class Magnoliopsida [= dicotyledons]. It used this circumscription:
* order Ranunculales
*: family Ranunculaceae
*: family Circaeasteraceae
*: family Berberidaceae
*: family Sargentodoxaceae
*: family Lardizabalaceae
*: family Menispermaceae
*: family Coriariaceae
*: family Sabiaceae

In the Cronquist system, the Papaveraceae and Fumariaceae (including the plants in the optional family Pteridophyllaceae) were treated as a separate order Papaverales, placed in this same subclass Magnoliidae. The Cronquist circumscription of Ranunculales is now known to be polyphyletic. Sabiaceae is in a clade of basal eudicots separate from Ranunculales. Coriariaceae is now placed in the order Cucurbitales.

<text>Lexden is a suburb of Colchester and former civil parish, in the county of Essex, England. It was formerly a village, and has previously been called Lessendon, Lassendene and Læxadyne. In 2011 the ward had a population of 5,549.

Lexden is approximately one mile west of central Colchester. It is home to a public house, the Crown; and St Leonard&#x27;s Church (Church of England). The Leonard in question is Saint Leonard of Noblac, the patron saint of prisoners.

Lexden&#x27;s original name, Læxadyne, is Old English for &quot;Leaxa&#x27;s valley&quot;. It is referred to as the &quot;Hundred of LASSENDENE&quot; in the Domesday Book.

It is now cut into two halves by a modern bypass, Cymbeline Way, constructed in 1933. Within the space of a few hundred yards there are two 400-year-old watermills, (both now private residences), a 100-year-old iron bridge over the River Colne, two local nature reserves and several walks.

The area is covered by the Lexden ward and elects two councillors to sit on Colchester Borough Council.

==History==

The site on which Lexden now stands was crossed by the fortifications of Iron Age Colchester, the remains of the earthen ramparts can be seen at Bluebottle Grove, Lexden Park and alongside Straight Road. A number of burial mounds or tumuli remain, notably Lexden Tumulus in Fitzwalter Road which is reputed to be the burial place of Cunobelinus or Cymbeline, the king of the Catuvellauni. The Lexden Medallion was found when the tumulus was excavated in 1924 and is now in the Colchester Castle Museum. Another tumulus is The Mount in Marlowe Way, in which some fragments of Roman pottery and tiles have been found.

The parish church was founded early in the 12th century and a number of houses of medieval origins survive in Lexden Road (the A1124). Parts of The Sun Inn date from 1542 but it has recently become a private house.

In 1648, Lexden was the headquarters of Lord-General Thomas Fairfax during the Siege of Colchester, and his army camped on Lexden Heath. A Parliamentarian fort was built on Great Broom Heath (now called Hilly Fields) which overlooks the town.

During the 18th century a number of large houses were built including Lexden Park on the corner of Church Road, and the Manor House was rebuilt. The main road became a turnpike in 1707 and a cottage used as a toll house survives. Lexden Heath was a large area of common land used for grazing, horse races and military camps; it was inclosed by Act of Parliament in 1821. This enlarged the estate of the lord of the manor, the Reverend John Rawstorn Papillon, who was an acquaintance of Jane Austen and whose niece married Jane&#x27;s brother Henry. Straight Road was created at this time to make a way across the new inclosures to the hamlet of Shrub End, which became a separate parish in 1845.

The small and decrepit medieval church of St Leonard was demolished in 1820 and a new church was built slightly to the south, designed in the Early English style by M. G. Thompson. A larger chancel was added in 1892. A Methodist chapel was built in Straight Road in 1859 and a mission hall (now Lexden Evangelical Church) in 1885.

A National Day and Sunday School was built in Spring Lane in 1817 and enlarged several times until replaced by Lexden Council School (now Lexden Primary) in 1925. Lexden Park House became the Endsleigh private school in 1955 and then the Endsleigh Annex of the Colchester Institute until 1990. The house itself was converted to apartments and the gardens became a local nature reserve. The Avenue of Remembrance was built in 1933 to relieve traffic on the London Road and as a memorial to the fallen of Colchester in World War I.

Charles Henry Harrod, a businessman involved in retail trade who founded the highly successful Harrods store in London, was born in Lexden.

In 1891 the parish had a population of 3562. On 26 March 1897 the parish was abolished to form Colchester. Lexden is mentioned in the Domesday Book.

==Education==
In Lexden, there is one private school, Holmwood House School, which was founded in 1922 and has around three hundred pupils from reception to year eight. St Teresa&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is an academy school with around two hundred and twenty pupils from reception to year six. Lexden Primary School and Home Farm Primary School are state schools for all children from nursery to year six, Lexden also having a special unit for the hearing impaired. There is also a school for children with special needs, Lexden Springs School.

Providing secondary education, the Colchester Royal Grammar School, Colchester County High School for Girls, Philip Morant School and College and St Mary&#x27;s School, Colchester are nearby.

==Sports and recreation==
Lexden has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V.

==Electoral ward==

The suburb was covered by the Lexden ward and elected 2 councillors to sit on Colchester Borough Council. The ward was previously represented by 3 councillors from 1976 to 2002.

The ward was abolished at the 2016 election and parts were amalgamated with the enlarged Prettygate ward and the new Lexden &amp; Braiswick ward.

<doc id="246918" wikidata="Q7524254" url="?curid=246918" title="Singular term">
<text>A singular term is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects. They contrast with &quot;general terms&quot; (such as &quot;car&quot; or &quot;chair&quot;) which can apply to more than one thing.

Singular terms are of philosophical importance for philosophers of language, because they &quot;refer&quot; to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

==Overview==

There are various kinds of singular terms: proper names (e.g. &quot;Matthew&quot;), definite descriptions (e.g. &quot;the second fisherman in the boat&quot;), singular personal pronouns (e.g. &quot;she&quot;), demonstrative pronouns (e.g. &quot;this&quot;), etc.

Historically, various definitions for &quot;singular term&quot; have been offered:

# A term that tells us which individual is being talked about. (John Stuart Mill, Arthur Prior, P. F. Strawson) 
# A term that is grammatically singular, i.e. a proper name (&quot;proprium nomen&quot;), a demonstrative pronoun (&quot;pronomen demonstrativum&quot;) or a demonstrative pronoun with a common name (&quot;cum termino communi&quot;). (William of Ockham)
# A term that is inherently &quot;about&quot; the object to which it applies or refers. (Gottlob Frege) 
# A term that is true &quot;in the same sense&quot; of only one object. (Peter of Spain)

<text>Visa Inc. () is an American multinational payment card services corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. 

Visa does not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for consumers; rather, Visa provides financial institutions with Visa-branded payment products that they then use to offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs to their customers. In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa&#x27;s global network (known as VisaNet) processed 100 billion transactions during 2014 with a total volume of US$6.8 trillion.

Visa was founded in 1958 by Bank of America (BofA) as the BankAmericard credit card program. In response to competitor Master Charge (now Mastercard), BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in 1966. By 1970, BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program, forming a cooperative with the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.

Nearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company&#x27;s directly operated VisaNet at one of four secure data centers, located in Ashburn, Virginia and Highlands Ranch, Colorado in the United States; London, England; and in Singapore. These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second.

Visa is the world&#x27;s second-largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined), after being surpassed by China UnionPay in 2015, based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards. However, because UnionPay&#x27;s size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market in China, Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world, where it commands a 50% market share of total card payments.

==History==

On September 18, 1958, Bank of America (BofA) officially launched its BankAmericard credit card program in Fresno, California. In the weeks leading up to the launch of BankAmericard, BofA had saturated Fresno mailboxes with an initial mass mailing (or &quot;drop&quot;, as they came to be called) of 65,000 unsolicited credit cards. BankAmericard was the brainchild of BofA&#x27;s in-house product development think tank, the Customer Services Research Group, and its leader, Joseph P. Williams. Williams convinced senior BofA executives in 1956 to let him pursue what became the world&#x27;s first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards (actual working cards, not mere applications) to a large population.

Williams&#x27; pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the all-purpose credit card (in the sense that his project was not canceled outright), not in coming up with the idea. By the mid-1950s, the typical middle-class American already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants, which was clearly inconvenient and inefficient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month. The need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the American financial services industry, but no one could figure out how to do it. There were already charge cards like Diners Club (which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle), and &quot;by the mid-1950s, there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an all-purpose credit card.&quot; However, these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work. Williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks&#x27; mistakes; they also studied existing revolving credit operations at Sears and Mobil Oil to learn why they were successful. Fresno was selected for its population of 250,000 (big enough to make a credit card work, small enough to control initial startup cost), BofA&#x27;s market share of that population (45%), and relative isolation, to control public relations damage in case the project failed. According to Williams, Florsheim Shoes was the first major retail chain which agreed to accept BankAmericard at its stores.

The 1958 test at first went smoothly, but then BofA panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in San Francisco, BofA&#x27;s home market. By March 1959, drops began in San Francisco and Sacramento; by June, BofA was dropping cards in Los Angeles; by October, the entire state of California had been saturated with over 2 million credit cards and BankAmericard was being accepted by 20,000 merchants. However, the program was riddled with problems, as Williams (who had never worked in a bank&#x27;s loan department) had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the bank&#x27;s customers, and he resigned in December 1959. Twenty-two percent of accounts were delinquent, not the 4% expected, and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud. Both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against Bank of America and its newfangled credit card, especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges, even those resulting from fraud. BofA officially lost over $8.8 million on the launch of BankAmericard, but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included, the bank&#x27;s actual loss was probably around $20 million.

However, after Williams and some of his closest associates left, BofA management realized that BankAmericard was salvageable. They conducted a &quot;massive effort&quot; to clean up after Williams, imposed proper financial controls, published an open letter to 3 million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work. By May 1961, the BankAmericard program became profitable for the first time. At the time, BofA deliberately kept this information secret and allowed then-widespread negative impressions to linger in order to ward off competition. This strategy worked until 1966, when BankAmericard&#x27;s profitability had become far too big to hide.

The original goal of BofA was to offer the BankAmericard product across California, but in 1966, BofA began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of California, in response to a new competitor, Master Charge (now Mastercard), which had been created by an alliance of several regional bankcard associations to compete against BankAmericard. BofA itself (like all other U.S. banks at the time) could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until 1994. Over the following 11 years, various banks licensed the card system from Bank of America, thus forming a network of banks backing the BankAmericard system across the United States. The &quot;drops&quot; of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated, thanks to BofA and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in 1970, but not before over 100 million credit cards had been distributed into the American population.

During the late 1960s, BofA also licensed the BankAmericard program to banks in several other countries, which began issuing cards with localized brand names. For example:
* In Canada, an alliance of banks (including Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, Banque Canadienne Nationale and Bank of Nova Scotia) issued credit cards under the &quot;Chargex&quot; name from 1968 to 1977.
* In France, it was known as &quot;Carte Bleue&quot; (Blue Card). The logo still appears on many French-issued Visa cards today.
* In Japan, The Sumitomo Bank issued BankAmericards through the Sumitomo Credit Service.
* In the UK, the only BankAmericard issuer for some years was Barclaycard. The branding still exists today, but is used not only on Visa cards issued by Barclays, but on its MasterCard and American Express cards as well.
* In Spain until 1979 the only issuer was Banco de Bilbao.

In 1968, a manager at the National Bank of Commerce (later Rainier Bancorp), Dee Hock, was asked to supervise that bank&#x27;s launch of its own licensed version of BankAmericard in the Pacific Northwest market. Although Bank of America had cultivated the public image that BankAmericard&#x27;s troubled startup issues were now safely in the past, Hock realized that the BankAmericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; fashion. For example, &quot;interchange&quot; transaction issues &quot;between&quot; banks were becoming a very serious problem, which had not been seen before when Bank of America was the sole issuer of BankAmericards. Hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program; they promptly made him the chair of that committee.

After lengthy negotiations, the committee led by Hock was able to persuade Bank of America that a bright future lay ahead for BankAmericard — outside Bank of America. In June 1970, Bank of America gave up control of the BankAmericard program. The various BankAmericard issuer banks took control of the program, creating National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), an independent Delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing, promoting and developing the BankAmericard system within the United States. In other words, BankAmericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance, like its competitor Master Charge. Hock became NBI&#x27;s first president and CEO.

However, Bank of America retained the right to directly license BankAmericard to banks outside the United States and continued to issue and support such licenses. By 1972, licenses had been granted in 15 countries. The international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs, and they hired Hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with BofA as he had done for the domestic licensees. As a result, in 1974, the International Bankcard Company (IBANCO), a multinational member corporation, was founded in order to manage the international BankAmericard program.

In 1976, the directors of IBANCO determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation; however, in many countries, there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with Bank of America, even though the association was entirely nominal in nature. For this reason, in 1976, BankAmericard, Barclaycard, Carte Bleue, Chargex, Sumitomo Card, and all other licensees united under the new name, &quot;Visa&quot;, which retained the distinctive blue, white and gold flag. NBI became Visa USA and IBANCO became Visa International.

The term &quot;Visa&quot; was conceived by the company&#x27;s founder, Dee Hock. He believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptance.

The announcement of the transition came on December 16, 1976, with VISA cards to replace expiring BankAmericard cards starting on March 1, 1977 (initially with both the BankAmericard name and the VISA name on the same card), and the various Bank of America issued cards worldwide being phased out by the end of October 1979.

In October 2007, Bank of America announced it was resurrecting the BankAmericard brand name as the &quot;BankAmericard Rewards Visa&quot;.

In March 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Visa announced that it would suspend all business operations in Russia.

===Corporate structure===
Prior to October 3, 2007, Visa comprised four non-stock, separately incorporated companies that employed 6,000 people worldwide: the worldwide parent entity Visa International Service Association (Visa), Visa USA Inc., Visa Canada Association, and Visa Europe Ltd. The latter three separately incorporated regions had the status of group members of Visa International Service Association.

The unincorporated regions Visa Latin America (LAC), Visa Asia Pacific and Visa Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) were divisions within Visa.

===Billing and finance charge methods===
Initially, signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customer&#x27;s monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as &quot;country club billing&quot;. By the late 1970s, however, billing statements no longer contained these enclosures, but rather a summary statement showing posting date, purchase date, reference number, merchant name, and the dollar amount of each purchase. At the same time, many issuers, particularly Bank of America, were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation. Initially, a &quot;previous balance&quot; method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month&#x27;s statement. Later, it was decided to use &quot;average daily balance&quot; which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior month&#x27;s statement. Several years later, &quot;new average daily balance&quot;—in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced. By the early 1980s, many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer.

===IPO and restructuring===
On October 11, 2006, Visa announced that some of its businesses would be merged and become a publicly traded company, Visa Inc.
Under the IPO restructuring, Visa Canada, Visa International, and Visa USA were merged into the new public company. Visa&#x27;s Western Europe operation became a separate company, owned by its member banks who will also have a minority stake in Visa Inc. In total, more than 35 investment banks participated in the deal in several capacities, most notably as underwriters.

On October 3, 2007, Visa completed its corporate restructuring with the formation of Visa Inc. The new company was the first step towards Visa&#x27;s IPO. The second step came on November 9, 2007, when the new Visa Inc. submitted its $10 billion IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On February 25, 2008, Visa announced it would go ahead with an IPO of half its shares. The IPO took place on March 18, 2008. Visa sold 406 million shares at US$44 per share ($2 above the high end of the expected $37–42 pricing range), raising US$17.9 billion in what was then the largest initial public offering in U.S. history. On March 20, 2008, the IPO underwriters (including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Bank of America Securities LLC, Citi, HSBC, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., UBS Investment Bank and Wachovia Securities) exercised their overallotment option, purchasing an additional 40.6 million shares, bringing Visa&#x27;s total IPO share count to 446.6 million, and bringing the total proceeds to US$19.1 billion. Visa now trades under the ticker symbol &quot;V&quot; on the New York Stock Exchange.

===Visa Europe===

Visa Europe Ltd. was a membership association and cooperative of over 3,700 European banks and other payment service providers that operated Visa branded products and services within Europe. Visa Europe was a company entirely separate from Visa Inc. having gained independence of Visa International Service Association in October 2007 when Visa Inc. became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Visa Inc. announced the plan to acquire Visa Europe on November 2, 2015, creating a single global company. On April 21, 2016, the agreement was amended in response to the feedback of European Commission. The acquisition of Visa Europe was completed on June 21, 2016.

=== Failed acquisition of Plaid ===
On January 13, 2020, Plaid announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Visa for $5.3 billion. The deal was double the company&#x27;s most recent Series C round valuation of $2.65 billion, and was expected to close in the next 3–6 months, subject to regulatory review and closing conditions. According to the deal, Visa would pay $4.9 billion in cash and approximately $400 million of retention equity and deferred equity, according to a presentation deck prepared by Visa.

On November 5, 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to block the acquisition, arguing that Visa is a monopolist trying to eliminate a competitive threat by purchasing Plaid. Visa said it disagrees with the lawsuit and &quot;intends to defend the transaction vigorously.&quot; On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid announced they had abandoned the deal.

===Digital currencies===
On February 3, 2021, Visa announced a partnership with First Boulevard, a neobank promoting cryptocurrency, which has been touted as a means of building generational wealth for Black Americans. The partnership would allow their users to buy, sell, hold, and trade digital assets through Anchorage Digital.

On March 29, 2021, Visa announced the acceptance of stablecoin USDC to settle transactions on its network.

===Visa Foundation===
Registered in the United States as a 501(c)(3) entity, the Visa Foundation was created with the mission of supporting inclusive economies. In particular, economies in which individuals, businesses and communities can thrive with the support of grants and investments. Supporting resiliency, as well as the growth, of micro and small businesses that benefit women is a priority of the Visa Foundation. Furthermore, the Foundation prioritizes providing support to the community from a broad standpoint, as well as responding to disasters during crisis.

===Other initiatives===

In December 2020, Visa Announced the launch of a new accelerator program across Asia Pacific to further develop the region&#x27;s financial technology ecosystem. The accelerator program aims to find and partner with startup companies providing financial and payments technologies that could potentially leverage on Visa&#x27;s network of bank and merchant partners in the region.

== Finance ==

For the fiscal year 2022, Visa reported earnings of US$14.96 billion, with an annual revenue of US$29.31 billion, an increase of 21.6% over the previous fiscal cycle. As of 2022, the company ranked 147th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. Visa&#x27;s shares traded at over $143 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$280.2 billion in September 2018.
==Criticism and controversy==

===WikiLeaks===
Visa Europe began suspending payments to WikiLeaks on December 7, 2010. The company said it was awaiting an investigation into &#x27;the nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating rules&#x27; – though it did not go into details. In return DataCell, the IT company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations, announced that it would take legal action against Visa Europe. On December 8, the group Anonymous performed a DDoS attack on visa.com, bringing the site down. Although the Norway-based financial services company Teller AS, which Visa ordered to look into WikiLeaks and its fundraising body, the Sunshine Press, found no proof of any wrongdoing, &quot;Salon&quot; reported in January 2011 that Visa Europe &quot;would continue blocking donations to the secret-spilling site until it completes its own investigation&quot;.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that Visa may be &quot;violating WikiLeaks&#x27; right to freedom of expression&quot; by withdrawing their services.

In July 2012, the Reykjavík District Court in Iceland decided that Valitor (the Icelandic partner of Visa and MasterCard) was violating the law when it prevented donations to the site by credit card. It was ruled that the donations be allowed to return to the site within 14 days or they would be fined in the amount of US$6,000 per day.

=== Litigation and regulatory actions ===
==== United States ====

===== Antitrust lawsuit by ATM operators =====
In 2011, MasterCard and Visa were sued in a class action by ATM operators claiming the credit card networks&#x27; rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claimed that this is a restraint on trade in violation of US federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard&#x27;s and Visa&#x27;s network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price-fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act&#x27;s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade.

Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, &quot;Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay.&quot;

In 2017, a US district court denied the ATM operators&#x27; request to stop Visa from enforcing the ATM fees.

===== Debit card swipe fees =====
In 1996, a class of U.S. merchants, including Walmart, brought an antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard over their &quot;Honor All Cards&quot; policy, which forced merchants who accepted Visa and MasterCard branded credit cards to also accept their respective debit cards (such as the &quot;Visa Check Card&quot;). Over 4 million class members were represented by the plaintiffs. According to a website associated with the suit, Visa and MasterCard settled the plaintiffs&#x27; claims in 2003 for a total of $3.05 billion. Visa&#x27;s share of this settlement is reported to have been the larger.

===== U.S. Justice Department actions =====
In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Visa over rules prohibiting its issuing banks from doing business with American Express and Discover. The Department of Justice won its case at trial in 2001 and the verdict was upheld on appeal. American Express and Discover filed suit as well.

In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the Department of Justice in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.

===== Payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation =====

On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against Mastercard and Visa. The suit was filed due to alleged price-fixing practices employed by Mastercard and Visa. About one-quarter of the named class plaintiffs have decided to opt &quot;out of the settlement&quot;. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement.

Plaintiffs allege that Visa and Mastercard fixed interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.

A settlement of US$6.24 billion has been reached and a court is scheduled to approve or deny the agreement on November 7, 2019.

===== Confrontation with Walmart over high fees =====
In June 2016, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Walmart threatened to stop accepting Visa cards in Canada. Visa objected saying that consumers should not be dragged into a dispute between the companies. In January 2017, Walmart Canada and Visa reached a deal to allow the continued acceptance of Visa.

===== Dispute with Kroger over high credit card fees =====
In March 2019, U.S. retailer Kroger announced that its 250-strong Smith&#x27;s chain would stop accepting Visa credit cards as of April 3, 2019, due to the cards&#x27; high swipe fees. Kroger&#x27;s California-based Foods Co stores stopped accepting Visa cards in August 2018. Mike Schlotman, Kroger&#x27;s executive vice president/chief financial officer, said Visa had been &quot;misusing its position and charging retailers excessive fees for a long time.&quot; In response, Visa issued a statement saying it was &quot;unfair and disappointing that Kroger is putting shoppers in the middle of a business dispute.&quot; As of October 31, 2019, Kroger has settled their dispute with Visa and is now accepting the payment method.

===== 2020 Antitrust lawsuit challenging acquisition of Plaid =====
In January 2020 Visa announced it would acquire Plaid for $5.3 billion. In November 2020, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) sued to block Visa&#x27;s acquisition of fintech startup Plaid, claiming that the merger would violate antitrust laws. The DOJ argues that the merger would eliminate Plaid&#x27;s potential ability to compete in the online debit market, thereby creating a monopoly for Visa. Visa CEO at the time Alfred Kelly described the acquisition bid as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; to neutralize a &quot;threat to our important US debit business.&quot; In January 2021, Visa along with Plaid both mutually agreed to abandon its proposed acquisition.

===== 2021 Antitrust investigation over debit card practices =====
In March 2021, the United States Justice Department announced its investigation with Visa to discover if the company is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit card market. The main question at hand is whether or not Visa is limiting merchants&#x27; ability to route debit card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, focusing more so on online debit card transactions. The probe highlights the role of network fees, which are invisible to consumers and place pressure on merchants, who mitigate the fees by raising prices of goods for customers. The probe was confirmed through a regulatory filing on March 19, 2021, stating they will be cooperating with the Justice Department. Visa&#x27;s shares fell more than 6% following the announcement. On September 24, 2024, the Justice Department sued Visa, alleging that Visa used illegal tactics to maintain a monopoly in debit-card payments.

==== Outside of the United States ====

===== Anti-competitive conduct in Australia =====
In 2015, the Australian Federal Court ordered Visa to pay a pecuniary penalty of $20 million (including legal fees) for engaging in anti-competitive conduct against dynamic currency conversion operators, in proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

===== Antitrust issues in Europe =====
In 2002, the European Commission exempted Visa&#x27;s multilateral interchange fees from Article 81 of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti-competitive arrangements. However, this exemption expired on December 31, 2007. In the United Kingdom, Mastercard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.

In January 2007, the European Commission issued the results of a two-year inquiry into the retail banking sector. The report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees. Upon publishing the report, Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the &quot;present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified.&quot; The report called for further study of the issue.

On March 26, 2008, the European Commission opened an investigation into Visa&#x27;s multilateral interchange fees for cross-border transactions within the EEA as well as into the &quot;Honor All Cards&quot; rule (under which merchants are required to accept all valid Visa-branded cards).

The antitrust authorities of EU member states (other than the United Kingdom) also investigated Mastercard&#x27;s and Visa&#x27;s interchange fees. For example, on January 4, 2007, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection fined twenty banks a total of PLN 164 million (about $56 million) for jointly setting Mastercard&#x27;s and Visa&#x27;s interchange fees.

In December 2010, Visa reached a settlement with the European Union in yet another antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card payments to 0.2 percent of a purchase. A senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/Mastercard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). After Visa&#x27;s blocking of payments to WikiLeaks, members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the US, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and Mastercard in the European payment system.

===== High swipe fees in Poland =====
Visa&#x27;s interchange fee of 1.5–1.6% in Poland started discussion about the need for increased government regulation surrounding the topic. The high fees encouraged merchants to create new payment systems, which avoid using Visa as a middleman. For example, mobile applications were created by major banks, proprietary payment systems were created by franchises, and public transport authorities created ticketing systems.

===== UK Payment System Regulator =====
In May 2024, the UK Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) proposed new rules requiring Visa and Mastercard to increase transparency regarding the fees they charge merchants. The proposed regulations mandate that the two companies, regularly disclose detailed financial information to the PSR. The regulations also require Visa and Mastercard to consult with merchants and retailers before implementing any fee changes.

The proposal followed a PSR review revealing that Visa and Mastercard had raised their scheme and processing fees by more than 30% in real terms over the previous five years. Despite these increases, the PSR found limited evidence that service quality had improved proportionately.

===== European Commission investigation into scheme fees =====
In November 2024, The European Commission launched an investigation into whether the scheme fees imposed by Visa and Mastercard negatively impact retailers. LINK 40 Some retailers have recently complained about the fees, citing a lack of transparency.

==Corporate affairs==
===Headquarters===
Visa was traditionally headquartered in San Francisco until 1985, when it moved to San Mateo. Around 1993, Visa began consolidating various scattered offices in San Mateo to a location in nearby Foster City. Visa became Foster City&#x27;s largest employer.

In 2009, Visa moved its corporate headquarters back to San Francisco when it leased the top three floors of the 595 Market Street office building, although most of its employees remained at its Foster City campus. In 2012, Visa decided to consolidate its headquarters in Foster City where 3,100 of its 7,700 global workers are employed. Visa owns four buildings at the intersection of Metro Center Boulevard and Vintage Park Drive.

As of October 1, 2012, Visa&#x27;s headquarters were located in Foster City. In December 2012, Visa Inc. confirmed that it will build a global information technology center off of the US 183 Expressway in northwest Austin, Texas. By 2019, Visa had leased space in four buildings near Austin and employed nearly 2,000 people.

On November 6, 2019, Visa announced plans to move its headquarters back to San Francisco by 2024 upon completion of a new &quot;13-story, 300,000-square-foot building&quot;. Visa also announced that it would redesign its current four-building complex in Foster City to 575,000 square feet, for offices for 3,000 employees in its product and technology teams. The existing complex has over 970,000 square feet of space, but Visa declined to explain how it would dispose of almost 400,000 square feet of excess space.

On June 6, 2024, Visa opened its new headquarters building at 300 Toni Stone Crossing in the Mission Rock development in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission Bay neighborhood. The building was officially designated as the Market Support Center on its opening date, rather than a &quot;headquarters&quot; building as indicated in its original 2019 announcement. The company&#x27;s 2024 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission designate a post office box as its official address. Despite that ambiguity, the office of Visa&#x27;s chief executive officer is based in the Market Support Center. The building features outdoor terraces, a rooftop deck, and views of San Francisco Giants baseball games and other events at Oracle Park across McCovey Cove. 

=== Ownership ===
Visa is mainly owned by institutional investors, who own over 95% of shares. The largest shareholders in December 2023 were:

* The Vanguard Group (8.94%)
* BlackRock (7.99%)
* State Street Corporation (4.64%)
* Fidelity Investments (3.26%)
* Morgan Stanley (3.26%)
* T. Rowe Price (2.85%)
* Geode Capital Management (2.15%)
* Bank of America (1.53%)
* AllianceBernstein (1.46%)
* Capital International Investors (1.45%)

==Operations==
Visa offers through its issuing members the following types of cards:
* Debit cards (pay from a checking/savings account)
* Credit cards (pay monthly payments with or without interest depending on a customer paying on time)
* Prepaid cards (pay from a cash account that has no check writing privileges)

Visa operates the Plus automated teller machine network and the Interlink EFTPOS point-of-sale network, which facilitate the &quot;debit&quot; protocol used with debit cards and prepaid cards. They also provide commercial payment solutions for small businesses, midsize and large corporations, and governments.

Visa teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple&#x27;s new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their Visa, and other credit/debit cards.

===Operating regulations===
Visa has a set of rules that govern the participation of financial institutions in its payment system. Acquiring banks are responsible for ensuring that their merchants comply with the rules.

Rules address how a cardholder must be identified for security, how transactions may be denied by the bank, and how banks may cooperate for fraud prevention, and how to keep that identification and fraud protection standard and non-discriminatory. Other rules govern what creates an enforceable proof of authorization by the cardholder.

The rules prohibit merchants from imposing a minimum or maximum purchase amount in order to accept a Visa card and from charging cardholders a fee for using a Visa card. In ten U.S. states, surcharges for the use of a credit card are forbidden by law (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) but a discount for cash is permitted under specific rules. Some countries have banned the no-surcharge rule, most notably in Australia retailers may apply surcharges to any credit-card transaction, Visa or otherwise. In the UK the law was changed in January 2018 to prevent retailers from adding a surcharge to a transaction as per &#x27;The Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012&#x27;.

Visa permits merchants to ask for photo ID, although the merchant rule book states that this practice is discouraged. As long as the Visa card is signed, a merchant may not deny a transaction because a cardholder refuses to show a photo ID.

The Dodd–Frank Act allows U.S. merchants to set a minimum purchase amount on credit card transactions, not to exceed $10.

Recent complications include the addition of exceptions for non-signed purchases by telephone or on the Internet and an additional security system called &quot;Verified by Visa&quot; for purchases on the Internet.

In September 2014, Visa Inc, launched a new service to replace account information on plastic cards with tokens – a digital account number.

== Products ==
===Visa Credit Cards===
Depending on the geographical location, Visa card issuers issue the following tiers of cards, from the lowest to the highest:
* Traditional/Classic/Standard
* Gold
* Platinum
* Premier (France only)
* Signature (Worldwide except Canada)
* Infinite
* Infinite Privilege (Canada only)

===Visa Debit===

This is the standard Visa-branded debit card.

=== Visa Electron ===

A Visa-branded debit card issued worldwide since the 1990s. Its distinguishing feature is that it does not allow &quot;card not present&quot; transactions while its floor limit is set to zero, which triggers automatic authorisation of each transaction with the issuing bank and effectively makes it impossible for the user to overdraw the account. The card has often been issued to younger customers or those who may pose a risk of overdrawing the account. Since mid-2000s, the card has mostly been replaced by Visa Debit.

=== Visa Cash ===

A Visa-branded stored-value card.

===Visa Contactless (Visa payWave)===

In September 2007, Visa introduced Visa payWave, a contactless payment technology feature that allows cardholders to wave their card in front of contactless payment terminals without the need to physically swipe or insert the card into a point-of-sale device. This is similar to the Mastercard Contactless service and the American Express ExpressPay, with both using RFID technology. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right.

In Europe, Visa has introduced the V Pay card, which is a chip-only and PIN-only debit card. In Australia, take up has been the highest in the world, with more than 50% of in store Visa transactions now made by Visa payWave.

===mVisa===
mVisa is a mobile payment app allowing payment via smartphones using QR code. This QR code payment method was first introduced in India in 2015. It was later expanded to a number of other countries, including in Africa and South East Asia.

===Visa Checkout===
In 2013, Visa launched Visa Checkout, an online payment system that removes the need to share card details with retailers. The Visa Checkout service allows users to enter all their personal details and card information, then use a single username and password to make purchases from online retailers. The service works with Visa credit, debit, and prepaid cards. On November 27, 2013, V.me went live in the UK, France, Spain and Poland, with Nationwide Building Society being the first financial institution in Britain to support it, although Nationwide subsequently withdrew this service in 2016.

=== Visa Commerce Network ===
After Visa&#x27;s acquisition of TrialPay on February 27, 2015, Visa created the Visa Commerce Network. Visa Commerce Network provides businesses the ability to provide rewards, through the use of loyalty programs. 

==Trademark and design==

===Logo design===
The blue and gold in Visa&#x27;s logo were chosen to represent the blue sky and gold-colored hills of California, where the Bank of America was founded.

In 2005, Visa changed its logo, removing the horizontal stripes in favor of a simple white background with the name Visa in blue with an orange flick on the &#x27;V&#x27;. The orange flick was removed in favor of the logo being a solid blue gradient in 2014 and solid blue in 2021. In 2015, the gold and blue stripes were restored as card branding on Visa Debit and Visa Electron, although not as the company&#x27;s logotype.

===Card design===
In 1983, most Visa cards around the world began to feature a hologram of a dove on its face, generally under the last four digits of the Visa number. This was implemented as a security feature – true holograms would appear three-dimensional and the image would change as the card was turned. At the same time, the Visa logo, which had previously covered the whole card face, was reduced in size to a strip on the card&#x27;s right incorporating the hologram. This allowed issuing banks to customize the appearance of the card. Similar changes were implemented with MasterCard cards. Today, cards may be co-branded with various merchants, airlines, etc., and marketed as &quot;reward cards&quot;.

On older Visa cards, holding the face of the card under an ultraviolet light will reveal the dove picture, dubbed the Ultra-Sensitive Dove, as an additional security test. (On newer Visa cards, the UV dove is replaced by a small V over the Visa logo.)

Beginning in 2005, the Visa standard was changed to allow for the hologram to be placed on the back of the card, or to be replaced with a holographic magnetic stripe (&quot;HoloMag&quot;). The HoloMag card was shown to occasionally cause interference with card readers, so Visa eventually withdrew designs of HoloMag cards and reverted to traditional magnetic strips.

==Signatures==
Visa made a statement on January 12, 2018, that the signature requirement would become optional for all EMV contact or contactless chip-enabled merchants in North America starting in April 2018. It was noted that the signatures are no longer necessary to fight fraud and the fraud capabilities have advanced allowing this elimination leading to a faster in-store purchase experience. Visa was the last of the major credit card issuers to relax the signature requirements. The first to eliminate the signature was MasterCard Inc. followed by Discover Financial Services and American Express Co.

<doc id="246921" wikidata="Q215512" url="?curid=246921" title="Levi">
<text>Levi ( ; ) was, according to the Book of Genesis, the third of the six sons of Jacob and Leah (Jacob&#x27;s third son), and the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Levi (the Levites, including the Kohanim) and the great-grandfather of Aaron, Moses and Miriam. Certain religious and political functions were reserved for the Levites.

Most scholars view the Torah as projecting the origins of the Levites into the past to explain their role as landless cultic functionaries.

==Origins==
The Torah suggests that the name &quot;Levi&quot; refers to Leah&#x27;s hope for Jacob to &quot;join&quot; with her, implying a derivation from Hebrew &quot;yillaweh&quot;, meaning &quot;he will join&quot;, but scholars suspect that it may simply mean &quot;priest&quot;, either as a loanword or by referring to those people who were &quot;joined&quot; to the Ark of the Covenant. Another possibility is that the Levites were a tribe of Judah not from the clan of Moses or Aaron and that the name &quot;Levites&quot; indicates their &quot;joining&quot; - either with the Israelites in general or with the earlier Israelite priesthood in particular.

The Book of Jubilees states that Levi was born &quot;in the new moon of the first month&quot;, which means that he was born on 1 Nisan.

==Levi and the &quot;Blessing of Jacob&quot;==
In the Book of Genesis, Levi and his brother, Simeon, exterminate the city of Shechem in revenge for the rape of Dinah, seizing the wealth of the city and killing the men. The brothers had earlier misled the inhabitants by consenting to Dinah&#x27;s rapist marrying her in exchange for the men of the city to be circumcised, and when Jacob hears about their destruction of Shechem, he castigates them for it. In the Blessing of Jacob, Jacob is described as imposing a curse on the Levites, by which they would be scattered, in punishment for Levi&#x27;s actions in Shechem.

Some textual scholars date the Blessing of Jacob to a period between one and two centuries before the Babylonian captivity, and some Biblical scholars regard the curse, and Dinah herself, as an aetiological postdiction to explain the fates of the tribe of Simeon and the Levites, with one possible explanation of the Levites&#x27; scattered nature being that the priesthood was originally open to any tribe but gradually became seen as a distinct tribe itself. Nevertheless, Isaac, Levi&#x27;s grandfather, gives a special blessing about the lineage of priests of God.

==The family of Levi==
In the Book of Genesis, Levi is described as having fathered three sons—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. A similar genealogy is given in the Book of Exodus, where it is added that among Kohath&#x27;s sons was one—Amram—who married a woman named Jochebed, who was closely related to his father, and they were the biological parents of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; though some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Torah state that Jochebed was Amram&#x27;s father&#x27;s cousin, the Masoretic Text states that she was his father&#x27;s sister, and the Septuagint mentions that she was &quot;one of&quot; his &quot;father&#x27;s sisters&quot;. The Masoretic Text&#x27;s version of Levi&#x27;s genealogy thus implies (and in Numbers 26:59, explicitly states) that Levi also had a daughter (Jochebed), and the Septuagint implies further daughters. The names of Levi&#x27;s sons, and possible daughter, are interpreted in classical rabbinical literature as being reflections on their future destiny. In some apocryphal texts such as the &quot;Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, and the Book of Jubilees, Levi&#x27;s wife, his children&#x27;s mother, is named as &quot;Milkah&quot;, a daughter of Aram, but according to the Book of Jasher, the name of Levi&#x27;s wife was Adinah.

===Family tree===






==In post-Torah tradition==

In accordance with his role as founder of the Levites, Levi is referred to as being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which haggadah take to support the characterization of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal &quot;Prayer of Asenath&quot;, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD, describes Levi as a prophet and saint who is able to forecast the future and understand heavenly writings, and as someone who admonishes the people to forgive and to be in awe of God. The Book of Malachi argues that Yahweh chose the Levites to be priests because Levi, as God&#x27;s minister, embodied true religious principles, possessed reverence for Yahweh, held the divine name in awe, upheld peace, provided a model of good morality, and turned many people away from sin.

===Testament of Levi===

The Testament of Levi is believed to have been written between 153 BC and 107 BC, and closer to the latter date. 
On his deathbed, Levi gathered all his children to narrate the story of his life to them, and prophesied unto them what they would do, and what would happen to them until judgment day. He also told them that God had chosen him and his seed as priest of Lord unto eternity. In this testament, Levi is described as having had two visions. The first vision covered eschatological issues, portraying the seven heavens, the Jewish Messiah, and Judgement Day. The second vision portrays seven angels bringing Levi seven insignia signifying priesthood, prophecy, and judgement; in the vision, after the angels anoint Levi, and initiate him as a priest, they tell him of the future of his descendants, mentioning Moses, the Aaronid priesthood, and a time when there would be priest-kings; this latter point was of particular interest to the Maccabean period of John Hyrcanus, who was both a high priest, and warrior-king.

The Book of Jubilees similarly has Isaac telling Levi of the future of his descendants, again predicting priesthood, prophets, and political power, and additionally describes Jacob as entrusting Levi with &quot;the secrets of the ancients&quot;, so that they would be known only to the Levites; however, like the Testament of Levi, the Book of Jubilees is regarded as a Maccabean-era document.

== Tomb ==
A Samaritan tradition recorded in the late 19th century considered Neby Lawin, just north of Silat ad-Dhahr to be the burial place of Levi.

<text>Deggendorf is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bordered by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Regen, Freyung-Grafenau, Passau, Rottal-Inn, Dingolfing-Landau and Straubing-Bogen.

==History==
The district was established in 1936. Minor changes of the borders in 1972 led to the present form of the district.

==Geography==
The Danube river runs through the district from west to east, dividing it into two unequal regions. North of the Danube the Bavarian Forest rises steeply. In the south there is relatively plain countryside. The Isar river enters the district in the south and meets the Danube close to the town of Deggendorf. The Einödriegel (1,220 m) is the highest point within the county.

==Coat of arms==
The double eagle was the symbol of the monastery of Metten, which was the first Christian outpost in the region. The blue line stands for the river Danube, the green hills symbolise the Bavarian Forest.

<text>Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump is a buffalo jump west of Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada, on Highway 785. The site is in an area where the foothills of the Rocky Mountains begin to rise from the prairie. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home of a museum of Blackfoot culture. 

Joe Crowshoe Sr. (1903–1999) – &quot;Aapohsoy’yiis&quot; (Weasel Tail) – a ceremonial Elder of the Piikani Nation in southern Alberta, was instrumental in the development of the site. The Joe Crow Shoe Sr. Lodge is dedicated to his memory. He dedicated his life to preserving Aboriginal culture and promoting the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and in 1998 was awarded the National Aboriginal Achievement Award for &quot;saving the knowledge and practices of the Blackfoot people.&quot;

==History==
The buffalo jump was used for 5,500 years by the indigenous peoples of the plains to kill bison by driving them off the high cliff. Before the late introduction of horses, the Blackfoot drove the bison from a grazing area in the Porcupine Hills about west of the site to the &quot;drive lanes&quot;, lined by hundreds of cairns, by dressing up as coyotes and wolves. These specialized &quot;buffalo runners&quot; were young men trained in animal behavior to guide the bison into the drive lanes. Then, at full gallop, the bison would fall from the weight of the herd pressing behind them, breaking their legs and rendering them immobile. The cliff itself is about long, and at its highest point drops into the valley below. The site was in use at least 6,000 years ago, and the bone deposits are deep. After falling off the cliff, the injured bison were finished off by other Blackfoot warriors at the cliff base armed with spears and clubs. The carcasses were then processed at a nearby camp. The camp at the foot of the cliffs provided the people with everything they needed to process a bison carcass, including fresh water. The bison carcass was used for a variety of purposes, from tools made from the bone, to the hide used to make dwellings and clothing. The importance of the site goes beyond just providing food and supplies. After a successful hunt, the wealth of food allowed the people to enjoy leisure time and pursue artistic and spiritual interests. This increased the cultural complexity of the society.

In Blackfoot, the name for the site is &quot;Estipah-skikikini-kots&quot;. According to legend, a young Blackfoot wanted to watch the bison plunge off the cliff from below, but was buried underneath the falling animals. He was later found dead under the pile of carcasses, where he had his head smashed in.

===World Heritage Site===

Head-Smashed-In was abandoned in the 19th century after European contact. The site was first recorded by Europeans in the 1880s, and first excavated by the American Museum of Natural History in 1938. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1968, a Provincial Historic Site in 1979, and finally a World Heritage Site in 1981 for its testimony of prehistoric life and the customs of aboriginal people.

==Interpretive centre and museum==

Opened in 1987, the interpretive centre at Head-Smashed-In is built into the ancient sandstone cliff in naturalistic fashion. It contains five distinct levels depicting the ecology, mythology, lifestyle and technology of Blackfoot peoples within the context of available archaeological evidence, presented from the viewpoints of both aboriginal peoples and European archaeological science.

The centre also offers educational public and school programs which can be booked throughout the year. Each year Head-Smashed-In hosts a number of special events and native festivals known throughout the world for their color, energy and authenticity, including Buffalo Harvest Days, which brings together First Nations artists and craftspeople who display a wide variety of jewelry, clothing, art and crafts. Visitors can witness traditional drumming and dancing demonstrations every Wednesday in July and August at 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. at the centre.

An exhibition of photography titled &quot;Lost Identities: A Journey of Rediscovery&quot;, a collection of photographs taken in aboriginal communities, made its first appearance at the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump interpretive centre in 1999. After some time as a traveling exhibit, it was returned permanently to display in the centre. The permanent exhibition is a collaboration of many historical societies and museums to provide interpretations of the collection. The subjects of the photographs had gone unidentified for some time. While it was a traveling exhibit, the aboriginal communities where the photographs were taken provided further background and &quot;voice&quot; to the photographs.

The facility was designed by Le Blond Partnership, an architectural firm in Calgary. The design was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s gold medal for Architecture in 1990.

<doc id="246940" wikidata="Q156551" url="?curid=246940" title="Malvaceae">
<text>Malvaceae (), or the mallows, is a family of flowering plants estimated to contain 244 genera with 4225 known species. Well-known members of economic importance include okra, cotton, cacao, roselle and durian. There are also some genera containing familiar ornamentals, such as &quot;Alcea&quot; (hollyhock), &quot;Malva&quot; (mallow), and &quot;Tilia&quot; (lime or linden tree). The genera with the largest numbers of species include &quot;Hibiscus&quot; (434 species), &quot;Pavonia&quot; (291 species), &quot;Sida&quot; (275 species), &quot;Ayenia&quot; (216 species), &quot;Dombeya&quot; (197 species), and &quot;Sterculia&quot; (181 species).

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
The circumscription of the Malvaceae is controversial. The traditional Malvaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; comprise a very homogeneous and cladistically monophyletic group. Another major circumscription, Malvaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, has been more recently defined on the basis that genetics studies have shown the commonly recognised families Bombacaceae, Tiliaceae, and Sterculiaceae, which have always been considered closely allied to Malvaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;, are not monophyletic groups. The Malvaceae can be expanded to include all of these families so as to compose a monophyletic group. Adopting this circumscription, the Malvaceae incorporate a much larger number of genera.

===Subfamilies===
This article is based on the second circumscription, as presented by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. The Malvaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; (hereafter simply &quot;Malvaceae&quot;) comprise nine subfamilies. A tentative cladogram of the family is shown below. The diamond denotes a poorly supported branching (&lt;80%).

Until recently, relationships between these subfamilies were either poorly supported or almost completely obscure. Continuing disagreements focused primarily on the correct circumscription of these subfamilies, including the preservation of the family Bombacaceae. A study published in 2021 presented a fully resolved phylogenetic framework for Malvaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; using genomic data for all nine subfamilies.

Regarding the traditional Malvaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;, the subfamily Malvoideae approximately corresponds to that group.

===Genera===
245 genera are currently accepted.

=== Synapomorphies ===
The relationships between the &quot;core Malvales&quot; families used to be defined on the basis of shared &quot;malvean affinities&quot;. These included the presence of malvoid teeth, stems with mucilage canals, and stratified wedge-shaped phloem. These affinities were problematic because they were not always shared within the core families. Later studies revealed more unambiguous synapomorphies within Malvaceae &quot;s.l..&quot; Synapomorphies identified within Malvaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; include the presence of tile cells, trichomatous nectaries, and an inflorescence structure called a bicolor unit. Tile cells consist of vertically positioned cells interspersed between and dimensionally similar to procumbent ray cells. Evidence of Malvean wood fossils has confirmed their evolutionary link in Malvaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;, as well as explained their diverse structures. Flowers of Malvaceae &quot;s.l&quot;. exhibit nectaries consisting of densely arranged multicellular hairs resembling trichomes. In most of Malvaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;, these trichomatous nectaries are located on the inner surface of the sepals, but flowers of the subfamily Tiliodeae also have present nectaries on the petals. Malvean flowers also share a unifying structure known as a bicolor unit, named for its initial discovery in the flowers of &quot;Theobroma bicolor&quot;. The bicolor unit consists of an ordered inflorescence with determinate cymose structures. The inflorescence can branch off the main axis, creating separate orders of the flowers, with the main axis developing first. Bracts on the peduncle subtend axillary buds that become these lateral stalks. One bract within this whorl is a sterile bract. The bicolor unit is a variable structure in complexity, but the presence of fertile and sterile bracts is a salient characteristic.

===Names===
The English common name &#x27;mallow&#x27; (also applied to other members of Malvaceae) comes from Latin &quot;&quot; (also the source for the English word &quot;&quot;). &quot;Malva&quot; itself was ultimately derived from the word for the plant in ancient Mediterranean languages. Cognates of the word include Ancient Greek () or (), Modern Greek (), modern () and modern ().

==Description==
Most species are herbaceous plants or shrubs, but some are trees or lianas.

===Leaves and stems===
Leaves are generally alternate, often palmately lobed or compound and palmately veined. The margin may be entire, but when dentate, a vein ends at the tip of each tooth (malvoid teeth). Stipules are present. The stems contain mucous canals and often also mucous cavities. Hairs are common, and are most typically . Stems of Bombacoideae are often covered in thick prickles.

===Flowers===

The flowers are commonly borne in definite or indefinite axillary inflorescences, which are often reduced to a single flower, but may also be cauliflorous, oppositifolious, or terminal. They often bear supernumerary bracts in the structure of a bicolor unit. They can be unisexual or bisexual, and are generally actinomorphic, often associated with conspicuous bracts, forming an epicalyx. They generally have five valvate sepals, most frequently basally connate, with five imbricate petals. The stamens are five to numerous, and connate at least at their bases, but often forming a tube around the pistils. The pistils are composed of two to many connate carpels. The ovary is superior, with axial placentation, with capitate or lobed stigma. 
The flowers have nectaries made of many tightly packed glandular hairs, usually positioned on the sepals.

===Fruits===

The fruits are most often loculicidal capsules, schizocarps or nuts.

===Pollination===
Self-pollination is often avoided by means of protandry. Most species are entomophilous (pollinated by insects). Bees from the tribe Emphorini of the Apidae (including &quot;Ptilothrix&quot;, &quot;Diadasia&quot;, and &quot;Melitoma&quot;) are known to specialize on the plants.

==Importance==
A number of species are pests in agriculture, including &quot;Abutilon theophrasti&quot; and &quot;Modiola caroliniana&quot;, and others that are garden escapees. Cotton (four species of &quot;Gossypium&quot;), kenaf (&quot;Hibiscus cannabinus&quot;), cacao (&quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;), kola nut (&quot;Cola spp.&quot;), and okra (&quot;Abelmoschus esculentus&quot;) are important agricultural crops. The fruit and leaves of baobabs are edible, as is the fruit of the durian. A number of species, including &quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot; and &quot;Alcea rosea&quot; are garden plants.

<doc id="246944" wikidata="Q946443" url="?curid=246944" title="Festa de l'Unità">
<text> is an annual social-democratic festival in Italy, originally organised by the Italian Communist Party (PCI) to finance and spread its official newspaper (&quot;Unity&quot;), and now organised by the Democratic Party. It is often misspelled (&quot;Unity party&quot;), since people forget where the name comes from.

The event is generally organized as many separated happenings, usually one for each city, but where the PCI was more present, every local branch organized its own happening and often all of them collaborated to the organization of a large one as well. Typical aspects are political conferences, low-price or free typical foods, live music, prize games and street markets. Small events start already in July, but the main happenings take place in September.

While the political aspect was preponderant in its first times, and is at times still important, it has developed with time into a social event for the youth (music events and discos) and elderly people (talking about the political adventures of their past and dancing swing).

In some parts of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, each and every small village seems to have its own &quot;festa de &quot;, which is often the biggest social event of the year. In Bologna and in Florence, they have developed into a two-week-long, tens-of-thousands-people-packed event that has little resemblance to the original political gathering, and are instead two of the biggest attractions for young people in the vicinity.

Following the birth in 2007 of the Democratic Party the name of the was changed, at a national level, to the &quot;Festa Democratica&quot;. At the provincial level, however, and for important local party organisations, the traditional name was retained, while elsewhere new hybrid appellations have been adopted such &quot;Festa del Partito Democratico&quot; or &quot;Festa di [place name]&quot;. The traditional name was restored in 2014, after the election of Matteo Renzi as new national Secretary of the party.

<doc id="246947" wikidata="Q6006204" url="?curid=246947" title="Impeccability">
<text>Impeccability is the absence of sin. Christianity teaches this to be an attribute of God (logically God cannot sin: it would mean that he would act against his own will and nature) and therefore it is also attributed to Christ.

== Roman Catholic teachings ==
=== The Virgin Mary ===
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that Mary, mother of Jesus was—by a special grace of God—without sin her entire life. This included the moment of her conception, so Mary was even miraculously preserved from original sin and its effects. Some theologians have asserted this special grace extended to impeccability (understood in this context as the inability to sin); others argue this could not be so: as a natural human being, she would have had free will and therefore the &quot;ability&quot; to sin but through her cooperation avoided it. 

Protestant Christian theology holds that Jesus died for the sins of even his mother. 

=== Papacy ===
Impeccability is sometimes confused with infallibility, especially in discussions of papal infallibility. Impeccability is an attribute &quot;not&quot; claimed by the pope, and few would deny that there have been bad popes—Saint Peter himself denied Jesus three times. On the other hand, Pope Gregory VII, intellectual progenitor of the Ultramontanes and nemesis of the lay faction in the investiture controversy, voiced an assertion of papal prerogative beyond even the strongest of modern apologists:
The pope can be judged by no one; the Roman church has never erred and never will err till the end of time; the Roman church was founded by Christ alone; the pope alone can depose and restore bishops; he alone can make new laws, set up new bishoprics and divide old ones. ...He alone can call general councils and authorize canon laws; his legates ... have precedence over all bishops. ...A duly ordained pope is undoubtedly made a saint by the merits of St. Peter.

Nevertheless, in Catholic thought, the exemption of the See of Rome from all error extends only to its definitive teachings on faith and morals, not to its historical judgments. Similarly, papal sainthood does not suggest that popes are free from sin. Quite the contrary, popes frequent the sacrament of Reconciliation (confession and penance) for the forgiveness of their sins, as all Catholics are required to do. While occupying the papal office, Pope Benedict XVI confessed his sins weekly.

=== Afterlife ===
Early Christians questioned whether the victorious saints in heaven could sin. Church Father and theologian Origen of Alexandria maintained that they could; official Roman Catholic doctrine holds that they cannot. Although Catholics believe in the gift of free will, saints in heaven already see God face to face and are incapable of sinning (see Pope Benedict XII and beatific vision), i.e., they will necessarily remain in God. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states (emphasis added):

Thomas Aquinas taught that souls in Purgatory cannot sin (&quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Second Part of the Second Part, Question 83, Article 11, Reply to Objection 3), let alone the saints in heaven. This is the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, although there are different opinions on the reasons for the impossibility to sin.

==Protestant teaching==
Evangelical writer Donald Macleod suggests that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements. &quot;First, Christ was free of actual sin.&quot; Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin, nor confessing sin. The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin, nor could he be proven guilty of sin; he had no vices. In fact, he is quoted as asking, &quot;Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?&quot; in John 8:46. Secondly, he was free from inherent sin (&quot;original sin&quot; or &quot;ancestral sin&quot;).
==Pelagianism==
According to Pelagianism, sin arises from free choice rather than being an inevitable consequence of man&#x27;s fallen nature. Therefore, it is theoretically possible, although unusual, for anyone to live a sinless life.

<doc id="246949" wikidata="Q1320549" url="?curid=246949" title="Skysurfing">
<text>Sky surfing is a type of skydiving and extreme sport in which the skydiver wears a custom skysurf board attached to the feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.

The boards used are generally smaller than actual surfboards, and look more like snowboards or large skateboards. Custom bindings attach the board to the feet, which is removable with the use of a 2-ring release system based on the common 3-ring release system used to cut away main parachutes.

A neutral position maintaining stability is to stand upright on the board during freefall, this is also the position required for deployment of the main parachute whilst surfing medium and expert boards.

The combination of rigid board and relative wind requires control to maintain stability during freefall. The jumper must control the board and their body position so as to open the parachute in a stable configuration. More advanced aerobatics such as loops, rolls and helicopter spins are possible. Since some moves involve high G-force spins, some skysurfers tightly wrap bandages all the way up their arms to keep the blood from pooling at the end of the limbs. However, even with this bandage technique, many techniques in skysurfing can be extremely painful and result in temporary paralysis of fingers along with subconjunctival bleeding (broken blood vessel in the eye).

When a skysurfer is filmed by another skydiver falling alongside them, the resulting film gives the appearance that the skysurfer is riding on the air in the same way a surfer rides on a wave. The downward motion is not very apparent and this creates the illusion that a skysurfer is floating on the relative wind. A skysurfer falls at speeds comparable to any other freefall or freeflying skydiver, with speed varying depending on orientation. The competitive discipline of skysurfing is a team sport consisting of a skysurfer and a camera flyer with a video camera.

== History ==
Pioneers, included the late Patrick de Gayardon, Eric Fradet &amp; Phillipe Vallaud. Mike Frost, Sean MacCormick and Kebe remain prominent in the sport, each with between 25 - 30 years experience, providing industry seminars and coaching programmes, ensuring the next generation of skysurfers can access the discipline and progress safely along with commercial exposure through the sport. 

In 1991, after performing standing on a surfboard for a skysurfing advertisement of Coca-Cola, Ray Palmer became the first Australian skysurfer.

The sport of skysurfing coincided with other new-age disciplines in skydiving freestyle freeflying. It reached its peak in popularity during the mid to late 1990s. Skysurfers were featured in prime time television commercials for major brands like Pepsi, AT&amp;T &amp; Sony PlayStation and continue to this day with Red Bull. The combination of brand association, television coverage and competition promoted the sport of skydiving in a positive manner while producing exciting content for brands to be associated with. A number of movie studios included skysurfing in action sequences such as Silver Surfer &amp; XXX (2002) film. Ralph Lauren created a fragrance brand Extreme Polo Sport based on imagery of skysurfing.

Competitive team skysurfing was prominent during the late 1990s with most notable being ESPN X Games (1995 to 2000) &amp; FAI World Air Games 1997.

The hazards associated with skysurfing are mainly due to loss of control inducing flat spins where the head is outside of the center of the spinning body. Proper guidance &amp; practice will avoid unnecessary risks involved. Safely releasing the board is something that needs to be discussed with an experienced skysurfer. The amount of time required to master the expert board is approximately 1000 jumps.

Skysurf boards are typically custom made by the sky surfer with cooperation from qualified parachute riggers to manufacture the bindings and cut-away systems. Commercial board manufacturers during the 1990&#x27;s included Tom Stanton and Jerry Loftis; both offering boards in different sizes for beginner, intermediate and expert abilities. SurfFlite has changed ownership a number of times and continues to manufacture boards.

The skill, experience and time required to master skysurfing led to a decline in the popularity in the skydiving community however this is experiencing a resurgence attributed to coaching, the introduction of Vertical Wind Tunnel and as skydivers seek new challenges.

A presentation of the History and Future of Skysurfing was made at the British Parachute Association.

== Competitions ==
Skysurfing Competitions have ranged from FAI World Air Games, SSI pro tour, ESPN X games, national sky surf championships in USA, UK &amp; Switzerland, also Boards Over Europe and Sky surfing World Cup and Skysurfing World Championships.

A sky surfing team include two people; sky surfer and a camera flier. Judges give scores to a sky surfing team not only for the variety of moves and the total performance but also for the skills of camera flier to catch the best moments of performance. 50% of the total score is calculated on sky surfer&#x27;s performance, and 50% on the cameraman&#x27;s score.

The first Skysurf World Championship was held in Efes, Turkey on 13–21 September 1997 by the International Parachuting Committee.

Competitive team skysurfing was featured as part of the ESPN X Games from 1995 to 2000. In 1996 and 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight X-Trials qualifying events in both North America and Europe. During this six-year period, pro skysurf teams received a total of $392,000 in cash winnings and the discipline garnered over 100 hours of global TV exposure without incident. In 2000 ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports chose Skysurfing from the X-Games to cover due to its attractive television format.

== Training ==
Training programmes were established to ensure the safe progression of the sport. With the growth in participants and interest to progress safely the British Parachute Association rules were adopted as part of the Operations Manual and guidelines for achieving SS1 &amp; SS2 recognition of their skills. Loftis developed an instructional programme with skysurf schools run by a number of competitive sky surfers. A number of coaching programmes remain, with expert advice and coaching considered mandatory by drop zone owners and chief instructors to mitigate risk.

== Records and firsts ==
As with a new any new sport a number of firsts and records were established, featured in the media and a number recognised by Record Breakers and Guinness World Records. These included the highest altitude exit, surfing in a thunder storm, extreme ironing, most number of spins, surfing above active volcanos and longest distance travelled on a &#x27;sky-glider&#x27;.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell is a 2002 stealth game developed by Ubi Soft Montreal and published by Ubi Soft. It is the first game in the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series. Endorsed by author Tom Clancy, it follows the activities of NSA black ops agent Sam Fisher (voiced by Michael Ironside). The game was inspired by both the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series and games created by Looking Glass Studios, and was built using Unreal Engine 2.

Originally released as an Xbox exclusive in 2002, the game was ported to Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Mac OS X in 2003. A side-scrolling adaptation developed by Gameloft was also released in 2003 for Game Boy Advance, mobile phones and N-Gage (the latter with the subtitle &quot;Team Stealth Action&quot;). A remastered high definition version was released on PlayStation 3 in September 2011, and an Xbox version was made available for Xbox One via backward compatibility in June 2019.

&quot;Splinter Cell&quot; received critical acclaim on release and is considered as one of the best video games ever made. The success of the game lead to multiple sequels, starting with &quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot; in 2004, and a series of novels written under the pseudonym David Michaels. A remake of the game is currently in development by Ubisoft Toronto.

== Gameplay ==
The primary focus and hallmark of &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;″s gameplay is stealth, with strong emphasis on light and darkness. The player is encouraged to move through the shadows for concealment whenever possible. The game displays a &quot;light meter&quot; that reflects how visible the player character is to enemies, and night vision and thermal vision goggles to help the player navigate in darkness or smoke/fog, respectively. The light meter functions even when it is difficult to gauge how much light is in the environment (for example, if night vision or infrared vision goggles are being used), and it is possible to destroy lights, thus reducing the chances of exposure significantly. Certain cameras can also be shot out and disabled, although armoured security cameras are bulletproof.

&quot;Splinter Cell&quot; strongly encourages the use of stealth over brute force. Although Sam Fisher is usually equipped with firearms, he carries limited ammunition and is not frequently provided with access to additional ammo. The player begins most missions with a limited supply of less-than-lethal weapons in addition to Fisher&#x27;s firearms, a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol that is provided for every mission, as well as a similarly silenced FN F2000 assault rifle which is only available for a &quot;number&quot; of missions, which includes a telescopic sight and a launcher for some of the less-lethal devices such as ring airfoil projectiles, &quot;sticky shockers&quot; and CS gas grenades. The weapon can even fire a camera that sticks onto surfaces, allowing Fisher to covertly perform surveillance from a safe area.

Flexibility of movement is a focuspoint of &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;. Fisher can sneak up on enemies from behind to grab them; allowing interrogation, quiet incapacitation, or use as a human shield. Fisher is acrobatic and physically adept, and has a variety of maneuvers including the ability to mantle onto and climb along ledges, hang from pipes and perform a &quot;split jump&quot; in narrow spaces to mantle up a steep wall.

== Plot ==
In August 2004, former U.S. Navy SEAL officer Sam Fisher joins the National Security Agency, as part of its newly formed division &quot;Third Echelon&quot;, headed by his old friend Irving Lambert. Two months later, Fisher, aided by technical expert Anna &quot;Grim&quot; Grimsdóttír and field runner Vernon Wilkes Jr., is sent to Georgia to investigate the disappearance of two CIA officers. One had been installed into the new government of Georgian president Kombayn Nikoladze, who seized power in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état following the assassination of his predecessor; the other was sent in to find the first after their disappearance. Fisher discovers both were murdered on Nikoladze&#x27;s orders by former Spetsnaz member Vyacheslav Grinko, after discovering that Georgia is secretly waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across Azerbaijan with Georgian commandos. After this is exposed to the international community, NATO launches action in Azerbaijan, prompting Nikoladze to go underground.

Third Echelon soon discovers a data exchange is taking place between a Caspian oil rig and the Georgian presidential palace. Fisher intercepts this, discovering information about an item called &quot;The Ark&quot;, as well as evidence that there is a mole in the CIA. Shortly after this, North America is hit by a massive cyber warfare attack directed at military targets, to which Nikoladze claims responsibility before declaring war on the United States and its allies. Investigating the leak, Fisher infiltrates the CIA headquarters and discovers a staff member backed-up data to an unsecured laptop. He captures the treacherous employee, who explains that the laptop was later exploited by a Virginian-based network owned by Kalinatek, Inc, a tech company controlled by the Georgians. After Grim&#x27;s efforts to access their servers spooks them, Fisher is sent in to recover an encryption key from a technician in the building, before Georgian-hired mafiosos attempt to liquidate all the incriminating evidence. While extracting Fisher, Wilkes is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards.

With the encryption key, the NSA discover that Nikoladze has been using a network of unconventional relays to communicate with Georgian military cells. Tracing the full relay network back to the Chinese embassy in Yangon, Myanmar, Fisher is sent in discreetly to investigate. Fisher discovers Nikoladze is working alongside Chinese general Kong Feirong, supplying him with nuclear waste in exchange for arms and munitions. Fearful this could lead China and the United States into war, Fisher moves to rescue captured U.S. soldiers at an abattoir before they can be executed live in a web broadcast, in the process encountering high-ranking Chinese diplomats, who reveal Feirong acts against the best interests of China. Grinko, who is at the abattoir, attempts to kill Fisher, but meets his demise in Fisher&#x27;s attempt to protect the hostages. Fisher moves in to capture Feirong for information on Nikoladze&#x27;s location and to expose his rogue activities to the Chinese government. After being prevented from committing suicide in a drunken stupor, Feirong is threatened at gunpoint to access his computer, with its data revealing that Nikoladze had fled back to Georgia in order to activate &quot;The Ark&quot;. Feirong subsequently dies from the consumed alcohol.

Infiltrating the Georgian presidential palace where Nikoladze is, alongside the newly-installed Georgian president Varlam Cristavi, Fisher attempts to recover the key to the Ark, which he learns is in fact a nuclear suitcase bomb that has been placed somewhere in the United States. Fisher corners Nikoladze, who bargains to give the Ark key in exchange for safe passage out of Georgia. After Cristavi&#x27;s forces arrive and escort Nikoladze to safety, Lambert rescues Fisher from execution by creating a diversion via power blackout. Discovering that Nikoladze is offering the Ark&#x27;s location for protection, Fisher assassinates him on Lambert&#x27;s orders. The National Guard eventually locates the bomb in an apartment complex in the state of Maryland, and secretly recovers it after evacuating the building under the pretense of dealing with a gas leak. Despite a war being averted, Nikoladze&#x27;s death sparks international backlash due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding it. While watching the U.S. president giving a speech on the end of the crisis, Fisher receives a secure phone call from Lambert for another assignment.

== Development ==
The game originally started development as a sci-fi, James Bond type game called &quot;The Drift&quot;, which Ubisoft intended to be &quot;a &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; killer&quot;. The game&#x27;s producer Mathieu Ferland said &quot;&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was a huge inspiration for &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;.&quot; The game&#x27;s designer and writer Clint Hocking also said &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; &quot;owes its existence to&quot; the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, while noting he was also influenced by &quot;System Shock&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Deus Ex&quot;.

Because the development team was aiming for a Teen ESRB rating, the team tried to minimize the level of violence. The soundtrack for the game was composed by English composer Michael Richard Plowman.

=== Version differences ===
The PC version of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; is fairly closely based on the original Xbox version. Both were made by Ubisoft Montreal. The GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions, released later, were developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and are similar to each other, but have many small changes over the originals with the result that they are generally easier. Some doors are moved around, guards are less likely to notice gunshots, etc.

Each version of the game has some exclusive features. The Xbox and Windows versions have three new downloadable missions which involve a Russian nuclear sub. The PlayStation 2 version includes an exclusive level between Kalinatek and the Chinese Embassy which takes place in a nuclear power plant in the Kola Peninsula, new cinematics, a new intro cinematic with original music by the Prague Orchestra and many behind-the-scenes interviews and documentaries both about the new intro and the game itself. The GameCube version includes the same cinematics, uses the Game Boy Advance link cable to give players a real-time overhead map, a new sticky-bomb weapon and progressive scan (480p) support. Additionally, both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions include new binoculars items. The Windows versions also includes support for the EAX 3.0 ADVANCED HD 3D positional audio technology by Creative Labs, which available in the EMU10K2 processor-based Soundcard such as the Sound Blaster Audigy and Audigy 2 series.

A PlayStation 3 version was announced to be part of the &quot;Splinter Cell Trilogy&quot; which was released in September 2011 as part of Sony&#x27;s Classics HD series. It was revealed on the PlayStation Blog that it would be ported from the PC version, because it had more details and more content than the PlayStation 2 version. It was released on the European PlayStation Network on August 10, 2011. The PlayStation 3 version does not include the downloadable bonus missions that the Xbox and PC versions had.

== Reception ==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; received positive reviews upon the game&#x27;s release. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin said that &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; has &quot;hands down the best lighting effects seen in any game to date.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; later named &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; the second-best Xbox game of November 2002, behind &quot;MechAssault&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; likewise praised the game for its graphics and lighting, while also praising how it evolved &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s third-person stealth-action gameplay. Both praised the game&#x27;s audio, noting that Michael Ironside as Sam Fisher&#x27;s voice suited the role perfectly. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame gave the Xbox version four-and-a-half stars out of five and called it &quot;one of the few games to elicit a feeling of suspense without resorting to shock techniques found in survival horror titles like &quot;Resident Evil&quot;.&quot;

Criticism of the game was also present. Greg Kasavin said that &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; is &quot;sometimes reduced to frustrating bouts of trial and error.&quot; In addition, Kasavin criticized the game&#x27;s cutscenes, saying that they are not up to par with the rest of the game&#x27;s graphics.

Non video-game publications also gave the game favorable reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the Xbox version an A and called it &quot;wickedly ingenious&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the PlayStation 2 version eight out of ten and said, &quot;If this game were any more realistic, you&#x27;d have to hold in your farts.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the Game Boy Advance version all four stars and said that &quot;While it lacks 3-D graphics and an impressive use of lighting and shadows found in its predecessors, the stealthy action game still captures the thrill of modern espionage.&quot;

=== Sales ===
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; was a commercial success. Pre-orders reached 1.1 million units and the game sold 480,000 copies worldwide by the end of 2002, after three weeks on sale. France accounted for 60,000 units in the initial three weeks. By early January 2003, sales in North America had surpassed 1 million units, while Europe accounted for 600,000 units. By March 31, 2003, its sales had risen to 3.6 million copies. &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; sold 4.5 million copies by June and 5 million by the end of September, and its sales reached 6 million units by the end of March 2004. By July 2006, the Xbox version of &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; had sold 2.4 million copies and earned $62 million in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 10th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. It remained the best-selling &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; game in the United States by July 2006.

The game&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions each received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), given to titles that sell at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;″s computer version received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from ELSPA, indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell is a series of stealth action-adventure video games, the first of which was released in 2002, and their tie-in novels that were endorsed by Tom Clancy. The series follows Sam Fisher, a highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops sub-division within the NSA, dubbed &quot;Third Echelon&quot;, as he overcomes his adversaries. Levels are created using Unreal Engine and emphasize light and darkness as gameplay elements. The series has been positively received, and was once considered to be one of Ubisoft&#x27;s flagship franchises. The series had sold 19 million units by 2008. No further installments have been released since 2013. A remake of the first game was announced in December 2021.

==Games==

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; (2002)===

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; was developed over a period of two years and developed by Ubisoft Montreal with original publishing by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox as an exclusive title. Later in 2003, Ubisoft ported the game to Microsoft Windows, Mac, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Inspired by the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, it uses an Unreal Engine 2 that was modified to allow light-and-dark based gameplay.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow&quot; (2004)===

&quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot; was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and Ubisoft Milan and introduced multiplayer gameplay to the series. In single-player mode, the game AI adapts to adjust to the player&#x27;s skill level. Unlike other games in the series, which generally lean towards information-based threats, the plot of &quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot; focuses on biological warfare, in which an Indonesian terrorist group threatens to infect people with the smallpox virus. Fisher is also given new abilities like SWAT turns and whistling to attract enemies&#x27; attention. It also introduced a revolutionary new online mode called spies versus mercenaries, in which one team would play from a 3rd person perspective on the spy team, and the more guns-blazing first-person perspective of the mercenaries.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot; (2005)===

Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Milan were again responsible for the third game in the series, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;. It adds a cooperative multiplayer mode. Originally announced to be released in Fall 2004, its initial releases were made at the end of March 2005. The Unreal Engine was heavily modified, this time from version 2.5. The game includes a number of new features, including adding a combat knife to the player&#x27;s inventory. Maps are also more open with multiple ways of achieving the end goal.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Essentials&quot; (2006)===

&quot;Essentials&quot; extends the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series to the PSP platform. Through a series of flashback missions, the player learns more about Fisher&#x27;s backstory. The game was less positively received critically than previous installments, with criticism aimed at the control mechanics and the multiplayer mode.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Double Agent&quot; (2006)===

For the series&#x27; fourth installment, &quot;Double Agent&quot;, two separate versions were created, one for generation six consoles and the Wii, and the other for Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 3. &quot;Double Agent&quot; features a &quot;trust system&quot; that presents the player with moral dilemmas. It is the first game in the series with a hub-like area, where Sam can explore and do objectives between missions. This is also the only game in the series to have different endings based on player decisions, but only one ending is considered canon.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Conviction&quot; (2010)===

&quot;Conviction&quot; was officially announced on May 23, 2007, when Ubisoft released a trailer for the game. The game was due for release on November 16, 2007. However, the game missed its initial launch date, and on May 19, 2008, it was reported that &quot;Conviction&quot; was &quot;officially on hold&quot; and that the game had been taken &quot;back to the drawing board&quot;. Ubisoft announced that the game had been pushed back to the 2009–10 fiscal year. At E3 2009, the developers confirmed that the &quot;new&quot; &quot;Conviction&quot; had been in development since early 2008, commenting that &quot;the gameplay has evolved a lot&quot; and &quot;the visual direction is simply much better&quot;. The game&#x27;s release date was pushed back several times. On March 18, 2010, the demo was released for Xbox 360. Ubisoft wanted to make the fifth game more accessible, so &quot;Conviction&quot; was designed around the new core elements &quot;Mark and Execute&quot; and &quot;Last Known Position&quot;, while stealth elements present in the previous games were omitted, such as the ability to whistle, lock pick, and hide bodies. &quot;Conviction&quot; uses a cover system and adds simple interrogation sequences to the series.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Classic Trilogy HD&quot; (2011)===
In September 2011, a remastered compilation package was released for the PlayStation 3 that included the first three games in the series. The remastered versions are based on the PC ports of the originals. The compilation received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews on Metacritic.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Blacklist&quot; (2013)===

&quot;Blacklist&quot; is the sixth installment in the series, developed by Ubisoft Toronto and was released on August 20, 2013. &quot;Blacklist&quot; boasts new features combining gameplay from &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; and &quot;Conviction&quot;. Series veteran Michael Ironside was replaced in his role as Sam Fisher by actor Eric Johnson. In the game, Fisher has been appointed as the commander of the new &quot;Fourth Echelon&quot;, a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. She has denied any existence of the agency and Fourth Echelon is working to stop a new terror plot, known as the &#x27;Blacklist&#x27;. Fourth Echelon also has the secondary objective of stopping all operations in which Third Echelon is still running. Features returning include a moving &quot;Mark and Execute&quot;, Fisher&#x27;s signature goggles and a new knife, the Karambit, and the ability to perform &quot;abduction&quot; stealth melee takedowns.

===Future===
At E3 2017 regarding &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated: &quot;I can&#x27;t say much about that. But, for sure, all the Clancy games are taken care of. It&#x27;s just we have quite a lot on our plate at the moment...[A]ll the Clancy games are really coming along, so we are not forgetting &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;.&quot; Later in an Ask Me Anything Reddit post, he stated: &quot;We don&#x27;t have anything specific to share at the moment but teams are working on different things, so stay tuned for more.&quot;

In May 2019, Julian Gerighty, Ubisoft Creative Director, announced on his social media page that a game is currently in development. In his statement, he said he had been working on the game with Ubisoft Montreal creative director, Roman Campos-Oriola, and executive producer Dan Hay. However, Ubisoft later disputed this.

On 16 September 2020, it was announced at Facebook Connect that a virtual reality version of the series is coming exclusively to the Oculus VR platform, along with an &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; game. They are set to be developed by Red Storm Entertainment. On July 21, 2022, the VR &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; game was cancelled.

In December 2021, Ubisoft revealed that they are developing a remake of the first game. In October 2022, David Grivel, the director of the game, left Ubisoft.

==Novels==
===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; (2004)===
&quot;Splinter Cell&quot; is the first installment of a series of novels based on the video game series. It was written by Raymond Benson under the pseudonym David Michaels. The plot follows Sam Fisher as he investigates a terrorist group called &quot;The Shadows&quot; and a related arms-dealing organization named &quot;The Shop&quot;. Members of &quot;The Shop&quot; use inside information to attempt to kill &quot;Third Echelon&quot; members, including Fisher. Shortly after its publication in December 2004, it spent 3 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of bestsellers. It also made it to the list of Wall Street Journal mass-market paperback bestsellers.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda&quot; (2005)===
In &quot;Operation Barracuda&quot;, which was released on November 1, 2005, Raymond Benson (again as David Michaels) continues the story of the first &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; novel. The book was also featured on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Checkmate&quot; (2006)===
For &quot;Checkmate&quot;, Grant Blackwood took over as author behind the David Michaels pseudonym, Benson having declared that he was &quot;finished with Splinter Cell&quot;. Unlike the first two books, &quot;Checkmate&quot; is not written from the first person perspective of Fisher, nor does &quot;Checkmate&quot; continue the running subplots that were established in the previous book. This novel was released on November 7, 2006.

The book begins with a ship by the name of &quot;Trego&quot; sailing towards the American East Coast. Sam Fisher is called in from a training mission to disable the ship. After Fisher stops the ship from irradiating the American West Coast with nuclear waste, he is informed that a town by the name of Slipstone has been attacked with a radiological weapon and over 5,000 people are dead. These events lead Fisher to Ukraine, Iran, Dubai, and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Fallout&quot; (2007)===
On November 6, 2007, &quot;Fallout&quot;, was published, Blackwood&#x27;s second &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; novel and the fourth in the series. Like the previous novel, it was written by Grant Blackwood, under the pseudonym David Michaels. The story follows Sam Fisher as he combats Islamic fundamentalists who have taken over the government of Kyrgyzstan.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Conviction&quot; (2009)===
&quot;Conviction&quot; is the tie-in novel to the game with the same name. It was published on November 3, 2009, and was written by Peter Telep under the name David Michaels. It was published by Berkley Books, under Penguin Group. The book follows Sam Fisher after the killing of Lambert. Fisher is on the run and has &quot;gone rogue,&quot; as he is believed to be a treasonous agent. He is chased by a team of rookie Splinter Cells led by Ben Hansen.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Endgame&quot; (2009)===
&quot;Endgame&quot;, published on December 1, 2009, is the counterpart to the &quot;Conviction&quot; novel. The plot runs parallel to the &quot;Conviction&quot; novel, but from the point of view of Fisher&#x27;s antagonists. The story is told from the perspective of Ben Hansen and the rest of the team pursuing Fisher.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell Blacklist: Aftermath&quot; (2013)===
Published in October 2013, this tie-in novel takes place after the events of the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Blacklist&quot;. It involves Fisher and Fourth Echelon finding and rescuing a Russian billionaire who disobeyed orders from the Kremlin to release a computer virus against the United States. &quot;Aftermath&quot; is written by Peter Telep and the first in the series to be authored without the use of the David Michaels pseudonym.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Firewall&quot; (2022)===
&quot;Firewall&quot; was released on March 1 for Kindle and on March 15 for paperback. It was written by James Swallow and features Sam Fisher&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, working alongside her father. The plot involves Fisher dealing with a cyberwarfare technology known as &quot;Gordian Sword&quot; which is capable of defeating any firewall and will be auctioned to the highest bidder regardless of their motives for using it. Fisher must stop the technology being used or sold before it falls into the hands of terrorists, criminals, or rogue states.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Dragonfire&quot; (2023)===
&quot;Dragonfire&quot; was released on January 24 for Kindle and on the same day for paperback. It was written by James Swallow and it features Sam Fisher&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, working alongside her father and Isaac Briggs. The plot involves Fisher working behind enemy lines in North Korea while his daughter searches for him all the while trying to expose the sinister scheme of the conspirators known as The Dragons.

==Common elements==
===Plot and themes===
The first game explains that &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; refers to an elite recon-type unit of single covert operatives (such as Sam Fisher) who are supported in the field by a high-tech remote team.

In the first three games (&quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;), terrorists are planning attacks, usually by use of information warfare, which Fisher, an operative for Third Echelon, a secret branch of the NSA, must prevent. The missions range from gathering intelligence to capturing and/or eliminating terrorists.

In the fourth game, &quot;Double Agent&quot;, Fisher assumes the identity of a wanted criminal in order to infiltrate a terrorist ring.

The fifth game, &quot;Conviction&quot;, begins immediately after &quot;Double Agent&quot;. Having abandoned Third Echelon, Fisher discovers that the death of his daughter Sarah had not been an accident (as had been purported at the beginning of &quot;Double Agent&quot;), leading him to strike out on his own in search of those responsible, until his investigation uncovers a conspiracy within his old agency.

In the sixth and most recent game, &quot;Blacklist, &quot;Third Echelon has been disbanded by the President of the United States. A new outfit, Fourth Echelon, is formed by the President and placed under the command of Fisher with the mission of stopping the &#x27;Blacklist&#x27; attacks and the Engineers, the organization behind them. &quot;Blacklist&quot; deals with the morality of war and how far Fisher and his team go in order to prevent these plots against America.

===Characters===
The characters of the games, as well as the organization &quot;Third Echelon&quot;, were created by J. T. Petty. The main recurring ones are:
*Sam Fisher is the main protagonist of the series.
*Irving Lambert, leader of &quot;Third Echelon&quot;, serves as the player&#x27;s guide by leading Fisher through the games&#x27; missions, until he is killed by Sam in &quot;Double Agent&quot;.
*Anna &quot;Grim&quot; Grimsdóttír is portrayed as an official Third Echelon hacker and analyst, who helps Fisher when technical obstacles need to be overcome. In &quot;Conviction&quot; she takes over the role of guide from the deceased Lambert; her character also becomes the source of dramatic tension in the story. In &quot;Blacklist&quot;, she is the technical operations officer and butts heads with Sam over morality, ethics, and Fourth Echelon&#x27;s operating parameters.
*Sarah Fisher, Sam&#x27;s daughter and sole family member. She was presumed to be killed in &quot;Double Agent&quot;, but &quot;Conviction&quot; revealed her murder to be a deception.

===Gameplay===
The encouraged way to progress through the games is to remain hidden, select non-obvious routes, and utilize diversions to pass guards. The first game in the series only features a single-player mode, &quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot; introduces a two-on-two multiplayer mode. &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; further develops that mode and introduces a cooperative mode. Cooperative mode plays similarly to the single player mode, but adds situations that can only be overcome as a team. The cooperative storylines in &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; and the sixth generation version of &quot;Double Agent&quot; parallel those of Fisher&#x27;s actions in the single-player modes, letting players act on information he obtained or provide support in the field.

&quot;Double Agent&quot; introduces a morality factor: Fisher may now encounter conflicting objectives between his superiors and the terrorists. For example, the terrorists may assign a mission to assassinate someone, while the NSA simultaneously instructs the player to prevent the assassination. This creates a delicate balancing act between gaining the trust of the terrorists and fulfilling the mission assignments. In addition, Fisher must not do anything to reveal to the terrorists that he is a double agent (such as let himself be seen with an NSA gadget), otherwise he will lose instantly.

&quot;Conviction&quot; utilises a much faster and more violent form of stealth action gameplay than previous games in the series. It retains the cooperative multiplayer mode of the two preceding games.
The weapons that Sam Fisher uses are based more accurately on current real-world weapons which behave accordingly and all weapons can be upgraded by a points system. This points system is secondary to the main storyline and is achievement based. These points may be used to add silencers, sights, upgraded ammo, laser targeting and other upgrades, with up to three upgrades per weapon.
This game provides an interactive mission update sequence that is built into the levels themselves. Instead of getting an objective-bar popup, the objective may appear in bold white text on the side of a building or in front of a barricade. This adds to the immersion and keeps the HUD uncluttered. The stealth element of the game allows Fisher to hide in the shadows and become almost invisible. Guards may be assassinated by unsuppressed or silenced weapons, gadgets, or hand-to-hand combat. After successfully completing a hand-to-hand kill, the player is provided with an &#x27;execution&#x27; bonus, which allows the player to mark two to four targets (depending on the weapon selected) such as enemies or objects, and trigger the execution animation. Fisher will then dispatch all targets within a few seconds in an extraordinary fashion.
Interactive interrogation cutscenes where Fisher beats up a target for information do not require the player to do anything other than press [Interrogate]. Though if the player happens to be near an interactive object like a television or table, Fisher may use that to alter the standard animation.

==Development and history==

===Origin===
Although the series features his name, Tom Clancy had little to no involvement in the development of any of the installments.
According to series producer Mathieu Ferland, the original game was developed so that Ubisoft&#x27;s Montreal studio could demonstrate its full potential. After &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;, &quot;special ops was the natural next step&quot; for Clancy-endorsed games.

===Graphics and technology===
The first game in the series modified the Unreal Engine to allow the light-and-dark-based gameplay style. The other games continued this, using updated versions of the engine.

By the release of the latest game – &quot;Blacklist&quot; – the engine had been upgraded to the LEAD engine, a heavily modified version of the Unreal Engine 2.5. The game had active shadows on all consoles not simply as a graphical function – as in most games – but as a gameplay enhancer for the sake of the game&#x27;s stealth features. This meant that more coding for the game was required and overall, required a powerful desktop computer in order to get the best clarity and performance.

==Reception==
By the end of 2004, sales of the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series totaled 9.6 million units. By October 2005, the series&#x27; global sales had surpassed 12.5 million units. By May 2008, the series had sold 19 million units.

==Other media==
===Film adaptation===
Originally announced as a special feature on &quot;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot;, a film adaptation for the series was confirmed to be in development, as early as 2005.

In 2011, Ubisoft announced that &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;, and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; were all planned to receive film adaptations. The company officially stated, &quot;We want to keep ownership, retain control over the film content, and we&#x27;re open to work with studios on the development of our projects, and eventually collaborate on the pre-casting, pre-budget and script.&quot; The following year, it was reported that Warner Bros. Pictures and Paramount Pictures were the front-runners bidding to make a &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; film. By November, it was announced that British actor Tom Hardy was cast as Sam Fisher, while Eric Warren Singer was hired as screenwriter. By 2013, Ubisoft announced that the film would be made by New Regency, with Basil Iwanyk signed on as producer through his production company, Thunder Road Films.

In March 2014, Doug Liman joined the production as director, with Jean-Julien Baronnet and David Bartis attached as producers. Later that month, Sheldon Turner was brought into the production team, to write a new draft of the script. Hardy told &quot;Collider&quot; in an interview that the studio was hoping to start filming that August. By June that year, Liman stated that both he and Hardy were working on the film&#x27;s script, which would focus on a young Sam Fisher, in his prime as opposed to the portrayal of a seasoned spy in the video games. In October of the same year, Iwanyk stated that filming would start in early 2015.

In April 2015, Liman stepped down as director, with reports stating that the studio were talking with Joseph Kahn as his replacement. By July, Ubisoft hired Frank John Hughes to rewrite the film&#x27;s script. In January 2017, Iwanyk confirmed that the script had been completed and sent to Hardy to read over. The producer explained that the film was intended to have its own style within the action movie genre, and that the production team was aiming to make an &quot;edgy&quot; PG-13 rated film. However, on November 15, 2024, it was announced that the film has been cancelled, citing issues getting the script and budget up to the standard they desired.

===Anime series adaptation===

In late July 2020, streaming service company Netflix announced that an anime series adaptation is in the works from Ubisoft Film &amp; Television. &quot;John Wick&quot; writer Derek Kolstad will be serving as executive producer on the series, while the animation will be created by Sun Creature Studio and Fost.

===Radio drama===

A radio drama for BBC Radio 4 Limelight called &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Firewall&quot; was released 2 December 2022 and was adapted by Sebastian Baczkiewicz and Paul Cornell from the novel of the same name by James Swallow. It is an eight part series that follows the plot of the novel of the same name. It was recorded with binaural audio which is ideal for a headphone listening experience. The main voice actors include Andonis Anthony as Sam Fisher (replacing Michael Ironside as the traditional voice actor for the character), as well as Will Poulter, Daisy Head, Rosalie Craig, Sacha Dhawan, and Nikesh Patel. Other actors include Mihai Arsene, Olga Fedori, Rina Mahoney, Roger Ringrose, Riad Richie, David Hounslow, Tijan Sarr, Tom Kiteley, Joe Belham, Ali Gadema, Lloyd Thomas, and Charis Jardim-Hinds.

<text>Wild at Heart is a 1990 American romantic crime comedy-drama thriller film written and directed by David Lynch, based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Barry Gifford. Starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Willem Dafoe, Crispin Glover, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini, and Harry Dean Stanton, the film follows Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune, a young couple who go on the run from Lula&#x27;s domineering mother and the criminals she hires to kill Sailor.

Lynch intended only to produce the film, but after reading Gifford&#x27;s book, he decided to write and direct it as well. He disliked the ending of the novel and decided to change it to fit his vision of the main characters. The film is noted for its allusions to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and Elvis Presley. Early test screenings for the film were poorly received, with Lynch estimating that at least 300 people walked out due to its sexual and violent content.

&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, which at the time was considered a controversial decision. The film was theatrically released in the United States on August 17, 1990, to polarized reviews from critics and grossed $14 million against its $10 million budget. At the 6th Independent Spirit Awards, Dafoe was nominated for Best Supporting Male and Elmes won for Best Cinematography. Ladd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture at the 63rd Academy Awards and the 48th Golden Globe Awards, respectively. The film has been positively reevaluated by critics in the years since its release.

==Plot==
In Cape Fear, North Carolina, lovers Lula Fortune and Sailor Ripley are separated after he is jailed for killing a man who attacked him with a knife; the assailant, Bobby Ray Lemon, was hired by Lula&#x27;s mother, Marietta. Upon Sailor&#x27;s release 22 months later, Lula picks him up outside prison, where she hands him his snakeskin jacket. They have sex in a hotel room and go to see speed metal band Powermad. At the club, Sailor beats up a man for flirting with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of the Elvis Presley song &quot;Love Me&quot;. When Lula asks why Sailor didn’t sing her his favourite song, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, he tells her he will only ever sing it to his future wife.

Sailor asks Lula to run away to California with him, despite knowing this will break his parole. Marietta asks her on-off boyfriend, private detective Johnnie Farragut, to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, Marietta also hires her other boyfriend, gangster Marcello Santos, to track them and kill Sailor. When Santos calls mob boss Mr. Reindeer to arrange for the job, he adds Farragut to the hit list, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled psychosis. Despite her attempts to save Farragut, Mr. Reindeer&#x27;s assassins capture and kill him.

Unaware of these events, Lula and Sailor continue on their way until they encounter the aftermath of a two-car collision. They try to help the only survivor, a traumatized and brain-damaged young woman who eventually dies in front of them. Lula is disturbed, and considers it a bad omen. She is also unsettled by Sailor&#x27;s revelation that he had been Santos&#x27; driver and may have witnessed her father&#x27;s murder by Santos and Marietta, which places him in the latter&#x27;s crosshairs.

Nearly penniless, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he asks old acquaintance Perdita Durango whether someone is after him. Perdita says she is unaware of any murder contract, but is later revealed to be lying. At an outdoor party, Lula and Sailor meet career criminal Bobby Peru. Lula, who has been feeling ill, tells Sailor she is pregnant. While Sailor is changing their car&#x27;s oil, Lula waits for him in the motel room. Peru enters the room, deduces Lula&#x27;s pregnancy and proceeds to intimidate, grope and violently coerce her into asking him for sex; when she finally does, he mockingly reveals his threats to be a bluff and leaves. This traumatizes Lula, who was previously raped as a child.

Not knowing about Peru&#x27;s abuse of Lula, Sailor agrees to accompany him to a bar. Over beers, Peru enlists Sailor&#x27;s help in robbing a nearby feed store. During the robbery, Peru unnecessarily shoots the two store clerks and admits to Sailor that he has been hired to kill him, and that he handed Sailor a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is repeatedly shot by a sheriff&#x27;s deputy and accidentally blows his own head off with his shotgun. Sailor is sentenced to six years in prison for his part in the robbery.

While Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Lula decides to reunite with him upon his release, rejecting her mother&#x27;s objections over the phone. She throws water over Marietta&#x27;s photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son, Pace. The reunion is awkward and Sailor decides to leave them both, believing they will be better off without his influence. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor is accosted by members of a street gang, and is quickly knocked out after insulting them. While unconscious, he sees a vision of Glinda the Good Witch, who tells him, &quot;Don&#x27;t turn away from love, Sailor.&quot; When he awakens, Sailor apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, and runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta in Lula&#x27;s house sizzles and vanishes, symbolically mirroring the demise of Wicked Witch of the West. Sailor runs over the roofs and hoods of the cars in a traffic jam to reunite with Lula and Pace. When he catches up with them, he finally sings &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; to Lula, effectively proposing to her.

==Cast==
==Production==
In the summer of 1989, Lynch had finished the pilot episode for the successful television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and tried to rescue two of his projects—&quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot; and &quot;One Saliva Bubble&quot;—both involved in contractual complications as a result of the bankruptcy of Dino De Laurentiis, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, &#x27;I&#x27;ve had a bad time with obstacles...it wasn&#x27;t Dino&#x27;s fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that.&#x27; Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel, while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch&#x27;s and an associate producer on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for &quot;Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula&quot; but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Montgomery read it, and two days later he called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days after that, Montgomery gave Gifford&#x27;s book to Lynch while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, &#x27;That&#x27;s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?&#x27; Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his &#x27;kind of thing&#x27;. Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, &#x27;It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.&#x27; Lynch was drawn to what he saw as &#x27;a really modern romance in a violent world—a picture about finding love in Hell&#x27;, and was also attracted to &#x27;a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way&#x27;.

Lynch got approval from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production was scheduled to begin only two months after the rights had been purchased, forcing him to work fast. Lynch had Cage and Dern read Gifford&#x27;s book and wrote a draft in a week. By Lynch&#x27;s own admission, his first draft was &#x27;depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it&#x27;. Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford&#x27;s book, where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, &#x27;it honestly didn&#x27;t seem real, considering the way they felt about each other. It didn&#x27;t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn&#x27;t see it.&#x27; It was at this point that the director&#x27;s love of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) began to influence the script he was writing, and he included a reference to the &#x27;yellow brick road&#x27;. Lynch remembers, &#x27;It was an awful tough world, and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing.&#x27; Samuel Goldwyn Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford&#x27;s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, &#x27;much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn&#x27;t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying.&#x27;

Lynch added new characters, such as Mr. Reindeer and Sherilyn Fenn as the victim of a car accident. During rehearsals, Lynch began talking about Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe with Cage and Dern. He also acquired a copy of &quot;Elvis&#x27; Golden Records&quot; and after listening to it, called Cage and told him that he had to sing two songs, &quot;Love Me&quot; and &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. Cage agreed, and recorded them so that he could lip-synch to them on the set. Cage asked Lynch if he could wear a snakeskin jacket in the film, and Lynch incorporated it into his script. Before filming started, Dern suggested that she and Cage go on a weekend road trip to Las Vegas in order to bond and get a handle on their characters. Dern remembers, &#x27;We agreed that Sailor and Lula needed to be one person, one character, and we would each share it. I got the sexual, wild, Marilyn, gum-chewing fantasy, female side; Nick&#x27;s got the snakeskin, Elvis, raw, combustible, masculine side.&#x27; Within four months, Lynch began filming on August 9, 1989, in both Los Angeles (including the San Fernando Valley) and New Orleans with a relatively modest budget of $10 million. Originally, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; featured more explicit erotic scenes between Sailor and Lula. In one, she has an orgasm while relating to Sailor a dream she had of being ripped open by a wild animal. Another deleted scene had Lula lowering herself onto Sailor&#x27;s face saying, &#x27;Take a bite of Lula.&#x27;

===Soundtrack===
&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; features the Chris Isaak song &quot;Wicked Game&quot;, for which a music video was made—directed by Lynch, and featuring scenes of Sailor and Lula interspersed with black-and-white footage of Isaak performing the song.

==Themes==
According to Lynch, one of the film&#x27;s themes is, &#x27;finding love in Hell&#x27;. He has stated: &#x27;For me, it&#x27;s just a compilation of ideas that come along. The darker ones and the lighter ones, the humorous ones, all working together. You try to be as true as you can to those ideas and try to get them on film.&#x27; The film has been compared to Lynch&#x27;s previous &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, with both said to explore the dark side of the United States.

There are various references to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which has been interpreted as indicative of the overall fantasy world of the movie, which Sailor&#x27;s obsession with the fantasies of Elvis and the couple&#x27;s fantastical relationship also speak to. The movie also depicted a previously unseen level of violence. Lynch himself commented on interviews that the book on which the film was based was &quot;exactly the right thing at the right time&quot; and that &quot;Each year we give permission for people to get away with more&quot;.

Some critics have postulated that, similar to &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting that people who have the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness. However, Lynch himself refers to the ending of &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; as being &#x27;happy&#x27;, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.

==Release==
===Distribution===
Early test screenings for &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; did not go well, with the strong violence in some scenes being too much. At the first test screening, 80 people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut. Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film, and at the second screening, 100 walked out during this scene. Lynch remembers: &#x27;By then, I knew the scene was killing the film. So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but didn&#x27;t send people running from the theatre.&#x27; In retrospect, he said: &#x27;But that was part of what &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; was about: really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on.&#x27;

&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received &#x27;wild cheering&#x27; from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced the film as the winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or at the awards ceremony, the jeers almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. &quot;All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like &#x27;This is nothing like the book&#x27; or &#x27;He ruined my book&#x27;. I think everybody from &quot;Time&quot; magazine to &quot;What&#x27;s On in London&quot; was disappointed when I said &#x27;This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It&#x27;s like a big, dark, musical comedy&#x27;&quot;.

====Rating====
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) told Lynch that the version of &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; screened at Cannes would receive an X rating in North America unless cuts were made, as the NC-17 was not in effect in 1990, at the time of the film&#x27;s release; he was contractually obligated to deliver an R-rated film. Lynch made one change in the scene where Willem Dafoe&#x27;s character shoots his own head off with a shotgun. Gun smoke was added to tone down the blood and hide the removal of Dafoe&#x27;s head from his body. Foreign prints were not affected. The Region 1 DVD and all Blu-rays contain the toned-down version of the shotgun scene.

==Response==
===Box office===
&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; opened in the United States on August 17, 1990, in a limited release of only 532 theaters, grossing 2,913,764 in its opening weekend. It went into wide release on August 31 with 618 theaters and grossing an additional $1,858,379. The film ultimately grossed $14,560,247 in North America.

===Reception ===
&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; initially received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 66% based on 56 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &#x27;One of director David Lynch&#x27;s more uneven efforts, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; is held together by his distinctive sensibilities and compelling work from Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern.&#x27; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &#x27;mixed or average reviews&#x27;.

In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of a possible four. He felt that Lynch &quot;is a good director&quot;, but he was also bothered a few scenes of &quot;particularly offensive violence&quot; and possible undercurrents of racism and misogyny: &quot;If [Lynch] ever goes ahead and makes a film about what’s really on his mind, instead of hiding behind sophomoric humor and the cop-out of &#x27;parody&#x27;, he may realize the early promise of his &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. But he likes the box office prizes that go along with his pop satires, so he makes dishonest movies like this one.&#x27; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film one and a half stars out of four and said: &quot;This attempt at a one-up also trumpets its weirdness, but this time the agenda seems forced.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, &#x27;Perhaps the major problem is that despite Cage and Dern&#x27;s best efforts, Lynch is ultimately interested only in iconography, not characters at all. When it comes to images of evil, corruption, derangement, raw passion and mutilation (roughly in that order), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; is a veritable cornucopia.&#x27; Richard Combs in his review for &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;The result is a pile-up, of innocence, of evil, even of actual road accidents, without a context to give significance to the casualties or survivors&quot;. Christopher Sharrett, in &quot;Cineaste magazine&quot;, wrote: &#x27;Lynch&#x27;s characters are now so cartoony, one is prone to address him more as a theorist than director, except he is not that challenging...one is never sure what Lynch likes or dislikes, and his often striking images are too often lacking in compassion for us to accept him as a chronicler of a moribund landscape a la Fellini.&#x27; However, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers wrote: &#x27;Starting with the outrageous and building from there, he ignites a slight love-on-the-run novel, creating a bonfire of a movie that confirms his reputation as the most exciting and innovative filmmaker of his generation.&#x27;

===Legacy===
Despite mixed initial reviews, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; came to be viewed favorably in subsequent years. It was ranked the 47th best film of the 1990s in an IndieWire critics&#x27; poll, the 26th greatest film of the same period in a &quot;Complex&quot; poll, and the 53rd best in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s poll.

===Awards and honors===

<doc id="246972" wikidata="Q727803" url="?curid=246972" title="Canterbury scene">
<text>The Canterbury scene (or Canterbury sound) is a musical scene that originated in the city of Canterbury, Kent, England during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Associated with progressive rock, the term describes a loosely-defined, improvisational style that blended elements of jazz, rock, and psychedelia.

These musicians played together in numerous bands, with ever-changing and overlapping personnel, creating some similarities in their musical output. Many prominent British avant-garde or fusion musicians began their career in Canterbury bands, including Hugh Hopper, Steve Hillage, Dave Stewart, Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers, Richard Sinclair, Daevid Allen, and Mike Ratledge.

==Definition and history==
The Canterbury scene is largely defined by a set of musicians and bands with intertwined members. These are not tied by very strong musical similarities, but a certain whimsicality, touches of psychedelia, rather abstruse lyrics, and a use of improvisation derived from jazz are common elements in their work. &quot;The real essence of &#x27;Canterbury Sound&#x27; is the tension between complicated harmonies, extended improvisations, and the sincere desire to write catchy pop songs.&quot; &quot;In the very best Canterbury music...the musically silly and the musically serious are juxtaposed in an amusing and endearing way.&quot;

There is variation within the scene, for example from pop/rock like early Soft Machine and much Caravan to avant-garde composed pieces as with early National Health to improvised jazz as with later Soft Machine or In Cahoots. Didier Malherbe (of Gong) has defined the scene as having &quot;certain chord changes, in particular the use of minor second chords, certain harmonic combinations, and a great clarity in the aesthetics, and a way of improvising that is very different from what is done in jazz.&quot;

There is debate about the existence and definition of the scene. Dave Stewart has complained at the nomenclature as he and many other musicians identified with the Canterbury scene never had anything to do with Canterbury, the place. The former Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper, who lived in Whitstable, near Canterbury, said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a rather artificial label, a journalistic thing... I don&#x27;t mind it, but people like Robert [Wyatt], he in fact hates that idea, because he was born somewhere else and just happened to go to school here. In the time when the Wilde Flowers started we hardly ever worked in Canterbury. It wasn&#x27;t until Robert and Daevid [Allen] went to London to start Soft Machine that anything happened at all. They weren&#x27;t really a Canterbury band [...] if it helps people understand or listen to more music then it is fine.&quot;

In the 21st century, the Canterbury group Syd Arthur have been seen as latter-day practitioners.

==Others==
Poet, painter, and singer Lady June was regarded an &quot;honorary member&quot; of the Canterbury scene for having performed and recorded with some of the members, and being a &quot;landlady&quot; to many in her flat in Maida Vale, London.

<text>In term logic (a branch of philosophical logic), the square of opposition is a diagram representing the relations between the four basic categorical propositions.
The origin of the square can be traced back to Aristotle&#x27;s tractate &quot;On Interpretation&quot; and its distinction between two oppositions: contradiction and contrariety. However, Aristotle did not draw any diagram; this was done several centuries later by Boethius.

== Summary ==
In traditional logic, a proposition (Latin: &quot;propositio&quot;) is a spoken assertion (&quot;oratio enunciativa&quot;), not the meaning of an assertion, as in modern philosophy of language and logic. A &quot;categorical proposition&quot; is a simple proposition containing two terms, subject () and predicate (), in which the predicate is either asserted or denied of the subject.

Every categorical proposition can be reduced to one of four logical forms, named , , , and based on the Latin &#x27; (I affirm), for the affirmative propositions and , and &#x27; (I deny), for the negative propositions and . These are:
* The proposition, the universal affirmative (&quot;universalis affirmativa&quot;), whose form in Latin is &#x27;omne est &#x27;, usually translated as &#x27;every is a &#x27;.
* The proposition, the universal negative (&quot;universalis negativa&quot;), Latin form &#x27;nullum est &#x27;, usually translated as &#x27;no are &#x27;.
* The proposition, the particular affirmative (&quot;particularis affirmativa&quot;), Latin &#x27;quoddam est &#x27;, usually translated as &#x27;some are &#x27;.
* The proposition, the particular negative (&quot;particularis negativa&quot;), Latin &#x27;quoddam nōn est &#x27;, usually translated as &#x27;some are not &#x27;.

In tabular form:

*Proposition may be stated as &quot;All is .&quot; However, Proposition when stated correspondingly as &quot;All is not .&quot; is ambiguous because it can be either an or proposition, thus requiring a context to determine the form; the standard form &quot;No is &quot; is unambiguous, so it is preferred. Proposition also takes the forms &quot;Sometimes is not .&quot; and &quot;A certain is not .&quot; (literally the Latin &#x27;Quoddam nōn est .&#x27;)

** formula_1 in the modern forms means that a statement formula_2 applies on an object formula_3. It may be simply interpreted as &quot;formula_3 is formula_2&quot; in many cases. formula_1 can be also written as formula_7.

Aristotle states (in chapters six and seven of the &quot;Peri hermēneias&quot; (Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, Latin &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, English &#x27;On Interpretation&#x27;)), that there are certain logical relationships between these four kinds of proposition. He says that to every affirmation there corresponds exactly one negation, and that every affirmation and its negation are &#x27;opposed&#x27; such that always one of them must be true, and the other false. A pair of an affirmative statement and its negation is, he calls, a &#x27;contradiction&#x27; (in medieval Latin, &quot;contradictio&quot;). Examples of contradictories are &#x27;every man is white&#x27; and &#x27;not every man is white&#x27; (also read as &#x27;some men are not white&#x27;), &#x27;no man is white&#x27; and &#x27;some man is white&#x27;.

The below relations, contrary, subcontrary, subalternation, and superalternation, do hold based on the traditional logic assumption that things stated as (or things satisfying a statement in modern logic) exist. If this assumption is taken out, then these relations do not hold.

&#x27;Contrary&#x27; (medieval: &quot;contrariae&quot;) statements, are such that both statements cannot be true at the same time. Examples of these are the universal affirmative &#x27;every man is white&#x27;, and the universal negative &#x27;no man is white&#x27;. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every man is white, since some men are not white. Yet it is also false that no man is white, since there are some white men.

Since every statement has the contradictory opposite (its negation), and since a contradicting statement is true when its opposite is false, it follows that the opposites of contraries (which the medievals called subcontraries, &quot;subcontrariae&quot;) can both be true, but they cannot both be false. Since subcontraries are negations of universal statements, they were called &#x27;particular&#x27; statements by the medieval logicians.

Another logical relation implied by this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is &#x27;alternation&#x27; (&quot;alternatio&quot;), consisting of &#x27;subalternation&#x27; and &#x27;superalternation&#x27;. Subalternation is a relation between the particular statement and the universal statement of the same quality (affirmative or negative) such that the particular is implied by the universal, while superalternation is a relation between them such that the falsity of the universal (equivalently the negation of the universal) is implied by the falsity of the particular (equivalently the negation of the particular). (The superalternation is the contrapositive of the subalternation.) In these relations, the particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular&#x27;s superaltern. For example, if &#x27;every man is white&#x27; is true, its contrary &#x27;no man is white&#x27; is false. Therefore, the contradictory &#x27;some man is white&#x27; is true. Similarly the universal &#x27;no man is white&#x27; implies the particular &#x27;not every man is white&#x27;.

In summary:
* Universal statements are contraries: &#x27;every man is just&#x27; and &#x27;no man is just&#x27; cannot be true together, although one may be true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one man is just, and at least one man is not just).
* Particular statements are subcontraries. &#x27;Some man is just&#x27; and &#x27;some man is not just&#x27; cannot be false together.
* The particular statement of one quality is the subaltern of the universal statement of that same quality, which is the superaltern of the particular statement because in Aristotelian semantics &#x27;every is &#x27; implies &#x27;some is &#x27; and &#x27;no is &#x27; implies &#x27;some is not &#x27;. Note that modern formal interpretations of English sentences interpret &#x27;every is &#x27; as &#x27;for any , a statement that is implies a statement that is &#x27;, which does &quot;not&quot; imply &#x27;some is . This is a matter of semantic interpretation, however, and does not mean, as is sometimes claimed, that Aristotelian logic is &#x27;wrong&#x27;.
* The universal affirmative () and the particular negative () are contradictories. If some is not , then not every is . Conversely, though this is not the case in modern semantics, it was thought that if every is not , some is not . This interpretation has caused difficulties (see below). While Aristotle&#x27;s Greek does not represent the particular negative as &#x27;some is not , but as &#x27;not every is &#x27;, someone in his commentary on the &quot;Peri hermaneias&quot;, renders the particular negative as &#x27;quoddam A nōn est &#x27;, literally &#x27;a certain is not a &#x27;, and in all medieval writing on logic it is customary to represent the particular proposition in this way.

These relationships became the basis of a diagram originating with Boethius and used by medieval logicians to classify the logical relationships. The propositions are placed in the four corners of a square, and the relations represented as lines drawn between them, whence the name &#x27;The Square of Opposition&#x27;.
Therefore, the following cases can be made:
# If is true, then is false, is true, is false;
# If is true, then is false, is false, is true;
# If is true, then is false, and are indeterminate;
# If is true, then is false, and are indeterminate;
# If is false, then is true, and are indeterminate;
# If is false, then is true, and are indeterminate;
# If is false, then is false, is true, is true;
# If is false, then is true, is false, is true.

To memorize them, the medievals invented the following Latin rhyme:
:&quot; adfirmat, negat , sed universaliter ambae; firmat, negat , sed particulariter ambae.&quot;
It affirms that and are not neither both true nor both false in each of the above cases. The same applies to and . While the first two are universal statements, the couple / refers to particular ones.

The Square of Oppositions was used for the categorical inferences described by the Greek philosopher Aristotle: conversion, obversion and contraposition. Each of those three types of categorical inference was applied to the four Boethian logical forms: , , , and .

== The problem of existential import ==

Subcontraries ( and ), which medieval logicians represented in the form &#x27;quoddam est &#x27; (some particular is ) and &#x27;quoddam non est &#x27; (some particular is not ) cannot both be false, since their universal contradictory statements (no is / every is ) cannot both be true. This leads to a difficulty firstly identified by Peter Abelard (1079 – 21 April 1142). &#x27;Some is &#x27; seems to imply &#x27;something is &#x27;, in other words, there exists something that is . For example, &#x27;Some man is white&#x27; seems to imply that at least one thing that exists is a man, namely the man who has to be white, if &#x27;some man is white&#x27; is true. But, &#x27;some man is not white&#x27; also implies that something as a man exists, namely the man who is not white, if the statement &#x27;some man is not white&#x27; is true. But Aristotelian logic requires that, necessarily, one of these statements (more generally &#x27;some particular is &#x27; and &#x27;some particular is not &#x27;) is true, i.e., they cannot both be false. Therefore, since both statements imply the presence of at least one thing that is a man, the presence of a man or men is followed. But, as Abelard points out in the &quot;Dialectica&quot;, surely men might not exist?

: For with absolutely no man existing, neither the proposition &#x27;every man is a man&#x27; is true nor &#x27;some man is not a man&#x27;.

Abelard also points out that subcontraries containing subject terms denoting nothing, such as &#x27;a man who is a stone&#x27;, are both false.

: If &#x27;every stone-man is a stone&#x27; is true, also its conversion &quot;per accidens&quot; is true (&#x27;some stones are stone-men&#x27;). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this &#x27;a certain stone-man is not a stone&#x27; is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.

Terence Parsons (born 1939) argues that ancient philosophers did not experience the problem of existential import as only the A (universal affirmative) and I (particular affirmative) forms had existential import. (If a statement includes a term such that the statement is false if the term has no instances, i.e., no thing associated with the term exists, then the statement is said to have &quot;existential import&quot; with respect to that term.)

: Affirmatives have existential import, and negatives do not. The ancients thus did not see the incoherence of the square as formulated by Aristotle because there was no incoherence to see.

He goes on to cite a medieval philosopher William of Ockham (1215–35 – ),
:In affirmative propositions a term is always asserted to supposit for something. Thus, if it supposits for nothing the proposition is false. However, in negative propositions the assertion is either that the term does not supposit for something or that it supposits for something of which the predicate is truly denied. Thus a negative proposition has two causes of truth.

And points to Boethius&#x27; translation of Aristotle&#x27;s work as giving rise to the mistaken notion that the form has existential import.

:But when Boethius (477 – 524 AD) comments on this text he illustrates Aristotle&#x27;s doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he uses the wording &#x27;Some man is not just&#x27;. So this must have seemed to him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in English, but he wasn&#x27;t bothered by it.

==Modern squares of opposition==

In the 19th century, George Boole (November 1815 – 8 December 1864) argued for requiring existential import on both terms in particular claims ( and ), but allowing all terms of universal claims ( and ) to lack existential import. This decision made Venn diagrams particularly easy to use for term logic. The square of opposition, under this Boolean set of assumptions, is often called the &quot;modern square of opposition&quot;. In the modern square of opposition, and claims are contradictories, as are and , but all other forms of opposition cease to hold; there are no contraries, subcontraries, subalternations, and superalternations. Thus, from a modern point of view, it often makes sense to talk about &#x27;the&#x27; opposition of a claim, rather than insisting, as older logicians did, that a claim has several different opposites, which are in different kinds of opposition with the claim.

Gottlob Frege (8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925)&#x27;s &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; also presents a square of oppositions, organised in an almost identical manner to the classical square, showing the contradictories, subalternates and contraries between four formulae constructed from universal quantification, negation and implication.

Algirdas Julien Greimas (9 March 1917 – 27 February 1992)&#x27; semiotic square was derived from Aristotle&#x27;s work.

The traditional square of opposition is now often compared with squares based on inner- and outer-negation.

== Logical hexagons and other bi-simplexes ==
The square of opposition has been extended to a logical hexagon which includes the relationships of six statements. It was discovered independently by both Augustin Sesmat (April 7, 1885 – December 12, 1957) and Robert Blanché (1898–1975). It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a &quot;logical cube&quot;, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called &quot;logical bi-simplexes of dimension .&quot; The pattern also goes even beyond this.

== Square of opposition (or logical square) and modal logic ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of Apuleius, has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: &quot;Every man is bad,&quot; the universal affirmative - The negation of the universal affirmative &quot;Not every man is bad&quot; (or &quot;Some men are not bad&quot;) - &quot;Some men are bad,&quot; the particular affirmative - and finally, the negation of the particular affirmative &quot;No man is bad&quot;. Robert Blanché published with Vrin his Structures intellectuelles in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the logical hexagon which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language.

== Set-theoretical interpretation of categorical statements ==
In modern mathematical logic, statements containing words &quot;all&quot;, &quot;some&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, can be stated in terms of set theory if we assume a set-like domain of discourse. If the set of all &#x27;s is labeled as formula_8 and the set of all &#x27;s as formula_9, then:

* &quot;All is &quot; (AaB) is equivalent to &quot;formula_8 is a subset of formula_9&quot;, or formula_12.
* &quot;No is &quot; (AeB) is equivalent to &quot;The intersection of formula_8 and formula_9 is empty&quot;, or formula_15.
* &quot;Some is &quot; (AiB) is equivalent to &quot;The intersection of formula_8 and formula_9 is not empty&quot;, or formula_18.
* &quot;Some is not &quot; (AoB) is equivalent to &quot;formula_8 is not a subset of formula_9&quot;, or formula_21.

By definition, the empty set formula_22 is a subset of all sets. From this fact it follows that, according to this mathematical convention, if there are no &#x27;s, then the statements &quot;All is &quot; and &quot;No is &quot; are always true whereas the statements &quot;Some is &quot; and &quot;Some is not &quot; are always false. This also implies that AaB does not entail AiB, and some of the syllogisms mentioned above are not valid when there are no &#x27;s (formula_23).

<text>The Saskatchewan River (Cree: , &quot;swift flowing river&quot;) is a major river in Canada. It stretches about from where it is formed by the joining of the North Saskatchewan River and South Saskatchewan River just east of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It flows roughly eastward across Saskatchewan and Manitoba to empty into Lake Winnipeg. Through its tributaries the North Saskatchewan and South Saskatchewan, its watershed encompasses much of the prairie regions of Canada, stretching westward to the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and north-western Montana in the United States.

Including its tributaries, it reaches to its farthest headwaters on the Bow River, a tributary of the South Saskatchewan in Alberta.

== Description ==

It is formed in central Saskatchewan, approximately east of Prince Albert, by the confluence of its two major branches, the North Saskatchewan and the South Saskatchewan, at the Saskatchewan River Forks. Both source rivers originate from glaciers in the Alberta Rockies. The St. Mary River, draining the Hudson Bay Divide region of Glacier National Park (U.S.), also empties into the Saskatchewan River via the south fork.

The combined stream flows east-northeast, into Codette Lake formed by the Francois Finlay Dam at Nipawin then into Tobin Lake, formed by the E.B. Campbell Dam. It then flows northeast, passing through a region of marshes, where it is joined from the northwest by the Torch River and the Mossy River. At the northern edge of the marshes it flows east, twisting between a series of small lakes into west-central Manitoba to The Pas, where it is joined from the southwest by the Carrot and Pasquia Rivers. Southeast of The Pas, it forms several streams in a delta on the northwest side of Cedar Lake, then exiting the lake on its southeast end and flowing approximately to Lake Winnipeg, entering on the northwest shore north of Long Point. The waters of Lake Winnipeg eventually drain into Hudson Bay, via the Nelson River.

The river, like the province of Saskatchewan, takes its name from the Cree word , meaning &quot;swift flowing river&quot;. The river and its tributaries provided an important route of transportation for First Nations and early European trappers.

In Saskatchewan, SaskPower owns and operates E.B. Campbell (289 MW, formerly Squaw Rapids) and Nipawin (255 MW) Hydroelectric Stations.

In Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro owns and operates Grand Rapids Generating Station.

=== Proposed hydroelectric facilities ===
The Choiceland Generating Station would be located upstream of the Nipawin site. It would consist of four 150 MW generating units, providing 300 MW of baseload power, and an additional 300 MW of peaking power.

The Forks Generating Station would be located downstream of the North and South Saskatchewan River Forks, and would be approximately the same size as the Nipawin Station (255 MW of baseload power, and 420 MW of peak power). In 2019, James Smith Cree Nation began developing the project with AECOM and Tesla Energy.

== History ==
The river, labelled as the &quot;Kish-stock-ewen&quot; is identified on a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company map of 1760, produced from oral information from a First Nations man named Attickasish who had been Anthony Henday&#x27;s guide. Another map from 1774 shows a fairly accurate course of the river.

The Saskatchewan River and its two major tributaries formed an important transportation route during the precontact, fur trade, and early settlement periods in the Canadian West. In early fur trading days the South Saskatchewan tributary was known as &quot;La Fourche des Gros Ventres&quot; (&quot;Fork of the Great Gorges&quot;) and the North Saskatchewan was known as &quot;Rivière du Pas&quot;.

First Nations inhabiting the area of the rivers included at one time or another the Atsina, Cree, Saulteaux, Blackfoot Confederacy, Assiniboine, and Sioux.

Henry Kelsey penetrated the area in the 1690s for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne, established the farthest western post of the French Empire in America (See New France) just east of the Saskatchewan River Forks at Fort de la Corne. In addition to this the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North West Company both ran numerous fur posts up the river and its two branches throughout the late 18th to late 19th centuries. York boats and canoes formed the primary means of travel during the fur trade period.

In the mid-19th century Metis settlements became important along stretches of the Saskatchewan river system, notably at the Southbranch Settlement, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and St. Albert, Alberta.

Riverboats were introduced from the Red River of the North in the 19th century and remained an important means of transportation until the 1890s and the coming of railways to the area.

The earliest settlements in Saskatchewan and Alberta generally were established around the rivers. Examples include Fort Edmonton (Edmonton, Alberta), Fort Battleford (Battleford, Saskatchewan), Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and Cumberland House, Saskatchewan.

Fur trade on the lower river: The first European to ascend the river as far as the forks was Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye in spring 1739. The main posts on the river were (landmarks in parentheses): (Saskatchewan River Forks) Fort La Jonquière (?), Fort de la Corne, Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, (The Pas):second Fort Paskoya, (inflow to Cedar Lake:) first Fort Paskoya and second Fort Bourbon, (Cedar Lake), (inflow to Lake Winnipeg:) Grand Rapids, Manitoba, and first Fort Bourbon. There were also a number of temporary posts that have left few records. By far the most important post was Cumberland House which was the depot for the route northwest to the rich Athabasca country. To the west, the North Saskatchewan had the greatest number of posts. North Saskatchewan is the northern-most major river of the western prairies that flows into the Hudson Bay.

== In popular culture ==
The Saskatchewan River, and its two main tributaries, are featured in The Arrogant Worms&#x27; song &quot;The Last Saskatchewan Pirate&quot;. While the lyrics imply that the Saskatchewan flows through Moose Jaw, Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan, only Saskatoon, on the South Saskatchewan River, sees the waters of this river system; the closest point to both Moose Jaw and Regina are Lake Diefenbaker, a bifurcation lake on the South Saskatchewan, roughly and to their west-northwest, respectively.

== Fish species ==
Fish species include: walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake whitefish, mooneye, goldeye, white sucker, longnose sucker, shorthead redhorse, burbot, rainbow trout, brown trout, and lake sturgeon. In 2008 the presence of reproducing Prussian carp were found in the Red Deer River drainage basin which flows into the Saskatchewan River. Illegal introductions of non native species can have serious wide-ranging negative impacts on the ecosystem. While the exact species is not yet determined the genus is Carassius. The Blue Ribbon Bow River Trout fishery may be at risk as a result of this introduction. Illegal introductions of Carassius can be very harmful.

<text>The IBM 1720 was a pilot project to create a real-time process control computer based on the IBM 1620 Model I.

Only three 1720 systems were ever built: one for the Amoco oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana; one for the Socal oil refinery in El Segundo, California; and one for E. I. du Pont in Wilmington, Delaware. All were installed in 1961. The Amoco and Socal systems ran for many years.

The 1720 led to the IBM 1710 Process Control systems that IBM introduced in March 1961; these were cheaper and less elaborate than the 1720.

<doc id="246987" wikidata="Q542071" url="?curid=246987" title="Faithless">
<text>Faithless are an English dance music band that formed in 1995, with its core members being Rollo, Sister Bliss and Maxi Jazz. During the band&#x27;s initial period of success, Sister Bliss and Maxi Jazz contributed to studio recordings and toured frequently under the Faithless name, while Rollo served as a studio only member and did not tour with the band. Their first album, &quot;Reverence&quot;, was released in 1996 and their most recent, &quot;All Blessed&quot;, in 2020. They have sold millions of physical records, and their catalogue was uploaded to streaming sites in 2018. They average almost 3 million listeners a month on Spotify. Faithless&#x27; records have charted at No. 1 in numerous countries and they were voted the 4th greatest dance band of all time by &quot;Mixmag&quot;.

Their lyrical style has been seen as sociopolitical. &quot;All Blessed&quot; uses award-winning photo-journalist Yannis Behrakis&#x27; picture of refugees on the front, focusing on immigration as its core theme.

Faithless have headlined numerous major festivals in Europe and beyond, including four editions of Glastonbury.

== History ==
=== 1990s ===
Faithless were founded in 1995. Jazz had his musical beginnings in hip-hop, and was a rapper on the local scene in South London since the mid-1980s. Bliss&#x27; and Rollo&#x27;s primary interests were in electronic music.

Faithless&#x27; first album &quot;Reverence&quot; was conceived as a mixtape which covers many genres, encapsulating house, hip-hop, folk and classical music. The album was released on Rollo&#x27;s label, Cheeky Records.

Their first show at Camden’s Jazz cafe to showcase &quot;Reverence&quot; was a sell-out, and a global tour ensued as the record went up the charts all over Europe. The singles &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;Salva Mea&quot; each selling over a million copies, and album going either platinum or gold in every European territory.

The second studio album, Mercury-nominated &quot;Sunday 8PM&quot;, contained the global hit &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; and established Faithless as a major touring force in 1998. Emotive videos were directed by featured vocalist Jamie Catto, featuring the band’s transcendent live shows, and helped bring Faithless’ live prowess to the attention of music fans. They were nominated for Best British Dance Act at the Brit Awards in 1999. The same year, Catto departed the band to form 1 Giant Leap.

=== 2000s ===

In 2001, their third album &quot;Outrospective&quot; was the first to be released on major label Sony BMG and captured the dreamy synergy between sadness and mad delirium giving rise to hit singles &quot;We Come 1&quot; and a tribute to Muhammad Ali. In 2002, they performed on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, with another nomination for best British Dance Act at The Brit Awards in the same year. They won Best Dance and Best Live Act at the TMF Awards in the Netherlands in 2001.

In 2004, their fourth album &quot;No Roots&quot; debuted at number 1 in the UK, conceived as a conceptual continuous piece of music in one key, with strong lyrical gravitas it featured vocals from Dido, new collaborator L.S.K, and the late Nina Simone. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters cited Faithless’ hit protest song &quot;Mass Destruction&quot; as the song he most wished he had written during an interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine, and the lyrics were quoted in the US Senate. A powerful video directed by award-winning directing team Dom &amp; Nick alluded to abuses of power during the Iraq War to chilling effect, tracing the connection from childhood bullying to terrorism and genocide.

Encouraged by their label, Faithless released a Greatest Hits album, &quot;Forever Faithless&quot;. The Greatest Hits album went four times platinum and was the best-selling dance album of 2005. A huge global tour followed the success of the album.

Their fifth album, &quot;To All New Arrivals&quot;, was released in 2006. It was inspired by the uncertain futures facing Sister Bliss’ recently-born son, and Rollo’s young family, exploring themes of global poverty, immigration, conflict and belonging through the concept of &quot;new arrivals&quot;. The first single &quot;Bombs&quot;, with its anti-war message and video directed by director Howard Greenhalgh, was not playlisted on daytime MTV or BBC Radio 1. The album also featured collaborations with Cat Power and Robert Smith of The Cure. The band played Coachella Valley Festival in 2007.

=== 2010s: Hiatuses and Jazz&#x27;s departure ===

Their sixth album &quot;The Dance&quot; was released on 16 May 2010, after a four-year recording break for the band, on their own label &quot;Nate’s Tunes&quot; - and was 2nd in the UK album charts behind The Rolling Stones. Faithless again played the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in 2010, as well as other festivals around the world, and arenas. They were seen by over one million people and sold over 400,000 records. Faithless performed at Brixton Academy on 7 and 8 April 2011 and was transmitted live via satellite to cinemas across Europe.

In 2015, Faithless released a remix album under the banner of &quot;Faithless 2.0&quot;. The studio album featured contributions from the biggest names in electronic music including Avicii, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Claptone and Booka Shade. The album contained tracks from their 25-year career, encompassing seventeen Top 40 singles, six Top 10 albums and they embarked on a tour to celebrate the album released. In 2015 and 2016, the band played a series of live dates under the Faithless 2.0 banner, featuring Maxi Jazz and a full live band. Jazz left the group for the final time in 2016.

=== 2020s: &quot;All Blessed&quot;, death of Maxi Jazz, and &quot;Champion Sound&quot;===

After a seven-year recording hiatus, the seventh Faithless studio album &quot;All Blessed&quot; was released in October 2020. The release came in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the themes of the album weaving around immigration, identity, empathy and lack of it. The first track that was officially released from the album came on the same weekend as the album release, Synthesizer, a love letter to electronic music. The album features vocals from newcomers Nathan Ball and spoken word artist &amp; poet Suli Breaks, along with Caleb Femi. Other notable appearances on the album include Soul II Soul founder Jazzie B, Gaika, and Damien Jurado. Rollo said of the album, &quot;We want to give them something else – something that could breathe.&quot; It continued their top 3 chart success in the UK and Europe.

On 23 December 2022, Maxi Jazz died &quot;peacefully in his sleep&quot; at his home in London, England at the age of 65. Seven days later, the band&#x27;s compilation &quot;Forever Faithless&quot; re-entered the UK Album Downloads chart at number 7.

In January 2024, Bliss announced that Faithless were returning to the &quot;live arena&quot; after eight years, with the group confirmed for dates including Camp Bestival in Shropshire in August that year. On 12 July 2024, Faithless released the single &quot;Find A Way&quot;, which features Suli Breaks. On the same day, they announced the title of their upcoming eighth studio album, &quot;Champion Sound&quot;. On 30 August 2024, the group released the single &quot;I&#x27;m Not Alone (Rest Well Maxwell)&quot; which features Amelia Fox and LSK, in tribute to Maxi Jazz. On the same day, they announced The Champion Sound Tour, which will visit UK and European cities in November and December 2024.

==Other work==
In between album releases, Faithless also released compilation albums revealing more of their personality and influence including the long-running Back to Mine sessions as well as NME in Association with War Child Presents 1 Love, The Bedroom Sessions and the Renaissance 3D music project, in conjunction with the iconic Renaissance nightclub.

As well as their own studio albums, all three members have actively engaged in other people&#x27;s work as solo artists.

Sister Bliss is a prominent dance DJ and has for a long time toured the circuit on her own, and has also scored numerous TV, film and theatre productions, along with presenting an award-winning Bauer Media show on Scala Radio joining the dots between classical and electronic music. Sister Bliss’ hugely successful weekly radio show and podcast ‘Sister Bliss in Session’, is syndicated to over 100 stations &amp; 43 countries worldwide, and has around 10 million listeners per month and 60,000 podcast downloads per month.

Rollo released a solo record in 2019 under the moniker &quot;R PLUS&quot; called &quot;The Last Summer&quot; which features Dido. On 13 May 2022 he released &quot;WeDisappear&quot;, a collaboration album with Amelia Fox. &quot;Makes Me Feel Good&quot; and an edited version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Really Have Some Fun&quot;, released 28 April 2023, were released as singles. On 24 November 2023, the album, &quot;For Lovers, Not Killers&quot; was released, once again in collaboration with Amelia Fox.
The R Plus albums have erroneously been credited to Faithless on many streaming services.

Maxi Jazz also collaborated with Faithless founding member Jamie Catto on his project &quot;1 Giant Leap&quot; and released an album with his band Maxi Jazz and the E-Type Boys.

Finally, Rollo founded the label Cheeky Records and has produced the music of other artists, most notably his sister Dido&#x27;s albums, as well as using various monikers to create popular dance music under the names Rollo Goes... (Camping, Mystic and Spiritual), Felix, Our Tribe (with Rob Dougan), and Dusted.

<text>A cookbook or cookery book is a kitchen reference containing recipes.

Cookbooks may be general, or may specialize in a particular cuisine or category of food.

Recipes in cookbooks are organized in various ways: by course (appetizer, first course, main course, dessert), by main ingredient, by cooking technique, alphabetically, by region or country, and so on. They may include illustrations of finished dishes and preparation steps; discussions of cooking techniques, advice on kitchen equipment, ingredients, tips, and substitutions; historical and cultural notes; and so on.

Cookbooks may be written by individual authors, who may be chefs, cooking teachers, or other food writers; they may be written by collectives; or they may be anonymous. They may be addressed to home cooks, to professional restaurant cooks, to institutional cooks, or to more specialized audiences.

Some cookbooks are didactic, with detailed recipes addressed to beginners or people learning to cook particular dishes or cuisines; others are simple aide-memoires, which may document the composition of a dish or even precise measurements, but not detailed techniques.

==History==

===Early works===


Not all cultures left written records of their culinary practices, but some examples have survived, notably three Akkadian tablets from Ancient Mesopotamia, dating to about 1700 BC, large fragments from Archestratus, the Latin &quot;Apicius&quot; and some texts from the Tang dynasty.

The earliest collection of recipes that has survived in Europe is &quot;De re coquinaria&quot;, written in Latin. An early version was first compiled sometime in the 1st century and has often been attributed to the Roman gourmet Marcus Gavius Apicius, though this has been cast in doubt by modern research. An &quot;Apicius&quot; came to designate a book of recipes. The current text appears to have been compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century; the first print edition is from 1483. It records a mix of ancient Greek and Roman cuisine, but with few details on preparation and cooking.

An abbreviated epitome entitled &quot;Apici Excerpta a Vinidario&quot;, a &quot;pocket Apicius&quot; by Vinidarius, &quot;an illustrious man&quot;, was made in the Carolingian era. In spite of its late date it represents the last manifestation of the cuisine of Antiquity.

===Medieval===

====Asian====
The earliest cookbooks known in Arabic are those of al-Warraq (an early 10th-century compendium of recipes from the 9th and 10th centuries) and al-Baghdadi (13th century).

&quot;Manasollasa&quot; from India contains recipes of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines. While the text is not the first among Indian books to describe fermented foods, it contains a range of cuisines based on fermentation of cereals and flours.

Chinese recipe books are known from the Tang dynasty, but most were lost. One of the earliest surviving Chinese-language cookbooks is Hu Sihui&#x27;s &quot;Yinshan Zhengyao&quot; (Important Principles of Food and Drink), believed to be from 1330. Hu Sihui, Buyantu Khan&#x27;s dietitian and therapist, recorded a Chinese-inflected Central Asian cuisine as eaten by the Yuan court; his recipes were adapted from foods eaten all over the Mongol Empire. &quot;Eumsik dimibang&quot;, written around 1670, is the oldest Korean cookbook and the first cookbook written by a woman in East Asia.

====European====
After a long interval, the first recipe books to be compiled in Europe since Late Antiquity started to appear in the late thirteenth century. About a hundred are known to have survived, some fragmentary, from the age before printing. The earliest genuinely medieval recipes have been found in a Danish manuscript dating from around 1300, which in turn are copies of older texts that date back to the early 13th century or perhaps earlier.

Low and High German manuscripts are among the most numerous. Among them is &quot;Daz buch von guter spise&quot; (&quot;The Book of Good Food&quot;) written c. 1350 in Würzberg and &quot;Kuchenmeysterey&quot; (&quot;Kitchen Mastery&quot;), the first printed German cookbook from 1485. Two French collections are probably the most famous: &quot;Le Viandier&quot; (&quot;The Provisioner&quot;) was compiled in the late 14th century by Guillaume Tirel, master chef for two French kings; and &quot;Le Menagier de Paris&quot; (&quot;The Householder of Paris&quot;), a household book written by an anonymous middle class Parisian in the 1390s. Du fait de cuisine is another Medieval French cookbook, written in 1420.

From Southern Europe there is the 14th century Valencian manuscript Llibre de Sent Soví (1324), the Catalan (&quot;The book of all recipes of dishes&quot;) and several Italian collections, notably the Venetian mid-14th century &quot;Libro per Cuoco&quot;, with its 135 recipes alphabetically arranged. The printed &quot;De honesta voluptate et valetudine&quot; (&quot;On honourable pleasure&quot;), first published in 1475, is one of the first cookbooks based on Renaissance ideals, and, though it is as much a series of moral essays as a cookbook, has been described as &quot;the anthology that closed the book on medieval Italian cooking&quot;.

Medieval English cookbooks include &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; and &quot;Utilis Coquinario&quot;, both written in the fourteenth century. The Forme of Cury is a cookbook authored by the chefs of Richard II. Utilis Coquinario is a similar cookbook though written by an unknown author. Another English manuscript (1390s) includes the earliest recorded recipe for ravioli, even though ravioli did not originate in England.

===Modern cookbooks===
With the advent of the printing press in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland and England competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery had progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many of them published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have now been translated and are available online.

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. In 1796, the first known American cookbook titled, &quot;American Cookery&quot;, written by Amelia Simmons, was published in Hartford, Connecticut. Until then, the cookbooks printed and used in the Thirteen Colonies were British. The first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was Eliza Acton. Her pioneering cookbook, &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; (1845), was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was an immensely influential book, and it established the format for modern writing about cookery. The publication introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for Brussels sprouts. Contemporary chef Delia Smith is quoted as having called Acton &quot;the best writer of recipes in the English language&quot;. &quot;Modern Cookery&quot; long survived her, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile reprint.

Acton&#x27;s work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton, who published &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. The book was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and industrialism. Despite its title, most of the text consisted of recipes, such that another popular name for the volume is &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;. Most of the recipes were illustrated with coloured engravings, and it was the first book to show recipes in a format that is still used today. Many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers, including Acton.

In 1885 the &quot;Virginia Cookery Book&quot; was published by Mary Stuart Smith. In 1896 the American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) published &quot;The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot; which contained some 1,849 recipes.

==Types of cookbooks==
Cookbooks that serve as basic kitchen references (sometimes known as &quot;kitchen bibles&quot;) began to appear in the early modern period. They provided not just recipes but overall instruction for both kitchen technique and household management. Such books were written primarily for housewives and occasionally domestic servants as opposed to professional cooks, and at times books such as &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; (USA), &quot;La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange&quot; (France), &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot; (UK, USA), &quot;Il cucchiaio d&#x27;argento&quot; (Italy), and &quot;A Gift to Young Housewives&quot; (Russia) have served as references of record for national cuisines.

Cookbooks also tell stories of the writers themselves and reflect upon the era in which they are written. They often reveal notions of social, political, environmental or economic contexts. For example, during the era of industrialization, convenience foods were brought into many households and were integrated and present in cookbooks written in this time. Related to this class are instructional cookbooks, which combine recipes with in-depth, step-by-step recipes to teach beginning cooks basic concepts and techniques. In vernacular literature, people may collect traditional recipes in family cookbooks.

While western cookbooks usually group recipes for main courses by the main ingredient of the dishes, Japanese cookbooks usually group them by cooking techniques (e.g., fried foods, steamed foods, and grilled foods). Both styles of cookbook have additional recipe groupings such as soups or sweets.

===International and ethnic===

International and ethnic cookbooks fall into two categories: the kitchen references of other cultures, translated into other languages; and books translating the recipes of another culture into the languages, techniques, and ingredients of a new audience. The latter style often doubles as a sort of culinary travelogue, giving background and context to a recipe that the first type of book would assume its audience is already familiar with. Popular Puerto Rican cookbook, Cocina Criolla, written by Carmen Aboy Valldejuli, includes recipes that are typically of traditional Puerto Rican cuisine such as mofongo and pasteles. Valldejuli&#x27;s cookbook was not only important to Puerto Ricans, but also very popular in the United States where her original cookbook has since been published in several editions, including English versions. These include The Art of Caribbean Cookery - Doubleday, 1957; Puerto Rican Cookery - Pelican Publishing, 1983; and, Juntos en la Cocina (co-authored with her husband, Luis F. Valldejuli) - Pelican Publishing, 1986.

===Professional cookbooks===
Professional cookbooks are designed for the use of working chefs and culinary students and sometimes double as textbooks for culinary schools. Such books deal not only in recipes and techniques, but often service and kitchen workflow matters. Many such books deal in substantially larger quantities than home cookbooks, such as making sauces by the liter or preparing dishes for large numbers of people in a catering setting. While the most famous of such books today are books like &quot;Le guide culinaire&quot; by Escoffier or &quot;The Professional Chef&quot; by the Culinary Institute of America, such books go at least back to medieval times, represented then by works such as Taillevent&#x27;s &quot;Viandier&quot; and Chiquart d&#x27;Amiço&#x27;s &quot;Du fait de cuisine&quot;.

===Single-subject===
Single-subject books, usually dealing with a specific ingredient, technique, class of dishes or target group (e.g. for kids), are quite common as well. Jack Monroe for example features low budget recipes. Some imprints such as Chronicle Books have specialized in this sort of book, with books on dishes like curries, pizza, and simplified ethnic food. Popular subjects for narrow-subject books on technique include grilling/barbecue, baking, outdoor cooking, and even recipe cloning (Recipe cloning is copying commercial recipes where the original is a trade secret).

===Community===
Community cookbooks (also known as compiled, regional, charitable, and fund-raising cookbooks) are a unique genre of culinary literature. Community cookbooks focus on home cooking, often documenting regional, ethnic, family, and societal traditions, as well as local history. Sondra Gotlieb, for example, wrote her cookbooks on Canadian food culture by visiting people and homes by region. She gathered recipes, observed the foodways, observed the people and their traditions of each region by being in their own homes. Gotlieb did this so that she could put together a comprehensive cookbook based on the communities and individuals that make up Canada. Gooseberry Patch has been publishing community-style cookbooks since 1992 and built their brand on this community.

Community cookbooks have sometimes been created to offer a counter-narrative of historical events or sustain a community through difficult times. &quot;The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro&quot;, published in 1958 by the National Council of Negro Women, includes recipes that illuminate histories of Black resistance, including &quot;Nat Turner Crackling Bread.&quot; The 1976 &quot;People&#x27;s Philadelphia Cookbook&quot;, published by grassroots organization The People&#x27;s Fund, includes recipes from members of the Black Panther Party, The United Farm Workers, and the Gay Activist Alliance of Philadelphia. For &quot;In Memory&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, written in the 1940s by Jewish women interned at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, women drew on their memories to contribute recipes.

===Chefs===
Cookbooks can also document the food of a specific chef (particularly in conjunction with a cooking show) or restaurant. Many of these books, particularly those written by or for a well-established cook with a long-running TV show or popular restaurant, become part of extended series of books that can be released over the course of many years. Popular chef-authors throughout history include people such as Delia Smith, Julia Child, James Beard, Nigella Lawson, Edouard de Pomiane, Jeff Smith, Emeril Lagasse, Claudia Roden, Madhur Jaffrey, Katsuyo Kobayashi, and possibly even Apicius, the semi-pseudonymous author of the Roman cookbook De re coquinaria, who shared a name with at least one other famous food figure of the ancient world.

== Collections and collectors ==

Several libraries have extensive collections of cookbooks.

* Harvard&#x27;s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America has a collection of 20,000 cookbooks and other books on food, including the earliest American cookbook, and the personal collections and papers of Julia Child, M.F.K. Fisher, and the authors of &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot;.
* New York University&#x27;s Fales Library includes a Food and Cookery Collection of over 15,000 books, including the personal libraries of James Beard, Cecily Brownstone, and Dalia Carmel.
* The Brotherton Library at University of Leeds holds a Designated Cookery Collection of over 8,000 books and 75 manuscripts, including the personal collections of Blanche Leigh, John Preston and Michael Bateman.

Some individuals are notable for their collections of cookbooks, or their scholarly interest therein. Elizabeth Robins Pennell, an American critic in London from the 1880s, was an early writer on the subject, and has recently been called &quot;one of the most well-known cookbook collectors in the world&quot;. Much of her collection eventually went to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress. Held alongside hers are the thousands of gastronomic volumes donated by food chemist Katherine Bitting; their collections were evaluated in tandem in &quot;Two Loaf-Givers&quot;, by one of the LOC&#x27;s curators; a digital version is available.

==Usage outside the world of food==
The term &quot;cookbook&quot; is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to any book containing a straightforward set of already tried and tested &quot;recipes&quot; or instructions for a specific field or activity, presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results. Examples include a set of circuit designs in electronics, a book of magic spells, or &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;, a set of instructions on destruction and living outside the law. O&#x27;Reilly Media publishes a series of books about computer programming named the Cookbook series, and each of these books contain hundreds of ready to use, cut and paste examples to solve a specific problem in a single programming language.

<text>Angel food cake, or angel cake, is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites, flour, and sugar. A whipping agent, such as cream of tartar, is commonly added. It differs from other cakes because it uses no butter. Its aerated texture comes from whipped egg white. Angel food cake originated in the United States and first became popular in the late 19th century. It gained its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture and white color.

==Description==

Angel food cake requires egg whites whipped until they are stiff. Cream of tartar is added to the mixture to stabilize the egg whites. Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the egg white mixture. 

For this method of leavening to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat. Cake flour is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat cause angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.

Angel food cake should be cut with a serrated blade, as a straight-edged blade tends to compress the cake rather than slice it. Forks, electric serrated knives, special tined cutters, or a strong thread should be used instead. 

Angel food cake is usually baked in a tube pan, a tall, round pan with a tube up the centre that leaves a hole in the middle of the cake. A bundt pan may also be used, but the fluted sides can make releasing the cake more difficult. The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by &#x27;clinging&#x27; to all sides of the pan. The angel food cake pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other cakes. This allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up, helping it to rise. After baking, the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular. Recently, many chefs (Alton Brown in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to the cake.

==History==
Angel food cake is a white sponge cake made with only stiffly beaten egg whites (yolks would make it yellow and inhibit the stiffening of the whites) and no butter. The first recipe in a cookbook for a white sponge cake is in Lettice Bryan&#x27;s &quot;The Kentucky Housewife&quot; of 1839. Since there is no butter in the cake, the angel food cake is not related to the butter cakes: snow-drift cake, silver cake or lady cake.

&quot;The Home Messenger Book of Tested Recipes&quot;, 2d ed., 1878, by Isabella Stewart contained the first recipe for Angel&#x27;s Food Cake. Stewart&#x27;s detailed recipe called for eleven egg whites, sugar, flour, vanilla extract and cream of tartar.

== Uses ==

The cake is often served with berries and eaten for dessert.

The name, which comes from the texture, which is &quot;so light that angels could eat it and still fly without being weighted down&quot;, has given it a special association in some communities. Among African Americans, the cake is often served at funeral receptions, with the idea that the deceased person is now living in Heaven among the angels. Among the Pennsylvania Dutch, it is considered a wedding cake, and the couple is said to be blessed by angels.

The most traditional method, also known as the angel food cake method, is as follows. First the egg whites, and possibly salt, vanilla extract, and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed until a soft peak forms. Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard peak is formed, the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.

Different equipment is used when preparing an angel food cake at home or in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production. Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip the egg whites in a copper bowl. The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles or ovotransferrin, which is attached to copper particles, into the egg whites, improving the flexibility and stability of the foam. Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity, which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air/water.

A planetary mixer, such as a stand mixer or handheld mixer, is appropriate for a homemade or bakery cake. If the cake is being mass-produced, a continuous mixer is preferred. There are three methods in which the cake can be made at home or in a commercial setting. The first two methods are most commonly used at home or in a small bakery using planetary mixers in various sizes. Large planetary mixers may have a vacuum in order to pressurize the ingredients. This allows for control of the emulsion and temperature.

The first method is the foam process or angel food cake method. The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other ingredients are added. This method ensures that the foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that the maximum number of bubbles stay intact. 

Another method is called the meringue process. This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time. This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume. 

The last method is called the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes. Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages. A one-stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head. Upon entry into the emulsion head, air is incorporated, fully mixing the batter. In a two-stage process, the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe. The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter. The final batter may then go through a static mixer (a pipe with a spiral blade inside) to be deposited in a tube pan, depositor, or hopper.

Normally angel food cakes are baked in a straight-sided tube pan, but similar pans such as a bundt pan are acceptable. It is very important that the pan does not have a non-stick surface and that no grease is applied to the sides or around the tube. As the cake bakes, it expands and rises. The sides and hollow center tube act as supports for the foam as it expands. The hollow pan also allows for an even heat distribution.

For the optimal angel food cake outcome, experts believe that the cake should be baked for at the shortest amount of time at the highest temperature. The temperature and duration depends on the size and weight of the cake. Temperatures range from to , while baking time ranges from 30 minutes to one hour (Suas, M. 2009). If the angel food cake does not bake long enough, the foam and gel structures will not reach their full potential. In a bakery, angel food cakes could be baked in a rack oven, revolving oven, convention oven, or small deck oven. A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling oven. 

When the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area. The final volume will generally be two to three times larger than the batter volume.

Angel food cakes are cooled upside down. Some tube pans have &quot;feet&quot; or &quot;fingers&quot; that extend off of the top rim of the pan. The &quot;feet&quot; are placed on a cooling rack. If the pan does not have &quot;feet&quot; it is customary for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube to ensure that the pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.

Angel food cakes have a shelf-life of a few days at room temperature or up to a week in a refrigerator because of the tendency for moisture to migrate and evaporate. After a few days the cake will be dry and lack flexibility.

== Molecular and structural composition ==

=== Egg whites ===

Egg whites play an integral role in the structure of the baked cake. Egg whites are composed of many proteins; however, only ovalbumin, conalbumin, lysozyme, and globulins have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake. Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal to or greater than the size of the egg whites.

Egg white proteins have many uses in baking, one of which is the ability to create and maintain a foam. Whipping incorporates air throughout the egg whites, as well as denaturing or unfolding the proteins to create thinner protein molecules. Overrun, similar to lightness, describes the amount of air pushed into the foam. In terms of an angel food cake, overrun is the increase in volume from the original volume caused by the inclusion of air. The overrun of an egg white foam ranges from 500 to 800%. This means that whipping 100 mL of egg whites would result in 500–800 mL of air incorporated into the foam. During whipping, protein adsorption allows for rapid foam formation. Adsorption is the ability to spontaneously form a very thin layer on a surface. The denatured proteins move to the air/water interface to create the cell walls of the air bubbles. Cell wall formation occurs when the denatured proteins aggregate, forming an extremely thin network or film. Many interactions between the proteins and the interface are involved, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, disulfide bonds, and Van der Waals interactions. A cake made with egg yolks would not be as light and airy because they have a lower foaming ability than egg whites.

This move, to the air/water interface, by the proteins is also aided by their hydrophobic and hydrophilic part. The hydrophobic moieties orient themselves toward the air while the hydrophilic moieties orient themselves toward the water portion of the interface. The air molecules at the air/water interface interact less with the other molecules that are fully inside the bubble. This lack of interaction causes the air molecules to have excess energy, resulting in surface tension. The presence of egg white proteins at the interface acts as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension and promotes foam development. A foam is a type of emulsion: air in an aqueous solution. If the surface tension was not lowered, the air bubbles would coalescence and the emulsion would separate.

The most stable and voluminous foams are created when the egg white proteins are near their isoelectric points. Protein adsorption is most rapid at the isoelectric point because electrostatic repulsion is reduced for proteins with a neutral net charge. The viscoelasticity of protein foam films is usually at its highest near its isoelectric point. This is why acid is usually added to the cake batter, in order to adjust the pH.

The preparation of the batter should be done as quickly as possible. When the foam sits, disproportionation will occur. This is the result of water draining from the foam and collecting at the bottom. The bubbles at the top of the foam will grow larger as the water leaves and the cell walls or film become too weak and break, forming larger bubbles.

=== Whipping aids ===
Whipping aids improve the foaming properties of albumen, a protein found in egg whites, which means a firmer foam will be established in a shorter amount of time. Cream of tartar is an acidic salt which adjusts the pH of egg whites so the proteins will be more soluble, as well as reducing protein denaturation during whipping. If cream of tartar is not used the cake may not reach its maximum achievable volume. Cream of tartar also decolorizes the flavone pigments in flour, giving a final cake that is a bright white color. The whiteness of the cake is also caused by the way cream of tartar creates very small and uniform air bubbles, which gives the cake the appearance of being whiter after baking.

=== Flour ===
The baking process causes the batter to expand and go from a liquid to a solid foam. The proteins will not start to denature until the temperature reaches around . During this rise in temperature the air bubbles will either expand, coalesce, or break. An egg white foam will continue to expand uniformly until the internal temperature reaches . Based on the ideal gas law, as the temperature increases, the volume of the air bubbles will expand. The temperature will continue to rise, causing the cake to expand at different rates and egg white proteins will gradually denature. Some of the egg white proteins will start to denature and coagulate at around . This establishes the setting of the foam structure. By the time the temperature reaches , all of the egg white proteins will have set in place.

The foam structure will decrease slightly or collapse in order to form a solid foam of less volume. This occurs while the cake is still baking, not when it is cooling. The combination of protein denaturation and starch gelatinization determines whether the cake will set or collapse. When proteins denature, they are not in a stable state. In order to stabilize, the denatured proteins will aggregate around air bubbles and within the continuous phase of the batter. The aggregation and overlapping of the proteins forms a very stable network.

The flour plays an important role in the texture, structure, and elasticity of an angel food cake. Minimal folding of the flour allows cell walls to form when it comes in contact with the egg protein foam and sugar mixture. If the batter is over-mixed, the egg white proteins may coagulate causing the bubbles to break during baking, or the cell walls may become too rigid, lacking elasticity. This would reduce the volume and result in a coarse texture. However, if the batter is under-mixed, a weak foam will form.

A gluten matrix is formed when the proteins glutenin and gliadin, found in wheat flour, are mixed in the presence of water. When the batter is agitated, these two proteins form cross-links, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. The matrix that forms is strong and very flexible. Although no water is added to the batter, the gluten reacts with the water found in egg whites. Since air has already been entrapped in the foam, the flour proteins can only coat the already entrapped air. This helps to strengthen the cell walls and batter during baking or any other handling. This is beneficial because the meringue on its own is weak, cannot expand in heat, and does not have any elasticity normally expected in cakes.

Starch gelatinization occurs around the same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When starch granules are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other starch granules. About 96% of the starch granules are gelatinized. Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in a collapsed cake.

=== Sugar ===
Sugar functions as a sweetener, stabilizer, and tenderizer. The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam. When sugar and egg whites are whipped together, a meringue is formed. If the amount of sugar is less than or equal to the amount of egg whites, a soft meringue is formed. A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white. Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white. Sugar will disturb protein foam formation in a positive or negative manner. It is also important that the sugar is added slowly, so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve. It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed. This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it, causing coagulation and collapse. When the sugar dissolves, it interacts with the proteins at the air/water interface, creating a thicker and more stable cell wall. The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins, which increases overrun, giving a lighter texture. Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds, which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking.

Since there is no shortening, butter, fat, or oil, sugar is the only tenderizer. The more sugar added, the more tender the cake will be. However, if too much is added, the cake may collapse because the foam structure is not strong enough to support itself.

When the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area. This is due to Maillard browning reactions. If the cake bakes for too long, more moisture will be removed and the texture will turn out dry, rough, and potentially burnt.

==Additional ingredients in commercially produced cakes==
Commercial bakeries have a need to reduce cost and increase the shelf life for mass-produced products. For these reasons they use many ingredients that deviate from the traditional angel food cake recipe.

Dehydrated and frozen egg whites are cheaper and more efficient than fresh egg whites. However, each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants that have been used to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid. Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites. It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs. Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric. These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.

Instead of using pure cake flour, wheat flour or a mixture of wheat flour and raw wheat starch is used. The wheat flour is bleached to remove any brown pigments and produce a bright white color. The pH of the bleached flour is between 3 and 4.5, although the optimal pH of starch gelatinization is between 3.7 and 3.9. Acidifiers are used in order to reach this pH range. The optimal flour protein content is between 3% and 4%, and must be below 4.5%. If a mixture is used, at least 20% by weight should be wheat flour. A small amount of raw wheat starch may be added to the sugar as a grinding aid.

Pregelatinized starch may be added to increase the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has it would be if a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of other starches also work.

A balanced chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate, along with an acidifier is another common ingredient. When reacted together, the acidifier has the ability to release all of the carbon dioxide from the sodium bicarbonate. A variety of acidifiers can be used, including potassium bitartrate, tartaric acid, and disodium phosphate. The type of acidifier used depends on when the preferred release of CO2 is. If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting. The amount of acidifier depends on which agent, such as sodium bicarbonate, is used because they have varying neutralization points.

An excess acidifier is also added; however, it is not used in combination with the sodium bicarbonate. Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain the egg white protein foam volume in the baking cake. At a lower pH, the egg white proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking. The optimal pH for the batter is between 5.5 and 6.8. It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.

Adding a small amount of calcium chloride may be used to alter the pH to the optimum value when dehydrated egg whites with a higher pH are used. It may also alter the flour gelatinization temperature. This ensures that when large quantities of cakes are produced, the cakes will be the best possible quality and volume, without a gummy layer forming.

A whipping aid such as modified soy protein can help to account for the decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites. Modified soy protein is a soy protein in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid. Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the protein foaming abilities. Once the enzyme activity has ceased, the solution is heated to deactivate the enzyme and more hydrochloric acid is added if a pH adjustment is required.

Oxidized wheat starch is a tenderizing agent that may be added to give the angel food cake a lighter texture. Raw wheat starch is treated with sodium hypochlorite, neutralized, purified, and dried. The final starch has molecules with shorter chain lengths, which prevents the gel network from being too tough.

Unlike a homemade angel food cake, water may be used when mixing the dry ingredients, as well as to reconstitute dehydrated egg whites.

<doc id="246995" wikidata="Q264137" url="?curid=246995" title="Caroline Records">
<text>Caroline Records is a record label that was founded in 1973. Founded in the United Kingdom to showcase British progressive rock groups, the label ceased releasing titles in 1976 and then re-emerged in the United States in 1986. The label released the work of American punk rock, thrash metal and new wave music bands. Caroline had a number of subsidiary labels, including Astralwerks, Gyroscope, Caroline Blue Plate, Beat the World, Scamp and Passenger. In 2013, the brand was relaunched by Universal Music via the Capitol Music Group.

==UK label==
The original Caroline record label started as a subsidiary of Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Records from 1973 to 1976. It specialized in inexpensive LPs by progressive rock and jazz artists that lacked commercial appeal. Caroline Records rarely mentioned a connection with Virgin, and some UK and European Virgin albums that were distributed internationally (instead of being manufactured in each country) named Caroline as their American distributor.

The first release was &quot;Outside the Dream Syndicate&quot; by Tony Conrad and Faust in 1973. The logo was a photographic-style variation of Virgin&#x27;s &quot;Twins&quot; logo, designed by Roger Dean.

==US label==
In 1983, the Caroline name was reused by Virgin in the US as the importer Caroline Distribution. Caroline Distribution founded the current Caroline Records in 1986. Some Caroline Records CDs issued in the US, bore the label name Caroline Blue Plate, especially Virgin UK originally-issued progressive rock records. Caroline Records was merged into Virgin Records after Virgin was acquired by Thorn EMI. Caroline Distribution was separated and became part of EMI Music Distribution. In 2013, the brand was revived by Universal Music Group under Capitol Music Group.

==France label==
Caroline France was created in 2014 by Thomas Lorain following a call from Caroline who wanted a subsidiary in France.

Caroline France renamed itself Virgin Records France in 2021 following the launch of Virgin Music Label &amp; Artist Services.

==Primo Scree==
Primo Scree was an imprint of Caroline Records created by Ned Hayden of the Action Swingers, who had previously been a sales rep at Caroline. Its releases included the Action Swingers&#x27; single &quot;Fear of a Fucked Up Planet&quot;, as well as Gumball&#x27;s debut album &quot;Special Kiss&quot; and Monster Magnet&#x27;s debut album &quot;Spine of God&quot;.

<text>The national flag of [[the Philippines]] () is a horizontal bicolor flag with equal bands of royal blue and crimson red, with a white, equilateral chevron at the hoist. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, to represent the original eight provinces that rebelled against the Spanish during the 1896 Philippine Revolution. At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed, golden-yellow star, each of which representing one of the country&#x27;s three main island groups—Luzon, Visayas (though originally referring to the island of Panay), and Mindanao. The white triangle at the hoist represents liberty, equality, and fraternity. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.

== Design ==
=== Construction ===
The flag&#x27;s length is twice its width, giving it an aspect ratio of 1:2. The length of all the sides of the white triangle are equal to the width of the flag. Each star is oriented in such manner that one of its tips points towards the vertex at which it is located. Moreover, the gap-angle between two neighbors of the 8 ray-bundles is as large as the angle of one ray-bundle (so 22.5°), with each major ray having double the thickness of its two minor rays. The golden sun is not exactly in the center of the triangle but shifted slightly to the right.

=== Color ===

The shade of blue used in the flag has varied over time, beginning with the original color described as &quot;azul oscuro&quot; (Spanish, &quot;dark blue&quot;). The exact nature of this shade is debated, but a likely candidate is the blue on which a theory says influenced the Philippine flag&#x27;s design. The colors of the flag were first standardized by President Ramón Magsaysay, upon the recommendation of the Philippine Historical Committee (PHC) dated January 24, 1955. Specifically, the colors adopted were Old Glory Red (Cable No. 70180), National Flag Blue (Cable No. 70077), Spanish Yellow (Cable No. 70068), and White (70001) by the Reference Guide of the Textile Color Card Association of the United States. In 1985, President Ferdinand E. Marcos through Executive Order No. 1010, s. 1985 instructed the National Historical Institute &quot;to take the necessary steps to restore the original color of the First Philippine Flag&quot;. In late May, the NHI adopted Oriental Blue (Cable No. 80176) for the new national flag, but this was later rescinded by President Corazon C. Aquino after the 1986 People Power Revolution that removed him from power in favor of pre-1985 National Flag Blue. For the 1998 centennial celebration of Philippine independence, the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines (Republic Act. 8491, s. 1998) was passed, designating Royal Blue (Cable No. 80173) as the official variant to be used from 1998 to present.

The flag&#x27;s colors are specified and codified under Republic Act 8491, s. 1998 signed on February 12, 1998, in terms of their cable number in the system developed by the Color Association of the United States. The official colors and their approximations in other color spaces are listed below:

=== Symbolism ===


In the late 19th century, both Manila and Iloilo, the archipelago&#x27;s largest ports, each had maritime flags used for navigation in the Philippine seas. Both maritime flags were swallowtail flags with red and blue stripes, respectively, which were later adopted in the Philippine flag. The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty, equality and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace, truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism and valor. In the center of the white triangle is an eight-rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people&#x27;s democracy, and sovereignty. Each ray represents a province or district with significant involvement in the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain; these are the provinces Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Laguna, Batangas, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija (some sources specify other provinces as alternatives to some of these) and the district of Morong (modern-day province of Rizal). However, according to the Declaration of Independence and a research by Ateneo de Manila University Professor Ambeth Ocampo, the rays of the sun symbolized the first eight provinces of the Philippines which was declared under martial law during the Philippine Revolution (Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Manila, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac). Three five-pointed stars, one at each of the triangle&#x27;s points, stand for the three major island groups: Luzon, Visayas (originally referring to Panay Island) and Mindanao.

The flag&#x27;s original symbolism is enumerated in the text of the independence proclamation, which makes reference to an attached drawing, though no record of the drawing has surfaced. The proclamation explains the flag as follows:
The symbolism given in the 1898 Proclamation of Philippine Independence differs from the current official explanation. According to the document, the white triangle signifies the emblem of the Katipunan, the secret society that opposed Spanish rule. It says the flag&#x27;s colors commemorate the flag of the United States as a manifestation of gratitude for American aid against the Spanish during the Philippine Revolution. It also says that one of the three stars represents the island of Panay, which recent historical interpretations say was &quot;representative of the entire Visayas region&quot;.

== History ==
=== Historical flags of the Philippine Revolution ===
It has been common since the 1960s to trace the development of the Philippine flag to the various war standards of the individual leaders of the Katipunan, a pseudo-masonic revolutionary movement that opposed Spanish rule in the Philippines and led the Philippine Revolution. However, while some symbols common to the Katipunan flags would be adopted into the iconography of the Revolution, it is inconclusive whether these war standards can be considered precursors to the present Philippine flag.

The first flag of the Katipunan was a red rectangular flag with a horizontal alignment of three white Ks (an acronym for the Katipunan&#x27;s full name, &quot;Kataas-taasang Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan&quot; – Supreme and Venerable Society of the Sons of the Nation). The flag&#x27;s red field symbolized blood, as members of the Katipunan signed their membership papers in their own blood.

The various leaders of the Katipunan, such as Andrés Bonifacio, Mariano Llanera, and Pío del Pilar, also had individual war standards.

=== Current flag ===

The Philippine national flag was designed by Emilio Aguinaldo. It was sewn by Doña Marcela Mariño Agoncillo, her five-year-old daughter Lorenza Mariño Agoncillo, and Mrs. Delfina Herbosa Natividad, Dr.José Rizal&#x27;s niece by his sister Lucia. It was first displayed in the Battle of Alapan on May 28, 1898, after the Spaniards were defeated and surrendered to Aguinaldo. A &quot;Manila Times&quot; article by Augusto de Viana, Chief History Researcher, National Historical Institute, mentions assertions in history textbooks and commemorative rites that the flag was first raised in Alapan, Imus, Cavite, on May 28, 1898, citing Presidential Proclamation No. 374, issued by President Diosdado Macapagal on March 6, 1965. The article goes on to claim that historical records indicate that the first display of the Philippine flag took place in Cavite City, when General Aguinaldo displayed it during the first fight of the Philippine Revolution.

The flag was formally unfurled during the proclamation of independence on June 12, 1898, in Aguinaldo&#x27;s Residence at Kawit, Cavite.

 The original design of the flag adopted a mythical sun (Sun of May) with a face influenced by The Republics of the Rio de la Plata, Argentina and Uruguay, which in turn represent Inti the Incan Sun-god; a triangle, representing the Katipunan which inspired by the Eye of Providence in the Great Seal of the United States and the Masonic Triangle and which enshrined &quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité&quot; of the French Revolution; the stripes and colors derived from the American flag. The particular shade of blue of the original flag has been a source of controversy. Based on anecdotal evidence and the few surviving flags from the era, historians argue that the colors of the original flag was influenced by the flags of Cuba and Puerto Rico.

During the session of the Malolos Congress, Aguinaldo presented the symbolism of the official flag to the members, delegates and representatives of the assembly as follows:

The original flag that was first hoisted on May 28, 1898, and unfurled during the Declaration of independence on June 12, 1898, is believed to being preserved at the Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo Museum in Baguio. There were plans to restore the flag by replacing the worn-out portion but the idea was abandoned because matching threads could not be found. The flag is more elaborate than the flag which is currently in use. It bears the embroidered words, &quot;Libertad, Justicia and Igualdad&quot; (Liberty, Justice, and Equality) on one side of the flag and &quot;Fuerzas Expedicionarias del Norte de Luzon&quot; (Expeditionary forces of Northern Luzon) on the other. In a 2012 essay, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines acknowledged that the flag kept in Baguio as authentic and a contemporary of the original flag. However, the essay concluded that it could not be one being unfurled during the independence declaration in Kawit because it is made of mix silk and cotton farbic. According to Agoncillo&#x27;s statement in Philippine Herald in 1929, the flag she sewn was made in fine silk.

Hostilities broke out between the Philippines and the United States in 1899. The flag was first flown with the red field up on February 4, 1899, to show that a state of war existed. Aguinaldo was captured by the Americans two years later, and swore allegiance to the United States.

With the defeat of the Philippine Republic, the Philippines was placed under American occupation and the display of the Philippine flag and other flags and banners associated with the Katipunan were declared illegal by the Flag Act of 1907. This law was repealed on October 24, 1919. With the legalization of display of the Philippine flag, the cloth available in most stores was the red and blue of the flag of the United States, so the flag from 1919 onwards adopted the &quot;National Flag blue&quot; color. On March 26, 1920, the Philippine Legislature passed Act. No 2928 on March 26, 1920, which legally adopted the Philippine flag as the official flag of the Philippine Islands. Up until the eve of World War II, Flag Day was celebrated on annually on October 30, commemorating the date the ban on the flag was lifted.

The Commonwealth of the Philippines was inaugurated in 1935. On March 25, 1936, President Manuel L. Quezon issued Executive Order No. 23 which provided for the technical description and specifications of the flag. Among the provisions of the order was the definition of the triangle at the hoist as an equilateral triangle, the definition of the aspect ratio at 1:2, the precise angles of the stars, the geometric and aesthetic design of the sun, and the formal elimination of the mythical face on the sun. The exact shades of colors, however, were not precisely defined. These specifications have remained unchanged and in effect to the present. In 1941, Flag Day was officially moved to June 12, commemorating the date that Philippine independence was proclaimed in 1898.

The flag was once again banned with the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Philippines beginning in December 1941, to be hoisted again with the establishment of the Second Republic of the Philippines, a puppet state of Japan. In ceremonies held in October 1943, Emilio Aguinaldo hoisted the flag with the original Cuban blue and red colors restored. The flag was initially flown with the blue stripe up, until President José P. Laurel proclaimed the existence of a state of war with the Allied Powers in 1944. The Commonwealth government-in-exile in Washington, D.C. continued to use the flag with the American colors, and had flown it with the red stripe up since the initial invasion of the Japanese. With the combined forces of the Filipino and American soldiers and the liberation of the Philippines in 1944 to 1945, the flag with the American colors was restored, and it was this flag that was hoisted upon the granting of Philippine independence from the United States on July 4, 1946.

== Chronology ==

==Proposals==
===Ninth ray for the flag&#x27;s sun===
Proposals to add a ninth ray to the sun of the Philippine flag dates as early as 1969, when the Ninth Ray historical reform movement started at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. The symbolism of the ninth ray varies by proponent.

====As representative of a ninth province====
Prior to the 1998 independence centennial celebrations, the provincial government of Zambales lobbied that the sunburst design accommodate a ninth ray, reasoning that their province was also in a state of rebellion in 1896. The Centennial Commission however refuted this change, based on research by the National Historical Institute. In August 2003, then Foreign Affairs Secretary Blas Ople also lobbied for a ninth ray, saying that Quezon should be added. He reasons that the first uprising against the Spaniards happened at the foot of Mount Banahaw which was led by Hermano Pule in 1841.

====As representative of an ethnic group====
In December 1987, congressman Alawadin Bandon Jr. of Tawi-Tawi proposed the addition of a ninth ray to the Philippine flag&#x27;s sun to represent &quot;Muslim participation&quot; in the Philippine Revolution, arguing that &quot;As a Muslim I am assaulted by a feeling of alienation in being excluded from the symbolic narration of the great history of the country.&quot; Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. later expressed the same view, filing a Senate Bill seeking the addition of a ninth ray representing Filipino Muslims in March 1988.

In 2008, Senator Richard Gordon filed Senate Bill No. 2590 which aimed to amend the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines. This measure was later superseded by Senate Bill No. 3307 which was sponsored by Senator Francis Escudero and approved in September 2009. The bill was sent to the House of Representatives for concurrence with House Bill 6424. Both S.B. No. 3307 and H.B. 6424 was reconciled by the Bicameral Conference Committee in September 2009. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, however, vetoed the measure.

, a proposal from the Ninth Ray movement intends the additional ray to represent the Muslim and indigenous people of the country, including the Moro people, who kept colonizers away from their lands.

In June 2018, Gordon renewed his campaign to get his proposal passed into law.

===Fourth star===
Emmanuel L. Osorio, one of the founders of the Ninth Ray movement, also came up with a proposal adding not only a ninth ray to the flag&#x27;s sun but adding a fourth star to the flag, representing North Borneo (present-day Sabah), a territory claimed by the Philippines but currently under Malaysian sovereignty. The flag&#x27;s triangle is changed into a rectangle to accommodate the fourth star. According to Osorio, the star representing Sabah in his proposed flag was added &quot;in principle&quot; and said the flag proposal seeks to express the Ninth Ray movement&#x27;s view that &quot;if we get Sabah, then it could be represented by the star&quot;.

===Crescent moon===
There was a proposal to add a crescent moon during the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos in a lead up to the 1998 Philippine Centennial. Ramos directed Education Secretary Ricardo Gloria in 1995 to form a commission of scholars to research on the possible modification of the flag. The crescent is meant to represent the Moro community.

==Usage==

===Display===

The flag should be displayed in all government buildings, official residences, public plazas, and schools every day throughout the year. All other places as may be designated by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines as such. The days of May 28 (National Flag Day) and June 12 (Independence Day) are designated as flag days, during which all offices, agencies and instrumentalities of government, business establishments, institutions of learning and private homes are enjoined to display the flag. But in recent years, the flag days are now from May 28 to June 30 yearly to promote patriotism and to celebrate the nation&#x27;s independence. Display of the Philippine flag by the public, on their properties, during sporting matches, etc., is legal and not unheard of even at other times of year.

The display of the Philippine flag in cockpit arenas, casinos, disco venues, night and day clubs, gambling joints, houses of prostitution, methamphetamine consumption areas, strip clubs, rub&#x27;n&#x27;tug s, methadone clinics, and &quot;places of vice or where frivolity prevails&quot; is illegal.

When displaying the Philippine flag with another flag in a crossed position, the former should hang on the left side of the observer and its staff should be displayed over the staff of the second flag. The display of two crossed Philippine flags is not permissible. In the case of the Philippine flag&#x27;s display on a stage or platform such as in a speech, the flag&#x27;s staff should be positioned on the right side and in front of the speaker and all other secondary flags displayed on the speaker&#x27;s left.

====Permanent display====
=====Original named sites=====
By law, the Philippine flag must be permanently hoisted and illuminated at night at the following locations:

=====Additional sites=====
The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (formerly the National Historical Institute) as per Republic Act No. 8491 can also designate additional sites where the Philippine flag should be displayed permanently.

====Half-mast====

The flag may be flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. Upon the official announcement of the death of the president or a former president, the flag should be flown at half-mast for ten days. The flag should be flown at half-mast for seven days following the death of the vice president, the chief justice, the president of the Senate or the speaker of the House of Representatives.

The flag may also be required to fly at half-mast upon the death of other persons to be determined by the National Historical Institute, for a period less than seven days. The flag shall be flown at half-mast on all the buildings and places where the decedent was holding office, on the day of death until the day of interment of an incumbent member of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, the Senate or the House of Representatives, and such other persons as may be determined by the National Historical Commission.

When flown at half-mast, the flag should be first hoisted to the peak for a moment then lowered to the half-mast position. It should be raised to the peak again before it is lowered for the day.

A bill was filed in 2014, to mandate the flying of the flag at half-mast as a tribute to public school teachers. Under the proposal the flag shall be flown at half-mast for at least five days at the school or district office the deceased teacher was assigned.

====In wakes and burials====
The flag may also be used to cover the caskets of deceased public officials or employees such as tanod, military and police, civil uniformed services, fire fighter, senator, congress, traffic enforcer, cadets for military or police, justices ranging from lower courts to supreme court, Filipino governance servants, veterans of previous wars veteran soldiers, national artists, uniformed rescuers, PNP SWAT and outstanding civilians as determined by the local government. In such cases, the flag must be placed such that the white triangle is at the head and the blue portion covers the right side of the casket. The flag should not be lowered to the grave or allowed to touch the ground, but should be solemnly folded and handed to the heirs of the deceased.

There is a common practice of placing religious items on top of the Philippine flag when draped on a coffin such as a rosary, bible, torah, Quran, Christian cross (be it crucifix or empty cross), Islamic star and moon, or the star of David. This is allowed by law to symbolize the belief and principle of &quot;God above country&quot; as well as to uphold the constitution&#x27;s guarantee of religious freedom.

====As a war ensign====

The Philippines does not utilize a separate war flag; instead, the national flag itself is used for this purpose. To indicate a state of war, the red field is flown upwards and is placed on the right (i.e., the observer&#x27;s left) when hung vertically. In times of peace, however, the blue area is the superior field. On this case, the Philippine flag is the only official country flag in the world that can be flipped when the country is at war. The red side-up orientation of the flag was used by the First Philippine Republic during the Philippine–American War from 1899 to 1901, by the Philippine Commonwealth during World War II from 1941 to 1945, by the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic when it declared war against the United Kingdom and the United States in 1944, by soldiers and civilians during the attempted coups d&#x27;états against President Corazon Aquino&#x27;s administration, and by militants and rallyists during EDSA III.

===Subdivision insignia===

The usage of the Philippine flag as an element of a local government unit&#x27;s (LGU; provinces, cities, and municipalities) seal is discouraged as per Memorandum Circular 92-30 of the Department of the Interior and Local Government. The usage of the flag is permissible if the flag itself has been part of the LGU&#x27;s history such as in the case of Kawit, Cavite, which is the site of the declaration of Philippine independence.

===In intellectual property===
The Philippine flag itself is not eligible to be trademarked according to the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHIL) since the flag is &quot;owned by the public&quot; in line with prohibitions on the flag&#x27;s usage stated in Republic Act 8491. The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, which the Philippines is a member of, also prohibits the registration of the state flags of its members as trademark. However both small and large businesses in the Philippines have used elements of the Philippine flag for their intellectual property. When it comes to this concern, the IPOPHIL has allowed businesses to use elements of the flag to invoke the national symbol as long as the intellectual property is neither a &quot;true representation&quot; of the Philippine flag nor a &quot;modification that would amount to defacement of the flag&quot;.

===Prohibited acts===

According to Republic Act 8491 itself, it shall be prohibited:
:a) To mutilate, deface, defile, trample on or cast contempt or commit any act or omission casting dishonor or ridicule upon the flag or over its surface;
:b) To dip the flag to any person or object by way of compliment or salute;
:c) To use the flag:
::1) As a drapery, festoon, tablecloth;
::2) As covering for ceilings, walls, statues or other objects;
::3) As a pennant in the hood, side, back and top of motor vehicles;
::4) As a staff or whip;
::5) For unveiling monuments or statues; and
::6) As trademarks, or for industrial, commercial or agricultural labels or designs.
:d) To display the flag:
::1) Under any painting or picture;
::2) Horizontally face-up. It shall always be hoisted aloft and be allowed to fall freely;
::3) Below any platform; or
::4) In discothèques, cockpits, night and day clubs, casinos, gambling joints and places of vice or where frivolity prevails.
:e) To wear the flag in whole or in part as a costume or uniform;
:f) To add any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawings, advertisement, or imprint of any nature on the flag;
:g) To print, paint or attach representation of the flag on handkerchiefs, napkins, cushions, and other articles of merchandise;
:h) To display in public any foreign flag, except in embassies and other diplomatic establishments, and in offices of international organizations;
:i) To use, display or be part of any advertisement or infomercial; and
:j) To display the flag in front of buildings or offices occupied by aliens.

The Act mandates that violators shall, upon conviction, be punished by fine or imprisonment.

==Relevant customs==
===Pledge===

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine flag (distinct from the Patriotic Oath of Allegiance) should be recited while standing with the right hand with palm open raised shoulder high. Individuals whose faith or religious beliefs prohibit them from making such pledge as well as singing the national anthem are permitted to excuse themselves, but are required by law to show full respect when the pledge is being rendered by standing at attention.

The law makes no statement regarding the language in which the pledge must be recited, but the pledge is written (and therefore recited) in the Filipino language.

===Flag anthem===

Spanish, Tagalog and English versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current &quot;Filipino&quot; version is officially recognized by law. The Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on February 12, 1998, specifies, &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot;, &quot;The National Anthem shall always be sung in the national language within or without the country&quot;; violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.

===National Flag Day===
The National Flag Day in the Philippines is celebrated every May 28, the very day of the 1898 Battle of Alapan. The official national flag flying period starts from May 28 and ends on Independence Day, June 12, every year, although the flying period for the flag in homes, businesses and public establishments may start on a specified day of May (to be given by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and may last until June 30.

<text>Civil service examinations are examinations implemented in various countries for recruitment and admission to the civil service. They are intended as a method to achieve an effective, rational public administration on a merit system for recruiting prospective politicians and public sector employees.

The most ancient example of such exams were the imperial examinations of ancient China.

== Competitive exam ==
Competitive examinations are tests where candidates are ranked according to their grades and/or percentile and then top rankers are selected. If the examination is open for &quot;n&quot; positions, then the first &quot;n&quot; candidates in ranks pass, the others are rejected. They are used as entrance examinations for university and college admissions such as the Joint Entrance Examination or to secondary schools. Types are civil service examinations, required for positions in the public sector; the U.S. Foreign Service Exam, and the United Nations Competitive Examination. Competitive examinations are considered an egalitarian way to select worthy applicants without risking influence peddling, bias or other concerns.

<doc id="247002" wikidata="Q21838" url="?curid=247002" title="Proteales">
<text>Proteales is an order of flowering plants consisting of three (or four) families. The Proteales have been recognized by almost all taxonomists.

The representatives of the Proteales are very different from each other due to their very early divergence. They possess seeds with little or no endosperm. The ovules are often atropic.

The oldest fossils of Proteales are of the nelumbonaceous genus &quot;Notocyamus&quot; from the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous of Brazil, 126–121 Ma (million years ago). According to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Proteales split from other plants about 128 Ma or 125 Ma.

==Families==
Within the classification system of Rolf Dahlgren, the Proteales were in the superorder Proteiflorae, also called Proteanae; The APG II system (of 2003) also recognizes this order, placing it in the clade Eudicots, with the following circumscription:

* order Proteales
:* family Nelumbonaceae
:* family Proteaceae [+ family Platanaceae]

with &quot;+ ...&quot; = optionally separate family (that may be split off from the preceding family).

The APG III system of 2009 followed this same approach, but favored the narrower circumscription of the three families, firmly recognizing three families in Proteales: Nelumbonaceae, Platanaceae, and Proteaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, however, suggests the addition of Sabiaceae, which the APG III system did not place in any order in the eudicots, would be sensible.

The APG IV system of 2016 added family Sabiaceae to the order.

Well-known members of the Proteales include the proteas of South Africa, the banksia and macadamia of Australia, the planetree, and the sacred lotus. The origins of the order are clearly ancient, with evidence of diversification in the mid-Cretaceous, roughly over 100 million years ago. Of notable interest is the family&#x27;s modern distribution; the Proteaceae is predominantly a Southern Hemisphere family, while the Platanaceae and Nelumbonaceae are Northern Hemisphere plants.

==Classification==
The current APG IV classification represents a slight change from the APG I system of 1998, which firmly did accept family Platanaceae as being separate from the order. Under APG IV, this is the current circumscription of the order: 
* order Proteales
:* family Nelumbonaceae
:* family Platanaceae
:* family Proteaceae
:* family Sabiaceae

===Cronquist===
The Cronquist system of 1981 recognized such an order and placed it in subclass Rosidae in class Magnoliopsida [=dicotyledons]. It used this circumscription:
* order Proteales
:* family Elaeagnaceae
:* family Proteaceae

===Dahlgren; Thorne; Engler; and Wettstein===
The Dahlgren system and Thorne system (1992) recognized such an order and placed it in superorder Proteanae in subclass Magnoliidae [=dicotyledons]. The Engler system, in its update of 1964, also recognized this order and placed it in subclass Archichlamydeae of class Dicotyledoneae. The Wettstein system, last revised in 1935, recognized this order and placed it in the Monochlamydeae in subclass Choripetalae of class Dicotyledones. These systems used the following circumscription:
* order Proteales
:* family Proteaceae

<doc id="247003" wikidata="Q1062135" url="?curid=247003" title="Business jet">
<text>A business jet, private jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small groups of people, typically business executives and high-ranking associates. Business jets are generally designed for faster air travel and more personal comfort than commercial aircraft, and may be adapted for other roles, such as casualty evacuation or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, government officials, VIPs, or even the military.

== History ==
===Early developments===
The first small, jet-powered civilian aircraft was the Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris, developed privately in the early 1950s from the MS.755 Fleuret two-seat jet trainer. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, similar to a light aircraft, under a large sliding canopy similar to that of a fighter. A U.S. type certificate was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civilian version similar to a modern very light jet, with a six-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage. The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by Cessna and Douglas Aircraft to market similar jets.

The development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 United States Air Force (USAF) letter of the requirement for two &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; aircraft, the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard USAF procurement contracts in that no formal competitions would occur, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. Both Lockheed Corporation and McDonnell Aircraft began the development of UCX aircraft, while North American Aviation pursued the UTX requirement.

=== 1950s first flight ===
The Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris had a gross weight of , initially powered by two Turboméca Marboré turbojets of thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to units. The aircraft seated a single pilot and up to three passengers under a sliding canopy, and was first flown on 29 July 1954; 219 were built.

The Lockheed JetStar, designed to meet USAF UCX requirements and seating 10 passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. In total, 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12 turbojets, then Garrett TFE731 turbofans for a maximum take-off weight (MTOW), then two General Electric CF700 turbofans.

The smaller, MTOW North American Sabreliner, tailored to the USAF UTX requirement, first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12 turbojet engines then Garrett TFE731s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.

Designed in 1957 for the UCX requirement, the McDonnell 119 was delayed by the cancellation of the Fairchild J83 engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four Westinghouse J34 turbojets. The 119 was certified for a MTOW with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.

=== 1960s first flight ===

The MTOW British Aerospace 125 first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW300 turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the Hawker 800, were produced between 1962 and 2013.

The Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the IAI Westwind, first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two General Electric CJ610 turbojets, then Garrett TFE731s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft, and it was developed as the IAI Astra, later rebranded as the Gulfstream G100.

The MTOW Dassault Falcon 20 first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two General Electric CF700s, then Garrett ATF3 turbofans and Garrett TFE731s. In total, 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the Dassault Falcon family.

The first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 - the Learjet 23. Powered by two General Electric CJ610s, its MTOW complies with FAR Part 23 regulations. The first member of the Learjet family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.

The forward wing-sweep, MTOW Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.
The joint Piaggo-Douglas, MTOW Piaggio PD.808 first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two Armstrong Siddeley Vipers; 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.

On 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the MTOW Grumman Gulfstream II, powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans. From 1967 to the late &#x27;70s, 258 were built, and it led to the ongoing Gulfstream Aerospace long-range family.

The MTOW Cessna Citation I first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985, for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the Cessna Citation family.

=== 1970s first flight ===

The trijet Dassault Falcon 50 made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The MTOW airplane is powered by three TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger Falcon 900.

On 8 November 1978, the prototype Canadair Challenger took off. The MTOW craft, usually powered by two General Electric CF34s, formed the basis of the long range Bombardier Global Express family and of the Bombardier CRJ regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.

On 30 May 1979 the all-new MTOW Cessna Citation III took off for the first time, powered by two TFE731s.

The Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The MTOW jet was powered by two JT15D. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then Hawker 400, with a total of 950 produced of all variants.

=== 1980s first flight ===

The 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. The late 1980s saw the advent of fractional ownership for business jets. For much of the 1980s, sales of new aircraft slumped.

=== 1990s first flight ===

On 29 April 1991, the Cessna CitationJet was first flown. Powered by two Williams FJ44 engines, the light jet used a modified Citation II fuselage with a new wing and tail, and was subsequently developed into the CJ series and M2, ultimately replacing the Citation I, Citation II and Citation V series. The 2,000th CitationJet was delivered in 2017.

The first flight of the all-new Learjet 45 was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two TFE731 engines.

Powered by two Williams FJ44s, the Beechcraft Premier I light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.

=== 2000s first flight ===

In the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the Legacy 600 from the Embraer ERJ family of regional jet airliners. Powered by two Rolls-Royce AE 3007s, the first flight of the aircraft was on 31 March 2001.

On 14 August 2001, the Bombardier Challenger 300 made its first flight. The aircraft is powered by two HTF7000s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.

The first very light jet, the MTOW Eclipse 500, took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW600s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.

Another new small jet, the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, first flew on 3 December 2003 powered by two GE Honda HF120 engines mounted above the wing in a configuration unique amongst business jets. As of March 2020, 150 had been delivered.

It was followed by the MTOW Cessna Citation Mustang on 23 April 2005, powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.

Then the Embraer Phenom 100 made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The MTOW airplane is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW600s. With its Phenom 300 development, nearly 600 have been built.

=== 2010s first flight ===

The first flight of the midsize, fly-by-wire, Honeywell HTF7000-powered Embraer Legacy 500 was on 27 November 2012. It was followed by the shorter Legacy 450 on 28 December 2013.

=== New models ===

After peaking in 2008, deliveries slowed due to political instability but the industry hopes to revive demand by introducing more attractive and competitive new models, four in 2018:
* the range Bombardier Global 7500 large-cabin jet, before the Global 8000 in 2019;
* the large-cabin Gulfstream G500, replacing the Gulfstream G450, then the longer, G600 eventually superseding the G550;
* the Cessna Citation Longitude super midsize jet;
* the superlight Pilatus PC-24.

In October 2018, consultant Jetcraft expected 20 variants or new designs to enter service before 2023 (seven large, seven midsize and six small):
in 2019 the Global 5500/6500, Gulfstream G600, Citation XLS++ and a CitationJet CJ4+/, while the Embraer Praetor 500/600 to be introduced in 2019 were predicted for 2021/2022;
in 2020 a Gulfstream G750;
in 2021 the Dassault Falcon 6X, Learjet 70XR/75XR and Global 7500XR;
in 2022 the Bombardier Challenger 350XRS;
in 2023 the Citation Hemisphere, an Embraer Legacy 700, Phenom 100V+, Dassault Falcon 9X, Bombardier Challenger 750 and Gulfstream G400NG;
in 2025 a Citation Mustang 2+.

== Configuration ==

Most production business jets use two jet engines as a compromise between the operating economy of fewer engines and the ability to safely continue flight after an engine failure. Exceptions include the early Lockheed Jetstar with four engines; the Dassault Falcon 50 and derivatives with three; and the Cirrus Vision SF50 with one, a configuration also used in several similar very light jet design concepts. Most business jets use podded engines mounted on the rear fuselage with a cruciform tail or T-tail to reduce interference drag and increase exhaust clearance. Practical limits on the ground clearance of these smaller aircraft have prompted designers to avoid the common jetliner configuration of a low wing with underslung podded engines. The sole business jet to use this layout, the early McDonnell 119, was rejected by the USAF due to foreign object damage concerns, leading to the failure of the program. The recent HondaJet uses wing-mounted engines but mitigates this problem with its unique over-the-wing engine pods.

As with jetliners, swept wings are often used to increase cruise speed, but straight wings are also commonplace; notably, Cessna deliberately prioritized docile low-speed handling in choosing straight wings for many models in its popular Citation family, envisioning that owners transitioning from slower piston engined or turboprop aircraft would want to maintain the ability to use relatively short runways, and that lower approach speeds would ease single-pilot operations, particularly by relatively inexperienced owner-pilots.

Rolls-Royce plc powers over 3,000 business jets, 42% of the fleet: all the Gulfstreams and Bombardier Globals, the Cessna Citation X and Embraer Legacy 600, early Hawkers, and many small jets with the Williams-Rolls FJ44.

== Market ==
===Fleet===

About 70% of the fleet was in North America at the end of 2011, the European market is the next largest, with growing activity in the Middle East, Asia, and Central America.

On 1 April 2017, there were 22,368 business jets in the worldwide fleet, of which 11.2% were for sale.

By October 2018, the entire private jet fleet was dominated by Textron (Beechcraft, Cessna and Hawker branded aircraft) with 43.9%, then Bombardier with 22.4%, Gulfstream with 13.0%, Dassault with 9.6% and Embraer with 5.8%, mostly in North America (64.6%), followed by Europe (13.0%) South America (12.1%) and Asia-Pacific (5.9%).

As on March 31, 2019, there are 22,125 business jets in the worldwide fleet and top 20 country markets account for 89% of this total fleet.

===Market shares===

In 2015 the total airplane billing amounted to US$21.9 billion, and 718 business jets were delivered to customers across the globe: 199 (%) by Bombardier Aerospace, 166 (%) by Textron Aviation, 154 (%) by Gulfstream Aerospace, 120 (%) by Embraer and 55 (%) by Dassault Aviation.

In 2017, 676 business jets were shipped, led by Gulfstream with $6.56 billion for 120 aircraft, Bombardier with $5.2 billion for 140, Textron with $2.87 billion (including propeller aircraft and 180 jets), Dassault with $2.42 billion for 49 and Embraer with $1.35 billion for 109.

In 2022, 712 business jets were shipped, led by Gulfstream with $6.60 billion for 120 aircraft, Bombardier with $6,04 billion for 123, Textron Aviation with $3,62 billion, Dassault Aviation with $1,76 billion for 32, Embraer with $1,36 for 102 and Pilatus with $900 million for 123 aircraft.


===Second hand===

The residual value level for a five-year old aircraft is at 56% of the list price.
A new business aircraft typically depreciates by 50% in five years before depreciation flattens between years 10 and 15, and the owner of a 15-to-20 year old aircraft is often the last, matching luxury cars.

Business jets have varying value retention, between the leading Embraer Phenom 300E, sold for $9.45 million in 2018 and expected to retain 68% of its value 15 years later for $6.46 million in 2033, and the trailing $24.5 million Gulfstream G280, predicted to retain 42% of its value for $10.25 million.

===Forecasts===

In October 2017 Jetcraft forecast 8,349 unit deliveries in the next decade for $252 billion, a $M average. Cessna should lead the numbers with 27.3% of the deliveries ahead of Bombardier with 20.9%, while Gulfstream would almost lead the revenue market share with 27.8% trailing Bombardier with 29.2%.
For 2016–2025, Jetcraft forecast Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada should be the first engine supplier with 30% of the $24B revenue, in front of the current leader Rolls-Royce at 25%. Honeywell will hold 45% of the $16B in avionics revenue ahead of Rockwell Collins with 37% and Garmin.

For 2019–2028, Honeywell predicts 7,700 aircraft to be delivered for $251 billion. Its breakdown is 62% big (87% in value) – super-midsize to business liner, 10% midsize (7% in value) – light-medium to medium, and 28% small (6% in value). The global demand is expected to come from North America for 61%, 16% from Europe, 12% from Latin America, 7% from Asia-Pacific and 4% from Middle East and Africa.

For the next decade, &quot;Aviation Week&quot; predicts 8,683 business jets and 2,877 turboprops deliveries, from 792 jets in 2019 to 917 in 2028, and mostly in North America with 5,986 jets and 2,024 turboprops worth $126.1 billion.
Most value will come from ultra-long-range jets with $104.7 billion, followed by super-midsize jets for $33.3 billion and large jets for $30.6 billion.
The fleet was predicted to grow from 31,300 aircraft to nearly 35,600 with Textron leading the market with 25% of deliveries worth $32.1 billion.
For the decade starting in 2018, 22,190 engine deliveries were forecast (including several turboprop engine models), led by the Honeywell HTF7000, Williams FJ44 and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW300. The average utilization was forecast to be 365 flight hours per aircraft per year.

===Engines===

Built by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, variants of the PW300 power the Dassault Falcon 7X and Dassault Falcon 8X trijets and Dassault Falcon 2000 twinjet.
The 10,000–20,000 lbf (45–89 kN) PW800 was launched in 2008 but was selected for the Cessna Citation Columbus, cancelled a year after. It was then chosen for the Gulfstream G500/G600 launched in 2014 and due to enter service in 2018/2019, and picked in 2018 for the Dassault Falcon 6X 2021 first flight.
The Safran Silvercrest was rejected for the cancelled Falcon 5X, it is still selected for the Cessna Citation Hemisphere, but the aircraft development is suspended until the turbofan is perfected.
GE Aviation produces the Passport for the Bombardier Global 7500, due to enter service in 2018, and is developing an engine for the supersonic Aerion AS2.

Rolls-Royce plc was revealed as the engine supplier for the Global 5500/6500 with the Rolls-Royce Pearl 15, an improved BR710 resembling the Gulfstream G650&#x27;s BR725.
The AE3007C powered Cessna Citation X+ is near its production end.
The Honeywell HTF7700L replaced the Silvercrest for the Citation Longitude, due to enter service in 2018, and already powers the Bombardier Challenger 300/350, Gulfstream G280 and Embraer Legacy 450/500.
Its TFE731 powers the Learjet 70/75 and Dassault Falcon 900LX.
Williams International’s FJ44 powers the Pilatus PC-24, launched in 2013 and introduced in early 2018, the Nextant 400XTi and the in-development SyberJet SJ30i, as well as the Cessna Citation CJ3+/4, while the smaller FJ33 powers the Cirrus Vision SF50 single-engine business jet.

==Operators==

There are three basic types of operators that own, manage and operate private jets.

===Flight departments===

Flight departments are corporate-owned operators that manage the aircraft of a specific company. Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, and Altria are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under FAR 91 operating rules.

A 2010 study by the United States National Business Aviation Association found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.

===Charter companies===

Charter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.

In the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under FAR 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft&#x27;s owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft&#x27;s owner).

Aircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The Department of Transportation requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like &quot;our fleet of aircraft&quot;, &quot;we operate&quot;, &quot;our charter service&quot; and others.

===Fractional ownership ===
Since 1996 the term &quot;fractional jet&quot; has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as flight crew, hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.

Fractional ownership of aircraft involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a &quot;quarter share&quot;). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA part 91 or part 135.

Buying blocks of time in predetermined increments involves buying blocks of time in hours. This model usually depends on how many flight hours a client will be needing. Pay as you fly resembles the business model used by commercial airlines where a client only pays for a flight they use. The downside to this model is that clients find it difficult to secure flights because most private flights are usually booked in advance.

Paying a flat rate for unlimited usage as the name implies, uses a business model where clients pay a flat rate, and then the jet is made available to them for the duration that payment lasts. This model makes it possible for a client to pay a certain amount for unlimited access and usage to a jet, or a fleet of jets for the duration. This model has been discontinued by most private jet hire companies because clients have exploited the usage in the past. This model now employs a fair usage policy.

=== Surveillance ===

With smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as surveillance aircraft to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:
* the , 6,000 nmi Bombardier Global 6000 is the platform for the USAF Northrop Grumman E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance Raytheon Sentinel for the UK Royal Air Force, and Saab&#x27;s GlobalEye AEW&amp;C carrying its Erieye AESA radar as UK&#x27;s Marshall ADG basis for Elint/Sigint for the United Arab Emirates; it is also the base for the proposed Saab AB Swordfish MPA and the USAF Lockheed Martin J-Stars Recap battlefield-surveillance program, while IAI&#x27;s ELI-3360 MPA is based on the Global 5000;
* The , 6,750 nmi Gulfstream G550 was selected for the IAI EL/W-2085 Conformal Airborne Early Warning AESA radar for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while L3 Technologies transfers the U.S. Compass Call electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia&#x27;s program, Northrop Grumman proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;
* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the Japan Coast Guard with a mission system developed with L3 and Thales Group;
* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for AEW&amp;C, MPA and multi-intelligence;

==Classes==
Business jets can be categorized according to their size.

===Very light jets===

The very light jet (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the Eclipse 500, on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft. Its introduction coincided with a speculative bubble for air taxi services, exemplified by DayJet, which ceased operations in September 2008. Eclipse Aviation failed to sustain its business model and filed for bankruptcy in February 2009.

A MTOW limit was cited by engineering company Burns &amp; McDonnell in 2005, Popular Mechanics in 2007, or GlobalSecurity.org.

Cessna simultaneously developed the Citation Mustang, a six-place twinjet (2 crew + 4 passengers), followed by the Embraer Phenom 100 and the Honda Jet. They have a maximum takeoff weight lighter than the FAR Part 23 12,500 pounds limit, and are approved for single-pilot operation. They typically accommodate 6–7 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price.

===Light jets===
Light jets have been a staple of the business jet industry since the advent of the Learjet 23 in the early 1960s. They provide access to small airports and the speed to be an effective air travel tool. Aircraft of this class include:
* Beechcraft Premier
* Cessna CitationJet/CJ1/2/3
* Cessna Citation II/Bravo/Ultra/Encore
* Embraer Phenom 300
* Hawker 400
* Learjet 31
* Learjet 40

They typically accommodate 6–8 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price.

===Mid-size jets===
These aircraft are suitable for longer-range travel such as transcontinental flights and for travel with larger passenger capacity requirements. Aircraft of this class include:
* Citation Excel/XLS(+),
* Hawker 800/750/850/900/1000,
* Learjet 45
* Learjet 60.

They typically accommodate 9 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price.

===Super mid-size jets===
Super mid-size jets feature wide-body cabin space, high-altitude capability, speed, and long range. These jets combine transatlantic capability with the speed and comfort of a wide-body, high-altitude aircraft. Aircraft of this class include:
* Bombardier Challenger 300/350
* Cessna Citation Sovereign
* Cessna Citation X
* Dassault Falcon 50
* Gulfstream G200/G250
* Hawker 4000
They typically accommodate 10–11 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price:

===Large jets===

* Bombardier Challenger 600
* Dassault Falcon 2000(ER)
* Dassault Falcon 900
* Embraer Legacy 600/650

They typically accommodate 13–14 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price.

===Long range jets===

* Dassault Falcon 7X
* Bombardier Global Express/5000/6000
* Gulfstream IV/G350/G450
* Gulfstream V/G500/G550
* Gulfstream G650(ER)

They typically accommodate 12–19 passengers over a nmi average range, with a $M mean price.

At , the G650ER has the widest cabin yet but should be joined by the Falcon 5X (a Global 5000/G500 competitor) and its replacement, and the Citation Hemisphere in 2021; at , the Global 7000/8000 is wider than the Global 5000/6000, the same as the Gulfstream G500/G600 and the Canadair Challenger, while the Dassault Falcon 8X is wide and the G450/G550 .

===VIP airliners ===

&quot;Business airliner&quot; can be contracted as &quot;bizliner&quot;. Airliners converted into business jets are used by sports teams or VIPs with a large entourage or press corps. Such airplanes can face operational restrictions based on runway length or local noise restrictions. They can be the most expensive type of private jet as they provide the greatest space and capabilities.

Aircraft of this class include:
* Airbus Corporate Jets
* Boeing Business Jet
* Embraer Lineage 1000

== Environmental impact ==

Calculations suggest that people traveling in their own private jets leave a disproportionate carbon footprint relative to those who use commercial jetliners or other means of travel. Some individuals travel over annually, generating thousands of tons of emissions.

=== Tracking projects ===
As a reaction to the disproportionate emission of greenhouse gases by private jets, projects dedicated to tracking the movement of these airplanes in general, as well as the jets owned by specific celebrities, politicians, entrepreneuers and elite groups, have gained widespread attention by the internet public and the media. The programmer Jack Sweeney became known for his various social media accounts that track jets owned by individuals such as Taylor Swift, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, and Drake.

<text>Paul Howard Manship (December 25, 1885 – January 31, 1966) was an American sculptor. He consistently created mythological pieces in a classical style, and was a major force in the Art Deco movement. He is well known for his large public commissions, including the iconic &quot;Prometheus&quot; in Rockefeller Center and the &quot;Celestial Sphere Woodrow Wilson Memorial&quot; in Geneva, Switzerland. He is also credited for designing the modern rendition of New York City&#x27;s official seal.

Manship gained notice early in his career for rejecting the Beaux-Arts architecture movement and preferring linear compositions with a flowing simplicity. Additionally, he shared a summer home in Plainfield, New Hampshire, part of the Cornish Art Colony, with William Zorach for a number of years. Other members of the highly social colony were also contemporary artists. Manship created his own artist retreat on Cape Ann, developing a 15-acre site on two former granite quarries in Lanesville, a village of Gloucester, MA. A local nonprofit, the Manship Artists Residency + Studios was established in 2015 to preserve this estate as an artist residency program.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
Paul Howard Manship was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on December 25, 1885, the son of Charles H. and Mary Etta (Friend) Manship. His father, born in Mississippi, was a clerk for the St. Paul gas company, and with his wife, who was born in Pennsylvania, were parents of seven children. Charles and Mary were married in St. Paul, on July 14, 1870, and raised their family in a home they owned at 304 Nelson (later Marshall) Avenue. Paul H. Manship began his art studies at the St. Paul School of Art in Minnesota. From there he moved to Philadelphia and continued his education at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Following that he migrated to New York City where he enrolled in the Art Students League of New York, studying anatomy with George Bridgman and modeling under Hermon Atkins MacNeil. From 1905 to 1907 he served as an assistant to sculptor Solon Borglum and spent the two years after that studying with Charles Grafly and assisting Isidore Konti.

In 1909, at Konti&#x27;s urging, he entered the competition for, and won, the Rome Prize and shortly thereafter decamped for Rome where he attended the American Academy from 1909 until 1912. While in Europe he became increasingly interested in Archaic art, his own work began to take on some archaic features, and he became more and more attracted to classical subjects. He also developed an interest in classical sculpture of India, and traces of that influence can be observed in his work (see &quot;Dancer and Gazelles&quot; in Gallery). Manship was one of the first artists to become aware of the vast scope of art history being newly excavated at the time and became intensely interested in Egyptian, Assyrian and pre-classical Greek sculpture.

=== Career ===

When he returned to the United States from his European sojourn, Manship found that his style was attractive to both modernists and conservatives. His simplification of line and detail appealed to those who wished to move beyond the Beaux-Arts classical realism prevalent in the day. Also, his view of and use of a more traditional &quot;beauty&quot; as well as an avoidance of the more radical and abstract trends in art made his works attractive to more conservative art collectors. Manship&#x27;s work is often considered to be a major precursor to Art Deco.

Manship produced over 700 works and always employed assistants of the highest quality. At least two of them, Gaston Lachaise and Leo Friedlander, went on to create significant places for themselves in the history of American sculpture.

Although not known as a portraitist, he did produce statues and busts of Theodore Roosevelt, Samuel Osgood, John D. Rockefeller, Robert Frost, Gifford Beal, and Henry L. Stimson. Manship was very adept at low relief and used these skills to produce a large number of coins and medals. Among his more prominent are the Dionysus medal, the second issue of the long running Society of Medalists; the first term inaugural medal for Franklin D. Roosevelt; and the John F. Kennedy inaugural medal. Additionally, during WW II he designed the U. S. Merchant Marine&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal and Mariner&#x27;s Medal.

Manship was chosen by the American Battle Monuments Commission to create monuments following both the First and Second World Wars. They are located respectively in the American Cemetery at Thiaucourt, France in 1926, and in the military cemetery at Anzio, Italy. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics.

=== Affiliations and awards ===
For a number of summers early in his career, Manship found social and artistic companionship in Plainfield, New Hampshire, then part of the Cornish Art Colony, which attracted sculptors such as Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Herbert Adams, Daniel Chester French, and William Zorach. He visited first in 1915, returned the next three years, and then returned again a decade later. This period in his life has been recognized as significant, and Harry Rand observed that &quot;Manship recognized 1916 as the year of his artistic maturity...[he] seemed to express modern ideas in terms of the primitive.

Manship served on the board of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and chaired the board. Manship was affiliated with the National Academy of Design, the National Sculpture Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1937 to 1941. His many honors include a Pierpont Morgan fellowship, a Widener Gold Medal from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, and the award of Chevalier from the French Legion of Honor. Manship&#x27;s extensive papers, maquettes and sculptures are housed in the Smithsonian&#x27;s Archives of American Art. In 2004 the Smithsonian mounted a retrospective of Manship&#x27;s career which resulted in a reappraisal of the sculptor&#x27;s work.

From 2007 to 2015, there was a gallery dedicated to the display of Manship&#x27;s work at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. It featured twenty-five of the nearly five hundred Manship artworks from the museum&#x27;s collection.

Paul Manship was the father of the artist John Paul Manship (1927–2000).

<text>EXIT were a performance art group during the mid-1970s. EXIT members Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher later founded anarchist punk rock band Crass, adopting many of EXIT&#x27;s experimental/multi media techniques into Crass&#x27; presentation.

The group performed as part of the 1972 ICES festival at the Roundhouse.

Rimbaud acknowledges that EXIT in turn had been involved with the Fluxus Movement (of which Yoko Ono was a member). He also states that Crass was more influenced by the avant-garde than by any rock &amp; roll precedent.

<text>Welland is a city in the Regional Municipality of Niagara in Southern Ontario, Canada. As of 2021, it had a population of 55,750.

The city is in the centre of Niagara and located within a half-hour driving distance to Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake, St. Catharines, and Port Colborne. It has been traditionally known as the place &quot;where rails and water meet&quot;, referring to the railways from Buffalo to Toronto and Southwestern Ontario, and the waterways of Welland Canal and Welland River, which played a great role in the city&#x27;s development. The city has developed on both sides of the Welland River and Welland Canal, which connect Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.

==History==

The area was settled in 1788 by United Empire Loyalists who had been granted land by the Crown to compensate for losses due to property they left in the British Thirteen Colonies during and after the American Revolutionary War.

Tensions continued between Great Britain and the newly independent United States, and the War of 1812 broke out. On 19 October 1814, Canadian forces led by George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, met an American raiding party, numbering approximately nine hundred, near the eastern edge of the present community during the Battle of Cook&#x27;s Mills. After an intense skirmish, the Americans retreated to Buffalo, New York. Cook&#x27;s Mills was the second to last engagement of the War of 1812 on Canadian soil.

The First Welland Canal was extended in 1833 to reach Lake Erie and has influenced development of this city ever since. A wooden aqueduct was built to carry the Welland Canal over the Welland River at what is now downtown Welland, and the area became known as simply Aqueduct. A lock to cross from the canal to the river and vice versa was also built. A small shantytown soon developed around the facility, providing essential services in what was a convenient stop-over location for travellers and workers on the canal.

The growing town was later named Merrittsville, after William Hamilton Merritt, the initiator of the Welland Canal project. This name is reflected in the name of the Merrittville Highway (Niagara Road 50), which served as the primary north–south route in central Niagara before the construction of Highway 406. Welland gained its present name when it was incorporated on 25 July 1858. It became a city in 1917.

One of the few railway crossings across the canal was near Welland. Together with the canal, these two factors attracted the development of heavy industry in Welland. In 1906 the Plymouth Cordage Company was the first major industrial company to open a plant in Welland. By the 1930s, Welland was an important industrial city in the region and was developing rapidly.

In the 1960s, the city was starting to outgrow the canal passing through its core. The Welland By-Pass project, started in 1967 and finished in 1973, provided a new, shorter alignment for the Welland Canal by moving it from downtown Welland to the city&#x27;s outskirts. With the completion of the bypass, Welland&#x27;s east end (and the former town of Crowland) was like an island between the new and old canal channels.

The City of Welland is working to revitalize the downtown core through an ongoing community improvement plan. Integral to the program is the use of incentives to promote revitalization and redevelopment. A report published by the City of Welland in 2013 said, &quot;for over 10 years now, these programs have produced only very moderate uptake and development since being introduced.&quot; Other former industrial cities have grappled with similar painful transitions.

==Government==

The Welland city council is made up of 12 councillors, each elected in his or her ward (this is known as election by single-member districts). Each of the six wards in Welland elects two councillors. It is led by the mayor, who is elected at-large, by all the voters in the city. Welland&#x27;s current mayor is Frank Campion.

In addition, two regional councillors are elected at-large, to participate in the Niagara Regional Council. These councillors were George Marshall and the late Peter Kormos, who died in March 2013. Another representative of Welland was appointed to fill Kormos&#x27;s seat since late May 2013, in order to represent the city on the Regional Council.
The city is responsible for fire protection, libraries, parks and recreation and secondary streets, but many municipal services come from the broader level of government, the Niagara Region. Regional responsibilities include social welfare, community health, and policing through the Niagara Regional Police.

The chief local political issue is the redevelopment of the downtown core, which has deteriorated in the years after the Welland By-Pass project. The Civic Square project has been completed after spanning the terms of three city councils and three mayors. The new building, facing both East Main Street and the old canal, houses the city hall and the Welland Public Library. The project is proving to be a catalyst for development, as several new establishments have been opened downtown and some businesses are expanding.

Welland is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by the Liberal Party Member of Parliament Vance Badawey, and in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by the NDP Member of Provincial Parliament Jeff Burch, representing the Niagara Centre and the provincial ridings of Niagara Centre, respectively.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada, Welland had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2021, 87.0% of the population was white/European, 8.7% were visible minorities and 4.3% were Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups were Black (2.6%), South Asian (1.6%), Latin American (1.3%), Filipino (0.7%), Southeast Asian (0.5%), and Chinese (0.5%).

80.2% of residents spoke English as a mother tongue. French was the first language of 7.2% of the population, compared to 3.3% in all of Ontario. In terms of non-official languages, the most common mother tongues were Italian (2.1%), Spanish (1.0%), Hungarian (0.6%), Polish (0.6%), Korean (0.4%), German (0.4%) and Chinese languages (0.4%). 1.5% of residents listed both English and French as mother tongues, while 1.2% listed both English and a non-official language.

62.4% of residents were Christian, down from 77.2% in 2011. 35.1% were Catholic, 15.1% were Protestant, 7.7% identified as Christian without specifying and 4.5% belonged to other Christian denominations or Christian-related traditions. 34.9% were non-religious or secular, up from 22.0% in 2011. All other religions accounted for 2.3% of the population, up from 0.8% in 2011. The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (0.9%), Hinduism (0.4%) and Sikhism (0.4%).

Another significant cultural group was established with the opening of the Plymouth Cordage plant. Many workers relocated to Welland from the company&#x27;s operations in Plymouth, Massachusetts were of Italian origin. To minimize the potential effects of cultural and language barriers, Plymouth Cordage sent four foremen to Welland: one was Italian, one French, one German and one English. The neighbourhood that the company built for its employees, now the &quot;Plymouth Cordage Heritage District&quot;, became the first Italian ethnic neighbourhood in Welland.
==Education==

Like the rest of Ontario, Welland has access to four public education systems: the regional school boards are the Niagara Catholic District School Board and the District School Board of Niagara. The Conseil scolaire Viamonde (the French public board) and the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (the French Catholic board) also operate schools in Welland.

The Niagara Catholic District School Board operates six elementary schools within the city. The board also operates one secondary school in the city: Notre Dame, which offers Grade 9 through to Grade 12. Continuing education courses are also offered by the board at its Father Patrick H. Fogarty Learning Centre within the city.

The District School Board of Niagara operates ten elementary schools within the city and two secondary schools: Welland Centennial Secondary School servicing the western side of the city and Eastdale Secondary servicing the eastern side.

A campus of Niagara College of Applied Arts and Technology is located in Welland. The college offers post-secondary diplomas, baccalaureate degrees and advanced-level programs. From 1995 to 2001, the city was home to a satellite campus of the defunct francophone Collège des Grands-Lacs.

==Economy==
Welland, because of its proximity to the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric station at Niagara Falls, was historically known for its steel, automotive, and textile industries. Initially, manufacturing firms were the biggest employers in Welland. The plants of companies like Union Carbide, United Steel, Plymouth Cordage Company, three drop forges, a cotton mill, and the Atlas Steel Co., as well as general manufacturing plants, had big influence on shaping early Welland. While recent years saw the end of Welland operations for several companies, such as John Deere which announced in September 2008 that it would be closing its plant and relocating manufacturing to Wisconsin and Mexico, businesses such as Lakeside Steel (a pipe plant formerly owned by Stelco, since 2012 owned by JMC Steel) continues to employ residents.

The Atlas Steel Co. was founded at some time in the 1920s. Roy H. Davis and partners bought the Welland plant from its American shareholders in 1928. Gun barrels were produced here during the second World War. It was for a time Canada&#x27;s largest manufacturer of stainless steel. The plant housed a vacuum smelter line, necessary for the production of Titanium. The onset of the CanAm FTA, NAFTA, GATT and globalization brought decline, and subsequently the ownership changed hands numerous times: the Sammi group acquired it in 1989, followed by Slater Steels of Mississauga in 2000, who went bankrupt in 2003. The plant was finally torn down in 2007.

The Canadian branch plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company was started in 1904 due to Parliament&#x27;s initiation of a 25% import duty on rope and related products. Plymouth, with roots in Massachusetts, moved to secure its business in binding twine, necessary to package farm crops such as grass, wheat or straw. The city of Welland grew up around the Plymouth plant, which was prior to 1904, farmland. The cordage industry was a victim of the harvester-thresher, which obviated the need for binding (or baling) twine, as the threshing operation is now performed in a contiguous step immediately when the stalk is cut.

Welland&#x27;s electricity comes from the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric generation plants at Niagara Falls via Welland Hydro. Thanks to the presence of the massive plant, power remained on in over half of Welland during the 2003 North America blackout until rolling blackouts began the next day in an effort to provide power to areas that hadn&#x27;t had it for nearly 24 hours.

==Geography==

Welland is located in the centre of south Niagara. Over the years, urban growth has all but united the northwest part of Welland with the community of Fonthill.

Prior to the Welland By-Pass project, the Welland Canal cut through the centre of Welland. As a result, a very prominent split was created between the east side and the west side of the city. The west side grew primarily to the north, while the east side expanded south. The west side also became the more affluent of the two. Today, even though the canal traffic no longer causes regular interruption in the traffic across the city, the channel lives on as Welland Recreational Waterway. The waterway still serves as a very prominent visual feature dividing the city, and it is perhaps for this reason that the east side/west side division is still very much alive in the minds of Wellanders. &quot;East side&quot; and &quot;west side&quot; are very commonly used as basic directions.

The communities of Cooks Mills and Dain City have their own separation stories. Cooks Mills, located on the other side of the By-Pass channel than the rest of Welland, has arguably been protected against the impact of urban sprawl, but the necessity of using one of the two highway tunnels to cross the canal causes some residents to head to nearby Niagara Falls instead. Dain City, located in the south of the city where the two channels meet, is separated by the massive approaches to the Townline Tunnel required to provide the low grade for the rail lines that use the tunnel. Dain City was built for, and by, the Dain Manufacturing Company (Now known as John Deere), the main employer in the area, as a &quot;company town&quot;. John Deere announced in September 2008 that it would be closing its plant and relocating manufacturing to Wisconsin and Mexico.

There is a slight movement to develop the northern end of the east side, an undeveloped area. A community named Hunters Pointe is being built close to the banks of the By-Pass, and the area received further investment when a new Wal-Mart store opened on Woodlawn Road close to Highway 406.

Technically, both the east side and Dain City are peninsulas, surrounded by the waters of the old and new channels of the Welland Canal and connected to &quot;solid&quot; ground only by the relatively small plug in the old canal along the Townline Tunnel approaches.

Crowland is a former township created in 1788 that grew up around Ontario Road and Welland Recreational Canal. 
A man-made geographic feature is the Merritt Island, a strip of land approximately five kilometres long and, in some places, less than 100 metres wide. The island was created when the alignment of the First Welland Canal was constructed basically parallel to the Welland River and since the abandonment of the old canal has been established as Merritt Park, featuring a popular four kilometre-long paved trail.

=== Climate ===
Welland experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;) typical of the Great Lakes region, with cold, snowy winters, mild, wet springs, warm to hot, humid summers, and cool, wet falls. The winter is the driest season, with no more than 77.8 mm (3.06 in.) of precipitation in its wettest month. Though, due to lake-effect snow, the city receives, on average, 97.8 cm (38.5 in.) of snow every winter. The average temperature in January, the coldest month, is −4.7 °C (23.5 °F). Spring is mild (13 °C (55.4 °F) on average) and rainy (240.3 mm (9.46 in.) of rain in April, May and June, also with 5.4 cm (2.12 in.) of snow in April and May). Summer is warm, with an average high temperature of 24.5 °C (76.2 °F) and, humid, with 251 mm (9.88in.) of total rainfall. Autumn is cool (average temperature of 4.3 °C (39.7 °F)) and wet (actually, the wettest of Welland&#x27;s seasons) (273.7 mm 10.8 in.) of total precipitation. The extreme high and low temperatures are 37.8 °C (100 °F), recorded on 4 July 1911; 1 July 1931; 26 August 1948, and −32.8 °C (-27 °F), recorded on 25 January 1884. Daily precipitation extremes include a rainfall of 118.4 mm (4.66 in.) on 30 September 1959, and a snowfall of 81.3 cm (32.0 inches) on 1 March 1900. One of the worst winter storms to affect the Welland area was in January 1977 when the Blizzard of &#x27;77 hit Niagara and Western New York from 28 January to 1 February 1977.

===Parks===
Notable parks are Chippawa Park, an older, well-developed park in the northwest; Memorial Park, a newer park in the southeast which has been shrunk for suburban development; and Merritt Island Park along the canal with an upper level paved trail and lower level gravel trail.

Chippawa Park has rolling hills, mature specimen trees (predominantly Carolinian, including several species of Hickory and Maple), playgrounds, a large pond, and small ornamental fish pond in a formal rose garden. It features a large war memorial carved from Lacasse granite and designed by a famous Canadian sculptor, Elizabeth Wyn Wood.

Memorial Park was a project of the 1967 Centennial. It is very flat with younger trees. It has an outdoor pool shaped like a figure 8. There is also a cenotaph at this park. In the late 1960s, the eastern part of the park was used for the Welland Canal bypass. Patrons of the park can often see ships passing through the bypass.

At the heart of the old city of Welland, near the Main Street Bridge, the Welland River passes under the old Welland Canal, then runs parallel to it for a few miles. Between the old canal and the river lies a long narrow strip of land referred to as Merritt Island that is now a park. The end of the park closest to the centre of the city has picnic tables and playground equipment. The island also includes a main trail that follows the bank of the old canal for the entire length of the park, with a variety of intermittent side paths and trails.

Also located in the heart of downtown, between Main Street and Division Street bridges along the west side of the Welland Recreational Waterway, is a small parkette dubbed &quot;Guerrilla Park&quot; by locals. It was originally park space that had become neglected over years and was reclaimed as public space by volunteers. Through efforts of local artists and guerrilla gardening, the formerly neglected space is now tended by various unorganized volunteers, and features revitalized garden beds and flowers, outdoor paintings, and occasional impromptu events.

===Welland Canal trails===
The Welland Canal Parkway Trail is a paved recreational path beginning in the City of St. Catharines at Lake Ontario and ending at Lake Erie in Port Colborne. The sections of the trail located within Welland are paved. The trail follows alongside the Welland ship and Recreational Canals, and passes through downtown Welland.

==Transport==

=== Welland Canal ===

The Welland Canal, linking Lake Ontario with Lake Erie, is the transportation mode that Welland is best known for. Until 1972, the canal passed through downtown Welland. As of the end of the 1972 shipping season, the canal was re-routed via the Welland Canal Bypass east of the city. Welland clings to its canal heritage, as evidenced by the steadfast preservation of the Main Street Lift Bridge (Welland Canal, bridge 13) shown in the photograph above.

===Roads===

Highway 406 is the main route in and out of Welland, leading north to Thorold, St. Catharines and onwards via Queen Elizabeth Way.

Port Colborne is linked to Welland by Highways 140 and 58. Port Colborne residents then can take the 406 further north.

The Mid-Peninsula Highway, once constructed, can play an important role in the transportation patterns of Welland, as it might cross the Welland Canal along the Highway 58A corridor in the south of the city. Should that occur, Highway 406 will likely be extended to reach the new thoroughfare.

Two of the three tunnels under the canal, Main Street Tunnel and Townline Tunnel, are located in Welland, just east of the main urbanised area.

===Railways===

Welland boasts a rich railway history. The city motto is &quot;Where Rails and Water Meet&quot;, referring to the two prevalent means of transportation. The Canada Southern Railway (CASO) passed through the south end of Welland, with a passenger station on King Street. The CASO operated very few trains of its own – the majority of traffic on the line consisted of New York Central Railway trains transiting between Windsor, Ontario (and the tunnel to Detroit), and one of two bridges over the Niagara River located at Niagara Falls and Fort Erie.

Welland was also the terminus of the Toronto, Hamilton &amp; Buffalo Railway&#x27;s track (the link to Buffalo, New York being via the CASO line). The T, H &amp; B ran joint passenger trains with the New York Central to provide through service between Toronto and Buffalo (via Hamilton, Ontario and Welland).

There was also a Canadian National Railways (earlier, Grand Trunk Railway) line running in a north–south direction and crossing the CASO line at Welland Diamond. An interlocking tower (WX) stood here. Another line ran through the Dain City area of south Welland. This was the Canada Air Line Railway, and was also used by the Wabash Railway. Later, it became the Cayuga Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway.

Lastly, the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway provided electric radial service from Port Colborne, Ontario to Thorold, Ontario via Welland. Passenger service ended in November 1959, but the tracks remained in freight use until 1981 when a trestle over the Welland River became unsafe and the line was removed from service.

The relocation of the Welland Canal in the early 1970s caused massive changes in the local railway network. The new route of the canal was previously crossed by five separate railway lines. The new segment of canal would have no bridges, and just one railway tunnel, so all of these routes required redesign. The two branches of the CASO line, plus the Cayuga Subdivision were re-routed through the Townline Tunnel, while the North/South Canadian National line was split and discontinued as a through route. The station at King Street was abandoned and demolished. It was replaced by a new station outside of town, but passenger service ended soon after.

Today, Welland is the location of one of only two remaining railway crossings that span the Welland Canal. The Townline Tunnel is built for three railway tracks, but the center track was removed in the early 1990s. Now, only two tracks run through the tunnel. The north track is the Canadian Pacific Railway Hamilton subdivision. The south track was formerly the Canadian National Railway Cayuga subdivision. Since the abandonment of the majority of that subdivision, operations on this track were limited to occasional trains interchanging with Trillium Rail&#x27;s Port Colborne Harbour Railway. Today, Canadian Pacific also uses this track as their &quot;Brookfield Siding&quot;.

There is also a Trillium Railway (Port Colborne Harbour Railway) north–south line running through the east side of Welland on the former Welland Canal railway/Canadian National tracks beside the former site of the Atlas Specialty Steels plant (torn down in 2007). A daily as requested (Monday to Friday) train operates along this route to Merritton. Trillium Railway has a handful of industries throughout Thorold and St. Catharines, on the former Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto trackage. No passenger trains stop in Welland – the closest Via Rail stations are in St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. Via Rail ceased operations of their own trains to these stations on 25 October 2012. Amtrak does operate 2 trains to these stations, under Via Rail control.

Prior to the Welland Canal relocation in the early 1970s, there were two bridges crossing the old canal. The busiest was a swing bridge located between the Lincoln and Broadway bridges (the CASO line). This bridge was a relic of an earlier canal, and although it does not swing any longer, it remains in railway use. Once or twice per week, a local Trillium Rwy way freight crosses this bridge to access Vesuvius Industries on the west side of the old canal located on Trillium Rwy&#x27;s West Welland Spur. The second crossing was as vertical-lift bridge at Dain City, Ontario which also remains in use as the Trillium Rail Canal line. Prior to 1967, this section of The Canal line was referred to as CN&#x27;s Cayuga Subdivision. The Cayuga Subdivision was then re-routed through the Townline Tunnel, which is to the north of Dain City. This section through Dain City was renamed the Canal Subdivision from this location at CN Welland Diamond, where it connects to the north–south trackage (former CN Welland Subdivision). This east-west trackage head continues to this day westward to a rail junction the by-pass of what is now operated as Trillium&#x27;s Cayuga Spur, (Former location 3 miles away, west of Phillip&#x27;s Road where the original ground of the CN Cayuga Subdivision continued onto St. Thomas, ON. Do note that CP Brookfield Siding becomes Trillium&#x27;s Cayuga Spur where the Feeder Canal once cross through, prior to the building of this Townline Tunnel infrastructure, in the 1800s. This Cayuga Subdivision by-pass runs from between Wilhelm Road and Troup Road, east of Welland and to the west between Phillip&#x27;s Road (mentioned above) Green Road S,(Formerly Farr Road S.). In total, the Cayuga Subdivision by-pass was a total length of 8.9 miles.

A recent initiative proposed by local businessmen and politicians, in particular Trillium Railway owner Wayne Ettinger and former mayor Damian Goulbourne calls for the planned GO Train extension into the Niagara Region to include a station — and cross the Welland Canal — in Welland rather than St. Catharines. The proponents argue that an adequate rail line is already in place and using the Trillium&#x27;s track through the Townline Tunnel would allow for uninterrupted train traffic to Niagara Falls. They also point out that a station in Welland would fit in the Niagara Region&#x27;s &quot;Grow South&quot; policy of expanding the infrastructure south of the Niagara Escarpment.

===Air===

The closest airport to Welland is the Welland/Niagara Central Airport on the western edge of the city. It is a small field airport and is not served by any regular links, but it is an international point of entry. However, the airport is under a number of developments in hopes to expand its services. For now, most air travellers use either Toronto&#x27;s Pearson Airport, Bishop Airport or Hamilton&#x27;s Munro Airport. The Buffalo Niagara Airport is the closest, although it requires that travellers cross the American border. Another option for Wellanders is St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport with flights to Toronto&#x27;s Bishop Airport, on FlyGTA Airways as well as various charter flights to/from Niagara.

===Public transit===

Between 1912 and 1930, local streetcar service was provided in Welland by the Niagara, Welland and Lake Erie railway which operated on East Main Street and King Street (then known as South Main Street). This company also provided a short-lived service on West Main Street and Niagara Street (then known as North Main) for about 6 months in 1922.

From 1973 to 2022, Welland Transit operated the public transport service of scheduled bus services and paratransit covering the city. Also provided was &quot;Welland-St. Catharines Connection&quot;, a link to the St. Catharines public transit system from Niagara College to Brock University terminal in St. Catharines, with the first and last run of the day interconnecting to the downtown core. Service was also provided to Port Colborne and Pelham.

In 2023, Niagara Region Transit acquired Welland Transit, along with St. Catharines Transit and Niagara Falls Transit. Services remain largely unchanged with the exception of extended service hours and changes to the fare structure.

==Events==

The Concerts on the Canal series provides a line-up of free Friday night summer concerts on the floating stage at Merritt Park.

Niagara Regional Exhibition, running since 1853, is held at the Fairgrounds in the north end of the city every fall. Tradition stands that on at least one of the operational days it will rain.

The city will host the 2018 Canoe Polo World Championships at the Welland International Flatwater Centre.

Welland FloatFest began in 2016 and usually occurs for one day in July. The aim of the event is to encourage participants to enjoy the Welland Recreational Waterway by use of an inflatable. The event is complemented with vendors and a concert. In 2017, FloatFest gained a Guinness World Record for a line of touching inflatables that extended 165 metres in the canal to make it into the record book.

The Welland Zombie Walk is a community-based event held in October for the past several years.

<doc id="247017" wikidata="Q1778963" url="?curid=247017" title="Koko the Clown">
<text>Koko the Clown is an animated cartoon character created by Max Fleischer. His first appearance as the main protagonist in &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; (1918–1929), a major animated series of the silent era. Throughout the series, he goes on many adventures with his canine companion &quot;Fitz the Dog&quot;, who would later evolve into Bimbo in the Betty Boop cartoons.

==History==
The character originated when Max Fleischer invented the rotoscope, a device that allowed for animation to be more lifelike by tracing motion picture footage of human movement. The use of the clown character came after two previous tests and a search for an original character. Fleischer filmed his brother Dave in a clown costume. After tracing the film footage amounting to some 2,500 drawings and a year&#x27;s work, the character that would eventually become Koko the Clown was born, although he did not have a name until 1924. &quot;The Clown&quot;&#x27;s appearance owes much to The Yama Yama Man. Dave&#x27;s clown costume was clearly inspired by one worn by Bessie McCoy, with the additions of a black ruffled collar replacing the big white bow, three pom-pom front buttons, and a prominent cone-shaped cap also with three pom-poms. The white face with slit eyes was a design common among German circus clowns. Both costumes have white gloves with long fingers, white foot coverings, and a hat with the same white pom-pom as in front. A 1922 sheet music drawing makes the connection more explicit, saying &quot;Out of the Inkwell, the New Yama Yama Clown&quot;, with a picture of Koko.

Because of the realistic effects displayed in his sample films, the result of Fleischer&#x27;s Rotoscope, and a past relationship with John R. Bray, he was hired as production manager for John R. Bray Studios, and in 1918 they began &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; as an entry in the &quot;Bray Pictograph Screen Magazine&quot; released through Paramount (1918), and later Goldwyn (1919-1921). Aside from the novelty of the Rotoscoped animation, this series combined live-action and animation centered on Max Fleischer as the creative cartoonist and &quot;Master&quot; of &quot;The Clown&quot;. &quot;The Clown&quot; would often slip from Max&#x27;s eye and go on an adventure, pull a prank on his creator. Fleischer wrote, and animated the early shorts along with Roland Crandall, with Dave directing the live action filming, performing on camera as &quot;The Clown&quot; for Rotoscoping, and assisted with the animation and Roto tracings.

The series was very popular, and in 1921 Max and Dave Fleischer formed their own studio, Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. Their films were distributed through the States Rights method through Warner Bros., Winkler Pictures, Standard, and finally The Red Seal Pictures Corporation. The &quot;Clown&quot; was named Ko-Ko in 1924 when Dick Huemer came to the studio as their animation supervisor, having animated on the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; series for eight years. He redesigned the &quot;Clown&quot; for more efficient animation production and moved the Fleischers away from their dependency upon the Rotoscope for fluid animation. Huemer created Ko-Ko&#x27;s canine companion, Fitz. Most importantly, Huemer set the drawing style that gave the series its distinctive look. The illustration at the heading is an example by Huemer.

In the films produced from 1924 to 1927, the clown&#x27;s name was hyphenated, &quot;Ko-Ko&quot;. The hyphen was dropped due to legal issues associated with the bankruptcy of the Fleischer&#x27;s partnership company, The Red Seal Pictures Corporation. Alfred Weiss presented the Fleischers with a new Paramount contract beginning in mid-1927, and &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; was retitled as &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot;. The series continued for two years until July 1929, ending with &quot;Chemical Koko&quot;. Due to alleged mismanagement under Alfred Weiss, the Inkwell Studios filed bankruptcy in January 1929, and Koko was put into retirement for two years. In 1931, the legal entanglements regarding Koko were resolved, and he returned to the screen beginning with &quot;The Herring Murder Case&quot; (1931) and became a regular in the new Fleischer &quot;Talkartoons&quot; series with costars, Betty Boop and Bimbo. Koko&#x27;s last theatrical appearance was in the &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; (1934), a remake of an &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; silent film, &quot;The Cure&quot; (1924).

==Koko in &quot;Kolor&quot;==
Koko&#x27;s first color appearance was a cameo in the cartoon &quot;Toys Will Be Toys&quot; (1949), one of the revived &quot;Screen Songs&quot; series produced by Famous Studios. In 1958, Max Fleischer set out to revive &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; for television, and a series of 100 color episodes were produced in 1960–1961 by Hal Seeger using the voice talents of Larry Storch. Only three episodes are known to still exist.

<text>Joseph Jules Léger (April 4, 1913November 22, 1980) was a Canadian diplomat and statesman who served as the 21st governor general of Canada from 1974 to 1979.

Léger was born in Quebec and educated in Quebec and France prior to starting a career in the Canadian Department of External Affairs, and eventually served as ambassador to a number of countries. He was in 1973 appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau, to replace Roland Michener as viceroy, and he occupied the post until succeeded by Edward Schreyer in 1979. As the Queen&#x27;s representative, Léger was credited for modernising the office and fostering Canadian unity.

On June 1, 1979, Léger was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, giving him the accordant style of &quot;The Honourable&quot;. However, as a former Governor General of Canada, Léger was entitled to be styled for life with the superior form of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. He died on November 22, 1980.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Saint-Anicet, Quebec, to Ernest and Alda (née Beauvais), Léger, along with his brother (and future cardinal), Paul-Émile, was raised in a devoutly religious family. After completing high school, Léger went on to the Collège de Valleyfield and then the Université de Montréal, where he completed a law degree. Léger subsequently enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris, from which he was awarded a doctorate in 1938, the same year that, on August 13, he married Gabrielle Carmel, whom he had met at the University of Paris. The couple together had two daughters, Francine and Helene.

When Léger returned to Canada at the end of 1938, he was hired as an associate editor of &quot;Le Droit&quot; in Ottawa, but remained there for only one year before he went on to become a professor of diplomatic history at the University of Ottawa until 1942. Simultaneously, Léger joined in 1940 the Department of External Affairs, and in just over 13 years received his first overseas diplomatic posting as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to Mexico. After his retirement from that office on August 1, 1954, he returned to Ottawa to act as under-secretary of state for external affairs, until, on September 25, 1958, he was commissioned as ambassador and permanent representative to the North Atlantic Council, occupying that post until 5 July 1962, as well as the Canadian representative to the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation in Paris. Then, from 1962 to 1964, Léger held the commission of ambassador to Italy, and, from 1964 to 1968 was the ambassador to France. It was during this time, in July 1967, that French president Charles de Gaulle visited Canada to attend Expo 67, and in Montreal gave his &quot;Vive le Québec libre&quot; speech. This event caused a diplomatic chill for many years between Canada and France; however, Léger attracted admiration for his subsequent sensitive handling of de Gaulle&#x27;s policy towards Quebec.

By 1968, Léger had returned to Canada&#x27;s capital and was appointed as under-secretary of state, providing the administrative basis for Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s foreign policy, and the policies on bilingualism and multiculturalism developed by the Cabinet chaired by Pearson&#x27;s successor, Pierre Trudeau. Léger left that position in 1972, and briefly served as ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg between March 1973 and January 1974.
His daughter Francine died by suicide at the Canadian Embassy in 1968.

== Governor General of Canada ==
It was on October 5, 1973 that Queen Elizabeth II had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s choice of Léger to succeed Roland Michener as the Queen&#x27;s representative. He was subsequently sworn-in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on January 14, of the following year.

Only six months later, just prior to a ceremony wherein he was to receive an honorary degree from the Université de Sherbrooke, Léger suffered a stroke, leaving him with impeded speech and a paralysed right arm. Though he returned to his viceregal duties not long after, presiding over an Order of Canada investiture in December 1974, his wife assisted him on many occasions, even reading parts of the Speech from the Throne in 1976 and 1978. Still, the Légers travelled across the country, encouraging Canadian unity at a time fraught with Quebec sovereignty disputes and perceived alienation by other regions, as well promoting the fine arts and artistic endeavours, aided at such by their friendships with painters such as Jean Paul Lemieux, Alfred Pellan, and Jean Dallaire. In 1978 Léger established the Jules Léger Prize for New Chamber Music. He also established an award for heritage conservation and the Jules Léger Scholarship to promote academic excellence in bilingual programs at the University of Regina.
Léger was credited with greatly modernising the Office of the Governor General, having, among other things, eschewed the traditional court dress of the Windsor uniform in favour of morning dress at state functions, though he was also negatively criticised for the same, as well as for asking that decorations, particularly those from the Second World War, not be worn at certain state events. He was further critiqued for remaining in such an important office despite his incapacitation. Still, he remained focused on the person and institution he represented, and was known to write to the Queen on a monthly basis. His official portrait was a first for including the viceregal consort, done to recognise Gabrielle&#x27;s contributions to her husband&#x27;s service.

== Post viceregal life ==
After leaving Rideau Hall, the Légers continued to live in Ottawa. Léger died on November 22, 1980, and was survived by his wife and daughter.

<text>Trois-Rivières (, ; ) is a city in the Mauricie administrative region of Quebec, Canada, at the confluence of the Saint-Maurice and Saint Lawrence rivers, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River across from the city of Bécancour. It is part of the densely populated Quebec City–Windsor Corridor and is approximately halfway between Montreal and Quebec City. Trois-Rivières is the economic and cultural hub of the Mauricie region. The settlement was founded by French colonists on July 4, 1634, as the second permanent settlement in New France, after Quebec City in 1608.

The name of Trois-Rivières, which dates from the end of the 16th century, was used by French explorers in reference to the three channels in the Saint-Maurice River formed at its mouth with the Saint Lawrence, as it is divided by two islands, Potherie (Île Caron) and Île Saint-Quentin. The city occupies a location near where Jacques Cartier, in a 1535 trip along the St. Lawrence, stopped to plant a cross on Saint-Quentin island. 

Trois-Rivières is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Trois-Rivières. Its geographical code is 371. Together with the regional county municipality of Les Chenaux, it forms the census division (CD) of Francheville (37). The municipalities within Les Chenaux and the former municipalities that were amalgamated into Trois-Rivières formerly constituted the regional county municipality of Francheville. Trois-Rivières is the seat of the judicial district of the same name.

==City name==
The city&#x27;s name, which is French for &#x27;three rivers&#x27;, is named for the fact the Saint-Maurice River has three mouths at the Saint Lawrence River, as it is divided by two islands in the river. 
The &quot;Trois-Rivières&quot; name was used for the first time in 1599 by Sieur François Gravé Du Pont, a geographer under Champlain, whose records confirmed the name in 1603. As Sieur Gravé Du Pont sailed upriver toward Montreal, he saw what appeared to be three separate tributaries. He did not know two large islands divide the course of the Saint-Maurice River in three parts where the latter flows into the St. Lawrence River.

Historically, in English this city was once known as Three Rivers. 
Since the late 20th century, when there has been more recognition of Quebec and French speakers, the city has generally been referred to as &quot;Trois-Rivières&quot; in both English and French. The anglicized name still appears in many areas of the town (e.g., the city&#x27;s Three Rivers Academy), bearing witness to the influence of English settlers in the town. The city&#x27;s inhabitants are known as &quot;Trifluviens&quot; (Trifluvians).

== History ==
For thousands of years, the area that would later become known as Trois-Rivières was frequented by indigenous peoples. The historic Algonquin and Abenaki peoples used it as a summer stopping place. They would fish and hunt here, as well as gather roots and nuts. The area was rich in resources. The French explorer Jacques Cartier described the site while on his second journey to the New World in 1535. 

The name &quot;Trois-Rivières&quot;, however, was not given until 1599, by Captain Dupont-Gravé, and first appeared on maps of the area dated 1601.

In 1603, while surveying the Saint-Lawrence River, Samuel de Champlain recommended establishing a permanent settlement in the area. The settlement grew into a village, officially formed on July 4, 1634, by its first governor, Sieur de Laviolette. Early inhabitants of Trois-Rivières included Quentin Moral, Sieur de St-Quentin; future governor Pierre Boucher de Grosbois, François Hertel de la Fresnière (father of Joseph-François Hertel de la Fresnière), François Marguerie, René Robineau, and Jean Sauvaget, and interpreter Jean Godefroy de Lintot, who married Marie, daughter of Michel Le Neuf.

Jacques Leneuf de La Poterie, who would become governor of Trois-Rivières, and acting governor of New France, and royal judge Michel Le Neuf du Hérisson, who would be acting governor of Trois-Rivières, brothers, arrived with their widowed mother, Jeanne Le Marchand, in 1636. The Le Neufs were accompanied by Jacques&#x27; wife, Marguerite, and her brothers, Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny and future governor Charles Legardeur de Tilly.

The city was the second to be founded in New France (after Quebec City, before Montreal). Given its strategic location, it played an important role in the colony and in the fur trade with First Nations peoples. The settlement became the seat of a regional Government of Trois-Rivières in 1665. Ursuline nuns first arrived at the settlement in 1697, where they founded the first school and helped local missionaries to Christianize the local indigenous people, developing a class of Métis people.

French sovereignty in Trois-Rivières continued until 1760, when the city was captured as part of the British conquest of Canada during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Sixteen years later, on June 8, 1776, it was the theatre of the Battle of Trois-Rivières (part of the ill-fated invasion of the province of Quebec by &quot;les Bostonnais&quot;, Americans from the Boston area) during the American Revolutionary War who arrived with the goal of weakening the British settlement.

Trois-Rivières continued to grow in importance throughout this period and beyond. In 1792 it was designated as the seat of a judicial district. In 1852, the Roman Catholic church made this the see of the Diocese of Trois-Rivières.

In 1816, Captain A.G. Douglas, a former adjutant at the British military college at Great Marlow, recommended a military college for Catholic and Protestant boys be established at Trois-Rivières. He proposed it operate in a disused government house and he would be superintendent. Douglas&#x27; college was intended as a boarding school to educate the young sons of officers, amongst others, in Latin, English, French, history, geography, drawing and mathematics. This preceded the founding of the Royal Military College of Canada in 1876.

In 1908, the greater part of the city of Trois-Rivières was destroyed by a fire; most of the city&#x27;s original buildings, many dating to the French colonial years, were destroyed. Among the surviving buildings were the Ursuline Monastery and the De Tonnancour Manor. As a result of the destruction, a major redesign and renovation of the city was undertaken, including the widening and renewal of many of the city&#x27;s roads. Many new businesses and industries became established in the town, attracting additional residents.

During the mid-century, the city became heavily industrialized and lost jobs during the later restructuring. In the 1960s, Trois-Rivières undertook a large-scale project of economic diversification, including founding several cultural institutions and attractions. The Old City of Trois-Rivières was declared an &quot;historic sector&quot; in 1964. The Laviolette Bridge, linking Trois-Rivières to Bécancour and the south shore of the Saint-Lawrence River, was opened officially on December 20, 1967. In 1969, the city founded the , known for its chiropractic school, its podiatric medical education, and its programs for primary and secondary school education.

Although historically an important centre of commerce, trade and population, Trois-Rivières has been superseded by the two major cities of Quebec: the metropolis of Montreal and the capital of Quebec City. It remains as one of the principal medium-sized cities of Quebec, along with Saguenay, Sherbrooke, and Gatineau.

== Geography ==
=== Islands ===
Saint-Quentin Island lies at the confluence of the Saint-Maurice River and St. Lawrence River, where the city of Trois-Rivières developed. With the islands &quot;Saint-Christophe&quot; and &quot;De La Poterie&quot;, it creates three channels at the mouth of the Saint-Maurice River, where it flows into St. Lawrence River. The island was named in honour of judge Quentin Moral, also said to be a fur trader and one of the first dealers on this island. It is now a centre of popular outdoor activities and relaxation at the heart of city. The patron saint of the island is Quentin de Rome.

It was first inhabited by an Algonquin tribe who cultivate corn in the lowlands of the river. On October 7, 1535, Jacques Cartier planted a cross on the island and proclaimed the sovereignty of France on this territory. A commemorative wrought iron cross was erected at the site associated with Cartier&#x27;s claim. The natural environment of Saint-Quentin has remained virtually unchanged. For nearly a century, it was not developed or cultivated.

Since 1930, the island has become more important as a destination for recreation. The island belonged at the time to Quebec Savings and Trust Company Limited and the Canada Power and Paper Corporation. The city bid for the land in 1933, but did not take ownership until November 3, 1947. During World War II, it was the site of a training camp for the Royal Canadian Navy. Services were gradually introduced in 1950.

The park and the beach on the island Saint-Quentin were officially inaugurated on June 24, 1962, in the presence of 5,000 people. There were more than 100 000 visitors that year. Since then, many facilities have been developed on the island, including a marina, a bike path, an interpretative trail, an ice rink, and camping ground. Several happenings and festivals are held annually on the island.

== Economy ==
Trois-Rivières is Canada&#x27;s oldest industrial city, with its first foundry established in 1738. The forge produced iron and cast for 150 years, much of it being shipped to France to be used in French navy ships. The first port facility was built in 1818 near rue Saint-Antoine, and today handles 2.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. The first railway was built in 1879 to support the growing lumber industry.

From the late 1920s until the early 1960s, the city was known as the pulp and paper industry capital of the world. The city once had five mills in operation (Trois-Rivières Ouest, Wayagamack, C.I.P., and St-Maurice Paper). Today, there are three mills left operating (Kruger Trois-Rivières Ouest, Kruger Wayagamack and Cascades Lupel ex-St-Maurice Paper); the closures resulted largely to a decline in newsprint demand and globalization. The closures were not limited to just the pulp and paper industry. Trois-Rivières had an industrial decline in the 1980s and 1990s, when several textile mills were closed after owners moved jobs offshore. Unemployment rose to 14 percent in the 1990s.

Trois-Rivières is attempting an industrial revitalization by establishing technology parks and taking advantage of its central location to both Montreal and Quebec City, its university and port. An example of the new economy is Marmen Incorporated, which manufactures wind turbine towers and employs 1,000 people between its operations in Trois-Rivières and Matane.

The city&#x27;s other prominent industries include metal transformation, electronics, thermoplastics, and cabinet making. An industrial park adjoining Trois-Rivières Airport serves also as a major centre for the aeronautical industry. Also, the production of food crops is still important to the economy.

== Arts and culture ==
Trois-Rivières hosts the FestiVoix de Trois-Rivières, a 10-day summer music festival which attracts in excess of 300,000 visitors annually. The city also hosts the Festival International de la Poésie – an international poetry festival – as well as the Festival International Danse Encore, and the MetalFest de Trois-Rivières every November. In 2009, Trois-Rivières was designated as the 2009 Cultural Capital of Canada for cities having a population of 125,000 or more.

Trois-Rivières is officially the &quot;Poetry Capital of Quebec&quot;. Numerous plaques displaying poetic verses are installed throughout the centre of the city. An International Festival of Poetry is held annually in the first week of October. 

== Attractions ==
=== Cityscape ===
The city&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Boulevard des Forges, an area several blocks long in the heart of the Old Town composed of century-old buildings housing a great variety of cafés, restaurants, clubs, bars, and shops. In the warmer months, the area is regularly closed to vehicular traffic to accommodate various festivals and events, turning the downtown core into a pedestrian mall.

Notable landmarks include the Forges du Saint-Maurice, a foundry dating back to the 1730s, the Ursulines Monastery, and Notre-Dame-du-Cap Basilica.

In professional ice hockey, the city is host to the ECHL&#x27;s Trois-Rivières Lions (farm team of the Montreal Canadiens) beginning with the 2021–22 season, and has had several teams in the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey, typically with home games at the Colisée de Trois-Rivières. The city is also the site of the only remaining pari-mutuel (wagering) harness racing track in Quebec, Hippodrome de Trois-Rivières, which operates live standardbred racing from May through October. In 2014, the hippodrome has resurrected the Prix d&#x27;Été, a once major Canadian race for four-year-old pacers that had been contested in Montreal until 1992.

== Infrastructure ==


Local bus service is provided by the Société de transport de Trois-Rivières. The Laviolette Bridge links Trois-Rivières to Bécancour of the Centre-du-Québec administrative region on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The Laviolette Bridge is the only bridge across the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City; therefore it provides an important connection between the north and south shores of the river. Known for its impressive structure, its elegant aesthetics, the bridge has become a major landmark of Trois-Rivières and the Mauricie region. Approximately 40,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day. An airport also serves the city. 

Passenger rail service was provided to Trois-Rivières station as recently as 1990, but was suspended as part of service cuts by Via Rail. However, in 2022 Via Rail proposed adding passenger rail service again to Trois-Rivières as part of its High Frequency Rail project that would link Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal and Québec City.

On April 8, 2014, during morning commute an SUV fell into a giant pothole in Trois-Rivières caused by heavy rain accumulation. Nobody was injured during the incident.

<doc id="247036" wikidata="Q3455090" url="?curid=247036" title="Seigneurial system of New France">
<text>The manorial system of New France, known as the seigneurial system (, ), was the semi-feudal system of land tenure used in the North American French colonial empire. Economic historians have attributed the wealth gap between Quebec and other parts of Canada in the 19th and early 20th century to the persistent adverse impact of the seigneurial system.

Both in nominal and legal terms, all French territorial claims in North America belonged to the French king. French monarchs did not impose feudal land tenure on New France, and the king&#x27;s actual attachment to these lands was virtually non-existent. Instead, landlords were allotted land holdings known as manors and presided over the French colonial agricultural system in North America.

Manorial land tenure was introduced to New France in 1628 by Cardinal Richelieu. Richelieu granted the newly formed Company of One Hundred Associates all lands between the Arctic Circle to the north, Florida to the south, Lake Superior in the west, and the Atlantic Ocean in the east. In exchange for this vast land grant and the exclusive trading rights tied to it, the Company was expected to bring two to three hundred settlers to New France in 1628, and a subsequent four thousand during the next fifteen years. To achieve this, the Company subinfeudated almost all of the land awarded to it by Cardinal Richelieu — that is, parceled it out into smaller units that were then run on a feudal-like basis and worked by &quot;habitants&quot;.

The lands were arranged in long narrow strips called &quot;seigneuries&quot; or fiefs along the banks of the St. Lawrence River, its estuaries, and other key transit features. This physical layout of manorial property developed as a means of maximizing ease of transit, commerce, and communication by using natural waterways (most notably, the St. Lawrence river) and the relatively few roads. A desirable plot had to be directly bordering or in very close proximity to a river system, which limited plot-expansion to one of two directions—left or right.

Despite the official arrangement reached between Cardinal Richelieu and the Company of One Hundred Associates, levels of migration to French colonies in North America remained extremely low. The resulting scarcity of labour had a profound effect on the system of land distribution and the &quot;habitant&quot;-seigneurial relationship that emerged in New France.

King Louis XIV instituted a condition on the land, stating that it could be forfeited unless it was cleared within a certain period of time. This condition kept the land from being sold by the &quot;seigneur&quot;, leading instead to its being sub-granted to peasant farmers, the &quot;habitants&quot;.

When a &quot;habitant&quot; was granted the title deed to a lot, he had to agree to accept a variety of annual charges and restrictions. Rent was the most important of these and could be set in money, produce or labour. Once this rent was set, it could not be altered, neither due to inflation nor time. A &quot;habitant&quot; was essentially free to develop his land as he wished, with only a few obligations to his &quot;seigneur&quot;. Likewise, a &quot;seigneur&quot; did not have many responsibilities towards his &quot;habitants&quot;. The &quot;seigneur&quot; was obligated to build a gristmill for his tenants, and they in turn were required to grind their grain there and provide the &quot;seigneur&quot; with one sack of flour out of every 14. The &quot;seigneur&quot; also had the right to a specific number of days of forced labour by the &quot;habitants&quot; and could claim rights over fishing, timber and common pastures.

Though the demands of the &quot;seigneurs&quot; became more significant at the end of French rule, they could never obtain enough resources from the rents and fees imposed on the &quot;habitants&quot; alone to become truly wealthy, nor leave their tenants in poverty. &quot;Habitants&quot; were free individuals; &quot;seigneurs&quot; simply owned a &quot;bundle of specific and limited rights over productive activity within that territory&quot;. The &quot;seigneur&quot;–&quot;habitant&quot; relationship was one where both parties were owners of the land, who split the attributes of ownership between them.

==Geographic characteristics==
Estates in free socage were the most macro-level of land division in New France but, within them, there existed several tenurial subdivisions. Immediately below the level of free socage was that of the villeinage (&quot;roture&quot;). Throughout New France, several thousand estates in villeinage were developed. Furthermore, these villein tenancies were remarkably uniform in terms of size. Barring extreme cases, it is estimated that around 95% of all villein estates were between in size, though most were likely 120 arpents or less. Estates of less than 40 square arpents were considered to be of little value by villein socagers.

To maximize simplicity when surveying, estates in villein socage were almost invariably distributed in rectangular plots following a rowed system, wherein the first row bordered the river, and was the first to be filled, followed by the second behind it and so on. Typically, the proportions of such rectangles coincided with the ratio of 1:10 for width and length, respectively. However, extremes all the way up to 1:100 are known to have occurred. This method of land division confers obvious advantages in terms of easy access to transportation and cheap surveying, but also allowed socagers to live remarkably close to families on neighboring plots—often within a few hundred yards—creating something of a proto-neighborhood.

Although legislation and enforcement varied depending on the period and administration, a socager&#x27;s rights of entitlement to their villeinage could not be revoked as long as they paid their duties and fees to the lord of the manor and satisfied the requirements of &quot;tenir feu et lieu&quot;. This stipulated that they were obliged to improve their landholdings or these would be confiscated. By ordinance of the Intendant in 1682, a socager could not hold more than two villeinages.

==Types of tenure==
The lord of the manor rented most of the land to tenants, known as &quot;censitaires&quot; or &quot;habitants&quot;, who cleared the land, built houses and other buildings, and farmed the land. A smaller portion of the land was kept as a demesne (land owned by the manorial lord and farmed by his family or by hired labour) which was economically significant in the early days of settlement, though less thereafter. Manorial land tenure in New France differed somewhat from its counterpart in France; the manorial lords of New France were not always nobles, though many were. Fiefs in North America were granted to military officers and – as in France – many were owned by the Catholic clergy. However, the system was feudal in the sense that there was a clear displacement of wealth happening from tenants to their landlords, which was not at all based on market forces (as land was plentiful and labor was not), but rather a system institutionalized by the crown.

Villein socagers were able to divide their land for their children according to the Custom of Paris once they had families of their own, meaning that in the event of the death of a spouse, half the estate went to the surviving spouse, with the other half divided among the children (both male and female). This could lead to an unusual (for the time period) number of women, generally widows, who were in charge of large amounts of property. However, it is also worth noting that most widows remarried within a short time of their spouse&#x27;s death and often the meticulous splitting of estates demanded by the Custom of Paris was disregarded in favor of quickly solidifying the new union.

In order to preserve each of the heirs&#x27; access to the river or road, the land would be divided lengthwise, resulting in narrower and narrower lots. In response to these increasingly subdivided farm plots and the issues of diminishing agricultural productivity associated with them, the Governor and the Intendant of New France petitioned the King in 1744 to issue a new ordinance rectifying the matter. The King responded by requiring the minimum plot size which a villein socager might cultivate or reside to be one arpent and a half of frontage by 30–40 arpents in depth. A final characteristic of villeinage is that the size of the fief typically varied in direct proportion with its distance from the nearest town, while its population density varied inversely.

Elsewhere this kind of property inheritance law often led to fragmentation of estates. However, the subsistence level farming of many of the villein socagers in New France made fragmentation impossible and so it was common practice for one heir to buy out the others&#x27; land, keeping estates in more or less one piece. It is also worth noting that anything but direct inheritance meant the property might be subject to the entry fine of 1/12th of the value of the property due to the lord.

===Economic impact on New France===
Some historians suggest that the structure of feudal land tenure itself might have caused delays in economic growth for New France. Morris Altman, for example, argued that by shifting disposable wealth and therefore spending power from the villein socagers to the manorial lords (crown vassals), the system deeply altered the economy of New France. Furthermore, since the manorial lords rarely had their estates as their chief source of income, the relatively insignificant sums of money from the feu-duties were used largely in the purchase of luxury items which were almost always imported from France. Altman theorizes that since the villein socagers would have either re-invested this money or bought goods produced locally, this limited growth and was damaging to the economy of New France. Though Altman later altered the precise estimates he made (based on annual outputs) of how much disposable income the socagers might have been deprived of (and therefore the amount of local investment lost), he confirmed his original thesis that the feudal fees reduced growth through wealth transfer. Other historians such as Allan Greer have also argued that the wealth transfer limited the growth of the villein socagers&#x27; farms as well as other local enterprises, which in the long run might limit general economic growth.
==After the British conquest==
After the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and the conquest of Quebec by the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the system became an obstacle to colonization by British settlers, not least because England had already abolished feudal land tenure under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. Nevertheless, the Quebec Act of 1774 retained French civil law and therefore the manorial system.

Manorial land tenure remained relatively intact for almost a century. This was the prime land; also many Englishmen and Scotsmen purchased manorial estates; others were divided equally between male and female offspring; some were run by the widows of manorial lords as their children grew to adulthood. Over time land became subdivided among the owners&#x27; offspring and descendants, resulting in increasingly narrow plots of land.

When Quebec was divided in December 1791 between Lower Canada (today&#x27;s Quebec) and Upper Canada (today&#x27;s Ontario), a segment of the colonial boundary was drawn at the west edge of the westernmost contiguous manorial estates along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, accounting for the small triangle of land at Vaudreuil-Soulanges that belongs to Quebec rather than Ontario. Only two outlying feudal manors were ever established in the area that became Upper Canada, being located at L&#x27;Original on the Ottawa River and Cataraqui at the eastern end of Lake Ontario at what is now Kingston and Wolfe Island. Tenure in the Upper Canada manors was converted into fee simple (freehold) under the &quot;Constitutional Act 1791&quot;.

==Abolition==
The British Parliament passed legislation in 1825 that provided for the commutation of manorial land tenure, upon the agreement of the lord of the manor and the tenants concerned. As no incentives were given, few such conversions took place. The Province of Canada also attempted to facilitate the process through passage of a further Act in 1845.

The manorial system was formally abolished through the passage of the &quot;Feudal Abolition Act 1854&quot; by the Parliament of the Province of Canada, which received royal assent on 18 December 1854. It provided for:

:* the conversion of all feudal tenure into that of allodial title
:* the abolition of all feu-duties and feudal incidents, to be replaced by a rentcharge (&quot;rente constituée&quot;) calculated under a specified formula
:* the determination of rights held by manorial lords and tenants through referral to a special Seigniorial Court
:* the redemption of rentcharges in certain circumstances, upon payment of a determined amount to the lord

After the required schedules for each manorial estate were published in 1859, the Parliament passed &quot;The Seigniorial Amendment Act of 1859&quot;, which provided for the commutation of all feu-duties and rents (other than those relating to &quot;cens et rentes&quot;) through payments to the lords from a fund appropriated for that purpose.

===Delay into the 20th century for commutation of rents===
Some of the vestiges of this system of landowning continued into the 20th century as some of the rentcharges continued to be collected as before on the traditional date of St. Martin&#x27;s Day.

The final steps towards actual abolition of the system of rentcharges took place under the government of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, when the cause was promoted by Télesphore-Damien Bouchard, the Liberal deputy and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He declared that &quot;a very large number of villein socagers have not yet redeemed for over the seventy years that they have been able to do so [since the passage of the 1854 law]&quot; and they must &quot;make an annual pilgrimage to pay [the dues], very often, to a stranger who has acquired rights originally belonging to our ancestral families&quot;.

In 1928, the &quot;Seigniories Act&quot; was amended to require the compilation of all information relating to dues and related capital by municipality. In 1935, the Legislature of Quebec passed the &quot;Seigniorial Rent Abolition Act&quot;, which aimed to &quot;facilitate the freeing of all lands or lots of land from rentcharges.&quot; It provided for:

:* the incorporation of all county municipalities and independent city and town municipalities in which manorial estates were located, as the &quot;Syndicat national du rachat des rentes seigneuriales&quot; (SNRRS) ().
:* the borrowing of money by the Syndicate, under provincial guarantee, in order to redeem all rentcharges.
:* the preparation of land registers (&quot;terriers&quot;) in each municipality showing the lands, owners, rents and capital amounts concerned.
:* the commutation of such rentcharges, upon the approval of the land registers by the municipal councils and their subsequent ratification by an Act of the Legislature, after which the funds borrowed by the Syndicate would be repaid through a special tax to be collected from the owners, which could be paid in a lump sum or over a period of up to 41 years.

===Final steps (1936–1970)===
It was contemplated that the manorial lords would receive their commutation payments by 11 November 1936, in consideration of the capital represented by the feu-duties to be collected. However, the work of the SNRRS was briefly on hiatus from 1936 to 1940 during the government of the Union Nationale. It was resumed by the new provincial Liberal government in 1940, after which the final feu-duties were paid in November 1940.

Compared to the situation of the short cadastre (survey) of 1854, it was determined that annuities owed amount to no more than 25% of the original amount owed by the villein socagers overall. Some had not been paid since the 19th century. To rectify the situation for once and all, the SNRRS issued an edict dated 15 September 1940 stating that whatever was due no later than 11 November of that year was to be paid directly to the manorial lord as before. Any amount owing after that date would be paid to the municipality.

The amounts paid to the various municipalities were unequal as they did not directly correspond with the boundaries of the former manors. Many municipalities allowed a lump sum payment of the amount owing, rather than impose a small annual tax over the 41 years as permitted. The final installment paid to the SNRRS by the municipalities was made eleven years earlier than planned, on 11 November 1970 instead of 11 November 1981, due to an apparently effective management of the system.

==Historical evidence==


Remnants of the manorial system can be seen today in maps and satellite imagery of Quebec, with the characteristic &quot;long lot&quot; or &quot;river lot&quot; land system still forming the basic shape of current farm fields and clearings, as well as being reflected in the historic county boundaries along the St. Lawrence River. This form of land use can also be seen in images of Louisiana, which also was founded as a French colony with somewhat similar agricultural patterns. Also, this form of land use can be seen along the Red River in southern Manitoba and along certain portions of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan near Batoche, where significant Metis and French-Canadian settlement occurred. It was also the pattern in the Illinois Country developed by the French east of the Mississippi River, as in Prairie du Rocher, Illinois. 

This system is also visible in the streets of Detroit, Michigan. The earliest streets were named after the owners of each farm, such as Livernois being named after the Livernois Family ribbon farm. In Monroe County, Michigan, land on the River Raisin just west of Monroe, south of Detroit, also clearly shows the seigneurial system of land tenure. Three townships, Monroe. Frenchtown, and Raisinville, are unique in Michigan, as having a boundary that does not align with a longitude, but instead is perpendicular to the River Raisin, and aligns with the, still existent, seigneurial system land boundaries. Vestiges of this system are seen in the payment of land tax. The seigneurial system landowners pay on 31 December for the year just over, while the rest of Michigan pays on 1 January for the year to come.

Vestiges of the former system still emerge from time to time. In February 2005, the Superior Court of Quebec issued an order cancelling mortgages that could still exist for feu-duties on a property that was once part of Beauport Manor, Four years later there was an announcement that a wind farm, consisting of 131 wind turbines, was to be developed there. In September 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a Superior Court ruling that private ownership of the bed of a lake and related fishing rights were not conferred by the terms of a 1674 deed of feoffment creating the Manor of La Petite-Nation.

The work of the SNRRS can be evaluated by reviewing the fonds given in 1975 by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (which looked after the SNRRS) to the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. These documents constitute an amount equal to 20.5 meters of textual records.

A comparable manorial system was the patroon system of heritable land established by the Dutch West India Company. The company granted feudal powers to the &quot;patroons&quot;, who paid for the transport of settlers in New Netherland. The system was not abolished by the British when they took possession of the Dutch holdings.

<text>Fumarioideae is a subfamily of the family Papaveraceae (the poppy family). It was formerly treated as a separate family, the Fumariaceae (the fumitory, fumewort or bleeding-heart family). It consists of about 575 species of herbaceous plants in 20 genera, native to the Northern Hemisphere and South Africa. The largest genus is &quot;Corydalis&quot; (with 470 species).

==Description==
===Flower shape===
Plants in the fumitory subfamily are easily recognised by their peculiar flowers with two dissimilar pairs of petals. One or both of the outer petals is usually spurred, and the inner petals are connected at tip.

There are two types of flowers. A given genus has one type or the other. &quot;Dicentra&quot; has flowers with two planes of symmetry, and &quot;Corydalis&quot; has flowers with one plane of symmetry (zygomorphic).

===Leaves===
Most species have compound leaves.

==Taxonomy==
The APG IV system of 2016 (unchanged from the earlier 1998 APG system, the 2003 APG II system, and the APG III system of 2009) includes the former family Fumariaceae within the Papaveraceae. The APG II system provided for its optional segregation as a separate family, but this option is not provided in the current APG IV system or the APG III system.

===Genera===
There are 20 genera:
*&quot;Potomacapnos&quot;

<text>The Swinburne University of Technology (or simply Swinburne) is a public research university in Melbourne, Australia. It is the modern descendant of the Eastern Suburbs Technical College established in 1908, renamed Swinburne Technical College in 1913 after its co-founders George and Ethel Swinburne. It has three campuses in metropolitan Melbourne: Hawthorn, where its main campus is located; Wantirna; and Croydon, as well the Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus in the East Malaysian state of Sarawak. It also offers courses online and through its partnered institutions in Australia and overseas.

The university offers study programs in commerce, healthcare, teacher education, law, engineering, aviation, architecture, the performing arts and various other fields including in the arts and sciences. It also offers Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) research programs and courses in vocational education.
==History==

The university began in 1908 as the community-owned Eastern Suburbs Technical College on John Street, Hawthorn, to provide further education to residents of Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs. George Swinburne MLA, with the backing of Premier Thomas Bent, was the driving force behind its establishment, and its most generous benefactor, hence the name of the university. By 1913, £10,111 had been spent on its establishment, of which £3,718 came from private donations (including £1,000 each from George and Ethel Swinburne), and the remainder from the government. The first director was the sculptor J. R. Tranthim-Fryer, who remained in the position until 1938.

In 1913 the institution was taken over by the State Government, and its name changed to Swinburne Technical College. It later became known as the Swinburne Institute of Technical and Further Education (TAFE), eventually shortened to Swinburne Institute of Technology.

In the late 1980s, the Outer Eastern University Planning Council advocated for a new university to be established in outer eastern Melbourne. The area had the second lowest university participation rate in Melbourne, after the Mornington Peninsula. Partially in response to this advocacy, in 1990 Swinburne established its &quot;Eastern Campus&quot; in Mooroolbark (sometimes described as Lilydale), on the site of the recently closed MDA Grammar School. However, students could not attend until 1992 due to council planning negotiation, and the campus was officially opened on 6 April 1992. By 1993, it was known as the &quot;Mooroolbark Campus&quot;.

The Dawkins reforms to Australian higher education in the early 1990s led to many tertiary colleges being merged or split-up, and many given university status.

On 1 January 1992, the university was given the Prahran Campus of Victoria College and the co-located Prahran College of TAFE, both of which had evolved from the Prahran Mechanics&#x27; Institute (established in 1854). Swinburne attained university status on 1 July 1992 with the passage of the &quot;Swinburne University of Technology Act 1992.
In 1997, Swinburne opened a campus at Lilydale, replacing its nearby one at Mooroolbark. In 1998, it merged with the Outer East Institute of TAFE and began operating from campuses at Croydon and Wantirna.

In 1999, Swinburne established the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA).

In 2000, the university opened a campus in Sarawak, Malaysia, as a partnership between the university and the Sarawak State Government: Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus.

In 2008, it collaborated with two other universities in forming The Centre for Social Impact. In February 2011, the university opened the Advanced Technologies Centre, a 22,000 square metre building of modern architectural design at its Hawthorn campus, known locally as &quot;the cheese grater building&quot;.

Following a series of funding cuts announced by the Victorian Government to vocational education in May 2012, Swinburne announced that it would close its Lilydale and Prahran campuses. Lilydale campus officially closed on 1 July 2013, and was taken over by Box Hill Institute in 2016. The university sold its Prahran campus to the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE in 2014. The site became the home of NICA, and in 2022 was acquired by the Victorian Government, along with Melbourne Polytechnic on the same site. NICA&#x27;s degrees have been administered by the university and this will continue until the end of 2025, when they will be transferred to the Australian College of the Arts (Collarts).

In 2015, Swinburne launched its law school. Through a partnership with Leo Cussen Centre for Law, Swinburne Law School is the only law school in Victoria accredited by the Victorian Legal Admissions Board (VLAB) to enable students to accelerate their admission to legal practice by completing their practical legal training during the final year of their studies.

===Swinburne Film and Television School===

The Swinburne Film and Television School, which offered the first tertiary course in filmmaking in the country, was founded in 1966 by filmmaker Brian Clark Robinson (1934–1991). Part of what was the Graphic Art School became Film and Television, led by Robinson. The first course offered, from 1966, was the Diploma of Art in Film and Television, which was the first such course to be offered in Australia. In 1967 it was known as the Film and Television course of the School of Art. In 1976, Swinburne formed a department of film and television, with Robinson was appointed its head. Swinburne introduced a Graduate Diploma in Applied Film and Television, offering film, television, and animation courses. This was highly successful, with most of the graduates being employed in the industry afterwards. By 1983, the school offered a three-year Diploma in Film an TV, for school-leavers, as well as the graduate diploma, with over 90% of graduates finding employment in the film and television industries. In 1987, when Robinson was appointed dean of the faculty of arts at the university, Jennifer Sabine became head of the school, but Robinson continued to teach scriptwriting.

In September 1991 Swinburne Film and Television School celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 1992, the ownership and management of the school was handed over to the Victorian College of the Arts, becoming the VCA Film and Television School. In 1996, Barbara Paterson published &quot;Renegades: Australia&#x27;s first film school: from Swinburne to VCA&quot;, based on her 1993 masters thesis, &quot;Portrait of a film school : the history of the Victorian College of the Arts School of Film and Television, formerly known as Swinburne Film and Television School&quot;.

 Swinburne School of Film and Television (SSFT) teaches filmmaking at Swinburne, and is a full member of CILECT (the International Association of Film and Television Schools).

==Structure and governance==
The university is governed by the &quot;Swinburne University of Technology Act 2010&quot;, by which the Governor of Victoria is its visitor. the vice-chancellor and president is Pascale Quester and the chancellor John Pollaers (appointed 2019). It is governed by the university council, run by the executive team, while the Academic Senate advises the council on the conduct and content of programs and courses.

There were 2,720 total members of staff as of 30 June 2023, and its budget was 834.13 million.

== Online education ==

The university&#x27;s online arm, Swinburne Online, was founded in 2011 after a 50-50 joint venture with SEEK Learning seeking to capitalise on increasing demand for off-campus education.

Swinburne Online was originally created under the name Swinburne Direct, with an initial $10 million investment. It was formed to maximise the Federal Government&#x27;s decision to lift caps on Commonwealth-supported university places from 2012, a policy which intended to increase the number of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor&#x27;s degrees to 40 per cent by 2025.

Swinburne Online originally provided higher education degrees at both bachelor and masters level. As of April 2015, it offered over twenty courses in business, communication, design, education, and social science. However, as of September 2015, Swinburne Online has begun offering vocational education.

In April 2015, CEO Denice Pitt expressed a public desire to expand internationally to offer degrees to international students.

In 2014 Swinburne Online was ranked fourth in Australia&#x27;s 100 fastest growing companies. Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew by 48% to $29.8 million in 2014–15.
