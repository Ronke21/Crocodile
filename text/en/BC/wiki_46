<text>Ranunculaceae (, buttercup or crowfoot family; Latin &quot;little frog&quot;, from &quot;frog&quot;) is a family of over 2,000 known species of flowering plants in 43 genera, distributed worldwide.

The largest genera are &quot;Ranunculus&quot; (600 species), &quot;Delphinium&quot; (365), &quot;Thalictrum&quot; (330), &quot;Clematis&quot; (380), and &quot;Aconitum&quot; (300).

== Description ==

Ranunculaceae are mostly herbaceous annuals or perennials, but some are woody climbers (such as &quot;Clematis&quot;) or shrubs (e.g. &quot;Xanthorhiza&quot;).

Most members of the family have bisexual flowers which can be showy or inconspicuous. Flowers are solitary, but are also found aggregated in cymes, panicles, or spikes. The flowers are usually radially symmetrical but are also found to be bilaterally symmetrical in the genera &quot;Aconitum&quot; and &quot;Delphinium&quot;. The sepals, petals, stamens and carpels are all generally free (not fused), the outer flower segments typically number four or five. The outer stamens may be modified to produce only nectar, as in Aquilegia, &quot;Helleborus&quot; and &quot;Delphinium&quot;.

In some genera, such as &quot;Thalictrum&quot;, the sepals are colorful and appear petal-like (petaloid) and the petals can be inconspicuous or absent. The stems are unarmed. The leaves are variable. Most species have both basal and cauline (stem) leaves, which are usually compound or lobed but can be simple. They are typically alternate, or occasionally opposite or even whorled. Many species, especially the perennials, form rhizomes that develop new roots each year. &quot;Ficaria verna&quot; can reproduce vegetatively by means of root tubers produced in the leaf axils. Some members of the genus &quot;Thalictrum&quot; utilize anemophily while others utilize entomophily. Flowers of the entomophilous genus &quot;Papaver&quot;, also of the &quot;Ranunculales&quot; order, produce only pollen. Until recently, it was believed that the species of the genus &quot;Anemone&quot; also lack nectar.

The fruits are most commonly free, unfused achenes (e.g. &quot;Ranunculus&quot;, &quot;Clematis&quot;) or follicles (e.g. &quot;Helleborus&quot;, &quot;Eranthis&quot;, &quot;Nigella&quot;), but a berry in &quot;Actaea&quot;.

=== Phytochemistry ===

Ranunculaceae contain protoanemonin, which is toxic to humans and animals. Contact with plant sap may cause inflammation and blistering of the skin, while ingestion can cause irritation of the mouth, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Other poisonous or toxic compounds, alkaloids and glycosides, are also common.

==Taxonomy==

Takhtajan (1997) included the Ranunculaceae as the only family in the Ranunculales which he placed in a subclass, the Ranunculidae, instead of a superorder. Previously, Thorn (1992) placed the Ranunculaceae in the Berberidales, an order within the Superorder Magnolianae. Earlier Cronquist in 1981 included the Ranunculaceae along with seven other families in the Rancunculales which was included in the Magnoliidae, which he regarded as a subclass. David, (2010) placed the Ranuculaceae, together with the Eupteleaceae, Lardizabalaceae, Menispermaceae, Berberidaceae, and Papaveraceae in the Ranunculales, the only order in the superorder Ranunculanae. This follows the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

The family Ranunculaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is one of seven families included in the order Ranunculales within the eudicots according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification. The family is monophyletic with &quot;Glaucidium&quot; as sister to the remaining genera. This phylogeny is illustrated in the APG Poster.

=== Subdivision ===

Early subdivisions of the family, such as Michel Adanson (1763), simply divided it based on one-seeded or many-seeded fruit. Prantl (1887) envisaged three tribes, Paeonieae, Helleboreae and Anemoneae with &quot;Paeonia&quot;, &quot;Glaucidium&quot; and &quot;Hydrastis&quot; forming Paeonieae. By the twentieth century Langlet (1932) used chromosome types to create two subfamilies, Ranunculoideae and Thalictroideae. In 1966, Tamura further developed Langlet&#x27;s system by adding floral characteristics with six subfamilies;
* Helleboroideae 
* Ranunculoideae
* Isopyroideae
* Thalictroideae
* Coptidoideae
* Hydrastidoideae

but by 1988 he had reduced Coptidoideae to a tribe within Isopyroideae, leaving five subfamilies, an arrangement he continued in his 1993 monograph, dividing the larger subfamilies into tribes, though by then &quot;Paeonia&quot; and &quot;Glaucidium&quot; were no longer considered to belong to Ranunculaceae. &quot;Paeonia&quot; was separated from Ranuculaceae and placed in its own family of Paeoniaceae (order Saxifragales). Other genera originally included in Ranunculaceae include &quot;Circaeaster,&quot; which was placed in its own family Circaeasteraceae.

Tamura&#x27;s complete system was structured as follows;
;Subfamilies and tribes
* Subfamily Ranunculoideae 
** Adonideae 
** Anemoneae 
** Ranunculeae 
* Subfamily Helleboroideae 
** Helleboreae 
** Cimicifugeae 
** Delphineae 
** Nigelleae 
* Subfamily Isopyroideae 
** Coptideae 
** Dichocarpeae 
** Isopyreae 
* Subfamily Thalictroideae
* Subfamily Hydrastidoideae

The genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot;, having been moved to its own family (Glaucidiaceae), has since been restored to Ranuculaceae.

=== Molecular phylogenetics ===

When subjected to molecular phylogenetic analysis, only Thalictroideae is monophyletic. The position of &quot;Glaucidium&quot; and some of its unique morphological characteristics prompted Stevens to suggest that it be given subfamilial rank as the monotypic Glaucidioideae. Similarly, &quot;Hydrastis&quot; has been assigned to subfamily Hydrastidoideae. Both genera are represented by a single species, &quot;Glaucidium palmatum&quot; and &quot;Hydrastis canadense&quot; respectively.

The relationships between the genera suggest the existence of three major clades corresponding to Coptidoideae, Thalictroideae (clade A) and Ranunculoideae (clade F). The latter is the largest with four subclades (B–E). Of these, C corresponds to Delphineae, D to Cimicifugae and E to Ranunculoideae. Consequently, Wang and colleagues (2009) proposed a new classification with five subfamilies, and further subdividing Ranunculoideae into ten tribes. The relationship between the subfamilies is shown in the cladogram (see below).

In addition to the two monotypic subgenera, Coptoideae has 17 species and Thalictroideae has 450, including &quot;Thalictrum&quot; and &quot;Aquilegia&quot;. The other genera (2025 species, 81% of the family) belong to Ranunculoideae. &quot;Kingdonia&quot; had been included by Tamura in Anemoneae, but is now added to Circaeasteraceae.

In recent years, researchers have used nuclear genes (obtained through transcriptome sequencing technology) to further investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Ranunculaceae family, and their findings are consistent with those of Wang and colleagues (2009). However, this study indicates that the ancestors of the Ranunculaceae family experienced multiple whole-genome duplication (WGD) events, which may be related to the longstanding prosperity of this ancient group.

=== Fossil record ===

Contrary to earlier data, there are no confirmed pre-Tertiary ranunculacean fossils. The Early Cretaceous &quot;Leefructus mirus&quot; from the Yixian Formation in China was described as belonging to the &quot;compare Family stem lineage to the Ranunculaceae&quot;. The oldest confirmed representative of the family is &quot;Paleoactaea nagelii&quot; Pigg &amp; DeVore described on the basis of fruits coming from the Upper Paleocene of North Dakota.

== Uses ==

Some Ranunculaceae are used as herbal medicines because of their alkaloids and glycosides, such as &quot;Hydrastis canadensis&quot; (goldenseal), whose root is used as a tonic. More than 30 species are used in homeopathy, including &quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;, &quot;Actaea racemosa&quot;, &quot;Clematis recta&quot;, &quot;Clematis virginiana&quot;, &quot;Hydrastis canadensis&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus bulbosus&quot;, &quot;Helleborus niger&quot;, &quot;Delphinium staphisagria&quot;, &quot;Pulsatilla nigricans&quot;. Many genera are well known as cultivated flowers, such as &quot;Aconitum&quot; (monkshood), &quot;Clematis&quot;, &quot;Consolida&quot; (larkspur), &quot;Delphinium&quot;, &quot;Helleborus&quot; (Christmas rose), &quot;Trollius&quot; (globeflower). The seeds of &quot;Nigella sativa&quot; are used as a spice in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine.

<text>Austrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas. The best-known species is &quot;Illicium verum&quot;, commonly known as star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade (Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales), which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants. Austrobaileyales is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside the ANA grade.

The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, &quot;Austrobaileya scandens&quot;, a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas.

== In different classifications ==
Until the early 21st century, the order was only rarely recognised by systems of classification (an exception is the Reveal system).

The APG system, of 1998, did not recognize such an order. The APG II system, of 2003, does accept this order and places it among the basal angiosperms, that is: it does not belong to any further clade. APG II uses this circumscription:

* order Austrobaileyales
** family Austrobaileyaceae, one species of woody vines from Australia
** family Schisandraceae [+ family Illiciaceae], several dozen species of woody plants, found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The best known of those is Star anise.
** family Trimeniaceae, half-a-dozen species of woody plants found in subtropical to tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and the Pacific Islands

Note: &quot;+ ...&quot;=optional segregate family, that may be split off from the preceding family. The Cronquist system, of 1981, also placed the plants in families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae together, but as separate families, united at the rank of order, in the order Illiciales.

<text>Illiciales is an order of flowering plants that is not recognized by the current most widely used system of plant classification, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group&#x27;s APG III system. The order was comprised differently in various systems of plant taxonomy, but is composed of 2-4 families of shrubs, trees, and lianas native to Australasia, south eastern Asia, and the southeastern United States. The families all contain species with essential oils, and flowers with a perianth with bracts (when present), sepals, and petals incompletely distinguished from each other and not arranged in definite whorls. The families of the order had been variably placed in other orders (Magnoliales, Austrobaileyales) in different taxonomies.

The Cronquist system, of 1981, recognized Illiciales as an order consisting of the families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae and placed it in the subclass Magnoliidae, in class Magnoliopsida (or dicotyledons) of division Magnoliophyta (or angiosperms).

The Dahlgren system also recognised the order and placed it in superorder Magnolianae, in subclass Magnoliideae (Dahlgren&#x27;s dicotyledons), in class Magnoliopsida with the same circumscription of families as the Chronquist system.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) does not recognize the order, initially leaving the family Illiciaceae unplaced as to order. In its second higher level taxonomy of angiosperms (APG II), the APG recognized &quot;Illicium&quot; and &quot;Schisandra&quot; as closely related taxa in the family Illiciaceae, and created the order Austrobaileyales with the families Illiciaceae, Trimeniaceae, and Austrobaileyaceae.

<text>A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which is a collection of one or more fields. Each field contains a single value, and the collection of fields in a record defines its type. One type of field is the link, which connects a given record to associated records. Using links, records link to other records, and to other records, forming a tree. An example is a &quot;customer&quot; record that has links to that customer&#x27;s &quot;orders&quot;, which in turn link to &quot;line_items&quot;.

The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have zero or more child records. The network model extends the hierarchical by allowing multiple parents and children. In order to retrieve data from these databases, the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node. Both models were well suited to data that was normally stored on tape drives, which had to move the tape from end to end in order to retrieve data.

When the relational database model emerged, one criticism of hierarchical database models was their close dependence on application-specific implementation. This limitation, along with the relational model&#x27;s ease of use, contributed to the popularity of relational databases, despite their initially lower performance in comparison with the existing network and hierarchical models.

== History ==
The hierarchical structure was developed by IBM in the 1960s and used in early mainframe DBMS. Records&#x27; relationships form a treelike model. This structure is simple but inflexible because the relationship is confined to a one-to-many relationship. The IBM Information Management System (IMS) and RDM Mobile are examples of a hierarchical database system with multiple hierarchies over the same data.

The hierarchical data model lost traction as Codd&#x27;s relational model became the de facto standard used by virtually all mainstream database management systems. A relational-database implementation of a hierarchical model was first discussed in published form in 1992 (see also nested set model). Hierarchical data organization schemes resurfaced with the advent of XML in the late 1990s (see also XML database). The hierarchical structure is used primarily today for storing geographic information and file systems.

Currently, hierarchical databases are still widely used especially in applications that require very high performance and availability such as banking, health care, and telecommunications. One of the most widely used commercial hierarchical databases is IMS.
Another example of the use of hierarchical databases is Windows Registry in the Microsoft Windows operating systems.

== Examples of hierarchical data represented as relational tables ==
An organization could store employee information in a table that contains attributes/columns such as employee number, first name, last name, and department number. The organization provides each employee with computer hardware as needed, but computer equipment may only be used by the employee to which it is assigned. The organization could store the computer hardware information in a separate table that includes each part&#x27;s serial number, type, and the employee that uses it. The tables might look like this:

In this model, the codice_1 data table represents the &quot;parent&quot; part of the hierarchy, while the codice_2 table represents the &quot;child&quot; part of the hierarchy.
In contrast to tree structures usually found in computer software algorithms, in this model the children point to the parents.
As shown, each employee may possess several pieces of computer equipment, but each individual piece of computer equipment may have only one employee owner.

Consider the following structure:
In this, the &quot;child&quot; is the same type as the &quot;parent&quot;. The hierarchy stating EmpNo 10 is boss of 20, and 30 and 40 each report to 20 is represented by the &quot;ReportsTo&quot; column. In Relational database terms, the ReportsTo column is a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column. If the &quot;child&quot; data type were different, it would be in a different table, but there would still be a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column of the employees table.

This simple model is commonly known as the adjacency list model and was introduced by Dr. Edgar F. Codd after initial criticisms surfaced that the relational model could not model hierarchical data. However, the model is only a special case of a general adjacency list for a graph.

<text>The New River Gorge Bridge is a steel arch bridge long over the New River Gorge near Fayetteville, West Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. With an arch long, the New River Gorge Bridge was the world&#x27;s longest single-span arch bridge for 26 years; it is now the fifth longest and the longest outside of China. Part of U.S. Route 19, its construction marked the completion of Corridor L of the Appalachian Development Highway System. An average of 16,200 motor vehicles cross the bridge each day.

The roadway of the New River Gorge Bridge is above the New River, making the bridge one of the highest vehicular bridges in the world; it is the third highest in the United States. When completed in 1977, it was the world&#x27;s highest bridge carrying a regular roadway, a title it held until the 2001 opening of the Liuguanghe Bridge in China. Because of its height, the bridge has attracted daredevils since its construction. It is now the centerpiece of the annual &quot;Bridge Day&quot;, during which hundreds of people, with appropriate equipment, are permitted to climb on or jump from the bridge. In 2005, the structure gained additional attention when the U.S. Mint issued the West Virginia state quarter with the bridge depicted on one side. In 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

Construction began on the bridge in June 1974, and was completed on October 22, 1977. The bridge was designed by the Michael Baker Company under the direction of Chief Engineer Clarence V. Knudsen and Corporate Bridge Engineer Frank J. Kempf, and executed by U.S. Steel&#x27;s American Bridge Division. The final cost of construction was $37 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars). It was approximately $4 million, or $ million in dollars, over bid. It is made from COR-TEN steel. The use of COR-TEN in construction presented several challenges; notable among them was ensuring that the weld points weathered at the same rate as the rest of the steel.

At the time, the bridge was the West Virginia Department of Highways&#x27; largest project in its history, important both in terms of its overall cost, and that the federal government provided 70 percent of the funding. Construction gave a boost to the state and local economy; completion improved transportation. The bridge cut the vehicle travel time from one side of the gorge to the other from about 45 minutes to 45 seconds.

On August 14, 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Even though it was not yet 50 years old, it was listed for its exceptional impact on local transportation and its engineering significance.

==Tourism==

The New River Gorge Bridge is within the National Park Service&#x27;s New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, which protects this portion of the New River Gorge. At the northern end of the bridge, the Park Service operates a visitor center; it has scenic overlooks and a staircase that descends part of the way into the gorge.

A steel catwalk two feet (60 cm) wide runs the full length of the bridge underneath the roadway. Originally built to facilitate inspections, the catwalk is open for guided, handicapped-accessible quarter-mile &quot;Bridge Walk&quot; tours; visitors use safety rigging.

Since its opening, the bridge has been the centerpiece of Fayette County&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Day,&quot; held the third Saturday of every October. This festival includes demonstrations of rappelling, ascending, and BASE jumping. Bungee jumping, however, has been banned during Bridge Day since 1993.

The bridge is closed to vehicular traffic during the festival. Prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, two of the bridge&#x27;s four lanes were open to traffic during the festivals. Since 2001, security concerns have caused the entire span to be closed to vehicles during these events.

The first person to jump off the New River Gorge Bridge was Burton Ervin, who lives in Cowen, West Virginia, and was a coal-mine foreman. Burton jumped on August 1, 1979, using a conventional parachute. Four BASE jumpers have died at the bridge, three of these during Bridge Day festivals.

Probably because of its height (and lack of barriers), the bridge has regularly attracted suicide jumpers.

<doc id="247079" wikidata="Q31305" url="?curid=247079" title="Mars bar">
<text>Mars, commonly known as Mars bar, is the name of two varieties of chocolate bar produced by Mars Inc. It was first manufactured in 1932 in Slough, England, by Forrest Mars Sr. The bar consists of caramel and nougat coated with milk chocolate.

An American version of the Mars bar was produced with nougat and toasted almonds covered in milk chocolate, and later also with caramel. The American version was discontinued in 2002, then revived in a slightly different form the following year under the name &quot;Snickers Almond&quot;.

== Versions ==
===UK and worldwide===

In most of the world, a Mars bar is a chocolate bar with nougat and caramel, coated with milk chocolate. In the United States, it is marketed as the Milky Way bar.

It was first manufactured in Slough, England under the Mars bar name in 1932 by Forrest Mars Sr., son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars. He modelled it after his father&#x27;s Milky Way bar, which was already popular in the US, adjusting the recipe to better suit European tastes. He had a staff of twelve people, and originally advertised it as using Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate couverture. The bar and the proportions of the main components have changed over the years. With minor variations, this version is sold worldwide, except for the US, and is packaged in a black wrapper with red gold-edged lettering. Three million Mars bars accompanied the British task force to the Falklands in 1982.

The Mars brand logo went through several changes. In 1932, the first logo had a black colour font and was tilted. In 1978, the logo was rebranded to being white and having a star on the side. In 1988, the Mars bar had gone through a significant change with its logo. At that time, the logo was given a more bombastic treatment, written with red thick font and golden outlier. This logo became the standard-form for future logos. The logo then changed again, in the early 2000s. This time the logo was given a much more modern and sleeker look. It was updated to have a more cursive appearance to it and has retained that appearance ever since.

The nougat was made lighter, the chocolate on top became thinner, and the overall weight of the bar was reduced slightly. The slogan &quot;Pleasure you can&#x27;t measure&quot; was intended to appeal more to women and youths.

Various sizes are made. As of 2008: miniature bars called &quot;Fun Size&quot; () and &quot;Snack Time&quot; () (both sold in multiple packs); a larger multi-pack size of ; the regular-sized single bar, and a &quot;king-size&quot; bar, since replaced by &quot;Mars Duo&quot; (), a pack of two bars. The regular single bar contains 260 calories.

In the second half of 2008, Mars UK reduced the weight of regular bars from to . Although the reduction in size was not publicised at the time, Mars claimed the change was designed to help tackle the obesity crisis in the UK, but later acknowledged that the real reason for the change was rising costs. In 2013, the &quot;standard&quot; Mars bar was further reduced to , for a reduction of about 20% in 5 years; it continued to be in 2023.

In May 2009, the Mars bar size reduced from to in Australia, citing portion sizes and the obesity debate as the primary driver. By 2022 it was noted the Mars bar size had been reduced further to in Australia and New Zealand.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Mars bar was a candy bar with nougat and toasted almonds coated with milk chocolate. The same candy bar is known outside the United States as a Mars Almond bar. Originally it did not have caramel, but at some point caramel was added. It was discontinued in 2002.

In 2003, the company introduced a replacement called Snickers Almond containing nougat, almonds, caramel, and a milk chocolate coating, It is similar to the Mars bar, with some differences; for example, the pieces of almond are smaller in Snickers Almond than in the Mars bar.

The Mars bar was relaunched in January 2010 (initially exclusively through Walmart stores), discontinued again at the end of 2011, and relaunched again in September 2016 by Ethel M, the gourmet chocolate subsidiary of Mars, Inc. The 2016 version was the &quot;original American recipe&quot;, without caramel. It was available in their stores and on Amazon.com.

The European or Canadian version of the Mars bar is sold in some American grocery stores that stock imported food products.

== Custom packaging ==

The Original Mars bar in &quot;Believe&quot; packaging was sold in the UK from 18 April 2006 until the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in July. &quot;Believe&quot; took prominence on the packaging (&quot;Original Mars&quot; appeared in smaller print) to indicate support for the England national football team. Advertising in other nations of the UK was tailored to reflect their own teams after public condemnation, although in Scotland the &quot;Believe&quot; packaging was still used – causing negative publicity.

On 30 July 2008, the Tasmanian government announced that it had secured a major sponsor, Mars for a bid to enter the Australian Football League in a deal worth $4 million over 3 years and will temporarily change the name of its top-selling chocolate bar in Australia to Believe, to help promote Tasmania&#x27;s cause.

Mars were re-branded &quot;Hopp&quot; (&quot;Go!&quot; in English) in Switzerland during UEFA Euro 2008. Like the &quot;Believe&quot; packaging sold in the UK in 2006, &quot;Original Mars&quot; was also shown in smaller print.

In 2010, to promote England&#x27;s involvement in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the background of the UK Mars packaging became the St. George cross.

== Deep-fried Mars bar ==
First reports of Mars bars coated with batter and deep-fried being sold in Stonehaven, Scotland date back to 1995. Mars says that it is &quot;not authorised or endorsed&quot;.

Deep-fried Mars bars were also sold in New York.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, momo dumplings in tourist areas have used Mars bars as an unusual filling.

== Recalls ==
In July 2005, Mars bars, along with the Snickers bar, were recalled due to an anonymous extortion attempt against Star City Casino in Sydney. The extortionist claimed to have poisoned seven Mars and Snickers bars at random stores in New South Wales. As a result, Masterfoods Corporation, the company that manufactures Mars bars in Australia, recalled the entire Mars and Snickers product from store shelves in New South Wales. In the later half of August 2005, the threat to the public was deemed negligible and the bars returned to shelves.

In February 2016, Mars, Snickers and various other Mars, Inc. chocolate products were recalled in 55 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The precautionary recall was issued after a customer found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar purchased in Germany. The error was traced back to a Mars, Inc. factory in Veghel, The Netherlands.

== Animal products controversy ==
In May 2007, Mars UK announced that Mars bars, along with many of their other products such as Snickers, Maltesers, Minstrels and Twix would no longer be suitable for vegetarians because of the introduction of rennet, a chemical sourced from calves&#x27; stomachs used in the production of whey. Rabbinical authorities declared that the products remained kosher for Jewish consumption.

The decision was condemned by several groups, with the Vegetarian Society stating that &quot;at a time when more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food, Mars&#x27; decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step&quot;.

Mars later abandoned these plans, stating that it became &quot;very clear, very quickly&quot; that it had made a mistake.

== Economics ==
It has been observed on several occasions that the price of a Mars bar correlates fairly accurately with the change in value of the pound sterling since World War II, much in the way that the Big Mac Index has proven to be a good indicator of the actual relative purchasing power of world currencies.

== Popular culture ==
Northern Irish pop-punk band The Undertones wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Mars Bars&quot;, released as a B-side in 1979.

1960s Liverpool band Gerry and the Pacemakers were originally known as Gerry Marsden and the Mars Bars before changing their name due to the objection of the Mars company.

The 1990 Newbery Medal winning novel &quot;Maniac Magee&quot; includes a character nicknamed &quot;Mars Bar&quot; Thompson for his habit of eating Mars Bars.

<doc id="247080" wikidata="Q2268051" url="?curid=247080" title="The Comic Strip">
<text>The Comic Strip are a group of British comedians who came to prominence in the 1980s. They are known for their television series The Comic Strip Presents..., which was labelled as a pioneering example of the alternative comedy scene. The core members are Adrian Edmondson, Dawn French, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson and Jennifer Saunders, with appearances by Keith Allen, Robbie Coltrane, Alexei Sayle and others.

==Early history==
Two double acts, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall under the name 20th Century Coyote and Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson as The Outer Limits, started performing at the newly opened Comedy Store in London in 1980, alongside compere Alexei Sayle who had been resident there since the Comedy Store opened in 1979. Concurrently Richardson searched for a venue to mount a play he had produced with Michael White. He planned to run the Comic Strip late at night after the play&#x27;s performances. He sourced the Raymond Revuebar in Soho, but realising it was unsuitable for a theatrical production and running out of enthusiasm for the play, he decided to continue with the idea of a cabaret night. He persuaded the double acts and Sayle to move from the Comedy Store along with Arnold Brown, an older stand-up comic who did not fit so obviously into the alternative comedy scene. Sayle again resumed his compere duties and decided the running order, with Richardson having behind-the-scenes control. Richardson put out an advert for female performers which was answered by French and Saunders.

Richardson prompted members to sign a contract to signify their attachment to the group. The Comic Strip opened at the Revuebar&#x27;s Boulevard Theatre on 7 October 1980 and ran until 1981, when the troupe went on a national tour and then a tour of Australia. While the performers gained more exposure, actors such as Jack Nicholson and Robin Williams turned up to watch. A half-hour television documentary about the Comic Strip was broadcast in 1981.

Richardson approached producer Mike Bolland, the newly appointed Channel 4 youth-and-entertainment commissioning editor to propose a series of Comic Strip films for the channel. Bolland agreed to his proposal, his first commission for the station and Jeremy Isaacs quickly approved the budget. Richardson negotiated a deal with the channel for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as actors rather than standup performers. Almost simultaneously, the BBC signed Edmondson, Mayall, Planer, and Sayle to star in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, a sitcom in the same anarchic style as the Comic Strip. Richardson was initially to have played the role of Mike (ultimately given to Christopher Ryan), but did not, the result of differences with the show&#x27;s producer, Paul Jackson.

==Television==

===&quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot;===

&quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; debuted on 2 November 1982, the opening night of Channel 4. Each episode was prefixed by an animated lead-in consisting of the words &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; accompanied by a soundtrack consisting of a drum machine and a Farfisa organ rendition of &quot;Quando quando quando&quot;, together with a bomb labelled &quot;Have a nice day&quot;, falling towards a map. In the early episodes the map was of a section of north Dorset and southern Wiltshire, centred on the town of Shaftesbury.

The first episode was &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot;, a parody of the Famous Five. It was written by Peter Richardson and Pete Richens, who wrote most of the early episodes. &quot;Five Go Mad...&quot; drew anger from some viewers for the way it mercilessly satirised a children&#x27;s classic, although the Enid Blyton estate had given permission for the broadcast. A meeting was called to discuss the group&#x27;s future with Channel 4, after complaints from viewers.

The final episode of the first series was to have been a spoof chat show called &quot;Back to Normal with Eddie Monsoon&quot; (referred to as &quot;An Evening with Eddie Monsoon&quot; by some sources). It was never produced, as it was considered too vulgar even for the &quot;alternative&quot; Channel 4, and contained material that was possibly libellous. The script—which, uniquely for the Comic Strip, was written as a collaboration by the entire cast—was later published, along with the rest of the series, in book form.

A second series of seven episodes followed in 1983–84, including &quot;Five Go Mad on Mescalin&quot;, a sequel to the first episode, and the newly written &quot;Eddie Monsoon – A Life?&quot;, a spoof documentary on the life and times of the title character, an obscene, drunken television host (played by Adrian Edmondson). Michael White, the theatre impresario and &quot;Rocky Horror Show&quot; producer who had been brought in by Richardson as executive producer on the series, appeared in this episode as Monsoon&#x27;s producer, who had been responsible for axing Eddie&#x27;s television comeback show—called &quot;Back to Normal with Eddie Monsoon&quot;. The reasons given for the cancellation (e.g. &quot;the things you said about Burt Reynolds&quot;) are presumably the same problems that led to the real &quot;Back to Normal...&quot; being dropped by Channel 4. (The name Eddie Monsoon—a corruption of &quot;Edmondson&quot;—was later used by Jennifer Saunders, core member and Adrian Edmondson&#x27;s wife, for her character in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;.) &quot;A Fistful of Travellers&#x27; Cheques&quot; was the first episode to be filmed outside the United Kingdom, being made on location in and around San José, Andalusia, Spain, using some of the same locations as &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; which it spoofs.

Two one-off episodes were aired on Channel 4 over Christmas 1985, reflecting the tight schedules of the group. &quot;Consuela&quot; was a French and Saunders-led pastiche of the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), with French&#x27;s eponymous crazed housekeeper taking centre stage. The second episode, &quot;Private Enterprise&quot;, was the tale of a music business rip-off, where Peter Richardson steals a studio recording session tape and passes the results off as his own work.

The group made two feature films—&quot;The Supergrass&quot; (1985) and &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; (1987) as well as three one-off &quot;Comic Strip Presents...&quot; episodes which were the next to be screened on Channel 4. The first of these, &quot;The Bullshitters&quot;, was a parody of television spy and detective shows such as &quot;The Professionals&quot;. It was not broadcast under the Comic Strip name, partly because of the original group only Richardson appears (he is the only performer to appear in every single episode), and partly because co-star and co-writer Keith Allen did not want to be so closely associated with the group.

The third series was broadcast in 1988, and some episodes had longer running times, mostly around 50 minutes. Five of the six episodes (all except &quot;Funseekers&quot;) were given a limited theatrical release. They included &quot;The Strike&quot;, which won the Golden Rose of Montreux; &quot;More Bad News&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Bad News Tour&quot; showing the band reforming after five years to play at Castle Donington; and &quot;Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door&quot;, written by Mayall and Edmondson in the violent style of their sitcoms &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot; and &quot;Bottom&quot;, which featured Peter Cook as a psychotic contract killer (the eponymous Mr. Jolly) and Nicholas Parsons. Peter Richardson and Pete Richens only contributed one episode to the third series, allowing cast members such as Planer and Sayle to get their ideas on screen.

By then, the show had proved a hit, and some big names appeared in later productions, including Leslie Phillips, Miranda Richardson, Lionel Jeffries, Nicholas Parsons, Peter Capaldi, Hugh Cornwell, Kate Bush, Richard Vernon, Ruby Wax, Graham Crowden, Paul McCartney, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, Elvis Costello, and Benjamin Zephaniah (as a Rastafarian police van driver), and several musical acts, particularly from the &quot;Bad News&quot; series which was also aided by Queen guitarist Brian May, such as Def Leppard and Marillion.

===BBC and after===
In 1990, the series transferred to BBC2. By now, all the regulars (with the exception of Peter Richardson) had become more famous for their own shows, and more recurring performers such as Gary Beadle, Phil Cornwell, Steve O&#x27;Donnell, Mark Caven, Sara Stockbridge, and Doon Mackichan were brought in. Rik Mayall was contracted to ITV&#x27;s &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, and was only able to appear in two of the BBC productions (&quot;&quot;, and the Comic Relief special &quot;Red Nose of Courage&quot;). Richardson and Richens took over the bulk of the writing again, and Richardson also took over as director, having previously directed the two feature films, as well as &quot;The Strike&quot;. The six-part 1990 series was followed by three individual specials in 1992, and a final six episodes in 1993.

===Return to Channel 4===
In 1998, the original team reunited and returned to Channel 4 for the first time since 1988, for a one-off special, &quot;Four Men in a Car&quot;. This was followed in 2000 by a sequel, &quot;Four Men in a Plane&quot;. After a five-and-a-half-year hiatus, another 60-minute one-off special, &quot;Sex Actually&quot; (a parody of the 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot;), was made in 2005. It starred Sheridan Smith (&quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps&quot;) and Tamer Hassan (&quot;Layer Cake&quot;) alongside several of the regular cast members. &quot;Four Men in a Car&quot; was notable for being the first broadcast, on either television or radio, to involve Rik Mayall since his quad bike accident. Permission was thus given by Mayall&#x27;s family to show the special.

Peter Richardson, who has built his career as a writer-director with the TV series &quot;Stella Street&quot; and films such as &quot;&quot;, has not ruled out the possibility of a whole new series of &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; featuring younger cast members.

In June 2011, a casting call went out for a new hour-long episode, starring most of the original team. This was followed by an announcement that the Comic Strip was to produce a one-off special entitled &quot;The Hunt for Tony Blair&quot;, starring Stephen Mangan as Blair and Robbie Coltrane as Inspector Hutton. The one-off show included Jennifer Saunders (as Margaret Thatcher), as well as Harry Enfield, Rik Mayall, and a host of others.

===The move to Gold===
As of 2009, the archive of Channel 4 episodes has been broadcast on UKTV&#x27;s flagship channel, Gold. In May 2010, it was announced that Gold would broadcast a 30th-anniversary documentary, preceded by the next new scripted episode of the series, &quot;Five Go to Rehab&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot; which featured the entire original cast (Ade Edmondson, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Peter Richardson, as well as Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Stephen Mangan and Robbie Coltrane) and was filmed in the first weeks of July 2012, in and around Totnes; Richardson wrote and directed the film. The film showcased the characters thirty years on trying to recapture their youth. The film broadcast on Gold 7 November 2012.

In addition, a documentary broadcast 3 November 2012, &quot;30 Years of Comic Strip&quot;, detailed the filming and reception of several Comic Strip episodes including both original &quot;Five Go Mad&quot; episodes, &quot;The Strike&quot; and its semi-sequel &quot;GLC: The Carnage Continues&quot;, &quot;A Fistful of Travellers&#x27; Cheques&quot;, &quot;The Bullshitters&quot;/&quot;Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Bad News Tour&quot;/&quot;More Bad News&quot;, and &quot;The Hunt for Tony Blair&quot;. For &quot;A Fistful of Travellers&#x27; Cheques&quot;, a short sequel was made and broadcast in several parts, showing the two main characters reuniting, despite the ending of the original episode; unshown scenes of the original episode were also aired for the first time. For the Bad News aspect of the documentary, Planer and Richardson dressed up as their respective characters Den Dennis and Spider Webb, recalling their time as Bad News. Some of the telling of the Bad News story was real, due to their real-life signing to EMI; and some fictional, such as the scenes from &quot;More Bad News&quot; detailing the recording of their debut album. A lot of the original cast were interviewed for the documentary, alongside other people involved with the series at some point such as James Buckley and Stephen Mangan. As Gold, in its current format at least, has never screened the BBC&#x27;s &quot;GLC&quot;, &quot;...Nervous Breakdown&quot;, or Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt for Tony Blair&quot;, these were the first time clips from these episodes were aired on the channel.

In May 2018, a two-hour documentary history produced by Sean Doherty aired on Gold titled &quot;How the Young Ones Changed Comedy&quot;. It combined archive footage with revelations from many of the stars involved – such as Planer, Alexei Sayle, John Lloyd, Paul Jackson, and Lise Mayer – while later comedians discussed &quot;The Young Ones&quot;″ impact on British comedy generally.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; originally ran for three series and one special on Channel 4 from 1982 to 1988. Two series and three specials subsequently aired on BBC2 between 1990 and 1993. Since then, specials have aired sporadically on Channel 4, beginning in 1998 and most recently in 2016. The collective also created four theatrical films between 1985 and 2004. There have been a total of 42 television episodes, four feature films, and one short film.

<text>A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment, and often employed for rituals and rites. Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes, as well as in the performing arts and for entertainment. They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer&#x27;s body.

In art history, especially sculpture, &quot;mask&quot; is the term for a face without a body that is not modelled in the round (which would make it a &quot;head&quot;), but for example appears in low relief.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;mask&quot; appeared in English in the 1530s, from Middle French &quot;masque&quot; &quot;covering to hide or guard the face&quot;, derived in turn from Italian &quot;maschera&quot;, from Medieval Latin &quot;masca&quot; &quot;mask, specter, nightmare&quot;. This word is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Arabic &quot;maskharah&quot; مَسْخَرَۃٌ &quot;buffoon&quot;, from the verb &quot;sakhira&quot; &quot;to ridicule&quot;. However, it may also come from Provençal &quot;mascarar&quot; &quot;to black (the face)&quot; (or the related Catalan &quot;mascarar&quot;, Old French &quot;mascurer&quot;). This in turn is of uncertain origin – perhaps from a Germanic source akin to English &quot;mesh&quot;, but perhaps from &quot;mask-&quot; &quot;black&quot;, a borrowing from a pre-Indo-European language. One German author claims the word &quot;mask&quot; is originally derived from the Spanish &quot;más que la cara&quot; (literally, &quot;more than the face&quot; or &quot;added face&quot;), which evolved to &quot;máscara&quot;, while the Arabic &quot;maskharat&quot; – referring to the buffoonery which is possible only by disguising the face – would be based on these Spanish roots. Other related forms are Hebrew &quot;masecha&quot;= &quot;mask&quot;; Arabic &quot;maskhara&quot; مَسْخَرَ = &quot;he ridiculed, he mocked&quot;, &quot;masakha&quot; مَسَخَ = &quot;he transfomed&quot; (transitive).

==History==
The use of masks in rituals or ceremonies is a very ancient human practice across the world, although masks can also be worn for protection, in hunting, in sports, in feasts, or in wars – or simply used as ornamentation. Some ceremonial or decorative masks were not designed to be worn. Although the religious use of masks has waned, masks are used sometimes in drama therapy or psychotherapy.

One of the challenges in anthropology is finding the precise derivation of human culture and early activities, the invention and use of the mask is only one area of unsolved inquiry. The use of masks dates back several millennia. It is conjectured that the first masks may have been used by primitive people to associate the wearer with some kind of unimpeachable authority, such as a deity, or to otherwise lend credence to the person&#x27;s claim on a given social role.

The earliest known anthropomorphic artwork is circa 30,000–40,000 years old. The use of masks is demonstrated graphically at some of these sites. Insofar as masks involved the use of war-paint, leather, vegetative material, or wooden material, such masks failed to be preserved, however, they are visible in paleolithic cave drawings, of which dozens have been preserved. At the neanderthal Roche-Cotard site in France, a flintstone likeness of a face was found that is approximately 35,000 years old, but it is not clear whether it was intended as a mask.

In the Greek bacchanalia and the Dionysus cult, which involved the use of masks, the ordinary controls on behaviour were temporarily suspended, and people cavorted in merry revelry outside their ordinary rank or status. René Guénon claims that in the Roman saturnalia festivals, the ordinary roles were often inverted. Sometimes a slave or a criminal was temporarily granted the insignia and status of royalty, only to be killed after the festival ended. The Carnival of Venice, in which all are equal behind their masks, dates back to 1268 AD. The use of carnivalesque masks in the Jewish Purim festivities probably originated in the late 15th century, although some Jewish authors claim it has always been part of Judaic tradition.

The North American Iroquois tribes used masks for healing purposes (see False Face Society). In the Himalayas, masks functioned above all as mediators of supernatural forces. Yup&#x27;ik masks could be small finger masks, but also masks hung from the ceiling or carried by several people. Masks have been created with plastic surgery for mutilated soldiers.

Masks in various forms – sacred, practical, or playful – have played a crucial historical role in the development of understandings about &quot;what it means to be human&quot;, because they permit the imaginative experience of &quot;what it is like&quot; to be transformed into a different identity (or to affirm an existing social or spiritual identity). Not all cultures have known the use of masks, but most of them have.

==Masks in performance==

Throughout the world, masks are used for their expressive power as a feature of masked performance – both ritually and in various theatre traditions. The ritual and theatrical definitions of mask use frequently overlap and merge but still provide a useful basis for categorisation. The image of juxtaposed comedy and tragedy masks are widely used to represent the performing arts, and specifically drama.

In many dramatic traditions including the theatre of ancient Greece, the classical noh drama of Japan (14th century to present), the traditional lhamo drama of Tibet, talchum in Korea, and the topeng dance of Indonesia, masks were or are typically worn by all the performers, with several different types of mask used for different types of character.

In Ancient Rome, the word &quot;persona&quot; meant &#x27;a mask&#x27;; it also referred to an individual who had full Roman citizenship. A citizen could demonstrate his or her lineage through &quot;imagines&quot; – death masks of ancestors. These were wax casts kept in a &quot;lararium&quot; (the family shrine). Rites of passage, such as initiation of young members of the family or funerals, were carried out at the shrine under the watch of the ancestral masks. At funerals, professional actors would wear these masks to perform deeds of the lives of the ancestors, thus linking the role of mask as a ritual object and in theatre.

Masks are a familiar and vivid element in many folk and traditional pageants, ceremonies, rituals, and festivals, and are often of an ancient origin. The mask is normally a part of a costume that adorns the whole body and embodies a tradition important to the religious and/or social life of the community as whole or a particular group within the community. Masks are used almost universally and maintain their power and mystery both for their wearers and their audience. The continued popularity of wearing masks at carnival, and for children at parties and for festivals such as Halloween are good examples. Nowadays these are usually mass-produced plastic masks, often associated with popular films, television programmes, or cartoon characters – they are, however, reminders of the enduring power of pretense and play and the power and appeal of masks.

== Ritual masks ==
Ritual masks occur throughout the world, and although they tend to share many characteristics, highly distinctive forms have developed. The function of the masks may be magical or religious; they may appear in rites of passage or as a make-up for a form of theatre. Equally masks may disguise a penitent or preside over important ceremonies; they may help mediate with spirits, or offer a protective role to the members of a society who use their powers. Biologist Jeremy Griffith has suggested that ritual masks, as representations of the human face, are extremely revealing of the two fundamental aspects of the human psychological condition: firstly, the repression of a cooperative, instinctive self or soul; and secondly, the extremely angry state of the unjustly condemned conscious thinking egocentric intellect.

In parts of Australia, giant totem masks cover the body.

===Africa===
There are a wide variety of masks used in Africa. In West Africa, masks are used in masquerades that form part of religious ceremonies enacted to communicate with spirits and ancestors. Examples are the masquerades of the Yoruba, Igbo, and Edo cultures, including Egungun Masquerades and Northern Edo Masquerades. The masks are usually carved with an extraordinary skill and variety by artists who will usually have received their training as an apprentice to a master carver – frequently it is a tradition that has been passed down within a family through many generations. Such an artist holds a respected position in tribal society because of the work that he or she creates, embodying not only complex craft techniques but also spiritual/social and symbolic knowledge. African masks are also used in the Mas or Masquerade of the Caribbean Carnival.

Djolé (also known as Jolé or Yolé) is a mask-dance from Temine people in Sierra Leone. Males wear the mask, although it does depict a female.
Many African masks represent animals. Some African tribes believe that the animal masks can help them communicate with the spirits who live in forests or open savannas. People of Burkina Faso known as the Bwa and Nuna call to the spirit to stop destruction. The Dogon of Mali have complex religions that also have animal masks. Their three main cults use seventy-eight different types of masks. Most of the ceremonies of the Dogon culture are secret, although the antelope dance is shown to non-Dogons. The antelope masks are rough rectangular boxes with several horns coming out of the top. The Dogons are expert agriculturists and the antelope symbolizes a hard-working farmer.

Another culture that has a very rich agricultural tradition is the Bamana people of Mali. The antelope (called Chiwara) is believed to have taught man the secrets of agriculture. Although the Dogons and Bamana people both believe the antelope symbolises agriculture, they interpret elements the masks differently. To the Bamana people, swords represent the sprouting of grain.

Masks may also indicate a culture&#x27;s ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped eyes and a narrow chin. The raised strip running from both sides of the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represents the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the fact that the masks represent women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia&#x27;s Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.

The Senoufo people of the Ivory Coast represent tranquility by making masks with eyes half-shut and lines drawn near the mouth. The Temne of Sierra Leone use masks with small eyes and mouths to represent humility and humbleness. They represent wisdom by making bulging forehead. Other masks that have exaggerated long faces and broad foreheads symbolize the soberness of one&#x27;s duty that comes with power. War masks are also popular. The Grebo of the Ivory Coast and Liberia carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the straight nose to represent unwillingness to retreat.
Today, the qualities of African art are beginning to be more understood and appreciated. However, most African masks are now being produced for the tourist trade. Although they often show skilled craftsmanship, they nearly always lack the spiritual character of the traditional tribal masks.

===Oceania===
The variety and beauty of the masks of Melanesia are almost as highly developed as in Africa. It is a culture where ancestor worship is dominant and religious ceremonies are devoted to ancestors. Inevitably, many of the mask types relate to use in these ceremonies and are linked with the activities of secret societies. The mask is regarded as an instrument of revelation, giving form to the sacred. This is often accomplished by linking the mask to an ancestral presence, and thus bringing the past into the present.

As a culture of scattered islands and peninsulars, Melanesian mask forms have developed in a highly diversified fashion, with a great deal of variety in their construction and aesthetic. In Papua New Guinea, six-metre-high totem masks are placed to protect the living from spirits; whereas the &quot;duk-duk&quot; and &quot;tubuan&quot; masks of New Guinea are used to enforce social codes by intimidation. They are conical masks, made from cane and leaves.

===North America===
North American indigenous cultures in the Arctic and para-Arctic regions have tended towards simple religious practice but a highly evolved and rich mythology, especially concerning hunting. In some areas, annual shamanic ceremonies involved masked dances and these strongly abstracted masks are arguably the most striking artifacts produced in this region. Inuit groups vary widely and share neither a common mythology nor language. Not surprisingly their mask traditions are also often different, although their masks are often made out of driftwood, animal skins, bones, and feathers. In some areas Inuit women use finger masks during storytelling and dancing.

Indigenous Pacific Northwest coastal cultural groups generally included highly skilled woodworkers. Their masks were often masterpieces of carving, sometimes with movable jaws, with the parts sometimes moved by pulling cords, or a mask within a mask to represent a magical transformation. The carving of masks was an important feature of woodcraft, along with many other features that often combined the utilitarian with the symbolic, such as shields, canoes, poles, and houses.

Woodland tribes, especially in the northeastern and around the Great Lakes, cross-fertilized culturally with one another. The Iroquois made spectacular wooden &#x27;false face&#x27; masks, used in healing ceremonies and carved from living trees. These masks appear in a great variety of shapes, depending on their precise function.

Pueblo craftsmen produced impressive work for masked religious ritual, especially the Hopi and Zuni. The &quot;kachinas&quot; (gods and spirits) frequently take the form of highly distinctive and elaborate masks that are used in ritual dances. These are usually made of leather with appendages of fur, feathers, or leaves. Some cover the face, some the whole head, and are often highly abstracted forms. Navajo masks appear to be inspired by the Pueblo prototypes.

In modern immigrant Euro-American culture, masking is a common feature of Mardi Gras traditions, most notably in New Orleans. Costumes and masks (originally inspired by masquerade balls) are frequently worn by &quot;krewe&quot;-members on Mardi Gras Day; local laws against using a mask to conceal one&#x27;s identity are suspended for the day.

===Latin America===
Distinctive styles of masks began to emerge in pre-Hispanic America about 1200 BC, although there is evidence of far older mask forms. In the Andes, masks were used to dress the faces of the dead. These were originally made of fabric, but later burial masks were sometimes made of beaten copper or gold, and occasionally of clay.

For the Aztecs, human skulls were prized as war trophies, and skull masks were not uncommon. Masks were also used as part of court entertainments, possibly combining political with religious significance.

In post-colonial Latin America, pre-Columbian traditions merged with Christian rituals, and syncretic masquerades and ceremonies, such as All Souls/Day of the Dead developed, despite efforts of the Church to stamp out the indigenous traditions. Masks remain an important feature of popular carnivals and religious dances, such as The Dance of the Moors and Christians. Mexico, in particular, retains a great deal of creativity in the production of masks, encouraged by collectors. Wrestling matches, where it is common for the participants to wear masks, are very popular, and many of the wrestlers can be considered folk heroes. For instance, the popular wrestler El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask.

===Asia===

====China====

In China, masks are thought to have originated in ancient religious ceremonies. Images of people wearing masks have been found in rock paintings along the Yangtze. Later mask forms brings together myths and symbols from shamanism and Buddhism.

&quot;Shigong&quot; dance masks were used in shamanic rituals to thank the gods, while &quot;nuo&quot; dance masks protected from bad spirits. Wedding masks were used to pray for good luck and a lasting marriage, and &quot;Swallowing Animal&quot; masks were associated with protecting the home and symbolised the &quot;swallowing&quot; of disaster. Opera masks were used in a basic &quot;common&quot; form of opera performed without a stage or backdrops. These led to colourful facial patterns that we see in today&#x27;s Peking opera.

====India/Sri Lanka/Indo-China====
Masked characters, usually divinities, are a central feature of Indian dramatic forms, many based on depicting the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. Countries that have had strong Indian cultural influences – Cambodia, Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and Lao – have developed the Indian forms, combined with local myths, and developed their own characteristic styles.

The masks are usually highly exaggerated and formalised, and share an aesthetic with the carved images of monstrous heads that dominate the facades of Hindu and Buddhist temples. These faces or &quot;Kirtimukhas&quot;, &#x27;Visages of Glory&#x27;, are intended to ward off evil and are associated with the animal world as well as the divine. During ceremonies, these visages are given active form in the great mask dramas of the South and South-eastern Asian region.

====Indonesia====

In Indonesia, the mask dance predates Hindu-Buddhist influences. It is believed that the use of masks is related to the cult of the ancestors, which considered dancers the interpreters of the gods. Native Indonesian tribes such as Dayak have masked Hudoq dance that represents nature spirits. In Java and Bali, masked dance is commonly called &quot;topeng&quot; and demonstrated Hindu influences as it often feature epics such as &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The native story of Panji also popular in topeng masked dance. Indonesian topeng dance styles are widely distributed, such as topeng Bali, Cirebon, Betawi, Malang, Yogyakarta, and Solo.

====Japan====
Japanese masks are part of a very old and highly sophisticated and stylized theatrical tradition. Although the roots are in prehistoric myths and cults, they have developed into refined art forms. The oldest masks are the &quot;gigaku&quot;. The form no longer exists, and was probably a type of dance presentation. The &quot;bugaku&quot; developed from this – a complex dance-drama that used masks with moveable jaws.

The &quot;nō&quot; or noh mask evolved from the gigaku and bugaku and are acted entirely by men. The masks are worn throughout very long performances and are consequently very light. The &quot;nō&quot; mask is the supreme achievement of Japanese mask-making. &quot;Nō&quot; masks represent gods, men, women, madmen and devils, and each category has many sub-divisions. &quot;Kyōgen&quot; are short farces with their own masks, and accompany the tragic nō plays. Kabuki is the theatre of modern Japan, rooted in the older forms, but in this form masks are replaced by painted faces.

====Korea====
Korean masks have a long tradition associated with shamanism and later in ritual dance. Korean masks were used in war, on both soldiers and their horses; ceremonially, for burial rites in jade and bronze and for shamanistic ceremonies to drive away evil spirits; to remember the faces of great historical figures in death masks; and in the arts, particularly in ritual dances, courtly, and theatrical plays. The present uses are as miniature masks for tourist souvenirs, or on mobile phones, where they hang as good-luck talismans.
===Middle East===

Theatre in the Middle East, as elsewhere, was initially of a ritual nature, dramatising human relationships with nature, the deities, and other human beings. It grew out of sacred rites of myths and legends performed by priests and lay actors at fixed times and often in fixed locations. Folk theatre – mime, mask, puppetry, farce, juggling – had a ritual context in that it was performed at religious or rites of passage such as days of naming, circumcisions, and marriages. Over time, some of these contextual ritual enactments became divorced from their religious meaning and they were performed throughout the year. Some 2500 years ago, kings and commoners alike were entertained by dance and mime accompanied by music where the dancers often wore masks, a vestige of an earlier era when such dances were enacted as religious rites. According to George Goyan, this practice evoked that of Roman funeral rites where masked actor-dancers represented the deceased with motions and gestures mimicking those of the deceased while singing the praise of their lives (see &quot; Masks in Performance&quot; above).

===Europe===

The oldest representations of masks in Europe are animal masks, such as the cave paintings of Lascaux in the Dordogne in southern France. Such masks survive in the alpine regions of Austria and Switzerland, and may be connected with hunting or shamanism. Masks are used throughout Europe in modern times, and are frequently integrated into regional folk celebrations and customs. Old masks are preserved and can be seen in museums and other collections, and much research has been undertaken into the historical origins of masks. Most probably represent nature spirits, and as a result many of the associated customs are seasonal. The original significance would have survived only until the introduction of Christianity, which incorporated many of the customs into its own traditions. In that process their meanings were changed also so, for example, old gods and goddesses originally associated with the celebrations were demonised and viewed as mere devils, or were subjugated to the Abrahamic God.

Many of the masks and characters used in European festivals belong to the contrasting categories of the &#x27;good&#x27;, or &#x27;idealised beauty&#x27;, set against the &#x27;ugly&#x27; or &#x27;beastly&#x27; and grotesque. This is particularly true of the Germanic and Central European festivals. Another common type is the Fool, sometimes considered to be the synthesis of the two contrasting types, Handsome and Ugly. Masks also tend to be associated with New Year and Carnival festivals.

The debate about the meaning of these and other mask forms continues in Europe, where monsters, bears, wild men, harlequins, hobby horses, and other fanciful characters appear in carnivals throughout the continent. It is generally accepted that the masks, noise, colour, and clamour are meant to drive away the forces of darkness and winter, and open the way for the spirits of light and the coming of spring. In Sardinia existed the tradition of &quot;Mamuthones e Issohadores&quot; of Mamoiada; &quot;Boes e Merdules&quot; of Ottana; &quot;Thurpos&quot; of Orotelli; &quot;S&#x27;Urtzu&quot;, &quot;Su &#x27;Omadore&quot; and &quot;Sos Mamutzones&quot; of Samugheo. The celebration of Giubiana in Canzo (Lombardy) preserves a tradition of masks of anguane, wild man, bear and its hunter, and Giubiana herself, among others.

Another tradition of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities. These grew out of the earlier revels and had become evident by the 15th century in places such as Rome and Venice, where they developed as entertainments to enliven towns and cities. Thus the Maundy Thursday carnival in St. Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy, also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of &#x27;commedia dell&#x27;arte&#x27;-inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole &#x27;season&#x27; from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he was ugly enough not to need a mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the 18th century heyday were revived. It appears other cities in central Europe were influenced by the Venetian model.

During the Reformation, many of these carnival customs began to die out in Protestant regions, although they seem to have survived in Catholic areas despite the opposition of the ecclesiastical authorities. So by the 19th century, the carnivals of the relatively wealthy bourgeois town communities, with elaborate masques and costumes, existed side by side with the ragged and essentially folkloric customs of the rural areas. Although these civic masquerades and their masks may have retained elements drawn from popular culture, the survival of carnival in the 19th century was often a consequence of a self-conscious &#x27;folklore&#x27; movement that accompanied the rise of nationalism in many European countries. Nowadays, during carnival in the Netherlands masks are often replaced with face paint for more comfort.

In the beginning of the new century, on 19 August 2004, the Bulgarian archaeologist Georgi Kitov discovered a 673 g gold mask in the burial mound &quot;Svetitsata&quot; near Shipka, Central Bulgaria. It is a very fine piece of workmanship made out of massive 23 karat gold. Unlike other masks discovered in the Balkans (of which three are in Republic of Macedonia and two in Greece), it is now kept in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia. It is considered to be the mask of a Thracian king, presumably Teres.

== Masks in theatre ==
Masks play a key part within world theatre traditions. They continue to be a vital force within contemporary theatre, and their usage takes a variety of forms and has often developed from, or continues to be part of old, highly sophisticated, stylized theatrical traditions.

In many cultural traditions, the masked performer is a central concept and is highly valued. In the western tradition, actors in Ancient Greek theatre wore masks, as they do in traditional Japanese Noh drama. In some Greek masks, the wide and open mouth of the mask contained a brass megaphone enabling the voice of the wearer to be projected into the large auditoria. In medieval Europe, masks were used in mystery and miracle plays to portray allegorical creatures, and the performer representing God frequently wore a gold or gilt mask. During the Renaissance, masques and ballet de cour developed – courtly masked entertainments that continued as part of ballet conventions until the late eighteenth century. The masked characters of the Commedia dell&#x27;arte included the ancestors of the modern clown. In contemporary western theatre, the mask is often used alongside puppetry to create a theatre that is essentially visual, rather than verbal, and many of its practitioners have been visual artists.

=== Contemporary theatre ===
Masks and puppets were often incorporated into the theatre work of European avant-garde artists from the turn of the nineteenth century. Alfred Jarry, Pablo Picasso, Oskar Schlemmer, other artists of the Bauhaus School, as well as surrealists and Dadaists, experimented with theatre forms and masks in their work.

In the 20th century, many theatre practitioners, such as Meyerhold, Edward Gordon Craig, Jacques Copeau, and others in their lineage, attempted to move away from Naturalism. They turned to sources such as Oriental Theatre (particularly Japanese Noh theatre) and commedia dell&#x27;arte, both of which forms feature masks prominently.

Edward Gordon Craig (1872–1966) in &quot;A Note on Masks&quot; (1910) proposed the virtues of using masks over the naturalism of the actor. Craig was highly influential, and his ideas were taken up by Brecht, Cocteau, Genet, Eugene O&#x27;Neill – and later by Arden, Grotowski, Brook, and others who &quot;attempted to restore a ritualistic if not actually religious significance to theatre&quot;.

Copeau, in his attempts to &quot;Naturalise&quot; actors, decided to use masks to liberate them from their &quot;excessive awkwardness&quot;. In turn, Copeau&#x27;s work with masks was taken on by his students including Etienne Decroux and later, via Jean Daste and Jacques Lecoq. Lecoq, having worked as movement director at Teatro Piccalo in Italy, was influenced by the Commedia tradition. Lecoq met Amleto Satori, a sculptor, and they collaborated on reviving the techniques of making traditional leather Commedia masks. Later, developing Copeau&#x27;s &quot;noble mask&quot;, Lecoq would ask Satori to make him &quot;masques neutre&quot; (the neutral mask). For Lecoq, masks became an important training tool, the neutral mask being designed to facilitate a state of openness in the student-performers, moving gradually on to character and expressive masks, and finally to &quot;the smallest mask in the world&quot; the clown&#x27;s red-nose. One highly important feature of Lecoq&#x27;s use of mask, wasn&#x27;t so much its visual impact on stage, but how it changed the performers movement on stage. It was a body-based approach to mask work, rather than a visually led one. Lecoq&#x27;s pedagogy has been hugely influential for theatre practitioners in Europe working with mask and has been exported widely across the world. This work with masks also relates to performing with portable structures and puppetry. Students of Lecoq have continued using masks in their work after leaving the school, such as in John Wright&#x27;s &quot;Trestle Theatre&quot;.

In America, mask-work was slower to arrive, but the Guerrilla Theatre movement, typified by groups such as the San Francisco Mime Troupe and Bread and Puppet Theatre took advantage of it. Influenced by modern dance, modern mime, Commedia dell&#x27;arte and Brecht such groups took to the streets to perform highly political theatre. Peter Schumann, the founder of Bread and Puppet theatre, made particular use of German Carnival masks. Bread and Puppet inspired other practitioners around the world, many of whom used masks in their work. In the US and Canada, these companies include In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theater of Minneapolis; Arm-of-the Sea Theatre from New York State; Snake Theater from California; and Shadowland Theatre of Toronto, Ontario. These companies, and others, have a strong social agenda, and combine masks, music and puppetry to create a visual theatrical form. Another route masks took into American Theatre was via dancer/choreographers such as Mary Wigman, who had been using masks in dance and had emigrated to America to flee the Nazi regime.

In Europe, Schumann&#x27;s influence combined with the early avant-garde artists to encourage groups such as Moving Picture Mime Show and Welfare State (both in the UK). These companies had a big influence on the next generation of groups working in visual theatre, including IOU and Horse and Bamboo Theatre, who create a theatre in which masks are used along with puppets, film and other visual forms, with an emphasis on the narrative structure.

== Functional masks ==

Masks are also familiar as pieces of kit associated with practical functions, usually protective, including in sports and during plagues:

=== Medical ===
Some masks are used for medical purposes:
* N95 respirator, used for the prevention of tuberculosis and other pathogens
** FFP2, European equivalent
* Oxygen mask, a piece of medical equipment that assists breathing.
* Anesthetic mask.
* Burn mask, a piece of medical equipment that protects the burn tissue from contact with other surfaces, and minimises the risk of infection.
* Surgical mask, a tool for respiratory source control.
* Face shield, to protect a medical professional from bodily fluids.
* Pocket mask or &quot;CPR mask&quot;, used to safely deliver rescue breaths during a cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest.
* Cloth face mask, an alternative to respirators and surgical masks during shortages.

=== Protective ===

Protective masks are pieces of kit or equipment worn on the head and face to afford protection to the wearer, and today usually have these functions:
* Providing a supply of air or filtering the outside air (respirators and dust masks).
* Protecting the face against flying objects or dangerous environments, while allowing vision.

In Roman gladiatorial tournaments masks were sometimes used. From archaeological evidence it is clear that these were not only protective but also helped make the wearer appear more intimidating. In medieval Europe and in Japan soldiers and samurai wore similarly ferocious-looking protective armour, extending to face-masks.

In the 16th century, the Visard was worn by women to protect from sunburn. Today this function is attributed to thin balaclavas.

In sport the protective mask will often have a secondary function to make the wearer appear more impressive as a competitor.

Before strong transparent materials such as polycarbonate were invented, visors to protect the face had to be opaque with small eyeslits, and were a sort of mask, as often in mediaeval suits of armour, and (for example) Old Norse &quot;grímr&quot; meant &quot;mask or visor&quot;.

=== Disguise ===
Masks are sometimes used to avoid recognition. As a disguise the mask acts as a form of protection for the wearer who wishes to assume a role or task without being identified by others.
* Robbers and other criminal perpetrators may wear masks as a means in concealing their faces and thus identities from their victims and from law enforcement.
* Occasionally a witness for the prosecution appears in court in a mask to avoid being recognized by associates of the accused.
* Participants in a black bloc at protests usually wear masks, often bandannas, to avoid recognition, and to try to protect against any riot control agents used.
* In fiction, superheroes and supervillains often wear masks or for protection and to brand themselves.
Masks are also used to prevent recognition while showing membership of a group:
* Masks are use by penitents in ceremonies to disguise their identity in order to make the act of penitence more selfless. The Semana Santa parades throughout Spain and in Hispanic or Catholic countries throughout the world are examples of this, with their cone-shaped masks known as capirote.
* Masks are used by vigilante groups.
* The cone-shaped mask in particular is identified with the Ku Klux Klan in a self-conscious effort to combine the hiding of personal identity with the promotion of a powerful and intimidating image.
* Members of the group Anonymous frequently wear masks (usually Guy Fawkes masks, best known from &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;) when they attend protests.
While the niqāb usually shows membership of some Islamic community, its purpose is not to hinder recognition, although it falls under some anti-mask laws such as the French ban on face covering.

=== Occupational ===

* Beaked masks containing herbs in the beak were worn in early modern Europe by plague doctors to try to ward off the Black Death.
* Filter mask, a piece of safety equipment.
* Full-face diving mask as part of self-contained breathing apparatus for divers and others; some let the wearer talk to others through a built-in communication device
* Respirator (gas or particulate mask), a mask worn on the face to protect the body from airborne pollutants and toxic materials, and fine particulate matter or infectious particles.
* Oxygen mask worn by high-altitude pilots, or used in medicine to deliver oxygen, anesthetic, or other gases to patients
* Welding mask to protect the welder&#x27;s face and eyes from the brightness and sparks created during welding

=== Sports ===

* American football helmet face mask
* Balaclava, also known as a &quot;ski mask&quot;, to protect the face against cold air.
* Baseball catcher&#x27;s mask.
* Diving mask, an item of diving equipment that allows scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater.
* Fencing mask.
* Goaltender mask, a mask worn by an ice or field hockey goaltender to protect the head and face from injury.
* Hurling helmets were made mandatory in 2010, and have a wire mask on the front to protect the player&#x27;s face.
* Kendo, a mask called &quot;Men&quot; is used in this Japanese sword-fighting martial art.
* Paintball mask.
* Visor (ice hockey).

An interesting example of a sports mask that confounds the protective function is the wrestling mask, a mask most widely used in the Mexican/Latin lucha libre style of wrestling. In modern lucha libre, masks are colourfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes, and other archetypes. The mask is considered &quot;sacred&quot; to some degree, placing its role closer to the ritual and performance function.

==Punitive==
Masks are sometimes used to punish the wearer either by signalling their humiliation or causing direct suffering:
* Particularly uncomfortable types, such as an iron mask, for example the Scold&#x27;s bridle, are fit as devices for humiliation, corporal punishment or torture.
* Masks were used to alienate and &quot;silence&quot; prisoners in Australian jails in the late 19th century. They were made of white cloth and covered the face, leaving only the eyes visible.
* Use of masks is also common in BDSM practices.

==Fashion==
Decorative masks may be worn as part of a costume outside of ritual or ceremonial functions. This is often described as a masque, and relates closely to carnival styles. For example, attendants of a costume party will sometimes wear masks as part of their costumes.

Several artists in the 20th and 21st century, such as Isamaya Ffrench and Damselfrau, create masks as wearable art.
* Wrestling masks are used most widely in Mexican and Japanese wrestling. A wrestler&#x27;s mask is usually related to a wrestler&#x27;s persona (for example, a wrestler known as &#x27;The Panda&#x27; might wear a mask with a panda&#x27;s facial markings). Often, wrestlers will put their masks on the line against other wrestlers&#x27; masks, titles or an opponent&#x27;s hair. While in Mexico and Japan, masks are a sign of tradition, they are looked down upon in the United States and Canada.
* Several bands and performers, notably members of the groups Slipknot, Mental Creepers and Gwar, and the guitarist Buckethead, wear masks when they perform on stage. Several other groups, including Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Dimmu Borgir simulate the effect with facepaint. Hollywood Undead also wears masks but often remove them mid-performance.
* Leather-working, steampunk, and other methods and themes are occasionally used to create artisanal gas masks.

One user of masks in fashion is musician and fashion designer Kanye West. West has donned masks from Balenciaga and Maison Margiela, most notably on his Yeezus Tour.

==In works of fiction==

Masks have been used in many horror films to conceal the identities of the killer. Notable examples include Jason Voorhees of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series, Jigsaw Killer from Saw, Ghostface of the &quot;Scream&quot; series, and Michael Myers of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series.

=== Drama ===

* Bridal Mask - 2012 South Korean television series

==Other types==
* A &quot;buccal mask&quot; is a mask that covers only the cheeks (hence the adjective &quot;buccal&quot;) and mouth.
* A death mask is a mask either cast from or applied to the face of a recently deceased person.
* A &quot;facial&quot; (short for facial mask) is a temporary mask, not solid, used in cosmetics or as therapy for skin treatment.
* A &quot;life mask&quot; is a plaster cast of a face, used as a model for making a painting or sculpture.
* An animal roleplay mask is used for people to create a more animal-like image in fetish role play.
* A variety of technologies attempt to fool facial recognition software by the use of anti-facial recognition masks.

<doc id="247087" wikidata="Q377185" url="?curid=247087" title="Music of the Netherlands">
<text>The Netherlands has multiple musical traditions. Contemporary Dutch popular music is heavily influenced by music styles that emerged in the 1950s, in the United Kingdom and United States. The style is sung in both Dutch and English. Some of the latter exponents, such as Golden Earring and Shocking Blue, have attained worldwide fame.

Sometimes partly based and raised upon the tradition of &quot;Indorock&quot;, new acts with a mixture of Mainstream pop music, Dance, Jazz, Funk and Soul emerged in the mid-1980s. Many of them were and still are performing in and/or outside The Netherlands, and some of them gained (international) recognition, which would sometimes also result in a collaboration with major players from the United States or United Kingdom. An early example of these is Masada, a band with strong Moluccan roots, in the tradition of Santana. Some of the most successful artists among them were Mai Tai, Lois Lane, working with Prince, Julya Lo&#x27;ko, and saxophone player Candy Dulfer, also working with Prince, Dave Stewart and Pink Floyd. The mid-1990s saw the rise of Total Touch, with singer Trijntje Oosterhuis.

Another popular genre of Dutch music is known as &quot;Levenslied&quot;, meaning &quot;Song of/about life&quot;. These songs have catchy, simple rhythms and melodies, and are always built up on choruses and verses. Themes are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional Dutch musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are essential to levenslied, though in recent years many levenslied artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Koos Alberts and the late André Hazes and Willy Alberti.

Dutch techno, hardstyle, gabber, trance and other styles in electronic dance music conquered the world. Most of the best-known DJs in the EDM scene (and the world) hail from the Netherlands, including Tiësto, Don Diablo, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Sander van Doorn, Fedde le Grand, Hardwell, Showtek, Afrojack, Oliver Heldens, Ran-D, and Martin Garrix, all of whom consistently rank high in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs and other rankings. The Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) is the world&#x27;s leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet. These artists also contribute significantly to the mainstream pop music played over the airwaves all around the world, as they frequently collaborate and produce for many notable artists.

Hip-hop in the Dutch language (&quot;nederhop&quot;) has exploded since 2000 in the Netherlands and is also popular in Belgium. Songs like Traag, Europapa, Coño and Cartier even managed to reach a large international audience, and are to date, the most streamed Dutch language songs on Spotify in history, with each around 125 to 150 million total streams.

==Classical and contemporary classical music==
Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (May 1562 – October 16, 1621) was a Dutch composer, organist, and pedagogue whose work straddled the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the Baroque eras. Sweelinck was a master improviser, and acquired the informal title of the &quot;Orpheus of Amsterdam&quot;. Over 70 keyboard works of his have survived, and many of them may be similar to the improvisations that residents of Amsterdam around 1600 were likely to have heard. Even his vocal music, which is more conservative than his keyboard writing, shows a striking rhythmic complexity and an unusual richness of contrapuntal devices.

His influence was international. Some of his music appears in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which otherwise mainly contains the work of English composers. Sweelinck wrote variations on John Dowland&#x27;s internationally famous Lachrimae Pavane, and John Bull, the English keyboard composer, wrote a set of variations on a theme of Sweelinck, indicating the close connection between the different schools of composition across the North Sea.

Jacob van Eyck (ca. 1590–1657) was a blind recorder and organ virtuoso, who composed a unique collection of flute music.

Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer (1692–1766) was an accomplished baroque composer, whose work Concerti Armonici erroneously was attributed to Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. Igor Stravinsky used Unico&#x27;s music for Pulcinella.

Alphons Diepenbrock (September 2, 1862 – April 5, 1921) created a musical idiom which, in a highly personal manner, combined 16th-century polyphony with Wagnerian chromaticism, to which in later years was added the impressionistic refinement that he encountered in Debussy&#x27;s music.

Willem Pijper (1894–1947) is generally considered one of the most important figures in modern Dutch music. Between 1918 and 1922 he grew into one of the more advanced composers in Europe. In each successive work he went a step further and, from 1919, Pijper&#x27;s music can be described as atonal. However, Pijper remained a composer of strong emotional character, to which his Third Symphony (1926) bears witness. In Pijper&#x27;s later works the harmonic expression seems at times to approach monotonality. As a teacher Pijper had a great influence on modern Dutch music, teaching many prominent Dutch composers of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. He was senior master of instrumentation in the Amsterdam Conservatoire, and from 1930 until his death in 1947 he was Head of the Rotterdam Conservatoire.

Ton de Leeuw (born Rotterdam, 16 November 1926 - died Paris, 31 May 1996) is known for his experiments with microtonality. He wrote one opera, &quot;Antigone&quot; (1990–1991).

Lex van Delden (1919–1988) and Simeon ten Holt (1923–2012) were important composers.

Louis Andriessen (June 6, 1939 – July 1, 2021) was a composer whose early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends: postwar serialism (&quot;Series&quot;, 1958), pastiche (&quot;Anachronie I&quot;, 1966–67), and tape (&quot;Il Duce&quot;, 1973). Andriessen&#x27;s mature music combines the influences of Stravinsky and American minimalism. His harmonic writing eschews the consonant modality of much minimalism, preferring postwar European dissonance, often crystallised into large blocks of sound. Large-scale pieces such as &quot;De Staat&quot; [&#x27;Republic&#x27;] (1972–76), for example, were influenced by the energy of the big band music of Count Basie and Stan Kenton and the repetitive procedures of Steve Reich, both combined with bright, clashing dissonances. Andriessen&#x27;s music is thus anti-Germanic and anti-Romantic, and marks a departure from postwar European serialism and its offshoots. He also played a role in providing alternatives to traditional performance practice techniques, often specifying forceful, rhythmic articulations, and amplified, non-vibrato, singing. Other notable works include &quot;Workers Union&quot; (1975), a melodically indeterminate piece &quot;for any loud sounding group of instruments&quot;; &quot;Mausoleum&quot; (1979) for two baritones and large ensemble; &quot;De Tijd&quot; [&#x27;Time&#x27;] (1979–81) for female singers and ensemble; &quot;De Snelheid&quot; [&#x27;Velocity&#x27;] (1982–83), for three amplified ensembles; &quot;De Materie&quot; [&#x27;Matter&#x27;] (1984–88) a large four part work for voices and ensemble; collaborations with filmmaker and librettist Peter Greenaway on the film &quot;M is for Man, Music, Mozart&quot; and the operas &quot;Rosa: A Horse Drama&quot; (1994) and &quot;Writing to Vermeer&quot; (1998); and the recent &quot;La Passione&quot; (2000–02) for female voice and ensemble.

Significant composers after Andriessen include Klaas de Vries (born 1944), Jacob Ter Veldhuis, a.k.a. JacobTV (b. 1951), Guus Janssen (b. 1951) and Cornelis de Bondt (b. 1953).

==Folk==

Dutch folk music, is characterized by simple straightforward bass motives heavily supplemented with fast, often happy, melody. (Click here for an example.) Uncommon among other European folk, in Dutch music the bass line, not the melody, is the musical line that is danced to. This means that though the music itself may sound fast, the dances are usually quite moderate to slow in tempo. The dances themselves are mainly group dances rather than individual or dual dances. Clogs are often worn during dances; however, Dutch clog dancing is very different from its more modern counterpart. It is virtually impossible to perform highly active dances with Dutch clogs (which are entirely made from wood, not just the sole) and hence the clogs function as additional percussion, by stamping rhythmically.

In the early 19th century, rural Dutch folk began moving to cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam, bringing with them folk traditions. Many of their songs and dances, however, began to dwindle in popularity. In the early part of the 20th century, however, a number of urban intellectuals travelled to the countrysides to record with local musicians, a process paralleled in other European countries, such as Spain.

In the 1970s, the Netherlands underwent a roots revival, led by artists like Gerard van Maasakkers, Jos Koning, Dommelvolk and RK Veulpoepers BV, Fungus and Wolverlei. Many of the folk songs performed by these musicians was collected by Cobi Schreijer and Ate Doornbosch, the latter of whom broadcast them on his radio program &quot;Onder de groene linde&quot; (Under the green lime).

It was in about 1974 that the Dutch folk revival peaked, a year marked by the first recording of Fungus and the birth of Wargaren from the band Pitchwheel.

The mainstream popularity of the Dutch roots revival was short-lived, but it continued in Friesland, where a handful of groups, starting with Irolt in the mid-1970s, sang in the West Frisian language. Frisian folk music has survived thus, aided in part by the Aaipop Festival in Nylân and annual festival in Joure. At Joure&#x27;s festival, established in 1955, participants dress in 19th century-style clothes and perform traditional music and dance like the skotsploech ensembles.

Modern revivalists include the Groningen band Törf, Folkcorn, Pekel and Twee Violen en een Bas, Lirio, Dubius, Mus, Matzko, Wè-nun Henk.

Moluccan-Dutch musicians like Tala Mena Siwa and the Moluccan Moods Orchestra have had some success with pop-based Moluccan music, while kaseko, a style from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, has also seen mainstream popularity, primarily due to musicians like William Souvenir and Carlo Jones.

==Jazz==

The North Sea Jazz Festival attracts artists from international acclaim.

Misha Mengelberg (June 5, 1935 - March 3, 2017) was a jazz pianist and composer. He was the pianist on Eric Dolphy&#x27;s last album, &quot;Last Date&quot; (1964). Also featuring on that record was the drummer Han Bennink, and together with Piet Noordijk they formed a quartet which had a number of different bassists. They played at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1966. In 1967 he co-founded the Instant Composers Pool, an organisation which promoted avant garde Dutch jazz performances and recordings, with Han Bennink and Willem Breuker.

Mengelberg played with a large variety of musicians. He often performed in a duo with compatriot Bennink, and with other musicians including Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann, Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton.

Han Bennink (born April 17, 1942) is a jazz drummer, percussionist and multi-instrumentalist. Through the 1960s he drummed with a number of American musicians visiting the Netherlands, including Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins and Eric Dolphy. He subsequently became a central figure in the emerging European free improvisation (or free jazz) scene. From the late 1960s he played in a trio with saxophonist Peter Brötzmann and Belgian pianist Fred Van Hove, which became a duo after Van Hove&#x27;s departure in 1976. Through much of the 1990s he played in Clusone 3 (also known as the Clusone Trio), a trio with saxophonist and clarinetist Michael Moore and cellist Ernst Reijseger. He has often played duos with Mengelberg and collaborated with him alongside other musicians.

As well as playing with these long-standing groups, Bennink has performed and recorded solo (such as &quot;Tempo Comodo&quot; (1982)) and played with many free improvisation and free jazz musicians including Derek Bailey, Conny Bauer, Don Cherry and Alexander von Schlippenbach, as well as more conventional jazz musicians.

Willem Breuker (November 4, 1944 – July 23, 2010) was a jazz bandleader, composer, arranger, saxophonist, and bass clarinetist. Since 1974 he led the 10-piece Willem Breuker Kollektief, which performed jazz in a theatrical and often unconventional manner, drawing elements from theater and vaudeville.

==Pop music in the Dutch language==

Many Dutch artists have become popular by singing songs in their own language. It started with Peter Koelewijn in the late 1950s, the first to sing Rock and Roll in Dutch. In the 1960s it was mainly Boudewijn de Groot - to this day extremely popular. In the 1970s there were many performers, of which Rob de Nijs stood out. The 1980s were for André Hazes and less Koos Alberts. The 1990s were dominated by Marco Borsato. Other well-known names throughout the years were Jan Smit, Frans Bauer, Gerard Joling, Gordon, Guus Meeuwis and René Froger. Another notable Dutch band is Tambourine.

In addition, there is a great number of bands that compose and perform pop and rock songs in the Dutch language. That started in the 1970s with Polle Eduard, Bots and Normaal - which sang in dialect. Late 70s and early 80s there was a big boom of bands that used the Dutch-speaking songs. Well known representatives from that period: Doe Maar, Het Goede Doel, Frank Boeijen Groep and Toontje Lager, and during the late 80s De Dijk, The Scene and Tröckener Kecks. In the 1990s, there was a second boom of the genre in Acda en de Munnik, Bløf, Van Dik Hout and IOS.

==Rock and pop music==

Pioneers of Dutch rock were the so-called &quot;Indorock&quot; bands from the late 1950s, like The Tielman Brothers and the Blue Diamonds. They played rock guitar instrumentals at a time when white Dutch musicians did not perform rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. They stemmed from the Indo community in The Hague, which was also the center of the succeeding genre Nederbeat when Dutch musicians formed bands influenced by British beat groups and rock music. It earned that city the title of &quot;Beatstad&quot; (&#x27;Beat city&#x27;) in later years. With 60s bands like Golden Earring and Shocking Blue, and Kane and Anouk in the 1990s, The Hague became synonymous for mainstream rock.

More progressive music emerged in the 1960s in Amsterdam. In 1964 (see 1964 in music), The Outsiders were the first Dutch psychedelic rock band to become successful. Well known was the &#x27;Haagse Scene&#x27; - many of the popular bands of the 60s came from The Hague, such as Shocking Blue, which topped the US charts in 1970 with &quot;Venus&quot;, Golden Earring, Q65, The Motions, Earth &amp; Fire. Other representatives from this period: the Cats, Tee-Set, Bintangs, Sandy Coast, Cuby &amp; the Blizzards and Brainbox.
George Baker acquired international fame with the songs Little Green Bag (1969), and &quot;Una Paloma Blanca&quot; (1975).

From the late 1960s the post-war generation gained political influence. Many state subsidized rock venues opened all over the country. These clubs, like Amsterdam&#x27;s Paradiso and Melkweg, were stepping stones for many alternative rock bands on their first European tour and the Dutch crowd stayed well informed about new British and American acts.

In the 1970s some artists stood out. Herman Brood became the country&#x27;s ultimate rock &#x27;n roll icon. He even scored a hit in the US with &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, and subsequently became the epitome of the &quot;rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll junkie&quot; he often sang about. He had been in the media spotlight until his suicide in 2001. Other bands from the 70s include Pussycat (lead singer Toni Willé), whose song Mississippi hit the charts at number one in Netherlands in 1975 and many other countries including UK in 1976, Gruppo Sportivo, Massada, Vitesse, Solution, the Nits, Focus and still Golden Earring with their greatest hit ever: &quot;Radar Love&quot;, also Top 10 in the US.

The band Teach-In is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 with their song &quot;Ding-A-Dong&quot;. The band was founded in 1969 and parted in 1980. Throughout this time there were several changes in lineup.

The late 70s and early 80s gave rise to many one-hit wonders and some bands that lasted for longer. Girl groups Luv&#x27; and Dolly Dots but also disco bands Spargo and Time Bandits were among the most successful, alongside the Golden Earring, which scored some of their biggest hits with &quot;Radar Love&quot;, &quot;Twilight Zone&#x27; and &quot;When The Lady Smiles&quot;. The Nits developed a large audience outside the Netherlands, including Finland, Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium, Greece and Canada and in 1989 were the first Dutch band to play in the (then still) Soviet Union. Urban Dance Squad was a cross-over band, combining hip-hop with funk and rock. The band&#x27;s minor American success proved to be influential. Their music style (rapcore) influenced bands like Rage Against the Machine. Van Halen was created by Edward Van Halen who was of Dutch heritage.

The 1990s made international hits courtesy of 2 Unlimited, 2 Brothers On The 4th Floor, and Vengaboys. However, the 1990s was also the start of the DJ-era. Ferry Corsten, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, DJ Jean and Bart Claessen started their careers in the 1990s and became the stars of their era.

Dutch bands in the 2000s are Intwine, The Sheer, Naked Shepherd, Krezip, Di-rect and Johan.

Originally a semi-finalist in the fifth season of &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot;, singer-songwriter Duncan Laurence went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with his song &quot;Arcade&quot;, thereby granting the country its first Eurovision win since Teach-In in 1975. &quot;Arcade&quot; later became a sleeper hit by early 2021 and also entered the top 30 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, thus allowing Laurence to join the list of a few Dutch pop acts to score a hit in the US.

Current pop acts include Esmée Denters, Anouk, Sharon Doorson, Davina Michelle, Maan, Nielson, Eva Simons, Ilse DeLange, Toni Willé (Pussycat), Celine Cairo and Belgian-Dutch girl group K3.

===Hard rock===

Brothers and founding members of Van Halen, lead guitarist Edward van Halen and drummer Alex van Halen, are from the Netherlands - both born in Amsterdam in the mid-1950s and raised in Nijmegen - before moving to the United States in 1962.

===Punk rock===
Ivy Green was among the first punk bands, originating from Hazerswoude.

Tedje en de Flikkers, a group of homosexuals (&quot;flikkers&quot; is Dutch for &quot;faggots&quot;) from Nijmegen, was one of the most infamous punk formation of the Netherlands. They sprang from the left wing and gay movements that thrived in Nijmegen during the 1970s and 1980s. Their provocative performances (politically more than musically) often literally resulted in orgies of sex, drugs and noise. They existed only for three years (1977–1980).

The Ex is an Amsterdam group of musicians making something that could be called punk. De Heideroosjes is also a well-known Dutch punk rock group, singing in Dutch, English, German and Limburgish.

===Boerenrock===
Some bands create a kind of rock music sometimes called &quot;Boerenrock&quot; (&#x27;farmers rock&#x27;). These bands mix rock and pop music with regional influences, sometimes sung in one of the regional dialects, and lyrics influenced by life in rural areas. Examples include BZB (Band Zonder Banaan) and WC Experience from North Brabant, Normaal and Jovink en de Voederbietels from Gelderland who sing in Dutch Low Saxon, Rowwen Hèze and Neet Oét Lottum from Limburg who sing in Limburgish, Mooi Wark from Drenthe who also sing in Dutch Low Saxon and Jitiizer from Friesland who sing in West-Frisian.

Musically, the music played by such bands can be described as a rowdy, straightforward style of rock music, inspired by bands such as ZZ Top, Motörhead, AC/DC and Creedence Clearwater Revival. At other times, influences from pop music and folk music (for instance the case with Rowwen Hèze) can be heard.

Not rarely, these bands display a lot of humorous elements in their repertoire, lyrics and live performances. An example is the repertoire of the WC Experience, which contains cover songs from bands such as Queen, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Madness, only the lyrics are replaced by different, rather silly lyrics in their own dialect. Also, the name of &#x27;Band Zonder Banaan&#x27; means &quot;Band without a Banana&quot;, and is a humorous play on the name of a famous Dutch pop-band, BZN (Band Zonder Naam, or &#x27;Band Without a Name&#x27;). The name &quot;Jovink en de Voederbietels&quot; is a contraction of the names of the two founding band members (Hendrik Jan Lovink en Gijs Jolink), and &quot;voederbietel&quot; is a humorous contraction of the Dutch Low Saxon word for sugar beets (used as food for horses) and the name of the world-famous British popband The Beatles, of which they used a number of songs in which they replaced the lyrics for Achterhooks ones.

Boerenrock bands tend to perform at local festivities and concerts in big tents in rural areas, rather than in concert halls in bigger cities. An event where a lot of Boerenrock music can be heard, and a famous event amongst Boerenrock bands and fans, is the annual Zwarte Cross Festival (&#x27;Black Motocross&#x27;), which is organized by members of Jovink en de Voederbietels. The event is a mixture of several motocross related activities and a rock festival.

===Indie rock===

In the 1990s, indie rock band Bettie Serveert was formed and independent record label Excelsior Recordings released albums of Dutch indie rock bands like Caesar, Ghost Trucker, Alamo Race Track, Johan, Spinvis, Gem, Bauer, Daryll-Ann, zZz and many others. After 2000 Voicst was formed and became popular after a beer commercial hit single for Heineken. After leaving Zoppo and forming Avec-A musician Yuri Landman received international attention as an experimental luthier for famous experimental rock bands. Dutch noise rock acts are The Ex, Gone Bald, The Moi Non Plus, Adept, Bonne Aparte, Feverdream. Post-rock acts include We vs Death, Electropunk: Aux Raus. The indie music scene is mainly present in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, Groningen and Utrecht. A cross media platform called Subbacultcha! hosts nights in venues where many international touring avant garde rockbands like Health, Enon, Miracle Fortress, Mahjongg, These Are Powers, Pre perform as well as local indie and noise rock acts like The Moi Non Plus, Bonne Aparte, Adept, Hospital Bombers, Pfaff. Subbacultcha! also publishes a musical magazine with in depth interviews with the touring bands and arranges instant recording sessions in a studio in the Vondelpark with those bands. In the Hague, the State-X New Forms takes place annually in Paard van Troje.

==Heavy metal==
===Symphonic metal===

The Netherlands are also known for symphonic metal bands such as Within Temptation, The Gathering, Stream of Passion, After Forever, Delain and Epica. They became successful in the late 1990s and in the beginning of the new millennium. However, bands like Supersister and Kayak (who had a hit with Ruthless Queen) were already internationally successful in the 1970s. In the 1980s Vandenberg was internationally successful.

====Progressive metal====
Unique progressive metal music is composed by Arjen Anthony Lucassen. From the long list of his projects, Ayreon is the most famous. Arjen&#x27;s music is characterised by distinct vocals, storyline concepts and the wide spectrum of musical instruments used.

===Extreme metal===

====Death metal====
Similarly, in the last decade of the previous century a more extreme variety of metal, death metal, has had some success. Starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like Pestilence, Sinister, Asphyx, Altar, Gorefest, and God Dethroned gained popularity both inside and outside of Europe. At the present, bands like Pyaemia, Disavowed, Prostitute Disfigurement, Hail of Bullets, The Monolith Deathcult, Inhume, Callenish Circle, Rompeprop, Legion of the Damned, MaYaN and Severe Torture enjoy a similar status.

====Black metal====
Several black metal bands have risen to prominence from the Netherlands recently. Carach Angren, Cirith Gorgor, Israthoum, Dodecahedron, Ordo Draconis, Funeral Winds, Lugubre, Slechtvalk and Urfaust are some of the best-known. Israeli group Melechesh have also made the Netherlands their permanent base of operations. Viking/folk metal band Heidevolk are also gaining popularity.

====Doom metal====
Dutch doom metal bands include Officium Triste, Deinonychus, The Gathering and to a certain extent Asphyx.

==Experimental==
The Dutch musical culture has a small experimental music scene with a few artists that tour international such as Machinefabriek, solo projects of members of The Ex, Toktek, Gijs Gieskes, Knalpot, Yuri Landman, Jaap Blonk, Wessel Westerveld, Wouter van Veldhoven, Michiel van de Weerthof, Bram Stadhouders, his brother Jasper Stadhouders, Lukas Simonis and Michel Banabila . Also Pierre Bastien lives and works in The Netherlands, although not strongly connected to the Dutch scene. Venues like WORM in Rotterdam, Extrapool in Nijmegen and STEIM, OT301 and Mediamatic in Amsterdam are the main venues for this musical niche.

==Electronic music==

In the early 1990s, Dutch DJs developed a style of electronic dance music called gabber. The style was developed in reaction to the commercialization of house music and was heavily influenced by early hardcore from Frankfurt and New York City. The DJs stripped the music of what they perceived as excess sounds, songs were reduced to a high-speed monotonous beat, of sometimes over 260 beats per minute. The first ever record to be labeled gabber was &quot;Amsterdam waar lech dat dan?&quot; by Rotterdam-based &#x27;The Euromasters&#x27; as a reaction to the media always focusing on Amsterdam. It has to be said that Amsterdam-based D-Shake was probably to be the first to use the term gabber in a 1990 Dutch TV program. Important gabber groups and DJs are the Rotterdam Terror Corps, The Dark Raver and Neophyte. Gabbers distinguish themselves through hair (bald heads) and clothes (Australian and Cavello). Now, gabber is usually called early hardcore. Gabber also spawned happy hardcore, an offshoot of gabber and Breakbeat Hardcore, a genre of dance music that originated in the UK. Important groups and DJs in happy hardcore include Charly Lownoise and Mental Theo, Party Animals and Flamman &amp; Abraxas.

The Netherlands has also spawned many Eurodance acts, such as 2 Unlimited, Alice Deejay, the Venga Boys, the Two Brothers on the 4th Floor and Twenty Four Seven. Many of the world&#x27;s top trance DJs are Dutch, such as Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten and Tiësto. The DJ Mag Top 10 has been dominated by the Dutch for many years. In 2012, five of the 10 DJs were Dutch. Tiësto has been awarded best DJ three times in a row by DJ Mag and is still present in the top 10. Armin van Buuren then took over first place, subsequently doing this for four years in a row.
Many foreign DJs also live in and operate from the Netherlands. Drum and bass is also popular in the Netherlands, with notable artists including Noisia and Black Sun Empire. The Netherlands is also home to many of the largest trance events on earth, including Sensation and Trance Energy.

Other popular DJs from the Netherlands include Afrojack, Hardwell, Laidback Luke, Fedde le Grand, Nicky Romero, Dash Berlin, D-Block &amp; S-te-Fan, DJ Isaac, Wildstylez, Headhunterz, Brennan Heart, Sander van Doorn, W&amp;W, Ummet Ozcan, R3HAB, Yellow Claw, Ran-D and Martin Garrix.

The Dutch have through the years also made a reputation for themselves with their underground scene. A multitude of small independent record labels, event organizations and artists have cropped up through the years. Artists such as Speedy J, the Acid Junkies, Orlando Voorn, Miss Djax, Unit Moebius, and I-F have all gained international recognition, paving the way for several new electronic artists from the Lowlands.

==Hip hop==
Several Dutch groups have played an important role in the development of rap and hiphop in the Netherlands. The Urban Dance Squad, led by Rude Boy (who later also played with Junkie XL), produced an original mix of rock and rap, laying the foundation for the nu metal hype of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Def La Desh and the Fresh Witness, led by Wendy Wright, brought rap with vocals to the forefront, with groups like TLC following. The Osdorp Posse were the founders of Dutch language rap, or nederhop. Their frontman, Def P (Pascal Griffioen), switched from English to Dutch in 1988, which made him one of the first to rap in Dutch commercially. That year, Def P, IJsblok, King and Seda formed the Osdorp Posse. Over the years, they explored all sides of hiphop, from poetic hiphop to politically engaged hiphop. They introduced several Anglicisms in the Dutch language, such as &quot;moederneuker&quot; (&quot;motherfucker&quot;). But before Osdorp Posse, Rotterdam-based rapper Def Rhymz and other members of Bad Boys Posse already used the Dutch language for raps during underground concerts. Other important Dutch rappers are The Opposites, De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig, Pete Philly &amp; Perquisite, Extince, Kempi, Brainpower, Opgezwolle, Spookrijders, Snelle, Polderkartel, Typhoon, and Def Rhymz. Currently, Nicolay is one of the leading hip hop producers to come out of the region.

From 2000 onwards, Dutch hiphop has exploded and is dominating the charts. An overview of the most streamed Dutch-language songs on Spotify since October 11, 2024, shows that all but two listings are &quot;nederhop&quot; songs:

<text>A bullfighter (or matador) is a performer in the activity of bullfighting. &quot;Torero&quot; () or &quot;toureiro&quot; (), both from Latin &quot;taurarius&quot;, are the Spanish and Portuguese words for bullfighter, and describe all the performers in the activity of bullfighting as practised in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Peru, France, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and other countries influenced by Portuguese and Spanish culture. The main performer and leader of the entourage in a bullfight, and who finally kills the bull, is addressed as &quot;maestro&quot; (master), or with the formal title &quot;matador de toros&quot; (killer of bulls). The other bullfighters in the entourage are called &quot;subalternos&quot; and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador&#x27;s gold. They include the &quot;picadores&quot;, &quot;rejoneadores&quot;, and &quot;banderilleros&quot;.

Present since the sport&#x27;s earliest history, the number of women in bullfighting has steadily increased since the late-19 century, both on foot and on horseback. Usually, toreros start fighting younger bulls (&quot;novillos&quot; or, more informally in some Latin American countries, &quot;vaquillas&quot;), and are called &quot;novilleros&quot;. Fighting of mature bulls commences only after a special match, called &quot;the Alternative&quot;. At this same bullfight, the &quot;novillero&quot; (junior bullfighter) is presented to the crowd as a &quot;matador de toros&quot;.

== History ==
Bullfighting on foot became a means for poor, able-bodied men to escape poverty and achieve fame and fortune, similar to the role of boxing in other countries; this is reflected in the Spanish saying &quot;Más cornadas da el hambre.&quot; (&quot;Hunger gives more gorings.&quot;). Another frequent case for bullfighters is to be born in a family of bullfighters.

In English, a &quot;torero&quot; is sometimes referred to by the term &quot;toreador&quot;, which was popularized by Georges Bizet in his opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. In Spanish, the word designates bullfighters on horseback, but is little used today, having been almost entirely displaced by &quot;rejoneador&quot;. Bullfighting, historically, started more with nobles upon horseback, all lancing bulls with accompanying commoners on foot doing helper jobs. As time went by, the work of the commoners on foot gained in importance up to the point whereupon they became the main and only act. Bullfighting on horseback became a separate and distinct act called &quot;rejoneo&quot; which is still performed, although less often.

The established term, &quot;Maletilla&quot; or &quot;espontáneo&quot;, is attributed to those who illegally jump into the ring and attempt to bullfight for their sake and glory. While the practice itself is widely despised by many spectators and fans alike, it is often claimed that some bullfighters started their careers in this way, &quot;El Cordobés&quot; being one of them.

==Types==
===Matador de toros===


A &quot;matador de toros&quot; (lit. &quot;killer of bulls&quot;, from Latin &quot;mactator&quot;, killer, slayer, from &quot;mactare&quot;, to slay) is considered to be both an artist and an athlete, possessing agility and coordination. One of the earliest matadors was Juan Belmonte (1892–1962), whose technique in the ring fundamentally changed bullfighting and remains an established standard by which bullfighters are judged by &quot;aficionados&quot;. The style of the matador was regarded as being equally important, whether he kills the bull or not. The more successful &quot;matadores&quot; were treated like rock stars, with comparable financial incomes, cult followings and accompanied by tabloid stories about their romantic conquests with women.

The danger associated with bullfighting added to the matador&#x27;s performance; they are regularly injured by bulls and, concurrently, 533 professional bullfighters have been killed in the arena since 1700. Spanish bullfighter Manolete died from an injury in 1947. Matador Iván Fandiño died on 17 June 2017 at the &quot;Arènes Maurice-Lauche&quot; in Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour, France, from a similar bullfighting injury. This hazard is said to be central to the nature and appeal of bullfighting.

The American writer Ernest Hemingway was a bullfighting aficionado. In his 1926 fictional work, &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; the main storyline features a matador and scenes of bullfighting, as do his short stories &quot;The Capital of the World&quot; and &quot;The Undefeated&quot;. Outside of fiction, he also wrote at length on the subject in &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot; (1959).

In 1962, Hollywood producer David Wolper produced &quot;The Story of a Matador&quot;, documenting what it was like to be a matador. In this case, it was the Matador Jaime Bravo.

===Picador===


A picador is a bullfighter who uses a special lance called &quot;pica&quot; while on horseback to test the bull&#x27;s strength and to provide clues to the matador on which side the bull is favoring. They perform in the tercio de varas which is the first of the three stages in a Spanish bullfight. The shape of the lance or pica is regulated by Spanish law to prevent serious injury to the bull, which was viewed as unfair cheating in the past. The bull will charge the horses in the ring and, at the moments prior to contact, the picador lances the bull in a large muscle at the back of the neck; thus begins the work of lowering his head. The picador continues to stab at the bull&#x27;s neck, leading to the animal&#x27;s first major loss of blood. During this time, the bull&#x27;s injured nape will fatigue—however, as a result of the enraged bull charging, the picador&#x27;s horse will tussle with avoiding the bull throes at trying to lift the horse with its horns. The enduring loss of blood and exertion gradually weakens the bull further and makes it ready for the next stage.

In order to protect the horse from the bull&#x27;s horns, the horse is surrounded by a &#x27;peto&#x27; – a mattress-like protection. Prior to 1928, horses did not wear any protection and a bull would frequently disembowel the opposing horse during this vulnerable stage.

===Banderillero===

The &quot;banderillero&quot; is a torero who plants the &quot;banderillas&quot; (lit. little flags). These are colorful sticks, usually colored with the flag of the banderillero&#x27;s birthplace, with a barbed point which are increasingly placed in the top of the bull&#x27;s shoulder to weaken it. Banderilleros attempt to place the sticks while running as close to the bull as possible. They are judged by the crowd on their form and bravery. Sometimes a matador, who was a particularly skillful banderillero before becoming a matador, will place some banderillas himself. Skilled banderilleros can correct faults in the manner in which the bull charges by lancing the bull in such a way that the bull ceases hooking to one side, and thereby removing a potential source of danger to the matador by limiting the bull&#x27;s offensive movements.

==Costume==
Because of the decorations and elaborateness of the costume, the Spanish refer to the torero&#x27;s outfit as &quot;traje de luces&quot;, meaning the &quot;suit of lights&quot;. Matador costume structure provides great ease of movement.

<text>Einar Örn Benediktsson (born 29 October 1962), often billed as Einar Örn, is an Icelandic popular music singer and trumpet player. He was a member of the Sugarcubes. He served as a member of the Reykjavík City Council between 2010 and 2014.

==With Björk and the Sugarcubes==
Einar has been described as the first punk in Iceland . He claims he became interested in punk rock after reading about Johnny Rotten vomiting on an aeroplane and listening to John Peel on his mother&#x27;s car radio. Einar spent the summer of 1977 in London, where his father worked. Through this, he was able to make contacts enabling the Reykjavík arts festival to book The Clash in 1980.

In the early 1980s, Einar was the lead singer of the short-lived punk group Purrkur Pillnikk. Following Purrkur Pillnikk&#x27;s demise in 1983, Einar became a member of the anarcho-punk Kukl along with the already notable Icelandic singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir. During this period, whilst studying media at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) he got in touch with several punk groups such as Flux of Pink Indians and the anarchist band Crass. This eventually led to the release of Kukl&#x27;s two studio albums, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Eye&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Holidays in Europe&quot;, on Crass&#x27; in-house label Crass Records.

In June 1986, Smekkleysa SM or Bad Taste SM ltd was formed by a group of friends which included Einar, Björk, Sigtryggur, Einar Melax from Kukl, Bragi Ólafsson and Friðrik Erlingsson from Purrkur Pillnikk, Þór Eldon, Ólafur Engilberts and Sjón from the surrealist group Medúsa and lastly Ásmundur Jónsson from Gramm Records. Out of this group the Sugarcubes were formed, with Einar sharing vocal duties with Björk. While with the Sugarcubes, some critics scorned him for his bizarre spoken-word rants and discordant singing, which often overshadowed Björk&#x27;s more popular vocalizations. Others, however, defended his contributions as an essential component of the group&#x27;s free-spirited, chaotic ethos. Einar remained with the Sugarcubes until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1992.

In 2006, Einar reunited with the Sugarcubes for a one-off performance at the Laugardalshöll arena in Reykjavík.

==Post-Sugarcubes==
After the breakup of the Sugarcubes, Einar wrote a newspaper column &quot;Close Encounter&quot; (&quot;about daily life in Reykjavík&quot;), promoted records for the Sugarcubes&#x27; former Icelandic label, Bad Taste (&quot;Smekkleysa&quot;), which he had co-founded, and worked as a bartender. Music went on the backburner: &quot;I was discovering other things, like family life. I wanted to make music a hobby again.&quot;

He recorded with Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (HÖH) in 1992: &quot;We were great friends who decided to make music for the hell of it, and it turned into a record&quot; (&quot;Frostbite&quot;, on One Little Indian). He also worked in concert promotion (two Björk shows, The Prodigy, Fugees and Massive Attack) and co-founded Reykjavík&#x27;s first cybercafe The Siberia Cafe: &#x27;We were too early. Those who knew what it was all about preferred to do their Internet hacking at home.&quot;

Einar worked for the Reykjavík Arts Festival before moving back to London in late 1997 to set up OLI&#x27;s Web sites: &quot;I saw this gap, which I could fill. It&#x27;s always good to get a new perspective.&quot;

In 1998, Einar teamed up with Hilmar Örn and former Sugarcubes drummer Sigtryggur &quot;Siggi&quot; Baldursson as Grindverk. &quot;It&#x27;s dance music for people who cannot dance. It&#x27;ll probably be instrumental too. It&#x27;s not because people have criticised me, I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve written anything I want to sing.&quot; Grindverk released a single album, &quot;Gesundheit Von K&quot;, on the British-based Fat Cat Records.

In 2000, Einar collaborated with Blur lead singer Damon Albarn on the soundtrack for the acclaimed Icelandic film &quot;101 Reykjavík&quot;. The soundtrack was released by EMI the following year. Einar also worked with Albarn&#x27;s project Gorillaz on the song &quot;Stop The Dams.&quot; The track originally appeared as a 2006 B-side on the single &quot;Kids With Guns&quot; / &quot;El Mañana.&quot; It was re-released on the 2007 compilation album &quot;D-Sides&quot;.

Einar has not ruled out future musical projects stating, &quot;I&#x27;m waiting to see if the occasion arises. The Sugarcubes wasn&#x27;t scripted, remember. Of course, I&#x27;m older but I would treat the occasion with the same passion!&quot;

==Ghostigital==
In December 2003 Einar embarked on his first solo project. He debuted with an album called &quot;Ghostigital&quot;, recorded with the New York City-based Icelandic producer Curver. It was released by Honest Jon&#x27;s Records in December 2003. The name of this first album would later turn into the name of a band, comprising Einar and Curver and a host of collaborators. The music is described as &quot;electronic beat music&quot;, drawing in elements of dub, hip-hop, Rock and noise, combined with Einar&#x27;s idiosyncratic worldview.

In 2005 Ghostigital signed with the California-based label Ipecac Recordings co-founded by Faith No More singer Mike Patton. Their first Ipecac release, &quot;In Cod We Trust&quot;, was released in March 2006. On this record Einar&#x27;s son Kaktus (currently frontman of Fufanu) plays trumpet. It also features contributions from Mark E Smith, Sensational, Ásgerður Júníusdóttir and KatieJane Garside.

Ghostigital released their third studio album called &quot;Division of Culture &amp; Tourism&quot; on Smekkleysa SM/BadTaste Records on 12 November 2012. It features contributions from Damon Albarn, David Byrne, Nick Zinner, Dälek, and King Buzzo.

==Art practice==
In his art practice Einar Örn has utilized a wide range of media; sound art, performance, words, music and multimedia but is currently focusing on works on paper, large scale murals and textile prints. All connected through his playful way of telling stories that simultaneously amuse and baffle.
Einar Örn has exhibited internationally and in Iceland.

==Politics==
Although he had no prior political experience, Einar was elected to the Reykjavík City Council in May 2010 as a member of the satirical Best Party (&quot;Besti flokkurinn&quot;) along with Reykjavík Mayor Jón Gnarr and others. Einar was second on the party&#x27;s list behind Jón. Einar and other Best Party members were part of the governing coalition in Reykjavík along with the Social Democratic Alliance (&quot;Samfylkingin&quot;). He chaired the city&#x27;s committee for culture and tourism. The Best Party did not run for re-election in 2014, instead choosing to disband.

<text>A treasury is either 
*A government department related to finance and taxation, a finance ministry; in a business context, corporate treasury.
*A place or location where treasure, such as currency or precious items are kept. These can be state or royal property, church treasure or in private ownership.

The head of a treasury is typically known as a treasurer. This position may not necessarily have the final control over the actions of the treasury, particularly if they are not an elected representative.

The adjective for a treasury is normally treasurial. The adjective &quot;tresorial&quot; can also be used, but this normally means pertaining to a &quot;treasurer&quot;.

==History==
The earliest found artefacts made of silver and gold are from Lake Varna in Bulgaria dated 4250–4000 BC, the earliest of copper are dated 9000–7000 BC.

The Greek term &quot;thêsauros&quot; (treasury) was first used in Classical times to describe the votive buildings erected to house gifts to the gods, such as the Siphnian Treasury in Delphi or many similar buildings erected in Olympia, Greece by competing city-states to impress others during the ancient Olympic Games. In Ancient Greece treasuries were almost always physically incorporated within religious buildings such as temples, thus making state funds sacrosanct and adding moral constraints to the penal ones to those who would have access to these funds.

The sovereigns&#x27; treasury within the palace in ancient Jerusalem is considered to be similar in nature to the temple treasury. The temple treasury of the settlement had appointed officials and functioned akin to a bank.

In excavations of Persepolis, a text containing information pertaining to the activities of a temple treasury were discovered dated to the fifth century BC. The texts written in the Elamite language name the treasurer as &quot;&quot; 

The ancient Roman word &quot;aerarium&quot; signified the treasury of the Senate; &quot;fiscus&quot; indicated the imperial treasury used by the emperor.
==Treasuries as government departments==

===Treasury===
In the United Kingdom, His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury is overseen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The traditional honorary title of First Lord of the Treasury is held by the prime minister. His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs administers the taxation system.

In the United States, the Treasurer reports to an executive-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The IRS is the revenue agency of the US Department of the Treasury.

===Ministry of finance===
In many other countries, the treasury is called the &quot;ministry of finance&quot; and the head is known as the finance minister. Examples include the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belgium, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Ghana, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.

===Both===
In some other countries, a &quot;Treasury&quot; will exist alongside a separate &quot;Ministry of Finance&quot;, with divided functions.

The State Treasury () in Polish law represents the Polish state acting in the field of civil law relations in which it is treated as equal partner to private entities (as opposed to the sphere of public law relations in which the State represented by public authorities decides unilaterally on the legal situation of individuals). It can be represented by various officials or institutions depending on circumstances and has its own ministry, the Ministry of State Treasury. Historically, it was created in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1590, when the public treasury (or the Crown Treasury) was split from the Royal Treasury.

The government of Ukraine also includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of State Treasury. It was the same in Italy before the creation of the united Ministry of Economy.

In the Australian federal government a treasurer and a finance minister co-exist. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for drafting the government budget, economic policy (except monetary policy), some market regulation and revenue policy (which is administered by the Australian Taxation Office). The Finance Minister, who manages the Department of Finance, is responsible for budget management, government expenditure and market deregulation.

==Treasuries as locations==
A treasury is also a room or building in which precious or valuable objects are preserved, especially &quot;objets d’art&quot; in precious metals and jewels, of a ruler or other collector which are kept in a secure room and often found in the basement of a palace or castle.
===State treasuries===
In past times revenue collected by the monarch would be kept in a secure stronghold; the kings of England traditionally used the Tower of London, which also housed the Royal Mint. Latterly gold reserves are held in a country&#x27;s central bank; the gold reserves of the United Kingdom are housed in a vault at the Bank of England.

The country with the largest gold reserve is the United States; the US claims to have 8133.5 tons of gold, held at Fort Knox (58%), West Point (20%), the US Mint in Denver (16%) and the residue (approximately 5%) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The second largest reserve, that of Germany, is held at the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and the Bank of England in London.

The third, held by the IMF, is in a number of in designated deposits.

These treasuries are believed to satisfy a number of essential criteria, which include cost efficiency, security, and the ability to liquidate reserves at short notice.

===Church treasuries===

The Church has a variety of treasures that have spiritual or religious value rather than financial worth; these are housed in treasuries at most cathedrals. These take the form of relics, icons, manuscripts, votive offerings and liturgical garments. Of particular note are the St Chad Gospels at Lichfield Cathedral, and the Codex Eyckensis at St Catherine&#x27;s Church, Maaseik. The treasury at Aachen cathedral has a number of valuable artifacts, such as the Cross of Lothair and the Treasury Gospels.

===Private treasuries===
Collections of personal treasures, where the objects assembled are there because of the interest of the collector, rather than any intrinsic value, have been seen since the times of the Ancient Greeks, and more particularly, the Romans. For example, various Roman emperors devoted considerable effort to bring Egyptian obelisks from the Middle East to Rome, or had copies made in Rome itself. 
In medieval times a number of monarchs had menageries of exotic beasts; Henry III (r.1216-1292) owned three leopards, a polar bear and an African elephant, while emperor Frederick II (r.1220-1250) owned giraffes, cheetahs, lynxes, leopards, exotic birds and an elephant, and had a variety of rare falcons. The private collection of curiosities in England has been ascribed to 16th century polymath Francis Bacon, and in Europe to the emperor Rudolph II. In Russia this was pioneered by tsar Peter the Great.
Notable modern collections include the Waddesdon and the Wallace collections in Britain, and the Getty and Guggenheim collections in the US.

<text>A treasurer is a person responsible for the financial operations of a government, business, or other organization.

==Government==

The treasury of a country is the department responsible for the country&#x27;s economy, finance and revenue. The treasurer is generally the head of the treasury, although, in some countries (such as the United Kingdom or the United States) the treasury reports to a Secretary of the Treasury or Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In Australia, the Treasurer is a senior minister and usually the second or third most important member of the government after the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Each Australian state and self-governing territory also has its own treasurer.

From 1867 to 1993, Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Finance was called the Treasurer of Ontario.

Originally the word referred to the person in charge of the treasure of a noble; however, it has now moved into wider use. In England during the 17th century, a position of Lord High Treasurer was used on several occasions as the third great officer of the Crown. Now the title First Lord of the Treasury is the official title of the British Prime Minister.

==Corporate treasurers==

In corporations, the Treasurer is the head of the corporate treasury department. 
They are typically responsible for:
liquidity risk management; 
cash management; 
issuing debt, and capital structure more generally (including share issuance and repurchase);
managing intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies, interest rate risk hedging, and currency analytics;
securitizations;
oversight of pension investment management.
They also typically advise the corporation on matters relating to corporate finance. They could also have oversight of other areas, such as the purchase of insurance.

==In the Inns of Court==
In the Inns of Court, the professional associations for barristers in England and Wales, the &quot;bencher&quot; or &quot;master of the bench&quot; who heads the inn for that year holds the title &#x27;master treasurer&#x27;.

This title is similarly used by other legal associations sharing a British heritage, such as the Law Society of Upper Canada.

== Volunteer organizations ==
Many volunteer organizations, particularly not-for-profit organizations such as charities and theaters, appoint treasurers who are responsible for conservation of the treasury, whether this be through pricing of a product, organizing sponsorship, or arranging fundraising events.

The treasurer would also be part of the group which would oversee how the money is spent, either directly dictating expenditure or authorizing it as required. It is their responsibility to ensure that the organization has enough money to carry out their stated aims and objectives, and that they do not overspend, or under spend. They also report to the board meetings or the general membership the financial status of the organization to ensure checks and balances. Accurate records and supporting documentation must be kept to a reasonable level of detail that provides a clear audit trail for all transactions.

<doc id="247098" wikidata="Q500488" url="?curid=247098" title="Sabotage (1936 film)">
<text>Sabotage, released in the United States as The Woman Alone, is a 1936 British spy thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Sylvia Sidney, Oskar Homolka, and John Loder. It is loosely based on Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1907 novel &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist agent.

&quot;Sabotage&quot; should not be confused with Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, which was also released in 1936, but which instead is loosely based on two stories in the 1927 collection &quot;&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. It also should not be confused with Hitchcock&#x27;s unrelated 1942 American film &quot;Saboteur&quot;.

In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked the film 44th best British film ever. In 2021, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked the film at No. 3 on its list of &quot;The 100 best British films of all time&quot;.

it received some controversy back in 1936 including a death of a child which was shocking for its time.

==Plot==
In London, sand is put into the bearings of an electrical generator, causing a power blackout. At a cinema owned by Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka), people demand their money back. Verloc enters through a back entrance to the living quarters above. He washes sand from his hands, but when his wife (Sylvia Sidney) comes for him, he pretends to have been asleep. He instructs her to refund the money, saying he has &quot;some money coming in&quot; anyway. As the money is about to be disbursed to the customers downstairs, the lights go back on.

The next day, Verloc meets his contact. They are part of a gang of terrorists from an unnamed European country who are planning a series of attacks in London, though no exact motive is made clear. Verloc&#x27;s contact is disappointed that the newspapers mocked the short loss of electricity, and instructs Verloc to place a parcel of &quot;fireworks&quot; at the Piccadilly Circus tube station on Saturday, during the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show. Verloc is not comfortable with killing, but his contact says to get someone else to do it. Verloc is given the address of a bird shop, whose owner also makes bombs.

Scotland Yard suspects Verloc&#x27;s involvement in the plot and has placed Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer (John Loder) undercover as a greengrocer&#x27;s helper next to the cinema. He befriends Mrs. Verloc and her younger brother, Stevie (Desmond Tester), who lives with them, by treating them to a meal at Simpson&#x27;s. At this point, Spencer and Scotland Yard are unsure whether Mrs. Verloc is complicit in the terrorist plots or innocently unaware; but by the end of the meal, he is convinced she is innocent and is falling for her.

Verloc goes to the bird shop. The bomb-maker says he will prepare a time bomb and set it to explode at 1:45 p.m. on Saturday. Later that night, members of the terrorist group meet in Verloc&#x27;s living room above the cinema. Detective Spencer attempts to eavesdrop on the conversation, but is seen and recognized. The meeting ends abruptly and the members scatter, worried that they are all being followed. Verloc tells his wife the police are investigating him, but maintains his innocence.

The next day, Verloc receives a package containing two caged canaries – a present for Stevie – and the bomb. Spencer shows up with Stevie and tells Mrs. Verloc of Scotland Yard&#x27;s suspicions. Verloc sees them talking, and becomes nervous. Before he can be questioned, Verloc asks Stevie to deliver a film canister to another cinema, and since it is on his way, to deposit another package in the cloakroom at Piccadilly Circus station by 1:30 p.m. He says it contains projector parts to be repaired and the repairman will collect it there.

Unknowingly carrying the time bomb for Verloc, Stevie is delayed by several events, including the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show procession. Now late, Stevie manages to talk himself aboard a bus to Piccadilly Circus, even though flammable nitrate film is not allowed on public vehicles. The bomb explodes on the bus, killing Stevie and others.

Verloc confesses to his wife, but blames Scotland Yard and Spencer for Stevie&#x27;s death, since they were the ones who prevented Verloc from delivering the bomb himself. Soon afterwards, as they are preparing to eat dinner, she becomes angry and sullen. He walks toward her slowly as she holds a carving knife in front of her. He walks into the knife, stabbing himself and dies. When Spencer arrives to arrest Verloc he realises what has happened, but he insists that she should not admit stabbing her husband. Even if it was self-defence, she might not be believed in court. Spencer plans to abandon his career and leave the country with her.

The bomb-maker goes to Verloc&#x27;s flat to retrieve the birdcage in case it might incriminate him, but the police, who already suspect him, follow him. When they arrive, Mrs. Verloc tries to confess, but moments after she says her husband is dead, the bomb-maker sets off a bomb he was carrying, killing himself and destroying Verloc&#x27;s body.

Afterwards, the police superintendent is unsure whether she spoke before or after the explosion, as Ted and Mrs. Verloc flee the city.

==Cast==
==Production==
Hitchcock wanted to cast Robert Donat – with whom he had previously worked in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) – as Spencer, but was forced to cast another actor (John Loder) owing to Donat&#x27;s chronic asthma. According to Hitchcock, in his interviews with the French director François Truffaut, Alexander Korda, to whom Donat was under contract, refused to release him. Hitchcock, who was not happy with Loder&#x27;s casting, later commented, &quot;The actor we got wasn&#x27;t suitable, and I was forced to rewrite the dialogue during the shooting&quot;. Charles Bennett says Sylvia Sidney was upset when Loder was cast as she agreed to make the film to work with Donat.

Hitchcock also chose the young Bobby Rietti – later known as Robert Rietti – to play the part of Steve, but was not able to sign him for legal reasons.

==Reception==
Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;a masterly exercise in suspense.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Competent and experienced hand of the director is apparent throughout this production, which is a smart one and executed in a business-like manner from start to finish.&quot; However, the review noted that the motivation of the terrorists &quot;is not made clear. As a result, the audience watches the piece and its suspensive moments with interest, and when it is over, is still hazy as to the why and wherefore.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;A thrilling melodrama,&quot; adding that Hitchcock &quot;again shows his skill in building up a situation to a tense climax.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The individual genius of Hitchcock is very clearly shown in the distinctive and original direction,&quot; and called Oscar Homolka&#x27;s performance &quot;remarkable.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;rather exciting for the most part. It&#x27;s a lively, minor Alfred Hitchcock picture.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, pronouncing that &quot;in &quot;Sabotage&quot; for the first time [Hitchcock] has really &#x27;come off&#x27;&quot;. Greene identified the children&#x27;s matinée scene as an &quot;ingenious and pathetic twist stamped as Mr Hitchcock&#x27;s own&quot;, and he praised the melodrama present in the screenplay writing, the dialogue, and the acting cast generally. Greene&#x27;s only complaint was in relation to the acting of the &quot;unconvincing&quot; detective (Loder) and the &quot;invincibl[y] distaste[ful]&quot; prep school student (Tester).

&quot;Sabotage&quot; has a 92% &quot;fresh&quot; score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

==Adaptation==
Bennett liberally adapted Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel, transforming the highly political Tsarist-era agents provocateurs into foreign agents without any obvious political leanings. Verloc&#x27;s shop is transformed into a cinema, with the films being shown echoing the story, and the policeman investigating the case is an undercover officer posing as a greengrocer. Since the film was produced in the years immediately preceding World War II, the unnamed hostile power behind the bombings has been assumed by many viewers to be Nazi Germany. However, the film does not specify this, and indeed, Verloc&#x27;s first name has been changed, presumably because his name in the novel, Adolf, had too many connotations by the time the film was made.

Stevie, Mrs. Verloc&#x27;s brother, is portrayed as an ordinary schoolboy, with few of the visionary attributes of his literary counterpart. Stevie&#x27;s death is a climactic moment in the plot, providing insight into Hitchcock&#x27;s views about how the innocent suffer through random acts of violence. When a critic condemned Stevie&#x27;s death as brutal and unnecessary, Hitchcock said that he regretted including it in the film, not because of the brutality, however, but because it violated his method of suspense, whereby tension eventually had to be relieved. Yet, Hitchcock remained faithful to the novel in having the bomb go off, and it also allowed him to justify in the movie that the boy&#x27;s sister would eventually kill her husband, who was responsible for the boy&#x27;s death, and get away with it.

==Allusions==
The fact that many scenes of the film were set in a cinema allowed Hitchcock to include references to contemporary films and storylines. Perhaps the most famous of these is the final film sequence, an excerpt from one of Walt Disney&#x27;s Silly Symphonies, &quot;Who Killed Cock Robin?&quot; (1935).

==Legacy==
Quentin Tarantino used the scene where Stevie is initially not allowed onto the bus due to the nitrate film he is carrying, in his film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. This was used to explain the use of nitrate film for the character&#x27;s terrorist plot.

<doc id="247104" wikidata="Q7038565" url="?curid=247104" title="Ninety-nine (trick-taking card game)">
<text>Ninety-nine is a card game for 2, 3, or 4 players. It is a trick-taking game that can use ordinary French-suited cards. Ninety-nine was created in 1967 by David Parlett; his goal was to have a good 3-player trick-taking game with simple rules yet great room for strategy.

In ninety-nine, players bid for the number of tricks that they will take; players who gain exactly that number of tricks (no more or less) gain a significant bonus. One unusual feature of ninety-nine is that players bid by discarding three cards.

== Rules ==

=== Dealing ===

A round of ninety-nine begins with the deal of a shuffled deck.
The two- and three-player versions of the game use only the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
(ranked from lowest to highest) - note that 6 is the lowest rank, and that
the 2 through 5 are not included in the deck.
The four-player version of the game uses the entire 52-card deck (in which case the 2
is the lowest rank).
Players are dealt the entire deck, one card at a time, with all cards face down.
In the two-player version, the cards are dealt to the two players and also to a third
pseudo-player called the &quot;dummy&quot;.
As a result, in the two- and three-player versions players are initially dealt 12 cards,
while in the four-player version players are initially dealt 13 cards.
Players should sort their cards by suit, and by rank inside a suit.

Trump suit is then determined. In the very first round of a game, there are no trumps.
After that, the trump suit is determined by the number of players who won the last round:
Diamonds if 0, Spades if 1, Hearts if 2, and Clubs if 3.
In the four-player version, if all four players win a round, the next round is played
with no trumps.

=== Bidding ===

Each player then bids on the number of tricks they expect to take.
Players bid by discarding any three cards in their hand; each suit is worth a certain
number of tricks, and the total number bid by three cards determines the bid
using the following code:
Thus, if a player discards a club and two diamonds, they have bid 3+0+0=3 tricks.

Normally, these discarded &quot;bid&quot; cards are placed face-down on the table, so that the
other players will not know how many tricks that player is trying to take.
However, a player who is very confident with his hand can also make two kinds of premium bids,
which are made out loud to the other players:
a &quot;declaration&quot;, where the bid cards will be shown face-up, or a &quot;revelation&quot;, where
every one of the player&#x27;s cards will be placed face up.
Only one player can make a premium bid in a round; a revelation outbids a declaration,
otherwise the Dealer&#x27;s left has the highest priority. A declarer in position can reveal if a player behind them states intent to reveal.

In a 2-player game, both live players can declare, but neither player can reveal.
Also, in the 2-player game, three cards are arbitrarily chosen from the dummy&#x27;s hand and
set aside as the dummy&#x27;s bid (neither live player knows what the dummy has &quot;bid&quot;).

=== Trick-taking ===

After the bidding has been completed, trick-taking begins.
If playing the 2-player version, the &quot;dummy&#x27;s&quot; cards other than the 3 bidding cards
are first placed face-up and sorted by suit.

In 3- and 4-player versions, the player to the dealer&#x27;s left plays the first card,
and play continues clockwise. In the 2-player version, the non-dealer begins play.

Players must follow suit of the suit led if they can, else they can play any card;
they need not beat a card even if they can.
If a trump card is played, the highest-ranking trump card wins, else the highest-ranking
card of the suit led wins.
The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.

In the 2-player version, if a live player leads to a trick, then the other live player plays next,
and the leading player then can choose any (legal) card from the dummy&#x27;s hand.
If the dummy wins a trick, the live player who last led chooses the dummy&#x27;s card, the other
live player plays next, and the player who last led plays from his own hand.
Thus, the &quot;dummy&quot; is always first or last to play in the 2-player version.

=== Scoring a round ===

After all the cards have been played, the round is scored.
Players earn one point for every trick they won, regardless of any other bonuses
(or the lack of them).
A player who acquired exactly the number of tricks they bid gains a bonus depending on the
number of others who also made their bid.

If only one player succeeded, that player earns 30 points;
if two succeeded, each earns 20 points; if three succeeded, each earns 10 points;
and if all four succeeded in a 4-player game there is no bonus.
A declaration adds 30 points (to the declarer if successful, to the others if not);
a revelation is worth 60 points (to the declarer if successful, to the others if not).

Note that in the 3-player game, the maximum score in one round is ninety-nine (hence the name):
9 points for winning all nine tricks, 30 points for bidding 9 tricks and getting them
(while no one else got their bid), and 60 points for a revelation.

In the 2-player version, the dummy is considered to have succeeded if the dummy wins
fewer tricks than it bid, failed if it wins more tricks than it bid,
and declared if it met exactly the number of bid tricks.
If both live players declare and neither makes it, the dummy gets 60 points.

=== Games and matches ===

Ninety-nine can be played by simply playing until some player reaches a predetermined total
over many rounds (e.g., 200 or 500); the player with the largest score wins.
If playing as a 2-player game, the dummy&#x27;s score is not tracked.

Parlett&#x27;s recommending system for scoring games and matches is more intricate.
He recommends that a game end when a player has reaches 100 points or more;
any player who reaches or exceeds 100 points in that round also gains a 100-point game bonus,
but they only get the game bonus if they succeed in that round (otherwise, they do not get the
game bonus, though they get any other bonuses they are entitled to).
A new game then starts.
When one or more players wins 3 game bonuses,
the totals across all games are totalled, and the player with the highest score wins.

=== Variants ===
Parlett&#x27;s original rules, now referred to as the &quot;classic&quot; version, included a joker in the deal. This meant that (in the three-player game) there was one card remaining after the players were dealt their cards. This card was then turned over to indicate the trump suit for that deal (same suit as the turn-up). If the card turned over was the joker or a nine, then the hand was played as &quot;no trumps&quot;. A player receiving the joker in their hand, treated it exactly as if it were the turn-up card, both for bidding and trick-taking purposes.

Another variant is Oxford Whist. This game is solely for three players and originated in Oxford Road, Bootle, which is how the name was derived. It is played in the same way as Ninety-nine as far as discarding 3 cards to determine the number of tricks required.
This version differs in three ways:

All three discards always remain face down.

A maximum of 10 points is awarded to any player who wins the declared number of tricks.

The leftover cards (2s to 5s) are shuffled and placed in a face-down stock. Before each deal, the top card is turned over to determine trumps.

The game is over when the &#x27;trump stock&#x27; is used up, i.e. 20 deals. The player with the highest score wins.

== Strategy ==

A key to playing ninety-nine well is discarding cards wisely to make a bid. In the two- and three-handed games, three cards must be discarded from twelve, resulting in 220 different options. Players must estimate what will happen to each of the cards they retain, and need to consider important factors such as what suit is trump and who will lead first. Players often want to get rid of &quot;middle&quot; cards, cards that are neither likely winners nor likely losers, and may want to &quot;void&quot; themselves of a suit since, once they have no card in a suit, they are free to play any other card if that suit is led.

One of the most common bids is three, and one of the next most common bids is zero. Diamonds and spades are more likely to be discarded as bid cards than other suits. There will be fewer in play and these suits are less valuable. Few clubs tend to be discarded, making high clubs likely winners.

If a hand is unbiddable and the cards needed to bid with are the cards needed for play, one strategy is to discard surprising cards such as all high cards of a given suit. The player doesn&#x27;t intend to make the bid, and hopes to make it hard for anyone else to make their bids.

Often players want to gain the lead early and play their most uncertain cards first. If they win tricks, they can try to throw away some other strong cards. If the uncertain cards lose, they can try to pick up tricks with stronger cards.

<doc id="247107" wikidata="Q178659" url="?curid=247107" title="Illustration">
<text>An illustration is a decoration, interpretation, or visual explanation of a text, concept, or process, designed for integration in print and digitally published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films. An illustration is typically created by an illustrator. Digital illustrations are often used to make websites and apps more user-friendly, such as the use of emojis to accompany digital type. Illustration also means providing an example; either in writing or in picture form.

The origin of the word &quot;illustration&quot; is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin &quot;illustratio&quot;(n-), from the verb &quot;illustrare&quot;.

== Illustration styles ==

Contemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including drawing, painting, printmaking, collage, montage, digital design, multimedia, 3D modelling. Depending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic, or highly technical.

Specialist areas include:
* Architectural illustration 
* Archaeological illustration
* Book illustration
* Botanical illustration 
* Concept art
* Fashion illustration
* Information graphics
* &quot;Livre d&#x27;art&quot;
* Technical illustration
* Medical illustration
* Narrative illustration
* Picture books
* Scientific illustration

== Technical and scientific illustration ==

Technical and scientific illustration communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include exploded views, cutaways, fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, diagrams. The aim is &quot;to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer&quot;.

Technical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so it must provide &quot;an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer&#x27;s interest and understanding.&quot;

In contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily and reused in a variety of contexts.

There is a Guild of Natural Science Illustrators and Association of Medical Illustrators. The Association of Medical Illustrators states that the median salary is $70,650, while for science illustrators it is $72,277. Types of jobs range from research institutes to museums to animation.

== Illustration as fine art ==

In the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than graphic design and fine art.

Today, however, due in part to the growth of the graphic novel and video game industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.

Original illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist Norman Rockwell&#x27;s painting &quot;Breaking Home Ties&quot; sold in a 2006 Sotheby&#x27;s auction for US$15.4 million. Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as Gil Elvgren and Alberto Vargas, for example, also attracting high prices.

== History ==

Historically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of printing and publishing.

=== Early history ===

The illustrations of medieval codices were known as illuminations, and were individually hand-drawn and painted. With the invention of the printing press during the 15th century, books became more widely distributed, and often illustrated with woodcuts.

Some of the earliest illustrations come from the time of ancient Egypt (Khemet) often as hieroglyph. A classic example of illustrations exists from the time of The Tomb of Pharaoh Seti I, to 1279 BC, who was father of Ramses II, born 1303 BC.

1600s Japan saw the origination of Ukiyo-e, an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed wood block printing technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and everyday life. Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot; is a famous image of the time.

During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were engraving and etching. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was William Blake (1757–1827), who used relief etching. By the early 19th century, the introduction of lithography substantially improved reproduction quality.

=== 19th century ===

In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were John Leech, George Cruikshank, Dickens illustrator Hablot Knight Browne, and, in France, Honoré Daumier. All contributed to both satirical and &quot;serious&quot; publications. At this time, there was a great demand for caricature drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.

The British humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot; (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank&#x27;s &quot;Comic Almanac&quot; (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.

Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term &quot;cartoon&quot; to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to John Leech being known as the world&#x27;s first &quot;cartoonist&quot;. In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian Le Voleur, Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.

=== The &quot;Golden Age&quot; ===

From the early 1800s newspapers, mass-market magazines, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, developments in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing affected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and travel guides, as well as children&#x27;s books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day. Additionally, in the 50-year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.

In America, this led to a &quot;golden age of illustration&quot; from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time. Among the best-known illustrators of that period were N.C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle of the Brandywine School, James Montgomery Flagg, Elizabeth Shippen Green, J. C. Leyendecker, Violet Oakley, Maxfield Parrish, Jessie Willcox Smith, and John Rea Neill.

In France, on 1905, the Contemporary Book Society commissioned Paul Jouve to illustrate Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Jungle Book. Paul Jouve would devote ten years to the 130 illustrations of this book which remains as one of the masterpieces of bibliophilia.

<doc id="247110" wikidata="Q932477" url="?curid=247110" title="Music of Hungary">
<text>Hungary has made many contributions to the fields of folk, popular and classical music. Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music. The Busójárás carnival in Mohács is a major folk music event in Hungary, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded Bogyiszló orchestra. Instruments traditionally used in Hungarian folk music include the citera, cimbalom, cobza, doromb, duda, kanászkürt, tárogató, tambura, tekero and ütőgardon. Traditional Hungarian music has been found to bear resemblances to the musical traditions of neighbouring Balkan countries and Central Asia.

Hungarian classical music has long been an &quot;experiment, made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious [variant of] musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song&quot;. Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century, Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, two of Hungary&#x27;s most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their music. Bartók collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe, including Croatia, Czechia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Serbia, whilst Kodály was more interested in uncovering a distinctively Hungarian musical style.

One of the most significant musical genres in Hungary is Romani music, with a historical presence dating back many centuries. Hungarian Romani music is an integral part of the national culture, and it has become increasingly popular throughout the country. 

During the era of Communist rule in Hungary (1949–1989) a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of jazz such as trumpeter Rudolf Tomsits, pianist-composer Károly Binder and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, Ferenc Sebő and Márta Sebestyén. The three giants of Hungarian rock, Illés, Metró and Omega, remain very popular.

==Characteristics==

Unlike most European peoples, the Hungarian people, Magyars, emerged from the intermingling of Ugric and Eastern Turkic peoples during the fifth to eighth centuries AD. This makes the origins of their traditional music unique in Europe. According to author Simon Broughton, the composer and song collector Kodály identified songs that &quot;apparently date back 2,500 years&quot; in common with the Mari people of Russia; and, as well as the Mari, the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl indicates similarities in traditional Hungarian music with Mongolian and Native American musical styles. Bence Szabolcsi, however, claims that the Finno-Ugric and Turkish-Mongolian elements are present but &quot;cannot be attached to certain, definite national or linguistic groups&quot;. Nonetheless, Szabolcsi claims links between Hungarian musical traditions and those of the Mari, Kalmyk, Ostyak, northwest Chinese, Tatar, Vogul, Anatolian Turkish, Bashkirian, Mongol and Chuvash musics. These, he claims, are evidence that &quot;Asian memories slumber in the depths of Hungarian folk music and that this folk music is the last Western link in the chain of ancient Eastern cultural relations&quot;.

According to Broughton, traditional Hungarian music is &quot;highly distinctive&quot; like the Hungarian language, which invariably is stressed on the first syllable, lending a strongly accented dactylic rhythm to the music&quot;. Nettl identifies two &quot;essential features&quot; of Hungarian folk music to be the use of &quot;pentatonic scales composed of major seconds and minor thirds&quot; (or &quot;gapped scales&quot;) and &quot;the practice of transposing a bit of melody several times to create the essence of a song&quot;. These transpositions are &quot;usually up or down a fifth&quot;, a fundamental interval in the series of overtones and an indication perhaps of the &quot;influence of Chinese musical theory in which the fifth is significant&quot;.

According to Szabolcsi, these &#x27;Hungarian transpositions&#x27;, along with &quot;some melodic, rhythmical and ornamental peculiarities, clearly show on the map of Eurasia the movements of Turkish people from the East to the West&quot;. The subsequent influence on neighbouring countries&#x27; music is seen in the music of Slovakia, Poland, and, with intervals of the third or second, in the music of the Czech Republic. Hungarian and Finnoic musical traditions are also characterised by the use of an ABBA binary musical form, with Hungary itself especially known for the A A&#x27; A&#x27; A variant, where the B sections are the A sections transposed up or down a fifth (A&#x27;). Modern Hungarian folk music evolved in the 19th century, and is contrasted with previous styles through the use of arched melodic lines as opposed to the more archaic descending lines.

==Music history==
The earliest documentation of Hungarian music dates from the introduction of Gregorian chant in the 11th century. By that time, Hungary had begun to enter the European cultural establishment with the country&#x27;s conversion to Christianity and the musically important importation of plainsong, a form of Christian chant. Though Hungary&#x27;s early religious musical history is relatively well documented, secular music remains mostly unknown, though it was apparently a common feature of community festivals and other events. The earliest documented instrumentation in Hungary dates back to the whistle in 1222, the Koboz around 1237-1325, the bugle in 1355, the fiddle in 1358, the bagpipe in 1402, the lute in 1427 and the trumpet in 1428. Thereafter the organ came to play a major role.

The 16th century saw the rise of Transylvania as a centre for Hungarian music. It also saw the first publication of music in Hungary, in Kraków. At this time Hungarian instrumental music was well known in Europe; the lutenist and composer Bálint Bakfark, for example, was famed as a virtuoso player. His compositions pioneered a new style of writing for the lute based on vocal polyphony. The lutenist brothers Melchior and Konrad Neusiedler were also noted, as was Stephan Monetarius, the author of an important early work in music theory, the &quot;Epithoma utriusque musices&quot;.

During the 16th century, Hungary was divided into three parts: an area controlled by the Turks; an Ottoman vassal state (the Principality of Transylvania); and an area controlled by the Habsburgs. Historic songs declined in popularity and were replaced by lyrical poetry, whilst minstrels were replaced by court musicians. Many courts or households maintained large ensembles of musicians who played the trumpet, whistle, cimbalom, violin or bagpipes. Some of these ensemble musicians were German, Polish, French or Italian; the court of Gábor Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania, included a Spanish guitarist. Little detail about the music played during this era survives, however. Musical life in the areas controlled by the Ottoman Turks declined precipitously, with even the formerly widespread and entrenched plainsong style disappearing by the end of the 17th century. Outside of the Ottoman area, however, plainsong flourished after the establishment of Protestant missions in around 1540, while a similarly styled form of folk song called verse chronicles also arose.
During the 18th century, some of the students at colleges such as those in Sárospatak and Székelyudvarhely were minor nobles from rural areas who brought with them their regional styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, the students&#x27; songbooks indicate a growth in the popularity of homophonic songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of Ádám Pálóczi Horváth’s &quot;Ötödfélszáz Énekek&quot; in 1853. These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians looked more to other (Western) European styles for influence.

The 18th century also saw the rise of verbunkos, a form of music initially used by army recruiters. Like much Hungarian music of the time, melody was treated as more important than lyrics, although this balance changed as verbunkos became more established.
==Folk music==

Hungarian folk music changed greatly beginning in the 19th century, evolving into a new style that had little in common with the music that came before it. Modern Hungarian music was characterised by an &quot;arched melodic line, strict composition, long phrases and extended register&quot;, in contrast to the older styles which always utilize a &quot;descending melodic line&quot;.

Modern Hungarian folk music was first recorded in 1895 by Béla Vikár, setting the stage for the pioneering work of Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály and László Lajtha in musicological collecting. Modern Hungarian folk music began its history with the Habsburg Empire in the 18th century, when central European influences became paramount, including a &quot;regular metric structure for dancing and marching instead of the free speech rhythms of the old style. Folk music at that time consisting of village bagpipers who were replaced by string-based orchestras of the Gypsy, or Roma people.

In the 19th century, Roma orchestras became very well known throughout Europe, and were frequently thought of as the primary musical heritage of Hungary, as in Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; and &quot;Rhapsodies&quot;, which used Hungarian Roma music as representative of Hungarian folk music Hungarian Romani music is often represented as the only music of the Roma, though multiple forms of Roma music are common throughout Europe and are often dissimilar to Hungarian forms. In the Hungarian language, 19th-century folk styles like the csardas and the verbunkos, are collectively referred to as &quot;cigányzene&quot;, which translates literally as &quot;Gypsy music&quot;.

Hungarian nationalist composers, like Bartók, rejected the conflation of Hungarian and Roma music, studying the rural peasant songs of Hungary which, according to music historian Bruno Nettl, &quot;has little in common with&quot; Roma music, a position that is held to by some modern writers, such as the Hungarian author Bálint Sárosi. Simon Broughton, however, has claimed that Roma music is &quot;no less Hungarian and... has more in common with peasant music than the folklorists like to admit&quot;, and authors Marian Cotton and Adelaide Bradburn claimed that Hungarian-Roma music was &quot;perhaps... originally Hungarian in character, but (the Roma have made so many changes that) it is difficult to tell what is Hungarian and what is&quot; the authentic music of the Roma.

The ethnic Csángó Hungarians of Moldavia&#x27;s Seret Valley have moved in large numbers to Budapest, and become a staple of the local folk scene with their distinctive instrumentation using flutes, fiddles, drums and the lute.

Prominent folk ensembles, such as the Hungaria Folk Orchestra, the Danube Folk Ensemble and the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble have regular performances in Budapest and are a popular attraction for visitors.

===Verbunkos===
In the 19th century, verbunkos was the most popular style in Hungary. This consisted of a slow dance followed by a faster dance; this dichotomy, between the slower and faster dances, has been seen as the &quot;two contrasting aspects of the Hungarian character&quot;. The rhythmic patterns and embellishments of the verbunkos are distinctively Hungarian in nature, and draw heavily upon the folk music composed in the early part of the century by Antal Csermak, Ferdinand Kauer, Janos Lavotta and others.

Verbunkos was originally played at recruitment ceremonies to convince young men to join the army, and was performed, as in so much of Hungarian music, by Roma bands. One verbunkos tune, the &quot;Rákóczi March&quot; became a march that was a prominent part of compositions by both Liszt and Hector Berlioz. The 18th-century origins of verbunkos are not well known, but probably include old dances like the swine-herd dance and the Hajduk dance, as well as elements of Balkan, Slavic and Levantine music, and the cultured music of Italy and Vienna, all filtered through the Roma performers. Verbunkos became wildly popular, not just among the poor peasantry, but also among the upper-class aristocratics, who saw verbunkos as the authentic music of the Hungarian nation. Characteristics of verbunkos include the bokázó (&quot;clicking of heels&quot;) cadence-pattern, the use of the interval of the augmented second, garlands of triplets, widely arched, free melodies without words, and alternately swift and slow tempi. By the end of the 18th century, verbunkos was in use in opera, chamber and piano music, and in song literature, and was regarded as &quot;the continuation, the resurrection of ancient Hungarian dance and music, and its success signified the triumph of the people&#x27;s art&quot;.

The violinist Panna Czinka was among the most celebrated musicians of the 19th century, as was the Roma bandleader János Bihari, known as the &quot;Napoleon of the fiddle&quot;. Bihari, Antal Csermák and other composers helped make verbunkos the &quot;most important expression of the Hungarian musical Romanticism&quot; and have it &quot;the role of national music&quot;. Bihari was especially important in popularizing and innovating the verbunkos; he was the &quot;incarnation of the musical demon of fiery imagination&quot;. Bihari and others after his death helped invent nóta, a popular form written by composers like Lóránd Fráter, Árpád Balázs, Pista Dankó, Béni Egressy, Márk Rózsavölgyi and Imre Farkas. Many of the biggest names in modern Hungarian music are the verbunkos-playing Lakatos family, including Sándor Lakatos and Roby Lakatos.

===Roma music===

Though the Roma are primarily known as the performers of Hungarian styles like verbunkos, they have their own form of folk music that is largely without instrumentation, in spite of their reputation in that field outside of the Roma community. Roma music tends to take on characteristics of whatever music the people are around, however, embellished with &quot;twists and turns, trills and runs&quot;, making a very new, and distinctively Roma style. Though without instruments, Roma folk musicians use sticks, tapped on the ground, rhythmic grunts and a technique called oral-bassing which vocally imitates the sound of instruments. Some modern Roma musicians, like Ando Drom, Romano Drom, Romani Rota and Kalyi Jag have added modern instruments like guitars to the Roma style, while Gyula Babos&#x27; Project Romani has used elements of avant-garde jazz.

===Hungarian music abroad===

Ethnic Hungarians live in parts of the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Slovenia, and elsewhere. Of these, the Hungarian population of Romania (both in the region of Transylvania and among the Csángó people) - being the more rural, outer rims of the kingdom of Hungary - has had the most musical impact on Hungarian folk music. The Hungarian community in Slovakia has produced the roots revival band Ghymes, who play in the táncház tradition. The Serbian region of Vojvodina is home to a large Hungarian minority

Transylvanian folk music remains vital part of life in modern Transylvania. Bartók and Kodály found Transylvania to be a fertile area for folk song collecting. Folk bands are usually a string trio, consisting of a violin, viola and double bass, occasionally with a cimbalom; the first violin, or &quot;primás&quot;, plays the melody, with the others accompanying and providing the rhythm. Transylvania is also the original home of the táncház tradition, which has since spread throughout Hungary.

===Táncház===

Táncház (literally &quot;dance house&quot;) is a dance music movement which first appeared in the 1970s as a reaction against state-supported homogenised and sanitised folk music. They have been described as a &quot;cross between a barn dance and folk club&quot;, and generally begin with a slow tempo &quot;verbunkos&quot; (recruiting dance), followed by swifter &quot;csárdás&quot; dances. Csárdás is a very popular Hungarian folk dance that comes in many regional varieties, and is characterized by changes in tempo. Táncház began with the folk song collecting of musicians like Béla Halmos and Ferenc Sebő, who collected rural instrumental and dance music for popular, urban consumption, along with the dance collectors György Martin and Sándor Timár. The most important rural source of these songs was Transylvania, which is actually in Romania but has a large ethnic Hungarian minority. The instrumentation of these bands, based on Transylvanian and sometimes the southern Slovak Hungarian communities, included a fiddle on lead with violin, a kontra (a 3-string viola also called a &quot;brácsa&quot;), and bowed double bass, and sometimes a cimbalom as well.

Many of the biggest names in modern Hungarian music emerged from the táncház scene, including Muzsikás and Márta Sebestyén. Other bands include Vujicsics, Jánosi, Téka and Kalamajka, while singers include Éva Fábián and András Berecz. Famous instrumentalists include fiddlers Csaba Ökrös and Balázs Vizeli, cimbalomist Kálmán Balogh, violinist Félix Lajkó (from Subotica in Serbia) and multi-instrumentalist Mihály Dresch.
==Classical music==
Hungary&#x27;s most important contribution to the worldwide field of European classical music is probably Franz Liszt, a renowned pianist in his own time and a well-regarded composer of 19 &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot; and a number of symphonic poems such as &quot;Les préludes&quot;. Liszt was among the major composers during the late 19th century, a time when modern Hungarian classical music was in its formative stage. Along with Liszt and his French Romantic tendencies, Ferenc Erkel&#x27;s Italian and French-style operas, with Hungarian words, and Mihály Mosonyi&#x27;s German classical style, helped set the stage for future music, and their influence is &quot;unsurpassed even by their successors, because in addition to their individual abilities they bring about an unprecedented artistic intensification of the Romantic musical idiom, which is practically consumed by this extreme passion&quot;. Elements of Hungarian folk music, especially verbunkos, became important elements of many composers, both Hungarians like Kalman Simonffy and foreign composers like Johannes Brahms and Ludwig van Beethoven.

Hungary has also produced Karl Goldmark, composer of the &quot;Rustic Wedding Symphony&quot;, composer and pianist Ernő Dohnányi, composer and ethnomusicologist László Lajtha, and the piano composer Stephen Heller. A number of violinists from Hungary have also achieved international renown, especially Joseph Joachim, Tivadar Nachéz, Jenő Hubay, Edward Reményi, Sándor Végh, Franz von Vecsey, Ede Zathureczky, Emil Telmányi, Tibor Varga and Leopold Auer. Hungarian-born conductors include Antal Doráti; ; Eugene Ormandy; Fritz Reiner; George Szell and Georg Solti, Ádám Fischer and Iván Fischer, as well as Gregory Vajda.
Pianists of international renown: Géza Anda, Tamás Vásáry, Georges Cziffra, Annie Fischer, Zoltán Kocsis, Dezső Ránki, András Schiff and Jenő Jandó

===Hungarian opera===

The origins of Hungarian opera can be traced to the late 18th century, with the rise of imported opera and other concert styles in cities like Pozsony, Kismarton, Nagyszeben and Budapest. Operas at the time were in either the German or Italian style. The field Hungarian opera began with school dramas and interpolations of German operas, which began at the end of the 18th century. School dramas in places like the Pauline School in Sátoraljaújhely, the Calvinist School in Csurgó and the Piarist School in Beszterce.

Pozsony produced the first music drama experiments in the country, though the work of Gáspár Pacha and József Chudy; it was the latter&#x27;s 1793 &quot;Prince Pikkó and Jutka Perzsi&quot; that is generally considered the first opera in a distinctively Hungarian style. The text of that piece was translated from &quot;Prinz Schnudi und Prinzessin Evakathel&quot; by Philipp Hafner. This style was still strongly informed by the Viennese Zauberposse style of comedic play, and remained thus throughout the 19th century. Though these operas used foreign styles, the &quot;idyllic, lyric and heroic&quot; parts of the story were always based on verbunkos, which was becoming a symbol of the Hungarian nation during this time. It was not until the middle of the 19th century that Ferenc Erkel wrote the first Hungarian language opera, using French and Italian models, thus launching the field of Hungarian opera.

===Bartók and Kodály===

At the end of the 19th century, Hungarian music was dominated by compositions in the German classical style, while Viennese-style operettas gained immensely in popularity. This ended beginning in about 1905, when Endre Ady&#x27;s poems were published, composer Béla Bartók was published for the first time, and Zoltán Kodály began collecting folk songs. Bartók and Kodály were two exceptional composers who created a distinctively Hungarian style. Bartók collected songs across Eastern Europe, though much of his activity was in Hungary, and he used their elements in his music. He was interested in all forms of folk music, while Kodály was more specifically Hungarian in his outlook. In contrast to previous composers who worked with Hungarian popular musical idioms, Kodály and Bartók drew a sharp line between the popular music played by Roma (also known as &quot;magyarnóta&quot;, or Hungarian music or Gypsy music) and the music of farmers. Their work was a watershed that incorporated &quot;every great tradition of the Hungarian people&quot; and influenced all the later composers of the country.

===Later 20th century===
For the first half of the 20th century, Bartók and Kodály were potent symbols for a generation of composers, especially Kodály. Starting in about 1947, a revival in folk choir music began, ended as an honest force by 1950, when state-run art became dominant with the rise of Communism. Under Communism, &quot;(c)ommitment and ideological affiliation (were) measured by the musical style of a composer; the ignominious adjectives &#x27;formalistic&#x27; and &#x27;cosmopolitan&#x27; gain currency ... (and the proper Hungarian style was) identified with the major mode, the classical aria, rondo or sonata form, the chord sequences distilled&quot; from Kodály&#x27;s works. Music was uniformly festive and optimistic, with every deviation arousing suspicion; this simplicity led to a lack of popular support from the public, who did not identify with the sterile approved styles. The most prominent composers of this period were Endre Szervánszky, Ferenc Szabó and Lajos Bárdos.

Beginning in about 1955, a new wave of composers appeared, inspired by Bartók and breathing new life into Hungarian music. Composers from this era included András Mihály, Endre Szervánszky, Pál Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas and György Ránki. These composers both brought back old techniques of Hungarian music, as well as adapting imported avant-garde and modernist elements of Western classical music. György Ligeti and György Kurtág are often mentioned in the same sentence. They were born near each other in Transylvania and studied in Budapest in the 1940s. Both were influenced by Stockhausen. Kurtág&#x27;s modernism borrowed many influences from the past. By contrast Ligeti invented a new language with chromatic tone clusters and elements of parody. Both were multi-lingual and became exiles. This is reflected in the texts for their works. The foundation of the New Music Studio in 1970 helped further modernise Hungarian classical music though promoting composers that felt audience education was as important a consideration as artistic merit in composition and performance; these Studio&#x27;s well-known composers include László Vidovszky, László Sáry and Zoltán Jeney. Miklós Rózsa, who studied in Germany and eventually settled in the United States, achieved international recognition for his Hollywood film scores as well as his concert music.

==Popular music==
Hungarian popular music in the early 20th century consisted of light operettas and the Roma music of various styles. Nagymező utca, the &quot;Broadway of Budapest&quot;, was a major centre for popular music, and boasted enough nightclubs and theatres to earn its nickname. In 1945, however, this era abruptly ended and popular music was mostly synonymous with the patriotic songs imposed by the Russian Communists. Some operettas were still performed, though infrequently, and any music with Western influences was seen as harmful and dangerous. In 1956, however, liberalisation began with the &quot;three Ts&quot; (&quot;tiltás, tűrés, támogatás&quot;, meaning &quot;prohibition, toleration, support&quot;&quot;&quot;), and a long period of cultural struggle began, starting with a battle over African American jazz. Jazz became a part of Hungarian music in the early 20th century, and although common place in Budapest&#x27;s venues such as the Tabarin, the Astoria and Central Cafe which set up its own coffee jazz band, it has not achieved widespread renown until the 1970s, when Hungary began producing internationally known performers like the Benkó Dixieland Band and Béla Szakcsi Lakatos. Other renowned performers from the younger generation are the Hot Jazz Band and the Bohém Ragtime Jazz Band.

===Rock===

In the early 1960s, Hungarian youths began listening to rock in droves, in spite of condemnation from the authorities. Three bands dominated the scene by the beginning of the 1970s, Illés, Metró and Omega, all three of which had released at least one album. A few other bands recorded a few singles, but the Record-Producing Company, a state-run record label, did not promote or support these bands, which quickly disappeared.

In 1968, the New Economic Mechanism was introduced, intending on revitalising the Hungarian economy, while the band Illés won almost every prize at the prestigious Táncdalfesztivál. In the 1970s, however, the hard-liners of the Communist party cracked down on dissidence in Hungary, and rock was a major target. The band Illés was banned from performing and recording, while Metró and Omega left. Some of the members of these bands formed a supergroup, Locomotiv GT, that quickly became very famous. The remaining members of Omega, meanwhile, succeeded in achieving stardom in Germany, and remained very popular for a time.

Rock bands in the late 1970s had to conform to the Record Company&#x27;s demands and ensure that all songs passed the inspection of the Song Committee, who scoured all songs looking for hidden political messages. LGT was the most prominent band of a classic rock style that was very popular, along with Illés, Bergendy and Zorán, while there were other bands like The Sweet and Middle of the Road who catered to the desires of the Song Committee, producing rock-based pop music without a hint of subversion. Meanwhile, the disco style of electronic music produced such performers as the expensively produced and managed Neoton Familia, Beatrice and Szűcs Judit, while the more critically acclaimed progressive rock scene produced bands like East, V73, Color and Panta Rhei.

In the early 1980s, economic depression wracked Hungary, leading to a wave of politically disillusioned and alienated yet vibrant youth culture, a crucial part of which were hard rock, punk, new wave and art rock. Major bands from this era included Beatrice, who had moved from disco to punk and folk-influenced rock and were known for their splashy, uncensored and theatrical performances, P. Mobil, Bikini, Hobo Blues Band, A. E. Bizottság, Európa Kiadó, Sziámi and Edda művek. The first major prison sentences for rock-related subversion were given out, with the members of the punk band CPg sentenced to two years for political incitement.

As the communist system was falling apart, the Hungarian Record Company (MHV) was privatized and smaller independent labels such as Bahia and Human Telex were formed. Major multinational companies such as EMI established headquarters in Budapest. Hungarian popular music became incorporated into the global music industry.

===Electronic music===
Clubbing and electronic dance music started gaining popularity in Hungary following the change of regime in 1989 and corresponding to Electronic music&#x27;s increasing popularity in the worldwide musical mainstream. The political freedom and cultural boom of western culture opened the way for the clubbing scene, with several venues starting all around the country, especially in Budapest and around Lake Balaton.

The 1990s also marked the creation of several dance formations, notably Soho Party, Splash, Náksi &amp; Brunner and also rave formations such as Emergency House and Kozmix. Notable techno and house DJ-s are Sterbinszky, Budai, and Newl. The workings of the scene culminated in events like Budapest Parade, the largest such street festival in Hungary, that was held yearly from 2000 to 2006, attracting more than half million visitors. The history of Electronic Dance Music and Techno culture in Hungary is documented in Ferenc Kömlődy&#x27;s book &quot;Fénykatedrális&quot;, (1999 in Hungarian).

A thriving underground scene was marked by the start of Tilos Rádió in 1991, the first free independent community station, starting out as a pirate radio. The station soon developed strong ties with the first alternative electronic formations, and inspired to start many others. Bands like Korai Öröm and Másfél (also check Myster Mobius) started, playing ambient, psychedelic music. Anima Sound System, one of the most influential bands on the scene, was created in 1993 playing dub and trip-hop influenced by acid jazz and ethnic music. Several other bands and formations followed, like Colorstar and Neo. Neo has won a worldwide reputation for their unique electro-pop style and the &quot;Mozart of pop music&quot; award (Cannes, 2004) they received for their soundtrack album called &quot;Control&quot;. Apart from Anima, ethnic and folk influenced the scene in many ways, exemplified by formations like Balkan Fanatik, or Mitsoura. One of the most successful Hungarian electronic musician is Yonderboi, who recently co-created Žagar, gaining wide reputation in the country. In the past few years, dubstep has gained popular attention as well, nationwide.

Experimental and minimal scene is in its early age, although several crews and DJs are working, organising numerous events. Notable performers include c0p, Cadik, Ferenc Vaspöeri and Isu.

===Hip hop===

Hip hop and rap have been developing in Hungary with two scenes, underground and mainstream, which is mostly popular among young people in Hungary. Underground rappers condemn the mainstream for &quot;selling&quot; their music and usually provide deeper message. Mainstream hip hop is dominated by the pioneer of Gangsta rap in Hungary, Ganxsta Zolee, and there are also other famous ones including FankaDeli, Sub Bass Monster, Dope Man, and LL Junior. Mainstream hip-hop is extremely popular among the Romani youth.

Bëlga started as an offshoot hiphop project at Tilos Rádió. As lyrical innovators and phenomenal parodists, they gained wide popularity for an extremely explicit criticism of Budapest public transport company BKV, as well as hilarious wordplays and self-irony. Their lyrics are significant beyond the hip-hop scope as a cultural documentation of turn-of-the-millennia Culture of Hungary.

Hungarian Slam sessions are rare and few, and still a novelty for the mainstream, but are gaining popularity with literary performers, emcees and audiences alike.

===Hardcore, metal===
Despite being unknown among most Hungarian people, hardcore and metal are flourishing styles of music in Hungary. Metal bands are formed all over the country. Dominant styles are death metal, black metal and thrash. There are also power metal, folk metal and heavy metal groups, including Dalriada and Thy Catafalque.

Hardcore and metalcore are most common in Budapest and Western Hungary, in towns like Győr, Csorna, Szombathely and Veszprém, but Eastern Hungary and Debrecen is getting into a more and more important place in the hardcore scene. The first Hungarian acts that tagged themselves Hardcore like AMD, Leukémia, Marina revue emerged in the late 1980s, and were followed by a number of acts, constituting a scene that flourishes since the early 1990s. Notable bands were Dawncore and Newborn of the late 1990s gaining also some international success. Members of these bands went on to form Bridge to Solace and The Idoru. Other important, active bands: Hold X True, Fallenintoashes, Embers, Suicide Pride, Subscribe, Road, Shell Beach, Hatred Solution, Blind Myself, Superbutt, Stillborn (Hatebreed tribute). An internationally known band is Ektomorf, infusing heavy ethnic content with harsh vocals, One of North America&#x27;s most popular metal band with record sales over two million albums; Five Finger Death Punch was formed by the Hungarian born, Golden God Shredder Award winning guitarist Zoltan Bathory

Extreme hardcorepunk and grindcore bands from Hungary include Jack (crustgrind), Human Error(crustcore), Step On It (allschool hardcore), Another Way (fastcore), Gyalázat (crustpunk).

===Indie===

The origins of the Hungarian indie music scene go back to the early 1980s when Európa Kiadó, Sziami and Balaton released their records. The first revival took place in the mid-1990s when bands like Sexepil gained international success, followed by Heaven Street Seven. The second and most notable revival of the indie-alternative scene took place in the mid-2000s when bands like Amber Smith, The Moog signed to international labels. Other notable bands include EZ Basic, The KOLIN and Dawnstar. The Hungarian indie scene is closely intertwined with electronic music therefore artists like Yonderboi and Žagar are often considered part of the indie scene.

The Hungarian indie music has its special, Hungarian languaged line. It is based rather on 1980s bands like Európa Kiadó or Neurotic. The most notable bands and artists are Kispál és a borz (the lead singer and songwriter András Lovasi was honored by the Kossuth Prize), Hiperkarma (Róbert Bérczesi made alone the first album), and Quimby (most notable member is Tibor Kiss).

===Punk===
The origins of the Hungarian punk movement go back to the early eighties, when a handful of bands like &quot;ETA&quot;, &quot;QSS&quot;, &quot;CPG&quot;, and &quot;Auróra&quot; emerged as angry young men playing fast and raw punk rock music. Like many other musicians of their age, they often criticised the communist government. They were a part of the national movement to reject the oppressiveness, and particularly the censorship, of the communist regime. As their music was on the verge of acceptance both by the public and the authorities, concerts were held under tight police control, and often caused moral outrage. With band members often living under constant surveillance, prison was a serious possibility. Two members of the band &quot;CPG&quot; were found guilty and sent to prison for two years for allegedly unmoral lyrics. After their release, they had to leave Hungary, as did &quot;Auróra&quot;’s lead singer.

The change of regime in 1989 brought a new situation, and bands now revolted against corruption and the Americanisation of the country. They felt that the new system retained the bad things from the previous one, but lacked that good things that many expected. In lyrics, they often mention the newly appearing organised crime, and the still low standard of living.

Today the Hungarian punk scene is low profile, but vibrant with several active bands, often touring the country and beyond. Summer brings a slew of punk and alternative festivals where they can all be sampled. Top venues playing punk music around Budapest include Vörös Yuk, Borgödör, &quot;Music Factory&quot; and A38 Hajó.

Major bands include Auróra, the oldest Hungarian punk band with twenty-five years of history, come from the northwest Hungarian town of Győr and their originally street punk music has been recently updated with a ska-punk flavor, HétköznaPI CSAlódások (also called PICSA), a simplistic but powerful punk band, most popular in the end of the 1990s. They, similarly to &quot;Junkies&quot;, &quot;Fürgerókalábak&quot;, and &quot;Prosectura&quot;, are part of the new wave of punk bands that had risen in the mid-late 1990s in Hungary. Out of the newer bands, two northeast Hungarian bands are the most known, both playing California punk: Alvin és a mókusok come from Nyíregyháza, while Macskanadrág are from Salgótarján.

==Festivals, venues and other institutions==
===Folk and classical music===
Budapest, the capital and music centre of Hungary, is one of the best places to go in Hungary to hear &quot;really good folk music&quot;, says world music author Simon Broughton. The city is home to an annual folk festival called Táncháztalálkozó (&quot;Meeting of the Táncházak&quot;, literally &quot;dance houses&quot;), which is a major part of the modern music scene. The Budapest Spring Festival along with the Budapest Autumn Festival are large scale cultural events every year. The Budapesti Fesztivál Zenekar (Budapest Festival Orchestra) has recently been awarded the Editor&#x27;s Choice Gramophone Award. Long-standing venues in Budapest include the Philharmonic Society (founded 1853), the Opera House of Budapest (founded 1884) the Academy of Music, which opened in 1875 with President Franz Liszt and Director Ferenc Erkel and which has remained the centre for music education in the country since.

===Popular music festivals===

Several musical festivals have been launched since the early 1990s propelled by increasing demand of the developing youth culture. Aside from country-wide events like Sziget Festival or Hegyalja Festival, local festivals started to emerge since the first half of the first decade of the new millennium, with the aim to showcase known bands in all regions of Hungary.

Growing out of a low-profile student meeting in 1993, Sziget Festival became one of the largest open-air festival in the world, taking place each summer in the heart of Budapest, the 108 hectare Óbudai island. Visited by hundreds of thousands from all over Europe, it is the largest cultural event in Hungary, inviting world-class performers from all genres.

Also having a history from 1993, VOLT Festival is the second-largest music festival in the country, held each year in Sopron. With a colorful mix of musical styles, and popularity increasing each year, is considered to be the &quot;cheaper version&quot; of Sziget. Also founded by the Sziget management, Balaton Sound is a festival of mainly electronic music, held yearly in Zamárdi, next to Lake Balaton. With prestigious performers and exclusive surroundings, it tries to position itself as a high-standard event.

Hegyalja Festival, held in Tokaj, the historic wine-region of the country, is the largest such event in the Northern part. Visited by 50.000 guests each year, it showcases mainly hard rock and rock formations, but many more genres are present. BalaTone, another major event near lake Balaton is held in Zánka. Magyar Sziget, held in Verőce, has a nationalist theme, with mainly right-wing performers, bands representing the recently emerged nationalistic rock, folk and folk-rock.

As a tradition, each larger University (or more precisely, its students&#x27; union) holds a periodical music festival, &quot;University Days&quot;, of various size, the largest one is PEN (of the University of Pécs). Examples of smaller, local festivals are SZIN held in Szeged, the free Utcazene Fesztivál held on the streets of Veszprém, Pannónia Fesztivál in Várpalota, or the recently (2008) started Fishing on Orfű, held on the beach of the Orfű lake.

===Funding===
The Hungarian Ministry of Culture helps to fund some forms of music, as does the government-run National Cultural Fund. Non-profit organisations in Hungary include the Hungarian Jazz Alliance and the Hungarian Music Council.

<text>In accounting, revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business.
Commercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other fees. &quot;Revenue&quot; may refer to income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit, earned during a period of time, as in &quot;Last year, company X had revenue of $42 million&quot;. Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total expenses in a given period. In accounting, revenue is a subsection of the equity section of the balance statement, since it increases equity. It is often referred to as the &quot;top line&quot; due to its position at the very top of the income statement. This is to be contrasted with the &quot;bottom line&quot; which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses).

In general usage, revenue is the total amount of income by the sale of goods or services related to the company&#x27;s operations. Sales revenue is income received from selling goods or services over a period of time. Tax revenue is income that a government receives from taxpayers. Fundraising revenue is income received by a charity from donors etc. to further its social purposes.

In more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income based on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a government or government agency. Two common accounting methods, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for measuring revenue. Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are usually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting principles or on International Financial Reporting Standards.

In a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger accounts that are summarized periodically under the heading &quot;revenue&quot; or &quot;revenues&quot; on an income statement. Revenue account-names describe the type of revenue, such as &quot;repair service revenue&quot;, &quot;rent revenue earned&quot; or &quot;sales&quot;.

== Non-profit organizations ==
For non-profit organizations, revenue may be referred to as gross receipts, support, contributions, etc. This operating revenue can include donations from individuals and corporations, support from government agencies, income from activities related to the organization&#x27;s mission, income from fundraising activities, and membership dues. Revenue (income and gains) from investments may be categorized as &quot;operating&quot; or &quot;non-operating&quot;—but for many non-profits must (simultaneously) be categorized by fund (along with other accounts).

=== Association dues revenue ===

For non-profits with substantial revenue from the dues of their voluntary members: non-dues revenue is revenue generated through means besides association membership fees. This revenue can be found through means of sponsorships, donations or outsourcing the association&#x27;s digital media outlets.

==Business revenue==
Business revenue is money income from activities that are ordinary for a particular corporation, company, partnership, or sole-proprietorship. For some businesses, such as manufacturing or grocery, most revenue is from the sale of goods. Service businesses such as law firms and barber shops receive most of their revenue from rendering services. Lending businesses such as car rentals and banks receive most of their revenue from fees and interest generated by lending assets to other organizations or individuals.

Revenues from a business&#x27;s primary activities are reported as sales, sales revenue or net sales. This includes product returns and discounts for early payment of invoices. Most businesses also have revenue that is incidental to the business&#x27;s primary activities, such as interest earned on deposits in a demand account. This is included in revenue but not included in net sales. Sales revenue does not include sales tax collected by the business.

Other revenue (a.k.a. non-operating revenue) is revenue from peripheral (non-core) operations. For example, a company that manufactures and sells automobiles would record the revenue from the sale of an automobile as &quot;regular&quot; revenue. If that same company also rented a portion of one of its buildings, it would record that revenue as &quot;other revenue&quot; and disclose it separately on its income statement to show that it is from something other than its core operations. The combination of all the revenue-generating systems of a business is called its revenue model.

=== Accounting terms ===
* Net sales = gross sales – (customer discounts, returns, and allowances)
* Gross profit = net sales – cost of goods sold
* Operating profit = gross profit – total operating expenses
* Net profit = operating profit – taxes – interest
* Net profit = net sales – cost of goods sold – operating expense – taxes – interest
* EBIT = net profit + taxes + interest
* EBITDA = net profit + taxes + interest + depreciation + amortization

=== Accounting ===
While the current IFRS conceptual framework no longer draws a distinction between revenue and gains, it continues to be drawn at the standard and reporting levels. For example, IFRS 9.5.7.1 states: &quot;A gain or loss on a financial asset or financial liability that is measured at fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss ...&quot; while the IASB defined IFRS XBRL taxonomy includes OtherGainsLosses, GainsLossesOnNetMonetaryPosition and similar items.

===Financial statement analysis===

Revenue is a crucial part of financial statement analysis. The company&#x27;s performance is measured to the extent to which its asset inflows (revenues) compare with its asset outflows (expenses). Net income is the result of this equation, but revenue typically enjoys equal attention during a standard earnings call. If a company displays solid &quot;top-line growth&quot;, analysts could view the period&#x27;s performance as positive even if earnings growth, or &quot;bottom-line growth&quot; is stagnant. Conversely, high net income growth would be tainted if a company failed to produce significant revenue growth. Consistent revenue growth, if accompanied by net income growth, contributes to the value of an enterprise and therefore the share price.

Revenue is used as an indication of earnings quality. There are several financial ratios attached to it:
*The most important being gross margin and profit margin; also, companies use revenue to determine bad debt expense using the income statement method.
*Price / Sales is sometimes used as a substitute for a price to earnings ratio when earnings are negative and the P/E is meaningless. Though a company may have negative earnings, it almost always has positive revenue.
*Gross margin is a calculation of revenue less the cost of goods sold, and is used to determine how well sales cover direct variable costs relating to the production of goods.
*Net income/sales, or profit margin, is calculated by investors to determine how efficiently a company turns revenues into profits.

== Government revenue ==

Government revenue includes all amounts of money (i.e., taxes and fees) received from sources outside the government entity. Large governments usually have an agency or department responsible for collecting government revenue from companies and individuals.

Government revenue may also include reserve bank currency which is printed. This is recorded as an advance to the retail bank together with a corresponding currency in circulation expense entry, that is, the income derived from the Official Cash rate payable by the retail banks for instruments such as 90-day bills. There is a question as to whether using generic business-based accounting standards can give a fair and accurate picture of government accounts, in that with a monetary policy statement to the reserve bank directing a positive inflation rate, the expense provision for the return of currency to the reserve bank is largely symbolic, such that to totally cancel the currency in circulation provision, all currency would have to be returned to the reserve bank and canceled.

<doc id="247121" wikidata="Q852210" url="?curid=247121" title="Music of Romania">
<text>Romania has a multicultural music environment which includes active ethnic music scenes. Traditional Romanian folk music remains popular, and some folk musicians have come to national (and even international) fame.

== History ==
Folk music is the oldest form of Romanian musical creation, characterised by great vitality; it is the defining source of the cultured musical creation, both religious and lay. Conservation of Romanian folk music has been aided by a large and enduring audience, also by numerous performers who helped propagate and further develop the folk sound. One of them, Gheorghe Zamfir, is famous throughout the world today and helped popularize a traditional Romanian folk instrument, the panpipes.

The religious musical creation, born under the influence of Byzantine music adjusted to the intonations of the local folk music, saw a period of glory between the 15th and 17th centuries, when reputed schools of liturgical music developed within Romanian monasteries. Western influences brought about the introduction of polyphony in religious music in the 18th century, a genre developed by a series of Romanian composers in the 19th and 20th centuries.

== Traditional music ==
Traditional Romanian music reflects a confluence of sounds similar to Central European (Hungarian), East European (Ukrainian) as well as Balkan traditional music. In Romanian folk music, emphasis is on melody rather than percussion, with frequent use of the violin for melody. The melody itself and especially the melodic embellishments are reminiscent of music in the Balkans.
===Banat===
In Banat, the violin is the most common folk instrument, now played alongside imported woodwind instruments; other instruments include the taragot (today often the saxophone plays the taragot role in bands). Efta Botoca is among the most renowned violinists from Banat.

===Bucovina===

Bucovina is a remote province and its traditions include some of the most ancient Romanian instruments, including the țilincă and the cobza. Pipes (&quot;fluieraș&quot; (small pipe) or &quot;fluier mare&quot; (large pipe)) are also played, usually with accompaniment by a cobza (more recently, the accordion). Violins and brass instruments have been imported in modern times.

===Crișana===

Crișana has an ancient tradition of using violins, often in duos. This format is also found in Transylvania but is an older tradition. Petrică Pașca has recently helped popularize the taragot in the region. Also, in Roșia village are well known two local instruments: Hidede, a type of violin with a trumpet, replacing the resonance box and a type of drum called Dobă.

===Northern Dobrogea===

Dobrujan music is characterized by Balkan and Turkish rhythm and melodicism. Dobrogea&#x27;s population is ethnically mixed and the music here has a heavier Turkish, Bulgarian, Tatar and Ukrainian import than in the rest of the country.

===Maramureș and Oaș===

The typical folk ensemble from Maramureș is zongora and violin, often with drums. Maramureș is a remote province (like Bucovina) and its traditions include some of the most ancient Romanian instruments and peasant music. Its music shares many features with Bucovina. Traditional flutes include the țilincă and Fluierul Gemanat (similar to the Bulgarian Dvoyanka). Taragot, saxophones and accordions have more recently been introduced. Traditional singing in this region includes doina.
In Oaș, a violin adapted to be shriller is used, accompanied by the zongora. The singing in this region is also unique, shrill with archaic melodic elements.

===Moldavia (Moldova)===
&quot;See&quot;: Music of Moldova

Violin and țambal are the modern format most common in Moldavian dance music. Prior to the 20th century, however, the violin was usually accompanied by the cobza, which, although very rare, is still in use today. Brass ensembles are now found in the central part of the county. Moldavia is also known for brass bands similar to those in Serbia.

===Transylvania===

Transylvania has been historically and culturally more linked to Central European countries than Southeastern Europe, and its music reflects those influences. The province is tied historically to the smaller western regions of Maramureș, Criana and Banat and they are often referred to collectively as Transylvania.

Violin, kontra and double bass, sometimes with a cimbalom, are the most integral ensemble unit. All these instruments are used to play a wide variety of songs, including numerous kinds of specific wedding songs.

Drum, guitar and violin make up the typical band in Maramureș and virtuoso fiddlers are also popular in the area. In the end of the 1990s, the Maramuzical music festival was organized to draw attention to the indigenous music of the area.

===Wallachia===

Wallachia, consisting of Muntenia and Oltenia, is home to the taraf bands, which are perhaps the best-known expression of Romanian folk culture. Dances associated with tarafs include brâu, geamparale, sârbă and hora. The fiddle leads the music, with the cimbalom and double bass accompanying it. The cobza, once widespread in the region, has been largely replaced by the cimbalom. Lyrics are often about heroes like the haidouks. Taraf de Haïdouks is an especially famous taraf and have achieved international attention since their 1988 debut with the label Ocora. The Haidouks first attained visibility as lăutari, traditional entertainers at weddings and other celebratory occasions.

===Oltenia===

Oltenia&#x27;s folk music and dance are similar to those in Muntenia. Violins and pipes are used, as are țambal and guitar, replacing the cobza as the rhythmic backing for tarafs. The cimpoi (bagpipe) is also popular in this region.

=== Muntenia ===
Muntenia has a diverse set of instrumentation. The flute (&quot;fluier&quot; in Romanian) and violin are the traditional melodic element, but now clarinets and accordions are more often used. Accordionists include the performers Vasile Pandelescu and Ilie Udilă.

===Doina===

The most widespread form of Romanian folk music is the doina. Other styles of folk music include the &quot;bocet&quot; (&quot;lament&quot;) and &quot;cântec bătrânesc&quot; (traditional epic ballads; literally &quot;song of the elders&quot;).

Doina is poetic and often melancholic, sometimes compared to the blues for that reason. Doinas are often played with a slow, free rhythm melody against a fast accompaniment pattern in fixed tempo, giving an overall feeling of rhythmic tension. Melodies are sometimes repeated in differing songs and typically follow a descending pattern.

Regional styles of doina:
*Ca pe luncă - found along the southern Danube
*De codru - &quot;codru&quot; means &quot;forest&quot;
*Hora lungă - means &quot;long dance&quot;, from the region of Maramureș, Transylvania
*Klezmer - originally played by Jewish musicians from Bessarabia and Moldavia
*Oltului - found along the River Olt

Other styles of doina:
*Ca din tulnic - unique type in which the melody imitates a type of bugle called the tulnic
*Ciobanul - shepherd&#x27;s doina
*De dragoste - popular form, usually about love; &quot;dragoste&quot; means &quot;love&quot;.
*De jale - mellow, mournful doina; &quot;jale&quot; means &quot;grief&quot;.
*De leagăn - a lullaby; &quot;leagăn&quot; means &quot;cradle&quot;.
*De pahar - drinking song; &quot;pahar&quot; means &quot;drinking glass&quot;.
*Foaie verde - classical form; literally &quot;green leaves&quot;.

== Classical music ==

Notable Romanian composers of the 19th and 20th centuries include Ciprian Porumbescu, Anton Pann, Eduard Caudella, Mihail Jora, Dinu Lipatti and especially George Enescu. Also famous are the composer and conductor Sergiu Celibidache and Vladimir Cosma.

The Australian composer Julian Cochran wrote works extensively titled &quot;Romanian Dances&quot; with a collection of piano works and six orchestral works, exemplifying affinity amongst classical composers with the Romanian folk music tradition outside of Romania..

And from the second half of the 20th century by the Romanian spectralism school: Ştefan Niculescu, Horațiu Rădulescu, Iancu Dumitrescu, Octavian Nemescu, Ana-Maria Avram and others.

== Jazz ==
Jazz has been imported in Romania as early as the interwar period, thanks to musicians such as Sergiu Malagamba. However, jazz music was banned after World War II, with the arrival of the communist regime. The ban was dropped in 1964.

Promoted but not limited to Cornel Chiriac, jazz musicians and others such as Eugen Ciceu, helped establish the genre in Romania, initially promoted alongside &quot;easy music&quot;. Vocalist Aura Urziceanu has performed in New York City in 1972 and toured extensively under the name Aura Rully.

Although restrained, jazz after 1989 still has cult following, with a number of festivals such as Gărâna International Jazz Festival. Contemporary jazz singers include Johnny Răducanu, Anca Parghel and others. In recent years a few bands have emerged that make use of elements of nu-jazz, trip hop and electronic music: Aievea, Jazzadezz, Norzeatic &amp; Khidja and others.

== Popular music ==

===Rock===
Romanian rock music has a great history with an array of influences. During the 1980s, bands such as Iris, Transsylvania Phoenix, Celelalte Cuvinte, Compact, Holograf or Cargo achieved popularity, with songs about love and friendship. Contemporary popular Romanian rock bands include Vița de Vie, Robin And The Backstabbers, Coma, Alternosfera, Vama, Luna Amară, The Kryptonite Sparks, and Grimus.

The term could be translated literally as &quot;Romanian Easy Music&quot; and, in the most common sense, this music is synonym with &quot;Muzică de stradă&quot; (from French &quot;estrade&quot;, which means &quot;podium&quot;), defining a branch of Pop music developed in Romania after World War II, which appears generally in the form of easy danceable songs, made on arrangements, which are performed by orchestras (and lately pop bands), following a mix of the Soviet and Western pop music influences. This musical form shows many similarities with Western Popular music, as most songs could be defined as a form of Schlager. It supported influences from other similar melodic styles, like Musica leggera italiana (from Italy) and Canción Melódica (from Spain). This Romanian style of music was popularized abroad through the international Golden Stag Festival, held in Brașov, since 1968. The most representative singers of that era are those from the 1980s, 1970s and rarely, the 1960s: Aurelian Andreescu, Elena Cârstea, Corina Chiriac, Mirabela Dauer, Stela Enache, Luigi Ionescu, Horia Moculescu, Margareta Pâslaru, Angela Similea, Dan Spătaru and Aura Urziceanu.

===Romanţe===
Romanţă (plural: romanţe) is a vocal or instrumental musical piece, sung in a poetic and sentimental mood. It appears as an accessible and expressive melody, on the background of piano and guitar orchestral arrangements. It presents similarities to British music style &quot;Easy Music&quot;. The history of Romanian romanţe can be traced back until the Interwar period, when it became famous through the agency of the most popular Romanian singer of that time, Marin Teodorescu, who is better known as Zavaidoc. After World War II, singers like Gică Petrescu integrated in this music orchestral elements, which are specific for Argentinian style, Tango Nuevo.

===Folclor Suburban===

==== Manele ====
Anton Pann had the first few transcriptions of a new style that was present in the suburbs of Bucharest in the 19th century. The new style flourished and grew, being promoted by ordinary musicians playing in suburbs called Mahala. This musical style combined the Balkan (many traditional folkloric genres, including Turkish) and Gypsy styles into a new style called Manele. After the Romanian Revolution in 1990, this genre was booming. A few contemporary bands that promoted the style are:

*Azur (vocalist: Nelu Vlad) - the first band to use electronic beats
*Albatros (vocalist: Iolanda Cristea a.k.a. Naste din Berceni)
*Generic (vocalist: Dan Ciotoi)
*Miracol C (vocalist: Cezar Duţu a.k.a. Cezărică)
*Odeon (vocalist: Costel Geambaşu)
*Real B (vocalist: Cristian Rizescu)
*Tomis Junior (from Galați)

Some modern manele singers, among others, are:
*Guță
*Florin Salam
*Vali Vijelie

==== Etno ====
Etno music is a popular Romanian style, which keeps most accurate the typical ethnic sound of Romanian traditional folk music. It is adapted to the modern sound of music, as employs frequently synthesizers along with the typical traditional instruments. It emerged in the early 1990s as a revival of Romanian traditional folk music and maintained a constant popularity until nowadays. It has the largest audience through the fans of Romanian folk music and it is popularized, along with Romanian folk music, through the medium of Etno TV, a Romanian Television, dedicated mainly to Romanian folk music, especially the modern side of this music.

===Contemporary Romanian folk===
Acoustic Romanian style of music, inspired by American folk music, with sweet lyrics and played almost exclusively with guitar. Generally, it evokes a poetic and melancholic atmosphere. It emerged in the early 1960s, along with the first releases of Phoenix band. It was promoted later, through the medium of the Cenaclul Flacăra, a cultural phenomenon from the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, which was initiated by Adrian Păunescu, a Romanian poet. Many Romanian folk artists gain affirmation through the Cenaclul Flacăra movement: Mircea Vintilă, Vasile Șeicaru, Florian Pittiș, Valeriu Sterian, Nicu Alifantis, Alexandru Zărnescu, Victor Socaciu, Vasile Mardare.

== Rock music ==
From the early years of the communist regime (the 1960s) there was an active rock scene in Romania. Because of their free attitude which was associated with Western culture and the capitalist society, the communist regime censored rock musicians as much as possible. From the beginning they had a &quot;paria&quot; social position. Symbols of the movement such as long hair, jeans, stage attitude were considered decadent. The bands operated under the name of &quot;instrumental-vocal musical ensemble&quot; to avoid the expression &quot;rock&quot;, which was considered to be subversive. Despite this, the rock scene resisted with consequence in a kind of &quot;official underground&quot; before the 1989 Revolution.

Veterans of the scene kept the rock spirit alive under difficult restrictive conditions. The connection with the &quot;news&quot; from the West was made within radio stations such &quot;Free Europe&quot;, which were disallowed. Rock was in these troubled times for its Romanian supporters more than music. It was attitude against the lack of freedom. Names with historical resonance for the Romanian rock movement include Phoenix, Sfinx, Roșu și Negru, Mondial, Sincron, Sideral, Semnal M, Metropol, FFN, Progresiv TM, Pro Musica, Catena, Iris, Compact, Holograf, Timpuri Noi, Krypton, Cargo, Celelalte Cuvinte, Post Scriptum, Florian Pittiș, Cornel Chiriac, Dan Andrei Aldea, Octave Octavian Teodorescu, Sorin Chifiriuc, Nicu Covaci, Valeriu Sterian, Mircea Baniciu, Ovidiu Lipan, Ilie Stepan, Liviu Tudan, Mircea Florian, Dorin Liviu Zaharia, Teo Peter, Florin Ochescu, Cristi Minculescu, Dan Bittman.

The political freedom and the cultural openness gained after the 1989 Revolution marked a new era for rock music in Romania. The scene is now very active, despite rock music not being one of the main acts in Romanian mass media. Rock clubs have a rich list of concerts. There are yearly organized great rock festivals with national and international character.

===Mainstream===
In the 1990s and the early 2000s, with the emergence of independent television and radio stations, the term easy music has been replaced by pop. Mainstream success is shared between early dance-pop bands such as A.S.I.A., Animal X, Blondy, Body &amp; Soul, L.A., 3rei Sud Est or Akcent, pop-rock singers and bands such as Ștefan Bănică Jr., Holograf, Bosquito, Voltaj or VH2, hip-hop outfits such as B.U.G. Mafia, La Familia, Paraziții or Ca$$a Loco, Latino singers (Pepe) and others (the electronic band Șuie Paparude and alternative rock bands such as Vama Veche, Bere Gratis, Sarmalele Reci, OCS, Spitalul de Urgență, Zdob și Zdub or Luna Amară that are still popular, especially underground).

== Romanian popcorn music ==

With the exception of Moldavian-based band O-Zone, Romanian Europop had not achieved considerable echoes outside the borders of the country until 2005, when the band Morandi reached success with songs written in English, Brazilian-Portuguese and other languages. The music style of Morandi, DJ Project, Fly Project and a few others marks the transitional period to the Romanian dance-pop of the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Artists such as Edward Maya, Vika Jigulina, Alexandra Stan, Andreea Bănică, Smiley, Inna, Andreea Bălan, Antonia, David Deejay, Play &amp; Win and Radio Killer brought a new sound has emerged that has managed to achieve commercial success outside Romania and dominate the national TV and radio music charts. This new sound, nicknamed pejoratively by some &quot;popcorn&quot; after the name of one of its characteristic synths, is characterized by &quot;shiny&quot;, danceable melodies, hooks sometimes based on synthesized accordion and simple lyrics written most often in English, accompanied by videos frequently featuring young women. &quot;Popcorn&quot; has been criticized by some as superficial (sometimes being even compared to Manele), overly commercial, repetitive and easily grating, as a large number of producers and performers have adopted this sound in a short period of time. However, since Romanian spectralism is virtually unknown outside the avant-garde music community, &quot;popcorn&quot; may be considered the first movement in the history of Romanian history to gain momentum.

== House music ==
An important influence on Romanian dance-pop was house music, which gained so much following in clubs that, thanks to radio stations such as Pro FM, has attained mainstream status. Minimal house in the vein of Ricardo Villalobos has and is being produced by DJs such as Petre Inspirescu, but vocal-based house continues to have more success. As of recently, dubstep has emerged alongside house music, although currently still underground.

===Underground music===
Pre-1989 underground bands include the new-wave band Rodion G.A. alongside older rock bands such as Celelalte Cuvinte and Semnal M. First electronic music attempts belong to composer Adrian Enescu.

First represented by bands such as Vorbire Directă and R.A.C.L.A., hip-hop music has achieved quickly mainstream success with bands such as B.U.G. Mafia, La Familia and Paraziții, in spite of them being criticized for delivering explicit language and themes. The scene is currently split between mainstream rappers (Puya, Guess Who) and underground rappers (Vexxatu Vexx, CTC., Haarp Cord). Labels dedicated to hip-hop include Hades Records, 20 CM Records and Facem Records (the first independent hip-hop label from Romania).

Rock scene is currently split between metal bands (such as Negură Bunget and Trooper), progressive and indie rock outfits (byron, Kumm, Robin and the Backstabbers). There are also other niches such as punk rock (E.M.I.L. Haos, Terror Art) or post-rock (Valerinne).

Underground electronic music scene has been until 2010 somewhat unified by the existence of the Timișoara-based festival TMBase, reuniting DJs and producers from genres such as drum and bass, breakbeat, dub techno, electronic rock etc. A result of TMBase collaborations is the IDM outfit Makunouchi Bento, who have attracted some attention with their Bandcamp-released material. Also notable is the label La Strada Music, which has been home to names such as Silent Strike (who has gained acclaim on the Internet and some radio stations with the single &quot;Astenie&quot; featuring Ada Milea), Yvat (a prolific IDM producer of Belgian origin, based in Bucharest), Electric Brother, nu-jazz outfit Aievea and others.

Trip hop and post-rock have influenced a few bands such as Margento, but dream pop, shoegaze and other niche genres are poorly represented. Freak folk is partially known due to the success of singer-songwriter Ada Milea, but is practiced by only a few other bands such as Nu &amp; Apa Neagră. The producer Minus has attempted to introduce bitpop and, more recently, chillwave.

Dubstep DJs have started to emerge, though with the genre has also been associated the band R.O.A., who have achieved some mainstream success thanks to the leader Junkyard, formerly vocalist in Șuie Paparude.

<text>Ceratophyllum is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants commonly found in ponds, marshes, and quiet streams in tropical and in temperate regions. It is the only extant genus in the family Ceratophyllaceae, itself the only extant family in the order Ceratophyllales. They are usually called coontails or hornworts, although hornwort is also used for unrelated plants of the division Anthocerotophyta.

==Description==
&quot;Ceratophyllum&quot; grows completely submerged, usually, though not always, floating on the surface of the water. The plant stems can reach 1–3 m in length. At intervals along nodes of the stem they produce rings of bright green leaves, which are narrow and often much-branched. The forked leaves are brittle and stiff to the touch in some species, softer in others. Roots are completely absent and are missing even in the embryonic stage, but sometimes they develop modified leaves with a rootlike appearance, which anchor the plant to the bottom. Stomata are not present on any species. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the male and female flowers on the same plant. In ponds it forms thick buds (turions) in the autumn, which sink to the bottom and give the impression that the plant has been killed by the frost; but come spring, these will grow back into the long stems, slowly filling up the pond.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ceratophyllum&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 with &quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot; as the type species. &quot;Ceratophyllum&quot; is considered distinctive enough to warrant its own family, Ceratophyllaceae, but was considered a relative of Nymphaeaceae and included in Nymphaeales in the Cronquist system. Recent research has shown that it is not closely related to Nymphaeaceae or any other extant plant family. Some early molecular phylogenies suggested it was the sister group to all other angiosperms, but more recent research suggests that it is the sister group to the eudicots. This notion was supported upon sequencing of the &quot;C. demersum&quot; genome in 2020. The APG IV system placed the family in its own order, the Ceratophyllales, and gives the following cladogram.

===Species===
The subgeneric division of the genus &quot;Ceratophyllum&quot; into its appropriately recognized species, subspecies, and varieties is not settled. More than 30 species have been described and published. A narrow interpretation of this work rejects over 23 of these taxa as variants, accepting only 7 species. This narrow interpretation lumps to the point of failing to give these potential species the taxonomic importance of even being named on a subspecific or varietal level. The genus as narrowly defined in this manner contains the following seven species:

* &quot;Ceratophyllum australe&quot; 
* &quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot; (rigid/common hornwort) – cosmopolitan
* &quot;Ceratophyllum echinatum&quot; (spiny hornwort) – North America
* &quot;Ceratophyllum muricatum&quot; (prickly hornwort) – Near-cosmopolitan
* &quot;Ceratophyllum platyacanthum&quot; – Europe and Asia
* &quot;Ceratophyllum submersum&quot; (soft/tropical hornwort) – Europe, Middle-East, Central Asia, northern and central Africa, Florida, and Dominican Republic
* &quot;Ceratophyllum tanaiticum&quot; 

===Phylogeny===

A 2018 phylogenetic analysis of the above species gives the below cladogram. It finds support for 4 species being monophyletic, while 3 others are paraphyletic. It found &quot;C. australe&quot; to be a divergent lineage of &quot;C. tanaiticum&quot;, rendering &quot;C. tanaiticum&quot; paraphyletic. Nonetheless, it still regards &quot;C. australe&quot; as a separate species due to significant morphological differences and its geographic isolation from the rest of &quot;C. tanaiticum&quot;. &quot;C. demersum&quot; and &quot;C. platyacanthum&quot; were recovered as paraphyletic with respect to each other, and as such they could possibly be considered one species, although their morphologies and ecologies are distinct.

<doc id="247134" wikidata="Q5177042" url="?curid=247134" title="Counterstereotype">
<text>A counterstereotype is an idea or object that goes against a stereotype -- a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group and that represents an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or uncritical judgment.

== Process ==

=== Background ===
Minority groups within society are often portrayed negatively within popular media. Through psychological processes such as priming, this reinforces consumers’ negative stereotypes toward those groups. Bombarding consumers with these stereotypes causes implicit attitudes - which occurs in the absence of conscious thought - to be negative towards those groups. This has a wide range of consequences, with the most profound effects being seen in exposure to the “negative” group in ambiguous situations. An example of this can be seen with the over-portrayal of African-Americans as criminals in American media: the psychological literature shows that through media reinforcement of a criminal stereotype, consumers of this content evaluate African-Americans as more dangerous than other groups even in ambiguous situations. This demonstrates how media depiction of stereotypes can lead directly to prejudice. This is consequential because it can affect not only inter-group interactions, but the self-identity of the “negative group” (see: Self-fulfilling prophecy). Psychological research has shown that the stereotype associated simply with one’s name can cause changes in behavior and cognition. 

Counter-stereotypes work by presenting media consumers with a member of a “negative” group who does not act stereotypically. This challenges consumers’ existing attitudes towards that group, and has been shown to reduce existing prejudices toward them. Exposing consumers to counter-stereotypes may also lead to increased support for policy options aimed at addressing racial disparities, such as affirmative action. 

=== Exemplar Models ===
Exemplar-based explanations of counter-stereotyping have gained much support from the psychological literature. Prototypes can best be described as ideas of what a category is, formed by averaging all instances of that category that an individual has come into contact with. Exemplars are specific representations of that “averaged” category, and can serve to change the prototype. By presenting consumers with prototypes not consistent with their existing representation of that group, counter stereotypes can change implicit attitudes toward the target group. The recency and frequency of exposure to the exemplar mediate how stereotypes change over time, with those that are chronically accessible being the most effective of all.

=== Categorization-Processing-Adaptation-Generalization Model ===
The Categorization Processing Adaptation Generalization model builds upon previous cognitive research as to how diversity experiences, or in essence counterstereotypical experiences can change the way people think. When encountering counter stereotypical events, if a perceiver is motivated to engage in elaborative processing involving stereotype suppression and generative thought, that with multiple experiences resulting in elaborative processing, the perceiver will develop generalized cognitive flexibility. This would mean the use of elaborative thought over heuristics based thinking, and weakens reliance on quick mental representations such as stereotypes.

== Limitations ==

=== Selection Bias ===
One major limitation of the Counterstereotype effect is that it may not reach the audience which would benefit most from exposure because that audience chooses not to view content with minority characters. In the last few decades, the ability for audiences to be selective with their choice for media consumption has increased rapidly and led to the rise of the echo chamber. Individuals who hold an explicit negative stereotype of a certain group have the option to avoid all content which contains that group, preventing exposure to the counter-stereotype altogether. Research into this phenomenon also suggests that negative stereotypes don’t have to be held explicitly to affect media viewing habits: implicit attitudes, which are not held consciously, affect the willingness of individuals to consume content depicting certain groups. In short, the counter-stereotype effect is limited not by the process in which it occurs, but by its limited ability to reach individuals who already hold negative attitudes towards the target group.

=== Backlash Effects ===
Not to be confused with the boomerang effect which refers to unintended psychosocial consequences resulting from persuasion, nor backlash effects in sociology, the backlash effect is similar in principle, having to do with psychosocial consequences resulting from perception of being counter stereotypical. Most cited definition of the backlash effect by Rudman in 1998 is where violation of stereotypes may potentially lead to social or economic consequences. Although these counterstereotypical people may be perceived as unique, the backlash effect and its consequences often limit their success, and can lead to a reinforcement of stereotypes.

A 2004 study by Rudman and Fairchild modeled the backlash effect and stereotype maintenance stemming from perceivers and actors, their justification or fear of backlash, and the importance in the maintenance of self-esteem. From the perceivers view, if it is justified by a threat to their self-esteem, backlash towards counter stereotypical people may restore their sense of worth, however this only further reinforces societal stereotypes. The backlash effect can also lead counter stereotypical individuals to fear the potential consequences and thus be more likely to hide their counter stereotypical behavior, maintaining their self-esteem. This also leads to the maintenance of cultural stereotypes.

==== Examples of backlash effects ====

* Women being underrepresented in high level roles in some industries resulting from withholding promotions to women who display counter stereotypical behaviour, or women not wanting to exhibit counter stereotypical behaviour as a fear of backlash. 
* The marvel character Miles Morales whom is a version of Spiderman that is often the white Peter Parker as had several waves of backlash directed at the character and creators 
* Minority actors in Hollywood despite showing great talent, being typecast in cheap caricature roles, and backlash towards their success in the industry as a whole 

==Notable examples==
*An example of a counter-stereotype is the Fifteenth Doctor, a character in the British TV series &quot;Dr. Who&quot;. Previously played exclusively by white actors, the inclusion of a black actor for this role served to combat existing stereotypes in British society.
*In the film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, the main character displays exceptional intellectual abilities and wins a large monetary prize. This challenges the stereotype that those living in poverty are not intelligent.
*American popular literature in the 19th century contained stereotypical images of black people as grotesque and servile. In protest, a counter-stereotype arose which showed black people as graceful and wise.
*In the United States during the 1970s, in response to feminist criticism, advertising agencies chose to display counter-stereotypical images of women as sexually assertive and intellectual.
*In the film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, the main character, Elle Woods, acts as a counter-stereotype displaying how a blonde, conventionally attractive and fashion-loving woman is also intelligent and successful at attending law school.

<text>The rich and varied music of Sudan has traditional, rural, northeastern African roots and also shows Arabic, Western or other African influences, especially on the popular urban music from the early 20th century onwards. Since the establishment of big cities like Khartoum as melting pots for people of diverse backgrounds, their cultural heritage and tastes have shaped numerous forms of modern popular music. In the globalized world of today, the creation and consumption of music through satellite TV or on the Internet is a driving force for cultural change in Sudan, popular with local audiences as well as with Sudanese living abroad.

Even after the secession of South Sudan in 2011, the Sudan of today is very diverse, with five hundred plus ethnic groups spread across the territory of what is the third largest country in Africa. The cultures of its ethnic and social groups have been marked by a complex cultural legacy, going back to the spread of Islam, the regional history of the slave trade and by indigenous African and Arab cultural heritage. Though some of the ethnic groups still maintain their own African language, most Sudanese today use the distinct Sudanese version of Arabic.

Due to its geographic location in North Africa, where African, Arabic, Christian and Islamic cultures have shaped people&#x27;s identities, and bordering the Sahel region, Sudan has been a cultural crossroads between North, East and West Africa, as well as the Arabian Peninsula, for hundreds of years. Thus, it has a rich and very diverse musical culture, ranging from traditional folk music to Sudanese popular urban music of the 20th century and up to the internationally influenced African popular music of today.

Despite religious and cultural objections towards music and dance in public life, musical traditions have always enjoyed great popularity with most Sudanese. Apart from singing in Standard Arabic, the majority of Sudanese singers express their lyrics in Sudanese Arabic, thereby touching the feelings of their national audience as well as the growing number of Sudanese living abroad, notably in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. Even during times of wide-ranging restrictions of public life imposed by the government, public concerts or the celebration of weddings and other social events with music and dance have always been part of cultural life in Sudan.

== Folk music and other traditional musical forms ==

=== Rural traditional music and dance ===
As in other neighboring African regions, the traditional musical styles of Sudan are ancient, rich and diverse, with different regions and ethnic groups having many distinct musical traditions. Music in Africa has always been very important as an integral part of religious and social life of communities. Performances of songs, dance and instrumental music are used in rituals and social ceremonies like weddings, circumcision rites or to accompany the long camel treks of the Bedouins. In these performances, music always has been a social event, marked by the combination of performers, lyrics, music and the participation of the community, like dancing or other types of sharing a musical event. Traditional music and its performance have been handed down from generation to generation by accomplished musicians to younger generations and was not written down, except in recent times by formally trained musicians or ethnomusicologists.

In contrast to traditional Arabic music, most Sudanese music styles are pentatonic, and the simultaneous beats of percussion or singing in polyrhythms are further prominent characteristics of Sudanese music. The music of Sudan also has a strong tradition of lyrical expression that uses oblique metaphors, speaks about love, the history of a tribe or the beauty of the country. In his essay Sudanese Singing 1908–1958, author El Sirr A. Gadour translated an example for the lyrics of a love song from the beginning of the 20th century as follows:


One of the most typical East African instruments, called &quot;tanbūra&quot; or &quot;kissar&quot; in Nubian music, was traditionally played by the singers as the usual accompaniment for such songs, but this Sudanese lyre has largely been replaced in the 20th century by the Arabic oud. Drums, hand clapping and dancing are other important elements of traditional musical performances, as well as the use of other African instruments, like traditional xylophones, flutes or trumpets. One example for this are the elaborate wooden gourd trumpets, called al Waza, played by the Berta people of the Blue Nile state.

&quot;The History of the World in 100 Objects&quot; features a large wooden slit drum in the shape of a buffalo from southern Sudan, probably made in the 19th century for traditional performances in larger ensembles or to summon warriors, that is now held in the British Museum in London. A copper kettle drum that was reputedly used by Mahdist forces in the Battle of Omdurman (1898) is in the collection of the National Army Museum in London.

=== The role of women in traditional music ===
In many ethnic groups, distinguished women play an important role in the social celebration of a tribe&#x27;s virtues and history. In her report about women as singers in Darfur, the ethnomusicologist Roxane Connick Carlisle recounts her fieldwork during the 1960s in three ethnic groups. She describes the common traits of these bards from the Zaghawa ethnic group like this:

Another traditional form of women&#x27;s role in oral poetry are the songs of praise or ridicule of singers in western Sudan, called &quot;Hakamat&quot;. These are women of high social standing, respected for their eloquence, intuition and decisiveness, who may both incite or vilify the men of their tribe, when engaged in feuds with other tribes. The social impact of these &quot;Hakamat&quot; can be so strong, that they have been invited by peacebuilding initiatives in Darfur to exert their influence for conflict resolution or contemporary social issues, like environmental protection.

Sudanese women are also known both at home and in the wider region for their role as singers and musicians playing the dalooka drum in &quot;aghani al-banat&quot; (transl.: Girls&#x27; songs) as well as for their spiritual musical performances called zār, believed to be able to exorcise evil spirits from possessed individuals.

=== Zikr rituals as religious forms of recitation and performance ===
The numerous brotherhoods of Sufi dervishes in Sudan are religious, mystical groups that use prayers, music and ritual dance to achieve an altered state of consciousness in an Islamic tradition called &quot;zikr&quot; (remembrance). These ritualized &quot;zikr&quot; ceremonies are, however, not considered by the faithful as musical performances, but as a form of prayer. Each order or lineage within an order has one or more forms for &quot;zikr&quot;, the liturgy of which may include recitation, instrumental accompaniment by drums, dance, costumes, incense, and is sometimes leading to ecstasy and trance. &quot;Zikr&quot; rituals are most often celebrated on late Friday afternoons, like the one at the tomb of Sheikh Hamed el-Nil in Omdurman.&quot;&quot;

== Brass bands and the origins of modern Sudanese music ==
From the early 1920s onwards, radio, records, film and later television have contributed to the development of Sudanese popular music by introducing new instruments and styles. Already during the Turkish-Egyptian rule and later during the Anglo-Egyptian condominium until independence, first Egyptian, and then British military bands left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western brass instruments. According to social historian Ahmad Sikainga, &quot;Sudanese members of military bands can be regarded as the first professional musicians, taking the lead in the process of modernization and indigenisation.&quot; Today still, such marching bands represent a characteristic element in Sudan, playing the National Anthem on Independence Day and other official celebrations.

== Development of modern Sudanese music ==

=== The 1920s: hageeba, the origin of modern popular music in Sudan ===
The strongest stylistic influence in the development of modern popular Sudanese music has become known as &quot;hageeba&quot; music (pronounced &quot;hagee-ba&quot; and meaning &quot;briefcase&quot;). The name &quot;hageeba&quot;, however, was only applied much later to popular songs from the 1920s, when radio presenter Ahmed Mohamed Saleh talked about old records, collected in his briefcase for his show &quot;hageebat al-fann&quot; (a&quot;rtistic&quot; &quot;briefcase&quot;), that he presented on Radio Omdurman during the 1940s.

In terms of the history of music of Sudan, the label &quot;hageeba&quot; applies to an important change in the development of modern music: A new urban style of singing and lyrics was evolving, moving away from tribal folk songs and the melodies of religious, devotional singing. This style was inaugurated by the singer Muhamad Wad El Faki, as well as others like Muhamad Ahmed Sarour, who were later inspired by Wad El Faki. These songs were initially inspired by the vocal tradition of Islamic praise chanting for the prophet Muhammad, known as &quot;madeeh&quot;. Gradually, melodies known from &quot;madeeh&quot; were used by singers like Wad El Faki and others to accompany new, non-religious lyrics. During his childhood years at a religious school, called &quot;khalwa&quot; in Sudan, Wad El Faki had learned recitation in classical Arabic, voice control and correct pronunciation. According to El Sirr A. Gadour, Wad El Faki &quot;did not belong to any of the main ethnic communities in Omdurman. This freed him from a narrow identity and made him a &#x27;general&#x27; singer, crossing the tribal barrier to broader national affiliation.&quot;

&quot;Hageeba&quot; started as essentially vocal music, sung by a lead singer and a chorus, with percussion coming from the tambourine-like &quot;tar&quot; frame drum. It was performed at weddings and other social occasions and soon became popular. – During the 1930s, the first commercial 78 rpm gramophone records of Sudanese musicians such as Muhamad Ahmed Sarour and Khalil Farah were recorded in Cairo and marketed from Omdurman, from where this new music spread to listeners in greater Khartoum and other urban centres.

=== 1930s – 1950s: rise of popular music through records, radio and music halls ===
Since the mid-1920s, modern instruments such as pianos, accordions and violins, as well as records and record players were imported. In the 1930s, a number of music companies opened in Sudan, among them the Gordon Memorial College musical company. One of its members, called Mohamed Adam Adham, composed the piece &quot;Adhamiya,&quot; one of the earliest formal Sudanese compositions, that is still often played.

The pioneers of this era were often singer-songwriters, including the prolific Abdallah Abdel Karim, called Karouma, the innovative Ibrahim al-Abadi and Khalil Farah, a poet and singer, who wrote the lyrics and music for the patriotic song &quot;Azza fi Hawak&quot; and was active in the Sudanese national movement. Al-Abadi was known for an unorthodox style of fusing traditional wedding poetry with music. Further, a specific style of rhythmic choral singing by Sudanese women evolved out of praise singing during the 1930s, called &quot;Tum Tum&quot;. Originating from Kosti on the White Nile, the lyrics of &quot;tum tum&quot; were romantic, but sometimes also talking about the difficulties of female life. The music was danceable and became quickly popular in urban centres.

The 1940s saw an influx of new names due to the rise of music programmes at Radio Omdurman. Notable performers included Ismail Abdul Mu&#x27;ain, Hassan Attia and Ahmed al Mustafa. Another singer-songwriter was Ibrahim al Kashif, who was called the &quot;Father of modern singing&quot;. Al Kashif sang in the style of Mohamed Ahmed Sarour, a pioneer of &quot;hageeba&quot;, and relied on what Abdel Karim Karouma had started, renewing popular singing styles. For live performances, there were also two dance halls in Khartoum, St James&#x27; and the Gordon Music Hall.

Subsequently, Sudanese popular music evolved into what is generally referred to as &quot;post-hageeba&quot;, a style dominating in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. This period was marked by the introduction of instruments from both East and West, such as the violin, accordion, oud, tabla or bongo drums. Further, a big band style with a string section and brass instruments came into existence. &quot;Post-hageeba&quot; music, mixed with Egyptian and Western elements has also been called &quot;al-aghani al-hadith&quot; (modern songs).

=== 1960s – 1980s: the Golden Age of popular music in Sudan ===
In the 1960s, American pop stars became well known, which had a profound effect on Sudanese musicians like Osman Alamu and Ibrahim Awad, the latter becoming the first Sudanese musician to dance on stage. Under these influences, Sudanese popular music saw a further Westernisation and the introduction of electric guitars and brass instruments. Guitar music also came from the South of the country, and was played like the Congolese guitar styles. Congolese music like soukous, as well as Cuban Rumba, exerted a profound influence on Sudanese popular music.

Starting his career in the late 1950s, the Nubian singer, songwriter and instrumentalist Mohammed Wardi became one of Sudan&#x27;s first superstars. Despite his exile following the military coup in 1989, his popularity in Sudan and beyond kept rising until his return in 2002 and up to his death in 2012.

Singer-songwriter Sayed Khalifa was one of the first Sudanese musicians trained in formal music theory, which he acquired at the Arab Music Institute in Cairo during the early 1950s. Like other Sudanese singers, he performed in both Standard Arabic as well as in the Sudanese form of Arabic, thus appealing both to the educated elite and to the common people. Khalifa is known for his songs &quot;Ya Watani (My Homeland)&quot; and &quot;Izzayakum Keifinnakum (How are you?)&quot;.

Performing from the late 1970s onward, a new popular singer was Mostafa Sid Ahmed. A teacher as a young man, he entered the College of Fine Arts and Music in Khartoum and composed his music to the lyrics of many well-known Sudanese poets like Azhari Mohamed Ali and Mahjoub Sharif, often expressing the longing for freedom and the struggle of the Sudanese people against dictatorship.

An important development in modern Sudanese music was introduced by the group &quot;Sharhabil and his band&quot; – formed by a group of friends from Omdurman – namely Sharhabil Ahmed and his fellow musicians Ali Nur Elgalil, Farghali Rahman, Kamal Hussain, Mahaddi Ali, Hassan Sirougy and Ahmed Dawood. Sharhabil&#x27;s wife and member of the band, Zakia Abdul Gassim Abu Bakr, was the first female guitarist in Sudan. They introduced modern rhythms relating to Western pop and soul music, using electric guitars, double bass, and jazz-like brass instruments, with an emphasis on the rhythm section. Their lyrics were also poetic and became very popular. Up to the late 2010s, Sharhabil&#x27;s band has been one of the leading names in Sudanese music, performing both at home as well as internationally. Another popular group of the late 1970s were called The Scorpions and Saif Abu Bakr.

Since the 1940s, women had slowly become socially acceptable on the musical scene: Well-known singers were Um el Hassan el Shaygiya and most of all, Aisha al Falatiya, who as early as 1943 was the first woman to sing on Sudanese radio. Another outstanding female singer and political activist of the years before and after Sudan&#x27;s independence in 1956 was Hawa Al-Tagtaga, who left a long lasting influence for the &quot;moral and cultural legitimacy she bestowed on younger generations of Sudanese women singers who follow her tradition&quot;, as critic Magdy El Gizouli put it.

During the 1970s, a wave of new women&#x27;s groups became prominent on stage and the radio. Most famous among these was a band composed of three sisters called Al Balabil (transl.: The Nightingales). They formed as a band in 1971, appeared on many live and TV shows and became very popular across East Africa. The 1980s saw the rise of Hanan Bulu Bulu, a singer whose performances were deemed by some as sensual and provocative. She was repeatedly detained by the authorities and even beaten up by hardliners.

International popular genres like Western dance music, rock or pop music and African-American music have had a profound effect on modern Sudanese music. As in other African countries, one of these influences were the military brass bands. Playing in such bands attracted many young military recruits, who later carried their newly learned music style and instruments over to popular music. The result was a kind of dance music, referred to as (Sudanese) jazz, which was not related to the American style of jazz, but similar to other modern dance music styles throughout East Africa. Prominent band leaders in this era include Abdel Gadir Salim and Abdel Aziz El Mubarak, both of whom have achieved international fame and distribution of their albums.

In retrospect, the 1960s up to the 80s were called &#x27;The Golden Age of Sudanese popular music&#x27;. This period was documented by re-issued albums in 2018, when researchers from the US and Germany were looking for still existing recordings from that era. Out of this research, several digitised albums of popular music from Sudan were digitally remastered. These included stars like Abdel Aziz El Mubarak, Kamal Tarbas, Khojali Osman, Abu Obeida Hassan, Kamal Keila, Sharhabil Ahmed, Hanan Bulu Bulu, Samira Dunia and, most famously, Mohammed Wardi and have become available on the international market.

A special place among musicians from Sudan can be granted to composer, musician and music director Ali Osman, who settled in Cairo in 1978 and became one of the important figures in Egypt for classical and contemporary music in the European tradition. After his beginnings in Sudan as a self-taught rock musician, he later turned to classical music and composed symphonic works of Sudanese or Egyptian inspiration that have been performed internationally.

=== 1990s – 2000s: restrictions through sharia law and the decline of popular music ===
After a military coup in 1989, the imposition of &quot;sharia&quot; law by an Islamist government brought about the closing of music halls and outdoor concerts, as well as many other restrictions for musicians and their audiences. Many of the country&#x27;s most prominent musicians or writers were barred from public life, and in some cases even imprisoned. Others, like Mohammed al Amin, whose personal style of playing the oud influenced other musicians, and Mohammed Wardi, took exile in Cairo or other places. Traditional music suffered too, with East African &quot;zār&quot; ceremonies, where women conjure and exorcise evil spirits through music and dance, interrupted and deemed as &#x27;pagan&#x27;. In this context of ceremonies for women, the singer Setona, born in Kordofan and raised in Khartoum, before she emigrated to Cairo in 1989, published two albums, called &quot;Tariq Sudan&quot; and &quot;Queen of Hena&quot;, with some of her songs related to henna ceremonies. Another singer and composer of popular songs, who appeared on Sudan&#x27;s musical scene in the 1990s, is Nada Al-Qalaa. Through her songs, video clips and media interviews, Al-Qalaa has presented conservative views on social life and gender roles. This and the support by wealthy patrons in Sudan and Nigeria has caused criticism, accusing her of being close to the military government. On the other hand, her music and public appearance has earned her a wide following for more than twenty years. The popular singer Abu Araki al-Bakheit was banned from performing his political songs, but eventually managed to continue performing in defiance of the authorities and had a comeback in 2019 during the Sudanese revolution. Others, like the southern Sudanese singer Yousif Fataki had all their tapes erased by Radio Omdurman. Other performers that continued to be popular during this time include Abdel Karim al Kabli or Mahmoud Abdulaziz, both with a notably long and diverse history of performance and recordings, as well as Mohammed al Amin and Mohammed Wardi. Occasionally accompanying Wardi and poetry recitals, blind oud player Awad Ahmoudi has been known for his distinct style of playing the oud in his typical style and pentatonic scales.

Another musician, who started his career in the late 1980s and also suffered from harassment by the military government, is Omer Ihsas. A native of southern Darfur, he and his band have played and spread their message of peace and reconciliation both in camps for internally displaced people in Darfur, as well as in Khartoum and on international stages.

Foreign musicians, who became popular in Sudan, included reggae superstar Bob Marley and American pop singer Michael Jackson, while the funk of James Brown inspired Sudanese performers such as Kamal Keila. The spread of international pop music through radio, TV, cassette tapes and digital recordings also prompted a growing number of Sudanese musicians to sing in English, connecting their music with the outside world. – Even though the government of the time discouraged music, dance and theatre, the College of Music and Drama of Sudan University of Science and Technology in Khartoum, in existence since 1969, continued to offer courses and degrees, thus giving young people a chance to study music or theatre.

=== 2000s – present ===

====Protest songs, reggae, hip hop and rap====
Songs with political messages have been popular in Sudan since at least the 1960s. Political lyrics by poets and musicians such as Mohammed Wardi&#x27;s &quot;Green October&quot; or Mohammed Al-Amin&#x27;s song &quot;October 21st&quot; became famous in the context of the October 1964 Revolution. Ever since the third Sudanese Revolution started in December 2018, musicians, poets and visual artists have been playing an important part in the mainly youth driven movement. Referring to its impact at the sit-in outside the Sudanese army headquarters on April 25, 2019, &quot;Dum&quot; (trans. blood), a song by Sudanese-American rap musician Ayman Mao was called the &quot;Anthem of Sudan&#x27;s Revolution&quot;. According to Sudanese blogger Ola Diab, &quot;young urban musicians have used their musical talents and creativity to express the revolt of protesters against President Al Bashir and his regime.&quot;

As in other countries, reggae, rap or hip hop music combines local talents and international, young audiences, both in live performances as well as on the internet. In 2018, Sudanese journalist Ola Diab published a list of contemporary music videos by upcoming artists, both from Sudan and the Sudanese diaspora in the US, Europe or the Middle East. One of them is the Sudanese–American rapper Ramey Dawoud and another the Sudanese–Italian singer and songwriter Amira Kheir.

International artists, such as the popular Australian hip hop musician Bangs, who was born in Juba, South Sudan, see these genres as an avenue for peace, tolerance, and community for millions of African youth, who are powerful in numbers but politically marginalised. As the example of South Sudanese singer Emmanuel Jal shows, the lyrics have the ability to reach even child soldiers to imagine a different lifestyle. Jimmie Briggs, the author of the book &quot;Innocence Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War&quot; (2005) concurred: &quot;A music group is not an army, but it can get powerful social messages out before trouble starts.&quot; US-based Sudanese rapper Nadine El Roubi has gained popularity online, while also raising funds for Sudan during the Sudanese civil war (2023–present).

==== Urban contemporary music of the 21st century ====
Since producing music in recording studios, using modern instruments and digital media, has become available in Sudan, growing numbers of people are listening to private (online) radio stations like Capital Radio 91.6 FM or are watching music videos. As in other countries with restrictions of freedom of expression, the use of smartphones offers especially young, urban and educated people, and most importantly, Sudanese women, a relatively safe space for exchange with their friends or distant relatives, as well as access to many sources of entertainment, learning or general information.

Until the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19, permission for public concerts had to be obtained by the Ministry of Culture as well as by the police, and after 11 pm, all public events had to end. As the mostly young audiences did not have enough money to pay for tickets, most concerts, for example in the National Theatre in Omdurman, the garden of the National Museum of Sudan or the Green Yard sports arena in Khartoum, were offered free of charge. Musical performances were also organized in the premises of the French, German or British Cultural centres, giving young artists a chance to perform in a sheltered environment. Workshops with visiting artists and festivals like the Karmakol International Festival or the Sama Music Festival have given opportunities to young Sudanese musicians to improve their skills and experience.

Famous local artists of this era are the musicians of Igd al-Jalad, a group known for its critical expression for many years, the popular singer Nancy Ajaj and the pop group Aswat Almadina, all of them singing more or less obvious lyrics about their love of the country, which they claim as their heritage and future, despite the ruling government of the time. Another popular musician is Mazin Hamid, who became known as producer of music videos and through his live performances as singer, guitarist and composer. Islam Elbeiti is a young Sudanese female bass player, radio presenter, and social change activist. As members of the important group of the Sudanese diaspora, Alsarah &amp; The Nubatones, Sinkane or the rapper Oddisee are examples for musicians with a Sudanese background living in the US.

Following their musical studies at Ahfad University for Women in Omdurman, as well as by participating in workshops and concerts at the German cultural institute in Khartoum, a band of young women called Salute yal Bannot (Respect for the girls) became well known in 2017. Their song &quot;African Girl&quot; has scored more than 130,000 views on YouTube alone and earned them an invitation to the popular music show Arabs Got Talent in Beirut. After leaving this band, one of their lead singers, composer and keyboard player Hiba Elgizouli has been pursuing her own career as a singer-songwriter and produced her own music videos.

A new trend in Sudanese urban music since the 2010s is called &quot;Zanig&quot; and has become popular as a form of underground music, spread through bootleg recordings, live shows and sound systems on public transport. It was described in the following way by cultural journalist and fellow of the Rift Valley Institute, Magdi el Gizouli:This bootleg musical genre, pioneered by the King Ayman al-Rubo, is a fusion of West African beats and Egyptian mahrajanat style, with frequent accelerations and deceleration and techno-style repetition. Zanig queens sing about &quot;antibaby pills&quot; and the agency of &quot;MILFs&quot; and introduce themselves with maxims like: &quot;If you follow the sugar mummies you&#x27;ll end up driving six cars, and if you follow the little buds you&#x27;ll waste your money in restaurants&quot;.In 2020, a local branch of the Arabic Oud House (&quot;Bayt al-Ud al-Arabi&quot;) was opened in Khartoum, dedicated to teaching the Arabic musical instruments oud and qanun as well as classical Arabic musical tradition, and as a centre for events and exchange. The Arabic Oud House is a network of musical centres, started by renowned Iraqi oud player and composer Naseer Shamma, with headquarters in Cairo and branches in Alexandria, Egypt, as well as in Constantine, Algeria and Abu Dhabi, UAE.

In 2022, a new band from Port Sudan called Noori &amp; his Dorpa Band published music videos and an album for Ostinato records. Their music is inspired by traditional and modern music of the Beja people, using a traditional tanbura (lyre) combined with an electric guitar as well as saxophone, electric guitars and a rhythm section.

<text>Sharp Zaurus is a series of personal digital assistants (PDAs) made by Sharp Corporation. The Zaurus was the most popular PDA during the 1990s in Japan and was based on a proprietary operating system. The first Sharp PDA to use the Linux operating system was the SL-5000D, running the Qtopia-based Embedix Plus. The Linux Documentation Project considers the Zaurus series to be &quot;true Linux PDAs&quot; because their manufacturers install Linux-based operating systems on them by default. The name derives from the common suffix applied to the names of dinosaurs.

== History ==

In September 1993, Sharp introduced the PI-3000, the first in the Zaurus line of PDAs, as a follow-on to Sharp&#x27;s earlier Wizard line of PDAs (the Wizard also influenced Apple&#x27;s Newton). Featuring a black and white LCD screen, handwriting recognition, and optical communication capabilities among its features, the Zaurus soon became one of Sharp&#x27;s best selling products.

The PI-4000, released in 1994, expanded the Zaurus&#x27; features with a built-in modem and facsimile functions. This was succeeded in 1995 by the PI-5000, which had e-mail and mobile phone interfaces, as well as PC linking capability. The Zaurus K-PDA was the first Zaurus to have a built-in keyboard in addition to handwriting recognition; the PI-6000 and PI-7000 brought in additional improvements.

In 1996 Sharp introduced the Sharp Zaurus ZR-5800. It used the same compact design, ports and pointing device as the previous Zaurus models. The changes were mostly in the ROM. It came with 2 MB RAM and a backlit 320x240 LCD display.

During this time, Sharp was making significant advances in color LCD technology. In May 1996, the first color Zaurus was released; the MI-10 and MI-10DC were equipped with a five-inch (12.7 cm) color thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD screen. This model had the ability to connect to the internet, and had a built-in camera and audio recorder. Later that year, Sharp developed a forty-inch (100 cm) TFT LCD screen, the world&#x27;s largest at the time. In December, the MI-10/10DC Zaurus was chosen as the year&#x27;s best product by Information Display Magazine in the United States.

Sharp continued to make advancements in display technology; the Zaurus gained additional multimedia capabilities, such as video playback, with the introduction of the MI-E1 in Japan in November 2000. The MI-E1 was also the first Zaurus to support both Secure Digital and Compact Flash memory cards, a feature which would become standard on future models as well.

Although the MI series sold well in Japan, it was never released in either the USA or Europe, and the Japanese user interface was never translated into any other language. The machines released outside Japan were the Linux based SL series, the first of which was the SL-5000D &quot;developer edition&quot;. This was shortly followed by the SL-5500; both used &#x27;Embedix&#x27; - an embedded version of the Linux operating system developed by Lineo - combined with Qtopia, the Qt toolkit-based embedded application environment developed by Trolltech.

The development of the MI series in Japan was continued for a while, but the MI-E25DC has been officially declared to be the last MI-Series Zaurus.

Sharp has continued development of the SL series in Japan releasing the SL-C700, C750, C760 and C860 models which all feature 640x480 VGA screen resolution. They are all based on faster 400 MHz Intel XScale technology, although the SL-C700 was flawed and the apparent speed was the same as the 206 MHz SL-5500. All four of the SL-C models are clamshell type devices with the unusual ability to rotate the screen. This allows the device to be used in landscape mode with the keyboard, much like a miniature notebook PC, or in portrait mode as a PDA.

Sharp introduced a very different device from the clamshells in the form of the SL-6000 in early 2004; the SL-6000L (Wi-Fi only, no Bluetooth) was sold in North America, the last and only device since the 5xxx series to be officially sold outside Japan. It returned to the slider form of the 5xxx, but with a VGA display; a slider with a few key buttons covered a thumbboard. There was a joint project with IBM; the 6000 did not gain mass popularity and Amazon sold off their remaindered stock.

In October 2004 Sharp announced the SL-C3000 - the world&#x27;s first PDA with an integrated hard disk drive (preceding the Palm Life Drive). It featured a similar hardware and software specification to the earlier C860 model; the key differences were that it only had 16 MB of flash memory yet gained an internal 4 GB Hitachi microdrive, a USB Host port, and &quot;lost&quot; the serial port (in some cases the components were not fitted to the motherboard or were incapable of driving the regular serial adaptor cables). The keyboard feel and layout changed somewhat, and most owners preferred it over the 760/860.

In March 2005 the C3000 product was joined by the SL-C1000 which returned to the traditional 128 MB flash memory but lost the internal micro-drive. The C1000 was cheaper, lighter, faster in execution due to running from flash memory, but would require the user to &quot;waste&quot; the SD or CF card slots to fit a memory card for mass storage; at the time the largest card supported was 1GB. The C1000 cannot be upgraded to fit an internal micro-drive because vital components were missing, but the space can be used to fit internal Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules using the USB host facility.

In June 2005, Sharp released the SL-C3100, which had flash capacity of the C1000 yet also had the micro-drive, and proved a very popular model indeed. The 1000, 3000 and 3100 models were overclockable, boosting the device&#x27;s ability to play back video more smoothly.

In March 2006 the latest model launched, predictably labelled as the SL-C3200. It is basically an SL-C3100 but with the newer 6 GB Hitachi micro-drive and another tweak to the case colours. The Intel PXA270 CPU is a later variant, and some would regard as inferior because it cannot be overclocked so highly. The kernel gained a vital tweak to the Sharp proprietary SD/MMC module and allowed 4GB SD cards to be used (and this was quickly borrowed by 3000 and 3100 owners). The software package gained text-to-speech software from Nuance Communications and an upgraded dictionary.

While the SL series devices have long been sold only in Japan, there are companies in Japan who specialise in exporting them worldwide; sometimes without modifying them at all, sometimes an English conversion is available at extra cost. Not all Zaurus models came from Sharp with universal (100/110/240 V) power supplies (the Zaurus takes a regulated 5 V/1 A supply), so either an additional or an exchanged power adaptor would be needed, and not all exporters provide this by default.

There are also companies in the US, UK and DE who are unofficial resellers; one notable example is Trisoft who prepare and certify the device to &quot;CE&quot; standard compliance.

Since there is no official export channel from Japan, Sharp offers no warranty or repair service outside Japan, so foreign buyers are dependent on their chosen reseller to handle repairs, usually by sending to their agent in Japan who acts as if the device was owned and used in Japan in order to have it repaired by Sharp, before sending it back to the owner. Whilst Zauruses are actually quite robust devices, due to their miniaturization they are not easily repairable by casual electronics hobbyists.

In January 2007, it was reported that Sharp would discontinue production of the Zaurus line after February 2007. Later, in March, a European supplier tried to buy a batch of Zauruses as demand was still strong and noticed that they were all manufactured after Sharp&#x27;s original cut-off date, however, Sharp was not able to explain its plans.

Their later units were the WS003SH and WS004SH which, whilst adding wireless and cellular phone and data features, ran the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system/application suite.

== Operating systems ==
These are frequently called &#x27;ROMs&#x27; in the community because the Zaurus&#x27; OS is usually stored in embedded flash memory, and are installed using a flashing tool. There&#x27;s also a special &quot;rescue&quot; mode NOR flash (or P2ROM in newer models) in all Zauruses since the 5xxx series which allows
recovery from a corrupted OS.

* OpenZaurus, which uses the OPIE or GPE graphical user interfaces and is designed for the power user. OpenZaurus does not include the proprietary software that comes with Sharp&#x27;s distribution. OpenZaurus development has been dropped in favour of Ångström which is also based on the OpenEmbedded build environment, but supports a larger range of devices, not limited to Zauri.
* Ångström distribution, the replacement for OpenZaurus. OpenZaurus no longer is being developed for, as its developers now work on Ångström distribution. Ångström is an OpenEmbedded build system based Zaurus distribution with its current images being console and an X11 GPE based ROM.
* pdaXrom, a distribution based on the X graphics system and the matchbox/openbox user interface.
* Cacko, an alternative to the original Sharp ROM, it is based on the same Qt graphics system with as many underlying parts of the OS upgraded as possible yet still maintains full compatibility and allows the proprietary Sharp applications to be run.
* In August 2007 a port of Gentoo Linux was started which offers some promise.
* Zubuntu, based on the ARM port of Ubuntu for the clam-shell models C3x00 et al., SL-6000 was started in 2008.
* Arch Linux ARM has been ported in 2015 on the C3x00 models.

For the Sharp and Cacko ROMs, there are third party and somewhat experimental kernels such as &quot;Tetsu&#x27;s&quot; (a Japanese Zaurus expert) which offer interesting optimisations and drivers for unusual hardware. It is possible to replace only the Linux kernel which can give better performance while maintaining compatibility and retaining installed software that comes with a &quot;stock&quot; ROM.

As well as the choice of GUI (qt/qtopia, X11 + matchbox, X11 + E17 etc.), one key difference is the choice of whether the kernel was built with using ARM standard EABI or not, and whether it uses software or hardware floating point (code using hardware floating point is actually slower because the hardware doesn&#x27;t support it, so those instructions cause an exception which then has to be handled by the kernel, with noticeable overhead).

There was a port of OpenBSD for several Zaurus models. The port is available on the SL-C3000, SL-C3100, and SL-C3200 with development continuing in order to expand support to the C860 and C1000. This port of OpenBSD does not however replace the original operating system entirely, nor is it made available as a ROM image, instead it uses the original Linux install as a bootloader and installs the same as OpenBSD would on any other platform. There is also a NetBSD port is in development, based on the work from OpenBSD. In early September 2016, the OpenBSD Project ceased support for the Zaurus port of their operating system.

== Software ==
With the switch to the Linux operating system the Zaurus became capable of running variations of a wide variety of proprietary and open source software, including web and FTP servers, databases, and compilers. Developers have created several replacement Linux distributions for the Zaurus.
Software provided by Sharp includes basic PDA packages such as a datebook, addressbook, and to do list. These PIM applications are fairly unsophisticated, and a number of individuals and groups have developed alternatives. One popular - and free - alternative that runs on the Sharp ROM and OpenZaurus as well as Windows and Linux is the KDE PIM/Platform-independent set of applications. KDE PIM/PI is based on PIM applications from the KDE desktop suite for Linux. KDE PIM/PI includes KOrganizer/Platform-independent (or KOPI), KAddressbook/Platform-independent (or KAPI), K-OpieMail/pi (or OMPI), K-Phone/pi (kppi) and PwM/PI, a password manager with strong encryption.

In addition to standard PDA applications there are many programs available that are more commonly associated with desktop and laptop computers. Among these are a selection of office programs, web browsers, media applications and many others. Although primarily a business machine, a selection of games were developed for the platform by Sonic Powered, as well as open-source video games by New Breed Software, Karl Bartel, and Silvio Iaccarino, among others, as well as video game emulators. Several of these developers had previously produced games for the Agenda VR3 PDA which also ran Linux.

<text>The following is a list of aquarium diseases. Aquarium fish are often susceptible to numerous diseases, due to the artificially limited and concentrated environment. New fish can sometimes introduce diseases to aquaria, and these can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Most fish diseases are also aggravated when the fish is stressed.

Common aquarium diseases include the following:

== Freshwater ==
== Saltwater ==

* &quot;Cryptocaryon&quot; (marine ich)
* Marine velvet or coral reef fish disease
* Anemonefish disease

== Both ==
==Quarantine==
The goal of quarantine is to prevent problems in the main tank due to sickness. A quarantine tank should be used before to introduce any newly acquired animals in the main tank and to treat fish that are already sick. By doing this, the aquarist can avoid the spread of the disease and make it easier to treat the fish.

<doc id="247149" wikidata="Q2917508" url="?curid=247149" title="Music of Ethiopia">
<text>Ethiopian music is a term that can mean any music of Ethiopian origin, however, often it is applied to a genre, a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.

The music of the Ethiopian Highlands uses a fundamental modal system called &quot;qenet&quot;, of which there are four main modes: , , , and . Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor. Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence. When played on traditional instruments, these modes are generally not tempered (that is, the pitches may deviate slightly from the Western-tempered tuning system), but when played on Western instruments such as pianos and guitars, they are played using the Western-tempered tuning system.

Music in the Ethiopian highlands is generally monophonic or heterophonic. In certain southern areas, some music is polyphonic. Dorze polyphonic singing (&quot;edho&quot;) may employ up to five parts; Majangir, four parts.

==Musical instruments==

===Chordophones===

In the highlands, traditional string instruments include the &quot;:masenqo&quot; (also known as ), a one-string bowed :lute; the &quot;:krar&quot; (also known as ), a six-string :lyre; and the &quot;:begena&quot;, a large ten-string lyre.
The (a five-string lyre) and :musical bows (including an unusual three-string variant) are among the chordophones found in the south.

===Aerophones===
The is a bamboo flute that is common in the highlands. Trumpet-like instruments include the ceremonial used in some regions, and the (animal horn; compare shofar) found mainly in the south. flutes have no finger holes, and produce only two tones, the fundamental and a fourth or fifth interval. These may be metal (generally found in the north) or bamboo (in the south). The Konso and other people in the south play , or pan flutes. It has 6 holes.

===Idiophones===
In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, liturgical music employs the senasel (a sistrum). Additionally, the clergy will use walking stick, called mequamia, to maintain rhythm. Rural churches historically used a to call the faithful to prayer. They are made from stone slabs or pieces of wood. The Beta Israel use a small gong called a as liturgical accompaniment, though may also refer to a small bell. The , a lamellophone, is used among the Nuer, Anuak, Majangir, Surma, and other Nilotic groups. Metal leg rattles are common throughout the south.

===Membranophones===
The is a large hand drum used in the Orthodox Christian liturgy. Smaller kebero drums may be used in secular celebrations. The , played with a curved stick, is usually found in a secular context such as royal functions or the announcement of proclamations, though it has a liturgical function among the Beta Israel. The Gurage and certain other populations in the lowlands commonly play the , a small hand drum sometimes made of clay. In Gambela Region, the Anuak specify three different kinds of drums: the (small drum), the (medium drum), and the (big drum), with different rhythmic patterns attached to certain song genres. There is a special kind of drum referred to as tom-tom that is used in the southwestern part of the country, in Gambella Region. The beating of drums in general is very characteristic of the fast songs played in the south of the country, where you have the Kenbata, Hadiya, Gedeo, Sidama, and others performing their colorful, traditional belly dances that are reminiscent of the Middle Eastern or Arabic dancers.

==Traditional music and characteristics==
Ethiopia has a long and at times tormented history. It has an equally long and fascinating history of arts and culture. Ethiopia and its folk music and culture have a long step in the history of civilization. The music of Ethiopia is a reflection of all the historical and social episodes, such as the military campaigns that various warlords or chiefs had to launch. The music is about war as well as patriotism, songs of victory, and songs that incite support for a certain crusade. The music is also about love, with wonderful melodies and poetic lyrics. The spirituality of Ethiopians is expressed in the form of music. All these types of tunes and melodies are prepared and performed using various traditional instruments.

Music in the country can be traced back to the Ethiopian highlands, where the strong oral-literary custom was born. In this area, traditional music is played by mostly itinerant musicians called azmaris, who are regarded with respect in their society. As this form of music slowly spread across the country, it appropriated aspects of the regions it infiltrated, depending on the local customs, culture, and religion. The music and culture of Ethiopia has been influenced by Christianity, Islam, and Judaism among other factors. Ethiopia has a diverse number of ethnic groups, more than 75 ethnic groups with each ethnic group having diverse traditional music and sounds.

==Characteristics of the traditional music==

Music from the highlands of Ethiopia has a modal system called qenet which consists of four main modes; tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy. It also consists of three additional modes; tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.
• Pentatonic Scales: Ethiopian music has a pentatonic modal system with long intervals between notes contributing to the distinctive nature of the music.

Complex rhythms: Ethiopian music is known for its intricate rhythmic patterns, as with the case for many African music, often featuring irregular meters and syncopation. 

Vocal styles: Traditional Ethiopian singing includes a variety of vocal techniques, such as melismatic, ornamentation, vocal slides, and call-and-response structures. In terms of instruments, Ethiopian music incorporates a wide variety of instruments. These instruments include the masinko, the krar, the washint, the begena, the kebero, and the tom-tom. 

Regional variations: Different regions of Ethiopia have their distinct musical styles since it has more than 75 ethnic groups with each ethnic group having diverse traditional music and sounds.

Cultural significance: Music holds deep cultural and social significance in Ethiopia, often accompanying religious ceremonies, cultural festivals, and social gatherings. Stimulating and expressing emotion in the performers, and imparting it to the listeners. This is a key trait of the Ethiopian traditional music. The emotion may be religious exaltation, as in the creation chant and a sacred song; grief, as in the laments; longing or passion, as in the love song.

==Traditional dances==

The various tribes and ethnic groups of Ethiopia have their distinct music, cultures, and traditions. According to some analysts, Ethiopian dances are not divided according to their function but rather according to their uniqueness and individuality. Therefore, there are over 150 unique dance movements across Ethiopia. Oromia region is the largest and their dance styles are different depending on place. Some of the famous dances are “Shewa Oromo” and “Harar Oromo”. Especially, Shewa Oromo dance has unique costumes as well as steps. Women wear leather-made wild two-piece costumes decorated with shells. Men wear fur skin like a lion’s mane on the head and use sticks for dance. What is most surprising is women’s very fast and sharp neck motion. For example, the Tigrayans to the north have a smooth, circular dance routine characterized by shoulder and neck movements. The Amharas at the center of the country have a dance style dominated by upper body and neck movements. The Oromos at the center and south have a jumping style and full-bodied dance routine. The Gurages have an acrobatic dance that requires high levels of arm, leg, and body coordination. The Welayita, Kenbata, Sidama, Dawro, and others among the peoples of the South Region have very attractive belly dances that are hugely popular throughout the nation. The beats are quite rhythmic and fast. Eskista is a traditional Ethiopian cultural dance from the Amhara ethnic group performed by men, women, and children. It&#x27;s known for its unique emphasis on intense shoulder movement which it shares with the shim-shim dance of the Tigrinya people in neighboring Eritrea. The dance is characterized by rolling and bouncing the shoulders, jilting the chest, and thrusting the neck in various directions. Motives and characteristics of the dance often vary according to the performers and the context, for example, war songs, hunting songs, shepherd songs, love songs, and work songs. The best dancer is typically appointed as the leader of the group and/or the best singer. Eskista dance brings the dancer into a role as a storyteller, who then expresses with his or her body the cultural traditions and life of the community. The dance, as well as the music and singing, serve as symbolic messages of Ethiopian society as a whole.

==Religious and secular music==
Religious music is very important and plays significant role to Ethiopian Orthodox society. The term &quot;mezmur&quot; is instinctively denotes an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo music. There are also wide range of Islamic music. Protestant music also plays a dominant role since booming its distribution via CDs in 2000s, and recently it evolves from digital downloads.
Some Ethiopian religious music has an ancient Christian element, traced to Yared, who lived during the reign of Emperor Gebre Meskel (Son of Kaleb of Aksumite Empire) in the 6th century. Yared was considered the father of Ethiopian-Eritrean traditional music as well as he composed chant or &quot;Zema&quot; and the use in liturgical music. &quot;Zema&quot; is divided into three chant modes: Ge&#x27;ez, Ezel and Araray. Manzuma, which developed around 1907, is sung in Amharic and Oromo most notably in Dire Dawa, Harar and Jimma where Ethiopian Muslims reside. In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by mostly itinerant musicians called , who are regarded with respect in Ethiopian society.

==Popular music==

Ethiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from Jerusalem in the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch) during the reign of Haile Selassie. This band, which arrived in Addis Ababa on 6 September 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of World War II, large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Imperial Bodyguard Band.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included Mahmoud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Hirut Bekele, Ali Birra, Ayalew Mesfin, Kiros Alemayehu, Muluken Melesse and Tilahun Gessesse, while popular folk musicians included Alemu Aga, Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen, Asnaketch Worku, and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator Mulatu Astatke. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips-Ethiopia were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997, Buda Musique&#x27;s &quot;Éthiopiques&quot; series has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.

During the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Walias Band and Roha Band, though the singer Neway Debebe was most popular. He helped to popularize the use of (wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qiné, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.

===Contemporary scene===
The most prominent internationally acclaimed Ethiopian singers are Aster Aweke, Alemayehu Eshete, Gigi, Teddy Afro, Tilahun Gessesse and Mahmoud Ahmed. Tilahun Gessesse was popular through 20th-century and nicknamed &quot;The Voice&quot; due to his prolong tenor vocal. In 2001, Teddy Afro debut his album &quot;Abugida&quot; and quickly become famous singer in his generation, nicknamed &quot;Blatenaw&quot; (English: The boy). Some commentators also compare Teddy Afro with Tilahun Gessesse by musical style and patriotic sentiments. Through her performing with prominent Western jazz musicians such as Bill Laswell (who is also her husband) and Herbie Hancock, Gigi has brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the United States, where she now lives. Through her 1999 album &quot;Hagere&quot; and &quot;Abebayehosh&quot;, Aster Aweke is renowned for her voice that attracted broader audience.

Another noteworthy singer is Neway Debebe, who was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as &quot;Yetekemt Abeba,&quot; &quot;Metekatun Ateye,&quot; &quot;Safsaf,&quot; and &quot;Gedam&quot; – among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main on his 2005 album &quot;Ras Deshen&quot;.

&quot;Éthiopiques&quot; producer Francis Falceto criticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using synthesizers. Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene. She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.

In the West, several bands were also created in recent years to play music inspired by the &quot;Éthiopiques&quot; series and other examples of Ethiopian music of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. They include Boston&#x27;s Either/Orchestra, Imperial Tiger Orchestra (Switzerland), and Le Tigre des platanes (France).

New genres of music, popular in western countries, such as EDM, rock and hip hop have been introduced in recent years. Musical acts like Jano Band play a new style of music progressive rock, with a mix of Ethiopian music. Hip hop music started influencing Ethiopian music in the early to mid 2000s and culminated with the creation of Ethiopian hip hop, rhymed in the native Amharic language. The earliest and most influential rappers of the hip hop were Teddy Yo and Lij Michael, with the latter being more commercially successful. The success of both Jano Band and Lij Michael led to their inclusion in the 2017 edition of Coke Studio Africa
The electronic dance music in Ethiopia was not fully developed until mid-2010, although some electronic music employment with hip hop element began in the 2000s. 
In 2018, a DJ and recording artist named Rophnan introduced the country to his own version of electronic dance music, winning the album of the year award and changing the mainstream music scene further.

===Record labels===
Since 2016, the most used record label is , while Minew Shewa Entertainment and Admas Music are used as secondary labels. Hope Music Entertainment, Minew Shewa Entertainment and Dire Tube become the country&#x27;s online streaming media in recent years. Dire Tube typically recovers older recordings and music videos. The most notable label throughout the 2000s is , which is still active.

Since 2020s, labels like Ella Records and Bahgna TV become more popular.

<text>In evolutionary biology, mimicry is an evolved resemblance between an organism and another object, often an organism of another species. Mimicry may evolve between different species, or between individuals of the same species. In the simplest case, as in Batesian mimicry, a mimic resembles a model, so as to deceive a dupe, all three being of different species. A Batesian mimic, such as a hoverfly, is harmless, while its model, such as a wasp, is harmful, and is avoided by the dupe, such as an insect-eating bird. Birds hunt by sight, so the mimicry in that case is visual, but in other cases mimicry may make use of any of the senses. Most types of mimicry, including Batesian, are deceptive, as the mimics are not harmful, but Müllerian mimicry, where different harmful species resemble each other, is honest, as when species of wasps and of bees all have genuinely aposematic warning coloration. More complex types may be bipolar, involving only two species, such as when the model and the dupe are the same; this occurs for example in aggressive mimicry, where a predator in wolf-in-sheep&#x27;s-clothing style resembles its prey, allowing it to hunt undetected. Mimicry is not limited to animals; in Pouyannian mimicry, an orchid flower is the mimic, resembling a female bee, its model; the dupe is the male bee of the same species, which tries to copulate with the flower, enabling it to transfer pollen, so the mimicry is again bipolar. In automimicry, another bipolar system, model and mimic are the same, as when blue lycaenid butterflies have &#x27;tails&#x27; or eyespots on their wings that mimic their own heads, misdirecting predator dupes to strike harmlessly. Many other types of mimicry exist.

== Etymology ==

Use of the word dates to 1637. It derives from the Greek term &quot;mimetikos&quot;, &quot;imitative&quot;, in turn from &quot;mimetos&quot;, the verbal adjective of &quot;mimeisthai&quot;, &quot;to imitate&quot;. &quot;Mimicry&quot; was first used in zoology by the English entomologists William Kirby and William Spence in 1823. Originally used to describe people, &quot;mimetic&quot; was used in zoology from 1851.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===

Aristotle wrote in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; that partridges use a deceptive distraction display to lure predators away from their flightless young:

The behaviour is recognised as a form of mimicry by biologists.

=== 19th century ===

In 1823, Kirby and Spence, in their book &quot;An Introduction to Entomology&quot;, used the term &quot;mimicry&quot; informally to depict the way that the structure and coloration of some insects resembled objects in their environments: 

The English naturalist Henry Walter Bates worked for several years on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest. Returning home, he described multiple forms of mimicry in an 1862 paper at the Linnean Society in London, and then in his 1863 book &quot;The Naturalist on the River Amazons&quot;. The term &quot;Batesian mimicry&quot; has since been used in his honour, its usage becoming restricted to the situation in which a harmless mimic gains protection from its predators by resembling a distasteful model. Among the observations in Bates&#x27;s 1862 paper is the statement:

The German naturalist Fritz Müller also spent many years studying butterflies in the Amazon rainforest. He first published a journal article on mimicry in German in 1878, followed in 1879 by a paper to the Entomological Society of London (translated and presented by Ralph Meldola). He described a situation where different species were each unpalatable to predators, and shared similar, genuine, warning signals. Bates found it hard to explain why this should be so, asking why they should need to mimic each other if both were harmful and could warn off predators on their own. Müller put forward the first mathematical model of mimicry for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses the two species, individuals in both those species are more likely to survive, as fewer individuals of either species are killed by the predator. The term Müllerian mimicry, named in his honour, has since been used for this mutualistic form of mimicry.

Müller wrote that

== Overview ==

=== Evolved resemblance ===

Mimicry is an evolved resemblance between an organism and another object, often an organism of another species. Mimicry may evolve between different species, or between individuals of the same species. Often, mimicry functions to protect from predators. Mimicry systems have three basic roles: a mimic, a model, and a dupe. When these correspond to three separate species, the system is called disjunct; when the roles are taken by just two species, the system is called bipolar. Mimicry evolves if a dupe (such as a predator) perceives a mimic (such as a palatable prey) as a model (the organism it resembles), and is deceived to change its behaviour to the mimic&#x27;s selective advantage. The resemblances can be via any sensory modality, including any combination of visual, acoustic, chemical, tactile, or electric. Mimicry may be to the advantage of both organisms that share a resemblance, in which case it is mutualistic; or it can be to the detriment of one, making it parasitic or competitive. The evolutionary convergence between groups is driven by the selective action of a dupe. Birds, for example, use sight to identify palatable insects, whilst avoiding noxious ones. Over time, palatable insects may evolve to resemble noxious ones, making them mimics and the noxious ones models. Models do not have to be more abundant than mimics. In the case of mutualism, each model is also a mimic; all such species can be called &quot;co-mimics&quot;. Many harmless species such as hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Müllerian mimicry rings of co-mimics. In the evolution of wasp-like appearance, it has been argued that insects evolve to masquerade wasps since predatory wasps do not attack each other, and that this mimetic resemblance has had the useful side-effect of deterring vertebrate predators.
Mimicry can result in an evolutionary arms race if mimicry negatively affects the model, in which case the model can evolve a different appearance from the mimic.p161 Mimics may have different models for different life cycle stages, or they may be polymorphic, with different individuals imitating different models, as occurs in Heliconius butterflies. Models tend to be relatively closely related to their mimics, but mimicry can be of vastly different species, for example when spiders mimic ants. Most known mimics are insects, though many other examples including vertebrates, plants, and fungi exist.

=== Evolutionary explanations ===

It is widely accepted that mimicry evolves as a positive adaptation. The lepidopterist and novelist Vladimir Nabokov however argued that although natural selection might stabilize a &quot;mimic&quot; form, it would not be necessary to create it. The most widely accepted model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene for the development of butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in &quot;Papilio polytes&quot; is controlled by the &quot;doublesex&quot; gene.

Some mimicry is imperfect. Natural selection drives mimicry only far enough to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a coral snake, the mimic is sufficiently protected.

Convergent evolution is an alternative explanation for why coral reef fish have come to resemble each other; the same applies to benthic marine invertebrates such as sponges and nudibranchs.
=== Living and non-living models ===

In its broadest definition, mimicry can include non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate, and the mimicry&#x27;s purpose is crypsis. For example, animals such as flower mantises, planthoppers, comma and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves, bird droppings or flowers. In addition, predators may make use of resemblance to harmless objects in aggressive masquerade, to enable them to approach prey. This wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing strategy differs from the more specific resemblance to the prey in aggressive mimicry, where the prey is both model and dupe. 

Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism&#x27;s eyes, and whether or not animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. The model is usually another species, except in automimicry, where members of the species mimic other members, or other parts of their own bodies, and in inter-sexual mimicry, where members of one sex mimic members of the other.

=== Types ===

Many types of mimicry have been described. An overview of each follows, highlighting the similarities and differences between the various forms. Classification is often based on function with respect to the mimic (e.g., avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g., automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food). The terminology used has been debated, as classifications have differed or overlapped; attempts to clarify definitions have led to the partial replacement of old terms with new ones. 

== Defensive ==

Mimicry is defensive or protective when organisms are able to avoid harmful encounters by deceiving enemies into treating them as something else.

=== Batesian ===

In Batesian mimicry, the mimic resembles the model, but does not have the attribute that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability, or the ability to sting). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf&#x27;s clothing. Mimics are less likely to be found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. Such negative frequency-dependent selection applies in most forms of mimicry. Specifically, Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Batesian systems are therefore most likely to be stable where the model is more abundant than the mimic. 

There are many Batesian mimics among butterflies and moths. &quot;Consul fabius&quot; and &quot;Eresia eunice&quot; imitate unpalatable &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies such as &quot;H. ismenius&quot;. &quot;Limenitis arthemis&quot; imitate the poisonous pipevine swallowtail (&quot;Battus philenor&quot;). Several palatable moths produce ultrasonic click calls to mimic unpalatable tiger moths. Octopuses of the genus &quot;Thaumoctopus&quot; (the mimic octopus) are able to intentionally alter their body shape and coloration to resemble dangerous sea snakes or lionfish. In the Amazon, the helmeted woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus galeatus&quot;), a rare species which lives in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, has a similar red crest, black back, and barred underside to two larger woodpeckers: &quot;Dryocopus lineatus&quot; and &quot;Campephilus robustus&quot;. This mimicry reduces attacks on &quot;D. galeatus&quot;. Batesian mimicry occurs in the plant kingdom, where the chameleon vine adapts its leaf shape and colour to match that of the plant it is climbing.

=== Müllerian ===

In Müllerian mimicry, two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable), as first described in &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism. The signal receiver also benefits by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it is able to generalize the pattern to potentially harmful encounters. The distinction between mimic and model that is clear in Batesian mimicry is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it makes more sense to speak of each as a &quot;co-mimic&quot; than of distinct &#x27;mimic&#x27; and &#x27;model&#x27; species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the mimetic species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.

=== Emsleyan/Mertensian ===

Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry describes the unusual case where a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by M. G. Emsley in 1966 as a possible explanation for how a predator can learn to avoid a very dangerous aposematic animal, such as a coral snake, when the predator is very likely to die, making learning unlikely. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. The scenario is unlike Müllerian mimicry, where the most harmful species is the model. But if a predator dies on its first encounter with a deadly snake, it has no occasion to learn to recognize the snake&#x27;s warning signals. There would then be no advantage for an extremely deadly snake in being aposematic: any predator that attacked it would be killed before it could learn to avoid the deadly prey, so the snake would be better off being camouflaged to avoid attacks. But if the predator first learnt to avoid a less deadly warning-coloured snake, the deadly species could profit by mimicking the less dangerous snake. Some harmless milk snakes (&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum&quot;), the moderately toxic false coral snakes (&quot;Erythrolamprus aesculapii&quot;), and the deadly coral snakes (&quot;Micrurus&quot;) all have a red background color with black and white/yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, while the false coral snakes are the model.

=== Wasmannian ===

In Wasmannian mimicry, the mimic resembles a model that it lives along with in a nest or colony. Most of the models here are eusocial insects, principally ants.

=== Gilbertian ===

Gilbertian mimicry is bipolar, involving only two species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, the reverse of host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It was coined by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare mimicry systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert who described it in 1975. The classical instance of Gilbertian mimicry is in the plant genus &quot;Passiflora&quot;, which is grazed by the micropredator larvae of some &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies. The host plants have evolved stipules that mimic mature &quot;Heliconius&quot; eggs near the point of hatching. The butterflies avoid laying eggs near existing ones, reducing intraspecific competition between caterpillars, which are also cannibalistic, so those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. The stipules thus appear to have evolved as Gilbertian mimics of butterfly eggs, under selection pressure from these caterpillars.

=== Browerian ===

Browerian mimicry, named after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower who first described it in 1967, is a postulated form of &quot;automimicry&quot;; where the model belongs to the same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the subfamily Danainae, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet, some individuals are more toxic than the rest, which profit from the toxicity of those individuals, just as hoverflies benefit from mimicking well-defended wasps.

=== Misdirection by automimicry ===

One form of automimicry is where one part of an organism&#x27;s body resembles another part. For example, the tails of some snakes resemble their heads; they move backwards when threatened and present the predator with the tail, improving their chances of escape without fatal harm. Some fishes have eyespots near their tails, and when mildly alarmed swim slowly backwards, presenting the tail as a head. Some insects such as some lycaenid butterflies have tail patterns and appendages of various degrees of sophistication that promote attacks at the rear rather than at the head. Several species of pygmy owl bear &quot;false eyes&quot; on the back of the head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare. Many insects have filamentous &quot;tails&quot; at the ends of their wings and patterns of markings on the wings themselves. These combine to create a &quot;false head&quot;. This misdirects predators such as birds and jumping spiders. Spectacular examples occur in the hairstreak butterflies; when perching on a twig or flower, they commonly do so upside down and shift their rear wings repeatedly, causing antenna-like movements of the &quot;tails&quot; on their wings. Studies of rear-wing damage support the hypothesis that this strategy is effective in deflecting attacks from the insect&#x27;s head.

== Aggressive ==

=== Predators ===

Aggressive mimicry is found in predators or parasites that share some of the characteristics of a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey or host; the strategy resembles a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing, though no conscious deceptive intent is involved. The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that does not threaten the prey or host. 

Several spiders use aggressive mimicry to lure prey. Species such as the silver argiope (&quot;Argiope argentata&quot;) employ prominent patterns in the middle of their webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by the ability of bees to remember web patterns.

Another case is where males are lured towards what seems to be a sexually receptive female. The model in this situation is the same species as the dupe. Female fireflies of the genus &quot;Photuris&quot; emit light signals that mimic the mating signals of females of the genus &quot;Photinus&quot;. Male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these &quot;femmes fatales&quot;, and are captured and eaten. Each female has a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the flashes of the female of the corresponding species.

Some carnivorous plants may be able to increase their rate of capturing insect prey through mimicry.

A different aggressive strategy is to mimic a mutualistic symbiont of the prey. Cleaner fish eat parasites and dead skin from client fish. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, the sabre-toothed blenny or false cleanerfish (&quot;Aspidontus taeniatus&quot;) mimics the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (&quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot;), which is recognized by other fishes as a cleaner. The false cleanerfish resembles the cleaner, and mimics the cleaner&#x27;s &quot;dance&quot;. Once it is allowed close to the client, it attacks, biting off a piece of its fin before fleeing. Fish wounded in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close they also become much more cautious of the model.

A mechanism that does not involve any luring is seen in the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, effectively camouflaged as a vulture which poses no threat to the hawk&#x27;s prey. It hunts by suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey.

=== Parasites ===

Parasites can be aggressive mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. They can mimic their hosts&#x27; natural prey, allowing themselves to be eaten as a pathway into their host. &quot;Leucochloridium&quot;, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by &quot;Succinea&quot;, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host&#x27;s intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail&#x27;s eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can bridge the gap between hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (&quot;Myrmeconema neotropicum&quot;) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant &quot;Cephalotes atratus&quot; to make it appear like the ripe fruits of &quot;Hyeronima alchorneoides&quot;. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds.

== Reproductive ==

Reproductive mimicry occurs when the actions of the dupe directly aid in the mimic&#x27;s reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they seem to offer and it may occur in Papua New Guinea fireflies, in which the signal of &quot;Pteroptyx effulgens&quot; is used by &quot;P. tarsalis&quot; to form aggregations to attract females. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, vocal mimicry in birds, and aggressive and Batesian mimicry in brood parasite-host systems.

=== Bakerian and Dodsonian ===

Bakerian mimicry, named after Herbert G. Baker, is a form of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, cheating pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.

In Dodsonian mimicry, named after Calaway H. Dodson, the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. By resembling the model, a flower can lure its pollinators without offering nectar. The mechanism occurs in several orchids, including &quot;Epidendrum ibaguense&quot; which mimics flowers of &quot;Lantana camara&quot; and &quot;Asclepias curassavica&quot;, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds.

=== Kirbyan mimicry, brood parasitism ===

Brood parasitism or Kirbyan mimicry is a two species system where a brood parasite mimics its host. Cuckoos are a canonical example; the female cuckoo has its offspring raised by a bird of a different species, cutting down the biological mother&#x27;s parental investment. The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called gentes (gens, singular). &quot;Intraspecific&quot; brood parasitism, where a female lays in a conspecific&#x27;s nest, as illustrated by the goldeneye duck (&quot;Bucephala clangula&quot;), do not involve mimicry The parasitic butterfly &quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot; parasitizes the ant species &quot;Myrmica schencki&quot; by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae. This enables the larvae to be brought directly into the ant&#x27;s nest. 

=== Pouyannian ===

In Pouyannian mimicry, a flower mimics a female of a certain insect species, inducing the males of that species to try to copulate with the flower. This is much like aggressive mimicry in fireflies, but with a more benign outcome for the pollinator. The mechanism is named after Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne, who first described the phenomenon. It is most common in orchids, which mimic females of the order Hymenoptera (generally bees and wasps), and may account for around 60% of pollinations. Depending on the morphology of the flower, a pollen sac called a pollinium is attached to the head or abdomen of the male. This is then transferred to the stigma of the next flower the male tries to inseminate, resulting in pollination. The mimicry is a combination of visual, by olfaction, and by touch.

=== Vavilovian ===

Vavilovian mimicry is found in weeds that come to share characteristics with a domesticated plant through unintentional selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Selection against the weed may occur either by manually killing the weed, or by separating its seeds from those of the crop by winnowing. Vavilovian mimicry illustrates unintentional selection by man. Weeders do not want to select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, early barnyard grass, &quot;Echinochloa oryzoides&quot;, is a weed in rice fields and looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, as in the case of rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops &quot;secondary crops&quot;.

=== Inter-sexual mimicry ===

Inter-sexual mimicry (a type of automimicry, as it is within a single species) occurs when individuals of one sex in a species mimic members of the opposite sex to facilitate sneak mating. An example is the three male forms of the marine isopod &quot;Paracerceis sculpta&quot;. Alpha males are the largest and guard a harem of females. Beta males mimic females and manage to enter the harem of females without being detected by the alpha males allowing them to mate. Gamma males are the smallest males and mimic juveniles. This also allows them to mate with the females without the alpha males detecting them. Similarly, among common side-blotched lizards, some males mimic the yellow throat coloration and even mating rejection behaviour of the other sex to sneak matings with guarded females. These males look and behave like unreceptive females. This strategy is effective against &quot;usurper&quot; males with orange throats, but ineffective against blue throated &quot;guarder&quot; males, which chase them away. Female spotted hyenas have pseudo-penises that make them look like males.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry, complex analysis and algebraic number theory, an abelian variety is a smooth projective algebraic variety that is also an algebraic group, i.e., has a group law that can be defined by regular functions. Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.

An abelian variety can be defined by equations having coefficients in any field; the variety is then said to be defined &quot;over&quot; that field. Historically the first abelian varieties to be studied were those defined over the field of complex numbers. Such abelian varieties turn out to be exactly those complex tori that can be holomorphically embedded into a complex projective space. 

Abelian varieties defined over algebraic number fields are a special case, which is important also from the viewpoint of number theory. Localization techniques lead naturally from abelian varieties defined over number fields to ones defined over finite fields and various local fields. Since a number field is the fraction field of a Dedekind domain, for any nonzero prime of your Dedekind domain, there is a map from the Dedekind domain to the quotient of the Dedekind domain by the prime, which is a finite field for all finite primes. This induces a map from the fraction field to any such finite field. Given a curve with equation defined over the number field, we can apply this map to the coefficients to get a curve defined over some finite field, where the choices of finite field correspond to the finite primes of the number field.

Abelian varieties appear naturally as Jacobian varieties (the connected components of zero in Picard varieties) and Albanese varieties of other algebraic varieties. The group law of an abelian variety is necessarily commutative and the variety is non-singular. An elliptic curve is an abelian variety of dimension 1. Abelian varieties have Kodaira dimension 0.

== History and motivation ==

In the early nineteenth century, the theory of elliptic functions succeeded in giving a basis for the theory of elliptic integrals, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the square roots of cubic and quartic polynomials. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say quintics, what would happen?

In the work of Niels Abel and Carl Jacobi, the answer was formulated: this would involve functions of two complex variables, having four independent &quot;periods&quot; (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an abelian surface): what would now be called the &quot;Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2&quot;.

After Abel and Jacobi, some of the most important contributors to the theory of abelian functions were Riemann, Weierstrass, Frobenius, Poincaré, and Picard. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature.

By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions. Eventually, in the 1920s, Lefschetz laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to be the first to use the name &quot;abelian variety&quot;. It was André Weil in the 1940s who gave the subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.

Today, abelian varieties form an important tool in number theory, in dynamical systems (more specifically in the study of Hamiltonian systems), and in algebraic geometry (especially Picard varieties and Albanese varieties).

== Analytic theory ==

=== Definition ===
A complex torus of dimension &quot;g&quot; is a torus of real dimension 2&quot;g&quot; that carries the structure of a complex manifold. It can always be obtained as the quotient of a &quot;g&quot;-dimensional complex vector space by a lattice of rank 2&quot;g&quot;. A complex abelian variety of dimension &quot;g&quot; is a complex torus of dimension &quot;g&quot; that is also a projective algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers. By invoking the Kodaira embedding theorem and Chow&#x27;s theorem, one may equivalently define a complex abelian variety of dimension &quot;g&quot; to be a complex torus of dimension &quot;g&quot; that admits a positive line bundle. Since they are complex tori, abelian varieties carry the structure of a group. A morphism of abelian varieties is a morphism of the underlying algebraic varieties that preserves the identity element for the group structure. An isogeny is a finite-to-one morphism.

When a complex torus carries the structure of an algebraic variety, this structure is necessarily unique. In the case formula_1, the notion of abelian variety is the same as that of elliptic curve, and every complex torus gives rise to such a curve; for formula_2 it has been known since Riemann that the algebraic variety condition imposes extra constraints on a complex torus.

=== Riemann conditions ===
The following criterion by Riemann decides whether or not a given complex torus is an abelian variety, i.e., whether or not it can be embedded into a projective space. Let &quot;X&quot; be a &quot;g&quot;-dimensional torus given as formula_3 where &quot;V&quot; is a complex vector space of dimension &quot;g&quot; and &quot;L&quot; is a lattice in &quot;V&quot;. Then &quot;X&quot; is an abelian variety if and only if there exists a positive definite hermitian form on &quot;V&quot; whose imaginary part takes integral values on formula_4. Such a form on &quot;X&quot; is usually called a (non-degenerate) Riemann form. Choosing a basis for &quot;V&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, one can make this condition more explicit. There are several equivalent formulations of this; all of them are known as the Riemann conditions.

=== The Jacobian of an algebraic curve ===
Every algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; of genus formula_5 is associated with an abelian variety &quot;J&quot; of dimension &quot;g&quot;, by means of an analytic map of &quot;C&quot; into &quot;J&quot;. As a torus, &quot;J&quot; carries a commutative group structure, and the image of &quot;C&quot; generates &quot;J&quot; as a group. More accurately, &quot;J&quot; is covered by formula_6: any point in &quot;J&quot; comes from a &quot;g&quot;-tuple of points in &quot;C&quot;. The study of differential forms on &quot;C&quot;, which give rise to the &quot;abelian integrals&quot; with which the theory started, can be derived from the simpler, translation-invariant theory of differentials on &quot;J&quot;. The abelian variety &quot;J&quot; is called the Jacobian variety of &quot;C&quot;, for any non-singular curve &quot;C&quot; over the complex numbers. From the point of view of birational geometry, its function field is the fixed field of the symmetric group on &quot;g&quot; letters acting on the function field of formula_6.

=== Abelian functions ===
An abelian function is a meromorphic function on an abelian variety, which may be regarded therefore as a periodic function of &quot;n&quot; complex variables, having 2&quot;n&quot; independent periods; equivalently, it is a function in the function field of an abelian variety. For example, in the nineteenth century there was much interest in hyperelliptic integrals that may be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. This comes down to asking that &quot;J&quot; is a product of elliptic curves, up to an isogeny.

=== Important theorems ===
One important structure theorem of abelian varieties is Matsusaka&#x27;s theorem. It states that over an algebraically closed field every abelian variety formula_8 is the quotient of the Jacobian of some curve; that is, there is some surjection of abelian varieties formula_9 where formula_10 is a Jacobian. This theorem remains true if the ground field is infinite.

== Algebraic definition ==
Two equivalent definitions of abelian variety over a general field &quot;k&quot; are commonly in use:
* a connected and complete algebraic group over &quot;k&quot;
* a connected and projective algebraic group over &quot;k&quot;.
When the base is the field formula_11 of complex numbers, these notions coincide with the previous definition. Over all bases, elliptic curves are abelian varieties of dimension 1.

In the early 1940s, Weil used the first definition (over an arbitrary base field) but could not at first prove that it implied the second. Only in 1948 did he prove that complete algebraic groups can be embedded into projective space. Meanwhile, in order to make the proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields that he had announced in 1940 work, he had to introduce the notion of an abstract variety and to rewrite the foundations of algebraic geometry to work with varieties without projective embeddings (see also the history section in the Algebraic Geometry article).

== Structure of the group of points ==
By the definitions, an abelian variety is a group variety. Its group of points can be proven to be commutative.

For the field formula_11, and hence by the Lefschetz principle for every algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the torsion group of an abelian variety of dimension &quot;g&quot; is isomorphic to formula_13. Hence, its &quot;n&quot;-torsion part is isomorphic to formula_14, i.e., the product of 2&quot;g&quot; copies of the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;.

When the base field is an algebraically closed field of characteristic &quot;p&quot;, the &quot;n&quot;-torsion is still isomorphic to formula_14 when &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are coprime. When &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are not coprime, the same result can be recovered provided one interprets it as saying that the &quot;n&quot;-torsion defines a finite flat group scheme of rank 2&quot;g&quot;. If instead of looking at the full scheme structure on the &quot;n&quot;-torsion, one considers only the geometric points, one obtains a new invariant for varieties in characteristic &quot;p&quot; (the so-called &quot;p&quot;-rank when formula_16).

The group of &quot;k&quot;-rational points for a global field &quot;k&quot; is finitely generated by the Mordell-Weil theorem. Hence, by the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of a free abelian group formula_17 and a finite commutative group for some non-negative integer &quot;r&quot; called the rank of the abelian variety. Similar results hold for some other classes of fields &quot;k&quot;.

==Products==
The product of an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; of dimension &quot;m&quot;, and an abelian variety &quot;B&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot;, over the same field, is an abelian variety of dimension formula_18. An abelian variety is simple if it is not isogenous to a product of abelian varieties of lower dimension. Any abelian variety is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties.

== Polarisation and dual abelian variety ==

=== Dual abelian variety ===

To an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, one associates a dual abelian variety formula_19 (over the same field), which is the solution to the following moduli problem. A family of degree 0 line bundles parametrised by a &quot;k&quot;-variety &quot;T&quot; is defined to be a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on formula_20 such that
# for all &quot;t&quot; in &quot;T&quot;, the restriction of &quot;L&quot; to formula_21 is a degree 0 line bundle,
# the restriction of &quot;L&quot; to formula_22 is a trivial line bundle (here 0 is the identity of &quot;A&quot;).

Then there is a variety formula_19 and a family of degree 0 line bundles &quot;P&quot;, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by formula_19 such that a family &quot;L&quot; on &quot;T&quot; is associated a unique morphism formula_25 so that &quot;L&quot; is isomorphic to the pullback of &quot;P&quot; along the morphism formula_26. Applying this to the case when &quot;T&quot; is a point, we see that the points of formula_19 correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on &quot;A&quot;, so there is a natural group operation on formula_19 given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.

This association is a duality in the sense that it is contravariant functorial, i.e., it associates to all morphisms formula_29 dual morphisms formula_30 in a compatible way, and there is a natural isomorphism between the double dual formula_31 and formula_8 (defined via the Poincaré bundle). The &quot;n&quot;-torsion of an abelian variety and the &quot;n&quot;-torsion of its dual are dual to each other when &quot;n&quot; is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general — for all &quot;n&quot; — the &quot;n&quot;-torsion group schemes of dual abelian varieties are Cartier duals of each other. This generalises the Weil pairing for elliptic curves.

=== Polarisations ===

A polarisation of an abelian variety is an &quot;isogeny&quot; from an abelian variety to its dual that is symmetric with respect to &quot;double-duality&quot; for abelian varieties and for which the pullback of the Poincaré bundle along the associated graph morphism is ample (so it is analogous to a positive definite quadratic form). Polarised abelian varieties have finite automorphism groups. A principal polarisation is a polarisation that is an isomorphism. Jacobians of curves are naturally equipped with a principal polarisation as soon as one picks an arbitrary rational base point on the curve, and the curve can be reconstructed from its polarised Jacobian when the genus is formula_33. Not all principally polarised abelian varieties are Jacobians of curves; see the Schottky problem. A polarisation induces a Rosati involution on the endomorphism ring formula_34 of &quot;A&quot;.

=== Polarisations over the complex numbers ===
Over the complex numbers, a polarised abelian variety can be defined as an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; together with a choice of a Riemann form &quot;H&quot;. Two Riemann forms formula_35 and formula_36 are called equivalent if there are positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; such that formula_37. A choice of an equivalence class of Riemann forms on &quot;A&quot; is called a polarisation of &quot;A&quot;; over the complex number this is equivalent to the definition of polarisation given above. A morphism of polarised abelian varieties is a morphism formula_38 of abelian varieties such that the pullback of the Riemann form on &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot; is equivalent to the given form on &quot;A&quot;.

== Abelian scheme ==
One can also define abelian varieties scheme-theoretically and relative to a base. This allows for a uniform treatment of phenomena such as reduction mod &quot;p&quot; of abelian varieties (see Arithmetic of abelian varieties), and parameter-families of abelian varieties. An abelian scheme over a base scheme &quot;S&quot; of relative dimension &quot;g&quot; is a proper, smooth group scheme over &quot;S&quot; whose geometric fibers are connected and of dimension &quot;g&quot;. The fibers of an abelian scheme are abelian varieties, so one could think of an abelian scheme over S as being a family of abelian varieties parametrised by &quot;S&quot;.

For an abelian scheme formula_39, the group of &quot;n&quot;-torsion points forms a finite flat group scheme. The union of the formula_40-torsion points, for all &quot;n&quot;, forms a p-divisible group. Deformations of abelian schemes are, according to the Serre–Tate theorem, governed by the deformation properties of the associated &quot;p&quot;-divisible groups.

=== Example ===
Let formula_41 be such that formula_42 has no repeated complex roots. Then the discriminant formula_43 is nonzero. Let formula_44, so formula_45 is an open subscheme of formula_46. Then formula_47 is an abelian scheme over formula_45. It can be extended to a Néron model over formula_49, which is a smooth group scheme over formula_49, but the Néron model is not proper and hence is not an abelian scheme over formula_49.

=== Non-existence ===
 and Jean-Marc Fontaine independently proved that there are no nonzero abelian varieties over formula_52 with good reduction at all primes. Equivalently, there are no nonzero abelian schemes over formula_49. The proof involves showing that the coordinates of formula_40-torsion points generate number fields with very little ramification and hence of small discriminant, while, on the other hand, there are lower bounds on discriminants of number fields.

==Semiabelian variety==
A semiabelian variety is a commutative group variety which is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus.

<doc id="247156" wikidata="Q16147503" url="?curid=247156" title="Music of Dominica">
<text>The music of [[Dominica]] includes a variety of genres including all the popular genres of the world. Popular music is widespread, with a number of native Dominican performers gaining national fame in imported genres such as calypso, reggae, soca, kompa, zouk and rock and roll. Dominica&#x27;s own popular music industry has created a form called &quot;bouyon&quot;, which combines elements from several styles and has achieved a wide fanbase in Dominica. Groups include &quot;WCK&quot; (Windward Caribbean Kulture), Native musicians in various forms, such as reggae (Nasio Fontaine, Lazo, Brother Matthew Luke), kadans (Ophelia Marie, (Exile One, Grammacks) and calypso (The Wizzard), have also become stars at home and abroad.

There is also &quot;Cadence-lypso&quot;, the Dominica kadans, which has set the stage for some of the region&#x27;s most significant musical developments such as zouk and bouyon (another Dominican creation).

Like the other Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican folk music is a hybrid of African and European elements. The quadrille is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied by a kind of ensemble called a &quot;jing ping&quot; band. In addition, Dominica&#x27;s folk tradition includes folk songs called &quot;bélé&quot;, traditional storytelling called &quot;kont&quot;, masquerade, children&#x27;s and work songs, and Carnival music.

Until the late 1950s, the Afro-Dominican culture of most of the island was repressed by the colonial government and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, both of which taught that African-derived music was evil, demonic and uncultured. This perception changed in the mid- to late 20th century, when Afro-Dominican culture came to be celebrated through the work of promoters like Cissie Caudeiron.

== Characteristics ==
Dominica&#x27;s terrain is rugged, which has fostered distinct regional traditions. The northern, eastern, southern, western and central parts of the island are music areas. The villages of Wesley and Marigot are also unique in their preservation of English language and music rather than the more French-based styles of the rest of the island.

Dominican folk music is an oral tradition, learned informally through watching others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 years old or under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, as well as social factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.

Characteristics of Dominican music include the West African use of call and response singing, clapping as a major part of rhythm and lyrical, dance and rhythmic improvisation. Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French, and are traditionally sung by women (&quot;chantwèl&quot;), while the instrumental traditions are predominantly practiced by men. Drums, generically known as &quot;lapo kabwit&quot;, are the most prominent part of Dominica&#x27;s instrumental tradition.

== Folk music ==

Dominican folk music includes, most influentially, the French Antillean quadrille tradition, the &quot;jing ping&quot; style of dance music, as well as bélé and heel-and-toe polka. Traditional Carnival music includes chanté mas and lapo kabwit. Folk music on Dominica has historically been a part of everyday life, including work songs, religious music and secular, recreational music.

The quadrille is one of the most important dance of the Dominican folk tradition, which also includes the lancer and distinctive forms of several dances, many of them derived from European styles. The &quot;bidjin&quot; (biguine), &quot;mereng&quot; (méringue), &quot;sotis&quot; (schottische), &quot;polka pil&quot; (pure polka), &quot;vals o vyenn&quot; (Viennese waltz) and &quot;mazouk&quot; (mazurka) are particularly widespread.

=== Bélé ===

Bélé are folk songs of West African origin, traditionally performed recreationally in the evening during the full moon, and more rarely, &quot;lavèyé&quot; (wakes). The bélé tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, but is still performed for holidays like Easter, Independence Day, Christmas, Creole Day (Jounen Kwéyòl) and patron saint festivals held annually in the Parishes of Dominica, especially in the &quot;Fèt St.-Pierre&quot; and the &quot;Fèt St.-Isidore&quot; for fishermen and workers respectively.

All bélé are accompanied by an eponymous drum, the &quot;tanbou bélé&quot;, along with the &quot;tingting&quot; (triangle) and &quot;chakchak&quot; (maracas). Bélés start with a lead vocalist (&quot;chantwèl&quot;), who is followed by the responsorial chorus (&quot;lavwa&quot;), then a drummer and dancers.
Traditional dances revolve around stylized courtship between a male and female dancer, known as the &quot;kavalyé&quot; and &quot;danm&quot; respectively. The bélé song-dances include the &quot;bélé soté&quot;, &quot;bélé priòrité&quot;, &quot;bélé djouba&quot;, &quot;bélé contredanse&quot;, &quot;bélé rickety&quot; and &quot;bélé pitjé&quot;.

=== Quadrille ===

The quadrille is a dance form that is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, not just in Dominica, but also Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Francophone islands. Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets of couples in subscription picnics or dances, and in private parties. However, the quadrille tradition now only survives at holidays and festivals.

The Dominican quadrille generally has four figures, the &quot;pastouwèl&quot;, &quot;lapoul&quot;, &quot;lété&quot; and &quot;latrinitez&quot;. Some regions of Dominica, such as Petite Savanne, are home to local variants such as the &quot;caristo&quot;. Many quadrilles are found across Dominica under a wide variety of names. In addition to the standard quadrille, the lancer is also an important Dominican dance.

Accompaniment for the quadrille is provided by a four-instrument ensemble called a &quot;jing ping&quot; band.

===Jing ping===

Jing Ping is a kind of folk music originated on the slave plantations of Dominica, also known colloquially as an accordion band. In Dominican folk music, jing ping bands accompany a circle dance called the flirtation, as well as the Dominican quadrille.

Jing ping bands are made up of a &quot;boumboum&quot; (boom pipe), &quot;syak&quot; or &quot;gwaj&quot; (scraper-rattle), &quot;tambal&quot; or &quot;tanbou&quot; (tambourine) and accordion. The double bass and banjo are also sometimes used. Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when accordions were introduced. The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in serenades, until being revived after the National Independence Competitions.

===Chanté mas===

The chanté mas (masquerade song) tradition is based around pre-calypso Carnival music performed in a responsorial style by partygoers. The Dominican Carnival masquerade lasted for two days of parading through the streets, with a singer dancing backwards in front of the drummer on a &quot;tanbou lélé&quot;. Chanté mas lyrics are traditionally based on gossip and scandal, and addressed the personal shortcomings of others.

=== Other folk music ===
Dominica&#x27;s folk musical heritage includes work songs, storytelling, children&#x27;s music and masquerade songs. Dominican work songs are accompanied by the &quot;tambou twavay&quot; drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.

The kont, or storytelling, folk tradition of Dominica was focused around entertainment for night-time festivals, funeral wakes and feasts and festivals. Modern &quot;kont&quot; is mostly performed during major festival competitions. Most &quot;kont&quot; storytellers work with local traditions, such as legends and history, and provide an ethical or moral message. A one line theme song, often based around a duet between two characters, recurs throughout most &quot;kont&quot; performances.

Unlike most Dominican folk songs, children&#x27;s songs and musical games are mostly in English. They were originally in the same Creole as the rest of the island, but have come to be primarily of English, Scottish, and Irish derivation. Children&#x27;s musical traditions include ring games and circle dances, and music accompanied by thigh-slapping and circle dancing.

== Early popular music ==
Dominican popular music history can be traced back to the 1940s and &#x27;50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.

By the beginning of the 1960s, calypso and Trinidadian steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like chanté mas and lapo kabwit. Early recording stars from this era included Swinging Busters, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem and Los Caballeros, while chorale groups also gained fans, especially Lajenne Etwal, Siflé Montan&#x27;y and the Dominica Folk singers. These early popular musicians were aided by the spread of radio broadcasting, beginning with WIDBS and later Radio Dominica.

Of these early popular musicians, a few pioneering the use of native influences. The Gaylords’ hits, such as &quot;Ti Mako&quot;, &quot;Pray for the Blackman&quot;, &quot;Lovely Dominica&quot; and &quot;Douvan Jo&quot;, were either English or the native Creole, (&quot;kwéyòl&quot;). By the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s, American rock and roll, soul and funk had reached Dominica and left lasting influences. Funky rock-based bands like Voltage Four, Woodenstool and Every Mother&#x27;s Child became popular.

The first internationally known bands from Dominica were 1970s groups such as Exile One and Grammacks. These bands were the stars of the cadence-lypso scene, which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the 1980s, however, Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, playing an experimental fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.

===Calypso===

In the 1960s, calypso and steelband music became very popular and indeed replaced lapo kabwit and chanté mas as the music of carnival, particularly in the capital Roseau. Many of the traditional songs were performed in the new calypso beat. Calypsonians and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. Steelbands emerged all around the country. The older musicians and bands had moved on and were replaced by the younger musicians. Bands such as Swinging Stars, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem, Los Caballeros and Swinging Busters surfaced and began to cut records. The emergence of radio, first WIDBS and later Radio Dominica helped to spread the music.

Calypso has been popular in Dominica since the 1950s; the first Calypso King was crowned in 1959. Popular calypso in Dominica has always been closely associated with steelpan music. The first wave of Dominican steelpan includes such bands as Esso, Shell and Regent, Vauxhall and Old Oak.

===Cadence (kadans)/compas===

In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. This was followed by mini-jazz like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, Les Vikings de Guadeloupe and others.

Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson&#x27;s Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav&#x27; invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs including &quot;Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni&quot;. Kassav&#x27; formed in Paris in 1978.

===Cadence-lypso===

The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of Haiti and calypso music from the English-speaking Caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.

Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock and roll, soul, and funk music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as &quot;a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary&quot;.

Aside from Exile One, other bands included the Grammacks, Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau and Anthony Gussie. Ophelia Marie is a popular singer of cadence-lypso in the 1980s.

Cadence-lypso was influenced by nationalist movement that espoused Rastafari and Black Power. Many groups performed songs with intensely ideological positions, and much of the repertoire was in the vernacular Creole language.
Gordon Henderson, Exile One&#x27;s leader and founder, coined the name &quot;Cadence-lypso&quot; in his full band that used a full-horn section and was the first to use the synthesizers in kadans. Many mini-jazz from Haiti and the French Antilles followed this format. The band is considered by some to be one of the pioneers of soca. During the early 1970s, they initiated a fusion of cadence and calypso &quot;Cadence-lypso&quot; that would later become soca music.

Exile One was the most promoted Creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records. The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands.

== Recent popular music ==
During the 1980s, cadence-lypso’s popularity declined greatly. Some Dominican performers remained famous, such as Ophelia, a very renowned singer of the period. Popular music during this time was mostly zouk, a style pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav, who used styles of folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe. Soca, a kind of Trinidadian music, was also popular at the time, producing bands like Windward Caribbean Kulture. The &#x27;80s also saw a rise in popular for jazz and the formation of several jazz bands, while groups like Exile One began exploring tradition rhythms from &quot;jing ping&quot; and &quot;lapo kabwit&quot;.

===Zouk===

The inspiration for Zouk&#x27;s style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso – Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk is based around star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and is based almost entirely around studio recordings.

Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk&#x27;s development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican bèlè (&quot;tambour&quot; and &quot;ti bwa&quot;)
folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence, Guadeloupean &quot;biguine&quot;. Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres.

===Zouk-love===
Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems.

The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie of Dominica. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.
Grammacks, Exile One, Ophelia Marie, and many Dominican bands played cadence-lypso (Dominica Kadans) that later influenced zouk love in the French Antilles. Nowadays, zouk-love is called the French Antilles cadence or compas. Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands-based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha.

===Soca===
The calypsonian Lord Shorty of Trinidad was the first to define his music as &quot;soca&quot; during 1975 when his hit song “Endless Vibrations” was causing major musical waves on radio stations and at parties and clubs not just throughout his native T&amp;T but also in far off metropolitan cities like New York, Toronto and London. Soca was originally spelled Sokah which stands for the “Soul of Calypso” with the “kah” part being taken from the first letter in the Sanskrit alphabet and representing the Power of movement as well as the East Indian rhythmic influence that helped to inspire the new soca beat. Shorty stated in a number of interviews that the idea for the new soca beat started with the rhythmic fusion of Calypso rhythms with East Indian rhythms that he used in his hit &quot;Indrani&quot; recorded in 1972. The soca beat was solidified as the popular new beat that most of the T&amp;T Calypso musicians would start adopting by the time Shorty had recorded his big crossover hit “Endless Vibrations” in 1974.

Shorty also recorded a mid-year album in 1975 called “Love In The Caribbean” that contains a number of crossover soca tracks before setting off on an album distribution and promotion tour. During his 1975 “Love In The Caribbean” album promotion and distribution tour Shorty pass thru the isle of Dominica on his way back to Trinidad and saw Dominica&#x27;s top band Exile One perform at the Fort Young Hotel. Shorty was inspired to compose and record a Soca and Cadence-lypso fusion track called “E Pete” or “Ou Petit” which can be viewed as the first of its kind in that particular Soca style. Shorty sought and got help with the Creole lyrics he used in the chorus of his “E Pete” song by consulting with Dominica&#x27;s 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo, and two creole lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron while he was in Dominica. The song “E Pete” thus contains genuine Creole lyrics in the chorus like &quot;Ou dee moin ou petit Shorty&quot; (meaning &quot;you told me you are small Shorty&quot;), and is a combination of Soca, Calypso, Cadence-lypso and Creole.

Shorty&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Soul of Calypso&quot; brought Soca to regional and international attention and fame and helped to solidify the rapidly growing Soca Movement led by Shorty.

Soca developed in the early 1970s and grew in popularity in the late 1970s. Soca&#x27;s development as a musical genre included its early fusion of calypso with Indian musical instruments, particularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal, as demonstrated in Lord Shorty&#x27;s classic compositions &quot;Ïndrani&quot;, &quot;Kalo Gee Bull Bull&quot; and &quot;Shanti Om&quot;.

===Bouyon===

Bouyon is a fusion of Jing ping, Cadence-lypso and traditional dances namely bèlè, Quadrille, chanté mas and lapo kabwit, Mazurka, Zouk and other styles of Caribbean music, developed by a band called &quot;Windward Caribbean Kulture&quot; (later &quot;WCK&quot;).
WCK was among the most prominent of &#x27;80s Dominican soca bands. They began using native drum rhythms such as lapo kabwit and elements of the music of jing ping bands, as well as ragga-style vocals. Bouyon is popular across the Caribbean, and is known as &quot;jump up music&quot; in Guadeloupe and Martinique.

The best-known band in the genre was Windward Caribbean Kulture &quot;WCK&quot; in 1988 by experimenting a fusion of Jing Ping and Cadence-lypso. While the Cadence-lypso sound is based on the creative usage of acoustic drums, an aggressive up-tempo guitar beat, and strong social commentary in the local Creole language, this new music created by the &quot;WCK&quot; band focused more on the use of modern technology with strong emphasis on keyboard rhythmic patterns.

Bouyon has diversified into multiple subgenres. These include bouyon soca, bouyon-muffin, reketeng, and bouyon gwada.

===Bouyon soca===

Bouyon soca, sometimes referred to as Jump up soca, is a fusion genre that typically blends old bouyon rhythms from the &#x27;90s and soca music. Bouyon soca is a term coined by non-Dominican producers and musicians, mainly from St Lucia, who embrace both Soca from Trinidad and Bouyon music from Dominica and so find it natural to produce blends of both music genres. Bouyon is a music genre that originated in Dominica that is distinguishable from its older &quot;colleague&quot; Soca.

In Dominica while there may have been the occasional fusions, bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognizable and different style from soca. Outside of Dominica the Bouyon Soca fusion style is popular in islands like Antigua, Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique and is a natural evolution from Zouk and Soca fusions that were popular there during the 1980s.

==Alternative music==
Religious music, influenced by American gospel, has become an important part of Dominican popular music in the 1990s. Calypso has also retained much popularity in Dominica, as has Jazz. The band Impact has fused jazz with Caribbean music. Other styles include steelpan, which has declined popularity despite the efforts of groups like Dancehall.

== Music institutions and festivals ==
The Caribbean Carnival is an important part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (&quot;chanté mas&quot;) and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, &quot;Mas Domnik&quot;, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of &quot;chanté mas&quot;, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican &quot;Mas Domnik&quot; music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.

The World Creole Music Festival takes place on the island of Dominica, in Festival City, Roseau, which is run by the governmental Dominica Festivals Commission. The National Independence Competitions are an important part of Dominican musical culture. They were founded by Chief Minister of Dominica Edward Olivier Leblanc in 1965, and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica. The government of Dominica also promotes Dominican music through the Dominican Broadcasting Station, which broadcasts between 20% and 25% local music as a matter of policy.

<text>Marina Beach, or simply the Marina, is a natural urban beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal. The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, a distance of , making it the second longest urban beach in the world, after Cox&#x27;s Bazar Beach. It is a prominent landmark in Chennai.


The Marina is a primarily sandy beach, with an average width of and the width at the widest stretch is . Bathing and swimming at the Marina are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country and attracts about 30,000 visitors a day during weekdays and 50,000 visitors a day during the weekends and on holidays. During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 people visit the beach daily.

==History==

Before the 16th century, there were frequent incident of inundation of land near the coast due to rise in sea level. When the sea withdrew, several ridges and lagoons were left behind. On the southern side of Fort St. George, one such sand ridge ran from the mouth of the Cooum River to the present site of the Presidency College. On the rear side of the ridge was a huge depression on which the college grounds were later developed. The ridge is the site of the present-day beach. When Fort St. George was built in 1640, the sea was too close to the fort. The building of the harbor near the fort resulted in sand accretion to the south of the fort and the harbor and the sea, which was washing the ramparts of the fort, moved afar at about 2.5 km away from the fort creating a wide beach between the land and the sea.

Before the Madras harbor was built, the beach was just a strip of mud, teeming with mudskippers. The beach washed up close to the present day road for a long time until the harbor was built in 1881. Mount Stuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, the governor of Madras from 1881 to 1886, who was captivated by the beach on an earlier visit to the city in the late 1870s, conceived and built the promenade along the beach in 1884 by extensively modifying and layering with soft sand. He also gave it the name &quot;Madras Marina&quot; in the same year. Since the early 19th century, a number of public buildings were constructed fronting the beach.

Ever since the harbor was built, the area south of the port has accreted significantly, forming the present day&#x27;s beach mainly due to the presence of wave breakers laid for the construction of the harbor, although the coast in the northern region has undergone severe erosion. Eventually, the north-drifting current widened the beach to its present extent. The beach was formed as a result of arresting the littoral drift by the port&#x27;s breakwater. The area of the beach is increasing 40 sq m every year due to progradation.


Since the creation of the promenade in 1884, there were several additions along the stretch. The country&#x27;s first aquarium was established as one of the first additions in 1909. Shortly after the Independence, the Triumph of Labour statue and the Gandhi statue in &#x27;march to Dandi&#x27; stride, which has been duplicated on the lawns of the Parliament House, were erected on the beach. In 1968, a number of statues of icons of Tamil literature was erected to mark the first World Tamil Conference, including Avvaiyar, Tiruvalluvar, Kambar, Subramania Bharathiyar, Bharathidasan, the Dravidologist Caldwell, G. U. Pope and Veeramamunivar. Anna memorial was built in 1970 and the M.G.R. and Amma Memorial in 1988, shortening the stretch at its northern end. Later addition was a statue for Kamaraj. In December 2016, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa was also buried here, inside the M.G.R. Memorial campus and a foundation stone for construction of a memorial for her there has been laid. On 8 August 2018, former chief minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi was buried beside his mentor Annadurai at the Marina Beach.

==Ecology==
===Environment===

The Marina beach was famed for its pristine beauty, jolly ambiance, and rich ecosystems. However, since the middle of the 20th century, the beach and water have become polluted. Proliferation of plastic bags, human waste, and other pollutants have rendered many parts of the beach unusable. In recent years, many voluntary organizations have taken up the task of cleaning up the Marina and protecting the ecosystem. Particular efforts include protection of olive ridley turtle nests along the Neelankarai section of the beach.

===Flora and fauna===
Marina Beach lies on the stretch of coast where olive ridley sea turtles, a species classified as Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (critically endangered), nest during mating season, chiefly between late October and April peaking from mid-January to mid-February. The Ennore–Mamallapuram zone, on which the beach lies, is one of the three major nesting grounds on the Indian coast. However, with the expansion of the shrimp trawling fishery in the eastern coast of India in the mid-1970s, several individuals of the species are washed ashore dead every year. The eggs laid by the females along the beach are also sold in the local market by the fishermen and traders. In 1977, a recovery program was started by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Many volunteer organizations in the city, such as the Students&#x27; Sea Turtle Conservation Network and the Sea Turtle Protection Force of the TREE Foundation, get involved in conservation of the species along the coast.

Meiofaunal composition at the Marina Beach chiefly includes turbellarians, nematodes, polychaetes, oligochaetes, and harpacticoids. Species of gastrotrichs are also found in the region.

Common fishes found along the beach include mullets, sharks, silver bellies, rays, ribbon fish, skates, whitebait, dussumieria, Jew fish, horse mackerel, crabs, seer, pellona, pomfret, perches, lactarius, lethrinus, flying fish, engraulis, sardines, lobsters, sabre fish, barracuda, hilsa, tunny fish, Indian salmon, leather jackets, cookup, breams, catfish, snappers, synagris, bonito, soles, polynemus, and prawns, among others.

==Dimensions and characteristics==
The Marina is a natural urban sandy beach along the Coramandel coast on the Bay of Bengal. Primarily sandy, the beach spans about , running from near Fort St. George in the north to Besant Nagar in the south and is the longest natural urban beach in India. The average width of the beach is and the width at the widest stretch is .

==Infrastructure and activities==

Marina beach is a major tourist attraction of the city. It is also the main place for the local people to escape from the summer heat. The beach is popular for its shops and food stalls run by about 500 shops run by about 1,212 vendors. The memorials and statues, morning walk, joggers&#x27; track, lovers&#x27; spot, aquarium, and the like make it a hangout for people of all ages. Kite flying and beach cricket are common sports at the beach, and there are also facilities for pony rides. Beach cricket at the Marina dates back several decades. However, Chennai City Police has banned it at different points due to its interference with traffic and beach walkers. The sea is generally rough and waves are strong. There are fishermen colonies present at both ends of the beach. There are also joyrides, merry-go-rounds and mini giant wheels along the stretch, although they are installed without permission from any government agency.

There are two swimming pools along the stretch—the Marina swimming pool and the Anna swimming pool. The Marina swimming pool was built in 1947 and is located on a 1.5-acre compound opposite the Presidency College. The pool is 100 m long and 34 m wide, bigger than the standard Olympic pool size of 50 m × 25 m and is deep. The shallow end is 3.5 feet deep. It is maintained by Corporation of Chennai. It underwent renovation in 1994, 2004, and 2009 (at 7 million). On an average, the swimming pool receives 1,500 people. During the summer months of April and May, the footfall is goes up to 2,500 people. The pool can accommodate around 400 people at any given time and has 10 cloak rooms. As of 2018, there were 30 staff in the pool and six surveillance cameras. The Anna swimming pool is located opposite the clock tower building of the University of Madras and virtually remains hidden behind the Anna Square bus terminus. The pool is said to be the first Olympic size pool to be built in Tamil Nadu. It was constructed in 1976 with a diving board. However, the diving board was removed later during a renovation. The pool is deep. It also has a toddler pool that is . Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) conducts regular coaching camps at the pool.

The oval-shaped skating arena at the beach has an outer railing and standing area for people to watch from.

As part of the &#x27;Chennai Forever&#x27; initiative by the Tamil Nadu government, a tall, artificial waterfall was installed in September 2005 at a cost of 1.5 million. A visitor center near the Cooum River mouth on the Marina, similar to the Marina Barrage Visitor Centre in Singapore and San Antonio Visitor Center in the United States, has been planned as part of an initiative to create awareness of the need for clean waterways.

In 2008, two floating fountains with spray height of 100 feet with color lights for night view were planned to be installed in sea waters off the beach.
In 2010, the Chennai Corporation procured new cleaning equipment to clean the beach at a cost of 8.011 million. These included a sand-cleaning machine capable of cleaning 15,000 m2 area in an hour procured at a cost of 3.267 million, three skid steer loaders to clean narrow lanes commissioned at a cost of 2.652 million, imported lawn mower, ride-on mechanical sweeper, tree pruner and hedge trimmer. An automatic ticket-vending machine at a cost of 170,000 was also commissioned at the Marina swimming pool for managing the crowd. The corporation also planned to construct two more public conveniences at the beach. About 150 corporation staff, including a junior engineer, maintains the lawns and service lanes on the beach.

As of 2013, the 3.1-km stretch of the beach from the Triumph of Labor statue to the lighthouse has 31 high-mast lamps.

According to police statistics, about 5,000 people use the 2-km-long Loop Road daily for their morning walk.

As of 2017, there were 1,544 vendors on the beach, which increased to 1,962 by 2019. In 2019, the Corporation decided to restrict the licensed vendors to 900. There are toilets at six locations across the stretch and about 175 sanitary workers deployed at the beach on shift basis.

The beach had facility to park 2,271 two-wheelers, 457 cars, and 80 vans and buses.

==Structures along the beach==
Being the city&#x27;s primary area for recreation, the entire stretch features numerous statues and monuments that have come up over the years along the beach promenade, called Kamaraj Salai. While the beach stretches along the eastern side of the road, the western side is dotted with various governmental institutions and historic and stately buildings from the British rule all along its length. Victory War Memorial, a memorial for the warriors who lost their lives in the World Wars, marks the northern end of the beach. Memorials for C. N. Annadurai, M. G. Ramachandran, J. Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi, former chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, are present on the northern end of the promenade known as the &quot;Anna Square&quot;. As of May 2018, a Lilliputian Children&#x27;s Traffic Park was under construction near the Anna Memorial adjacent to the Anna Swimming Pool at a cost of 20.7 million. The traffic park measures 4,140 square meters, with facilities such as a viewing gallery, walking track, children&#x27;s play area, traffic sign boards, and a riding track.

All along the length of the promenade, stone statues adorn the roadside area of the beach starting from the Triumph of Labour statue, the first statue erected in the beach, near the memorials at the Anna Square to Mahatma Gandhi statue near the lighthouse. Most statues are of national or local legends while others have symbolic significance like the Triumph of Labour statue. The statues along the promenade are (from north to south):
* Robert Caldwell (erected on 2 January 1968)
* Kambar (erected on 2 January 1968)
* Ilango Adigal (erected on 7 November 1971)
* Triumph of Labor (erected on 25 January 1959)
* Bharathiyar (erected on 2 January 1968)
* Kannagi statue (erected on 2 January 1968/re-erected on 3 June 2006)
* Subhas Chandra Bose (erected on 15 December 1997)
* Thiruvalluvar (erected on 2 January 1968)
* George Uglow Pope (erected on 2 January 1968)
* Annie Besant
* Bharathidasan (erected on 2 January 1968)

Earlier present near Gandhi statue traffic island was a statue for Sivaji Ganesan, which was erected on 21 July 2006. Following a court order, it was shifted on 3 August 2017 to a newly built memorial at Adyar.
The other side of the road houses several historical buildings and institutions including the Chepauk Cricket Stadium, the University of Madras, the Presidency College, Vivekananda House, Queen Mary&#x27;s College, Inspector General of Police Headquarters, All India Radio—Chennai, Dr. Annie Besant Park.

==Renovation==

In February 2008, the Chennai Corporation, previously known as &quot;The Madras Corporation&quot;, took up the Marina Renovation Project with improved landscaping, seating arrangements, walkways, and lighting along the promenade, and architectural elements such as plazas, gazeboes, and pergolas were installed all along the stretch including 4 m-wide non-slippery granite footpaths near the service lane, another 5 m-wide footpath, and 15 m-wide lawns. The blueprint of the renovation project included ornamental fountains, exclusive parking lots for two- and four-wheelers, a children&#x27;s play area, bus shelters, ramps for physically challenged, and food courts. The whole length of the stretch from Triumph of Labor Statue to the Lighthouse measuring 3.1 km has been divided into 14 harmonious landscaped galleries dotting its span, each with an element of drama attached to the design in the form of small theatre-type galleries where visitors can sit.

All the 14 sections vary significantly from one another and were designed in such a way as to the differentiation of sections not leading to any break in the walkway, which is a continuous walking stretch from the Triumph of Labor Statue to the Kamaraj Statue. One of these galleries is flanked by two semi-circular stainless-steel pergolas resting on wire-cut brick columns. The galleries can accommodate over 1,000 people. The choice of natural stones and pillars used in each section of the promenade was based on the type of the buildings on the other side of the road. The walkway was designed as low-lying as is necessary to have a clear view of the beach from the road. A total of 428 octagonal poles with seagull-shaped light fittings and additional high-mast lamps have been erected.

Ten modern stainless steel bus shelters have been erected near the beach. There is a skating rink behind the Gandhi Statue which has been improved with hand rails and tiles on the periphery under the project. A total of 14 galleries with seating arrangements and a 4-m internal walkway along the sands and fountains have been created on the stretch from the Anna Square to the Lighthouse. This stretch has uninterrupted pavement and a sub-road parallel to the main road. Five reverse osmosis plants capable of providing 30,000 liters of drinking water an hour free of cost to visitors is under construction. As part of the beautification project, the decade-old 250-watt lamps were replaced with 690 anti-corrosive lamps along Kamaraj Salai and the service road. The renovation was completed in December 2009 at a cost of 259.2 million. Although initially the corporation planned to outsource security personnel to protect the renovated structures, the plan was dropped and about 50 corporation staff were employed to man the stretch.

In 2009, a 4.5-km-long stretch along the beach was announced plastic-free zone, prohibiting the sale and use of plastic. In November 2010, the corporation imposed a fine of 100 on the usage of plastic items that are less than 20 μm thick on the entire stretch. Within a couple of years since the ban, the use of plastics on the beach was reduced by 70 percent.

In 2012, the government allotted 89 million for the renovation of the memorials of Anna and M.G.R. This include 12 million and 43 million towards renovation of Anna Memorial and M.G.R. and Amma Memorial, respectively, 34 million towards additional construction at the M.G.R. and Amma Memorial.

In 2012, the corporation allotted 48.4 million for installing two high-mast lamps, a police watchtower, and a giant chess board and an interactive fountain in the children&#x27;s play area. This also includes relocation of the shops to specific locations on the sand at a cost of 41.2 million.

In 2017, plans to revamp the beach under the Swadesh Darshan scheme of the Indian government at a cost of 500 million have been drawn.

==Safety measures and policing==
The Marina continues to remain the most dangerous place to bathe or swim, recording the highest number of drownings in the state of Tamil Nadu. Bathing and swimming are illegal at Marina beach since the undercurrent in the region is very strong, and there are no lifeguards stationed here. As many people throng the beach, quite often there are drowning mishaps. An estimated five sea-bathers are drowned every month at the beach, and most of the swimmers are dragged by the tides into the debris of a tramp ship &quot;SS Damatis&quot; that sank off the beach during a cyclone in 1966. Police personnel and lifeguards constantly patrol the whole area, which is divided into seventy-two sections, by means of horses and all-terrain vehicles (known as &quot;beach buggies&quot;). Five spots off the beach, including near the Anna Square, Kannagi Statue, Triumph of Labor Statue and behind Vivekananda House, have been identified by the police as extremely unsafe due to the presence of whirlpools and rock projections in the seabed. In 2010, 75 people drowned in the sea along the 5-km stretch of the beach. Of this, the 1-km stretch from Anna Square to the Anna swimming pool is considered the most dangerous with as many as 29 persons drowning in the sea in 2010. The deep sea in this stretch is considered to still hold parts of the smacked ship. In 2011, in addition to the tie-up with Coast Guard security personnel, the city police planned for a tie-up with the fire and rescue services department to provide a stand-by rescue team at the beach to save people from drowning. The rescue team, equipped with a rubber boat and a motor-fitted boat, was planned to be stationed at the Anna Square police station or the Marina police station.
The law-enforcing agencies is planning to bring the beach under close watch by means of two watchtowers and at least a dozen surveillance cameras. The Chennai Corporation has agreed in principle to create the security infrastructure based on a proposal sent by the Greater Chennai Police. The watchtowers are proposed to be erected behind the Triumph of Labour statue and the Gandhi statue. In August 2012, the government sanctioned six more all-terrain vehicles for patrolling the beach.

In December 2012, in a measure to regulate parking and to control the entry of vehicles into the beach, the Chennai Corporation decided to install drop gates at seven entry points on the beach&#x27;s service lane, including near the PWD Building, Subash Chandra Bose statue, Dr. Annie Besant statue, Vivekanandar Illam, Avvaiyar statue, Veeramamunivar statue and the lighthouse.

Despite intensive patrolling, illegal bike races and night races are also held along the stretch, resulting in public nuisances and, at times, death of the racers.

==Controversies==

With a length of 13 km, including a 6 km promenade, the Marina is considered the world&#x27;s second longest urban beach, although there exist in fact several longer beaches, including Praia do Cassino (254 km) in Brazil, Cox&#x27;s Bazar (120 km) in Bangladesh, Padre Island on the U.S. Gulf Coast, Ninety Mile Beach in Australia and Ninety Mile Beach (88 km) in New Zealand. However, unlike most beaches, Marina is a natural sandy urban beach similar to the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, helping it earn the title.

In December 2001, the Kannagi statue, which was erected in 1968 on the occasion of a World Tamil Conference held in Chennai, was removed for traffic maintenance reason as part of modernization of the beach, which led to a huge protest and demonstration by the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party. When the DMK later came to power, the statue was installed in the same place on 3 June 2006 by the DMK party chief M. Karunanidhi.

On 9 August 2003, an open-air stage located 350 ft from the sea on the sands of the Marina called &quot;Seerani Arangam&quot;, constructed in 1970, which was used by religious groups and political parties to address gatherings, was demolished by the state government (ADMK) in order to modernise the beach. This spot was a place where rallies were held for the freedom movement during the British Raj, and the stage was considered a symbol of the historical events that had taken place in the Marina. This created a great controversy.

==Incidents==
In 1966, a tramp ship &quot;SS Damatis&quot; sank near the Marina due to a cyclone in the region.
The beachfront was severely damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The tsunami waves, caused due to an &quot;M&quot; 9.2 magnitude earthquake at about 257 km south-southeast of Banda Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia, on the Indian Ocean floor on 26 December 2004 at 6.20 am IST, struck the beach, which is about 2028 km North West from the epicentre, at 8.40 am IST. The reported height of the tsunami waves at the beach was 6 m which washed away about 206 persons on the beach, most of whom were morning joggers and children playing cricket on the beach, including a few tourists. With the assistance of the World Bank, the government built 2,000 temporary Marina beach shelters each measuring about 250 sq.ft. to house families affected by the tsunami at a cost of 172.3 million. However, in 2012, new houses for residents of tenements on the Marina Beach was planned to be taken up under a Disaster Preparedness Project of the state government.
As a visible change in the beach immediately after the tsunami, the intertidal area was much flatter on 27 December 2004, which usually featured a gentle slope. However, the usual slope started to appear 4 days after the tsunami and normal profile was restored in about 15 days. The receding wave after the tsunami lasted for more than 24 h. Post tsunami, there was a distinct variation in the distribution of sand grains in the beach until the 4th day. However, from the 5th day after the tsunami, normal composition of sand grains appeared to have been restored at different depths. The tsunami also resulted in various geomorphological changes in the region such as those in the contour of the 2,000 km-long Burma Plate, which sits atop the India plate, resulting in a rise in the land level of Chennai, ranging between 0.5 cm and 3 cm.

Following the tsunami, there was a distinct increase in the meiofaunal density in the beach. Various meiofauna found in the beach after tsunami include foraminiferans (&quot;Elphidium&quot; sp.), cnidarians (&quot;Halammohydra&quot; sp., &quot;Psammohydra&quot; sp.), turbellarians (&quot;Otoplana&quot; sp., &quot;Macrostomum&quot; sp.), nemertines, nematodes (&quot;Halalaimus setosus&quot;, &quot;Desmodora&quot; sp., &quot;Chromadora&quot; sp., &quot;Sabatieria&quot; sp., &quot;Steineria&quot; sp., &quot;Metapselionema&quot; sp.), gastrotrichs (&quot;Chaetonotus&quot; sp., &quot;Thaumastoderma&quot; sp.), rotifers, kinorhynchs (&quot;Cateria&quot; sp.), polychaetes (&quot;Hesionides&quot; sp.), archiannelids (&quot;Polygordius madrasensis&quot;, &quot;Saccocirrus minor&quot;), oligochaetes (&quot;Marionina&quot; sp.), harpacticiod copepods (&quot;Arenosetella indica&quot;, &quot;Psammastacus acuticaudatus&quot;, &quot;Leptastacus euryhalinus&quot;, &quot;Emertonia minuta&quot;, &quot;Sewellina reductus&quot;), ostracods (&quot;Polycope&quot; sp.), isopods (&quot;Angeliera phreaticola&quot;), halacarids (&quot;Halacarus&quot; sp.), insects, and various other species.

Marina Beach was also the venue of the 2017 pro-Jallikattu protests. The mass gathering of more than a million people in protest of the ban on the traditional bull-fighting sport Jallikattu at the Marina beach in Chennai for 10 consecutive days turned several eyes on the city&#x27;s beach from across the nation. The leader-less movement grew much bigger as protests began in other cities across the country and later by Tamils in 15 countries including United States of America, UK, China, Japan and Singapore. The protest came to end only after the ban was revoked after the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 was amended by the state government to allow the sport.

== Events ==

Being the most prominent open space in the city, the Marina Beach hosts several events throughout the year. The annual Independence Day and the Republic Day ceremonial parades and airshows are held along the promenade along with the unfurling of the national flag in the Marina. The annual idol-immersion event following the Hindu festival of Vinayaka Chathurthi takes place at the beach where most of the idols of Lord Ganesh kept on display during the festival in the city is immersed into the sea. The event occurs in the month of August–September. The beach is also the venue for several marathon and walkathon campaigns throughout the year conducted for various cause.

The beach receives the maximum number of visitors on the Kannum Pongal day, a day in the festival season of Pongal in mid-January, when about 150,000 people come to the beach.

The annual Chennai Marathon managed by Chennai Runners is held in the beach starting from the Anna Square to Annai Velankanni Church on the Elliot&#x27;s Beach in Besant Nagar. It is India&#x27;s biggest city marathon and is also said to be South India&#x27;s richest marathon, in which over 1,000 athletes and more than 20,000 people participate, which includes various categories such as a 21-km run for professional athletes, a city run for everybody, a junior run for children, a master&#x27;s run for senior citizens and a wheelchair run for the disabled.

From 2016, the Marina Runner Marathon managed by Marina Runner Running Group is held every year in the last weekend of February, this event prides itself on promoting running along Marina Beach, the second longest Urban beach in the world.

In 2008, the beach played host to India&#x27;s first International Beach Volleyball Championship, &quot;BSNL FIVB Chennai Challenger:2008&quot;, from 15 to 20 July to popularize beach volleyball. The event was organized by the Beach Volleyball Club and was sponsored by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Eleven Indian teams along with 60 teams from 21 countries participated in the 6-day-long tournament offering a total prize money of US$40,000 in the men&#x27;s and US$6,400 in the women&#x27;s events.

In March 2016, &quot;My leader&quot; campaign was launched in this historical place. The main focus of this event was to attract youngsters to take up politics.

From 2014, Tsunami and Anti-terrorism Drills have been conducted at the beach by Survival Instincts jointly with Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Tamil Nadu Disaster Management Authority, and Tamil Nadu Police Coastal Security Group.

==Transportation==

Kamaraj Salai, a six-lane road and one of the arterial roads of Chennai City, runs alongside the beach providing a sea view starting from the Victory War Memorial near the Cooum River delta till the lighthouse to the south. The road extends further south beyond the lighthouse where it is known as the &#x27;Santhome High Road&#x27;, running away from the sea but parallel to the beach until Santhome. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation has a terminus called the &#x27;Anna Square&#x27; terminus at the northern end of the beach, Triplicane Terminus near Kannagi statue/Pycrofts Road, Vivekananda House (Ice House) Terminus and Foreshore Estate terminus. Railway stations alongside the beach include the Chepauk, the Tiruvallikeni and the Lighthouse MRTS railway stations. The Poonamallee–Lighthouse (Line 4) section of the Chennai Metro (Phase II) under construction will connect the beach with other parts of the city.

There was a plan to build a 9.7-km elevated road along the beach connecting the lighthouse with the East Coast Road in the south at a cost of 10,000 million. However, the plan was dropped due to opposition from the public such as the &#x27;Save Chennai Beaches&#x27; campaign.

==Legacy==

Although the beach promenade was created in 1884, the sandy shore has been mentioned in the literature much earlier. The beach shore has a mentioning in the verse no. 2297 of the 4000 Divya Prabandham written by Peyalwar. The verse, dating back to 7th century CE, was written in Tamil, and it says that the sea was so rich with white waves bringing to the shore very precious gems like red corals and white pearls and that the light of the dusk (moonlight) falls on these gems at the shore and makes the area brightened with beautiful colors.

Grant Duff, the governor of Madras who developed the beach promenade, recalls in his memoirs:

Grant Duff christened it the &quot;Madras Marina&quot; in 1884, the same year when the beach promenade was created, on which he explains in a letter:

In &quot;New India&quot;, the newspaper that was run by Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist and Home Rule advocate, the beauty of Marina Beach was described back in 1914. On 6 October 1914, Anne Besant wrote,

==Future developments==
In January 2014, the corporation announced a makeover of the 2.8-km stretch on the southern part of the beach from Lighthouse to Foreshore Estate, including development of walkways, benches, a gallery, bicycle tracks, concrete roads, service trenches, rainwater trenches and streetlight fittings at an estimated cost of 400 million. The development would provide alternative accommodation to vendors of the existing market on the Marina Loop Road by commissioning of a modern fish market on the stretch. The loop road connecting the Lighthouse and Foreshore Estate, which is currently a 20-metre-wide road, will be converted to a four-lane concrete road barricaded on both sides with stainless steel pillared railings and will pass all along the Santhome coast of the Marina Beach. A 2.4-metre-wide bicycle track, a 3.3-metre-wide walkway and a 2.5-metre-wide gallery will be developed on the eastern side of the road. The western side of the road will have a fish market with cold storage facilities as well as a walkway.

The corporation also plans to develop more than 300 heritage pillars, each 1.2 meters tall, on the western side of Kamaraj Salai opposite the beach. The uniformly designed heritage pillars will be made of granite and iron on the stretch from All India Radio to Swami Sivananda Salai. The pillars would replace the existing walls of various institutions to improve aesthetics around the beach. In 2018, the Corporation revealed plans to make the beach disabled-friendly.

As of 2019, the Greater Chennai Corporation was exploring the feasibility of conducting water sports on the Marina beach.

==In popular culture==
Marina Beach has been featured in numerous Tamil movies, including the 2012 Tamil movie &quot;Marina&quot; that is entirely based upon the lives of child workers in the beach. The entire story and screenplay for the comedy hit film &quot;Kadhalikka Neramillai&quot; were conceived on Marina Beach and the &quot;Enna Paarvai&quot; song sequence in the film was filmed in this beach.

<doc id="247162" wikidata="Q18458" url="?curid=247162" title="Regional Municipality of York">
<text>The Regional Municipality of York, also called York Region, is a regional municipality in Southern Ontario, Canada, between Lake Simcoe and Toronto. The region was established after the passing of then Bill 102, An Act to Establish The Regional Municipality of York, in 1970. It replaced the former York County in 1971, and is part of the Greater Toronto Area and the inner ring of the Golden Horseshoe. The regional government is headquartered in Newmarket.

As of the 2021 census, York Region&#x27;s population was 1,173,334, with a growth rate of 5.7% from 2016. The Government of Ontario expects its population to surpass 1.5 million residents by 2031. The three largest cities in York Region are Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill.

==History==
At a meeting in Richmond Hill on May 6, 1970, officials representing the municipalities of York County approved plans for the creation of a regional government entity to replace York County. The plan had been presented in 1969 by Darcy McKeough, the Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs, taking about a year to determine municipal boundaries within the new regional government.

The Regional Municipality of York was created by Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1970 (Bill 102 An Act to Establish The Regional Municipality of York), which took effect on January 1, 1971. The creation of the regional municipality resulted in the consolidation of the fourteen former municipalities of York County into nine new municipalities:

The township of Whitchurch merged with the town of Stouffville to create the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville, ceding land to Aurora, Newmarket, and Richmond Hill to the west of the proposed Highway 404 and annexing a northern strip of land from the township of Markham. The western boundary of the new town of Markham was defined to be at Yonge Street, where its northern boundary was formed with Richmond Hill (to which it ceded land) and its western boundary with the new town Vaughan. The new town of Vaughan would consist of all communities in the area bounded by Markham and Richmond Hill in the east, Metro Toronto in the south, the periphery of the regional municipality in the west, and the new township of King in the north.

The townships of Georgina, North Gwillimbury, and Sutton were merged into the township of Georgina, and the East Gwillimbury neighbourhood of East Gwillimbury Heights was merged into Newmarket. King formed the northwestern part of the new region, but the eastern lot from Bathurst Street to Yonge Street was ceded to Newmarket, Aurora, and Oak Ridges, the last of which became a part of Richmond Hill. The boundary between Aurora and Newmarket was defined to be St. John&#x27;s Sideroad, and Newmarket&#x27;s northern boundary was defined to be Green Lane.

The towns of Aurora, Newmarket, and Richmond Hill were defined to be the growth centres for the regional municipality, which was to become a greenbelt between the denser urban areas of Toronto to the south and Barrie to the north. The growth centres were each restricted to grow to a maximum population of 25,000 by 2000, and the regional municipality to 300,000.

The municipal realignment merged 40% of East Gwillimbury&#x27;s population into Newmarket. The council of East Gwillimbury voted to amalgamate with Newmarket, but Newmarket council opposed the amalgamation. In the plan presented by McKeough, the councils of the towns of Newmarket and Aurora were given ten years to decide whether or not to amalgamate.

The internal municipal realignments resulted in some politicians residing in a new municipality from that which they represented at the time of realignment. The reeve of Whitchurch Township resided in the western portion of the town that was annexed by Aurora, three East Gwillimbury councillors resided in land annexed by Newmarket, including its future mayor Ray Twinney, and King councillor Gordon Rowe was a resident of Oak Ridges, which became part of Richmond Hill.

===Hydro Commissions===
Because of the mix of urban and rural areas in the Region, the provision of electricity was governed in a different manner from the rest of the regional services:

:* the hydro-electric commissions and public utilities commissions that existed at the end of 1970 continued to provide electricity within their respective areas;
:* the councillors of the former Township of Vaughan and the trustees of the former Police Village of King City became members of new Hydro-Electric Commissions for their respective areas;
:* Ontario Hydro continued to have responsibility for providing electricity to those portions of the Region that were not served by any of the above commissions.

Electric distribution was partially rationalized in 1978, when:

:* hydro-electric commissions were established for all area municipalities except East Gwillimbury (but it could establish a commission later on, subject to Ontario Hydro&#x27;s consent);
:* effective January 1, 1979, all assets of the former commissions in the Region were transferred to the new commissions;
:* Ontario Hydro withdrew its provision of services from all areas except those in East Gwillimbury, Georgina, King and Whitchurch-Stouffville;
:* Georgina, King and Whitchurch-Stouffville could take over responsibility for such areas at a later date, subject to Ontario Hydro&#x27;s consent

===Police===
The York Regional Police was also created at this time, amalgamating the fourteen town, township, and village police services. Policing on the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation is provided the by the Georgina Island Police.

==Geography==
York Region covers 1,762 square kilometres from Lake Simcoe in the north to the city of Toronto in the south. Its eastern border is shared with Durham Region, to the west is Peel Region, and Simcoe County is to the northwest. A detailed map of the region showing its major roads, communities and points of interest is available.
Towns and cities in York Region include:
*Town of Aurora
*Town of East Gwillimbury
*Town of Georgina
*Township of King
*City of Markham
*Town of Newmarket
*City of Richmond Hill
*City of Vaughan
*Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville

There is also one First Nation with an Indian reserve, where the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation reside on Georgina Island, Fox Island and Snake Island.

York Region&#x27;s landscape includes farmlands, wetlands and kettle lakes, the Oak Ridges Moraine and over 2,070 hectares of regional forest, in addition to the built-up areas of its municipalities. The highest point in the region is within the rolling hills of the moraine near Dufferin St. &amp; Aurora Side Road at 360m ASL (1,243 feet)

===Climate===
York Region is situated in the humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) zone with warm summers and cold winters, ample snowfall, more in the northern part of York region much of it derived from the wind driven snowbelt streamer activity. 
==Government==

The region is governed by York Regional Council, which consists of 20 elected representatives from each of the constituent towns and cities in the region. These include each of the nine mayors, and 11 regional councillors who are elected from the constituent municipalities as follows:
*1 from Georgina
*1 from Newmarket
*2 from Richmond Hill
*3 from Vaughan
*4 from Markham

The regional councilors are elected at-large for each lower-tier municipality which has them. They are also voting members of their respective city/town council.

The leader of Council is referred to as &quot;Regional Chair and CEO&quot;. Wayne Emmerson, a former mayor of Whitchurch-Stouffville, was elected to this office in December 2014 and served until retiring in 2024. Eric Jolliffe was appointed as the new Chair shortly afterwards and will take office on January 1, 2025.

In October 2008, York Regional Municipality was named one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc.

===Federal and provincial representation===
Starting with the 2015 federal election, York Region encompasses all or part of the federal electoral districts of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, King—Vaughan, Markham—Stouffville, Markham—Thornhill, Markham—Unionville, Newmarket—Aurora, Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Vaughan—Woodbridge, and York—Simcoe.

Provincially, York Region is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Members of Provincial Parliament. As of 2018, the provincial electoral districts are the same as the federal districts in most of Ontario.

===Proposed reformations===
In May 2023, Premier Doug Ford announced that he would look to dissolve and restructure existing regional municipalities where deemed prudent. In response, Markham mayor Frank Scarpitti publicly proposed amalgamating York Region into a single-tier municipality, claiming it would save millions of dollars. The idea was met with immediate disapproval from all other York Region mayors, excluding Vaughan Mayor Steven Del Duca, who had not publicly expressed an opinion at the time. Scarpitti was criticized for not consulting with the other mayors about his proposal before publicly announcing it, which the others mayors saw as dramatic. Ford later announced that he had no interest in Scarpitti&#x27;s proposal to amalgamate, and that any future proposals which were to be seriously considered must be deliberated among all of the other mayors in a region before being made public.

Later, Vaughan mayor Steven Del Duca proposed dissolving York Region and making all of its lower-tier municipalities independent, claiming that Vaughan contributed more tax dollars than it received in regional funding. No other politicians endorsed Del Duca&#x27;s proposal. The mayors and councilors of York Region have generally agreed with looking into potential reforms to streamline government operations. However, the mayors of the smaller towns, such as Newmarket and Whitchurch-Stouffville, strongly urged for dialogue and diplomacy, stressing that no municipality should be left behind as a result of a restructuring.

As of January 2025, the Ontario government has not made any indication as to whether York Region will be restructured or remain as-is.

The major highways in the Region are:
*Highway 7 (east-west)
*Highway 9 (east-west)
*Highway 48 (north-south)
*Highway 400 (north-south)
*Highway 404 (north-south)
*Highway 407 (east-west)
*Highway 427 (north-south)

Former highways include:
*Highway 11 (north-south)
*Highway 27 (north-south)
*Highway 47 (east-west)
*Highway 49 (east-west)
*Highway 50 (north-south)

===Air transportation===
Most air travel is served by Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is outside of York Region and is Canada&#x27;s largest airport. Markham Airport is a private aerodrome in Markham. There are also a few small airports with unpaved runways serving the region: Hare Field in Holland Landing (East Gwillimbury), Belhaven Airport in Georgina, and Stouffville Aerodrome north of Stouffville.

Buttonville Municipal Airport was a larger regional airport in Markham that was used for general aviation and business aircraft. It closed in November 2023. 

===Public transportation===
York Region is served by:
*York Region Transit (YRT), which includes the Viva bus rapid transit network
*GO Transit, which offers bus and train service
*Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which has several bus routes which cross York&#x27;s southern border, and which provide service along many north–south arterial streets in Vaughan, Richmond Hill and Markham. Since December 17, 2017, Central Vaughan has been served by the university portion of the Line 1 Yonge-University of Toronto&#x27;s subway system, and a future extension of the Yonge Street portion of the line will eventually serve the boundary areas of Vaughan, Richmond Hill, and Markham.

Until 2001, the towns of York Region operated separate public transit services, which did not connect very well with each other. YRT was created by the Regional Government to combine five of these services:
* Vaughan Transit
* Markham Transit
* Richmond Hill Transit
* Aurora Transit - merged in 1999 with Newmarket Transit
* Newmarket Transit

Since 2001, bus routes have been extensively enhanced in the five communities which had pre-existing services, but YRT&#x27;s services to East Gwillimbury is limited to two routes, and service to King, Georgina and Whitchurch-Stouffville are even more limited due to the relatively small populations in each of those towns.

==Water==
Water in southern York is provided by Toronto Water and Peel Region by way of 3 pumping stations and reservoirs (Bayview, Dufferin and Milliken (tank and underground reservoir)) using water from Lake Ontario. Keswick and Sutton obtain water from Lake Simcoe by way of water treatment plants. The remainder of York obtains water from a combination of water from Lake Ontario and underground wells. Some wells are maintained by the Region and the rest privately.

<text>The most distinctive music of [[Uruguay]] is to be found in the tango and candombe; both genres have been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Uruguayan music includes a number of local musical forms such as murga, a form of musical theatre, and milonga, a folk guitar and song form deriving from Spanish and italian traditions and related to similar forms found in many American countries.

==Folk music==
Charrúa people used wooden drums, hornpipes, flutes, seashells to play music. Other folk musical instruments are marimba and musical bow.

Since colonial times, Uruguay has had its own folk music. Among the most notable countryside musicians are Bartolomé Hidalgo, Santiago Chalar, Osiris Rodríguez Castillos, Tabaré Etcheverry, Juan José de Mello, Cacho Labandera, Anselmo Grau, Amalia de la Vega, Marcos Velásquez, Los Cantaclaro, Abel Soria, Julio Gallego, Teresita Minetti, Oscar Ramírez, Luis Arrúa, Carlos Malo, among others.

===Uruguayan tango===
Tango has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The modern field of tango music and dance arose in Buenos Aires, Argentina as well as Montevideo. Carlos Gardel, the great tango singer, was born in France and raised in Buenos Aires, but in 1920 after becoming famous he registered his birthplace as being in Tacuarembó, Uruguay, probably to avoid problems with French authorities during an upcoming tour of France. Other Uruguayan tango musicians, among the most important names, were director Francisco Canaro and his violinist Modesto Ocampo. Also the singer Julio Sosa. One of the best-known tangos in the world, &quot;La Cumparsita&quot;, was written by Uruguayan composer Gerardo Matos Rodríguez. Modern tango includes the late poet Horacio Ferrer, who contributed lyrics to several of the most important tango works by Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla; celebrated singer-songwriter Malena Muyala and Valeria Lima. As did Piazzolla, Uruguayan composer Miguel del Aguila has also elevated tango to the classical music level in chamber and orchestral works like Concierto en Tango (Grammy nominated 2015), Tango Trio, Salon Buenos Aires (Grammy nominated 2010), Disagree! and many other works. The Uruguayan-Argentinian band Bajofondo is a multi-award winning project which aims to create a more contemporary version of tango and other musical styles of the Río de la Plata region. Juan Campodónico&#x27;s &quot;Campo&quot; consists of a mix of musical styles, including tango, which released album was nominated for a MTV Europe Music Awards, the Grammys, and Latin Grammys.

===Candombe===

Candombe has recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
Candombe originates from the Río de la Plata, where African slaves brought their dances and percussion music. The word &quot;tango&quot; then referred to the traditional drums and dances, as well as the places where dancing occurred. Candombe rhythms are produced by drum ensembles, known as &quot;cuerdas&quot;, which include dozens of drummers and feature three drum sizes: tambor repique, tambor chico and tambor piano, known as tambores de candombe.

Popular candombe musicians include Hugo Fattoruso and Rubén Rada. Fattoruso has been a longtime part of both the Uruguayan and Latin American music scene, including as a member of rock band Los Shakers, and swing band The Hot Blowers, as well as Brazilian Milton Nascimento and the Latin jazz and Acid Jazz group Opa. It was in the 1970s the most important Latin band in the United States according to the magazine &quot;Down Beat&quot;.

The Afro-Uruguayan rhythm Candombe has played a significant role in Uruguayan culture for over 200 years. The rhythm is created by the use of three drums (tambores); tambor piano, tambor chico and tambor repique. The piano is the largest in size and the lowest in pitch of the three tambores. The rhythmic base of Candombe, its function similar to that of the upright or electric bass. The chico (literally &quot;small&quot;) is the smallest in size and highest in pitch of the three tambores, serving as the rhythmic pendulum. The tambor repique (ricochet) embellishes Candombe&#x27;s rhythm with improvised phrases. Each of the three tambores is played with an open hand (mano) and a stick (palo) in the other. At a minimum, one of each of the three tambores must be present.

The purest form of Candombe takes place each Sunday night on the streets of Montevideo, where many drummers assemble, playing their drums under the moonlit sky. Isla de Flores is the main street that joins Cuareim and Ansina, Candombe&#x27;s two main social groups. For over a century spontaneous cuerdas have paraded on this street, and continue to do so today (Isla de Flores is also known by its other name, Carlos Gardel). As the cuerda slowly makes its way through the narrow streets of Montevideo, this contagious rhythm takes with it all in its path, surrounded on all sides by the neighborhood people moving their bodies to the rhythm of Candombe. At intervals the cuerda will pause, and by setting a fire, will heat their drums&#x27; skins for tuning purposes.

===Milonga===

The milonga was an Argentine/Uruguayan style of song that was popular in the 1870s. The milonga was derived from an earlier style of singing known as the &#x27;payada de contrapunto&#x27;.

The song was set to a lively tempo, and often included musical improvisation. Over time, dance steps and other musical influences were added, eventually giving rise to the tango. Milonga music is still used for dancing, but the milonga dancing of today is derivative of tango.

===Murga===
Murga is a kind of Montevidean musical theatre for Carnival celebrations. A traditional murga group comprises a chorus and three percussionists and this is the type of murga performed on stages at Carnival. The singers perform in harmony using up to five vocal parts. Vocal production tends to be nasal and loud with little variation in volume. The percussion instruments, derived from the European military band, are the &quot;bombo&quot; (a shallow bass drum worn at the waist and played horizontally), &quot;redoblante&quot; (snare drum) and &quot;platillos&quot; (cymbals). The two most important pieces of the performance are the opening song (&quot;saludo&quot;) and the exit song (&quot;retirada&quot; or &quot;despedida&quot;).

==Popular music==

===Canto popular===
&quot;Canto popular&quot; (&quot;popular song&quot;), which arose around 1975, eschewed contemporary instrumentation, including electric instruments, allowing only native styles and rhythms. This can be compared to Spanish-language singer-songwriter developments like &quot;nueva canción&quot;, &quot;nueva trova&quot; and &quot;tropicalismo&quot;. Daniel Viglietti was by far the most important Uruguayan exponent of canto popular; his song &quot;A Desalambrar&quot; became an international popular classic. Canto popular peaked in about 1977.

Uruguayan artists involved in canto popular include Alfredo Zitarrosa, El Sabalero and Los Olimareños.

===Candombe beat===
&quot;Candombe beat&quot; began in the late 1960s with El Kinto, a band featuring Ruben Rada and Eduardo Mateo. Emerging at the same time as Los Shakers they forged their own identity with very little Western influence. The beat of candombe formed the rhythm, bossa nova played a large role in its chords and structure, as did traditional Uruguayan folk music. Mateo and Rada would both go on to have successful solo careers, and the music&#x27;s influence would play a large role in Popular Music and Uruguayan rock. 
Totem was the most important group of Candombe Beat in the early 1970s. One of the later exponents of candombe beat was Jaime Roos whose popularity in Uruguay began in the 1970s and has continued through to the 21st century.

=== Cumbia ===
By mid-2015, the Uruguayan bands Rombai and Márama of the emerging subgenre cumbia pop enjoyed great success all over Latin America even before publishing their first albums; particularly in their home country and in Argentina, where in a given moment they had together nine songs at the Spotify Top Ten ranking. Other Uruguayan bands of success are: Toco Para Vos, VI-EM, Toco Para Bailar and Golden Rocket.

===Uruguayan rock===

Rock and roll first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of British band The Beatles in the early 1960s. A wave of bands appeared in Montevideo, including Los Shakers, Los Mockers, Los Iracundos and Los Malditos, who became major figures in the so-called Uruguayan Invasion of Argentina. With the coming of the military dictatorship in 1973, the Uruguayan rock scene effectively died; since the mid-1980s it has resurged. Since the beginning of the 2000s Uruguayan rock has achieved a great popularity. Popular bands like La Vela Puerca, No Te Va Gustar, El Cuarteto de Nos, La Trampa or Buitres have a massive following in the Southern Cone. Annual festivals throughout the country like Pilsen Rock in Durazno, Semana de Lavalleja and Minas &amp; Abril in Minas, or Semana de la Cerveza in Paysandú, peaked more than 100,000 people several years with some of those groups as closing guests.
Other important bands are Trotsky Vengaran, Hereford, Once Tiros, Bufón, La Triple Nelson and La Tabaré. Indie and alternative artists include Juan Wauters and The Islingtons.

==Classical music==

The modern conductors Gisele Ben-Dor and Carlos Kalmar are renowned in their field. Abel Carlevaro, a classical guitar virtuoso performer is worldwide known for having established a new school of instrumental technique. Among the best-known composers of Uruguay we find Eduardo Fabini, Miguel del Aguila, Luis Cluzeau Mortet and Hector Tosar.

There are several classical orchestras performing countrywide. 
The SODRE (acronym for &quot;Official Service for broadcasting Radio, TV, and Performing Arts&quot;) is the main institution generating cultural activities for the whole country. Created in 1929, it manages a symphonic orchestra, a chamber music and ballet ensembles, a choir, among others. Among its past artistic directors, was the Uruguayan classical composer, Pedro Ipuche Riva.
Montevideo&#x27;s City Hall has several orchestras performing classical as well as popular music, like the Orquesta Filarmónica de Montevideo.

==Other genres==

The Oscar-winning singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler has a prolific career, mostly on the Latin rock genre. Luciano Supervielle has collaborated with him, as well as with Juan Campodónico and is a member of Bajofondo.

Since 1997 La Teja Pride (stylized as &quot;latejapride*&quot; or &quot;ltp*&quot;) is an alternative hip hop band/collective from Montevideo. In the 1990s El Peyote Asesino was also a prominent hip-hop band, and Plátano Macho also ventured into rap.

Goodfellas also known as &#x27;Buenos Muchachos&#x27; is an alternative rock band from Montevideo.

Latin rock band Abuela Coca alongside Chala Madre are the most representative reggae bands; both also mix ska and rock.

<text>A tiara (from , from ) is a jeweled head ornament. Its origins date back to ancient Greco-Roman world. In the late 18th century, the tiara came into fashion in Europe as a prestigious piece of jewelry to be worn by women at formal occasions. The basic shape of the modern tiara is a semi-circle, usually made of silver, gold or platinum and richly decorated with precious stones, pearls or cameos.

Tiaras were extremely popular during the late 19th century and were worn at events where the dress code was white tie. After World War I, wearing a tiara gradually fell out of fashion, except for official occasions at a royal court. Interest in tiaras has increased again since the beginning of the 21st century. The word &quot;tiara&quot; is often used interchangeably with the word &quot;diadem&quot;.

== Description ==
The basic shape of the modern tiara is a semi-circle, usually made of silver, gold or platinum. Tiaras have also been made from tortoiseshell, coral and quartz, and in the 20th century unusual materials such as horn and aluminum were experimented with.

Tiaras are usually richly decorated with precious stones, pearls or cameos, often arranged in symmetrical patterns. Common elements in these patterns are arcs, garlands, circles, stars, and stylised flowers or leaves. Occasionally, flowers, ears of corn, dragonflies or butterflies are depicted more or less &quot;true to life&quot; by using gemstones in different colours. A tiara can contain hundreds to thousands of gemstones of different sizes and cuts; almost always, tiaras incorporate a large number of diamonds. This puts tiaras among the most expensive and spectacular pieces of jewelry.

Tiaras come in different models, including:

* the bandeau, a tiara in the shape of a ribbon or hairband,
* the kokoshnik, a tiara that usually consists of a massive wall of gemstones; the shape is based on the traditional Russian headdress with the same name,
* the circlet, a tiara that extends around the circumference of the head,
* the fringe, a fringed trim of diamonds that can often also be worn as a necklace.
Tiaras are worn on the head, but also around the forehead; this depends on the model of the tiara and the fashion of the day. Wearing a tiara can lead to headaches. To make it more comfortable to wear, a large tiara is often attached to a supporting frame that is cushioned by wrapping it with velvet ribbons.

Some tiaras can be disassembled into elements that can be worn individually as a necklace or brooch. Tiaras are sometimes part of a parure: a matching set of, for example, tiara, necklace, earrings, brooches and bracelets.

== Etiquette ==

It is sometimes thought that only titled women are allowed to wear a tiara, but that is not true. Any woman can wear a tiara to events where the dress code &quot;white tie&quot; applies. However, events in hotels are excluded.

Traditionally, young women do not wear a tiara until they are married. On their wedding day, they would wear a tiara owned by their birth family. Once a woman was married, she should only wear tiaras that were owned by her husband&#x27;s family, or her own personal property. There was an exception for unmarried princesses who were allowed to wear tiaras from the age of eighteen. In the 21st century, these rules are no longer strictly applied.

There are special black tiaras made of jet, onyx, glass or steel to be worn with mourning clothes. For the later stages of mourning (second mourning and half mourning), tiaras with purple stones (amethyst), white stones (diamond and moonstone) or pearls were also considered appropriate.

==History==
=== Pre-18th century ===
The words &quot;tiara&quot; and &quot;diadem&quot; both come from head ornaments worn in ancient time by men and women to denote high status. As Geoffrey Munn notes, &quot;The word &#x27;tiara&#x27; is actually Persian in origin—the name first denoted the high-peaked head-dresses of Persian kings, which were encircled by &#x27;diadems&#x27; (bands of purple and white decoration). Now, it is used to describe almost every form of decorative head ornament.&quot; Ancient Greeks and Romans used gold to make wreath-shaped head ornaments, while the Scythians&#x27; resembled a stiff halo that would serve as the inspiration for later Russian kokoshniks. The use of tiaras and diadems declined along with the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity.

From the early Middle Ages onwards, European princesses and queens were known to wear crowns, and brides wore special bridal crowns on their wedding day. In the 17th and 18th centuries, reigning queens began to wear head ornaments to indicate their special status. This custom did not catch on widely, partly because the enormous ladies&#x27; hairstyles of the eighteenth century made wearing a tiara difficult.

=== 18th and 19th century ===
In the late 18th century, Neoclassicism gave rise to a revival of tiaras, but this time it was a solely female adornment. Jewelers taking inspiration from Ancient Greece and Rome created new wreaths made from precious gemstones. Napoleon and his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais are credited with popularizing tiaras along with the new Empire style. Napoleon wanted the French court to be the grandest in Europe and gave his wife many parures which included tiaras. A number of tiaras made for Napoleon&#x27;s first wife Joséphine are still in the possession of European royal houses, such as the Swedish cameo tiara.

In the 19th century, the tiara quickly became popular among royal and noble women as a way of expressing status and attracting attention. The tiara became an essential part of women&#x27;s attire for court ceremonies, balls, dinners and other gala occasions. Often, a bride received a tiara as a gift from her husband or father on her wedding day.

The height of the tiara&#x27;s popularity lay between 1890 and 1914. Women from the highest — and richest — social classes often had several tiaras to choose from. Wearing a tiara was no longer something just for the nobility. In the United States, too, tiaras were common at gala occasions, especially in New York upper social circles. Great jewelry houses like Garrard, Fabergé, Chaumet, Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels all produced tiaras for their clientele.

=== 20th and 21st century ===

With the advent of Jugendstil and Art Nouveau, the line between jewellery and art became blurred. Artists such as René Lalique and the British architect and jewellery designer Henry Wilson created artistic tiaras that could not easily be worn in real life.

After the First World War, it became less fashionable to wear a tiara. This was due to social and economic changes (ostentatious display of wealth was considered less acceptable) but also to the fact that women cut their hair short and — after the introduction of shampoo — washed their hair more often. Clean hair is smooth and soft, offering less &#x27;grip&#x27; for a tiara. During the Art Deco period between World War I and World War II, tiaras were made using the rigid geometric patterns associated with this style; these were also often designed to be easy to wear with short hair. In the 1960s, the tiara briefly reappeared when the high-cropped beehive hairstyle became popular.

Since the end of the twentieth century, tiaras are worn almost exclusively at state banquets, royal weddings and coronations. At &#x27;white-tie&#x27; occasions a tiara is no longer required. However, tiaras are still being made and some auction houses and jewellers are seeing an increased interest in tiaras since the beginning of the 21st century. Fashion designer Versace made a tiara which was worn by pop star Madonna. The Danish royal family has a tiara on loan that was designed in 2009 for an exhibition of classic and modern tiaras.

== Collections ==
Queen Elizabeth II was said to have had the largest and most valuable collection of tiaras in the world, many of which are heirlooms of the British royal family. She was often seen wearing them on state occasions. Queen Mary purchased the Grand Duchess Vladimir tiara in the 1920s. It consists of numerous interlocking diamond circles. Pearl drops or emeralds can be attached inside the circles. Queen Mary had a tiara made for the Delhi Durbar held in 1911 in India. It is now on loan for wearing by Queen Camilla, wife of King Charles III. Queen Elizabeth II commissioned a ruby and diamond tiara. A gift of aquamarines she received as a present from the people of Brazil were added to diamonds to make a new tiara.

Other queens, empresses, and princesses regularly wear tiaras at formal evening occasions. The Swedish Royal Family have a collection as do the Danish, the Dutch, and Spanish monarchies. Many of the Danish royal jewels originally came into the collection when Princess Louise of Sweden married the future King Frederik VIII of Denmark. The Romanov dynasty had a collection up until the revolution of 1917. The Iranian royal family also had a large collection of tiaras. Since the Iranian Revolution, they are housed at the National Jewelry Museum in Tehran.

On rare occasions, usually when the actual tiara is exceptionally old and valuable due to its history and gemstones, realistic copies may be made and worn in place of the original due to insurance considerations.

<doc id="247166" wikidata="Q518861" url="?curid=247166" title="Frank Carlucci">
<text>Frank Charles Carlucci III ( ; October 18, 1930 – June 3, 2018) was an American politician who served as the United States Secretary of Defense from 1987 to 1989 in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. He was the first Italian American to serve in that position.

Carlucci served in a variety of senior-level governmental positions, including Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Nixon administration, Deputy Director of the CIA in the Carter administration, and Deputy Secretary of Defense and National Security Advisor in the Reagan administration.

== Early life ==
Carlucci was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Roxann (née Bacon) and Frank Charles Carlucci, Jr., an insurance broker. His father was of Italian and Swiss-Italian descent. His grandfather was from Santomenna, Italy.

After graduating from Wyoming Seminary in 1948, Carlucci attended Princeton University, where he roomed with Donald Rumsfeld. Carlucci graduated with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1952 after completing a 153-page senior thesis, &quot;Two American Businesses in Costa Rica.&quot; He then attended Harvard Business School for an M.B.A. in 1954–1955. He was an officer in the US Navy from 1952 to 1954. He joined the US Foreign Service and worked for the US State Department from 1956 to 1969.

== Early career ==
In 1961, Carlucci was the second secretary at the US Embassy in the Congo. During that time, Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of independent Congo, was killed in January 1961 during the Congo Crisis.

According to subsequently-released US government documents, US President Dwight Eisenhower ordered the CIA to eliminate Lumumba. Minutes of an August 1960 National Security Council meeting confirm that Eisenhower told CIA chief Allen Dulles to &quot;eliminate&quot; the Congolese leader. The official notetaker, Robert H. Johnson, testified to that before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1975. However, subsequent investigations indicate that Lumumba was ultimately executed by an order of a political rival, Moïse Tshombe, who led the State of Katanga, with Belgian assistance.

According to Robert B. Oakley, Carlucci befriended the future Congo Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula in 1959-1960, who was then a Congolese Member of Parliament. According to James Schlesinger, Adoula began a White House meeting with President John F. Kennedy with the question &quot;&quot; (&quot;Where is Carlucci?&quot;). Kennedy first responded, &quot;Who the hell is Carlucci?&quot; He then sent Dean Rusk to find him. Oakley added that that instance was &quot;the beginning of Carlucci&#x27;s meteoric rise!&quot;

A fictionalized 2000 biopic, &quot;Lumumba&quot;, directed by Raoul Peck, portrayed Carlucci as being involved during his service in Congo in the murder of Lumumba. Carlucci furiously denied the claims and successfully went to court to prevent his being named in the film when it was released in the United States.

== Service in presidential administrations ==

In 1969, when US President Richard Nixon persuaded U.S Representative Donald Rumsfeld to leave his seat to become the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the agency created by Sargent Shriver to fight Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty, Rumsfeld had Carlucci transferred to OEO from the State Department to head up the Community Action Program. Carlucci was Undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare when Caspar Weinberger was secretary during the Nixon administration.

In the aftermath of the catastrophic flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in June 1972, Nixon designated Carlucci to lead the federal response in northeastern Pennsylvania because of his personal ties to the region. At the time, Agnes was the costliest tropical cyclone in U.S. history, and the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania was one of the worst hit areas. Carlucci&#x27;s time in this role was viewed positively by commonwealth and local officials, as well as the general public, given his local ties and effectiveness.

Carlucci became Ambassador to Portugal and served in that position from 1974 to 1977. He was remembered in Portugal among the winners of the coup of 25 November 1975. The Carlucci American International School of Lisbon, the oldest American school in the Iberian Peninsula, is named after him. In 2019, the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, located in the Lapa neighborhood of Lisbon, was named in his honor.

Carlucci was Deputy Director of the CIA from 1978 to 1981, under Director Stansfield Turner.

=== Department of Defense ===
Carlucci was United States Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1983. He served as United States National Security Advisor from 1986 to 1987, where he appointed Colin Powell, later his successor, as Deputy National Security Advisor.

Carlucci became US Secretary of Defense in 1987 after Caspar Weinberger resigned due his wife&#x27;s disabling back pain. Carlucci served in that position until the end of the Reagan administration, on January 20, 1989. Carlucci was notable during the administration for advocating an arms build-up to hasten the end of the Cold War, a policy that Reagan followed.

== Later life ==
===Business===
After leaving the Reagan administration in 1983, Carlucci was named president and later chairman of Sears World Trade, a subsidiary of Sears. Sears announced it would wind down the subsidiary in October 1986. By December, 1986, Carlucci returned to government service. 
Carlucci served as chairman of the Carlyle Group from 1992 to 2003 and chairman emeritus until 2005. He had business interests in the following companies: Ashland Global Holdings, General Dynamics, Westinghouse, Neurogen, CB Commercial Real Estate, Nortel, BDM International, Quaker Oats, and Kaman. Carlucci was at one time a director of the private security firm Wackenhut and was a co-founder and senior member of the Frontier Group, a private-equity investment firm. Carlucci was an advisory board member of G2 Satellite Solutions and the Chairman Emeritus of Nortel Networks.

=== Organizations ===
Carlucci was affiliated with the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), a conservative think tank. He was Chairman Emeritus of the US-Taiwan Business Council after he had been Chairman from 1999 to 2002; he was succeeded in 2003 by William Cohen. Carlucci was a member of the Board of Trustees of the RAND Corporation and was a founding co-chair of the Advisory Board for RAND&#x27;s Center for Middle East Public Policy. He was also a member of the Honorary Board of the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that advocates drug legalization.

== Personal life and death ==
Carlucci was married to Billie Jean Anthony from 1954 until the couple divorced in 1974. They had two children. Carlucci was later married to Marcia McMillan Myers from 1976 until his death. They had one daughter.

Carlucci died on June 3, 2018, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, at his home in McLean, Virginia, at the age of 87.

<text>A pendant is a loose-hanging piece of jewellery, generally attached by a small loop to a necklace, which may be known as a &quot;pendant necklace&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pendant/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A pendant earring is an earring with a piece hanging down. Its name stems from the Latin word &quot;pendere&quot; and Old French word &quot;pendr&quot;, both of which translate to &quot;to hang down&quot;. In modern French, &quot;pendant&quot; is the gerund form of &quot;pendre&quot; (&quot;to hang&quot;) and also means &quot;during&quot;. The extent to which the design of a pendant can be incorporated into an overall necklace makes it not always accurate to treat them as separate items.

In some cases, though, the separation between necklace and pendant is far clearer.

==Overview==

Pendants are among the oldest recorded types of bodily adornment. Stone, shell, pottery, and more perishable materials were used. Ancient Egyptians commonly wore pendants, some shaped like hieroglyphs.

Pendants can have several functions, which may be combined:
* Award (i.e., Scouting Ireland Chief Scout&#x27;s Award, Order of CúChulainn) 
* Identification (i.e., religious symbols, sexual symbols, symbols of rock bands)
* Ornamentation
* Ostentation (i.e., jewels).
* Protection (i.e., amulets, religious symbols)
* Self-affirmation (i.e., initials, names)

The many specialized types of pendants include lockets which open, often to reveal an image, and pendilia, which hang from larger objects of metalwork.

== Types ==
Throughout the ages, pendants have come in a variety of forms to serve a variety of purposes.
=== Amulet ===
Though amulets come in many forms, a wearable amulet worn around the neck or on the arm or leg in the form of a pendant is the most common. These are objects believed to possess magical or spiritual power to protect the wearer from danger or dispel evil influences.

=== Talisman ===
Similar to an amulet, a talisman is an object believed to possess supernatural traits. However, while an amulet is strictly a defensive object, a talisman is meant to confer special benefits or powers upon the wearer.
=== Locket ===
A locket is a small object that opens to reveal a space which serves to hold a small object, usually a photograph or a curl of hair. They typically come in the form of a pendant hanging from a necklace, though they will occasionally be hung from a charm bracelet.

=== Medallion ===
A medallion is most often a coin-shaped piece of metal worn as a pendant around the neck or pinned onto clothing. These are generally granted as awards, recognitions, or religious blessings.

===Painting===

Pendant is the name given to one of two paintings conceived as a pair. They usually are gift from couples and some cultures consider the act of giving one a marry proposition.

===Functional pendants===

Tools worn as pendants include Maori pounamu pendants. Shepherd&#x27;s whistles, bosun&#x27;s whistles, and ocarinas can also be made as pendants. Portable astronomical and navigational instruments were made as pendants. 

In the first decade of the 21st century, jewellers started to incorporate USB flash drives into pendants.

===Fashion pendants===
Fashion pendants include a small creative piece often made from precious or non-precious stones and metals like diamonds or pearls hanging freely from a chain or necklace. These are generally worn as a statement piece or a fashion ornament.

===Other types===
* Harness pendant

==See also==
* Boule de Genève
* Petit chien à bélière
* Yupei - Chinese jade pendant
* Jewellery chain

<doc id="247169" wikidata="Q645992" url="?curid=247169" title="Music of Argentina">
<text>The music of Argentina includes a variety of traditional, classical, and popular genres. According to the &quot;Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot;, Argentina also has &quot;one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life.&quot;

One of the country&#x27;s most significant cultural contributions is the tango, which originated in Buenos Aires and its surrounding areas during the end of the 19th century. Folk music was popular during the mid-20th century, experiencing a revival in popularity during the 1950s and 1960s with the rise of the Nuevo cancionero movement. The mid-to-late 1960s also saw the rise of Argentine rock (known locally as &quot;rock nacional&quot;), which is considered one of the earliest incarnations of Spanish-language rock to have an autochthonous identity that prioritized original compositions in Spanish. Rock nacional was widely embraced by the youth and has become an important part of the country&#x27;s musical identity.

==Folk music==
Folk music—known as &quot;música folklórica&quot; or &quot;folklore&quot; in Spanish, from the English &quot;folklore&quot;—is a music genre that includes both traditional folk music and contemporary folk music, which emerged from the genre&#x27;s 20th-century revival. Argentine folk music comes in many forms and has Indigenous, European, and African influences.

In the late 50s, Argentina experienced a &quot;folklore boom.&quot; Among the most influential groups of the time were Los Chalchaleros, from Salta; Los Fronterizos, also from Salta; and Los Hermanos Ábalos from Santiago del Estero. Composer Ariel Ramírez and guitarist Eduardo Falú were also notable figures during this period.

Between 1960 and 1974, Leda Valladares created a documentary series, known as the &quot;Mapa musical argentino&quot; (&quot;Musical Map of Argentina&quot;), taping traditional folk music throughout the country. The recordings she made were funded by the National Endowment of the Arts and directed by Litto Nebbia for Melopea Records.

The Nuevo Cancionero movement was officially codified in Argentina in February 1963 with the &quot;Manifiesto Fundacional de Nuevo Cancionero&quot; (&quot;Foundational manifesto of the New Songbook&quot;). It was written by Armando Tejada Gómez, with the collaboration of artists like Mercedes Sosa, Oscar Matus, Tito Francia, and Eduardo Aragón. Atahualpa Yupanqui was another important figure in the movement.

The 1976 dictatorship created a difficult environment for folk music. The military censored, blacklisted, and prosecuted artists, and many received anonymous phone calls warning them: &quot;o te callas o sos tierra de cementerio&quot; (&quot;either you shut up, or you&#x27;re cemetery land&quot;). Many artists left the country, and their music was not distributed in Argentina at the time. The repressive actions and black lists against artists and intellectuals to be kidnapped or censored were known as &quot;Operativo Claridad&quot; (&quot;Operation Clarity&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The 1980s saw a resurgence of folk music after the Falklands War, which led to the fall of the dictatorship. Popular artists included Sixto Palavecino and Facundo Cabral.

Folk music continues to enjoy success in Argentina. Soledad &quot;La Sole&quot; Pastorutti brought folk music to a new audience at the end of the 20th century, and, in the early 21st century, Juana Molina has earned a cult following for her fusion of electronic music, folk music and ambient sounds. In 2004, the album &quot;Cantor de Cantores&quot;, by Horacio Guarany, was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.

=== Notable folk music festivals ===
The Cosquín National Folklore Festival is an annual music festival held in Cosquín—a small town in Córdoba, Argentina. The festival first took place between 21 and 29 January 1961, and has grown to include musicians from across Argentina and neighboring countries. The principal focus of the festival is traditional folk music, but other genres are presented.

Though not an official partner, Cosquín en Japón (&quot;Cosquín in Japan&quot;)—a three-day folk festival held in Kawamata, Fukushima, Japan—does derive its name from the Cosquín National Folklore Festival.

The Cosquín National Folklore Festival typically includes representatives from musical genres developed in Argentina and its surrounding areas, including:

=== Variations of Argentine Folk Music By Region ===

====Andean music====
Andean music refers to a group of Indigenous musical styles from the Andes. In Northern Argentina, tarkeada is a popular style played on wooden flutes.

Noted interpreters of Andean music include Jaime Torres, a charango player, and Micaela Chauque, a Qulla Argentine composer who specializes in the quena and siku.

Andean music has also been fused with other styles of music by musicians such as pianist Daniel Tinte and on songs such as &quot;Cuando pase el temblor&quot; by Soda Stereo and &quot;Lamento boliviano&quot; by Los Enanitos Verdes.

====Chacarera====

Chacarera is a traditional folk dance and musical style developed in the rural northwest of Argentina, namely in Santiago del Estero, with both African and European influences. The name chacarera has its origins in the Andean term &quot;chacra&quot;, which refers to farms or agricultural fields. Some academics theorize that the dance developed as a tribute to the female workers of these farms.

The traditional instruments used in chacarera are guitars, violins and the bombo legüero.

In January, Santiago del Estero hosts the annual Festival Nacional de la Chacarera (&quot;National Chacarera Festival&quot;). The festival was founded in 1971 by folk musicians Agustín and Carlos Carabajal.

====Chamamé====

Chamamé is a traditional folk dance and musical style from northeast Argentina, with Corrientes often cited as the style&#x27;s birthplace. It has Guaraní, Paraguayan, Spanish, and central European influences, and incorporates elements of popular dances from the 19th century, such as the waltz, mazurka, and Paraguayan polka.

The traditional instruments used in chamamé are the violin and vihuela. Guitars, harmonicas, accordions, bandoneons and double basses were later incorporated.

Notable chamamé musicians include Teresa Parodi, Raúl Barboza, Chango Spasiuk, Tránsito Cocomarola, Ramona Galarza, and Alejandro Brittes.

==Popular music==
=== Tango ===
Tango was developed in the bars and port areas of Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay, by the cities&#x27; urban lower class. It emerged as a fusion of various styles of music from across the globe including European styles such as flamenco, minuet, polka, mazurka, and contradanza; Argentine and Uruguayan folk music, including candombe, payada and milonga (considered a precursor to tango); and sub-Saharan African influences.

The Golden Age of tango is generally considered to have been from 1935 to 1952. At this time, tango was generally performed by large orchestral groups known as orquestas típicas, which typically featured over a dozen performers. Notable band leaders at the time included Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro, Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Juan d&#x27;Arienzo, and Alfredo De Angelis. Notable vocalists from the era included Carlos Gardel, Roberto Goyeneche, Hugo del Carril, Tita Merello, Susana Rinaldi, Edmundo Rivero, and Ignacio Corsini.

In the 1950s, Astor Piazzolla revolutionized tango with his nuevo tango, which incorporated elements of jazz and classical music. Though his innovations were initially scorned by traditionalists, Piazzolla&#x27;s compositions eventually earned him widespread recognition and celebration. Many musicians who worked with Piazzolla went on to have their own successful careers, including violinist Antonio Agri; fellow bandoneón virtuosi José Libertella and Rodolfo Mederos; and pianists Horacio Salgán and Pablo Ziegler.

Today, tango continues to enjoy popularity on both a local and international level. Buenos Aires is home to both professional demonstrations and local gatherings at bars and community centers across the city, and hosts the annual Campeonato Mundial de Baile de Tango, typically in August. Groups like Tanghetto, Bajofondo, Gotan Project, and Típica Messiez bring both nuevo tango and traditional tango to new audiences.

Finnish tango, an established variation of the Argentine tango but whose rhythm follows the ballroom tango, is popular in Finland.

===Rock Music===
Rock music from Argentina, commonly known as Argentine rock or &quot;rock nacional&quot; (&quot;national rock&quot;), is one of the earliest incarnations of Spanish-language rock. Argentina was one of the major exporters of &quot;rock en español&quot; during the 1980s, with several Argentine acts achieving international success during the decade, including Soda Stereo, Virus, and Enanitos Verdes.

Subgenres of Argentine rock may include:
* Pop: Virus, Los Abuelos de la Nada, Fito Páez
* Ska: Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Auténticos Decadentes, Todos Tus Muertos
* Reggae: Los Pericos, Lumumba, Dread Mar-I
* Folk rock: Sui Generis, Las Pastillas del Abuelo, Pedro y Pablo, León Gieco
* Blues: Manal, Memphis La Blusera
* Hardcore: Fun People, Nueva Ética
* English-language: Sumo, Triddana, Maxi Trusso, Siamés

==== 1960s ====

Early Argentine rock and roll was heavily influenced by Anglophone artists. Singer and actor Sandro initially styled himself after Elvis Presley, and even earned the nickname &quot;the Argentine Elvis.&quot; His music is often considered a precursor to Argentine rock. At the same time, the variety show &quot;El Club del Clan&quot; hoped to compete in the domestic rock and roll market by offering young people a mixture of pop music, rock and roll, bolero and cumbia. The show was extremely popular and turned its cast—including Palito Ortega, Leo Dan, Billy Caffaro, Violeta Rivas, and Cachita Galán—into the first national teen idols. Both Sandro and &quot;El Club del Clan&quot; offered young Argentines the opportunity to listen to rock and roll in Spanish at a time when the market was dominated by music in English.

Beatlemania reached Argentina during the early 1960s and inspired many local cover bands who sang predominately in English. A definitive shift occurred with Los Gatos&#x27; 1967 single &quot;La balsa,&quot; which established the distinctive sound and emphasis of Spanish-language lyrics that have defined Argentine rock. The 1960s also saw the rise of groups like Almendra, Vox Dei, Manal, and Pedro y Pablo, and singer-songwriters like Tanguito, Moris, and Javier Martinez.

==== 1970s ====

By 1970, Argentine rock had become established among middle-class youth with groups like Almendra, Pescado Rabioso, Color Humano, Arco Iris, Sui Generis, and Serú Girán.

Band lineups were often tenuous, with members frequently leaving or dissolving bands and forming new ones. Notable examples include Luis Alberto Spinetta, who founded Almendra, Pescado Rabioso, and Invisible during the decade, and would form additional bands during the 80s, and Charly García, who formed part of Sui Generis, PorSuiGieco, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, and Serú Girán over the course of the 1970s.

Artists often faced pushback from the military dictatorship, and were often forced to censor their music, or use metaphors to bypass the government.

==== 1980s and 90s ====

During the Falklands War, the dictatorship banned music in English from playing on the radio, giving Argentine musicians additional exposure on the airwaves. This, paired with the fall of the dictatorship in 1983, allowed Argentine rock to grow and reach new audiences in Argentina and abroad. Several Argentine groups were able to achieve international recognition during this period, and were featured in the &quot;Rock en tu idioma&quot; (&quot;Rock in your language&quot;) publicity campaign.

In the 80s, Argentine rock moved away from the folk style that had dominated the 70s and embraced new production styles and irreverent sounds and lyrics with groups like Soda Stereo, Virus, Los Twists, Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll, and Los Abuelos de la Nada gaining popularity. Of course, this &quot;música divertida&quot; (&quot;fun music&quot;) wasn&#x27;t the only music being created during the decade. Sumo, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Todos Tus Muertos brought ska influences into the fold; Riff, La Torre, V8, and Rata Blanca were all notable heavy metal bands; and &quot;rock rolinga&quot;, a style heavily influenced by The Rolling Stones, was popular with groups like Los Ratones Paranoicos. Other important acts included Charly García (now a successful solo artist), Fabiana Cantilo, Celeste Carballo, Sandra Mihanovich, Los Violadores, and Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota.

Like the 1980s, the 1990s saw a continued diversification of influences in Argentine rock. Heavy metal bands like A.N.I.M.A.L., Tren Loco, and Horcas gained more mainstream success; Fito Páez and Los Rodríguez achieved popularity with pop-influenced styles; and Iguana Lovers and Babasónicos were important groups of the &quot;movida sónica&quot; (&quot;sonic movement&quot;), which was a local interpretation of alternative rock.
==== 2000s–present ====
While rock is no longer the dominant genre in Argentina, it continues to play an important role in Argentine national identity. Graffiti of influential artists like Luis Alberto Spinetta, Charly García, and Gustavo Cerati can be spotted around Buenos Aires, and the Cosquín Rock music festival has brought local and international acts to Cosquín, Córdoba since 2001.

Notable acts have included: Él Mató a un Policía Motorizado, Airbag, Árbol, Los Espíritus, Marilina Bertoldi, Eruca Sativa, Fidel Nadal, Tersivel, and Triddana.

=== Electronic ===

Rock musician Gustavo Cerati helped pioneer electronica in South America during the 80s and 90s, and the genre heavily influenced his 1999 album &quot;Bocanada&quot;. The genre continued to grow during the 2000s and many artists gained local notoriety at the Zizek Club nights at the Niceto Club in Buenos Aires. After three years, the club nights evolved into ZZK Records, an independent record label that helped pioneer electro-folklore in Latin America, with a focus on cumbia fusion.

Argentina has also been home to the annual electronic music festival Creamfields BA.

Electronic artists from Argentina include DJ Hernán Cattáneo; indietronica band Entre Ríos; electropop band Miranda!; tango fusion bands Bajofondo Tango Club and the Gotan Project; cumbia fusion artists Faauna and El Remolón; Heatbeat; and DJ and producer Tayhana.

===Pop===
Notable Argentine pop artists include Miranda!, Lali and Tini.

====1950s–1960s====

In the postwar era, pop music in Argentina was significantly influenced by American and English musicians. During the 1950s and 1960s, the &quot;la nueva ola&quot; movement emerged, marking the rise of youth-oriented pop music in South America. Musicians often adapted popular English-language songs into Spanish, appealing to audiences across the country. Notable early pop performers from this period included Billy Cafaro, Violeta Rivas, and Palito Ortega.

====1970s–1980s====
During the 1970s and 1980s, several Argentine rock bands embraced elements of pop, contributing to the emergence of the &quot;música divertida&quot; (&quot;fun music&quot;) movement. Bands like Los Twist, Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll, and Los Abuelos de la Nada integrated catchy choruses and danceable rhythms into their music. Additionally, the cumbia pop group Las Primas gained popularity with songs like &quot;Saca la Mano, Antonio&quot;, further diversifying the Argentine pop landscape.

====1990s–2000s====
The 1990s and 2000s saw the rise of pop groups that significantly influenced the Argentine music scene. Groups Groups such as Miranda!, Bandana, Mambrú, Erreway, Teen Angels and Tan Biónica contributed to the landscape of Argentine pop music.
Miranda! became a stood out in Argentine pop music, pushing boundaries and redefining the genre. Formed in 2001, the band, consisting of Ale Sergi, Juliana Gattas, and Lolo Fuentes, notably, quickly rose to fame with their catchy melodies, playful lyrics, and infectious energy. Their debut album, &quot;Es Mentira&quot;, (2002), gained commercial success and introduced their blend of electronic beats|electronic beats]] and pop melodies. Subsequent albums like &quot;Sin Restricciones&quot; (2004) and &quot;El Disco de Tu Corazón&quot; (2007), reinforced their presence in the industry. Miranda! achieved numerous awards and accolades, including multiple Gardel Awards, highlighting their impact on the genre.

Following the success of global girl groups like the Spice Girls, Bandana was formed through the reality television show &quot;Popstars&quot; and became one of Argentina&#x27;s best-selling groups in the early 2000s. Their performances and catchy songs appealed to teenage girls across the nation. Similarly, Erreway in the early 2000s and Teen Angels in the late 2000s, spawned from the television shows &quot;Rebelde Way&quot; and &quot;Casi Ángeles&quot; respectively, achieved national and international recognition, selling records and attracting significant youth followings.

Notable solo artists during this era include Axel, Alejandro Lerner, Diego Torres, and the Uruguayan Natalia Oreiro.

====2010s–present====

In the 2010s, Argentine pop music witnessed a surge of solo artists who brought fresh energy and innovation to the genre. Lali, formerly a member of the teen pop group Teen Angels, began her solo career in 2013. She introduced a distinctive style that incorporated global pop trends, emphasizing energetic performances, innovative music videos, and fashion-forward outfits.

Lali&#x27;s debut album &quot;A Bailar&quot; (2014) showcased her versatility and marked a shift in Argentine pop music. In 2016, her album &quot;Soy&quot; received critical acclaim and commercial success, further establishing her presence in the industry. By 2023, Lali had released her fifth studio album &quot;Lali&quot;, which featured a variety of sounds reminiscent the late nineties and early 2000s pop, paying homage to artists who dominated the period such as Britney Spears, NSYNC and Jennifer Lopez. Following Lali&#x27;s success, a wave of Argentine artists such as Tini, Emilia, J Mena, Louta, Oriana, and Taichu embraced pop music, propelling the genre to the mainstream.

===Cuarteto===
Cuarteto, sometimes known as cuartetazo, is a form of dance music from Córdoba, Argentina, that is similar to merengue. The word &quot;cuarteto&quot; translates to &quot;quartet&quot; in English—the genre got its name from the Cuarteto Característico Leo, a quartet which is credited with inventing the genre.

Cuarteto has been part of Argentina&#x27;s musical heritage since the 1940s and underwent a significant revival in the 1980s and 90s. Notable acts during this period were La Mona Jiménez and Rodrigo.

Other notable groups include Tru-la-lá, Chébere, el Cuarteto de Oro, and el Cuarteto Berna.

===Cumbia===
Cumbia is a style of music that blends African, Indigenous, and European influences. Argentine cumbia is derived from Colombian cumbia, which is identified by its heavy use of drums and its signature double beat.

Cumbia came to Argentina in the mid-50s. Some of the earliest groups to gain success were the Colombian group Cuarteto Imperial and the multinational group Los Wawancó, whose early members came to Argentina to attend university. Cumbia continued to enjoy success in the 70s and 80s as part of the &quot;movida tropical&quot; (&quot;tropical movement&quot;) in popular music.

Santa Fe, Argentina has been a stronghold of Argentine cumbia and has developed its own style known as cumbia santafesina, which is identified by its distinctive accordion usage. Santa Fe has, additionally, declared 5 November as Día de la Cumbia Santafesina (&quot;day of cumbia santafesina&quot;), in honor of Martín Robustiano &quot;Chani&quot; Gutiérrez (26 April 1944 – 5 November 1992) who was a driving force behind the genre&#x27;s growth.

Cumbia&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough came in the 1990s, with the development of cumbia villera (&quot;slum cumbia&quot;) in the poor neighborhoods of Buenos Aires—it is a genre heavily influenced by Peruvian cumbia, colloquially known as chicha, which uses electric guitars and synthesizers. Argentina was facing a great depression at the time, and the genre&#x27;s depictions of life in poor neighborhoods and recurring themes of sex, crime, drugs, and police violence appealed to Argentine youth. Notable acts include Amar Azul, Flor de Piedra, Damas Gratis, Piola Vago, Yerba Brava, and Pibes Chorros.

In the mid-2010s, cumbia cheta, also known as cumbia pop, gained popularity in Argentina and abroad with groups like Los Bonnitos and Agapornis. Cachengue, a form of Argentine cumbia heavily influenced by reggaeton, also gained popularity during this decade.

Other notable acts include: Leo Mattioli, Gilda, Ráfaga, La Base Musical, Los Palmeras, Los del Fuego, La Nueva Luna, Amar Azul, Mala Fama, Jambao, Antonio Ríos, Daniel Agostini, Karina, Dalila, and Mario Pereyra y su Banda.

==Urbano music==
Urbano music (Spanish: &quot;música urbana&quot;) derives its name from its English-language counterpart urban music. Like urban music, urbano covers a range of genres and styles, many with Black roots or influences, such as trap, dembow, and reggaeton.

===RKT===
RKT—also known as Cachengue, cumbiatón, onda turra or cumbia turra—is a form of Argentine cumbia that is heavily influenced by cumbia villera and reggaeton. The genre emerged in San Martín, Buenos Aires during the 2000s and became popular in Argentina during the 2010s with artists such Los Wachiturros and Nene Malo. The genre has spread to other countries, including Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay. DJ Fer Palacio has made a name for himself by remixing reggaeton songs with elements of cachengue.

A recent subgenre of cachengue is cumbia 420, which is strongly affiliated with cannabis culture. It first gained popular recognition in the early 2020s, with two singles released by L-Gante: &quot;L-Gante Rkt&quot; with producer Papu DJ and &quot;L-Gante: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 38,&quot; with Bizarrap, which was the first &quot;Bzrp Music Sessions&quot; to reach number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Argentina Hot 100.

===Trap===
Trap is a subgenre of rap that developed in the early 2000s in Atlanta, Georgia in the Southern United States. The genre derives its name from trap houses, where drug dealers sell illegal narcotics, and is influenced by G-funk, house, and techno. It typically features drum machines like the Roland TR-808 and its lyrics will focus on gritty depictions of drug use and urban violence.

Trap first gained popularity in Argentina through freestyle rap battles like El Quinto Escalón, which was first held in March 2012 at Rivadavia park in Buenos Aires. Argentine rapper Duki won at El Quinto Escalón in 2016 and his song, &quot;No Vendo Trap,&quot; became the first in the battle&#x27;s history to hit 1 million views on YouTube. Other artists who got their start at these battles include Nicki Nicole, Trueno, Ecko, Tiago PZK, and Paulo Londra. Producer and DJ Bizarrap got his start uploading compilations of these freestyle battles onto his Youtube channel.

==Art music==

===Jazz===

Jazz is an American music genre that originated in the Black communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call-and-response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.

==== Early days ====
Like much of the world, jazz was first introduced to Argentina in the 1920s and 30s. The 1930s and 40s additionally saw a number of publications dedicated to jazz such as &quot;Síncopa y Ritmo&quot;, &quot;Swing&quot;, and &quot;Jazz Magazine&quot;.

The most notable Argentine jazz musician from this period was guitarist Oscar Alemán, who played with the likes of Josephine Baker, Django Reinhardt, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington.

==== 1950s ====

Jazz drummer Tito Alberti founded the Jazz Casino orchestra in 1950. Jazz Casino toured internationally and was known for its fusion of jazz, melódicos, and tropical music. Alberti&#x27;s eldest son—Charly Alberti—is best known as the drummer of Soda Stereo.

During the 1950s, Astor Piazzolla introduced &quot;nuevo tango&quot; to the world, and began to incorporate jazz and classical music elements into his tango compositions.

Lalo Schifrin began his career during this decade.

==== 1960s ====

Jazz tenor saxophonist Leandro &quot;Gato&quot; Barbieri first came to fame during the free jazz movement in the 1960s, and his work with artists like Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Carla Bley. Barbieri would later move to the Latin jazz movement in the 1970s.

==== 1970s ====
Jazz fusion gained traction during the later part of the decade. Influenced by the work of Astor Piazzolla, among others, Rodolfo Mederos released &quot;Fuera de broma&quot; in 1976. The album fused jazz, tango, folk, and rock. On the back cover of the album, Rodolfo wrote that:A friend once told me, referring to all those musicians who fear &#x27;contaminating&#x27; themselves with other music: &#x27;Every border that prevents entry, also prevents departure.&#x27; I always remembered that. My modus operandi was for a time tango. One day I felt as though I were touching a limit. I realized that I had reached a threshold, and from then on I would either stay inside or try to get out by expanding it, growing. I recalled that issue of the borders. I reviewed then, carefully, my relationship with all music and I understood that, without a doubt, I enjoyed, in some way, certain aspects of jazz, of rock, of soul, of &#x27;pop&#x27; music, and obviously tango in its new forms (Astor Piazzolla), and some traditional forms (O. Pugliese, H. Salgán). I got to work with joy and without preconceptions. Later, I thought in the group that should play this music and, in this natural way, arose the idea of the bandoneon block and rhythm section. Then I added the color of the saxophone and flute, and it was set. We rehearsed, performed live and recorded this LP. I made sure we all liked it and that we had fun and I somehow understood that we had taken a step beyond the famous limit. &#x27;Generación Cero&#x27; does not exist today as an established group, but it leaves this document for the consideration of those who also feel the need to expand those limits, their own limits.&quot;Mederos has enjoyed critical success during his career and has toured internationally; worked with the likes of Astor Piazzolla, Mercedes Sosa, and Joan Manuel Serrat; and composed music for several films and stage plays. His group, Generación Cero, continues to perform, though with different musicians and instrumentation.

Other notable musicians who came to prominence during the decade are Pocho Lapouble and Dino Saluzzi.

==== 1980s–Present ====
Alto saxophonist Andrés Boiarsky gained prominence for his contributions to the score of the 1986 film &quot;Hombre mirando al sudeste&quot;. Melopea Discos—a record label founded by Argentine musician Litto Nebbia—was founded in the 1980s and has distributed a number of jazz albums from both Argentine and international artists.

Today, there are jazz clubs across the nation&#x27;s capital. Buenos Aires is also home to the annual Jazzología jazz festival, established by Carlos Inzillo in 1984 and one of the country&#x27;s longest-running music festivals; The Festival Internacional de Jazz Django Argentina (&quot;International Django Jazz Festival Argentina&quot;), established in 2003 as part of the Jazzología jazz festival; and the Festival Internacional Buenos Aires Jazz (&quot;Buenos Aires International Jazz Festival&quot;).

=== Classical music ===
The Orquesta Filarmónica de Buenos Aires (&quot;Buenos Aires Philharmonic&quot;) was established in 1946 under the name Orquesta Sinfónica del Teatro Municipal (&quot;Municipal Theater Symphony Orchestra&quot;). It was the first official, exclusively symphonic, orchestra of the city of Buenos Aires, and was housed in the Teatro Municipal. The orchestra was moved to the Teatro Colón in 1953, and was renamed the Orquesta Filarmónica de Buenos Aires in 1958. The Orchestra has toured internationally, and performed with established national and international soloists, including Astor Piazzolla, Martha Argerich, Paco de Lucía, Luciano Pavarotti, Yehudi Menuhin, Itzkak Perlman, and Joshua Bell. Enrique Diemecke has led the orchestra since 2007.

Another prominent orchestra is the Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional (&quot;Argentine National Symphony Orchestra&quot;), founded in 1948 as the Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado. The Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional has toured internationally and won several distinctions within Argentina, including the Asociación de Críticos Musicales de la Argentina&#x27;s award for &quot;Best Orchestra&quot; for the 1996, 2000 and 2002 seasons. Pedro Ignacio Calderón lead the orchestra from 1994 to 2015.

Notable Argentine musicians include composers Juan José Castro, who served as the director of the National Symphony in Buenos Aires from 1956 to 1960; Alberto Williams, one of the first Argentine composers to achieve international fame; Carlos Guastavino, whose compositions were heavily influenced by Argentina&#x27;s folk music; Judith Akoschky; Daniel Barenboim, who has directed the Orchestre de Paris, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin State Opera; and Alberto Ginastera, considered Argentina&#x27;s leading composer of the 20th century.
