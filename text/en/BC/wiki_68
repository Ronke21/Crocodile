<text>Caterham Cars Ltd. is a British manufacturer of specialist lightweight sports cars established in Caterham, England, with their headquarters in Dartford, England. Their current model, the Caterham 7 (or Seven), originally launched in 1973, is a direct evolution of the Series 3 Lotus Seven designed by Colin Chapman. In the 1990s the company made the Caterham 21, a two-seater soft top alternative to the MG F and Lotus Elise, (which both sold many more units). A track-only car, the SP/300.R, a joint project with Lola was released for customer testing in 2010 and was scheduled for release in 2013. 

Caterham was an independent company until their acquisition by Team Lotus in 2011, leading to the formation of Caterham Group. In 2021, Caterham Cars was acquired by VT Holdings, Japanese importer for the Caterham Seven since 2009.

== History ==

=== Lotus origins ===

Colin Chapman&#x27;s Lotus Cars launched the Series 1 Lotus Seven in 1957. The car was immediately embraced by enthusiasts as a low-cost, lightweight sports car and successful race car. Revised Series 2, Series 3 and Series 4 versions were subsequently launched in 1960, 1968 and 1970 respectively.

Caterham Cars had been a major Lotus 7 dealer during the 1960s, and its founder, Graham Nearn, purchased the rights to continue manufacture of the Seven design from Chapman in 1973, after Lotus announced its intention to discontinue the model. Caterham initially restarted manufacture of the Lotus Seven Series 4; however, when this proved unpopular, production switched to a Series 3 model in 1974.

In 1974, under the name of Seven Cars Limited, Caterham built 20 production cars with chassis numbers 1 to 20 and one prototype, with chassis number 0 (CS3 3550 – CS3 3570).
Of the 21 cars produced in the first year, all were fitted with the Ford Lotus Twin Cam 1557cc engine, with the exception of chassis number 7 which, intended for racing, was fitted with a 1962cc twin cam engine sourced from Alfa Romeo.

The Lotus/Caterham 7 is widely regarded by car enthusiasts and the media as one of the signature sports cars of the 20th century. With 2007 marking the 50th year of continuous production, the Seven still enjoys strong support and success in clubman-style racing.

Since 2006 Caterham Cars has been run by an ex-Lotus management team led by Ansar Ali (CEO) and Mark Edwards (COO). In June 2012 Ansar Ali announced he was to leave Caterham Cars and Graham Mcdonald (the company&#x27;s former CFO) became the new CEO.

=== Construction ===
As with its Lotus Seven precursors, Caterhams are constructed of aluminium sheet attached to a tubular steel chassis. Nose cone and wings are either GRP or carbon fibre depending on specification. All Sevens are front-engined with rear-wheel drive and two seats. Their extremely high performance is achieved through light weight (less than on some versions) rather than particularly powerful engines. As well as a lightweight chassis and bodywork, Caterham Sevens achieve their very low mass through their lack of comfort and safety oriented features such as a fixed roof, doors, radio, air-conditioning, airbags, traction/stability control, ABS, satellite navigation or cruise control. As a result, the Seven is somewhat limited in its practicality for everyday usage and is instead recognised by driving enthusiasts for its focus on driving enjoyment, making it an ideal track/race car or &#x27;Sunday&#x27; car.

=== Kit format ===
Chapman and Lotus helped to pioneer the British kit car industry. The Lotus Seven was offered in kit form to allow buyers to avoid new car tax in the UK. Subsequently, Caterham continued offering cars in &#x27;complete knock down&#x27; (CKD) kit form as the tradition of hand building your own Seven was well established amongst enthusiasts. Today, all Caterham Sevens are still offered in kit form in the UK except the CSR (Series 6) model. Modern Caterham kits differ from the majority of kit cars as all parts are supplied ready to assemble, not requiring a donor car, fabrication or any special skills.

=== International ===
Although the Seven has always been popular with enthusiasts outside of the UK marketplace, export of the Seven to other markets has increasingly been limited by homologation, safety and emissions regulations in the modern era. As a result, the chassis/engine combinations, specifications, pricing and kit-form availability vary widely between countries.

In the past in the United States Caterhams were sold as kits only, lacking some modern safety features required of manufacturers, but which are not required for individually assembled vehicles. Buyers could either choose to construct the cars themselves or pay their regional dealers or local builders to assemble them. Typically the engine and transmission are sourced separately as a unit – often from Caterham – but all other components (including frame, suspension, differential, driveshaft, interior, wiring and instruments) were provided in kit form.

In the UK, the vehicles can be obtained as kits or entirely assembled by Caterham and registered for the road under IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) regulations. In the &#x27;60s, the original Lotus Seven was sold only in kit form in both the UK and the US, in order to evade the very high taxes on complete new cars that were not assessed on automobile parts.

==== United States ====

As of 2014, however, Caterham has named Superformance their official distributor in the United States. International demand has increased dramatically in part due to the addition of a F1 Race team and the changes in Caterham&#x27;s structure focusing on the distribution of the Seven worldwide. Caterham has since introduced a new model line up and focused on their production and production times to better suit their new international market, making their partnership with Superformance possible. Sevens will be shipped to the US in part-built form and sold as rolling chassis via Superformance&#x27;s nationwide dealer network for customers to then complete the build personally or through the Superformance dealership. The initial US line-up includes several Caterham Sevens: 280, 360, 480, and the 620R.

=== Location ===
Until 1987 the offices, factory and showroom of Caterham Cars were located in the town of Caterham, Surrey.

In 1987, the production and administration of the company moved to a new factory in Dartford, Kent.

Caterham Cars retained a &quot;Caterham South&quot; showroom and servicing facility in the town of Caterham adjacent to the railway station until February 2013. The Caterham dealership closed after the premises were sold for development and the showroom relocated to temporary facilities in Crawley. Additionally the &quot;Caterham Midlands&quot; showroom operates outside Leicester.

In 2012 elements of Caterham Cars moved into a new facility in Leafield, Oxfordshire, where it is expected the new models of cars to be produced in the future will be developed and built. This new facility was formerly used by the Arrows F1 team and the Super Aguri F1 team. The Leafield site also accommodated the Caterham F1 team, which moved from its original base in Hingham, Norfolk and competed in Formula One between the 2012 and 2014 seasons.

=== Caterham 21 ===


In 1994 Caterham produced a model called the &#x27;21&#x27;. Mechanically the 21 was very similar to the 7, using a modified 7 spaceframe chassis with a new GRP roadster-style body, including a wrap-around windscreen and fold-away fabric hood (convertible top) manufactured by Oxted Trimming Company.

The 21 benefited from a considerably stiffer setup than a 7, due to the work on the chassis and having a full body. Comfort was introduced in the same minimalist style as the 7, adding just enough to make it a proper roadster without adding too much weight.

Caterham, however, underestimated the effort involved in creating a completely new car and took far too long from its inception to deliver the first customer cars, seeing many people who had placed deposits defect to the Lotus Elise and other vehicles. Early ones were used as &quot;prototypes&quot;, leaving customers to help iron out some of the foibles of the new car.

The 21 never sold particularly well, with only 48 ever made. It had moderate racing success in the Belcar 24-hour series in Europe and is credited with helping Caterham develop the widetrack setup used in SVs (amongst other developments) and the CSR&#x27;s sweeping interior is reminiscent of the original 21 design.

=== Caterham SP/300.R ===
The SP/300.R is a new track-only model designed by Caterham alongside Lola Cars. The SP/300.R is a limited edition with limited production to 25 per annum.

=== Caterham Project V ===
== Caterham 7 model line-up ==


=== Chassis variants ===
In 2010 Caterham offered three different chassis variants in the UK.

==== Series 3 (S3) ====
The most popular variant retains the dimensions and layout of the Lotus 7 Series 3.

==== Series 5 (SV) ====
Caterham introduced this variant in 2000 to accommodate larger drivers (space is restricted in the S3 for drivers over tall.)
Although visually very similar to the S3, the SV is longer, taller and wider and has significantly more space for taller and broader drivers with the added benefits of more luggage space, a larger fuel tank and more stability. The SV chassis is heavier than the S3.

==== CSR (Series 6) ====
The CSR was launched in 2005 following extensive research and development by Caterham with the objective of creating an improved Seven. The CSR is based on the larger dimensions of the SV but with a substantially revised and stiffer chassis, inboard &#x27;pushrod&#x27; front suspensions, fully independent rear suspension, improved aerodynamics, potent Cosworth engines and a new &#x27;integrated&#x27; dashboard layout.

=== Model/trim variants ===

==== Classic ====
The most basic version of the 7 was traditionally offered with a &#x27;live&#x27; rear axle but now comes with De Dion tube rear suspension found in other models of the same range. This trim level strips away all non-essential equipment and comforts.

* Classic trim is available on S3/SV chassis
* Engines: 1.4-litre K-Series (105 bhp) or 1.6-litre K-Series (120 bhp).

==== Roadsport ====
Roadsport is the trim level intended for general usage, different weather conditions and touring. The spec includes a full windscreen and weather equipment to increase practicality. A large range of performance options are available. The Roadsport dates back to 1996 when it was called the Superlight R, in 1998 a much softer version came out called the Seven Clubsport 1.8. The range continued to be developed in the years as a great alternative to someone who wanted a little bit more than a Classic, but less than a Superlight.

* Classic trim is available on S3/SV chassis
* Engines: 1.6-litre Ford Sigma (120,125 or 150 bhp) or 2.0-litre Ford Duratec (175 bhp).

===== Roadsport A =====
Roadsport A cars are ex-Academy cars, with no engine upgrades. However a number of performance upgrades such removing the windscreens and lights, widetrack front suspension and uprated dampers are allowed, as is professional team support. RSA races at the same events as RSB, but has longer 30-minute races.

===== Roadsport B =====
Roadsport B is largely for drivers that have come through the previous season&#x27;s Academy. Some minor modifications are permitted to the car, including fitting a rear anti-roll bar and sticky Avon CR500 tyres. Technical support is still provided by the factory, and professional team support is not permitted. RSB has 20-minute races at 7 or 8 &#x27;double-header&#x27; meetings over the course of the season, usually all in the UK.

==== Superlight ====
The Superlight is intended for track and fast road usage. Superlight spec includes performance options such as carbon bodywork and a close ratio 6-speed gearbox. A wind deflector in place of the windscreen makes a helmet more or less mandatory. The Superlight R400 uses a 2.0 litre Ford Duratec engine tuned to . The R400 name indicates the car&#x27;s 400 bhp-per-tonne power-to-weight ratio.

* Superlight trim is available on S3/SV chassis
* Engines: 1.6-litre Ford Sigma (150 bhp) or 2.0-litre Ford Duratec (175 bhp, 210 bhp or 263 bhp).

===== Superlight R300 =====
The Superlight R300 was introduced for 2009, designed to bridge the gap between RSA and the existing Superlight R400 class. It is expected to be popular with experienced RSA racers wanting to move on to the next level in speed.

===== Superlight R400 =====
The Superlight R400 series is Caterham Motorsport&#x27;s premier British championship. The R400 is a 220 bhp Cosworth powered dedicated race car with a Quaife six-speed sequential gearbox replacing the standard Caterham unit used in the R300. As with all series above Academy, it runs on Avon CR500 tyres.

===== Superlight R500 =====
The Superlight R500 series is the latest of Caterham Motorsport&#x27;s Superlight series of RSA Racing cars. Powered by a 2.0-litre Ford Duratec engine producing maximum horsepower (bhp/rpm) of 263 bhp @ 8500rpm and maximum torque (lb.ft/rpm) of 177 lb.ft @ 7200rpm. With a weight of 506 kg (516 kg) and a sequential gearbox, it is capable of 0–60 mph in 2.88 seconds and a power-to-weight ratio of 520 bhp-per-tonne. Advertised top speed 150 mph. The R500 has been made &quot;Top Gear&quot; car of the year 2008. In another appearance earlier in the series, it placed fifth on the Power Lap board with a 1:17.9. This time beat the €1,100,000 (£899,000/$1,550,000), 1001 hp Bugatti Veyron.

===== Superlight R600 =====
In October 2012 a supercharged model for a race-series above the R300-class was released, including slick tyres and a sequential gearbox.

===== Superlight 620R =====
In September 2013 Caterham made a car called the 620R. It was based on the R500, but was supercharged. This increased the power output to at 7,700 rpm and the torque to at 7,350 rpm. It also reduced the 0– time to 2.79 seconds. It has a power-weight ratio of 568 bhp-per-tonne and a top speed of 155 mph.

==== CSR ====
The CSR chassis comes in two basic trims which mirror those of the S3/SV cars. The &#x27;basic&#x27; CSR has a road and touring oriented spec with full windscreen and weather equipment. This is available as the CSR200 (200 bhp) or CSR260 (260 bhp). The CSR Superlight (also 260 bhp) is the current Caterham performance flagship strips away the windscreen, integrated dash and other comfort-oriented components for maximum performance, with specialist &#x27;Dynamic dampers&#x27; added to improve its already phenomenal grip. The &#x27;basic&#x27; CSR set an unofficial time of 1.17.4 on the BBC Top Gear test track at Dunsfold, placing it ahead of many of the world&#x27;s most expensive performance cars.

* Engines: 2.3-litre Ford Duratec tuned by Cosworth (200 bhp or 260 bhp)

==== RS Performance RST-V8 engine ====
The &#x27;Caterham Levante&#x27;, built by RS Performance Engine Developments Ltd. (RS=Russell Savory), is a mostly-carbon-fibre bodied Caterham, with Kevlar seats, combined with an &quot;over 500bhp&quot; 2.4-litre, 40-valve supercharged V8 and a reduced body weight of , boasts almost per tonne (initial announced specifications were and , but the RS website specifies &quot;in excess of 500bhp,&quot; and or ; the math may or may not achieve &quot;over per tonne&quot;). The eight cars, costing £115,000, sold out and only eight will be produced to celebrate more than 50 years in production. Two days&#x27; of mandatory &quot;driver training&quot; are included in the price of the car.

=== Kit build ===
All of the 2008 model line-up is available as a &#x27;CKD&#x27; complete kit for build by the owner, with the exception of CSR models.

== Engines ==
Historically, engines have been supplied by Ford, specifically Ford Kent engines or Cosworth-derived race-prepared BDA/R units, enlarged to 1.7 litres and generating 150–170 bhp. In the early &#x27;90s, Caterham started using powerplants from other sources, with the least expensive models using 1.4-litre K series engines from MG Rover for the base model, and Vauxhall engines including full race versions of the 16 valve 2.0XE &quot;red top&quot; as fitted to 1990 Vauxhall Works Touring Cars. Rover engines span a power output of 110–250 bhp in the R500 Evolution, Vauxhall engines to in some factory built versions of the car. A Caterham JPE (Jonathan Palmer Evolution) briefly held the world record for production car 0–60 mph times (at 3.4 seconds) until it was bettered by the $1.2M McLaren F1.

The many aftermarket tuning companies for these cars have also offered the Ford Zetec, Honda Fireblade, Honda Blackbird, Suzuki Hayabusa and even the Mazda Rotary engine.
Since 2017, several cars have been built with the direct injection turbo Ford Ecoboost 1.6.litre version of this engine which with a hybrid turbo provides more horsepower than Caterham&#x27;s own supercharged Duratec, and more torque than any factory car including the V8 Levante.

In 2001, Caterham designated MG Rover the sole engine supplier for factory-built Sevens, with Ford Zetec, Honda Fireblade, Yamaha R1 and Suzuki Hayabusa engines still available for kit assembly. The Rover engines were based on the K series and carried the &#x27;Xpower&#x27; branding. However, the partnership evidently came to an end with the collapse of MG Rover, with the 2005 model introducing a Ford Duratec engine.

Typical powerplant output ranges from to over , depending on specifications and modifications.

The gearbox is either the classic Ford T9 five-speed or Caterham&#x27;s own six-speed box. The T9 is cheap and durable, but has gear ratios meant for a much heavier car. The six-speed gearbox is expensive and had early &#x27;teething&#x27; problems, but its ratios are considered the perfect match for the Seven. Independent companies such as Quaife do offer replacement gear kits for the T9 as well as sequential boxes for those with a racing fever and the need for a more robust transmission.

The most extreme engine/chassis combination available from the factory as of 2013 was the 620r with the 310bhp / 297Nm engine, bringing the car&#x27;s from zero to in 2.79 seconds. The previous model also held a production car world record for zero to back to zero at 10.73 seconds (faster than many modern family saloons can reach 60), set on 27 April 2004.

== Motor racing ==

=== Formula One ===
For the 2012 season, Team Lotus was officially renamed Caterham F1 Team. The team continued to compete under this name in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, before financial problems caused it to fold.

=== GP2 Series ===
Between 2012 and 2014, Caterham raced in the GP2 series, under the guise Caterham Racing, which was rebranded from the Caterham Air Asia team that raced in the 2011 season.

The team raced under the same Green and Yellow livery as the Formula 1 team.

Caterham Racing was used by the company to act as a feeder team towards developing racing drivers for the Caterham F1 Team, until the company had to cease operations in both series.

Initially based in Hingham, the team had moved to the Leafield Technical Centre alongside the Caterham F1 team in August 2012, where they remained until both teams were terminated in 2014.

==== Caterham Motorsport Ladder ====
The Caterham Motorsport Ladder is a progression through the various Caterham Cars championships, starting with the Caterham Academy, and moving through ultimately to their most prestigious European events. The championships which form the ladder are:

==== Caterham Academy ====
In 1995 the Caterham Academy, a novices-only format, was introduced in the UK as the Caterham Scholarship. For a starting price of £24,995 (2017), entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a car-control day, a test day, and the season starts with two sprints, and five circuit races.

Since 2000, the popularity of the Academy has led to Caterham providing two parallel Academy championships (Group 1 &amp; Group 2), each resulting in an Academy champion at the end of the year. Approximately 1000 racing drivers have been created through the Caterham Academy.

==== Karting ====
At the Autosport International 2012 Caterham announced that it would be creating a karting series starting in 2013. It was stated that the aim of this karting series was to make it easier for people to enter motorsports by providing a cheap karting series in which they could start off.

<text>Mark Brandt Dayton (born January 26, 1947) is an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Minnesota from 2011 to 2019. He served as a United States Senator representing Minnesota from 2001 to 2007 and as Minnesota State Auditor from 1991 to 1995. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), which affiliates with the national Democratic Party.

Dayton is the great-grandson of businessman George Dayton, the founder of Dayton&#x27;s, a department store that later became the Target Corporation. He embarked on a career in teaching and social work in New York City and Boston after graduating from Yale University in 1969. During the 1970s, he served as a legislative aide to U.S. Senator Walter Mondale and Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In 1978, Dayton was appointed the Minnesota Economic Development Commissioner and married Alida Rockefeller Messinger, a member of the Rockefeller family. Dayton ran for the U.S. Senate in 1982 against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised &quot;to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations—and if you think that includes the Daytons, you&#x27;re right.&quot; Durenberger won the election, and Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990.

In 1998, Dayton ran for governor, losing the Democratic nomination to Hubert Humphrey III. In 2000, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating Republican incumbent Rod Grams. As senator, Dayton voted against the authorization for Iraq War, and became the first senator to introduce legislation creating a cabinet-level United States Department of Peace. In 2006, he chose not to seek reelection, citing his disillusionment with Washington, D.C., and fundraising.

In 2010, Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer to become governor of Minnesota despite national success for the Republican Party, including in the Minnesota legislature. He won a second term in 2014 over Republican opponent Jeff Johnson and opted not to run for a third term in 2018. His major legislative initiatives during his governorship include the legalization of same-sex marriage and the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium.

==Early life, education, and career==
Dayton was born on January 26, 1947, in Minneapolis and is the eldest of Gwendolen May (Brandt) and Bruce Bliss Dayton&#x27;s four children. He is a great-grandson of businessman George Dayton, the founder of the Dayton&#x27;s department store chain. His father, Bruce Dayton, served as the chairman and CEO of Dayton Hudson Corporation, the company that later became the Target Corporation. Bruce Dayton also founded the B. Dalton bookstore chain in 1966.

Mark Dayton was raised in Long Lake, Minnesota, and graduated from the Blake School in Minneapolis, where he was an all-state ice-hockey goaltender as a senior.

Dayton attended Yale University, where he played varsity hockey until an accident on the ice. During his time at Yale, he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (alongside future President George W. Bush) and received his B.A. in psychology in 1969. After college, Dayton worked as teacher in the Lower East Side of New York City from 1969 to 1971, and then as the chief financial officer of a social service agency in Boston from 1971 to 1975. He married his first wife, Alida Rockefeller, in 1978.

==Early political career and U.S. Senate==
Dayton first became politically active in the 1960s. He protested the Vietnam War in April 1970 at one of Minnesota&#x27;s major antiwar protests against Honeywell, where he was maced by police. Dayton&#x27;s father served on the Honeywell board of directors and the two had a strained relationship after the incident.

From 1975 to 1976 he was a legislative aide to Senator Walter Mondale, until Mondale&#x27;s election as Vice President of the United States. From 1977 to 1978, Dayton served as an aide to Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In 1978, Perpich appointed Dayton to head the Department of Economic Development and then the Department of Energy and Economic Development.

Dayton first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1982, challenging Republican incumbent David Durenberger. After losing the election to Durenberger, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990; he served in that position until 1995.

In 1998, Dayton ran for governor, losing the DFL nomination to Hubert Humphrey III. He received 18% of the vote, finishing fourth in the DFL primary. Humphrey lost the general election to the Reform Party nominee, Jesse Ventura.

In 2000, Dayton was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating Republican incumbent Rod Grams, 49% to 43%.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

Dayton first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1982, challenging Republican incumbent David Durenberger and former U.S. senator Eugene McCarthy in the DFL primary. McCarthy&#x27;s reputation was harmed by his endorsement of Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election; Dayton defeated him with over 69% of the vote. The general election was one of the most expensive in state history. Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised &quot;to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations—and if you think that includes the Daytons, you&#x27;re right.&quot; Durenberger, who was considered a moderate but had supported Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts, won the election, 52% to 46%.

Dayton ran for the Senate again in 2000. He won the DFL nomination with 41% of the vote in a six-candidate field, and defeated Republican incumbent Rod Grams in the general election, 49% to 43%. Dayton self-financed his campaign with $12 million.

===Tenure===
As senator, Dayton voted against the authorization for Iraq War, and was the first senator to introduce legislation creating a cabinet-level United States Department of Peace.

While in the Senate, Dayton donated his salary to fund bus trips for seniors to buy cheaper prescription drugs in Canada. He generally voted with his fellow Democrats.

On February 9, 2005, he announced that he would not run for reelection, saying, &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve worked for, and everything I believe in, depends upon this Senate seat remaining in the Democratic caucus in 2007. I do not believe that I am the best candidate to lead the DFL Party to victory next year.&quot; He also cited his dislike of fundraising and political campaigns. Dayton was succeeded in the Senate by Amy Klobuchar, another DFL member.

On September 22, 2005, the 44th anniversary of the day President John F. Kennedy signed the Peace Corps into law, Dayton became the first U.S. senator to introduce legislation creating a cabinet-level Department of Peace. At the same time, Representative Dennis Kucinich introduced similar legislation in the House.

In April 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine rated Dayton one of America&#x27;s &quot;Five Worst Senators&quot;, calling him &quot;The Blunderer&quot; for such &quot;erratic behavior&quot; as his temporary closure of his office in 2004 because of an unspecified terrorist threat, his complaints about &quot;limited power in a chamber where authority derives from seniority&quot;, and a February 2005 comment that the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was &quot;worth a hell of a lot more than the whole state of South Dakota&quot;, a remark he later apologized for. News reports of a Dayton question-and-answer session quoted him giving himself an F grade for his time in the Senate. Largely based on his Washington behavior, &quot;The New Republic&quot; dubbed Dayton&#x27;s subsequent run for state-level elected office &quot;Eeyore For Governor.&quot;

In September 2006, Dayton requested a review of the Rogers, Minnesota, tornado to determine whether the National Weather Service had acted properly and the victims&#x27; deaths were unavoidable.

=== &quot;Office of Senator Mark Dayton v. Brad Hanson&quot; ===

The 2003 lawsuit &quot;Office of Senator Mark Dayton v. Brad Hanson&quot; involved an accusation of wrongful termination by Brad Hanson, who worked as State Office Manager for Dayton, and who was fired shortly after taking medical leave for a heart problem. Hanson sued under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, claiming that Dayton had discriminated against him because of a perceived disability. Dayton argued that he was immunized from suit by the speech or debate clause of the United States Constitution. Dayton claimed that Hanson&#x27;s duties were directly related to Dayton&#x27;s legislative functions, and that the decision to fire him could not be challenged. The District Court denied the motion, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, where oral arguments were heard on April 24, 2007. The Supreme Court ruled 8–0 that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal and dismissed the case, declining to grant certiorari. Dayton reached a settlement with Hanson in 2009, shortly after Dayton became a candidate for governor.

==Governor of Minnesota==

=== Elections ===

On January 16, 2009, Dayton announced his candidacy for Governor of Minnesota. In a crowded Democratic field of challengers, Dayton chose to bypass the state caucuses and convention in favor of the primary election. He stated he made that decision because the primary election is a more democratic method of choosing a candidate. He relied on personal funds for his campaign. On May 24, 2010, he announced State Senator Yvonne Prettner Solon of Duluth as his running mate for lieutenant governor. On August 10, 2010, Dayton defeated the DFL-endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher in the primary election by 1,500 votes, 41.33% to 39.75%, in what was called a &quot;remarkable political comeback&quot;. He was later endorsed by the Minnesota DFL to earn his party&#x27;s nomination for governor.

At the close of balloting in the general election on November 2, 2010, Dayton led his Republican opponent, Tom Emmer, by just under 9,000 votes. The margin of victory was small enough to trigger an automatic recount under state law. Analysts generally thought it unlikely that Dayton&#x27;s lead would be overturned. During the hand recount of ballots, Emmer failed to find enough questionable ballots to overturn Dayton&#x27;s lead. Emmer conceded the election on December 8, 2010. Minnesota Independence Party candidate Tom Horner received 11.9% of the vote, and it has been suggested that Horner cost Emmer the election by splitting the vote.

Ahead of the 2014 gubernatorial election, Lieutenant Governor Prettner Solon chose to retire. Dayton replaced her with longtime political staffer Tina Smith, who had been Dayton&#x27;s chief of staff. Dayton defeated Republican nominee Jeff Johnson, 50.1% to 44.5%, the first time since 1994 that the winning Minnesota gubernatorial candidate received a majority of the vote.

===Tenure===
Dayton took the oath of office to become governor on January 3, 2011. Taking office a few weeks before his 64th birthday, he was the oldest person ever inaugurated as governor in Minnesota history. Former Vice President and Senator Walter Mondale served as Master of Ceremonies at the inauguration. The first DFLer to serve as governor in 20 years, Dayton succeeded Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. On January 5, Dayton signed two executive orders allowing the Minnesota Departments of Commerce and Health to apply for federal health-care grants and providing $1.2 billion in federal funds for an Early Option in a statewide Medicaid Opt-In program. These executive orders reversed the previous administration&#x27;s ban on federal funding for the state health-care system. In March 2011, Dayton signed a law increasing penalties on those who injure or kill police dogs.

On July 1, 2011, the Minnesota government went into a shutdown as a result of an impasse during budget negotiations between Dayton and the Republican-led legislature. On July 20, Dayton and the legislature reached an agreement, ending the shutdown.

Dayton led an effort to have a new stadium constructed for the Minnesota Vikings. In May 2011, after efforts to have the stadium financed by Hennepin County failed, Ramsey County officials announced they had reached an agreement with the Vikings to be the team&#x27;s local partner for a new stadium, subject to approval by the Minnesota Legislature and to approval of a sales tax by the Ramsey County Board. Dayton was reluctant to go along with the team&#x27;s Arden Hills proposal because it would cost $1.1 billion, including an additional $131 million for road improvements, and later tried to have the stadium built on the site of the farmers&#x27; market near Linden Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. On March 1, 2012, plans to build the stadium in either Arden Hills or at the Linden Avenue site were abandoned after Dayton announced an agreement for a new stadium to be built on the site of the Metrodome, pending approval by the state legislature and the Minneapolis City Council. In May 2012, the proposal to build the stadium on the Metrodome site was passed by the Minnesota Legislature and was signed into law by Dayton. On May 25, the proposal was officially finalized after receiving the Minneapolis City Council&#x27;s approval.

In 2012, Dayton commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Dakota War of 1862 with a call for reconciliation, and repudiation of former governor Alexander Ramsey&#x27;s position. Flags were flown at half mast for a &quot;Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation in Minnesota&quot;.

In the legislative session that ended in May 2013, Dayton pushed for and won a $2.1 billion tax increase, mostly on the wealthy and cigarettes. He also signed a bill legalizing gay marriage in Minnesota, created free, statewide, all-day kindergarten, and financed expansions of the Mayo Clinic, 3M, and the Mall of America. In the spring 2014 session, Dayton came under fire from supporters and foes alike for opposing the legalization of medical marijuana, which polls showed 65% of Minnesotans supported. One supporter, the mother of a child with severe epilepsy, alleged Dayton told her in a meeting that he would not legalize the drug but she could buy it illegally instead. Dayton denied saying that. On April 2, Marijuana Policy Project began airing an ad across the state attacking Dayton&#x27;s opposition to medical marijuana legalization, featuring a St. Paul mother and her child whose severe seizures could be cured by medical marijuana.

On December 6, 2017, Politico reported that Dayton was expected to appoint Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith to Al Franken&#x27;s Senate seat if Franken resigned amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him. Franken resigned on January 2, 2018, and Dayton then appointed Smith to the seat.

==Political positions==

As of 2010, Dayton received 100% ratings from the AFL–CIO, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and Americans for Democratic Action. He received a 79% rating from the League of Conservation Voters for his support of green energy as of 2010. In 2005, Dayton scored a 9% rating from the Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council.

===Healthcare===
Dayton supports health-care coverage for all Americans, with increased state and federal spending on health care. He supports a progressive tax to decrease state and federal deficits. To create jobs, he proposed a state stimulus package as part of his gubernatorial platform. Dayton supports increased funding for K–12 schools, with increased teachers&#x27; salaries and decreased class size.

In July 2000, Dayton answered an election questionnaire saying he would expand Medicare prescription-drug coverage. He favors keeping Social Security intact, opposing its privatization. He received a 90% rating from the Alliance for Retired Americans.

===Medical marijuana===
Until 2013, Dayton opposed the legalization of medical cannabis and drug policy reform, adopting the same position as his Republican predecessor Tim Pawlenty. The Marijuana Policy Project called Dayton &quot;no more favorable&quot; to drug policy reform than the last Republican governor. When Dayton posed a $2 million study on medical marijuana with the Mayo Clinic instead of signing a bill to legalize medical marijuana, advocates &quot;bashed&quot; Dayton for not allowing suffering patients to have access to the drug. City Pages reported that the Governor could lose the vote of the many supporters of medical marijuana, 65% of Minnesotans, to the 3/5 of Republican candidates for governor in 2014 who &quot;strike a more liberal tone on marijuana reform&quot; than the Democratic incumbent.

===Same-sex marriage===
With Senator Joe Lieberman and Representative Barney Frank, Dayton introduced legislation to the Governmental Affairs Committee to extend domestic partners of federal employees all benefits available and obligations imposed upon a spouse of an employee. Dayton voted against a constitutional ban of same-sex marriage in June 2006, and supported civil marriage equality in his gubernatorial platform. On May 14, 2013, Governor Dayton signed into law a bill passed by the Minnesota House and Senate to legalize same-sex marriage in the state.

===Iraq War===
In October 2002, Dayton voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. He followed up three years later by introducing Senate Bill 1756 to create a cabinet-level Department of Peace a week after Dennis Kucinich introduced a similar bill in the House. The bill never emerged from the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

==Personal life==
Dayton was born into one of Minnesota&#x27;s most famous families. His father built the family business into a retail empire.

Dayton found his political calling while studying pre-med at Yale University, after his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated. Dayton soon began his career in public service. In the 1970s, his political activism earned him a spot as the only Minnesotan on Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;enemies list&quot;, a fact he cited in future campaign speeches. In a 1982 race, Dayton called his wealth his &quot;original sin&quot; and promised to close tax loopholes for corporations and the rich.

Dayton has been married three times. In 1978, he married Alida Ferry Rockefeller, at the Rockefeller home in Tarrytown, New York. Alida is the youngest sister of former U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller. Together they had two sons, Eric and Andrew. They divorced in 1986.

Despite his wealth, Dayton lives modestly. He is a recovering alcoholic and has been treated for mild depression. He revealed this information on his own initiative, saying he felt &quot;people have the right to know.&quot;

In December 2012, Dayton underwent vertebral fusion surgery at the Mayo Clinic to treat his spinal stenosis. On June 25, 2013, he had to cancel an appearance due to a muscle tear. In January 2016, Dayton fainted while speaking at a campaign event in Woodbury, Minnesota. He was hospitalized overnight. A year later, he collapsed while giving the State of the State address to the Minnesota legislature. After a check by emergency medical services, he was reported to be in fine condition and was sent home that evening. The next day he announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a week earlier.

On October 8, 2019, the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Center for Integrative Leadership announced that Dayton had joined the center as an Executive Leadership Fellow for the 2019–2020 academic year.

In December 2020, Dayton married former congressional intern and campaign staffer Ana Orke. He first met her at a 2005 political fundraiser when he was in the U.S. Senate.

<text>Virginia Apgar (June 7, 1909August 7, 1974) was an American physician, obstetrical anesthesiologist and medical researcher, best known as the inventor of the Apgar score, a way to quickly assess the health of a newborn child immediately after birth in order to combat infant mortality. In 1952, she developed the 10-point Apgar score to assist physicians and nurses in assessing the status of newborns. Given at one minute and five minutes after birth, the Apgar test measures a child&#x27;s breathing, skin color, reflexes, motion, and heart rate. A friend said, &quot;She probably did more than any other physician to bring the problem of birth defects out of back rooms.&quot; She was a leader in the fields of anesthesiology and teratology, and introduced obstetrical considerations to the established field of neonatology.

== Early life and education ==

The youngest of three children, Apgar was born and raised in Westfield, New Jersey, the daughter of Helen May (Clarke) and Charles Emory Apgar. Her father was a business executive and amateur astronomer whose amateur radio work exposed an espionage ring during World War I. Her older brother died early from tuberculosis, and her other brother had a chronic illness. She graduated from Westfield High School in 1925, knowing that she wanted to be a doctor from a young age.
Apgar graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1929, where she studied zoology with minors in physiology and chemistry. In 1933, she graduated fourth in her class from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&amp;S) and completed a residency in surgery at P&amp;S in 1937.

She was discouraged by Allen Whipple, the chairman of surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, from continuing her career as a surgeon because he had seen many women attempt to be successful surgeons and ultimately fail. He instead encouraged her to practice anesthesiology because he felt that advancements in anesthesia were needed to further advance surgery and felt that she had the &quot;energy and ability&quot; to make a significant contribution. Deciding to continue her career in anesthesiology, she trained for six months under Ralph Waters at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he had established the first anesthesiology department in the United States. In a 1937 photograph of Waters and his residents, she is the only woman among Waters and fifteen other men. She then studied for a further six months under Emery Rovenstine in New York at Bellevue Hospital. She received a certification as an anesthesiologist in 1937, and returned to P&amp;S in 1938 as director of the newly formed division of anesthesia. She later received a master&#x27;s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, graduating in 1959.

== Work and research ==

Apgar was the first woman to head a specialty division at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (now NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital) and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In conjunction with Allen Whipple, she started P&amp;S&#x27;s anesthesia division. She was placed in charge of the division&#x27;s administrative duties and was also tasked with co-ordinating the staffing of the division and its work throughout the hospital. Throughout much of the 1940s, she was an administrator, teacher, recruiter, coordinator and practicing physician.

It was often difficult to find residents for the program, as advances in the medical field had only recently elevated the practice of anesthesia to anesthesiology, a fully-fledged medical specialty. New anesthesiologists also faced scrutiny from other physicians, specifically surgeons, who were not used to having an anesthesia-specialized in the operating room. These difficulties led to issues in gaining funding and support for the division. With America&#x27;s entrance into World War II in 1941, many medical professionals enlisted in the military to help the war effort, which created a serious staffing problem for domestic hospitals, Apgar&#x27;s division included.

When the war ended in 1945, interest in anesthesiology was renewed in returning physicians, and the staffing problem for Apgar&#x27;s division was quickly resolved. The specialty&#x27;s growing popularity and Apgar&#x27;s development of its residency program prompted P&amp;S to establish it as an official department in 1949. Due to her lack of research (because of her focus on clinical work), Apgar was not made the head of the department as was expected and the job was given to her colleague, Emmanuel Papper. Apgar was given a faculty position at P&amp;S.

=== Obstetrics ===

In 1949, Apgar became the first woman to become a full professor at P&amp;S, where she remained until 1959. During this time, she also did clinical and research work at the affiliated Sloane Hospital for Women, still a division of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. In 1953, she introduced the first test, called the Apgar score, to assess the health of newborn babies.

Between the 1930s and the 1950s, the United States infant mortality rate decreased, but the number of infant deaths within the first 24 hours after birth remained constant. Apgar noticed this trend and began to investigate methods for decreasing the infant mortality rate specifically within the first 24 hours of the infant&#x27;s life. As an obstetric anesthesiologist, Apgar was able to document trends that could distinguish healthy infants from infants in trouble.

This investigation led to a standardized scoring system used to assess a newborn&#x27;s health after birth, with the result referred to as the newborn&#x27;s &quot;Apgar score&quot;. Each newborn is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 (a score of 2 meaning the newborn is in optimal condition, 0 being in distress) in each of the following categories: heart rate, respiration, color, muscle tone and reflex irritability. Compiled scores for each newborn can range between 0 and 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn&#x27;s condition did not sufficiently improve. By the 1960s, many hospitals in the United States were using the Apgar score consistently. In the 21st century, the score continues to be used to provide an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth .

In 1959, Apgar left Columbia and earned a Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. From 1959 until her death in 1974, Apgar worked for the March of Dimes Foundation, serving as vice president for medical affairs and directing its research program to prevent and treat birth defects.

As gestational age is directly related to an infant&#x27;s Apgar score, Apgar was one of the first at the March of Dimes to bring attention to the problem of premature birth, now one of the March of Dimes&#x27; top priorities. During this time, she wrote and lectured extensively, writing articles in popular magazines as well as research work. In 1967, Apgar became vice president and director of basic research at The National Foundation-March of Dimes.

During the rubella pandemic of 1964–65, Apgar became an advocate for universal vaccination to prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella. Rubella can cause serious congenital disorders if a woman becomes infected while pregnant. Between 1964 and 1965, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases, which led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. These led to 2,100 deaths in infancy, 12,000 cases of deafness, 3,580 cases of blindness due to cataracts and/or microphthalmia and 1,800 cases of intellectual disability. In New York City alone, congenital rubella affected 1% of all babies born at that time.

Apgar also promoted effective use of Rh testing, which can identify women who are at risk for transmission of maternal antibodies across the placenta where they may subsequently bind with and destroy fetal red blood cells, resulting in fetal hydrops or even miscarriage.

Apgar traveled thousands of miles each year to speak to widely varied audiences about the importance of early detection of birth defects and the need for more research in this area. She proved an excellent ambassador for the National Foundation, and the annual income of that organization more than doubled during her tenure there. She also served the National Foundation as Director of Basic Medical Research (1967–1968) and vice-president for Medical Affairs (1971–1974). Her concerns for the welfare of children and families were combined with her talent for teaching in the 1972 book &quot;Is My Baby All Right?&quot;, written with Joan Beck.
Apgar was also a lecturer (1965–1971) and then clinical professor (1971–1974) of pediatrics at Cornell University School of Medicine, where she taught teratology (the study of birth defects). She was the first to hold a faculty position in this new area of pediatrics. In 1973, she was appointed a lecturer in medical genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

Apgar published over sixty scientific articles and numerous shorter essays for newspapers and magazines during her career, along with her book, &quot;Is My Baby All Right?&quot;. She received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the Woman&#x27;s Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) and Mount Holyoke College (1965), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from the American Medical Women&#x27;s Association (1966), the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966), the Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973) and the Ralph M. Waters Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1973). In 1973 she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;.

Apgar was equally at home speaking to teens as she was to the movers and shakers of society. She spoke at March of Dimes Youth Conferences about teen pregnancy and congenital disorders at a time when these topics were considered taboo.

== Personal life ==
Throughout her career, Apgar maintained that &quot;women are liberated from the time they leave the womb&quot; and that being female had not imposed significant limitations on her medical career. She avoided women&#x27;s organizations and causes, for the most part. Though she sometimes privately expressed her frustration with sex inequalities (especially in the matter of salaries), she worked around these by consistently pushing into new fields where there was room to exercise her considerable energy and abilities.

Music was an integral part of family life, with frequent family music sessions. Apgar played the violin and her brother played piano and organ. She traveled with her violin, often playing in amateur chamber quartets wherever she happened to be. During the 1950s, a friend introduced her to instrument-making, and together they made two violins, a viola and a cello. She was an enthusiastic gardener and enjoyed fly-fishing, golfing and stamp collecting. In her fifties, Apgar started taking flying lessons, stating that her goal was to someday fly under New York&#x27;s George Washington Bridge.

=== Death ===

Apgar never married or had children and died of cirrhosis on August 7, 1974, at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She is buried at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield.

== Legacy ==

Apgar has continued to earn posthumous recognition for her contributions and achievements.

<doc id="250259" wikidata="Q1783115" url="?curid=250259" title="Queue area">
<text>Queue areas are places in which people queue (first-come, first-served) for goods or services. Such a group of people is known as a &quot;queue&quot; (British usage) or &quot;line&quot; (American usage), and the people are said to be waiting or standing &quot;in a queue&quot; or &quot;in line&quot;, respectively. (In the New York City area, the phrase &quot;on line&quot; is often used in place of &quot;in line&quot;.) Occasionally, both the British and American terms are combined to form the term &quot;queue line&quot;.

Examples include checking out groceries or other goods that have been collected in a self service shop, in a shop without self-service, at an ATM, at a ticket desk, a city bus, or in a taxi stand.

Queueing is a phenomenon in a number of fields, and has been extensively analysed in the study of queueing theory. In economics, queueing is seen as one way to ration scarce goods and services.

==Types==

===Physical===

====History====

The first written description of people standing in line is found in an 1837 book, &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot; by Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle described what he thought was a strange sight: people standing in an orderly line to buy bread from bakers around Paris.

====Typical applications====

Queues can be found in railway stations to book tickets, at bus stops for boarding and at temples.

Queues are generally found at transportation terminals where security screenings are conducted.

Large stores and supermarkets may have dozens of separate queues, but this can cause frustration, as different lines tend to be handled at different speeds; some people are served quickly, while others may wait for longer periods of time. Sometimes two people who are together split up and each waits in a different line; once it is determined which line is faster, the one in the slower line joins the other. Another arrangement is for everyone to wait in a single line; a person leaves the line each time a service point opens up. This is a common setup in banks and post offices.

Organized queue areas are commonly found at amusement parks. Each ride can accommodate a fixed number of guests that can be served at any given time (which is referred to as the ride’s operational capacity), so there has to be some control over additional guests who are waiting. This led to the development of formalized queue areas—areas in which the lines of people waiting to board the rides are organized by railings, and may be given shelter from the elements with a roof over their heads, inside a climate-controlled building or with fans and misting devices. In some amusement parks – Disney theme parks being a prime example – queue areas can be elaborately decorated, with holding areas fostering anticipation, thus shortening the perceived wait for people in the queue by giving them something interesting to look at as they wait, or the perception that they have arrived at the threshold of the attraction.

====Design====

When designing queues, planners attempt to make the wait as pleasant and as simple as possible. They employ several strategies to achieve this, including:
* Expanding the capacity of the queue, thus allowing more patrons to have a place. This can be achieved by:
** Increasing the width of the lanes within the queue
** Increasing the length of the queue, sometimes by designing the line in a zig-zag shape that holds a large number of guests in a smaller area. This is used often at amusement parks. Notable rides have a large area of this kind of line to hold as many people as possible in line. Portions of the line can be sectioned off and bypassed by guests if the queue is not crowded.
* In-line entertainment can be added. This is popular at amusement parks like Walt Disney World, which uses video screens and other visuals to keep people in the queue area occupied.
* Secondary queue areas for patrons with special tickets, like the FastPass system used at Disney parks, or the Q-bot as used in Legoland Windsor.

====Psychology====
People experience &quot;occupied&quot; time as shorter than &quot;unoccupied&quot; time, and generally overestimate the amount of time waited by around 36%.

The technique of giving people an activity to distract them from a wait has been used to reduce complaints of delays at:
* Baggage claim in the Houston, Texas airport, by moving the arrival gates further away so passengers spend more time walking than standing around waiting
* Elevators, by adding mirrors so people can groom themselves or watch other people
* Retail checkout, by placing small items for purchase so customers can continue shopping while waiting

Other techniques to reduce queueing anxiety include:
* Hiding the length of a line by wrapping it around a corner.
* Having only one line, so there is no anxiety about which line to choose and a greater sense of fairness. Even though the average wait over time is the same, customers tend to notice lines that are moving faster than they are compared to other lines moving more slowly.
* Putting up signs that deliberately overestimate the wait time, to always exceed customer expectations.

Cutting in line, also known as queue-jumping, can generate a strong negative response, depending on the local cultural norms.

=== Virtual ===

Physical queueing is sometimes replaced by virtual queueing. In a waiting room there may be a system whereby the queuer asks and remembers where their place is in the queue, or reports to a desk and signs in, or takes a ticket with a number from a machine. These queues typically are found at doctors&#x27; offices, hospitals, town halls, social security offices, labor exchanges, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the immigration departments, free internet access in the state or council libraries, banks or post offices and call centres. Especially in the United Kingdom, tickets are taken to form a virtual queue at delicatessens and children&#x27;s shoe shops. In some countries such as Sweden, virtual queues are also common in shops and railway stations. A display sometimes shows the number that was last called for service.

Restaurants have come to employ virtual queueing techniques with the availability of application-specific pagers, which alert those waiting that they should report to the host to be seated. Another option used at restaurants is to assign customers a confirmed return time, basically a reservation issued on arrival.

Virtual queueing apps are available that allow the customers to view the virtual queue status of a business and they can take virtual queue numbers remotely. The app can be used to get updates of the virtual queue status that the customer is in.

==== Alternate activities ====
A substitute or alternative activity may be provided for people to participate in while waiting to be called, which reduces the perceived waiting time and the probability that the customer will abort their visit. For example, a busy restaurant might seat waiting customers a bar. An outdoor attraction with long virtual queues might have a side marquee selling merchandise or food. The alternate activity may provide the organisation with an opportunity to generate additional revenue from the waiting customers.

=== Mobile ===
All of the above methods, however, suffer from the same drawback: the person arrives at the location only to find out that they need to wait. Recently, queues at DMVs, colleges, restaurants, healthcare institutions, government offices and elsewhere have begun to be replaced by mobile queues or queue-ahead, whereby the person queuing uses their phone, the internet, a kiosk or another method to enter a virtual queue, optionally prior to arrival, is free to roam during the wait, and then gets paged at their mobile phone when their turn approaches. This has the advantage of allowing users to find out the wait forecast and get in the queue before arriving, roaming freely and then timing their arrival to the availability of service. This has been shown to extend the patience of those in the queue and reduce no-shows.

<text>A monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionary (MLD) is designed to meet the reference needs of people learning a foreign language. MLDs are based on the premise that language-learners should progress from a bilingual dictionary to a monolingual one as they become more proficient in their target language, but that general-purpose dictionaries (aimed at native speakers) are inappropriate for their needs. Dictionaries for learners include information on grammar, usage, common errors, collocation, and pragmatics, which is largely missing from standard dictionaries, because native speakers tend to know these aspects of language intuitively. And while the definitions in standard dictionaries are often written in difficult language, those in an MLD use a simple and accessible defining vocabulary.

==History of English language MLDs==
The first English MLD, published in 1935, was the &quot;New Method English Dictionary&quot; by Michael West and James Endicott, a small dictionary using a restricted defining vocabulary of just 1490 words. Since the end of World War Two, global sales of the MLD have run into the tens of millions, reflecting the boom in the English language teaching industry.

Probably the best-known English monolingual dictionary for advanced learners is the &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, now in its tenth edition. It was originally published in Japan in 1942 as &quot;The Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary of English&quot;, written by A. S. Hornby and two collaborators. It was subsequently republished as &quot;A Learner&#x27;s Dictionary of Current English&quot; in 1948, before acquiring its current name.

Other publishers gradually entered the market. The &quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&quot; was published in 1978, and its most striking feature was the use of a restricted defining vocabulary, which is now a standard feature of learners&#x27; dictionaries. There are currently six major MLDs for advanced learners. In addition to the Oxford and Longman dictionaries, these are:
*&quot;Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary&quot;, first published in 1987
*&quot;Cambridge International Dictionary of English&quot;, 1995, now published as the &quot;Cambridge Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;
*&quot;Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners&quot;, 2002
*&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Advanced Learner&#x27;s English Dictionary&quot;, 2008
All of these dictionaries are available in hard copy and online.

Since the 1980s, the English MLD has, arguably, been the most innovative area in the field of lexicography, in terms of both the way dictionaries are written and the aspects of language which dictionaries describe, in particular the use of software in combination with text corpora to:
*generate language description - a radical innovation which was introduced by the COBUILD project in the 1980s
*automate the dictionary-making process
*identify collocations

MLDs were among the first dictionaries to appear on CD-ROM, with the &quot;Longman Interactive English Dictionary&quot; leading the way in 1993. More recently the six MLDs listed above have become available in free online versions.

MLDs have been the subject of research into how people use dictionaries, as well as the subject of scholarly work. A standard book on the subject is Cowie 1999.

==Online dictionaries==
The Internet offers a range of online dictionary resources. Some, like the Open Dictionary of English, are explicitly designed as learner&#x27;s dictionaries, and may even include built-in, adaptive tutoring.

<text>In navigation, a rhumb line, rhumb (), or loxodrome is an arc crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, that is, a path with constant azimuth (bearing as measured relative to true north).
Navigation on a fixed course (i.e., steering the vessel to follow a constant cardinal direction) would result in a rhumb-line track.

==Introduction==
The effect of following a rhumb line course on the surface of a globe was first discussed by the Portuguese mathematician Pedro Nunes in 1537, in his &quot;Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart&quot;, with further mathematical development by Thomas Harriot in the 1590s.

A rhumb line can be contrasted with a great circle, which is the path of shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. On a great circle, the bearing to the destination point does not remain constant. If one were to drive a car along a great circle one would hold the steering wheel fixed, but to follow a rhumb line one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached. In other words, a great circle is locally &quot;straight&quot; with zero geodesic curvature, whereas a rhumb line has non-zero geodesic curvature.

Meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude provide special cases of the rhumb line, where their angles of intersection are respectively 0° and 90°. On a north–south passage the rhumb line course coincides with a great circle, as it does on an east–west passage along the equator.

On a Mercator projection map, any rhumb line is a straight line; a rhumb line can be drawn on such a map between any two points on Earth without going off the edge of the map. But theoretically a loxodrome can extend beyond the right edge of the map, where it then continues at the left edge with the same slope (assuming that the map covers exactly 360 degrees of longitude).

Rhumb lines which cut meridians at oblique angles are loxodromic curves which spiral towards the poles. On a Mercator projection the North Pole and South Pole occur at infinity and are therefore never shown. However the full loxodrome on an infinitely high map would consist of infinitely many line segments between the two edges. On a stereographic projection map, a loxodrome is an equiangular spiral whose center is the north or south pole.

All loxodromes spiral from one pole to the other. Near the poles, they are close to being logarithmic spirals (which they are exactly on a stereographic projection, see below), so they wind around each pole an infinite number of times but reach the pole in a finite distance. The pole-to-pole length of a loxodrome (assuming a perfect sphere) is the length of the meridian divided by the cosine of the bearing away from true north. Loxodromes are not defined at the poles.

==Etymology and historical description==
The word &quot;loxodrome&quot; comes from Ancient Greek λοξός &quot;loxós&quot;: &quot;oblique&quot; + δρόμος &quot;drómos&quot;: &quot;running&quot; (from δραμεῖν &quot;drameîn&quot;: &quot;to run&quot;). The word &quot;rhumb&quot; may come from Spanish or Portuguese &quot;rumbo/rumo&quot; (&quot;course&quot; or &quot;direction&quot;) and Greek ῥόμβος &quot;rhómbos&quot;, from &quot;rhémbein&quot;.

The 1878 edition of &quot;The Globe Encyclopaedia of Universal Information&quot; describes a &quot;loxodrome line&quot; as:

Loxodrom′ic Line is a curve which cuts every member of a system of lines of curvature of a given surface at the same angle. A ship sailing towards the same point of the compass describes such a line which cuts all the meridians at the same angle. In Mercator&#x27;s Projection (q.v.) the Loxodromic lines are evidently straight.

A misunderstanding could arise because the term &quot;rhumb&quot; had no precise meaning when it came into use. It applied equally well to the windrose lines as it did to loxodromes because the term only applied &quot;locally&quot; and only meant whatever a sailor did in order to sail with constant bearing, with all the imprecision that that implies. Therefore, &quot;rhumb&quot; was applicable to the straight lines on portolans when portolans were in use, as well as always applicable to straight lines on Mercator charts. For short distances portolan &quot;rhumbs&quot; do not meaningfully differ from Mercator rhumbs, but these days &quot;rhumb&quot; is synonymous with the mathematically precise &quot;loxodrome&quot; because it has been made synonymous retrospectively.
As Leo Bagrow states:
the word (&#x27;Rhumbline&#x27;) is wrongly applied to the sea-charts of this period, since a loxodrome gives an accurate course only when the chart is drawn on a suitable projection. Cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in the early charts, for which we therefore retain the name &#x27;portolan&#x27;.

==Mathematical description==
For a sphere of radius 1, the azimuthal angle , the polar angle (defined here to correspond to latitude), and Cartesian unit vectors , , and can be used to write the radius vector as

:formula_1

Orthogonal unit vectors in the azimuthal and polar directions of the sphere can be written

:formula_2

which have the scalar products

:formula_3

 for constant traces out a parallel of latitude, while for constant traces out a meridian of longitude, and together they generate a plane tangent to the sphere.

The unit vector
:formula_4
has a constant angle with the unit vector for any and , since their scalar product is

:formula_5

A loxodrome is defined as a curve on the sphere that has a constant angle with all meridians of longitude, and therefore must be parallel to the unit vector . As a result, a differential length along the loxodrome will produce a differential displacement

:formula_6

where formula_7 and formula_8 are the Gudermannian function and its inverse, formula_9 formula_10 and formula_11 is the inverse hyperbolic sine.

With this relationship between and , the radius vector becomes a parametric function of one variable, tracing out the loxodrome on the sphere:

:formula_12

where

:formula_13

is the isometric latitude.

In the Rhumb line, as the latitude tends to the poles, , , the isometric latitude , and longitude increases without bound, circling the sphere ever so fast in a spiral towards the pole, while tending to a finite total arc length Δ given by
:formula_14

===Connection to the Mercator projection===

Let be the longitude of a point on the sphere, and its latitude. Then, if we define the map coordinates of the Mercator projection as
:formula_15
a loxodrome with constant bearing from true north will be a straight line, since (using the expression in the previous section)
:formula_16
with a slope
:formula_17

Finding the loxodromes between two given points can be done graphically on a Mercator map, or by solving a nonlinear system of two equations in the two unknowns and . There are infinitely many solutions; the shortest one is that which covers the actual longitude difference, i.e. does not make extra revolutions, and does not go &quot;the wrong way around&quot;.

The distance between two points , measured along a loxodrome, is simply the absolute value of the secant of the bearing (azimuth) times the north–south distance (except for circles of latitude for which the distance becomes infinite):

:formula_18

where is one of the earth average radii.

==Application==
Its use in navigation is directly linked to the style, or &quot;projection&quot; of certain navigational maps. A rhumb line appears as a straight line on a Mercator projection map.

The name is derived from Old French or Spanish respectively: &quot;rumb&quot; or &quot;rumbo&quot;, a line on the chart which intersects all meridians at the same angle. On a plane surface this would be the shortest distance between two points. Over the Earth&#x27;s surface at low latitudes or over short distances it can be used for plotting the course of a vehicle, aircraft or ship. Over longer distances and/or at higher latitudes the great circle route is significantly shorter than the rhumb line between the same two points. However the inconvenience of having to continuously change bearings while travelling a great circle route makes &quot;rhumb line navigation&quot; appealing in certain instances.

The point can be illustrated with an east–west passage over 90 degrees of longitude along the equator, for which the great circle and rhumb line distances are the same, at . At 20 degrees north the great circle distance is while the rhumb line distance is , about 1.5% further. But at 60 degrees north the great circle distance is while the rhumb line is , a difference of 8.5%. A more extreme case is the air route between New York City and Hong Kong, for which the rhumb line path is . The great circle route over the North Pole is , or hours less flying time at a typical cruising speed.

Some old maps in the Mercator projection have grids composed of lines of latitude and longitude but also show rhumb lines which are oriented directly towards north, at a right angle from the north, or at some angle from the north which is some simple rational fraction of a right angle. These rhumb lines would be drawn so that they would converge at certain points of the map: lines going in every direction would converge at each of these points. See compass rose. Such maps would necessarily have been in the Mercator projection therefore not all old maps would have been capable of showing rhumb line markings.

The radial lines on a compass rose are also called &quot;rhumbs&quot;. The expression &quot;sailing on a rhumb&quot; was used in the 16th–19th centuries to indicate a particular compass heading.

Early navigators in the time before the invention of the marine chronometer used rhumb line courses on long ocean passages, because the ship&#x27;s latitude could be established accurately by sightings of the Sun or stars but there was no accurate way to determine the longitude. The ship would sail north or south until the latitude of the destination was reached, and the ship would then sail east or west along the rhumb line (actually a parallel, which is a special case of the rhumb line), maintaining a constant latitude and recording regular estimates of the distance sailed until evidence of land was sighted.

==Generalizations==

===On the Riemann sphere===

The surface of the Earth can be understood mathematically as a Riemann sphere, that is, as a projection of the sphere to the complex plane. In this case, loxodromes can be understood as certain classes of Möbius transformations.

===Spheroid===
The formulation above can be easily extended to a spheroid. The course of the rhumb line is found merely by using the ellipsoidal isometric latitude. In formulas above on this page, substitute the conformal latitude on the ellipsoid for the latitude on the sphere. Similarly, distances are found by multiplying the ellipsoidal meridian arc length by the secant of the azimuth.

<text>Nicholas Ridley ( – 16 October 1555) was an English Bishop of London (the only bishop called &quot;Bishop of London and Westminster&quot;). Ridley was one of the Oxford Martyrs burned at the stake during the Marian Persecutions, for his teachings and his support of Lady Jane Grey. He is remembered with a commemoration in the calendar of saints (with Hugh Latimer) in some parts of the Anglican Communion (Church of England) on 16 October.

==Early years and advancement (c.1500–50)==
Ridley came from a prominent family in Tynedale, Northumberland. He was the second son of Christopher Ridley, first cousin of Lancelot Ridley and grew up in Unthank Hall from the old House of Unthank located on the site of an ancient watch tower or pele tower. As a boy, Ridley was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he proceeded to Master of Arts in 1525. Soon afterward he was ordained as a priest and went to the Sorbonne, in Paris, for further education. After returning to England around 1529, he became the senior proctor of Cambridge University in 1534. Around that time there was significant debate about the Pope&#x27;s supremacy. Ridley was well versed on Biblical hermeneutics, and through his arguments the university came up with the following resolution: &quot;That the Bishop of Rome had no more authority and jurisdiction derived to him from God, in this kingdom of England, than any other foreign bishop.&quot; He graduated B.D. in 1537 and was then appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, to serve as one of his chaplains. In April 1538, Cranmer made him vicar of Herne, in Kent.

In 1540–1, he was made one of the King&#x27;s Chaplains, and was also presented with a prebendal stall in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1540 he was made Master of Pembroke College and in 1541 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity. In 1543 he was accused of heresy, but he was able to beat the charge. Cranmer had resolved to support the English Reformation by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking. Ridley was made the Bishop of Rochester in 1547, and shortly after coming to office, directed that the altars in the churches of his diocese should be removed, and tables put in their place to celebrate the Lord&#x27;s Supper. In 1548, he helped Cranmer compile the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and in 1549 he was one of the commissioners who investigated Bishops Stephen Gardiner and Edmund Bonner. He concurred that they should be removed. John Ponet took Ridley&#x27;s former position. Incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers.

When Ridley was appointed to the see of London by letters patent on 1 April 1550, he was called the &quot;Bishop of London and Westminster&quot; because the Diocese of London had just re-absorbed the dissolved Diocese of Westminster.

==Vestments controversy (1550–3)==
Ridley played a major part in the vestments controversy. John Hooper, having been exiled during King Henry&#x27;s reign, returned to England in 1548 from the churches in Zurich that had been reformed by Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger in a highly iconoclastic fashion. When Hooper was invited to give a series of Lenten sermons before the king in February 1550, he spoke against Cranmer&#x27;s 1549 ordinal whose oath mentioned &quot;all saints&quot; and required newly elected bishops and those attending the ordination ceremony to wear a cope and surplice. In Hooper&#x27;s view, these requirements were vestiges of Judaism and Roman Catholicism, which had no biblical warrant for Christians since they were not used in the early Christian church.
Summoned to answer to the Privy Council and archbishop—who were primarily concerned with Hooper&#x27;s willingness to accept the royal supremacy, which was also part of the oath for newly ordained clergy—Hooper evidently made sufficient reassurances, as he was soon appointed to the bishopric of Gloucester. Hooper declined the office, however, because of the required vestments and oath by the saints. The king accepted Hooper&#x27;s position, but the Privy Council did not. Called before them on 15 May 1550, a compromise was reached. Vestments were to be considered a matter of adiaphora, or &quot;Res Indifferentes&quot; (&quot;things indifferent&quot;, as opposed to an article of faith), and Hooper could be ordained without them at his discretion, but he must allow that others could wear them. Hooper passed confirmation of the new office again before the king and council on 20 July 1550 when the issue was raised again, and Cranmer was instructed that Hooper was not to be charged &quot;with an oath burdensome to his conscience&quot;.

Cranmer assigned Ridley to perform the consecration, and Ridley refused to do anything but follow the form of the ordinal as it had been prescribed by Parliament. Ridley, it seems likely, had some particular objection to Hooper. It has been suggested that Henrician exiles like Hooper, who had experienced some of the more radically reformed churches on the continent, were at odds with English clergy who had accepted and never left the established church. John Henry Primus also notes that on 24 July 1550, the day after receiving instructions for Hooper&#x27;s unique consecration, the church of the Austin Friars in London had been granted to Jan Laski for use as a Stranger church. This was to be a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees, a church with forms and practices that had taken reforms much further than Ridley would have liked. This development—the use of a London church virtually outside Ridley&#x27;s jurisdiction—was one that Hooper had had a hand in.

The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley responded in person, agreeing that vestments are indifferent but making a compelling argument that the monarch may require indifferent things without exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged on for months without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, and he pointed to St Paul&#x27;s concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley&#x27;s position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper&#x27;s primary concern.

===Hooper–Ridley debate===

In a Latin letter dated 3 October 1550, Hooper laid out his argument &quot;contra usum vestium&quot;. With Ridley&#x27;s reply (in English), it marks the first written representation of a split in the English Reformation. Hooper&#x27;s argument is that vestments should not be used as they are not indifferent, nor is their use supported by scripture, a point he takes as self-evident. He contends that church practices must either have express biblical support or be things indifferent, approval for which is implied by scripture. Furthermore, an indifferent thing, if used, causes no profit or loss. Ridley objected in his response, saying that indifferent things do have profitable effects, which is the only reason they are used. Failing to distinguish between conditions for indifferent things in general and the church&#x27;s use of indifferent things, Hooper then all but excludes the possibility of anything being indifferent in the four conditions he sets:

:1) An indifferent thing has either an express justification in scripture or is implied by it, finding its origin and foundation in scripture.

Hooper cites Romans 14:23 (whatever is not faith is sin), Romans 10:17 (faith comes from hearing the word of God), and Matthew 15:13 (everything not &quot;planted&quot; by God will be &quot;rooted up&quot;) to argue that indifferent things must be done in faith, and since what cannot be proved from scripture is not of faith, indifferent things must be proved from scripture, which is both necessary and sufficient authority, as opposed to tradition. Hooper maintains that priestly garb distinguishing clergy from laity is not indicated by scripture; there is no mention of it in the New Testament as being in use in the early church, and the use of priestly clothing in the Old Testament is a Hebrew practice, a type or foreshadowing that finds its antitype in Christ, who abolishes the old order and recognises the spiritual equality, or priesthood, of all Christians. The historicity of these claims is further supported by Hooper with a reference to Polydore Vergil&#x27;s &quot;De Inventoribus Rerum&quot;.

In response, Ridley rejected Hooper&#x27;s insistence on biblical origins and countered Hooper&#x27;s interpretations of his chosen biblical texts. He points out that many non-controversial practices are not mentioned or implied in scripture. Ridley denies that early church practices are normative for the present situation, and he links such primitivist arguments with the Anabaptists. Joking that Hooper&#x27;s reference to Christ&#x27;s nakedness on the cross is as insignificant as the clothing King Herod put Christ in and &quot;a jolly argument&quot; for the Adamites, Ridley does not dispute Hooper&#x27;s main typological argument, but neither does he accept that vestments are necessarily or exclusively identified with Israel and the Roman church. On Hooper&#x27;s point about the priesthood of all believers, Ridley says it does not follow from this doctrine that all Christians must wear the same clothes.

:2) An indifferent thing must be left to individual discretion; if required, it is no longer indifferent.

For Ridley, on matters of indifference, one must defer conscience to the authorities of the church, or else &quot;thou showest thyself a disordered person, disobedient, as [a] contemner of lawful authority, and a wounder of thy weak brother his conscience.&quot; For him, the debate was finally about legitimate authority, not the merits and demerits of vestments themselves. He contended that it is only accidental that the compulsory ceases to be indifferent; the degeneration of a practice into non-indifference can be corrected without throwing out the practice. Things are not, &quot;because they have been abused, to be taken away, but to be reformed and amended, and so kept still.&quot;

:3) An indifferent thing&#x27;s usefulness must be demonstrated and not introduced arbitrarily.

For this point, Hooper cites 1 Corinthians 14 and 2 Corinthians 13. As it contradicts the first point above, Primus contends that Hooper must now refer to indifferent things in the church and earlier meant indifferent things in general, in the abstract. Regardless, the apparent contradiction was seized by Ridley and undoubtedly hurt Hooper&#x27;s case with the council.

:4) Indifferent things must be introduced into the church with apostolic and evangelical lenity, not violent tyranny.
In making such an inflammatory, risky statement (he later may have called his opponents &quot;papists&quot; in a part of his argument that is lost), Hooper may not have been suggesting England was tyrannical but that Rome was—and that England could become like Rome. Ridley warned Hooper of the implications of an attack on English ecclesiastical and civil authority and of the consequences of radical individual liberties, while also reminding him that it was Parliament that established the &quot;Book of Common Prayer in the church of England&quot;.

In closing, Hooper asks that the dispute be resolved by church authorities without looking to civil authorities for support—although the monarch was the head of both the church and the state. This hint of a plea for a separation of church and state would later be elaborated by Thomas Cartwright, but for Hooper, although the word of God was the highest authority, the state could still impose upon men&#x27;s consciences (such as requiring them not to be Roman Catholic) when it had a biblical warrant. Moreover, Hooper himself addressed the civil magistrates, suggesting that the clergy supporting vestments were a threat to the state, and he declared his willingness to be martyred for his cause. Ridley, by contrast, responds with humour, calling this &quot;a magnifical promise set forth with a stout style&quot;. He invites Hooper to agree that vestments are indifferent, not to condemn them as sinful, and then he will ordain him even if he wears street clothes to the ceremony.

===Outcome of the controversy===
The weaknesses in Hooper&#x27;s argument, Ridley&#x27;s laconic and temperate rejoinder, and Ridley&#x27;s offer of a compromise no doubt turned the council against Hooper&#x27;s inflexible convictions when he did not accept it. Heinrich Bullinger, Pietro Martire Vermigli, and Martin Bucer, while agreeing with Hooper&#x27;s views, ceased to support him for the pragmatic sake of unity and slower reform. Only Jan Laski remained a constant ally. Some time in mid-December 1550, Hooper was put under house arrest, during which time he wrote and published &quot;A godly Confession and protestation of the Christian faith&quot;. Because of this publication, his persistent nonconformism, and violations of the terms of his house arrest, Hooper was placed in Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s custody at Lambeth Palace for two weeks by the Privy Council on 13 January 1551. Hooper was then sent to Fleet Prison by the council, who made that decision on 27 January. On 15 February, Hooper submitted to consecration in vestments in a letter to Cranmer. He was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester on 8 March 1551, and shortly thereafter, preached before the king in vestments.

==Downfall (1553–5)==

On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint John Knox, a Scot, as vicar of All Hallows, Bread Street in London, placing him under the authority of Ridley. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the king and the court during Lent, after which he refused to take his assigned post. That same year, Ridley petitioned Edward VI to give some of his empty palaces over to the City of London (governed by the City of London Corporation) to house homeless women and children. The subsequent royal charter of 1553 (26 June, 7 Edw. VI) created three institutions Christ&#x27;s Hospital, St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and the Bridewell Hospital. The latter subsequently changing its name to King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley.

Edward VI became seriously ill from tuberculosis and in mid-June the councillors were told that he did not have long to live. They set to work to convince several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward&#x27;s cousin, instead of Mary, daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon and a Roman Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act.

Ridley signed the letters patent giving the English throne to Lady Jane Grey. On 9 July 1553 he preached a sermon at St Paul&#x27;s cross in which he affirmed that the princesses Mary and Elizabeth were bastards. By mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary&#x27;s favour and support for Jane in the council fell. As Mary was proclaimed queen, Ridley, Jane&#x27;s father, the Duke of Suffolk and others were imprisoned. Ridley was sent to the Tower of London.

Through February 1554 Jane and her leading supporters were executed. After that, there was time to deal with the religious leaders of the English Reformation and so on 8 March 1554 the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Hugh Latimer to be transferred to Bocardo prison in Oxford to await trial for heresy. The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer&#x27;s with John Jewel acting as notary to Ridley. Their verdicts came almost immediately: they were to be burned at the stake.

==Death and legacy==

The sentence was carried out on 16 October 1555 in Oxford. Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings. Ridley burned extremely slowly and suffered a great deal: his brother-in-law had put more tinder on the pyre in order to speed his death, but this only caused his lower parts to burn. Latimer is supposed to have said to Ridley, &quot;Be of good comfort, and play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God&#x27;s grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.&quot; This was quoted in &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;.

A metal cross in a cobbled patch of road in Broad Street, Oxford, marks the site. Eventually Ridley and Latimer were seen as martyrs for their support of a Church of England independent from the Roman Catholic Church. Along with Thomas Cranmer, they are known as the Oxford Martyrs.

In the Victorian era, his death was commemorated by the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial, located not far from the site of his execution. As well as being a monument to the English Reformation and the doctrines of the Protestant and Reformed doctrines, the memorial is a landmark of the 19th century, a monument stoutly resisted by John Keble, John Henry Newman and others of the Tractarian Movement and Oxford Movement. Profoundly alarmed at the Romewardizing intrusions and efforts at realignment that the movement was attempting to bring into the Church of England, Protestant and Reformed Anglican clergymen raised the funds for erecting the monument, with its highly anti-Roman Catholic inscription, a memorial to over three hundred years of history and reformation. As a result, the monument was built 300 years after the events it commemorates.
In 1881, Ridley Hall in Cambridge, England, was founded in his memory for the training of Anglican priests. Ridley College, a private university-preparatory school located in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, was founded in his honour in 1889. Also named after him is Ridley College (Melbourne), an evangelical Anglican theological college in Australia, founded in 1910. There is a Church of England church dedicated to him in Welling, southeast London. The words spoken to Ridley by Latimer at their execution are used. Ridley and Latimer are remembered with a commemoration in the calendar of saints in some parts of the Anglican Communion on 16 October.

<doc id="250278" wikidata="Q271732" url="?curid=250278" title="Heidi Fleiss">
<text>Heidi Lynne Fleiss (born December 30, 1965) is an American former madam. She ran an upscale prostitution ring based in Los Angeles and is often referred to as the &quot;Hollywood Madam&quot;. Fleiss has also worked as a columnist and was a television personality regularly featured in the 1990s in American media.

==Early life==
Fleiss was born and raised in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her father, Paul M. Fleiss (1933–2014), was a pediatrician and her mother, Elissa (née Ash), was an elementary school teacher. Their marriage ended in divorce. She has two brothers: Jesse (born in 1977), and Jason (born in 1968), who drowned at age 41 in 2009; and three sisters: Amy, Kim, and Shana.

==Prostitution and tax evasion==
At the age of 22, Fleiss began managing a prostitution ring under Madam Alex after meeting her in 1987 via Fleiss&#x27;s film-director boyfriend Iván Nagy. Fleiss stated in 2002 that Alex and she had &quot;a very intense relationship&quot; and that Alex&#x27;s view of Fleiss &quot;was kind of like the daughter she loved and hated, so she was abusive and loving at the same time&quot;. In the same interview, Fleiss said she worked as a prostitute for a short period to learn all aspects of the trade. At the time she was learning to take over Alex&#x27;s business there was a labor shortage, as most of Alex&#x27;s prostitutes were approaching middle age and planning to retire from prostitution. Alex had Fleiss revitalize the business by recruiting a new batch of young, attractive women.

By 1990, Fleiss severed her links with Madam Alex and began her own prostitution ring. Fleiss has stated that she made her first million dollars after only four months in the business as a madam and that on her slowest night, she made $10,000. By 1991, Fleiss was so successful that she was able to reject women who wished to work for her. In June 1993, she was arrested on charges including attempted pandering.

Federal charges were filed in 1994, and Fleiss posted $1 million bail; the state trial began the same year and Fleiss was convicted. In May 1996, her state conviction was overturned and her appeal bond was set at $200,000. She was convicted of federal charges of tax evasion in September 1996 and sentenced to seven years in prison. Fleiss served 20 months at the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, California. She was released to a halfway house on November 19, 1998 and ordered to perform 370 hours of community service.

Fleiss&#x27;s ring reportedly had numerous prominent and wealthy clients. When questioned by British television presenter Davina McCall about revealing the names of her clients, she replied &quot;It&#x27;s not my style&quot;.

==Media appearances==
In 1995, Nick Broomfield made a documentary about her prostitution ring titled &quot;Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam&quot;. In 2004, a TV movie was produced titled &quot;Call Me: The Rise and Fall of Heidi Fleiss&quot;.

In 1996, after having been convicted of being a madam, and shortly before her incarceration for such offences, she was interviewed by Ruby Wax.

Fleiss and reality-TV personality Victoria Sellers hosted and produced an instructional DVD titled &quot;Sex Tips with Heidi Fleiss and Victoria Sellers&quot; in 2001.

In January 2010, Fleiss was the third housemate to enter the final Channel 4 series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in the UK; she was the second to be evicted. She did not return for the finale.

==Business interests==
In 2005, Fleiss announced plans to open a brothel in Pahrump, Nevada named Heidi Fleiss&#x27;s Stud Farm&quot; In 2007, Fleiss opened a laundromat named Dirty Laundry in Pahrump as her plans for the brothel had been put on hold due to a &quot;slight complication&quot;. In 2009, she said that she had abandoned her plans to open such a brothel because she did not want to &quot;deal with all the nonsense in the sex business&quot;. Instead, she said she would focus on renewable energy, which she described as &quot;perfect for Nevada&quot; and &quot;the wave of the future&quot;. She opened a fashion boutique in Los Angeles after being released from prison.

, and since at least January 2017, Fleiss owns and manages the Flying S Ranch Ultralight Flightpark, an ultralight private use airport in Pahrump, with FAA designation NV54.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Fleiss accused actor Tom Sizemore, her ex-boyfriend, of domestic violence. Sizemore was convicted of the charge.

Fleiss eventually moved to Pahrump, Nevada, a small town near Death Valley while caring for 25 parrots. Drew Pinsky, who treated Fleiss for substance abuse, performed brain scans on her that showed significant frontal lobe dysfunction, which Pinsky surmised was behind her inability to empathize with people, and her propensity for doing so with birds.

In 2009, Fleiss was treated for substance abuse at the Pasadena Recovery Center, which was filmed for the third season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. One of her fellow patients was Sizemore, against whom her prior restraining order had lapsed. Both Fleiss and Sizemore consented to appear together on the show before filming began, and their reunion, depicted in the third episode, was amicable, though Fleiss subsequently expressed mixed feelings about his presence there. During the filming of the program, Fleiss left the center, and she was involved in an accident with her SUV near her home in Nevada. She subsequently returned to rehab.

After completing treatment for substance abuse, Fleiss briefly became engaged to Dennis Hof, owner of Nevada&#x27;s Moonlite BunnyRanch. Fleiss said in 1994 that she is a vegetarian.

In August 2013, Nevada police found nearly 400 marijuana plants growing at her home in Pahrump, Nevada, but did not arrest Fleiss and submitted their report to the district attorney&#x27;s office.

In 2022, Fleiss announced that she would be moving to Missouri after someone shot one of her parrots with a pellet gun.

==In media==
In 2022, Fleiss was the subject of &quot;HeidiWorld: The Heidi Fleiss Story&quot;, an iHeartRadio podcast produced, written and hosted by Molly Lambert.

Having struggled to compete with more modern family attractions, Flevohof went bankrupt in 1993, and was subsequently purchased by the Walibi Group that autumn, who redeveloped the site as an amusement park. After a major winter-long programme of reconstruction the park reopened as &quot;Walibi Flevo&quot; on 7 May 1994, featuring the world&#x27;s first Vekoma suspended looping coaster (SLC), El Condor. The park also adopted the wallaby mascot of its sister park, &quot;Walibi Wavre&quot; in Belgium created in 1975 by Eddy Meeùs, a Belgian businessman. (The name &#x27;Walibi&#x27;, incidentally, is derived from the first two letters of three towns in Belgium put together to form a single word: Wavre - Limal - Bierges).

The Walibi parks, including Bellewaerde in Belgium, were purchased by Premier Parks Inc. in 1998, who subsequently overhauled the &quot;Flevo&quot; park, removing the &#x27;Walibi&#x27; branding and building thirty new attractions as part of its transformation into &quot;Six Flags Holland&quot; in 2000. Six Flags&#x27;s nominal expansion into Europe saw a similar refurbishment of the Belgian Walibi theme park, which was renamed to Six Flags Belgium. Both parks benefiting from the group&#x27;s rights to use Warner Brothers characters within them, leading to the creation of a Looney Tunes-themed area and a powered-launch coaster themed around popular comic figure Superman, later changed to the Xpress.

In 2004, &quot;Six Flags Holland&quot; and its sister parks were purchased by financiers Palamon Capital Partners, who grouped the attractions under the name &quot;StarParks&quot;. The park reverted to &quot;Walibi&quot; branding in 2005; numerous attractions having been rebranded as the sale of the parks also meant the loss of any references to Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters rights.

In the second half of 2006, the parks were sold for the second time in as many years to the French group Grévin &amp; Cie (Compagnie des Alpes), most notably the operators of the French themed resort Parc Astérix, who also purchased two other Dutch attractions - the Dolfinarium Harderwijk and . In 2011, the park was renamed as Walibi Holland, which introduced new mascots.

The adjacent associated event grounds were originally developed with Scouting Nederland for the EuroJam 1994 and the 18th World Scout Jamboree in 1995. It is or has been the location of many festivals such as the Lowlands music festival and the Defqon.1 music festival.

<text>Six Flags Great Adventure is an amusement park located approximately southeast of Trenton in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Owned and operated by Six Flags, the park complex is situated between New York City and Philadelphia and includes a water park named Hurricane Harbor. It first opened to the public as simply Great Adventure in 1974 under the direction of restaurateur Warner LeRoy. Six Flags acquired the park in 1977. The park is located right off of Interstate 195 and is along Monmouth Road (County Route 537).

In 2012, Six Flags combined its Great Adventure with its Wild Safari animal park to form Six Flags Great Adventure &amp; Safari. At , it is the second-largest theme park in the world following Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom.

==History==
===Warner LeRoy era (1974–1977)===
In 1972, entrepreneurial businessman Warner LeRoy developed concept plans for the Great Adventure entertainment complex, proposing seven parks be built within the complex: An amusement park, a safari park, a show park, a floral park, a sports complex, a shopping district, and a campground with beach/waterpark and stables. His proposal also included plans for hotels, which were connected to the parks and could be reached by boats, buses, a sky ride and/or a monorail. LeRoy wanted his parks to flow naturally through the forest and lakes, capitalizing on the back-to-nature movement of the era. He chose a property then owned by the Switlik family, in an area centrally located between the New York City and Philadelphia regions. The property on County Route 537 had easy access to the newly constructed Interstate 195, which connected central New Jersey to the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and would eventually (in 1981) connect to the Garden State Parkway.

Since the park&#x27;s opening, it has been served by in-house emergency services composing of the Fire Department (Ocean County Station 58) and Emergency Medical Service (Ocean County Squad 80).

LeRoy collaborated with Hardwicke Industries, who previously built safari parks in Canada and Europe. Together, they set out to open the seven parks in stages over a 5-year period. After a 4,500 invitation-only guest opening on June 30, 1974, the Great Adventure entertainment complex opened to the general public on July 1, 1974, at a price tag of $10 million. At the time of the opening, only the Enchanted Forest area and Safari park were operational, with elements from five of the other planned parks being used to create the Enchanted Forest.

The Enchanted Forest was designed and built to look bigger-than-life. A &quot;Big Balloon&quot; was a tethered hot-air balloon that loomed over the park&#x27;s entrance and was the biggest of its kind in the world. The &quot;Log Flume&quot; was the longest log ride constructed in the world at that time and it was accompanied by a giant &quot;Conestoga Wagon&quot;, an over-sized log cabin restaurant called &quot;Best of the West&quot; and a huge Western Fortress, in the park&#x27;s Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Rip Roarin&#x27; section. The &quot;Giant Wheel&quot; (now Big Wheel), then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, and the &quot;Freedom Fountain&quot;, then the largest spraying fountain in the world, were located on the opposite end of the park. One of the few smaller-than-real life attractions was an outdoor walk-through attraction called the &quot;Garden of Marvels&quot;. It used working G-scale (o-g scale) LGB trains and boats among models of American landmarks and 1/25-scale recreations of European castles.
This miniature village was an idea taken from LeRoy&#x27;s proposed &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; floral park. A tree filled with snakes, a carousel, antique cars, koi pond, children&#x27;s playground (called Kiddie Kingdom), petting zoo (named Happy Feeling) and a restaurant named Gingerbread Fancy (now Granny&#x27;s Country Kitchen) were also borrowed from the floral park concept to create a section of The Enchanted Forest. This section created the park&#x27;s main midway named &quot;Dream Street&quot;.

&quot;Shoppe Lane&quot; was named after a proposed &quot;shopping extravaganza&quot; park, which LeRoy had designed for the property. It lent its large open squares, huge fountain (Main Street Fountain), street performers (clowns and stilt walkers) and shops to the Enchanted Forest. Fairy Tales was the name of a shop that opened with the park in one of the park&#x27;s over-sized bazaar tents. It sold stuffed animals and toys, including Superman. Other influences from LeRoy&#x27;s proposal would surface in the years to come.

&quot;Neptune&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; was a concept for a lakeside, aquatic show park. From its design came &quot;Aqua Spectacle&quot;, the home for dolphin performances and high dive shows. Today, the stadium later known as Fort Independence is demolished. Neptune&#x27;s Kingdom was designed to run the length from Runaway Train to Northern Star Arena, but most of its influences appear in the park&#x27;s Lakefront area.

Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; opened with Runaway Mine Train on the grand opening on Independence Day. A small compact coaster named &quot;Big Fury&quot; opened later in the season. The &quot;Skyride&quot; connected two ends of the park with stations in &quot;Rootin&#x27; Tootin″&quot; and &quot;Dream Street&quot;. The double skyway ran originally at the 1964–65 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The Great Train Ride was a small train ride that brought guests through a loop of the woods, rather than to a destination of another gate. A small handful of spin rides were located in the &quot;Strawberry Fair&quot; section and were as close to any thematic journey as the guests were going to take. The &quot;Fantasy Fling&quot; is older than the park and is the only survivor of these spin rides in 2008.

The &quot;Fun Fair&quot; area debuted in 1975 with several new spinning rides, a smaller Ferris wheel, and a Schwarzkopf Jumbo Jet roller coaster. The coaster never opened and was removed at the end of the season. A second flume called the &quot;Moon Flume&quot; was built by Arrow Dynamics to ease crowds on the Log Flume. It was built on the opposite end of the park and the station turntable is used for the stage of the Wiggles show today. The &quot;Fortune Festival&quot; was a new game section that was located where the Boardwalk section exists today.

LeRoy&#x27;s original vision for the amusement park featured many dark rides. Although &quot;Man, Time and Space&quot;, &quot;The Keystone Cops&quot; and &quot;(Alice) Down the Wishing Well&quot; (among others) never came to be, the &quot;Haunted Castle Across the Moat&quot;, which was added a few years later, took its cue from the rooms and monsters of the &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;.

In the early 1980s, the park&#x27;s entrance was moved to a new central location, which is still in use today. It was designed with an outer mall called &quot;Liberty Court&quot;, and its Federal style architecture was influenced by the celebration of the United States Bicentennial. An inner mall called &quot;Avenue of States&quot; was adorned by fifty state flags in the central corridor. Six flags remain on Main Street today. The Enchanted Forest name on the park was changed to the complex&#x27;s main name of Great Adventure. The Strawberry Fair and Fun Fair names were discontinued and the attractions in these areas became part of the newly named Enchanted Forest section. More spin rides, &quot;yummy yummy&quot; food, shows, games and the Safari became a part of &quot;the greatest day of your life.&quot; The park became a major attraction with dozens of rides, shows, and several steel roller coasters. The &quot;Big Balloon&quot;, &quot;Happy Kid Ride&quot;, &quot;The Gondola&quot;, &quot;Pretty Monster&quot;, and &quot;Super Cat&quot; were the first attractions to be removed from the park before a new owner would make big changes.

===Penn Central / Bally&#x27;s / Westray Capital era (1977–1992)===
In 1977, construction began on a steel looping shuttle coaster called Lightnin&#x27; Loops (which was removed in 1992). Late that year, however, the park was purchased by Six Flags. This regional theme park company was owned then by Penn Central, which had large stakes in the Philadelphia and New York City regions. Six Flags added rides found in bigger theme parks such as the wooden coaster called Rolling Thunder in 1979, The Buccaneer (a swinging ship from Intamin), Roaring Rapids (now Congo Rapids, an Intamin River Rapids ride), Parachuter&#x27;s Perch (now Parachute Training Center: Edwards AFB Jump Tower, an Intamin Parachute ride) and Freefall (later Stuntman&#x27;s Freefall, an Intamin First Generation Freefall), all before the park&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

1980 saw very few changes. In 1981, the park added a water ride called Roaring Rapids (now called Congo River Rapids). In 1983, the park added a Freefall Ride and in 1984, the park added a roller coaster called the Sarajevo Bobsleds but closed and removed Lil&#x27; Thunder, a kiddie coaster, keeping the coaster count to four.

Eight teenagers, including four students and one graduate of Franklin K. Lane High School, lost their lives in a fire at the Haunted Castle on May 11, 1984, sparking controversy over the safety of such attractions. After the incident, new fire safety laws were passed for amusement park fun houses and dark rides.

1986 saw the addition of a second looping coaster and the park&#x27;s fifth roller coaster, Ultra Twister, with spiral inline twists. The ride was built next to Rolling Thunder, partially taking away the area&#x27;s western theme. Another water ride called Splashwater Falls (which became Movietown Water Effect in 1992 and has since been removed) was added in which riders rode in a large boat which was pulled uphill and then down a steep waterfall, soaking riders. The new addition was made since attendance at the park had lowered since the Haunted Castle fire, and the park realized new additions were needed to keep the park alive.

Attendance dropped even further when an accident occurred on the Lightnin&#x27; Loops roller coaster in 1987. A teenage girl was thrown from the train because she was seated on the wrong side of the shoulder restraint. After the accident, new safety features were added not only to Great Adventure&#x27;s roller coasters but also to roller coasters around the world. Once again, Great Adventure set both a bad and later good example for the amusement park world. However, the accident was not good for the park&#x27;s attendance. Attendance was so low, in fact, that in 1987 rumors began to spread that the park may close in a few years. At the end of that season, the park was slated to get a new multiple looping coaster but by the end of the year, it was decided that Six Flags Great America would get the coaster since Great Adventure was not seen as a good investment. At the end of 1988, the park was about to lose its license to sell food, and attendance was so low park management realized a big new addition was necessary.

In the spring of 1988, it was announced that the park would indeed get a new coaster. Sarajevo Bobsleds was removed to make room for the new coaster, The Great American Scream Machine, which opened in April 1989. This coaster had multiple loops and for a month was the tallest roller coaster in the world and brought the park back to five roller coasters. The Scream Machine was removed in 2010 to make room for the new Green Lantern stand-up coaster.

In 1990, as part of a ride rotation program, a stand up looping roller coaster called Shockwave was added to the park. Shockwave had previously operated at Six Flags Magic Mountain. However, Ultra Twister was removed at the end of 1989 and sent to Six Flags Astroworld for the 1991 season keeping the park&#x27;s coaster count at five. In 1991, the park added a huge complex of &quot;dry&quot; waterslides. While guests got wet on them, they could ride these with regular clothes or swimsuits. These slides were themed after the rivers of the world. Roaring Rapids, as well as the second flume ride in the park, were incorporated into this complex. Roaring Rapids became Congo Rapids, and The Hydro Flume became Irrawaddy Riptide.

===Time Warner era (1990–1997)===
In 1990, Time Warner acquired a 19.5% stake in Six Flags, then by the end of 1991 acquired an additional 30.5% giving them 50% ownership of the corporation, with the remaining divided equally by silent partners, The Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder. Time Warner used the opportunity to advertise and promote their movies through the Six Flags parks. Time Warner purchased the remaining 50% in 1993, then in 1995 sold 51% of the corporation to Boston Ventures. Time Warner, however continued to manage the parks through 1997.

In 1992, the eastern area or Fun Fair area of the park was re-themed Action Town, and then Movietown in 1993. A Batman stunt show was added and the announcement that a new inverted looping roller coaster called Batman The Ride would be added. Lightnin&#x27; Loops opened for the first half of the season but was disassembled at the end of July to begin construction of Batman. That coaster was sold to Premier Parks, which at the time was a different company than Six Flags (but would eventually buy Six Flags). Premier Parks put one of the Lightnin&#x27; Loops tracks in Frontier City located in Oklahoma City and it still operates today. Premier Parks put the other Lightnin&#x27; Loops track in their park in Largo, Maryland (near Washington, DC), then called Adventure World. That track was renamed the Python, which would be removed in 1999. At the end of 1992, the roller coaster Shockwave was removed as part of the &quot;Ride Rotation Program&quot; of Six Flags. Shockwave would be sent to Six Flags Astroworld and would reopen there in 1993 as Batman The Escape. So by the end of 1992, the park was down to just three coasters.

Batman, designed by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, opened in the spring of 1993 bringing the coaster count back up to four. In 1994, a motion simulator theatre ride was added. Initially, it was an airplane flying themed attraction but has since been changed to a Halloween theme in the fall over the years. A dinosaur theme and a three-dimensional dinosaur theme was also used for this attraction. For several years, it operated as SpongeBob the ride and then as &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot;. For the 2010 season, the attraction did not run and that building remained vacant for future use.

1995 saw the addition of Viper, a steel spiral looping roller coaster similar to Ultra Twister and in Ultra Twister&#x27;s old spot, bringing the coaster count to five again. 1996 saw the addition of an indoor themed junior roller coaster called Skull Mountain. In 1997, a multiple looping dual track shuttle coaster called Batman &amp; Robin: The Chiller was built but only opened for a day and encountered more technical difficulties. This coaster ended up not opening again until the spring of 1998. This coaster ran rather rough and was referred to as a &quot;headbanger&quot; as was Viper and to a lesser extent The Scream Machine. The Mine Train and Rolling Thunder were also rough rides by then. Also, many flat rides were removed over the years and the park was showing signs of wear and tear, as well as obsolete attractions.

===Premier era (1998–2005)===
Premier Parks purchased Six Flags from Time Warner and Boston Ventures on April 1, 1998. The following year, the new management team added a dozen flat rides to the park and declared a &quot;war on lines&quot;. The Adventure River complex was retired but the flume ride and the Congo Rapids remained. A kiddie water play area also remained as part of a new kiddie ride area called Looney Tunes Seaport. A junior roller coaster called Blackbeard&#x27;s Lost Treasure Train (now known as Harley Quinn Crazy Train) as well as a kiddie roller coaster called Road Runner Railway were also added, but the star attraction was a floorless steel multiple looping roller coaster called Medusa.

No changes were made at the park in 2000, but across the property on a separate parking lot, a Waterpark named Hurricane Harbor was built and opened at the end of May. This was also separately gated and charges a separate admission from Great Adventure. The park consists of a dozen waterslides, a kiddie water play area, and a wavepool.

In 2001, the park added another state of the art roller coaster called Nitro. In 2002, Batman &amp; Robin: The Chiller was renovated and new trains without over the shoulder harnesses were added making it a much smoother ride. In 2003, was added. Exact models of this are found at Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Great America. In 2004, new harnesses were added to the Runaway Mine Train and the up-charge attraction erUPtion was added to the Boardwalk.

In 2005, the park added the world&#x27;s tallest coaster called Kingda Ka and also dismantled Viper. With the addition of Kingda Ka, the season pass holders entrance to the park was closed because Kingda Ka&#x27;s footprint went right over it. A new children&#x27;s play area called Balin&#x27;s Jungleland was also added. In 2006, a wooden twister coaster called El Toro was added in the spot formerly occupied by Viper, along with a new themed area, and another kiddie ride area to replace Bugs Bunny Land which was retired at the end of 2004.

===Shapiro era (2006–2010)===
At the end of 2005, a proxy battle resulted in two major stockholders assuming control of the Six Flags Board. The Premier Group was ousted in December and the new board appointed Mark Shapiro as CEO. In 2007, the park added Wiggles World and removed Batman &amp; Robin: The Chiller. The rolls were replaced with banked hills to enhance ride performance. However, the ride closed forever on June 28 due to technical problems with the ride. Disassembling occurred that September. In addition, the path leading to Chiller was blocked off and several rides including Freefall, Splashwater Falls/Movietown Water Effect, and a couple other flat rides were removed.

In 2008, in the area occupied by the Movietown Water Effect, a new junior indoor Wild Mouse rollercoaster was added called The Dark Knight. Motion Simulator Ride ended the SpongeBob theming in favor of &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot;. Also Glow in the Park Parade was added to the entertainment lineup.

Medusa was refurbished over the off-season and returned in 2009 as &quot;Bizarro&quot;, a new incarnation of the same ride. The whole coaster, station, and surrounding theme elements were all changed and repainted to go with the new theme of the ride. Bizarro comic strips were put up along the queue line, and special effects and audio were added to the actual ride. The refurbishment brought crowds back to a ride that was beginning to lose its original charm and popularity.

===Weber/Anderson era (2010–2019)===

The theme park&#x27;s parent Six Flags emerged from a 2008–2010 bankruptcy with Al Weber Jr. as an interim CEO and subsequently by Jim Reid-Anderson in August 2010. The company parent also moved its corporate headquarters from New York City back to Texas, where the company started.

For the 2010 season, the Motion Simulator ride &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; did not reopen and was not replaced with anything and remained vacant. In April 2010, rumors also began that the Great American Scream Machine would be removed at the end of the season. By mid-June, rumors were that the coaster would be removed on July 1. That date came and went but on July 5, 2010, via Facebook, Six Flags confirmed the rumored removal of the Great American Scream Machine on July 18, 2010. The ride closed late on that date and was demolished immediately after to make room for &quot;a major new attraction in 2011.&quot; On September 16, 2010, the park announced that the Green Lantern, a standup roller coaster formerly known as Chang at the recently closed Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, would debut in the Boardwalk section for the 2011 season. Green Lantern&#x27;s lift hill and first drop run parallel to the lift hill of Superman Ultimate Flight, which involved the demolition of a rarely used section of the preferred parking area.

In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their license with The Wiggles. Wiggles&#x27; World was renamed and rethemed to Safari Kids in time for the 2011 season. Also in 2011, eruption was removed. Construction for the new Funtime Slingshot replacing eruption started mid-June 2011 and was recently finished a few weeks after.

In 2012, Great Adventure introduced &quot;SkyScreamer&quot;, a Funtime StarFlyer, that soars riders in a circle at speeds over , that opened in the spring of 2012, along with bumper cars, flying elephants, and a musical themed scrambler that opened in the newly transformed area &quot;Adventure Alley&quot; (formerly Fantasy Forest area around the Big Wheel). On February 13, 2012, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in New Jersey announced a new major water attraction &quot;King Cobra&quot;, that is the first in the United States. The ride &quot;Falls&quot; at &quot;Hurricane Harbor&quot; was proposed to get a transformation, giving it a trapdoor release in 2012, but was later cancelled for the new attraction King Cobra. Furthermore, in 2012, Six Flags Great Adventure removed two of its four Johnny Rockets food stands, one located in Plaza Del Carnival and the other in the Boardwalk. Both were replaced with a new food stand named Totally Kickin&#x27; Chicken.

On August 30, 2012, Six Flags combined its Great Adventure Park with its Wild Safari animal park to form the Six Flags Great Adventure &amp; Safari park, the second-largest theme park in the world, after Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom.

A 4th Dimension roller coaster was opened in spring 2016, called The Joker.

In 2017, Six Flags added Justice League: Battle For Metropolis a 4D dark ride.

The ride Cyborg Cyber Spin opened in spring of 2018.

Wonder Woman: Lasso of Truth, a large scale custom Zamperla pendulum ride, was opened in 2019.

During the 2018 off-season, El Diablo was removed from the park and was relocated to La Ronde, where it reopened as Chaos.

In June 2019, the park completed a 23.5 MW solar facility, the largest net-metered solar farm in New Jersey. It produces around 30 million kWh per year, equivalent to most of the park&#x27;s electricity needs. The facility includes 11 MW of solar canopy over the carpark. The facility was announced in March 2015.

===2020–present===
On August 29, 2019, Six Flags announced a new coaster, the Jersey Devil Coaster, to be built by Rocky Mountain Construction. Six Flags suspended all operations across all their properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In mid-May, the park announced that they would reopen the Safari Off Road Adventure as a drive-thru, which reopened on May 30, 2020. Following an announcement by Governor Phil Murphy on June 23, 2020, giving permission for amusement parks to reopen, Six Flags Great Adventure announced a day later that it would reopen on July 3, 2020. However, the Jersey Devil Coaster was delayed until the 2021 season because its construction was halted due to the pandemic.

In July 2021, the park re-introduced the ride&#x27;s old Road Runner Railway kiddie roller coaster to Lil&#x27; Devil Coaster, a ride themed to the Jersey Devil, like the nearby Jersey Devil Coaster. In 2022, the park announced that Bizarro would be re-themed to Medusa, the ride&#x27;s original theme. The park announced in 2023 that it would build a new roller coaster, The Flash: Vertical Velocity, which was scheduled to open in 2024, but was later delayed to 2025.

==Concerts==
Numerous artists have performed concerts at the park, including Bon Jovi, The Ramones, The Beach Boys, Heart, Kansas, Cheap Trick, Joan Jett, and Alice Cooper.

On September 29, 2012, Great Adventure hosted the FestEvil, a festival hosting contemporary metal and hardcore acts; Falling In Reverse and We Came As Romans coheadlined. It was Great Adventure&#x27;s first and last metal show. At the end of the show, Falling In Reverse frontman Ronnie Radke threw three microphone stands into the crowd, injuring two attendees. Radke was arrested after the show, and a spokesperson for Great Adventure announced that the park would no longer host shows with metal bands.

==Attractions==

===Main Street===
Main Street serves as the entry gate for Six Flags Great Adventure. It was originally entitled Liberty Court and was built when the entrance to the park was moved from near what is now the Boardwalk area to a more central location. Main Street is themed as an Early-American town, somewhere around the 18th century. Later additions to Main Street have formed it into more of a turn-of-the-century town. In the front is Main Street Fountain, which serves as a central hub for the park.

===Fantasy Forest===

Fantasy Forest serves as the midway for the park and was originally part of the entrance. Fantasy Forest is designed to make its visitors feel like children, and the section&#x27;s bright colors and fanciful design give it a magical feel. The Yum Yum Cafe, (Previously &quot;The Great Character Cafe&quot;), which is designed to look like a giant ice cream sundae, is in this area along with the colorful Carousel and Enchanted Teacups. Originally, this section was split into two sections; Dream Street, the east side featuring the Carousel, and Strawberry Fair, the west side featuring the Giant Wheel and Fantasy Fling. During Time Warner&#x27;s acquisition of the park, these two sections of the park were combined into one. In 2012, the east side stayed as Fantasy Forest and the west side was re-themed and transformed to Adventure Alley.

===Adventure Alley===
Adventure Alley, made up of what used to be the right half of Fantasy Forest, opened in 2012 along with SkyScreamer, a FunTime StarFlyer. The area has a retro theme and features several classic family rides. It was built in a formerly barren area in response to complaints about there being a lack of family rides in the park. SkyScreamer, DejaVu (a Scrambler relocated from the shuttered American Adventures in Georgia), and Air Jumbo (a Flying Elephants ride relocated from Balin&#x27;s Jungleland in the Golden Kingdom) all opened in May, while Fender Benders, a bumper cars attraction, opened in early July. The area was sponsored by the Broadway show Jersey Boys and as such, features songs from the musical as its soundtrack.
===The Pine Barrens===
The Pine Barrens opened in the park in 2021. It was called Adventure Seaport from 2011 to 2020. It is made up of a children&#x27;s area, Jr. Thrillseekers, and a small section of the park formerly part of Movietown. Originally, The Pine Barrens also included Looney Tunes Seaport before it was removed in 2020.

===Jr. Thrillseekers===
Jr. Thrillseekers was known as &quot;Wiggles World&quot; from 2007 to 2010. Most of the rides were re-themed from Looney Tunes Seaport, while the section itself replaced an aging part of Looney Tunes Seaport and the outdated Riptide flume ride. The area was renamed and re-themed Safari Kids for 2011 when the parks rights to use the Wiggles brand expired. It was renamed to Jr. Thrillseekers in 2022.
===Movietown===
This section makes up what used to be the &quot;Fun Fair&quot; and &quot;Action Town&quot; sections of the park. It is themed as a Hollywood back lot, complete with Hollywood style buildings, and movie-themed ride, shops, stalls, and other attractions. All of the attractions include DC Comics (Batman: The Ride). Over the years, many of the movie props have been removed, and all the flat rides in this section of the park have been moved or dismantled. This left the section with very few rides: the addition of The Dark Knight Coaster meant the removal of the Movietown Water Effect, a themed Splashdown ride. Batman and Robin: The Chiller and Stuntman&#x27;s Freefall (an Intamin free-fall ride) had already been removed, and the &quot;Axis Chemical&quot; themed amphitheater, while still standing, no longer hosts stunt shows. Nitro was included in Movietown until the 2011 season when it became part of Adventure Seaport (The Pine Barrens). For a time this section of the park was essentially a dead-end, forcing patrons to turn back after the Showcase Theater.
The park reopened a pathway between this ride and the Justice League attraction, and now patrons can loop through Movietown and re-emerge near the fountain and the park&#x27;s main entrance. Additionally, Wonder Woman: Lasso of Truth debuted in June 2019, located just next to the old Axis Chemical building.

===Metropolis===
Themed after Metropolis from Superman.
In summer 2016, permits were released for a Justice League: Battle for Metropolis dark ride to be placed where Batman and Robin: The Chiller once stood. The area surrounding Justice League: Battle for Metropolis was rethemed to Metropolis.

===Lakefront===
Lakefront, as its name suggests, is found right on the lake in the back of the property. The rides and structures in Lakefront all have a nautical theme. The section also includes an Asian-themed eatery (called Chop Six).
===Frontier Adventures===
Previously known as &quot;Best of the West&quot; and &quot;Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Rip Roarin&#x27;&quot;, Frontier Adventures is the park&#x27;s western-themed section. It is home to the Fort and the Best of the West restaurant, as well as some of the park&#x27;s rides.

It stands on the former location of the Super Teepee and the Conestoga Wagon.

===Bugs Bunny National Park===

Bugs Bunny National Park opened in 2006 along with El Toro. It has a series of camp-themed rides, all in a rustic area on the lake.
===Plaza del Carnaval===

This area was originally part of Frontier Adventures, and was also called &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; for the opening of Rolling Thunder. This section of the park has heavy Spanish influences, including music, lights, and various structures including the station for El Toro. The whole area is very festive and is filled with vibrant colors, stucco buildings, and Spanish tile roofs.

===Boardwalk===
Previously Fortune Festival, the boardwalk section of Great Adventure has games commonly found on boardwalks, boardwalk restaurants, and the parks two upcharge rides. This area of the park was also previously themed as Edwards Air Force Base. The section also has a slight boardwalk-influence to its rides.
==Former attractions==
==Annual events==
===Fright Fest===

During the Halloween season, Six Flags Great Adventure is redecorated with spider webs, smoke machines, and other Halloween related decorations. Actors dress up in scary costumes and walk around to frighten guests, as they once did at the Haunted Castle. Fright Fest typically begins at 6:00 PM, as the zombies parade to a stage to kick off &quot;fright by night.&quot; The park does not recommend the nighttime activities for children 13 or under. Fright Fest attracts some of the heaviest crowds of the year, and becomes more and more crowded as the date draws closer to Halloween.

One of the most popular attractions at Fright Fest every year is the theatrical production of Dead Man&#x27;s Party, a live dance show with popular music that draws hundreds of viewers for every showing and has attained an almost cult-like local following.

The seasonal event includes upcharge walk-through haunted attractions. Recurring attractions include The Manor, Fears, Wicked Woods, Blood Shed, Big Top Terror, Cell Block 6, and Aftermath. Areas of the park known as &quot;scare zones&quot; include free-roaming zombies are The Bloody Fountain (Main Street), Demon District (Movietown), CarnEvil (Boardwalk), Lady Of The Lake Cemetery (Lakefront), and Bone Butcher Terror-tory (Frontier Adventures).

===Holiday in the Park===
During the Christmas season, Six Flags Great Adventure is redecorated with Christmas related decorations. During this season, only the Main Street, Adventure Alley, Fantasy Forest, Boardwalk, The Pine Barrens, Jr.Trill seekers, Metropolis, and Movie Town sections of the park remain open.

==Awards==
Many of Six Flags Great Adventure&#x27;s most thrilling roller coasters have placed in &quot;Amusement Today&quot; annual Golden Ticket Awards. Below is a table with coasters at Great Adventure and their highest ranking in the Golden Ticket Awards.

In 2012, Six Flags Great Adventure, along with the Garden State Film Festival, was awarded the Tourism Achievement Award. Both were presented the award for their contributions to improving the economy of the bi-county area through the use of tourism.

== Attendance ==
Although Six Flags does not release attendance figures, the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) and other theme park industry analyst companies estimate attendance numbers for the park.

<doc id="250302" wikidata="Q674251" url="?curid=250302" title="Waiting room">
<text>A waiting room or waiting hall is a building, or more commonly a part of a building or a room, where people sit or stand until the event or appointment for which they are waiting begins.

There are two types of physical waiting room. One has individuals leave for appointments one at a time or in small groups, for instance at a doctor&#x27;s office, a hospital triage area, or outside a school headmaster&#x27;s office. The other has people leave en masse such as those at railway stations, bus stations, and airports. Both examples also highlight the difference between waiting rooms in which one is asked to wait (private waiting rooms) and waiting rooms in which one can enter at will (public waiting rooms).

There are also digital waiting rooms that operate within on-line video conferencing applications such as Zoom developed by Zoom Video Communications. This is a virtual waiting room where participants can be held until such time as the host allows them to enter the meeting.

==Order in private rooms==

People in private waiting rooms are queued up based on various methods in different types of waiting rooms. In hospital emergency department waiting areas, patients are triaged by a nurse, and they are seen by the doctor depending on the severity of their medical condition. In a doctor&#x27;s or dentist&#x27;s waiting room, patients are generally seen in the order in which their appointments are for, with the exception of emergency cases, which get seen immediately upon their arrival. In Canada, where there is publicly-provided health care, controversy has arisen when some important people or celebrities have jumped the line (which is supposed to be based on the appointment order or by severity of condition). In some government offices, such as motor vehicle registration offices or social assistance services, there is a &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; approach in which clients take a number when they arrive. The clients are then seen in the order of their number. In the 2010s, some government offices have a triage-based variant of the first-come, first-served approach, in which some clients are seen by the civil servants faster than others, depending on the nature of their service request and/or the availability of civil servants. This approach can lead to frustration for clients who are waiting, because one client who has been waiting for 30 minutes may see another client come in, take a number, and then be seen within five minutes.

In car repair businesses, clients typically wait until their vehicle is repaired; the service manager can only give an estimate of the approximate waiting time. Clients waiting in the entrance or waiting area of a restaurant for a table normally are seated based on whether they have reservations, or for those without reservations, on a first-come, first-served approach; however, important customers or celebrities may be put to the front of the line. In restaurants, customers may also be able to jump the line by giving a large gratuity or bribe to the maitre d&#x27;hotel or head waiter. Some restaurants which are co-located with or combined with a retail store or gift shop ask customers who are waiting for a table to browse in the merchandise section until their table&#x27;s availability is announced on a PA system or via a pager; this strategy can lead to increased purchases in the retail part of the establishment. One combination restaurant/store is the US Cracker Barrel chain. Some restaurants ask customers who are waiting for a table to sit in the restaurant&#x27;s bar or its licensed lounge area; this approach may lead to increased sales of alcoholic beverages.

Waiting rooms may be staffed or unstaffed. In waiting rooms that are staffed, a receptionist or administrative staffer sits behind a desk or counter to greet customers/clients, give them information about the expected waiting period, and answer any questions about their appointment time or the appointment process. In doctors&#x27; or dentists&#x27; waiting rooms, the patients may be able to make additional appointments, pay for appointments, or deal with other administrative tasks with the receptionist or administrator. In police stations, check cashing stores, and some government waiting rooms, the receptionist or administrator is behind a plexiglass barrier, with either small holes to permit communication, or, in higher-security settings, a microphone and speaker. In reception areas with a plexiglass barrier, there may be a heavy-duty drawer to enable the client to provide money or papers to the receptionist and for the receptionist to provide documents to the client. The plexiglass barrier and the drawer system help to protect the receptionists from aggressive or potentially violent clients.

==Amenities==
Most waiting rooms have seating. Some have adjacent toilets. It is not uncommon to find vending machines in public waiting rooms or newspapers and magazines in private waiting rooms. Also common in waiting rooms in the United States or in airports are public drinking fountains. Some waiting rooms have television access or music. The increasing prevalence of mobile devices has led to many waiting rooms providing electric outlets and free Wi-Fi Internet connections, though cybersecurity is a concern as unsecured connections may be vulnerable to attack, tampering, or even simply by piggybacking users who are within range but not waiting. Sometimes found in airports and railway stations are special waiting rooms, often called &quot;lounges&quot;, for those who have paid more. These will generally be less crowded and will have superior seating and better facilities. Waiting rooms for high-end services may provide complimentary drinks and snacks.

==In other media==
===In fiction===
The films &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;The Terminal&quot; use waiting rooms as sets for a large part of their duration. They are used elsewhere in the arts to symbolize waiting in the general sense, to symbolize transitions in life and for scenes depicting emptiness, insignificance or sadness. In the play &quot;No Exit&quot;, by French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, several strangers find themselves waiting in a mysterious room, where they each wonder why; finally, they each realize that they are in Hell, and that their punishment is being forced to be with each other (&quot;L&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les autres&quot;, which translates as &quot;Hell is other people&quot;).

In the 2010 Bollywood film &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, directed by Maneej Premnath and produced by Sunil Doshi, four passengers waiting in a remote South Indian railway station are stranded there on a rainy night. A serial killer is on the prowl, targeting the passengers of the waiting room, creating intense fear among them.

===In video games===
The term &quot;waiting room&quot; also extends to the realm of video games as a similar virtual waiting area where players for an online multiplayer game are placed into while waiting for all remaining players for a game session to be present. A virtual waiting room may be a mere, static loading screen (such as the waiting screens in the mobile game &quot;Star Wars: Force Arena&quot;), or a playable environment in of itself where readied players can practice their skills to pass the time needed for all players to come onboard to begin the session, such as a dedicated &quot;waiting room&quot; arena in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and its subsequent sequels, where players can practice their fighting moves with their chosen character while waiting for other players to arrive.

<text>Shading refers to the depiction of depth perception in 3D models (within the field of 3D computer graphics) or illustrations (in visual art) by varying the level of darkness. Shading tries to approximate local behavior of light on the object&#x27;s surface and is not to be confused with techniques of adding shadows, such as shadow mapping or shadow volumes, which fall under global behavior of light.

==In drawing==
Shading is used traditionally in drawing for depicting a range of darkness by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. Light patterns, such as objects having light and shaded areas, help when creating the illusion of depth on paper. 

There are various techniques of shading, including cross hatching, where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears.

Powder shading is a sketching shading method. In this style, stumping powder and paper stumps are used to draw a picture. (This is also in color.) The stumping powder is smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any shiny particles. The paper to be used should have small grains on it so that the powder remains on the paper.

==In computer graphics==
In computer graphics, shading refers to the process of altering the color of an object/surface/polygon in the 3D scene, based on things like (but not limited to) the surface&#x27;s angle to lights, its distance from lights, its angle to the camera and material properties (e.g. bidirectional reflectance distribution function) to create a photorealistic effect.

Shading is performed during the rendering process by a program called a shader.

===Surface angle to a light source===
Shading alters the colors of faces in a 3D model based on the angle of the surface to a light source or light sources.

The first image below has the faces of the box rendered, but all in the same color. Edge lines have been rendered here as well which makes the image easier to see.

The second image is the same model rendered without edge lines. It is difficult to tell where one face of the box ends and the next begins.

The third image has shading enabled, which makes the image more realistic and makes it easier to see which face is which.
===Types of lighting===

When a shader computes the result color, it uses a lighting model to determine the amount of light reflected at specific points on the surface. Different lighting models can be combined with different shading techniques — while lighting says how much light is reflected, shading determines how this information is used in order to compute the final result. It may for example compute lighting only at specific points and use interpolation to fill in the rest. The shader may also decide about how many light sources to take into account etc.

====Ambient lighting====
An ambient light source represents an omnidirectional, fixed-intensity and fixed-color light source that affects all objects in the scene equally (is omnipresent). During rendering, all objects in the scene are brightened with the specified intensity and color. This type of light source is mainly used to provide the scene with a basic view of the different objects in it. This is the simplest type of lighting to implement, and models how light can be scattered or reflected many times, thereby producing a uniform effect.

Ambient lighting can be combined with ambient occlusion to represent how exposed each point of the scene is, affecting the amount of ambient light it can reflect. This produces diffused, non-directional lighting throughout the scene, casting no clear shadows, but with enclosed and sheltered areas darkened. The result is usually visually similar to an overcast day.

====Point lighting====
Light originates from a single point and spreads outward in all directions.

====Spotlighting====
Models a spotlight: light originates from a single point and spreads outward in a cone.

====Area lighting====
Light originates from a small area on a single plane. (A more realistic model than a point light source.)

==== Directional lighting ====
A directional light source illuminates all objects equally from a given direction, like an area light of infinite size and infinite distance from the scene; there is shading, but cannot be any distance falloff. This is like the sun.

===Distance falloff===

Theoretically, two surfaces which are parallel are illuminated virtually the same amount from a &quot;distant&quot; unblocked light source such as the sun. The distance falloff effect produces images which have more shading and so would be realistic for proximal light sources.

The left image doesn&#x27;t use distance falloff. Notice that the colors on the front faces of the two boxes are &quot;exactly&quot; the same. It may appear that there is a slight difference where the two faces directly overlap, but this is an optical illusion caused by the vertical edge below where the two faces meet.

The right image does use distance falloff. Notice that the front face of the closer box is brighter than the front face of the back box. Also, the floor goes from light to dark as it gets farther away.

==== Calculation ====
Distance falloff can be calculated in a number of ways:
* &quot;Power of the distance&quot; – For a given point at a distance x from the light source, the light intensity received is proportional to .
** &quot;None&quot; () – The light intensity received is the same regardless of the distance between the point and the light source.
** &quot;Linear&quot; () – For a given point at a distance x from the light source, the light intensity received is proportional to .
** &quot;Quadratic&quot; () – This is how light intensity decreases in reality if the light has a free path (i.e. no fog or any other thing in the air that can absorb or scatter the light). For a given point at a distance x from the light source, the light intensity received is proportional to .
* Any number of other mathematical functions may also be used.

===Shading techniques===

During shading a surface normal is often needed for lighting computation. The normals can be precomputed and stored for each vertex of the model.

====Flat shading====
Here, the lighting is evaluated only once for each polygon (usually for the first vertex in the polygon, but sometimes for the centroid for triangle meshes), based on the polygon&#x27;s surface normal and on the assumption that all polygons are flat. The computed color is used for the whole polygon, making the corners look sharp. This is usually used when more advanced shading techniques are too computationally expensive. Specular highlights are rendered poorly with flat shading: If there happens to be a large specular component at the representative vertex, that brightness is drawn uniformly over the entire face. If a specular highlight doesn&#x27;t fall on the representative point, it is missed entirely. Consequently, the specular reflection component is usually not included in flat shading computation.

====Smooth shading====
In contrast to flat shading where the colors change discontinuously at polygon borders, with smooth shading the color changes from pixel to pixel, resulting in a smooth color transition between two adjacent polygons. Usually, values are first calculated in the vertices and bilinear interpolation is used to calculate the values of pixels between the vertices of the polygons. Types of smooth shading include Gouraud shading and Phong shading.

=====Gouraud shading=====
# Determine the normal at each polygon vertex.
# Apply an illumination model to each vertex to calculate the light intensity from the vertex normal.
# Interpolate the vertex intensities using bilinear interpolation over the surface polygon.

Problems:
* Due to lighting being computed only at vertices, the inaccuracies (especially of specular highlights on large triangles) can become too apparent. 
* T-junctions with adjoining polygons can sometimes result in visual anomalies. In general, T-junctions should be avoided.

=====Phong shading=====
Phong shading is similar to Gouraud shading, except that instead of interpolating the light intensities the normals are interpolated between the vertices and the lighting is evaluated per-pixel. Thus, the specular highlights are computed much more precisely than in the Gouraud shading model.

# Compute a normal N for each vertex of the polygon.
# Using bilinear interpolation compute a normal, Ni for each pixel. (Normal has to be renormalized each time.)
# Apply an illumination model to each pixel to calculate the light intensity from Ni.

====Deferred shading====
Deferred shading is a shading technique by which computation of shading is deferred to later stage by rendering in two passes, potentially increasing performance by not discarding expensively shaded pixels. The first pass only captures surface parameters (such as depth, normals and material parameters), the second one performs the actual shading and computes the final colors.

=====Other approaches=====
Both Gouraud shading and Phong shading can be implemented using bilinear interpolation. Bishop and Weimer proposed to use a Taylor series expansion of the resulting expression from applying an illumination model and bilinear interpolation of the normals. Hence, second-degree polynomial interpolation was used. This type of biquadratic interpolation was further elaborated by Barrera et al., where one second-order polynomial was used to interpolate the diffuse light of the Phong reflection model and another second-order polynomial was used for the specular light.

Spherical linear interpolation (Slerp) was used by Kuij and Blake for computing both the normal over the polygon, as well as the vector in the direction to the light source. A similar approach was proposed by Hast, which uses quaternion interpolation of the normals with the advantage that the normal will always have unit length and the computationally heavy normalization is avoided.

====Flat vs. smooth shading====
==Computer vision==

In computer vision, some methods for 3D reconstruction are based on shading, or &quot;shape-from-shading&quot;. Based on an image&#x27;s shading, a three-dimensional model can be reconstructed from a single photograph.

<text>Laurence Saunders (1519 – 8 February 1555) was an English Protestant martyr whose story is recorded in &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;.

==Early life==
Saunders was the son of Thomas Saunders (d. 1528) of Sibbertoft, Northamptonshire, by Margaret, the daughter of Richard Cave (d. 1538) of Stanford, Northamptonshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth Mervin. He had five brothers, the judge Sir Edward Saunders (d.1576), the lawyer and merchant Robert Saunders (d.1559), Joseph Saunders, and the merchants Blase Saunders (d.1581) and Ambrose Saunders (d.1586), and three sisters, Sabine, wife of the merchant John Johnson, Christian (d.1545), wife of Christopher Breten, and Jane, wife of Clement Villiers.

Saunders was educated at Eton and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After graduating BA in 1541 he was apprenticed to Sir William Chester, but soon abandoned mercantile pursuits and continued his studies, proceeding MA in 1544 and obtaining a doctorate in theology. In the early years of the reign of Edward VI he obtained a licence to preach. Being a man of much ability he was very popular, and was appointed reader at Fotheringhay and later at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1553 he was granted the living at All Hallows Bread Street in London where George Marsh was his curate.

Saunders married Elizabeth Kittiwell of Plymouth (date unknown). Their children were John (b. July 6, 1539), Richard (b. 1542), Mary and Elizabeth (twins b. October 29, 1544), George (b. March 8, 1546, and Kittiwell, (b. November 10, 1548). Laurence&#x27;s son John Saunders married Jane Cathaside (January 6, 1563). Their son George (b. May 1, 1574), traveled to Virginia with Capt. John Smith in 1607. George returned to England, gathered his family and went back to Virginia, where George&#x27;s youngest son, Woodward, was born. Woodward eventually settled in Kent County, Kentucky.

==Trial and death==
On 15 October 1553 he preached at Northampton, warning the congregation that &#x27;the errors of the popish religion&#x27; would be restored to the church by Queen Mary I and that England was threatened with the visitation of God for her &#x27;lukewarm indifference in the cause of Christ, and the privileges of his glorious gospel&#x27;.
In October 1554 he was arrested by the order of the bishop of London after having given a sermon at All Hallows Bread Street. After three months imprisonment he was arraigned on 29 January 1555, and convicted of heresy. He was taken to Coventry, and burned at the stake on 8 February 1555. Before being chained to the stake, he kissed it, saying, &#x27;Welcome the cross of Christ, welcome everlasting life!&#x27; The martyrdom of Saunders was said to have been the start of Joyce Lewis&#x27;s conversion and her later martyrdom.

While at Lichfield, Saunders had married a woman named Joanna, by whom he had a son, Samuel. After her husband&#x27;s death Joanna left England in the company of Robert and Lucy Harrington. Lucy Harrington died shortly thereafter, and by 18 June 1556 Joanna had married Robert Harrington.

<doc id="250309" wikidata="Q4056338" url="?curid=250309" title="Automotive industry in the United Kingdom">
<text>The automotive industry in the United Kingdom is now best known for premium and sports car marques including: Aston Martin, McLaren, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mini and Lotus. Specialised sports car companies include: Ariel, BAC, Morgan, Caterham, AC Cars, Gordan Murray, TVR, Noble, Radical, Ginetta, Ultima Sports, Westfield, Lister, Arash and David Brown. Volume car manufacturers with a major presence in the UK include: Nissan, Toyota, Mini and Vauxhall. Commercial vehicle manufacturers active in the UK include Alexander Dennis, Dennis Eagle, IBC Vehicles, Leyland Trucks, TEVVA and the London Electric Vehicle Company.

In 2018 the UK automotive manufacturing sector had a turnover of £82 billion, generated £18.6 billion in value to the UK economy and produced around 1.5 million passenger vehicles and 85,000 commercial vehicles. In that year around 168,000 people were directly employed in automotive manufacturing in the UK, with a further 823,000 people employed in automotive supply, retail and servicing.
The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing, and in 2018 around 2.71 million engines were produced in the country. The UK has a significant presence in auto racing and the UK motorsport industry currently employs around 38,500 people, comprises around 4,500 companies and has an annual turnover of around £6 billion.

The origins of the UK automotive industry date back to the final years of the 19th century. By the 1950s, the UK was the second-largest manufacturer of cars in the world (after the United States), and the largest exporter. However, in subsequent decades the industry experienced considerably lower growth than competitor nations such as France, Germany and Japan, and by 2008 the UK was the 12th-largest producer of cars measured by volume. Since the early 1990s, many British car marques have been invested in by international companies including BMW (Mini and Rolls-Royce), Tata (Jaguar and Land Rover) and Volkswagen Group (Bentley).

Famous and iconic British cars include the Aston Martin DB5, Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Bentley 4½ Litre, Jaguar E-Type, Land Rover Defender, Lotus Esprit, McLaren F1, MGB, original two-door Mini, Range Rover, Rolls-Royce Phantom III and Rover P5. Notable British car designers include David Bache, Dick Burzi, Laurence Pomeroy, John Polwhele Blatchley, Ian Callum, Colin Chapman, Alec Issigonis, Charles Spencer King and Gordon Murray.

== History ==

=== 1880 to 1900 ===

The inception of the British motor industry can be traced back to the mid-1880s when there were several key developments. One development was when Frederick Simms, a London-based consulting engineer, became friends with Gottlieb Daimler, who had, in 1885, patented a successful design for a high-speed petrol engine. Simms acquired the British rights to Daimler&#x27;s engine and associated patents and from 1891 successfully sold launches using these Cannstatt-made motors from Eel Pie Island in the Thames. In 1893 he formed &quot;The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited&quot; for his various Daimler-related enterprises.

In June 1895, Simms and his friend Evelyn Ellis promoted motor cars in the United Kingdom by bringing a Daimler-engined &quot;Panhard &amp; Levassor&quot; to England and in July it completed, without police intervention, the first British long-distance motorcar journey from Southampton to Malvern.

Simms&#x27; documented plans to manufacture Daimler motors and Daimler Motor Carriages (in Cheltenham) were taken over, together with his company and its Daimler licences, by London company-promoter H J Lawson. Lawson contracted to buy &quot;The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited&quot; and all its rights and on 14 January 1896 formed and in February successfully floated in London &quot;The Daimler Motor Company Limited&quot;. It then purchased from a friend of Lawson a disused cotton mill in Coventry for car engine and chassis manufacture where, it is claimed, the UK&#x27;s first serial production car was made.
George Lanchester produced one of the first British cars between 1895 and 1896 having a single-cylinder 1306cc engine, he went on to sell the first car with disc brakes. In 1891 Richard Stephens, a mining engineer from South Wales, returned from a commission in Michigan to establish a bicycle works in Clevedon, Somerset. Whilst in the United States, he had seen the developments in motive power and by 1897 he had produced his first car. This was entirely of his own design and manufacture, including the two-cylinder engine, apart from the wheels which he bought from Starley in Coventry. This was probably the first all-British car and Stephens set up a production line, manufacturing in all, twelve vehicles, including four- and six-seater cars and hackneys, and nine-seater buses.

Early motor vehicle development in the UK had been effectively stopped by a series of Locomotive Acts introduced during the 19th century which severely restricted the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on the public highways. Following intense advocacy by motor vehicle enthusiasts, including Harry J. Lawson of Daimler, the worst restrictions of these acts, (the need for each vehicle to be accompanied by a crew of three, and a speed limit in towns), was lifted by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896. Under this regulation, &quot;light locomotives&quot; (those vehicles under 3 tons unladen weight) were exempt from the previous restrictions, and a higher speed limit – was set for them. To celebrate the new freedoms Lawson organised the Emancipation Run held on 14 November 1896, the day the new Act came into force. This occasion has been commemorated since 1927 by the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

===1900 to 1939===

The early British vehicles of the late-nineteenth century relied mainly upon developments from Germany and France. By 1900 however, the first all-British 4-wheel car had been designed and built by Herbert Austin as manager of The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company. In 1901, backed by (Vickers Limited) brothers &#x27;Colonel Tom&#x27; and Albert Vickers [la], Austin started what became Wolseley Motors in Birmingham and was the UK&#x27;s largest car manufacturer until Ford overtook them in 1913.

The great bulk of the pioneering car producers, many of them from the bicycle industry, got off to a shaky start. Of the 200 British makes of car that had been launched up until 1913, only about 100 of the firms were still in existence. In 1910, UK vehicle production was 14,000 units. By 1913, Henry Ford had built a new factory in Manchester and was the leading UK carmaker, building 7,310 cars that year, followed by Wolseley at 3,000, Humber (making cars since 1898 in Coventry) at 2,500, Rover (Coventry car maker since 1904) at 1,800 and Sunbeam (producing cars since 1901) at 1,700, with the plethora of smaller producers bringing the 1913 total up to about 16,000 vehicles. Car production virtually came to an end during the war years 1914–1918, although the requirements of war production led to the development of new mass-production techniques in the motor industry.
By 1922, there were 183 motor companies in the UK, and by 1929, following the slump years, there were 58 companies remaining. In 1929, production was dominated by Morris (founded by William Morris in 1910 in Oxford) and Austin (founded by Herbert Austin in Birmingham in 1905 after he left Wolseley) which between them produced around 60% of total UK output. Singer (Coventry motorcycle manufacturer started building cars in 1905) followed in third place that year with 15% of production.

In 1932, the UK overtook France to become Europe&#x27;s largest car producer (a position which it retained until 1955). In 1937, the UK produced 379,310 passenger cars and 113,946 commercial vehicles. To celebrate the granting of his peerage, William Morris upon becoming Viscount Nuffield, reorganised his motor vehicle companies in 1938, which by then included not only Morris Motors and MG, but also Wolseley and Riley (bicycle company founded in Coventry in 1890 and making cars since 1906), into the Nuffield Organization. In 1939, the top producers were Morris: 27%, Austin: 24%, Ford: 15%, Standard (founded in Coventry in 1903): 13%, Rootes (which had acquired Humber and Sunbeam): 11%, Vauxhall (building cars since 1903, acquired by GM in 1925): 10%.

===1939 to 1955===

During the Second World War, car production in the UK gave way to commercial and military vehicle production, and many motor vehicle plants were converted to aircraft and aero engine production. Following the war, the UK Government had nationalised the steel industry; where priority was given to supplying foreign-revenue-raising export businesses. In 1947, steel was available only to businesses which exported at least 75% of their production. This, coupled with the inevitably limited competition from continental Europe, and with demand for new vehicles in America and in Australia being greater than the American industry alone could supply, resulted in British vehicle exports reaching record levels and the UK became the world&#x27;s largest motor vehicle exporter. In 1937, the UK provided 15% of world vehicle exports. By 1950, a year in which 75% of British car production and 60% of its commercial vehicle production was exported, the UK provided 52% of the world&#x27;s exported vehicles.

This situation remained until the mid-1950s, by which time the American industry production had caught up with American demand, and European production was recovering. By 1952, the American-owned producers in the UK (Ford and GM&#x27;s Vauxhall) had between them a 29% share of the British market, which exceeded the share of either of the UK&#x27;s two top domestically owned manufacturers. It was in that context that Viscount Nuffield agreed to the merger of his company, the Nuffield Organization, with Austin, to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Thus BMC, comprising Austin, Morris, MG, Riley and Wolseley was formed in 1952 and commanded a 40% share of the British market. German production was increasing yearly, and by 1953 it had exceeded that of France, and by 1956 it had overtaken that of the UK.

===1955 to 1968===

By 1955 five companies produced 90% of the UK&#x27;s motor vehicle output: BMC, Ford, Rootes, Standard-Triumph and Vauxhall. Of the dozen or so smaller producers Rover and Jaguar were strong niche producers. By 1960 the UK had dropped from being the world&#x27;s second largest motor vehicle producer into third place. Labour-intensive methods, and wide model ranges hindered opportunities to reduce manufacturing costs – the UK&#x27;s unit costs were higher than those of their major Japanese, European and American competitors. Although rationalisation of motor vehicle companies had started, full integration did not occur. BMC continued to produce vehicles under the marque names of its incorporated companies, many of which competed with each other. Standard-Triumph&#x27;s attempts to reduce costs by embracing a modern volume production strategy almost led to their bankruptcy in 1960, the result was that they were purchased by the commercial vehicle manufacturing company Leyland Motors. In 1966, BMC and Jaguar came together, to form British Motor Holdings (BMH). Leyland had achieved some sales success with Leyland-Triumph and in 1967 it acquired Rover. By 1966 the UK had slipped to become the world&#x27;s fourth largest motor vehicle producer. Following a gradual process which had begun in 1964, Chrysler UK (CUK) had fully acquired Rootes by 1967.

In the context of BMC&#x27;s wide, complex, and expensive-to-produce model range, Ford&#x27;s conventionally designed Cortina challenging for the number one spot in the domestic market, and the heavy reliance of the British economy on motor vehicle production, in 1968 the Government brokered the merger of the successful Leyland-Triumph-Rover and the struggling BMH, to form Europe&#x27;s fourth-largest car maker, the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). The new company announced its intention to invest in a new volume car range, and to equip its factories with the latest capital-intensive production methods.

BMC&#x27;s Mini, designed by Alec Issigonis, had revolutionized the small car market in 1959, and the car remained among the UK&#x27;s best selling cars for more than 20 years after its launch, the last version finally rolling off the production line on 4 October 2000 after a run of 41 years. The Rootes Group launched the similar-sized Hillman Imp four years later, but by the end of the 1960s Ford and Vauxhall had yet to launch a comparable product, and even with foreign imports slowly starting to gain ground on the British market, Italy&#x27;s Fiat 500 was one of the few comparable alternatives to the virtual monopoly of the Mini and Hillman Imp in this sector of the market.
Also designed by Alec Issigonis was the Morris Minor, which was heavily updated in 1956 having originally gone into production in 1948. It earned a reputation for low running costs, good reliability and competitive pricing, and continued to sell well throughout the 1960s in spite of the popularity of BMC&#x27;s 1100/1300 range which was launched in 1962, The Morris Minor was also the first British car to reach one million in production in 1961 with this record number reached a special model of the Morris Minor was created and sent to all of the main dealerships under the name &quot;Morris Million&quot;.

Ford&#x27;s competitor in this sector was the Anglia, which featured unconventional styling but was still one of the country&#x27;s most successful cars from its launch in 1959 up to the end of production in 1967, after which it was replaced by the Escort. Other British competitors in this sector were the Vauxhall Viva and Hillman Minx.

Larger family cars enjoyed strong sales in the 1960s, namely the Ford Cortina (launched in 1962), Austin/Morris 1800 (1964) and Vauxhall Victor (1957). Later in the 1960s, the Rootes Group launched a new competitor in this growing sector of the market - the Hillman Hunter.

The Rover P6, launched in 1963 and the first winner of the European Car of the Year award, was arguably the most popular luxury model in the UK during the 1960s.
The iconic Jaguar E-Type sports car, designed by Malcolm Sayer, with a top speed of and the choice of a coupe or roadster bodystyle, was launched in 1961 and would remain in production until 1975. Cheaper sports cars also enjoyed strong sales during the 1960s, including the MG B and Triumph Spitfire which were launched in the early part of the decade, and the Ford Capri which was launched just before the decade&#x27;s end.

The 1960s saw a slow but sure increase in the popularity of foreign cars on the British market. Volkswagen of West Germany had imported the iconic Beetle to Britain since 1953; this car was first launched in 1937 as a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; for the German market under the Nazi regime. Its arrival on the UK market less than a decade after the end of World War II was met with hostility, with many examples being vandalised soon after being distributed, but it quickly became popular, with nearly 10,000 being sold in 1959. Volkswagen also began importing examples of its people carrier and van models, and by 1963 had sold 100,000 cars in Britain.Renault of France had actually built UK market versions of its cars at a site in Acton, West London, from 1902 until 1962, but its popularity actually increased after the end of UK production, helped by the arrival of the Renault 4 minicar in 1961 and the world&#x27;s first production hatchback model, the Renault 16, in 1965. By the end of the decade, it had launched a smaller hatchback model, the Renault 6, and a mid-range saloon, the Renault 12, and was continuing to grow in popularity. Renault&#x27;s French rival Peugeot also enjoyed success in the 1960s with its 404 saloon and even more so with its successor, the 504, which was launched in 1968. This set the scene for even more sales for foreign carmakers on the UK market during the next two decades, as their market share continued to grow.

Japanese cars also started to appear on the UK market during the 1960s, although they were a rare on British roads until exploding in popularity during the early 1970s. The Daihatsu Compagno was the first Japanese car to be sold in Britain when imports began during 1964. This car was not popular with British buyers and was withdrawn from sale within a few years, although Daihatsu would return to the UK market in the early 1980s. A year later, Toyota became the second Japanese carmaker to import cars to Britain. It was followed shortly afterwards by Nissan (which used the Datsun brand for the UK market) and Mazda. Honda was also enjoying great success on the motorcycle market by this stage, although it didn&#x27;t start importing passenger cars to the UK until 1972.

===1968 to 1987===

By 1968, UK motor vehicle production was dominated by four companies: BLMC, Chrysler (UK), Ford, and Vauxhall (GM). The Rootes Group had taken on the name Chrysler UK after its takeover by the American car giant Chrysler, which had also taken over French carmaker Simca.

The national champion, BLMC (British Leyland from 1968), was handicapped in its attempts to modernise by internal rivalries. Unattractive new products (particularly the Austin Allegro and Morris Marina) which were widely criticised by the motoring press, retention of legacy marques and models, labour disputes, quality issues, supplier problems and inefficient use of new equipment thwarted the dream of efficient high volume production. Increased overseas competition and high unit costs led to lowered profits, which in turn jeopardised investment plans. Although the cars continued to sell well in Britain, they were less popular on overseas markets. As well as that, the company often produced several cars to compete in the same market sector. For instance, it produced four competitors for the Ford Cortina at the same time - the Morris Marina, Austin Maxi, Triumph Dolomite and the Princess.

Japanese cars, particularly the Datsun badged cars built by Nissan enjoyed a strong surge in popularity during the first half of the 1970s, while French carmaker Renault and West German carmaker Volkswagen also enjoyed an upturn on the British market, helped by the arrival of well-received new cars, particularly the Renault 5 in 1972 and the Volkswagen Golf in 1974.

The fortunes of foreign carmakers on the British market were also assisted by the fact that most British manufacturers adopted the hatchback bodystyle, mostly featuring front-wheel drive, considerably later than their continental rivals. For instance, the arrival of the front-wheel drive Volkswagen Golf hatchback in 1974 came four years before any of the four British-based carmakers had launched an equivalent car. By the time the first small British-built hatchback, the Vauxhall Chevette, was launched in 1975, the French Renault 5 had already been in production for three years. However, British Leyland&#x27;s larger Austin Maxi had been sold with a hatchback and front-wheel drive since its 1969 launch, although it sold similar-sized cars like the Morris Marina and Triumph Dolomite alongside it as a rear-wheel drive saloon alternative, with the Dolomite being sold further upmarket than the Marina. For buyers wanting six-cylinder and larger four-cylinder engines, the Princess was launched in 1975. Chrysler launched the Alpine for this market sector in 1975, featuring front wheel drive and a hatchback, but kept the Hunter in production alongside it until 1979 for buyers who still preferred rear-wheel drive and a saloon or estate bodystyle.

At the luxury end of the market, British Leyland was actually one of the first manufacturers in the world to put a hatchback on an upmarket car when it launched the Rover SD1 in 1976. This car signalled the beginning of rationalisation at British Leyland, with the SD1 replacing two model ranges - the Rover P6 and Triumph 2000/2500.

The popularity of Nissan&#x27;s range of Datsun-badged cars in the 1970s was largely down to their low prices, cheap running costs, good equipment levels and a reputation for better reliability than most British cars, although these cars also went on to gain a reputation for being prone to rust.

BLMC&#x27;s share of the UK market dropped from 40% to 32% between 1971 and 1973, with its new Morris Marina and Austin Allegro family cars selling well on the British market but not proving popular on many export markets, with the motoring media being critical of the styling of these new models as well as questions regarding the level of quality.
By 1974, the UK&#x27;s position as a world motor vehicle manufacturer had dropped to sixth place. In 1974, both BLMC and Chrysler UK appealed to the UK Government for financial help. The Government rejected the idea of a merger between the two companies, and instead Chrysler UK received a loan and BLMC was subjected to a series of studies to determine its future. The Government&#x27;s official BLMC enquiry, led by Lord Ryder, suggested that BLMC&#x27;s strategy was sound, but required huge state investment to improve productivity by providing mechanisation and improving labour relations.

Despite the effective nationalisation of BLMC as British Leyland (BL) in 1975, the recovery never happened. Chrysler sold its European interests (including those in the UK) to Peugeot in 1978, to allow it to concentrate on its own difficulties in the United States. The UK interests were renamed Peugeot-Talbot, with production of the Chrysler-developed cars continuing, with the last Rootes-developed car, the Avenger, being discontinued in 1981. Peugeot also developed a saloon version of the Alpine called the Solara, and also launched the larger Tagora, which had been in development by Chrysler when it sold its European operations. It also replaced the entry-level Sunbeam with the Peugeot based Samba in 1981.

As in most other developed countries, the 1970s saw major changes to the cars produced in the UK. Front-wheel drive, which had been pioneered by BMC on several new models between 1959 and 1965, now became a common feature on family cars after decades of producing only rear-wheel drive models. The hatchback bodystyle, which had debuted in Europe on the French Renault 16 in 1965, became more popular, with many of Britain&#x27;s best-selling cars being available with a hatchback by the early-1980s.

Many Ford and Vauxhall models were also being produced at their parent company&#x27;s continental factories by 1980. Ford had switched Capri and Granada production to Germany by this stage, while production of its new Fiesta supermini was divided between Britain, West Germany and a new plant in Spain from its 1976 launch. General Motors had not only decided to make its Vauxhall and Opel badged cars mechanically identical during the 1970s, but it had also imported some of its Vauxhall-badged cars from Opel factories in West Germany and Belgium, and its Corsa supermini (Vauxhall Nova in the UK) was solely assembled at a factory in Zaragoza, Spain, which opened in 1982. British Leyland&#x27;s overseas outposts in countries like Italy (where cars were produced under the Innocenti brand) were gradually closed down or sold to other carmakers, so by the 1980s; it was entirely a British-based operation.
By the end of the 1970s, Ford, Peugeot-Talbot and Vauxhall (GM) were well-integrated with their parent companies&#x27; other European operations. BL stood alone in the UK as an increasingly junior player. As part of the drive for increased productivity in the late-1970s, BL reduced its workforce and number of plants, and strived to centralise its management activities. The city of Coventry suffered particularly badly, with many thousands becoming unemployed after the closure of the Triumph car factory in the city in 1980.

In 1979, BL struck a collaboration deal with Honda to share the development and production of a new mid-sized car (Triumph Acclaim/Honda Ballade), which was launched in 1981. The new car combined Honda engine and transmission designs with a BL body, as did its successor model - the Rover 200 Series - in 1984. The next plan was to work on a new luxury car together, the end product being the Rover 800 Series, which arrived in 1986.

Although UK politics changed in 1979 with the election of the Conservative Party, the UK Government continued to support BL with funds for the development of a new mass-market model range (Mini Metro, Maestro, Montego and another Honda collaboration the Rover 800), which were all launched between 1980 and 1986. The Metro was the most successful of these cars.

Car assembly, with the exception of Jaguar, was concentrated into two central plants – Longbridge and Cowley. In July 1986, BL was renamed the Rover Group.

By the mid-1980s, front-wheel drive was now the standard on mass market cars, with most new models having a hatchback bodystyle as at least an option. Although Ford had adopted front-wheel drive for its new Spanish built Fiesta supermini in 1976 and the third generation Escort in 1980, it had curiously retained rear-wheel drive for its larger Sierra (the Cortina replacement) in 1982, although the Sierra did feature a hatchback bodystyle and was not available as a saloon until 1987. In 1983, it recognised the continuing demand for smaller and medium-sized family saloons by introducing the Orion, which was based on the Escort floorpan.
The supermini sector had expanded rapidly since the early-1970s. BMC&#x27;s Mini had remained popular beyond its twentieth anniversary, but successor organisation British Leyland had started work on a more modern and practical alternative by the mid-1970s, the final result being the Austin Metro in 1980 - the new car featured more modern styling and a hatchback bodystyle. Chrysler Europe had axed the long-running Hillman Imp (launched by the Rootes Group in 1963) in 1976 and replaced it with the Chrysler Sunbeam hatchback a year later. General Motors had already adopted this bodystyle with the Vauxhall Chevette (which was also available as a saloon or estate) and Ford with the Fiesta. Comparable foreign products like the Fiat 127, Renault 5 and Volkswagen Polo were also proving popular in the UK.

Ford had now divided its European operations between its British factories and other European plants in Spain, Belgium and West Germany. General Motors had started importing some of its West German and Belgian built Opel products to the UK to be badged as Vauxhalls, and by 1983 its Nova supermini (badged as the Opel Corsa on the continent) was built solely in its Spanish factory. Peugeot was dividing production of most of the Talbot badged vehicles between the Ryton plant near Coventry (the Linwood plant in Scotland closed in 1981) and its French factories by the early-1980s, and started producing its own models at Coventry in 1985 after deciding to axe the Talbot marque due to falling sales.

Foreign carmakers continued to gain ground on the British market during the 1980s, with the likes of Renault, Peugeot, Citroen (France), Volvo (Sweden), Volkswagen (West Germany) and Fiat (Italy) proving particularly popular.

The Russian-built Lada, first sold in the UK in 1974, also sold well, despite its outdated Fiat-sourced design; with buyers mostly being attracted by its low price. By the late-1980s, with the four-wheel drive Niva and a front-wheel drive hatchback, the Samara, complementing the long-running Riva, Lada sales in Britain had amounted to more than 30,000 a year (some 1.5% of the new car market), but tailed off after 1990 as a result of growing competition and a lack of new model launches. Imports to Britain finally ceased in 1997 due to Lada&#x27;s difficulties in meeting emissions requirements. Skoda also enjoyed similarly decent sales of its well-priced rear-engined saloon cars during the 1970s and 1980s, going from strength to strength in the 1990s following its takeover by Volkswagen and the launch of new model ranges with modern technology and styling. Zastava&#x27;s Yugo-badged cars, based on Fiat designs from the 1970s, also sold reasonably well in Britain during the 1980s, but the carmaker was forced to halt imports in 1992 due to sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia as a result of the civil war there. Polish carmaker FSO imported its version of the Fiat 125 to Britain from 1975, later launching a hatchback model (the Polonez) alongside it. However, by 1998, Skoda was the only Eastern European carmaker still exporting cars to Britain, now competing with budget-priced Asian cars from the likes of Daewoo, Kia, Hyundai and Proton.

Nissan had axed the Datsun brand by 1984 and used its own name on all cars, and in 1986 opened a factory in Britain near Sunderland, which produced the mid-range Bluebird hatchbacks and saloons, although it was the Japanese-built Micra which was the company&#x27;s best-selling car in Britain during the 1980s.
The decade also saw the arrival of purpose-built people carriers on the British market, starting with the Japanese Mitsubishi Space Wagon in 1984, and then the market-leading Renault Espace in 1985, but by the end of the decade this type of vehicle still had only a very small share of the British market and there were still no British-built people carriers available, although a few seven-seater estate models including Austin Rover&#x27;s Montego were being produced.

The decade also saw a fall in demand for sports cars, perhaps due to the rising popularity of &quot;hot hatchbacks&quot; (high performance versions of hatchback cars), and so a number of manufacturers pulled out of the sports car market. British Leyland finished production of its MG and Triumph sports cars early in the decade, with no replacement. General Motors had launched coupe versions of its Cavalier mid-range model in the 1970s, but did not produce any equivalent models of the MK2 Cavalier which arrived in 1981. It did, however, continue to offer the German-built Opel Manta to British buyers until the end of production in 1988, replacing it with the Calibra (also built in Germany) a year later. Ford had enjoyed success in the 1970s with its Capri coupe, but this declined in popularity after 1980 and when production ended in 1986, there was no direct replacement.

As well as the rebranding of the former Rootes Group and its eventual integration into Peugeot, the 1980s also saw the disappearance of several long-established car brands. Production of MG sports cars finished when the Abingdon factory closed in 1980, although the brand was quickly revived on higher performance versions of the Metro, Maestro and Montego. 1980 also saw the closure of the Triumph factory at Canley, Coventry, although the marque survived until 1984 - the same year that the Morris marque was discontinued after more than seventy years. The Morris Ital&#x27;s successor, the Montego, was sold under the Austin and MG brands, while the Triumph Acclaim&#x27;s successor was sold as the Rover 200 Series. By 1988, however, the Austin marque had also been phased out, with the former Austin-badged products now being incorporated into the Rover brand.

General Motors enjoyed an upturn in Britain during the 1980s, as its Vauxhall-badged cars increased their market share and the company&#x27;s image also improved. At the beginning of 1980, it replaced the Viva with a new front-wheel drive range of hatchback and estates - the Astra, which was built in Britain and also in Opel factories on the continent. The MK2 Cavalier was launched in 1981, and became the company&#x27;s best selling car of the decade. Its replacement for the Chevette was the Nova, a rebadged version of the Spanish built Opel Corsa, which was launched in 1983. The MK2 Astra was voted European Car of the Year shortly after its launch in 1984, as was the flagship MK2 Carlton (Opel Omega on the continent) two years later.

===1987 to 2001===

In July 1986, Nissan became the first Japanese carmaker to set up a production facility in Europe, when it opened a new plant in Sunderland. The plant initially produced the Bluebird and from 1990 its successor, the Primera, with the MK2 Micra joining it in 1992. Toyota opened a new plant in Burnaston near Derby at the beginning of 1992.

Peugeot started production of the Peugeot 309 hatchback at Ryton (originally a Rootes Group factory) in October 1985, followed by the Peugeot 405 two years later. During the 1990s, production of the 306 and 206 also began at Ryton.

Honda&#x27;s venture with Austin Rover/Rover Group saw a number of different designs shared between the two marques. The venture came to an end in February 1994 when British Aerospace sold Rover Group to the German carmaker BMW for £800 million. The takeover meant that, for the first time in 112 years, the United Kingdom no longer had a British-owned volume car maker. BMW&#x27;s ownership of the Rover Group saw the development of several newer, more upmarket models, giving the British brand an image to match that of its parent company. BMW also revived the MG marque in 1995 on a new affordable sports car, the MGF, as well as strengthening Land Rover&#x27;s position in the off-roader market. In March 2000 BMW controversially announced the break-up of the Rover Group. It retained the rights to the Mini marque, while selling Land Rover to Ford. The MG and Rover marques were sold to the Phoenix Consortium, who branded the remains of the group as MG Rover and concentrated all production at the Longbridge plant. After the split from Rover, Honda continued making the Civic range in the UK at a new plant in Swindon.
Ford acquired Aston Martin for an undisclosed sum in September 1987 and Jaguar for US$2.38 billion in November 1989. Production of the new small Jaguar, the X type, started at Halewood in late 2000. By the end of the century, Ford had also acquired Land Rover.

In 1998 Vickers plc put Rolls-Royce Motors, including Bentley, up for auction. Volkswagen Group won the auction with a bid of US$780 million, but Rolls-Royce plc, which had the right to block a transfer of the Rolls-Royce name to non-British owners, agreed to sell the rights to BMW for US$65 million. It was subsequently agreed that control of the Rolls-Royce marque would pass from Volkswagen to BMW in 2003.

In 1995, Ford finally entered the decade-old people carrier market with its Galaxy, which was built in Portugal alongside the identical Volkswagen Sharan and Seat Alhambra as part of a venture between Ford and Volkswagen. Vauxhall entered this sector of the market a year later with the American-built Sintra, but this was not popular with British buyers and was discontinued after just three years when the smaller, German-built Zafira was launched, and proved far more popular than Vauxhall&#x27;s original entry into the MPV market.

The affordable sports car market enjoyed a revival in the 1990s after going into virtual hibernation in the 1980s. Sparked by the popularity of the Japanese-built Mazda MX-5 after its launch in 1989, Rover began development on a new sports car in the early 1990s, finally launching the MG F two-seater roadster in 1995, 15 years after the demise of the last volume MG sports cars. The 1996 Lotus Elise also enjoyed relatively strong sales in this market sector, as did the Vauxhall VX220 (based on the Elise) which was launched in 2000. Ford, which had exited the sports car market by 1987 with the demise of the Capri to concentrate on faster versions of its best-selling hatchbacks and saloons, returned to this market sector in 1994 with the American-built Probe, and then enjoyed more success with its smaller Puma between 1997 and 2002.

===2001 to 2011===

In May 2000 Ford announced that passenger car assembly as its Ford Dagenham plant would cease in 2002, ending 90 years of Ford passenger car assembly in the UK. At the same time Ford announced that it would invest US$500 million in the expansion of a diesel engine factory at the site, making Dagenham its largest diesel engine center worldwide and creating about 500 new jobs to offset the 1,900 lost in vehicle assembly for a total loss of 1,400. In December 2004 Ford announced a further investment of £169 million in the Dagenham plant, increasing annual output to one million diesel engines.

The closure of Vauxhall&#x27;s Luton car assembly plant in March 2003 left Ellesmere Port as the sole Vauxhall assembly plant remaining in the UK. General Motors also retained the former Bedford works in Luton for producing vans such as the Vivaro and the Movano as well as Renault and Nissan badged variants. In April 2007, it was confirmed that the Ellesmere Port would produce the next generation Astra from 2010.

Losses at Jaguar led to closure of the company&#x27;s Browns Lane plant in Coventry in 2004. Spare capacity at Halewood allowed Land Rover Freelander production to be transferred there in 2006.

MG Rover spent the early part of the 2000s investigating possible ventures with other carmakers in order to develop a new range of cars. Proposed links with foreign organisations including Malaysian carmaker Proton failed to materialise, and by late 2004 Chinese carmaker SAIC Motor had shown an interest in taking over the Longbridge-based firm – which was now hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. Talks broke down and the firm went into receivership in April 2005 with the loss of more than 6,000 jobs. Three months later, the firm&#x27;s assets were purchased by another Chinese carmaker – Nanjing Automobile – and Longbridge partially re-opened over the summer of 2007 with an initial workforce of around 250 preparing to restart production of the MG TF which was relaunched in August 2008.
In April 2006 Peugeot closed its Ryton plant and moved 206 production to Slovakia. In 2007, Ford sold Aston Martin to a British-led Consortium backed by Middle East investors, retaining a small stake in the company and agreeing to continue the supply of components including engines. In 2008 Ford sold Jaguar Land Rover to Tata Motors of India for £1.15 billion. In November 2009, Dutch sportscar maker Spyker Cars announced that it would be moving production from Zeewolde to Whitley, Coventry, and UK production began in February 2010.

In March 2010 McLaren Automotive unveiled its MP4-12C model, alongside plans to produce around 4,000 cars per year at its Woking factory by the middle of the decade. At the Paris Motor Show in September 2010 Lotus Cars unveiled five new models due to go on sale by 2016, alongside plans for an investment of £770 million over 10 years, the complete redevelopment of its Hethel factory and an increase in production from under 3,000 cars per year to 6,000 to 7,000. In December 2010 it was announced that Renault had sold its remaining 25% shareholding in its eponymous Formula 1 team to Lotus Cars, and that the team would be renamed Lotus Renault in 2011.

=== 2011 to 2019 ===

In January 2011 BMW announced that it would be extending the Mini range with the launch of two new two-door sports crossover vehicles based on the Mini Paceman concept car, with a coupe version to enter production in 2011 and a roadster in 2012. In March 2011 Jaguar Land Rover announced that it would be hiring an additional 1,500 staff at its Halewood plant, and signed over £2 billion of supply contracts with UK-based companies, to enable production of its new Range Rover Evoque model. In April 2011 the MG Motor subsidiary of SAIC Motor announced that mass production had resumed at the Longbridge plant, as the first MG 6 to be produced in the United Kingdom came off the production line. In May 2011 Jaguar unveiled plans to build the C-X75 petrol-electric hybrid supercar in the UK from 2013, with production to be in association with Williams Grand Prix Engineering; Jaguar announced the cancellation of the project in December 2012 due to the ongoing global economic crisis.

In May 2011, Aston Martin Lagonda confirmed that it was planning to revive the Lagonda marque, with the launch of two or three new models. In an interview with Reuters in the same month, Carl-Peter Forster, the Chief Executive of Tata Motors, revealed that Jaguar Land Rover would be investing over £5 billion in product development over the succeeding five years.

In June, Nissan announced that the replacement for its Qashqai model would be designed and built in the UK, in a total investment of £192 million safeguarding around 6,000 jobs. In June BMW announced an investment of £500 million in the UK over the subsequent three years as part of an expansion of the Mini range to seven models. In September 2011, Jaguar Land Rover confirmed that it would be investing £355 million in the construction of a new engine plant near Wolverhampton, to manufacture a new family of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. Later in the same month it was announced that the Jensen marque would be revived, with a new version of the Interceptor to be built by CPP Holdings at the former Jaguar factory Browns Lane in Coventry. In November, Toyota announced plans to make the UK its sole European manufacturing base for hatchback versions of its next C-segment family car, resulting in the investment of over £100 million in its Burnaston plant and the creation of around 1,500 new jobs.
In September 2013 it was announced that a new National Automotive Innovation Campus would be built at the University of Warwick&#x27;s main campus at a cost of £100 million, with £45 million to be contributed by Jaguar Land Rover.

In the half-year from January to June 2014, the UK had its best year in new car sales in 9 years. 1.28 million new cars were sold during the period, a rise of 10% compared to the same period in 2013. In 2014, more than 1.5 million cars were produced, the highest since 2007.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) figures show a total of 2.31 million new cars were registered in 2019, down 2.4% from the year before. It was the third consecutive year of decline, and the SMMT expects that trend to continue in 2020.

In the year 2019, the best selling vehicle in the UK was Ford Fiesta, followed by Volkswagen Golf, Ford Transit, Ford Focus, and Vauxhall Corsa.

In 2019, Honda announced that its Swindon plant will close by 2021.

In June 2019, Ford announced that it would close its Ford Bridgend Engine Plant by September 2020 due to a lack of demand for the &quot;Dragon&quot; engine produced there. The plant was closed on 25 September 2020.

===From 2020===

In March 2021, Aston Martin announced that their electric sports models would be manufactured at their car plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

<text>Sylvester Graham (July 5, 1794 – September 11, 1851) was an American Presbyterian minister and dietary reformer known for his emphasis on vegetarianism, the temperance movement, and eating whole-grain bread. His preaching
inspired the graham flour, graham bread, and graham cracker products. Graham is often referred to as the &quot;Father of Vegetarianism&quot; in the United States of America.

==Early life==

Graham was born in 1794 in Suffield, Connecticut, to a family with 17 children. His father was 72 years old when Graham was born and his mother was mentally ill. His father died when Graham was two, and he spent his childhood moving from one relative&#x27;s home to another. One of his relatives ran a tavern where Graham was put to work. His experience with drunkenness there led him to hate alcohol his whole life and forswear drinking, which made him an exception among his peers at the time. 

He was often sick, and missed a great deal of schooling. He worked as a farmhand, cleaner, and teacher before deciding on the ministry as an antidote for his poor health. He entered Amherst Academy in his late 20s to become a minister, as his father and grandfather had been. He withdrew from school a year later, because his histrionic manner was scorned by his fellow students.

His social rejection was followed by a nervous breakdown. To recover, he moved to Little Compton, Rhode Island. There, he met and married Sara Earl, who had nursed him back to health. He studied theology privately, and in 1828 began working as an itinerant preacher at the Bound Brook Presbyterian Church in Bound Brook, New Jersey.

==Career==

In 1830, Graham accepted a position at the Philadelphia Temperance Society. He left six months later to focus on preaching health.

Graham&#x27;s appointment and conversion to vegetarianism came as the 1829–1837 cholera pandemic was breaking in Europe, and Americans were terrified that it would reach the United States. Accepted medical opinion was that the best way to prevent contracting cholera was to eat plenty of meat, drink port wine, and avoid vegetables. People also believed that cholera was a plague, a punishment from God.

The Philadelphia Temperance Society was led not by ministers, as most other temperance societies were, but by doctors who were primarily concerned with the health effects of consuming alcohol. Moving in that company, Graham may have met two of the other fathers of American vegetarianism: William Metcalfe, an English minister who established a vegetarian church in Philadelphia, and William A. Alcott, a Philadelphia doctor who wrote extensively about vegetarianism and wrote the first American vegetarian cookbook. Graham taught himself about physiology and apparently arrived at his own conclusion that meat was just as much an expression of and spur to gluttony as alcohol was, that they corrupted both the body and soul of individuals and harmed families and society. 

His belief was influenced by the book &quot;Treatise on Physiology&quot; by François-Joseph-Victor Broussais, published in Philadelphia in 1826, that claimed what people ate had enormous influence on their health. Graham&#x27;s interest was also captured by the books written by the German chemist Friedrich Accum, called &quot;Treatise on Adulteration of Foods and Culinary Poisons&quot;, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives in food and especially in bread, and &quot;Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread&quot;. Wheat flour at that time was often doctored with contaminants such as alum, chalk, and plaster of Paris to extend it, whiten it, or to hide odors from spoilage. Bread was made from very finely ground flour (which Graham viewed as &quot;tortured&quot;) and brewers yeast (used to make beer).

Like other members of the temperance movement, Graham viewed physical pleasure and especially sexual stimulation with suspicion, as things that excited lust leading to behavior that harmed individuals, families, and societies. Graham was strongly influenced by the Bible and Christian theology in his own idiosyncratic way. He believed that people should eat only plants, like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and believed that plague and illness were caused by living in ways that ignored natural law. He urged people to remain calm, and not allow worry or lust to shake them from living rightly – perhaps one of the first people to claim that stress causes disease.

From these views, Graham created a theology and diet aimed at keeping individuals, families, and society pure and healthy – drinking pure water and eating a vegetarian diet anchored by bread made at home from flour coarsely ground at home so that it remained wholesome and natural, containing no added spices or other &quot;stimulants&quot;, and a rigorous lifestyle that included sleeping on hard beds and avoiding warm baths. The regimen has been described as an early example of preventive medicine. The emphasis on milling and baking at home was part of his vision of America in which women remained at home and nursed their families into health and maintained them there, as his wife had done for him. 

Graham believed that adhering to such diet would prevent people from having impure thoughts and in turn would stop masturbation, thought by Graham to be a catalyst for blindness and early death. His piece &quot;On Self-Pollution&quot;, published in 1834, contributed to the masturbation scare in antebellum America. He believed youthful masturbation was dangerous to children&#x27;s health because of the immaturity of their reproductive organs.

As a skilled and fiery preacher, his peculiar message, combining patriotism, theology, diet, lifestyle, and messages already prevalent from the temperance movement, captured the attention of the frightened public and outraged bakers and butchers, as well as the medical establishment. When the cholera epidemic reached New York in 1832, people who had followed his advice appeared to thrive, and his fame exploded. He published his first book in 1837, &quot;Treatise on Bread and Bread-Making&quot;, which included a history of bread and described how to make Graham bread. It was reprinted in 2012 by Andrews McMeel Publishing, as a selection of its American Antiquarian Cookbook Collection. His lectures in New York and Boston that year were thronged; the Boston lecture was disrupted by a threat of riots by butchers and commercial bakers.

===Grahamism===

As his fame spread, &quot;Grahamism&quot; became a movement, and people inspired by his preaching began to develop and market Graham flour, Graham bread, and graham crackers. He neither invented nor endorsed any specific product, nor did he receive any money from their sale. Graham influenced other Americans, including Horace Greeley and John Harvey Kellogg, founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.

Grahamite boarding-houses were established in the 1830s. The Grahamites applied dietetic and hygienic principles to everyday life, including cold baths, hard mattresses, open windows, a vegetarian diet with Graham bread and drinking cold water. Animal flesh was banned from Grahamite homes, but eggs were allowed to be eaten at breakfast and were an important component of Grahamite diets.

===American Physiological Society===

In 1837, Colonel John Benson, Graham, and William Alcott founded the American Physiological Society (APS) in Boston to promote Grahamism. Alcott was first President of the Society. After a year, the Society was reported to have had 251 members, including 93 women. It lasted just three years.

Laura J. Miller commented that the Society was &quot;the most visible association promoting natural foods principles until the American Vegetarian Society was founded in 1850&quot;. Many of the APS members suffered from chronic disease and became vegetarian. It has been described as &quot;likely the first exclusively vegetarian organization in the United States&quot;. It was also the first American natural hygiene organization. A notable member of the APS was Mary Gove Nichols, who gave health lectures to women.

In 1837, Graham and David Cambell founded &quot;The Graham Journal of Health and Longevity&quot;. It was &quot;designed to illustrate by facts, and sustain by reason and principles the science of human life as taught by Sylvester Graham&quot;. It was edited by Campbell, Secretary of the APR (1837–1839), and five volumes were published. In 1840, the journal merged with the &quot;Library of Health&quot;, edited by Alcott.

===American Vegetarian Society===

In 1850, Alcott, William Metcalfe, Russell Trall, and Graham founded the American Vegetarian Society in New York City, modeled on a similar organization established in Great Britain in 1847.

==Death==
Graham died of complications after receiving opium enemas, as directed by his doctor, at the age of 57 at home in Northampton, Massachusetts. His early death was the source of criticism and speculation. Historian Stephen Nissenbaum has written that Graham died &quot;after violating his own strictures by taking liquor and meat in a last desperate attempt to recover his health&quot;.

Russell Trall, who had visited Graham, noted that he had strayed from a strict vegetarian diet and was prescribed meat by his doctor to increase his blood circulation. Trall wrote that before his death Graham regretted this decision and &quot;fully and verily believed in the theory of vegetable diet as explained in his works&quot;.

After his death, vegetarians distanced themselves from Grahamism. However, his vegetarian message was disseminated far into the 20th century.

Food historians cite Graham as one of the earliest food faddists in America.

<doc id="250312" wikidata="Q12010087" url="?curid=250312" title="MG Rover Group">
<text>MG Rover Group was a British carmaker that existed between 2000 and 2005. It was the last domestically owned mass-production car manufacturer in the British motor industry. The company was formed when BMW sold the car-making and engine manufacturing assets of the original Rover Group to Phoenix Venture Holdings in 2000.

MG Rover went into administration in 2005 and its key assets were purchased by Nanjing Automobile Group, with Nanjing restarting MG sports car and sports saloon production in 2007. During that year Nanjing merged with SAIC Motor (the largest vehicle manufacturer in China). During 2009 the UK subsidiary was renamed MG Motor UK. The MG TF was manufactured at the former MG Rover Longbridge plant and sold within the UK from 2008 to 2010. In 2011 the first all new MG for 16 years (the MG 6) was launched in the UK (assembled at the Longbridge factory). During 2013 a supermini was added to the line up (the MG 3), this went on to help MG Motor become the fastest growing car manufacturer within the UK in 2014.

The Rover brand, which had been retained by BMW and licensed to MG Rover, was sold to Ford, which had bought Land Rover from BMW in 2000. The rights to the dormant Rover brand were sold by Ford, along with the Jaguar Cars and Land Rover businesses, to Tata Motors in 2008.

MG Rover Group was formally dissolved on 28 May 2023, more than 18 years after it was originally put into administration in April 2005.

==History==
MG Rover was formed from the parts of the former Rover Group volume car production business which BMW sold off in 2000 due to constant losses and a declining market share. BMW had acquired the Rover Group from British Aerospace in 1994 and had since sold the Land Rover business to Ford, and split off the MINI business as a new BMW subsidiary based in Cowley. MG Rover took control of the volume component of the former Rover Group (itself the remaining rump of British Leyland, which in turn had its roots in the even older British Motor Corporation, formerly Austin and Morris), which by now consisted solely of the Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Of the Rover Group&#x27;s other two major plants; Solihull had already been divested as part of the sale of Land Rover to Ford, whilst the Cowley and Swindon plants were retained by BMW for the production of the new MINI family of vehicles. As part of these changes, all remaining Rover volume production at Cowley (essentially now just the Rover 75 as the Rover 600/800 ranges had already been discontinued by this point), was moved to Longbridge, whilst MG Rover would be allowed to continue manufacturing the original Mini at Longbridge until the new MINI was launched by BMW a year later.

===Phoenix Consortium ownership===
When BMW sold off its interests, MG Rover was bought for a nominal £10 in May 2000 by a specially assembled group of businessmen known as the Phoenix Consortium. The consortium was headed by ex-Rover Chief Executive John Towers.

When Phoenix took over, their first loss for the last eight months of 2000 were reported to be around £400m. By 2004, the company had reduced the losses to around £80m but never made a profit.
MG Rover&#x27;s best year for car sales was their first full year of business, in 2001 – when they sold over 170,000 cars. In 2004 their sales had declined to around 120,000.

The company ceased trading on 8 April 2005, with debts of over £1.4 billion, after a proposed alliance with SAIC collapsed.

In relation to this, accounting firm Deloitte was fined £14 million (US$22 million) in September 2013 for failing to manage conflicts of interest. Deloitte had acted as corporate finance advisers to firms involved with MG Rover and the Phoenix Consortium, including tax advice while Deloitte audited MG Rover. An independent tribunal refused to grant the right to appeal a finding that Deloitte failed to consider public interest, as of November 2013.

===Aborted deal with SAIC of China===
In June 2004, it was learned that Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation had signed a joint venture partnership to develop new models and technologies with MG Rover. This led to much speculation among the British media suggesting the Chinese company was poised to launch a takeover. Later that year, in November, news broke of an agreement between the two companies to create a joint venture company to produce up to a million cars a year, with the production shared between MG Rover&#x27;s Longbridge site and locations in China. SAIC were to have a 70% stake in this company in return for a £1 billion investment, with MG Rover owning the remaining 30%. However, this agreement had to be ratified by the Chinese government, specifically its National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The Commission held the opinion that if BMW could not make a success of Rover, then it would be hard for SAIC to do so.

On 8 December 2004, Tata of India, which had cooperated over the export of the Tata Indica as the CityRover, threatened to cease its agreement with MG Rover if the SAIC tie-up went ahead, according to the Indian press. Tata claimed the report was inaccurate two days later.

In January 2005, it was revealed that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had intervened to support the alliance between MG Rover and SAIC. MG Rover could not give a date on which the agreement would be finalized.

In April 2005, it was reported that the partnership deal with SAIC was in trouble because the British Government had decided to withdraw its offer of a £120 million loan to keep the deal going. On 7 April 2005 the company announced that it was suspending production because of component shortages. Later in the day, it was announced by Patricia Hewitt, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, that the company was being placed in receivership. Her statement was based on a conversation with MG Rover chairman, John Towers. It was later denied by MG Rover Group, although the company admitted that it had engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountancy firm, to advise on its current financial situation. In the event, MG Rover placed itself in administration on 8 April 2005, a different status from receivership under British law.

On 8 April 2005, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Richard Burden, Labour M.P. for Birmingham Northfield visited Tony Woodley at the offices of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union in Birmingham and stated that there might be some hope for the future of the company, although not the original deal agreed with SAIC. In the media, any news about MG Rover was overshadowed by the Pope&#x27;s funeral and the problems of the register office marriage of the Prince of Wales and his bride.

On 10 April 2005, MG Rover announced that they had received a £6.5M loan from the British Government. This would cover workers&#x27; wages for one week while buy-out proposals were made to SAIC. The same week, SAIC denied it had ever made an offer to buy MG Rover and threatened to sue anyone who attempted to make the 25 and 75 models. SAIC purchased the technical rights to manufacture Rover&#x27;s 25 and 75 models, and for the Powertrain Ltd business, for £67M. It did not acquire the Rover name, which was still owned by BMW at the time (See &#x27;Brands&#x27; below).

===Financial ruin===
On 15 April 2005, it was announced that SAIC had once again rejected pleas to buy out the company. With no other rescue deal in the pipeline, the administrators were not in a position to seek further funding from the government and announced that redundancy notices to Longbridge staff (who numbered more than 6,000) would be issued.

As well as the job losses at Longbridge, the months which followed the collapse of MG Rover resulted in many job losses in the supply chain, as well as jobs in MG Rover dealerships, as these businesses either went bankrupt, were faced with having to make job cuts, or in the case of some dealerships switched to different brands.

By the end of April 2005, Sir Richard Branson had reportedly expressed an interest in buying the remaining assets of the company for the purpose of reviving the marque in order to enter the hybrid automobile market, and several other parties were also rumoured as wishing to buy the remnants. These included two Russian businessmen, although one of them denied any interest in buying the company&#x27;s assets. The Iranian state-owned car manufacturer, SAIPA who had worked with MG Rover installing the K series engine in a car for the Iranian market that was based on the old Mazda 121 and Kia Pride, were also rumoured to be potential buyers.

SAIC had claimed that it had already acquired intellectual property rights in some Rover products for £67 million in the autumn of 2004, including the Rover 25, the Rover 75 and the Rover Powertrain K-series engine, but the Administrators advised that there was still interest in saving some other parts of the company, including MG, and 13 May 2005 was set as the deadline for bids from potential investors.

On 20 May 2005, the Administrators announced that, after considering numerous proposals, they had entered talks with two unnamed &quot;overseas companies&quot; with a view to restarting one or more of the Longbridge production lines. Nevertheless, the following week they informed creditors that they by then expected the company to proceed instead to a creditors&#x27; voluntary liquidation, setting the date for a preliminary Creditors&#x27; Meeting to be held in Birmingham on 10 June 2005. At that meeting, creditors learned that so little of value was left in the company that there would probably be negligible or even no repayment of its outstanding debt and that, although three bidders were then still negotiating to acquire the company intact as a going concern, the Administrators had instructed their agents to prepare for the piecemeal sale of the very few remaining assets in the event that satisfactory negotiations for the sale of the entire business were not concluded.

On 14 July 2005, it was reported that Magma Holdings, a financial group including former Ford Motor Company and General Motors executives, working in conjunction with SAIC, would be making an offer for the assets of both MG Rover and engine maker Rover Powertrain which, if successful, would see at least some production being restarted at Longbridge, and that talks with the other two interested parties – China&#x27;s Nanjing Automobile Group and Project Kimber (a consortium of Birmingham businessmen led by David James) – were still in progress.

More than 6,000 workers at MG Rover lost their jobs when the company went into liquidation. As many as 25,000 jobs were reported to have been lost in related supply industries, meaning that the total number of job losses brought on by MG Rover&#x27;s collapse was somewhere in the region of 30,000.

===Nanjing===
On 18 July, Magma Holdings and SAIC formalized their bid with a reported offer of £60M, with a number of additional conditions. However, that offer was not well received, and on 22 July, the Administrators announced that the principal remaining assets of the group had been sold to the Nanjing Automobile Group for around £53M, with a deposit of around $5M. Nanjing Automobile Group indicating that their preliminary plans involved relocating the Powertrain engine plant to China and splitting car production into Rover lines in China and MG lines in the West Midlands (though not necessarily at Longbridge), where a UK R&amp;D and technical facility would also be developed. But on 27 August, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the balance of around £47M, due on 22 August had not been paid. Citing confidentiality, the Administrators declined to comment.

Because the Rover 45 range produced at Longbridge had still had significant Honda content, originating from the companies&#x27; legacy partnership with Rover and British Leyland, Honda executives moved quickly to terminate the licensing agreement and removed tooling and assembly equipment for the car from Longbridge.

Nanjing Automobile started shipping equipment from Longbridge to China on 15 September and, according to a report in &quot;The Times&quot; on Saturday, 17 September, were close to a deal with SAIC under which they would manufacture the Rover 25 and Powertrain engines while SAIC would produce a stretched Rover 75. Nanjing Automobile Group was reported to be in exclusive negotiations with GB Sports Cars, a venture by former Rover managers, to re-establish MG production at Longbridge.

In late October, key ex-workers received letters from Nanjing Automobile Corp offering 10 months&#x27; work dismantling plant at Longbridge for reassembly in China while talks with GB Sports Cars continued. However, after announcing that the UK government had not offered any substantial assistance in either grants or loans, Nanjing Automobile was also reported to have begun negotiations with at least two other potential partners, including &quot;a wealthy San Francisco family&quot;, and, in early November, Nanjing committed to making every effort &quot;to resume production [at Longbridge] at the beginning of 2007&quot;.
In August 2008, more than three years after the facility had closed due to MG Rover&#x27;s bankruptcy, assembly at Longbridge of a lightly revised MG TF roadster for the European market, from Chinese-built semi-knocked-down (SKD) kits, restarted.

SAIC Motor merged with Nanjing Automobile in 2007, whilst nearly three-quarters of the massive Longbridge factory had been demolished and its land sold off - the old South Works is the only part of the plant which has survived. By 2011 MG Motor UK as it is now known started production of the first all new MG in 16 years, the MG6. In 2013 a new super-mini was added to the line up, the MG3. This was launched in summer 2013 and during 2014 helped in making MG Motor the fastest growing vehicle manufacturer within the UK. During the spring of 2015 a new MG6 was launched and plans for a new SUV were unveiled for the following year.

==Official reports==
The UK Government commissioned reports into the collapse of the company. The National Audit Office reported in March 2006 on the financial support provided to the company. It commended the DTI&#x27;s contingency planning in 2004, but questioned whether the loan made in April 2005 achieved value for money.

The DTI commissioned accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to report on the collapse of the company; this took four years to complete at a cost of £14.8 million. The firm issued its report to business minister Peter Mandelson in July 2009, and it was published on 11 September 2009. The report revealed that five executives took £42m in pay and pensions from the troubled firm as it collapsed. This was possible as Techtronic, the company that held the 427 million pound loan from BMW and was owned by the Phoenix Four, charged MG Rover interest and therefore made a profit. The report focused its criticism on the Phoenix Four and chief executive Kevin Howe who oversaw its collapse.

Other findings included evidence of a personal relationship between Nick Stephenson and a consultant who he paid more than £1.6m in the 15-month period up to April 2005. Meanwhile, &quot;Evidence Eliminator&quot; software installed by Mr Beale deleted documents which were likely to have been relevant to the investigation. The investigators further accused Mr Beale of giving &quot;untruthful&quot; evidence during interviews.

Conservative business spokesman Kenneth Clarke said it was right the report criticised the Phoenix Four, whose behaviour was &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Lord Mandelson said the Phoenix group had not shown an &quot;ounce of humility&quot; about the firm&#x27;s demise and they owed an apology to the firm&#x27;s employees and creditors.

The Serious Fraud Office declined to mount an investigation into the matter, but Mandelson instructed lawyers to prepare a case to disqualify the key figures at Phoenix from future company directorships. In May 2011, the Phoenix Four were disqualified as acting as company directors for varying lengths of time, totalling 19 years.

==Sales==

The MG Rover range initially consisted of five cars: the Mini, Rover 25, Rover 45, Rover 75 and MG F along with car-derived van derivatives of the 25. The Mini was only built under temporary licence during the first five months of MG Rover&#x27;s existence, and since the 1980s had only been built in limited numbers. After production finished, previous owner BMW regained the rights to use the brand, and did so on an all-new car that was launched in 2001: MINI.

The Rover 25 and Rover 45 were recently facelifted versions of visibly ageing mid-1990s designs, but production figures had been slightly decreased due to a fall in demand, even though the Rover 25 had been Britain&#x27;s best-selling car of the month in April 2000. Both cars still had significant Honda content within their design (for example, the 25 still used underpinnings based on the 1989 Honda Concerto and the related Series II Rover 200, whilst the 45 was essentially a rebadged Honda Civic/Domani outfitted with a K-series engine) - a legacy from Rover&#x27;s one time partnership with Honda, which necessitated paying the Japanese company significant royalties on every car sold which further dented the profitability of those models.

The acclaimed Rover 75 was little over a year old, and after a slow start sales were rising. An estate version was launched following the shift of production from Cowley to Longbridge. The replacement for the MG F, the MG TF sports car was, inevitably, a relatively low-volume product, but it had consistently been the most popular car in its sector since its 1995 launch.

The Rover 25 and Rover 45 endured disappointing sales throughout MG Rover&#x27;s existence, though their MG ZR and MG ZS sports variants proved popular from their launch in 2001. The Rover 75 and its MG ZT sports variant enjoyed more popularity.

The range further expanded in 2003 with the launch of the smallest model, the Indian-built CityRover, built as part of a venture with Tata, and a flagship model, the MG XPower SV, based on the Qvale Mangusta. Both cars, however, failed to achieve the sales figures that MG Rover had hoped for.

* 1923 MG was created by Cecil Kimber based on Morris components
* 1930 American Austin a brand name created by Austin for US market
* 1947 Princess was created by Vanden Plas as a luxury car name
* 1987 Sterling created as a separate brand in the US by the Rover Group

The Rover brand was used under licence from BMW, and was sold to Ford following the collapse of MG Rover; it was subsequently bought in 2008 by TATA.

The &quot;MG XPower&quot; brand was created by MG Rover for their motorsport subsidiary, MG Sport and Racing Ltd. in 2001. It was subsequently used for the MG XPower SV sportscar, a higher powered version of the Qvale Mangusta, in 2005. After the demise of MG Rover, assets of MG Sport and Racing relating to the XPower SV were acquired from PWC, the Administrators, by the newly formed MG Sports and Racing Europe Ltd. However this company&#x27;s use of the &quot;MG&quot; trademark resulted in a legal dispute with Nanjing Automobile (Group) Corporation, which had also acquired assets of the defunct MG Rover Group. This case was won by Nanjing in February 2010.

<text>Healthy city is a term used in public health and urban design to stress the impact of policy on human health. It is a municipality that continually improves on a physical and a social level until environmental and pathological conditions are reached establishing an acceptable morbidity rate for the population. Its modern form derives from a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative on Healthy Cities and Villages in 1986, but has a history dating back to the mid 19th century. The term was developed in conjunction with the European Union, but rapidly became international as a way of establishing healthy public policy at the local level through health promotion. It emphasises the multi-dimensionality of health as laid out in WHO&#x27;s constitution and, more recently, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. An alternative term is Healthy Communities, or &quot;Municipios saludables&quot; in parts of Latin America.

==Approaches==
Many jurisdictions which have healthy community programmes and cities can apply to become a WHO-designated &quot;Healthy City&quot;. WHO defines the Healthy City as:
&quot;one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable
people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential.&quot;

Measuring the indices required, establishing standards and determining the impact of each component on health is difficult. In some regions such as Europe, a health impact assessment is a required piece of public policy development.

There are many networks of healthy cities, including in Europe and internationally, such as the Alliance for Healthy Cities. A key feature is ensuring that the social determinants of health are taken into consideration in urban design and urban governance. For example, &quot;urbanization and health&quot; was the theme of the 2010 World Health Day. One tool in developing healthy cities is social entrepreneurship.

<text>In topology, a covering or covering projection is a map between topological spaces that, intuitively, locally acts like a projection of multiple copies of a space onto itself. In particular, coverings are special types of local homeomorphisms. If formula_1 is a covering, formula_2 is said to be a covering space or cover of formula_3, and formula_3 is said to be the base of the covering, or simply the base. By abuse of terminology, formula_5 and formula_6 may sometimes be called covering spaces as well. Since coverings are local homeomorphisms, a covering space is a special kind of étalé space.

Covering spaces first arose in the context of complex analysis (specifically, the technique of analytic continuation), where they were introduced by Riemann as domains on which naturally multivalued complex functions become single-valued. These spaces are now called Riemann surfaces.

Covering spaces are an important tool in several areas of mathematics. In modern geometry, covering spaces (or branched coverings, which have slightly weaker conditions) are used in the construction of manifolds, orbifolds, and the morphisms between them. In algebraic topology, covering spaces are closely related to the fundamental group: for one, since all coverings have the homotopy lifting property, covering spaces are an important tool in the calculation of homotopy groups. A standard example in this vein is the calculation of the fundamental group of the circle by means of the covering of formula_7 by formula_8 (see below). Under certain conditions, covering spaces also exhibit a Galois correspondence with the subgroups of the fundamental group. 

== Definition ==

Let formula_3 be a topological space. A covering of formula_3 is a continuous map
: formula_11
such that for every formula_12 there exists an open neighborhood formula_13 of formula_14 and a discrete space formula_15 such that formula_16 and formula_17 is a homeomorphism for every formula_18.
The open sets formula_19 are called sheets, which are uniquely determined up to homeomorphism if formula_13 is connected. For each formula_12 the discrete set formula_22 is called the fiber of formula_14. If formula_3 is connected (and formula_5 is non-empty), it can be shown that formula_26 is surjective, and the cardinality of formula_15 is the same for all formula_12; this value is called the degree of the covering. If formula_5 is path-connected, then the covering formula_30 is called a path-connected covering. This definition is equivalent to the statement that formula_26 is a locally trivial Fiber bundle.

Some authors also require that formula_26 be surjective in the case that formula_3 is not connected.

== Examples ==
* For every topological space formula_3, the identity map formula_35 is a covering. Likewise for any discrete space formula_36 the projection formula_37 taking formula_38 is a covering. Coverings of this type are called trivial coverings; if formula_36 has finitely many (say formula_40) elements, the covering is called the trivial &quot;formula_40-sheeted&quot; covering of formula_3. 

* The map formula_43 with formula_44 is a covering of the unit circle formula_7. The base of the covering is formula_7 and the covering space is formula_8. For any point formula_48 such that formula_49, the set formula_50 is an open neighborhood of formula_14. The preimage of formula_52 under formula_53 is 
*: formula_54 
: and the sheets of the covering are formula_55 for formula_56 The fiber of formula_14 is
:: formula_58 
* Another covering of the unit circle is the map formula_59 with formula_60 for some formula_61 For an open neighborhood formula_52 of an formula_63, one has: 
:: formula_64.
* A map which is a local homeomorphism but not a covering of the unit circle is formula_65 with formula_66. There is a sheet of an open neighborhood of formula_67, which is not mapped homeomorphically onto formula_52.

== Properties ==
=== Local homeomorphism ===
Since a covering formula_69 maps each of the disjoint open sets of formula_70 homeomorphically onto formula_52 it is a local homeomorphism, i.e. formula_26 is a continuous map and for every formula_73 there exists an open neighborhood formula_74 of formula_75, such that formula_76 is a homeomorphism.

It follows that the covering space formula_77 and the base space formula_3 locally share the same properties.

* If formula_3 is a connected and non-orientable manifold, then there is a covering formula_80 of degree formula_81, whereby formula_5 is a connected and orientable manifold.
* If formula_3 is a connected Lie group, then there is a covering formula_80 which is also a Lie group homomorphism and formula_85 is a Lie group.
* If formula_3 is a graph, then it follows for a covering formula_69 that formula_77 is also a graph.
* If formula_3 is a connected manifold, then there is a covering formula_80, whereby formula_5 is a connected and simply connected manifold.
* If formula_3 is a connected Riemann surface, then there is a covering formula_80 which is also a holomorphic map and formula_5 is a connected and simply connected Riemann surface.

=== Factorisation ===
Let formula_95 and formula_77 be path-connected, locally path-connected spaces, and formula_97 and formula_53 be continuous maps, such that the diagram 

commutes.

* If formula_6 and formula_100 are coverings, so is formula_53.
* If formula_6 and formula_53 are coverings, so is formula_100.

=== Product of coverings ===
Let formula_3 and formula_106 be topological spaces and formula_107 and formula_108 be coverings, then formula_109 with formula_110 is a covering. However, coverings of formula_111 are not all of this form in general.

=== Equivalence of coverings ===
Let formula_3 be a topological space and formula_107 and formula_114 be coverings. Both coverings are called equivalent, if there exists a homeomorphism formula_115, such that the diagram

commutes. If such a homeomorphism exists, then one calls the covering spaces formula_77 and formula_117 isomorphic.

=== Lifting property ===
All coverings satisfy the lifting property, i.e.:

Let formula_118 be the unit interval and formula_107 be a covering. Let formula_120 be a continuous map and formula_121 be a lift of formula_122, i.e. a continuous map such that formula_123. Then there is a uniquely determined, continuous map formula_124 for which formula_125 and which is a lift of formula_126, i.e. formula_127.

If formula_3 is a path-connected space, then for formula_129 it follows that the map formula_130 is a lift of a path in formula_3 and for formula_132 it is a lift of a homotopy of paths in formula_3.

As a consequence, one can show that the fundamental group formula_134 of the unit circle is an infinite cyclic group, which is generated by the homotopy classes of the loop formula_135 with formula_136.

Let formula_3 be a path-connected space and formula_107 be a connected covering. Let formula_139 be any two points, which are connected by a path formula_140, i.e. formula_141 and formula_142. Let formula_143 be the unique lift of formula_140, then the map 
: formula_145 with formula_146

is bijective.

If formula_3 is a path-connected space and formula_148 a connected covering, then the induced group homomorphism 
: formula_149 with formula_150,
is injective and the subgroup formula_151 of formula_152 consists of the homotopy classes of loops in formula_3, whose lifts are loops in formula_77.

== Branched covering ==
=== Definitions ===
==== Holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces ====
Let formula_3 and formula_156 be Riemann surfaces, i.e. one dimensional complex manifolds, and let formula_157 be a continuous map. formula_158 is holomorphic in a point formula_12, if for any charts formula_160 of formula_14 and formula_162 of formula_163, with formula_164, the map formula_165 is holomorphic.

If formula_158 is holomorphic at all formula_12, we say formula_158 is holomorphic.

The map formula_169 is called the local expression of formula_158 in formula_12.

If formula_157 is a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces, then formula_158 is surjective and an open map, i.e. for every open set formula_174 the image formula_175 is also open.

==== Ramification point and branch point ====
Let formula_157 be a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces. For every formula_12 there exist charts for formula_14 and formula_163 and there exists a uniquely determined formula_180, such that the local expression formula_126 of formula_158 in formula_14 is of the form formula_184. The number formula_185 is called the ramification index of formula_158 in formula_14 and the point formula_12 is called a ramification point if formula_189. If formula_190 for an formula_12, then formula_14 is unramified. The image point formula_193 of a ramification point is called a branch point.

==== Degree of a holomorphic map ====
Let formula_157 be a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces. The degree formula_195 of formula_158 is the cardinality of the fiber of an unramified point formula_193, i.e. formula_198.

This number is well-defined, since for every formula_199 the fiber formula_200 is discrete and for any two unramified points formula_201, it is: formula_202

It can be calculated by: 
: formula_203 

=== Branched covering ===
==== Definition ====
A continuous map formula_157 is called a branched covering, if there exists a closed set with dense complement formula_205, such that formula_206 is a covering.

==== Examples ====
* Let formula_207 and formula_208, then formula_209 with formula_210 is a branched covering of degree formula_211, where by formula_212 is a branch point.
* Every non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces formula_157 of degree formula_214 is a branched covering of degree formula_214.

== Universal covering ==

=== Definition ===
Let formula_216 be a simply connected covering. If formula_217 is another simply connected covering, then there exists a uniquely determined homeomorphism formula_218, such that the diagram

commutes.

This means that formula_6 is, up to equivalence, uniquely determined and because of that universal property denoted as the universal covering of the space formula_3.

=== Existence ===
A universal covering does not always exist. The following theorem guarantees its existence for a certain class of base spaces.

Let formula_3 be a connected, locally simply connected topological space. Then, there exists a universal covering formula_222

The set formula_5 is defined as formula_224 where formula_225 is any chosen base point. The map formula_226 is defined by formula_227

The topology on formula_5 is constructed as follows: Let formula_229 be a path with formula_230 Let formula_52 be a simply connected neighborhood of the endpoint formula_232 Then, for every formula_233 there is a path formula_234 inside formula_52 from formula_14 to formula_237 that is unique up to homotopy. Now consider the set formula_238 The restriction formula_239 with formula_240 is a bijection and formula_241 can be equipped with the final topology of formula_242

The fundamental group formula_243 acts freely on formula_5 by formula_245 and the orbit space formula_246 is homeomorphic to formula_3 through the map formula_248

=== Examples ===
* formula_43 with formula_44 is the universal covering of the unit circle formula_7.
* formula_252 with formula_253 is the universal covering of the projective space formula_254 for formula_255.
* formula_256 with formula_257 is the universal covering of the unitary group formula_258.
* Since formula_259, it follows that the quotient map formula_260 is the universal covering of formula_261.
* A topological space which has no universal covering is the Hawaiian earring: formula_262 One can show that no neighborhood of the origin formula_263 is simply connected.

== G-coverings ==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a discrete group acting on the topological space &quot;X&quot;. This means that each element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is associated to a homeomorphism H&quot;g&quot; of &quot;X&quot; onto itself, in such a way that H&quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; is always equal to H&quot;g&quot; ∘ H&quot;h&quot; for any two elements &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. (Or in other words, a group action of the group &quot;G&quot; on the space &quot;X&quot; is just a group homomorphism of the group &quot;G&quot; into the group Homeo(&quot;X&quot;) of self-homeomorphisms of &quot;X&quot;.) It is natural to ask under what conditions the projection from &quot;X&quot; to the orbit space &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is a covering map. This is not always true since the action may have fixed points. An example for this is the cyclic group of order 2 acting on a product by the twist action where the non-identity element acts by . Thus the study of the relation between the fundamental groups of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is not so straightforward.

However the group &quot;G&quot; does act on the fundamental groupoid of &quot;X&quot;, and so the study is best handled by considering groups acting on groupoids, and the corresponding &quot;orbit groupoids&quot;. The theory for this is set down in Chapter 11 of the book &quot;Topology and groupoids&quot; referred to below. The main result is that for discontinuous actions of a group &quot;G&quot; on a Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot; which admits a universal cover, then the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of &quot;X&quot;, i.e. the quotient of that groupoid by the action of the group &quot;G&quot;. This leads to explicit computations, for example of the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space.

== Smooth coverings ==
Let and be smooth manifolds with or without boundary. A covering formula_264 is called a smooth covering if it is a smooth map and the sheets are mapped &quot;diffeomorphically&quot; onto the corresponding open subset of . (This is in contrast to the definition of a covering, which merely requires that the sheets are mapped &quot;homeomorphically&quot; onto the corresponding open subset.)

== Deck transformation ==
=== Definition ===
Let formula_107 be a covering. A deck transformation is a homeomorphism formula_266, such that the diagram of continuous maps

commutes. Together with the composition of maps, the set of deck transformation forms a group formula_267, which is the same as formula_268.

Now suppose formula_269 is a covering map and formula_270 (and therefore also formula_3) is connected and locally path connected. The action of formula_268 on each fiber is free. If this action is transitive on some fiber, then it is transitive on all fibers, and we call the cover regular (or normal or Galois). Every such regular cover is a principal, where formula_273 is considered as a discrete topological group.

Every universal cover formula_274 is regular, with deck transformation group being isomorphic to the fundamental group 

=== Examples ===
* Let formula_59 be the covering formula_60 for some formula_277, then the map formula_278 for formula_279 is a deck transformation and formula_280.
* Let formula_43 be the covering formula_44, then the map formula_283 for formula_279 is a deck transformation and formula_285.
* As another important example, consider formula_286 the complex plane and formula_287 the complex plane minus the origin. Then the map formula_288 with formula_289 is a regular cover. The deck transformations are multiplications with formula_211-th roots of unity and the deck transformation group is therefore isomorphic to the cyclic group formula_291. Likewise, the map formula_292 with formula_293 is the universal cover.

=== Properties ===
Let formula_3 be a path-connected space and formula_107 be a connected covering. Since a deck transformation formula_266 is bijective, it permutes the elements of a fiber formula_297 with formula_12 and is uniquely determined by where it sends a single point. In particular, only the identity map fixes a point in the fiber. Because of this property every deck transformation defines a group action on formula_77, i.e. let formula_174 be an open neighborhood of a formula_12 and formula_302 an open neighborhood of an formula_303, then formula_304 is a group action.

=== Normal coverings ===
==== Definition ====
A covering formula_107 is called normal, if formula_306. This means, that for every formula_12 and any two formula_308 there exists a deck transformation formula_266, such that formula_310.

==== Properties ====
Let formula_3 be a path-connected space and formula_107 be a connected covering. Let formula_313 be a subgroup of formula_152, then formula_6 is a normal covering iff formula_316 is a normal subgroup of formula_152.

If formula_107 is a normal covering and formula_313, then formula_320.

If formula_107 is a path-connected covering and formula_313, then formula_323, whereby formula_324 is the normaliser of formula_316.

Let formula_77 be a topological space. A group formula_327 acts &quot;discontinuously&quot; on formula_77, if every formula_73 has an open neighborhood formula_74 with formula_331, such that for every formula_332 with formula_333 one has formula_334.

If a group formula_327 acts discontinuously on a topological space formula_77, then the quotient map formula_337 with formula_338 is a normal covering. Hereby formula_339 is the quotient space and formula_340 is the orbit of the group action.

==== Examples ====
* The covering formula_341 with formula_60 is a normal coverings for every formula_207.
* Every simply connected covering is a normal covering.

=== Calculation ===
Let formula_327 be a group, which acts discontinuously on a topological space formula_77 and let formula_337 be the normal covering. 

* If formula_77 is path-connected, then formula_348.

* If formula_77 is simply connected, then formula_350.

==== Examples ====
* Let formula_207. The antipodal map formula_352 with formula_353 generates, together with the composition of maps, a group formula_354 and induces a group action formula_355, which acts discontinuously on formula_356. Because of formula_357 it follows, that the quotient map formula_358 is a normal covering and for formula_359 a universal covering, hence formula_360 for formula_359.
* Let formula_261 be the special orthogonal group, then the map formula_363 is a normal covering and because of formula_259, it is the universal covering, hence formula_365.
* With the group action formula_366 of formula_367 on formula_368, whereby formula_369 is the semidirect product formula_370, one gets the universal covering formula_371 of the klein bottle formula_372, hence formula_373.
* Let formula_374 be the torus which is embedded in the formula_375. Then one gets a homeomorphism formula_376, which induces a discontinuous group action formula_377, whereby formula_378. It follows, that the map formula_379 is a normal covering of the klein bottle, hence formula_380.
* Let formula_381 be embedded in the formula_375. Since the group action formula_383 is discontinuously, whereby formula_384 are coprime, the map formula_385 is the universal covering of the lens space formula_386, hence formula_387.

== Galois correspondence ==
Let formula_3 be a connected and locally simply connected space, then for every subgroup formula_389 there exists a path-connected covering formula_390 with formula_391.

Let formula_392 and formula_393 be two path-connected coverings, then they are equivalent iff the subgroups formula_394 and formula_395 are conjugate to each other.

Let formula_3 be a connected and locally simply connected space, then, up to equivalence between coverings, there is a bijection:

formula_397

For a sequence of subgroups formula_398 one gets a sequence of coverings formula_399. For a subgroup formula_400 with index formula_401, the covering formula_402 has degree formula_214.

== Classification ==
=== Definitions ===
==== Category of coverings ====
Let formula_3 be a topological space. The objects of the category formula_405 are the coverings formula_107 of formula_3 and the morphisms between two coverings formula_107 and formula_409 are continuous maps formula_410, such that the diagram 

commutes.

==== G-Set ====
Let formula_411 be a topological group. The category formula_412 is the category of sets which are G-sets. The morphisms are G-maps formula_413 between G-sets. They satisfy the condition formula_414 for every formula_415.

=== Equivalence ===
Let formula_3 be a connected and locally simply connected space, formula_12 and formula_418 be the fundamental group of formula_3. Since formula_411 defines, by lifting of paths and evaluating at the endpoint of the lift, a group action on the fiber of a covering, the functor formula_421 is an equivalence of categories.

== Applications ==
An important practical application of covering spaces occurs in charts on SO(3), the rotation group. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in navigation, nautical engineering, and aerospace engineering, among many other uses. Topologically, SO(3) is the real projective space RP3, with fundamental group Z/2, and only (non-trivial) covering space the hypersphere &quot;S&quot;3, which is the group Spin(3), and represented by the unit quaternions. Thus quaternions are a preferred method for representing spatial rotations – see quaternions and spatial rotation.

However, it is often desirable to represent rotations by a set of three numbers, known as Euler angles (in numerous variants), both because this is conceptually simpler for someone familiar with planar rotation, and because one can build a combination of three gimbals to produce rotations in three dimensions. Topologically this corresponds to a map from the 3-torus &quot;T&quot;3 of three angles to the real projective space RP3 of rotations, and the resulting map has imperfections due to this map being unable to be a covering map. Specifically, the failure of the map to be a local homeomorphism at certain points is referred to as gimbal lock, and is demonstrated in the animation at the right – at some points (when the axes are coplanar) the rank of the map is 2, rather than 3, meaning that only 2 dimensions of rotations can be realized from that point by changing the angles. This causes problems in applications, and is formalized by the notion of a covering space.

<text>George Harry Bowering, (born December 1, 1935) is a prolific Canadian novelist, poet, historian, and biographer. He was the first Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

== Life and career ==
Bowering was born in Penticton, British Columbia, and raised in the nearby town of Oliver, where his father was a high-school chemistry teacher. 

Bowering lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, and is Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University, where he worked for 30 years. Never having written as an adherent of organized religion, he in the past wryly described himself as a Baptist agnostic. In 2002, Bowering was appointed the first ever Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate. That same year, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was awarded the Order of British Columbia in 2004.

When the Indian Hungryalist, also known as Hungry generation, poet Malay Roy Choudhury, was arrested at Kolkata, India, Bowering brought out a special issue of Imago for helping the Indian poet in his trial.

Bowering was one of the judges for the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize.

<doc id="250335" wikidata="Q1494468" url="?curid=250335" title="Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart">
<text>Robert Adam Ross &quot;Bob&quot; Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart, (26 June 1936 – 18 January 2020) was a British Liberal Democrat politician and life peer.

He was the last leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), serving during the negotiations that led to its merger with the Liberal Party in 1988. He then became joint interim leader of the new party, known as the Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD) and later as the Liberal Democrats. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1966 to 2001, when he was elevated to the House of Lords.

==Early life==
MacLennan was born in Glasgow in 1936. His father, Sir Hector MacLennan, was a renowned gynaecologist and obstetrician. His mother, Isabel Margaret (née Adam), was a physician and public health activist. He was the brother of actor and director David MacLennan, actress and writer Elizabeth MacLennan, and Kenneth MacLennan.

He was educated at Glasgow Academy; Balliol College, Oxford; Trinity College, Cambridge; and Columbia University, New York City. He was called to the bar in 1962 at Gray&#x27;s Inn and before entering parliament practised as an international lawyer based in London. From 1963 to 1964, he worked at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York.

==In Parliament==

He became Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Caithness and Sutherland in 1966, and serving until 1997; and for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross after boundary changes, from 1997 to 2001.

He was first elected as a member of the Labour Party, where he was described as a &quot;gentle Jenkinsite&quot; and served as a junior minister in the Labour government of 1974–1979. In 1981 defected to become a founder member of the SDP, co-founded by Jenkins. Maclennan helped write the party&#x27;s constitution. He was one of the few SDP MPs to keep their seats in the 1983 general election. Following his stint as SDP Leader in 1988, he served as a front bench spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, and as their president from 1994 until 1998.

He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1997.

After his retirement at the 2001 general election, he was raised to the House of Lords, created a life peer as Baron Maclennan of Rogart, &quot;of Rogart in Sutherland&quot;. He was the party&#x27;s Cabinet Office and Scotland spokesman in the House of Lords until 2015.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1968, Maclennan married Helen Noyes (née Cutter), daughter of Justice Richard Ammi Cutter of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. As Maclennan&#x27;s spouse she was Lady Maclennan of Rogart. She had one son from a previous marriage, and a son and a daughter with Maclennan.

Maclennan died at his home in the City of Westminster on 18 January 2020, at age 83.

<doc id="250336" wikidata="Q192869" url="?curid=250336" title="BMP file format">
<text>The BMP file format, or bitmap, is a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter), especially on Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems.

The BMP file format is capable of storing two-dimensional digital images in various color depths, and optionally with data compression, alpha channels, and color profiles. The Windows Metafile (WMF) specification covers the BMP file format.

== Device-independent bitmaps and the BMP file format ==

Microsoft has defined a particular representation of color bitmaps of different color depths, as an aid to exchanging bitmaps between devices and applications with a variety of internal representations. They called these device-independent bitmaps or DIBs, and the file format for them is called DIB file format or BMP image file format.

According to Microsoft support: A device-independent bitmap (DIB) is a format used to define device-independent bitmaps in various color resolutions. The main purpose of DIBs is to allow bitmaps to be moved from one device to another (hence, the device-independent part of the name). A DIB is an external format, in contrast to a device-dependent bitmap, which appears in the system as a bitmap object (created by an application...). A DIB is normally transported in metafiles (usually using the StretchDIBits() function), BMP files, and the Clipboard ( data format).

The following sections discuss the data stored in the BMP file or DIB in detail. This is the standard BMP file format. Some applications create bitmap image files which are not compliant with the Microsoft documentation. Also, not all fields are used; a value of 0 will be found in these unused fields.

== File structure ==
The bitmap image file consists of fixed-size structures (headers) as well as variable-sized structures appearing in a predetermined sequence. Many different versions of some of these structures can appear in the file, due to the long evolution of this file format.

Referring to the diagram 1, the bitmap file is composed of structures in the following order:
=== DIBs in memory ===
A bitmap image file loaded into memory becomes a DIB data structure – an important component of the Windows GDI API. The in-memory DIB data structure is almost the same as the BMP file format, but it does not contain the 14-byte bitmap file header and begins with the DIB header. For DIBs loaded in memory, the color table can also consist of 16-bit entries that constitute indexes to the currently realized palette (an additional level of indirection), instead of explicit RGB color definitions. In all cases, the pixel array must begin at a memory address that is a multiple of 4 bytes. In non-packed DIBs loaded in memory, the optional color profile data should be located immediately after the color table and before the gap1 and pixel array (unlike in diag. 1).

When the size of gap1 and gap2 is zero, the in-memory DIB data structure is customarily referred to as &quot;packed DIB&quot; and can be referred to by a single pointer pointing to the beginning of the DIB header. In all cases, the pixel array must begin at a memory address that is a multiple of 4 bytes. In some cases it may be necessary to adjust the number of entries in the color table in order to force the memory address of the pixel array to a multiple of 4 bytes. For &quot;packed DIBs&quot; loaded in memory, the optional color profile data should immediately follow the pixel array, as depicted in diag. 1 (with gap1=0 and gap2=0).&lt;br&gt; &quot;Packed DIBs&quot; are required by Windows clipboard API functions as well as by some Windows patterned brush and resource functions.
=== Bitmap file header ===
This block of bytes is at the start of the file and is used to identify the file. A typical application reads this block first to ensure that the file is actually a BMP file and that it is not damaged. The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character &quot;B&quot; then the character &quot;M&quot; in ASCII encoding. All of the integer values are stored in little-endian format (i.e. least-significant byte first).

==== DIB header (bitmap information header) ====
This block of bytes tells the application detailed information about the image, which will be used to display the image on the screen. The block also matches the header used internally by Windows and OS/2 and has several different variants. All of them contain a dword (32-bit) field, specifying their size, so that an application can easily determine which header is used in the image. The reason that there are different headers is that Microsoft extended the DIB format several times. The new extended headers can be used with some GDI functions instead of the older ones, providing more functionality. Since the GDI supports a function for loading bitmap files, typical Windows applications use that functionality. One consequence of this is that for such applications, the BMP formats that they support match the formats supported by the Windows version being run. See the table below for more information.

The Windows 2.x BITMAPCOREHEADER differs from the OS/2 1.x BITMAPCOREHEADER (shown in the table above) in the one detail that the image width and height fields are signed integers, not unsigned.

Versions after only add fields to the end of the header of the previous version. 
For example: adds fields to , and adds fields to .

An integrated alpha channel has been introduced with the undocumented and with the documented (since Windows 95) and is used within Windows XP logon and theme system as well as Microsoft Office (since v2000); it is supported by some image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop since version 7 and Adobe Flash since version MX 2004 (then known as Macromedia Flash). It is also supported by GIMP, Google Chrome, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.

For compatibility reasons, most applications use the older DIB headers for saving files. With OS/2 no longer supported after Windows 2000, for now the common Windows format is the header. See next table for its description. All values are stored as unsigned integers, unless explicitly noted.

The compression method (offset 30) can be:

An OS/2 2.x ( in IBM&#x27;s documentation) contains 24 additional bytes:

The halftoning algorithm (offset 60) can be:

=== Color table ===
The color table (palette) occurs in the BMP image file directly after the BMP file header, the DIB header, and after the optional three or four bitmasks if the header with BI_BITFIELDS (12 bytes) or BI_ALPHABITFIELDS (16 bytes) option is used. Therefore, its offset is the size of the plus the size of the DIB header (plus optional 12-16 bytes for the three or four bit masks).&lt;br&gt;
The number of entries in the palette is either 2&quot;n&quot; (where n is the number of bits per pixel) or a smaller number specified in the header (in the OS/2 header format, only the full-size palette is supported). In most cases, each entry in the color table occupies 4 bytes, in the order blue, green, red, 0x00 (see below for exceptions). This is indexed in the in the structure member biBitCount.

The color table is a block of bytes (a table) listing the colors used by the image. Each pixel in an indexed color image is described by a number of bits (1, 4, or 8) which is an index of a single color described by this table. The purpose of the color palette in indexed color bitmaps is to inform the application about the actual color that each of these index values corresponds to. The purpose of the color table in non-indexed (non-palettized) bitmaps is to list the colors used by the bitmap for the purposes of optimization on devices with limited color display capability and to facilitate future conversion to different pixel formats and palettization.

The colors in the color table are usually specified in the 4-byte per entry ARGB32 format. The color table used with the OS/2 uses the 3-byte per entry RGB24 format. For DIBs loaded in memory, the color table can optionally consist of 2-byte entries – these entries constitute indexes to the currently realized palette instead of explicit RGB color definitions.

Microsoft does not disallow the presence of a valid alpha channel bit mask in and for 1bpp, 4bpp and 8bpp indexed color images, which indicates that the color table entries can also specify an alpha component using the 8.8.8.[0-8].[0-8] format via the RGBQUAD.rgbReserved member. However, some versions of Microsoft&#x27;s documentation disallow this feature by stating that the RGBQUAD.rgbReserved member &quot;must be zero&quot;.

As mentioned above, the color table is normally not used when the pixels are in the 16-bit per pixel (16bpp) format (and higher); there are normally no color table entries in those bitmap image files. However, the Microsoft documentation (on the MSDN web site as of Nov. 16, 2010) specifies that for 16bpp (and higher), the color table can be present to store a list of colors intended for optimization on devices with limited color display capability, while it also specifies, that in such cases, no indexed palette entries are present in this Color Table. This may seem like a contradiction if no distinction is made between the mandatory palette entries and the optional color list.

=== Pixel storage ===
The bits representing the bitmap pixels are packed in rows (also known as strides or scan lines). The size of each row is rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes (a 32-bit DWORD) by padding.

For images with height above 1, multiple padded rows are stored consecutively, forming a Pixel Array.

The total number of bytes necessary to store one row of pixels can be calculated as:
formula_1
The total number of bytes necessary to store an array of pixels in an n bits per pixel (bpp) image, with 2n colors, can be calculated by accounting for the effect of rounding up the size of each row to a multiple of 4 bytes, as follows:

formula_2
==== Pixel array (bitmap data) ====
The pixel array is a block of 32-bit DWORDs, that describes the image pixel by pixel. Usually pixels are stored &quot;bottom-up&quot;, starting in the lower left corner, going from left to right, and then row by row from the bottom to the top of the image. Unless is used, uncompressed Windows bitmaps also can be stored from the top to bottom, when the Image Height value is negative.

In the original OS/2 DIB, the only four legal values of color depth were 1, 4, 8, and 24 bits per pixel (bpp). 
Contemporary DIB Headers allow pixel formats with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 bits per pixel (bpp). GDI+ also permits 64 bits per pixel.

Padding bytes (not necessarily 0) must be appended to the end of the rows in order to bring up the length of the rows to a multiple of four bytes. When the pixel array is loaded into memory, each row must begin at a memory address that is a multiple of 4. This address/offset restriction is mandatory only for Pixel Arrays loaded in memory. For file storage purposes, only the size of each row must be a multiple of 4 bytes while the file offset can be arbitrary. A 24-bit bitmap with Width=1, would have 3 bytes of data per row (blue, green, red) and 1 byte of padding, while Width=2 would have 6 bytes of data and 2 bytes of padding, Width=3 would have 9 bytes of data and 3 bytes of padding, and Width=4 would have 12 bytes of data and no padding.

==== Compression ====
* Indexed color images may be compressed with 4-bit or 8-bit RLE or Huffman 1D algorithm.
* OS/2 2 24bpp images may be compressed with the 24-bit RLE algorithm.
* The 16bpp and 32bpp images are always stored uncompressed.
* Note that images in all color depths can be stored without compression if so desired.

==== Pixel format ====

* The 1-bit per pixel (1bpp) format supports 2 distinct colors, (for example: black and white). The pixel values are stored in each bit, with the first (left-most) pixel in the most-significant bit of the first byte. Each bit is an index into a table of 2 colors. An unset bit will refer to the first color table entry, and a set bit will refer to the last (second) color table entry.
* The 2-bit per pixel (2bpp) format supports 4 distinct colors and stores 4 pixels per 1 byte, the left-most pixel being in the two most significant bits (Windows CE only:). Each pixel value is a 2-bit index into a table of up to 4 colors.
* The 4-bit per pixel (4bpp) format supports 16 distinct colors and stores 2 pixels per 1 byte, the left-most pixel being in the more significant nibble. Each pixel value is a 4-bit index into a table of up to 16 colors.
* The 8-bit per pixel (8bpp) format supports 256 distinct colors and stores 1 pixel per 1 byte. Each byte is an index into a table of up to 256 colors.
* The 16-bit per pixel (16bpp) format supports 65536 distinct colors and stores 1 pixel per 2-byte WORD. Each WORD can define the alpha, red, green and blue samples of the pixel.
* The 24-bit per pixel (24bpp) format supports 16,777,216 distinct colors and stores 1 pixel value per 3 bytes. Each pixel value defines the red, green and blue samples of the pixel (8.8.8.0.0 in RGBAX notation). Specifically, in the order: blue, green and red (8 bits per each sample).
* The 32-bit per pixel (32bpp) format supports 4,294,967,296 distinct colors and stores 1 pixel per 4-byte DWORD. Each DWORD can define the alpha, red, green and blue samples of the pixel.

In order to resolve the ambiguity of which bits define which samples, the DIB headers provide certain defaults as well as specific BITFIELDS, which are bit masks that define the membership of particular group of bits in a pixel to a particular channel. The following diagram defines this mechanism:

The sample fields defined by the BITFIELDS bit masks have to be contiguous and non-overlapping, but the order of the sample fields is arbitrary. The most ubiquitous field order is: Alpha, Blue, Green, Red (MSB to LSB). The red, green and blue bit masks are valid only when the Compression member of the DIB header is set to BI_BITFIELDS. The alpha bit mask is valid whenever it is present in the DIB header or when the Compression member of the DIB header is set to BI_ALPHABITFIELDS (Windows CE only).

=== RGB video subtypes ===
The BITFIELD mechanism described above allows for the definition of tens of thousands of different pixel formats, however only several of them are used in practice, all palettized formats RGB8, RGB4, and RGB1 (marked in yellow in the table above, defined in codice_1.MEDIASUBTYPE names):

In version 2.1.4 FFmpeg supported (in its own terminology) the BMP pixel formats &quot;bgra, bgr24, rgb565le, rgb555le, rgb444le, rgb8, bgr8, rgb4_byte, bgr4_byte, gray, pal8,&quot; and &quot;monob&quot;; i.e., &quot;bgra&quot; was the only supported pixel format with transparency.

=== Example 1 ===

Following is an example of a 2×2 pixel, 24-bit bitmap (Windows DIB header ) with pixel format RGB24.

=== Example 2 ===
Following is an example of a 4×2 pixel, 32-bit bitmap with opacity values in the alpha channel (Windows DIB Header ) with pixel format ARGB32.

Note that the bitmap data starts with the lower left hand corner of the image.

== Usage of BMP format ==
The simplicity of the BMP file format, and its widespread familiarity in Windows and elsewhere, as well as the fact that this format is relatively well documented and has an open format, makes BMP a very common format that image processing programs from many operating systems can read and write. ICO and CUR files contain bitmaps starting with a BITMAPINFOHEADER.

Many older graphical user interfaces used bitmaps in their built-in graphics subsystems; for example, the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 platforms&#x27; GDI subsystem, where the specific format used is the &quot;Windows and OS/2 bitmap file format&quot;, usually named with the file extension of codice_2.

While most BMP files have a relatively large file size due to lack of any compression (or generally low-ratio run-length encoding on palletized images), many BMP files can be considerably compressed with lossless data compression algorithms such as ZIP because they contain redundant data. Some formats, such as RAR, even include routines specifically targeted at efficient compression of such data.

== Related formats ==

The X Window System uses a similar XBM format for black-and-white images, and XPM (&quot;pixelmap&quot;) for color images. There are also a variety of &quot;raw&quot; formats, which save raw data with no other information. The Portable Pixmap (PPM) and Truevision TGA formats also exist, but are less often used – or only for special purposes; for example, TGA can contain transparency information.

<doc id="250340" wikidata="Q274562" url="?curid=250340" title="Loreena McKennitt">
<text>Loreena Isabel Irene McKennitt (born February 17, 1957) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer who writes, records, and performs world music with Celtic and Middle Eastern influences. McKennitt is known for her refined and clear soprano vocals. She has sold more than 14 million records worldwide.

== Early life and education ==
McKennitt was born in Morden, Manitoba, of Irish and Scottish descent to parents Jack McKennitt (died 1992) and Irene née Dickey (1931–2011). In Morden, she developed her love for music, influenced, in part, by the musical traditions of the local Mennonite community.

McKennitt enrolled at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg to become a veterinarian. While in Winnipeg she discovered folk music, including fellow Canadians Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Gordon Lightfoot. After performing at the inaugural Winnipeg Folk Festival in 1974, McKennitt developed an interest in Celtic music and visited Ireland to hear it for herself. Developing a passion for Celtic music, she learned to play the Celtic harp and began busking at various places, including St. Lawrence Market in Toronto to earn money to record her first album.

In 1981, she moved to Stratford, Ontario to join the Stratford Festival acting company; she still resides there.

== Career ==

=== Initial success: 1985–1998 ===
McKennitt&#x27;s first album, &quot;Elemental&quot;, was released in 1985, followed by &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away&quot; (1987), &quot;Parallel Dreams&quot; (1989), &quot;The Visit&quot; (1991), &quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot; (1994), &quot;A Winter Garden&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; (1997). All of her work is released under her own label, Quinlan Road.

In 1990, McKennitt provided the music for the National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;The Burning Times&quot;, a feminist revisionist account of the Early Modern European witchcraft trials. She and the musical team she headed would later re-record the documentary&#x27;s main theme on her album &quot;The Visit&quot; under the title &quot;Tango to Evora&quot;.

In 1993, she toured Europe supporting Mike Oldfield. In 1995, her version of the traditional Irish song &quot;Bonny Portmore&quot; was featured in the &quot;Highlander&quot; series, followed by the 1994 film &quot;Highlander 3: The Sorcerer&quot;. McKennitt&#x27;s single &quot;The Mummers&#x27; Dance&quot; received airplay in North American markets during the spring of 1997, and was used as the theme song for the short-lived TV series &quot;Legacy&quot;. It also saw use in the trailer for a wide-release 1998 Drew Barrymore film &quot;Ever After&quot;.

Her music appeared in the movies &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;Jade&quot;, &quot;Holy Man&quot;, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, and &quot;Tinker Bell&quot;. It was also featured in the television series &quot;Roar&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, and &quot;Full Circle (Women and Spirituality)&quot;.

=== Personal tragedy and hiatus ===
In July 1998, McKennitt&#x27;s fiancé Ronald Rees, his brother Richard, and their close friend Gregory Cook drowned in a boating accident on Georgian Bay. She was deeply affected by the event, and she founded the Cook-Rees Memorial Fund for Water Search and Safety in the same year. At the time of the incident, she was working on a live album of two performances called &quot;Live in Paris and Toronto&quot;. The proceeds from this album were donated to the newly created memorial fund, totalling some three million dollars.

After the release of the live album, McKennitt decided that she would substantially reduce the number of her public performances, and she did not release any new recordings.

=== Return to music: 2006–present ===
During 2005, McKennitt began working on the album &quot;An Ancient Muse&quot;, her seventh full-length studio album, released in November 2006. In September 2006, she performed live at the Alhambra in Spain. The performance premiered on PBS and in August 2007 was released on a three-disc DVD/CD set titled &quot;Nights from the Alhambra&quot;.

In 2008, McKennitt wrote and composed &quot;To the Fairies They Draw Near&quot; for the theme song for Disney&#x27;s direct-to-video animated film &quot;Tinker Bell&quot;. She also provided the narration for the film.

In early 2008, she returned to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios to record &quot;A Midwinter Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, an extended version of her 1995 mini-album &quot;A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season&quot;. The album was released on October 28, 2008.

Since the release of &quot;An Ancient Muse&quot;, McKennitt has toured consistently, in Europe and North American, including the &quot;An Ancient Muse tour&quot; in 2007, another extensive tour across Canada and United States later in 2007, a tour of Europe in 2008 and a Mediterranean tour in 2009 with stops in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Hungary and Italy.

On September 17, 2009, McKennitt announced the release of a two-disc album, &quot;A Mediterranean Odyssey&quot;. The first CD, &quot;From Istanbul to Athens&quot;, consisted of 10 new live recordings from her 2009 Mediterranean tour, including songs she had never before recorded in concert. The second CD, &quot;The Olive and the Cedar&quot;, had a Mediterranean theme which McKennitt herself curated. It contained previously released studio recordings created between 1994 and 2006.

November 16, 2010, saw the US release (November 12 for Europe) of McKennitt&#x27;s studio album, &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;. Recorded at the Sharon Temple in Ontario, the album comprises nine traditional Celtic songs. 

When McKennitt released &quot;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&quot; she visited several countries to help promote the album. During the promotional tour she performed an hour-long concert in the studios of German radio station SWR1, accompanied only by Brian Hughes (guitars) and Caroline Lavelle (cello) who have long been part of her tours and recordings. This live concert was released on CD in 2011. Called &quot;Troubadours on the Rhine&quot;, the album was nominated for a 2012 Grammy for Best New Age Album.

On November 30, 2012, McKennitt lent her support to Kate Winslet&#x27;s Golden Hat Foundation together with Tim Janis, Sarah McLachlan, Andrea Corr, Hayley Westenra, the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys, Dawn Kenney, Jana Mashonee, Amy Petty, and a choir, along with others, performing on &quot;The American Christmas Carol&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall.

McKennitt&#x27;s 10th studio album, &quot;Lost Souls&quot;, was released on May 11, 2018. She planned a tour to support the album&#x27;s release in 2018 and 2019.

She had a small acting role in the 2018 film &quot;Road to the Lemon Grove&quot;, as the voice of God.

In 2019, McKennitt released the live album &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, recorded earlier that year in London.

== Legacy ==

=== Genre ===

McKennitt&#x27;s music has generally been classified as World or Celtic music even though it contains aspects and characteristics of music from around the globe and is sometimes classified as folk music in record stores.

McKennitt is occasionally compared to Enya, but McKennitt&#x27;s music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; by Lord Tennyson, &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Speech&quot; (the final soliloquy in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;), the Northumbrian murder ballad &quot;The Twa Sisters&quot; (which inspired &quot;The Bonny Swans&quot; on &quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot;), &quot;Snow&quot; by Archibald Lampman, &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; by St. John of the Cross, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Lullaby&quot;, Yeats&#x27; &quot;The Stolen Child,&quot; &quot;The English Ladye and the Knight&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, and &quot;The Highwayman&quot; by Alfred Noyes.

=== Influences ===
Before McKennitt composes any music, she engages in considerable research on a specific subject which then forms the general concept of the album. Before creating &quot;Elemental&quot; and &quot;Parallel Dreams&quot;, she travelled to Ireland for inspiration from the country&#x27;s history, folklore, geography and culture. The album &quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot; was preceded by research in Spain where she studied Galicia, a Celtic section of Spain, along with its abundant Arabic roots. The result was an album that included elements of Celtic and Arabic music. According to the jacket notes, her album &quot;An Ancient Muse&quot; was inspired by travels among and reading about the various cultures along the Silk Road.

=== Documentaries ===
Late in the 1990s, McKennitt created &quot;No Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, a half-hour documentary, for American television in which she discussed the influences behind her music. &quot;No Journey&#x27;s End&quot; contained excerpts from several songs from the albums &quot;Parallel Dreams,&quot; &quot;The Visit&quot;, and &quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot; It also shows live performances of the songs &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, &quot;Santiago&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Night of the Soul&quot;. It was later released on DVD and VHS, the former also containing music videos for &quot;The Mummers&#x27; Dance&quot; and &quot;The Bonny Swans.&quot; A bonus copy of the DVD was included with the 2004 remastered versions of McKennitt&#x27;s CDs.

In 2008, McKennitt released &quot;A Moveable Musical Feast&quot;, based on her 2007 &quot;An Ancient Muse&quot; tour. The DVD included interviews with McKennitt, her band, crew, fans and professional colleagues from the Canadian music industry.

=== Court case ===

In 2005, McKennitt was involved in an acrimonious court case in England when her former friend and employee, Niema Ash, published a book, &quot;Travels with Loreena McKennitt: My Life as a Friend&quot;, that contained intimate details of their friendship. McKennitt argued that much of the book contained confidential personal information that Ash had no right to publish. The English courts found that there had indeed been a breach of confidence and a misuse of McKennitt&#x27;s private information, and the case set important precedents in the law of England and Wales on the privacy of public figures. The House of Lords affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decisions in 2007.

<text>Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer (17 May 1836 – 16 August 1920) was an English scientist and astronomer. Along with the French scientist Pierre Janssen, he is credited with discovering the gas helium. Lockyer also is remembered for being the founder and first editor of the influential journal &quot;Nature&quot;.

==Biography==

Lockyer was born in Rugby, Warwickshire. His early introduction to science was through his father, who was a pioneer of the electric telegraph. After a conventional schooling supplemented by travel in Switzerland and France, he worked for some years as a civil servant in the British War Office. He settled in Wimbledon, South London after marrying Winifred James, who helped translate at least four French scientific works into English. 
He was a keen amateur astronomer with a particular interest in the Sun. In 1885 he became the world&#x27;s first professor of astronomical physics at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington, now part of Imperial College. At the college, the Solar Physics Observatory was built for him and here he directed research until 1913.

In the 1860s Lockyer became fascinated by electromagnetic spectroscopy as an analytical tool for determining the composition of heavenly bodies. He conducted his research from his new home in West Hampstead, with a -inch telescope which he had already used in Wimbledon.

In 1868 a prominent yellow line was observed in a spectrum taken near the edge of the Sun. Its wavelength was about 588 nm, slightly less than the so-called &quot;D&quot; lines of sodium. The line could not be explained as due to any material known at the time, and so it was suggested by Lockyer, after he had observed it from London, that the yellow line was caused by an unknown solar element. He named this element helium after the Greek word &#x27;Helios&#x27; meaning &#x27;sun&#x27;. An observation of the new yellow line had been made earlier by Janssen at the 18 August 1868 solar eclipse
, and because their papers reached the French academy on the same day, he and Lockyer usually are awarded joint credit for helium&#x27;s discovery. Terrestrial helium was found about 27 years later by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay. In his work on the identification of helium, Lockyer collaborated with the noted chemist Edward Frankland.

To facilitate the transmission of ideas between scientific disciplines, Lockyer established the general science journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1869. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1874. He remained its editor until shortly before his death.

Lockyer led eight expeditions to observe solar eclipses for example in 1870 to Sicily, 1871 to India and 1898 to India.

Lockyer is among the pioneers of archaeoastronomy. Travelling 1890 in Greece he noticed the east–west orientation of many temples, in Egypt he found an orientation of temples to sunrise at midsummer and towards Sirius. Assuming orientation of the Heel-Stone of Stonehenge to sunrise at midsummer he calculated the construction of the monument to have taken place in 1680 BC. Radiocarbon dating in 1952 gave a date of 1800 BC. He also confirmed the alignment of the Parthenon on the rising point of the Pleiades and did extensive work on the solar and stellar alignments of Egyptian temples and their dating, presented in his book The Dawn Of Astronomy.

Lockyer&#x27;s first wife Winifred née James died in 1879. They had six sons and two daughters in all. In 1903, Lockyer started a second marriage, to suffragist Thomazine Mary Brodhurst (née Browne). After his retirement in 1913, Lockyer established an observatory near his home in Salcombe Regis near Sidmouth, Devon. Originally known as the Hill Observatory, the site was renamed the Norman Lockyer Observatory after his death and directed by his fifth son William J.S. Lockyer. For a time the observatory was a part of the University of Exeter, but is now owned by the East Devon District Council, and run by the Norman Lockyer Observatory Society. The Norman Lockyer Chair in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter is currently held by Professor Tim Naylor, who is the member of the Astrophysics group there which studies star formation and extrasolar planets. Naylor was the lead scientist for the eSTAR Project.

Lockyer died at his home in Salcombe Regis in 1920, and was buried there in the churchyard of St Peter and St Mary.

<doc id="250347" wikidata="Q9300236" url="?curid=250347" title="Demarcation point">
<text>In telephony, the demarcation point is the point at which the public switched telephone network ends and connects with the customer&#x27;s on-premises wiring. It is the dividing line which determines who is responsible for installation and maintenance of wiring and equipment—customer/subscriber, or telephone company/provider. The demarcation point varies between countries and has changed over time.

&quot;Demarcation point&quot; is sometimes abbreviated as demarc, DMARC, or similar. The term MPOE (minimum or main point of entry) is synonymous, with the added implication that it occurs as soon as possible upon entering the customer premises. A network interface device often serves as the demarcation point.

==History==
Prior to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations separating the ownership of customer premises telecommunication equipment from the telephone network, there was no need for a public standard governing the interconnection of customer premises equipment (CPE) to the United States&#x27; telephone network, since both the devices and the “local loop” wiring to the central office were owned and maintained by the local telephone company. 
Concurrent with the transfer of existing &quot;embedded&quot; CPE to the customer (customers could buy new telephones at retail or could continue to lease their existing equipment from the company), it was necessary to provide a standardized way to connect equipment, and also provide a way to test the phone company&#x27;s service separately from the customer&#x27;s equipment.

The ability of customers to buy and maintain their CPE and attach it to the network was stimulated by lawsuits by equipment manufacturers, such as the Hush-a-Phone v. FCC suit. Additionally, computer companies’ ability to offer enhanced services to customers was likewise constrained by the telephone companies’ control of all devices connected to the network. As the Bell telephone companies were themselves restricted from offering such enhanced services, there was little momentum to advance the state of the art.

The newly developed equipment-network separation was codified in Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations in the United States and later in comparable regulatory standards in other countries.

The physical and electrical interconnection is called the demarcation point, or Demarc, which includes one or more customer-accessible jack interfaces; previously, the interface was typically hard-wired and often in a telephone company-owned locked enclosure.

The premises-vs.-network separation in the United States, insofar as it affected the former Bell System, was independent of AT&amp;T&#x27;s divestiture of the local telephone companies on January 1, 1984. However, CPE interconnection and Bell System divestiture were part of a larger restructuring of the domestic telecommunications industry which took place during the 1980s and are commonly, if inaccurately, seen as one event. The historical Bell System domination of the United States telecommunications industry was also the de facto standard for other telephone companies such as GTE and other “independent” telephone companies.

==Equipment==
===Canada===

The demarcation point varies from building type and service level. In its simplest form, the demarcation point is a junction block where telephone extensions join to connect to the network. This junction block usually includes a lightning arrester (which requires a wire to ground). In multi-line installations such as businesses or apartment buildings, the demarcation point may be a punch down block. In most places this hardware existed before deregulation.

===United States===
In the United States, the modern demarcation point is a device defined by FCC rules (47 C.F.R. Part 68) to allow safe connection of third-party telephone customer-premises equipment and wiring to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
The modern demarcation point is the network interface device (NID) or intelligent network interface device (INID) also known as a &quot;smartjack&quot;. The NID is the telco&#x27;s property. The NID may be outdoors (typically, mounted on the building exterior in a weatherproof box) or indoors.

The NID is usually placed for easy access by a technician. It also contains a lightning arrestor, fuse and test circuitry which allows the carrier to remotely test whether a wiring fault lies in the customer premises or in the carrier wiring, without requiring a technician at the premises. The demarcation point has a user accessible RJ-11 jack (a &quot;test jack&quot; or &quot;demarcation jack&quot;), which is connected directly to the telephone network, and a small loop of telephone cord connecting to the jack by a modular connector.

When the loop is disconnected, the on-premises wiring is isolated from the telephone network and the customer may directly connect a telephone to the network via the jack to assist in determining the location of a wiring fault. In most cases, everything from the central office to and including the demarcation point is owned by the carrier and everything past it is owned by the property owner.

As the local loop becomes upgraded, with fiber optic and coaxial cable technologies sometimes replacing the original unshielded twisted pair to the premises, the demarcation point has grown to incorporate the equipment necessary to interface the original premises POTS wiring and equipment to the new communication channel.

Demarcation points on houses built prior to the Bell System divestiture usually do not contain a test jack. They only contained a spark-gap surge protector, a grounding post and mount point to connect a single telephone line. The second wire pair was usually left unconnected and were kept as a spare pair in case the first pair was damaged.

DEMARCs that handle both telephony and IT fiber optic internet lines often do not look like the ones pictured above. In many places several customers share one central DEMARC for a commercial or strip mall setting. Usually a DEMARC will be located indoors if it is serving more than a single customer. This may impede access. Outdoor ones provide easier access, without disturbing other tenants, but call for weatherproofing and punching through a wall for each new addition of wires and service.

Typically indoor DEMARC&#x27;s will be easily identified by a patch panel of telephone wires on the wall next to a series of boxes with RJ48 jacks for T-1 lines. Each business or individual customer can expect their own separate box for internet access T-1 lines.

==== Demarcation point extension ====
A demarcation point extension, or demarc extension is the transmission path originating from the interface of the access provider&#x27;s side of a demarcation point within a premises and ending at the termination point prior to the interface of the edge Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). This may include in-segment equipment, media converters and patch cords as required to complete the circuit&#x27;s transmission path to the edge CPE. A demarc extension is more correctly termed &quot;Service Interface Extension&quot;, and may also be referred to as inside wiring, extended demarc, circuit extension, CPE cabling, riser cabling or DMARC extension.

A demarc extension became an important factor to consider in a building&#x27;s telecommunications infrastructure after the 1984 deregulation of AT&amp;T as well as the supplemental FCC rulings of 1991, 1996 and 1997. Preceding these rulings, the Bell System Companies held a monopoly and did not allow an interconnection with third party equipment. The incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) and other local access providers are now mandated by federal law to provide a point where the operational control or ownership changes. This separation between the local access provider and the end user/subscriber is called the demarcation point within a facility (typically a short distance from the minimum point of entry). This then becomes the responsibility of the end user to extend their service to the CPE location within a facility to provide connectivity for service, requiring a service interface extension, or otherwise called a demarc extension.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the demarcation point occurs on the LJU master socket, whose wiring is partly owned by the customer, partly owned by the phone company. Other secondary sockets are the customer&#x27;s property. Newer NTE-5 master phone sockets have a removable front panel: the front panel and its wiring is the customer&#x27;s, while the rear wiring is Openreach&#x27;s.

The removable panel allows separation of these two parts and independent maintenance, and access to a test socket to determine whether line faults are in the customer&#x27;s wiring or Openreach&#x27;s (formerly BT&#x27;s) external network.

<doc id="250349" wikidata="Q5471076" url="?curid=250349" title="Fort Donelson">
<text>Fort Donelson was a fortress built early in 1862 by the Confederacy during the American Civil War to control the Cumberland River, which led to the heart of Tennessee, and thereby the Confederacy. The fort was named after Confederate general Daniel S. Donelson.

The Union Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, who later became president, captured the fort in February 1862 from the Confederate Army in the Battle of Fort Donelson. This was a great strategic victory for the Union forces, and part of Grant&#x27;s campaign to gain control of the Mississippi River. Union forces occupied the fort (and much of Tennessee) for the remainder of the war. A small detachment of Confederate troops made one unsuccessful attempt in 1863 to regain it.

==History==
Bushrod Johnson of the Confederate Corps of Engineers had approved the build site and supervised construction completed in early 1862. The site commanded a bend on the west side of the Cumberland River, It was planned to support Fort Henry, which is located on a bend in the Tennessee River about 10 miles to the west. To the north flows Hickman River, a backwater channel that was impassable except by boat or bridge, and to the east a small tributary named Indian Creek enters the Cumberland. The fort, which was intended to house troops and protect the water batteries from sorties, had a few acres of log huts. 

Like Fort Henry, which fell to Union troops on February 6, Fort Donelson would not be able to defeat a large-scale assault, but officers wanted to be able hold the position as long as possible. Engineers began improving defensive positions by digging rifle pits along a ridgeline and breastworks were built in &quot;a three-mile arc which inclosed the bluff on the north, and the county seat hamlet of Dover on the south, the main supply base.&quot; Cannons, including a 128-pounder and two 32-pounders, were placed atop the hundred-foot bluff within the arc. Construction was started by a large force of workers brought from the nearby Cumberland Iron Works.

Confederate commanders
* Bushrod Johnson (Feb 9, 1862)
* Gideon J. Pillow (Feb 10–13, 1862)
* John B. Floyd (Feb 14–16, 1862)
* Simon B. Buckner, Sr. (Feb 16, 1862)
* Major Rice E. Graves, Jr., Artillery Commander

Fort Donelson was garrisoned by the Confederate troops until 1862. The fort was captured by Union General Ulysses S. Grant and his army during a winter offensive to control of the Mississippi River. Grant believed that such control would enable him to divide the Confederacy in two. (see Battle of Fort Donelson)

On August 25, 1863, a Confederate force attacked the fort and demanded surrender by Union troops. Their attack was unsuccessful and was repulsed by the Union garrison.

===Union attack===
Fort Donelson was attacked by General U.S Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Foote, who surrounded the fort and captured it after a short siege. On February 6, Grant was ordered by General Henry Halleck to assault Fort Donelson immediately and capture it by February 8. Grant made reconnaissance, observed the natural obstacles and Confederate improvements, and knew the fort would not be taken by the 8th. He organized and had Brigadier Generals John A. McClernand, Charles F. Smith, and Lew Wallace prepare for a land assault while Flag Officer Foote moved his gunboats to assault from the river. After minor skirmishes with Confederate cavalry en route, the assault on Fort Donelson began on February 12. On February 14, a naval battle took place, in which Union ships suffered serious damage. After attempting in vain to escape their tenuous position on February 15 via roads to Nashville, the Confederates capitulated, surrendering Fort Donelson to the Union on February 16.

===Fort Donelson under Union control===

The Union was ecstatic when the news of Fort Donelson&#x27;s surrender reached the capital and cities. Union forces now controlled one of the largest forts in the western theater. The war had been going badly for the Union in Virginia, but the captures of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson were promising victories.

After the front line shifted away from Fort Donelson, it became of little strategic importance, but continued to hold a garrison of Union troops. Later, the fort was attacked by a Confederate force of 450 infantrymen, 335 cavalrymen, and two field guns. The Union garrison consisted of four companies (404 men) of the 71st Ohio Regiment. After suffering 30 casualties, the Confederates retreated. They were pursued by the Fifth Iowa Cavalry, but to no avail.

Union commanders
* Ulysses S. Grant (Feb 1862)
* Abner Harding (Sept 1862–1863)
* William W. Lowe (Feb 1863)

===After the war===

The Fort Donelson National Battlefield was created in 1928, and the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It was redesignated as a national battlefield on August 16, 1985. Fort Heiman was later incorporated into the park.

<doc id="250355" wikidata="Q465000" url="?curid=250355" title="Elizabeth Siddal">
<text>Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall (25 July 1829 – 11 February 1862), better known as Elizabeth Siddal (a spelling she adopted in 1853), was an English artist, art model, and poet. Siddal was perhaps the most significant of the female models who posed for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Their ideas of female beauty were fundamentally influenced and personified by her. Walter Deverell and William Holman Hunt painted Siddal, and she was the model for John Everett Millais&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Ophelia&quot; (1852). Early in her relationship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Siddal became his muse and exclusive model, and he portrayed her in almost all his early artwork depicting women.

Siddal became an artist in her own right and was the only woman to exhibit at an 1857 Pre-Raphaelite exhibition. Significant collections of her artworks can be found at Wightwick Manor and the Ashmolean Museum. Sickly and melancholic during the last decade of her life, Siddal died of a laudanum overdose in 1862 during her second year of marriage to Rossetti.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, named after her mother, was born on 25 July 1829, at the family&#x27;s home at 7Charles Street, Hatton Garden, at the time in the parish of Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents and Ely Place in central London. Her parents were Charles Crooke Siddall, and Elizabeth Eleanor Evans, from a family of English and Welsh descent. She had two older siblings, Ann and Charles Robert. At the time of her birth, her father had a cutlery-making business.

About 1831, the Siddall family moved to the less affluent borough of Southwark, in south London. The remainder of the Siddall children were born in Southwark: Lydia, to whom she was particularly close; Mary, Clara, James and Henry. Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall &quot;received an ordinary education, conformable to her condition in life&quot; and first &quot;read Tennyson ... by finding one or two poems of his on a piece of paper&quot; that had been wrapped around some butter. Literary analysts have noted that her artwork sometimes used subjects from Tennyson&#x27;s writings and that his writings may have influenced her poetry.

==Pre-Raphaelite model==

In 1849, while working at a millinery in Cranbourne Alley, London, Siddal made the acquaintance of Walter Deverell. Accounts differ on the circumstances of their meeting. One account is that she became acquainted with Deverell&#x27;s father, who worked at the Government School of Design, then at Somerset House. Siddal showed some of her artwork to him, and he introduced her to his son. In another account, William Allingham visited the milliner&#x27;s to meet a woman he was acquainted with and admired; Siddal was the woman&#x27;s co-worker and joined the pair on their walk home, as it was the women&#x27;s usual practice to travel home from work together. Siddal made such an impression on Allingham that he recommended her as a possible model to his friend Deverell, who was struggling with a large oil painting based on the Shakespeare play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

A third account has Deverell accompanying his mother to the millinery where he noticed Siddal in the back of the shop. In any case, Deverell later described Siddal as &quot;magnificently tall, with a lovely figure, and a face of the most delicate and finished modelling... she has grey eyes, and her hair is like dazzling copper, and shimmers with luster.&quot; Deverell subsequently employed Siddal as a model and introduced her to the Pre-Raphaelites.

As with the other Pre-Raphaelites, Deverell took his inspiration directly from life rather than from an idealized classical figure. In his &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; painting, he based Orsino on himself, Feste on his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Viola/Cesario on Siddal. This was the first time Siddal sat as a model. According to William Michael Rossetti, Dante Gabriel&#x27;s brother, &quot;Deverell drew another Viola from her, in an etching for &quot;The Germ&quot;.&quot; Elaine Shefer asserts that Deverell portrayed Siddal in &quot;A Pet&quot; and &quot;The Grey Parrot&quot;.

William Holman Hunt painted her in &quot;A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids&quot; (1849–1850) and &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona, Valentine Rescuing Sylvia From Proteus&quot; (1850 or 1851).

For John Everett Millais&#x27;s &quot;Ophelia&quot;, Siddal floated in a bathtub full of water to portray the drowning Ophelia. Millais painted daily through the winter, putting oil lamps under the tub to warm the water. On one occasion, the lamps went out and the water became icy cold. Millais, absorbed by his painting, did not notice and Siddal did not complain. After this, she became ill with a severe cold or pneumonia. Her father held Millais responsible and, under the threat of legal action, Millais paid her doctor&#x27;s bills.

Siddal came to either embody or influence the Pre-Raphaelite ideals of feminine beauty.

==Artwork and poetry==

In 1853, Siddal signed &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; as &quot;E. E. Siddal&quot;, the first time she had signed one of her works and an early instance of her shortened surname. By that same year, Rossetti had taken Siddal on as a student. He told his friend Ford Madox Brown that her &quot;fecundity of invention and facility are quite wonderful, much greater than mine&quot;. Siddal seems to have inspired Rossetti, as he followed her in depicting the same subjects, and he reused her designs after her death.

Siddal&#x27;s 1854 &quot;self-portrait&quot; (see right) diverged from the Pre-Raphaelites&#x27; typical idealised beauty. As Anna Solomon wrote, &quot;she depicts herself looking harsher, angrier and less attractive than the languid Siddal of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings.&quot; From 1855 to 1857, art critic John Ruskin subsidised her career and paid £150 per year in exchange for all the drawings and paintings she produced. She produced many sketches, drawings, and watercolours as well as one oil painting. Her sketches are similar to other Pre-Raphaelite compositions illustrating Arthurian legend and other idealized medieval themes, and she was the only woman who exhibited with the Pre-Raphaelites at an 1857 exhibition at No. 4 Russell Place, Fitzroy Square, London. That same year, Siddal studied at the Sheffield School of Art.

During Siddal&#x27;s career as an artist and poet from 1852 to 1861, she produced more than a hundred works. Unpublished during her lifetime, her poetry often dwelt on dark themes, lost love, or the impossibility of true love. Her small poetic output was nonetheless accomplished. Constance Hassett wrote that &quot;Siddal&#x27;s poetry ranges from the perfectly realized ballad narrative, to its opposite, the overheard lyric, and to something in between, the made-to-be heard monologue.&quot; Critic William Gaunt wrote that &quot;Her verses were as simple and moving as ancient ballads; her drawings were as genuine in their medieval spirit as much more highly finished and competent works of Pre-Raphaelite art.&quot;

==Relationship with Rossetti==

Dante Gabriel Rossetti met Siddal in 1849, probably while they both modelled for Deverell. Rossetti gave Siddal the nickname &quot;Lizzie&quot; when she entered the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood circle, and &quot;the diminutive enhanced her youthful, dependent role&quot;. By 1851 or 1852, they became engaged. Siddal had also become Rossetti&#x27;s main model and muse, and he stopped her from modelling for others.

In 1852, Siddal began to study with Rossetti. She started staying at his Chatham Place residence, sometimes with him and sometimes by herself. They subsequently became anti-social and absorbed in each other&#x27;s affections. They coined affectionate nicknames for one another, such as &quot;Guggums&quot; or &quot;Gug&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot;, the latter one of Rossetti&#x27;s names for Siddal. He also shortened the spelling of her surname to Siddal, dropping the second &quot;l&quot;.

During this period, Rossetti&#x27;s most abundant and personal works were his pencil sketches of Siddal at home, most of which he entitled simply &quot;Elizabeth Siddal&quot;. He portrayed Siddal in moments of leisure, such as reading, sitting, or in repose, or when painting or drawing. She also became the subject of much of Rossetti&#x27;s poetry throughout their relationship and particularly after her death. Rossetti became obsessive in portraying Siddal. It has been estimated that there are thousands of Rossetti&#x27;s drawings, paintings, and poems in which Siddal was a subject.

Beginning in 1853, Rossetti used Siddal as a model for a series of Dante-themed paintings, including &quot;The First Anniversary of the Death of Beatrice&quot; (1852), &quot;Beatrice Meeting Dante at a Marriage Feast, Denies him her Salutation&quot; (1851), &quot;Dante&#x27;s Vision of Rachel and Leah&quot; (1855), and, perhaps his most famous portrait of her, &quot;Beata Beatrix&quot; (1864–1870), which he painted as a memorial after her death.

As Siddal came from a working-class family, Rossetti feared introducing her to his family. Siddal was the victim of harsh criticism from his sisters. The knowledge that his family would not approve contributed to Rossetti&#x27;s delaying the marriage. Siddal appears to have believed, with some justification, that Rossetti was always seeking to replace her with a younger muse, which contributed to her later depressive periods and illness. Although Ruskin urged Rossetti to marry in 1855, their relationship deteriorated: the reasons probably included Siddal&#x27;s ill-health, her laudanum addiction, Rossetti&#x27;s philandering, Rossetti&#x27;s lack of funds, the aforementioned disapproval of the Rossetti family, and Rossetti&#x27;s probable aversion to marriage in general.

In 1857, Siddal gave up her stipend from Ruskin and went to Sheffield, the birth place of her father, to attend the school of art there. She moved in with her cousin&#x27;s family. A son of this family, Willie Ibbett, proposed to her, but she indicated that she was already engaged. However, by mid-1858, Siddal and Rossetti appeared to be both done with their engagement and little is known about Siddal from that time until 1860.
In Spring 1860, Siddal&#x27;s family contacted Ruskin with the news that Siddal was gravely ill. Ruskin in turn informed Rossetti. Siddal was at the seaside resort of Hastings. In a change of heart, Rossetti hurried to her side that April with a marriage licence. Shortly before their marriage, Rossetti produced a famous portrait of Siddal, &quot;Regina Cordium&quot; or &quot;The Queen of Hearts &quot;(1860). This painting is a close-up, vibrantly coloured depiction of Siddal.

Siddal and Rossetti married on Wednesday, 23 May 1860 at St. Clement&#x27;s Church in Hastings. There were no family or friends present, only a couple of witnesses whom they had asked. When Siddal&#x27;s health improved, they honeymooned in Paris and Boulogne in the latter half of 1860, then returned to the Chatham Place residence that they expanded into an adjoining house. Siddal became pregnant and appeared to be happier and healthier.

==Ill health and death==

It was thought that she suffered from tuberculosis, but some historians believe an intestinal disorder was more likely. Elbert Hubbard wrote that &quot;She suffered much from neuralgia, and the laudanum taken to relieve the pain had grown into a necessity.&quot; Others suggest that she may have been anorexic or that her poor health was due to laudanum addiction or a combination of ailments.

Siddal travelled to Paris and Nice for several years for her health. At the time of her wedding, she was so frail and ill that she had to be carried to the church, despite it being a five-minute walk from where she was staying. She became severely depressed and her long illness gave her access to laudanum to which she became addicted. By 1861, Siddal became pregnant, which ended with the birth of a stillborn daughter. The stillbirth left Siddal with post-partum depression. By early 1862, she had become pregnant for a second time.

Siddal overdosed on laudanum on 10 February 1862. She, Rossetti, and his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne had dined together in a nearby hotel. After having taken Siddal home, Rossetti attended his weekly lecture at the Working Men&#x27;s College. Upon returning home from teaching, Rossetti found Siddal unconscious in bed and could not revive her. The first doctor Rossetti called claimed that he was unable to save her, upon which Rossetti sent for another three doctors. A stomach pump was used, but to no avail. She died at 7:20am on 11 February 1862 at their home at 14 Chatham Place. Her obituary noted that she &quot;had expressed no wish to die, but quite the reverse. Indeed she contemplated going out of town in a day or two, and had ordered a new mantle which she intended to wear on the occasion.&quot; The coroner ruled her death as accidental; however, there are suggestions that Rossetti found a suicide note, with the words &quot;Please look after Harry&quot; (her invalid brother, who may have had a slight intellectual disability), supposedly &quot;pinned... on the breast of her night-shirt.&quot; Consumed with grief and guilt Rossetti allegedly went to see Ford Madox Brown who is supposed to have instructed him to burn the note. Since suicide was illegal and considered immoral, it would have brought scandal on the family and barred Siddal from a Christian burial.

==After Siddal&#x27;s death==

Siddal was buried with her father-in-law Gabriele on 17 February 1862 in the Rossetti family grave in the west side of Highgate Cemetery. Later burials in the same grave are her mother-in-law Frances Rossetti (1886), Christina Georgina Rossetti (1895), and William Michael Rossetti (1919).

In August 1869, Rossetti authorized Charles Howell to disinter her coffin to retrieve a handwritten book of Rossetti&#x27;s poems, which he had laid beside her head before burial. With the aid of a Dr. Llewelyn Williams and two others, Howell accomplished this in October 1869. Dr. Williams subsequently disinfected the book. Rossetti then published the contents in &quot;Poems&quot; (1870).

These became part of Rossetti&#x27;s sonnet sequence entitled &quot;The House of Life.&quot; This sequence contained the poem &quot;Without Her&quot;, a reflection on life once love has departed.

==Legacy==
Their home at 14 Chatham Place was demolished and is now covered by Blackfriars Station.

===Exhibitions and collections===

A retrospective of Siddal&#x27;s work was curated by Jan Marsh in 1991 at the Ruskin Gallery in Sheffield.

Rosalie Glynn Grylls bought some of Siddal&#x27;s works at auction in 1961. These works became part of Wightwick Manor, donated by her husband, Geoffrey Mander, and her to the National Trust. A 2018 exhibition, &quot;Beyond Ophelia&quot;, curated by National Trust Assistant Curator Hannah Squire, ran for nine months and featured twelve artworks by Siddal and owned by the National Trust. Only the second solo exhibition of her work, the exhibition examined Siddal&#x27;s career, artistic style, subject matter, and the recognition challenges she faced as a female artist.

Siddal was among the women featured in the 2019 &quot;Pre-Raphaelite Sisters&quot; exhibition at London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery.

In 2023, the Tate Gallery had an exhibition &quot;The Rossettis&quot; which included 17 of Siddal&#x27;s works.

===Works inspired by Siddal===
====Literature====

Writer and curator Jan Marsh wrote that those fascinated by Siddal included Swinburne, Oscar Wilde, and Arthur Symons. The artist and author Charles Ricketts confessed that &quot;Oh, we have all, when young, been in love with Miss Siddal.&quot; With the emerging fields of psychology and sexology, a reevaluation of Siddal in fiction, poems, and biographies occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. She became regarded as &quot;a morbid, hysterical, suicidal woman clinging to her virginity and angrily jealous of her rivals&quot;. By the mid-twentieth century, perceptions had changed again so that Siddal became &quot;a Pre-Raphaelite groupie, a child of the 1950s and 60s pop culture.&quot; More recently, authors and biographers have reassessed Siddal. In this reexamination, she emerges as &quot;partly a victim of masculine oppression and partly a rediscovered proto-feminist&quot;, and a rediscovery that includes &quot;a determined effort to detach Elizabeth Siddal&#x27;s story from that of Rossetti and the PRB, ... and present her with a biography of her own.&quot;

Along with Algernon Charles Swinburne, Siddal and Rossetti are the subjects of &quot;How They Met Themselves&quot;, which is part of &quot;The Sandman&quot; series by Neil Gaiman, drawn by Michael Zulli, and published in &quot;Vertigo: Winter&#x27;s Edge #3&quot; (2000). In it, a dying Lizzie drugged with laudanum has a last dream or vision in which the trio takes a train trip to a forest &quot;where they each would see their true love&quot;. This story bears the same title as a drawing and a painting by Rossetti that both depict Siddal.

====Television====
Rossetti&#x27;s relationship with Siddal has been the subject of television dramas, notably &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967), by Ken Russell, in which she was played by and Rossetti by Oliver Reed; &quot;The Love School&quot; (1975) in which she was played by Patricia Quinn; and &quot;Desperate Romantics&quot; (2009) in which she was played by Amy Manson. She was portrayed in a recurring role by Hannah Onslow in the Paramount+ adaptation of Elizabeth Macneal&#x27;s &quot;The Doll Factory&quot; (2023).

====Art====

Siddal is depicted on one of the plates in the &quot;Famous Women Dinner Service&quot; by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, (1932–1934), commissioned by the art historian, Kenneth Clark.

The Delaware Art Museum hosted a 2022 exhibit of Holly Trostle Brigham&#x27;s works inspired by and portraying Siddal in conjunction with its Pre-Raphaellite collection that includes works by and a Rossetti portrait of Siddal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artist / Maker / Culture: Siddal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====

The English guitarist-composer was moved to compose a suite for solo classical guitar entitled &quot;The Four Muses of Mr Rossetti&quot;, based on his interest in the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood and their wide ranging influence on the culture of the period. The four movements of the suite are dedicated to Elizabeth Siddal, Fanny Cornforth, Jane Morris and Alexa Wilding.

<text>Elvetham Heath is a residential area and civil parish, containing 1,894 homes on a site, just outside the north western boundary of the town of Fleet in the English county of Hampshire. Construction of Elvetham Heath began in the summer of 1999 and ended in June 2008. The population of the civil parish at the 2021 Census was 5,269.

==Location==
Elvetham Heath was built on reclaimed pine plantation/heathland between the M3 motorway and the London-Southampton railway line, north of Fleet town centre. Formerly known as Railroad Heath, it previously belonged to the local Calthorpe Estate.

Elvetham Heath serves as a commuter area to local towns; Basingstoke some to the west, Reading is to the north and London is to the northeast. The development is located precisely midway between Southampton and London. It is adjacent to the M3 motorway, from the M4, and from the M25. Fleet railway station is approximately from the centre of the development.

==Nature reserve==
The district has a Local Nature Reserve, Elvetham Heath LNR, managed by Hart District Council.

<text>Lucille Nelson Hegamin (November 29, 1894 – March 1, 1970) was an American singer and entertainer and an early African-American blues recording artist.

==Life and career==
Lucille Nelson was born in Macon, Georgia, the daughter of John and Minnie Nelson. From an early age she sang in local church choirs and theatre programs. By the age of 15 she was touring the US South with the Leonard Harper Minstrel Stock Company. In 1914 she settled in Chicago, Illinois, where, often billed as &quot;The Georgia Peach&quot;, she worked with Tony Jackson and Jelly Roll Morton before marrying the pianist-composer Bill Hegamin. She later told a biographer, &quot;I was a cabaret artist in those days, and never had to play theatres, and I sang everything from blues to popular songs, in a jazz style. I think I can say without bragging that I made the &#x27;St. Louis Blues&#x27; popular in Chicago; this was one of my feature numbers.&quot;

The Hegamins moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1918, then to New York City the following year. Bill Hegamin led the band accompanying his wife, the Blue Flame Syncopators; Jimmy Wade was a member of this ensemble.

In November 1920, Hegamin became the second African-American blues singer to record, after Mamie Smith. Hegamin made a series of recordings for Arto Records and then Paramount in 1922. One of her biggest hits was &quot;Arkansas Blues&quot;, recorded for Arto and released on many other labels, including Black Swan. She recorded one of Tom Delaney&#x27;s earliest compositions, &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot;, in 1921, and it went on to become a jazz standard. She subsequently played theatre dates but did not tour extensively.

Lucille Hegamin lived at the Shuffle Inn in Harlem from November 1921 to January 1922. On January 20, 1922, she competed in a blues singing contest with Daisy Martin, Alice Leslie Carter and Trixie Smith at the Fifteenth Infantry&#x27;s First Band Concert and Dance in New York City. Hegamin placed second to Smith in the contest, which was held at the Manhattan Casino. Then from February to May of that year she toured with the African-American musical revue &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; and this was the second of three companies. In the first company Florence Mills had the same role with the same musical revue.

From 1922 through late 1926 she recorded over forty sides for Cameo Records; in this association she was billed as &quot;The Cameo Girl&quot;. After her marriage to Bill Hegamin ended in 1923, her most frequent accompanist was the pianist J. Cyrill Fullerton. In 1926, she recorded with Clarence Williams&#x27;s band for the Columbia label. She sang with a band that was led by George &quot;Doc&quot; Hyder in 1927 for a show in Philadelphia. Further into the decade she performed in further revues with Hyder that were staged in Harlem theaters.

She performed in Williams&#x27;s Revue at the Lincoln Theater in New York and then in various revues in New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey, through 1934. In 1929 she performed on the radio program &quot;Negro Achievement Hour&quot;, on WABC, in New York. In 1932 she recorded two sides for Okeh Records.

About 1934, she retired from music as a profession and worked as a nurse. She came out of retirement in 1961 to record four songs, accompanied by a band led by Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, on the album &quot;Songs We Taught Your Mother&quot;, for Bluesville Records. In 1962 she recorded &quot;Basket of Blues&quot; for Spivey Records. She performed at a benefit concert for Mamie Smith at the Celebrity Club in New York City in 1964.

Hegamin died in Harlem Hospital, in New York City, on March 1, 1970, and was interred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, in Brooklyn, New York.

==Partial discography==


==Style==
Hegamin&#x27;s stylistic influences included Annette Hanshaw and Ruth Etting. According to Derrick Stewart-Baxter, &quot;Lucille&#x27;s clear, rich voice, with its perfect diction, and its jazz feeling, was well in the vaudeville tradition, and her repertoire was wide.&quot; Like Mamie Smith, Hegamin sang classic female blues in a lighter style, more influenced by pop tunes, than the rougher rural-style blues singers such as Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, who became more popular a few years later.

<text>Santos (, &quot;Saints&quot;), officially Municipality of Estância Balneária de Santos, is a city and municipality in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, founded in 1546 by the Portuguese nobleman Brás Cubas. It is located mostly on the island of São Vicente, which harbors both the city of Santos and the city of São Vicente, and partially on the mainland. It is the main city in the metropolitan region of Baixada Santista. The population is 433,656 (2020 est.) in an area of . The city is home to the Coffee Museum, where world coffee prices were once negotiated. There is also a football memorial, dedicated to the city&#x27;s greatest players, which includes Pelé, who spent the majority of his career with Santos Futebol Clube. Its beachfront garden, in length, figures in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest beachfront garden in the world.

==History==

===Early colonization===
There are reports about the island of São Vicente just two years after the official discovery of Brazil, in 1502, with the expedition of Amerigo Vespucci to explore the Brazilian coast. When passing through the island formerly named Goiaó (or Guaiaó) by the natives, the expedition decided to give it the name of São Vicente, for the day&#x27;s saint. However, in 1531, due to the decline of the Portuguese crown&#x27;s business in India, Brazil rose on importance. King D. João III sent for a squad for the demarcation of territories on the island of São Vicente. The captain, Martim Afonso de Sousa, discovered a small village and a dock, known as Porto de São Vicente. One of the exiles brought by Amerigo Vespucci&#x27;s expedition, Cosme Fernandes, had founded the trading village, which had boomed. Miguel Alfonso took the town by force, granting land on the island to settlers.

In 1543, with the completion of the construction of a chapel on a hillock in honor of Santa Catarina by Luís de Góis, Brás Cubas ordered the port to be moved to the site of Enguaguaçu, which was calmer. The town booked to facilitate the trade that was unlocked with this move. The Portuguese nobleman ordered the construction of Brazil&#x27;s second, and at the time only hospital, as Hospital da Santa Casa de Misericórdia is closed, similar to the Santa Casa de Lisboa. The hospital was called Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Todos os Santos in Olinda was closed. The new town of Enguaguaçu was then known as the town of Todos os Santos. There is speculation that the name Santos would come from the port of Santos in Lisbon, similar to the location of the new settlement. Hence, the region close to Outeiro was known as &quot;Vila do Porto de Santos&quot;, and later, just &quot;Santos&quot;.

===Twentieth Century===
The export of coffee from the Port of Santos gave rise to the city and mostly accounted for the wealth of the city at the turn of the 20th century. Export and import through its port have made it the modern city one finds today and turned it into the indispensable outlet for the production of the powerhouse that is São Paulo State. Adorning the landscape of the port city are the canals that are over a hundred years old. In 1899, Santos was the point of entry for the bubonic plague into Brazil. In 1924 it became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santos.

In October 2006, light crude oil was discovered off the coast in the Santos basin.

Santos became a tourist city from the 1910s onwards, with the construction of the International Hotel and Parque Balneário and the construction of the beach front gardens in 1935. To this day, tourism in Santos is one of the main economic activities, mainly linked to beaches and historical heritage.

==Geography==
Santos is about 50 km (31 mi) from the metropolis São Paulo, capital of the state São Paulo, which is also the most populous city in Brazil.

The municipality contains the Laje de Santos Marine State Park, created in 1993, the first marine park to be created by the state.
It is divided into two distinct geographic areas: the heavily urbanized island and the continental area, about 70% of which is protected. The areas differ radically in terms of population, economy and geography.

===Insular area===
Santos partially lies on the island of São Vicente (Saint Vincent), whose territory is divided with the neighboring municipality of São Vicente. It is a densely urbanized area of that houses almost all the inhabitants of the city. It includes a flat area - Plain Coastal extension of the State of São Paulo - which has altitudes that rarely go above twenty meters above sea level, and an area composed of isolated hills called the Mass of São Vicente, the former home and endowed an urban illegal occupation with a mix of families characterized by high and low incomes, whose height does not exceed 200 meters above sea level.

The flat region of the island is almost completely devoid of native vegetation, although in the north region of the island - especially in the Alemoa, Chico de Paula and Saboó neighbourhoods - there are still remnants of mangroves. Before the occupation of the area of the island by &#x27;chácaras&#x27; - rural residences, and subsequently by urbanization, there was a vast flooded land covered by mangroves, the native Atlantic Forest, and coastal vegetation.

On the city hills one can still find vast areas covered by the native Atlantic Forest, in spite of the existing &quot;chácaras&quot; and banana harvesting farms in the area. The &#x27;Lagoa da Saudade&#x27; (Homesickness Lagoon), a pond located in one of the aforementioned hills, Morro Nova Cintra, was known to host a kind of caiman. The lagoon is also a popular destination among families in the city due to its playgrounds, barbecue kiosks, picnic spots and green areas. The disordered occupation of the hills represents both an environmental as well as a geological risk: the deforestation leads to frequent landslides, mainly from January to March, the traditional rainy season in the region.

Most rivers in the island were channeled when engineer Saturnino de Brito designed the system of canals in the city. As examples, we can cite the rivers Dois Rios (&quot;Two Rivers&quot;) and Ribeirão dos Soldados (&quot;Soldiers Creek&quot;), which is nowadays referred by santistas as the &#x27;Canal 4&#x27; on Avenue Siqueira Campos.

Major water courses cut the island in the north, such as the Rio de São Jorge (St. George River), which suffers from the problems of pollution and silting due to the occupation of its banks by slums.

===Beaches===

*José Menino Beach
*Pompeia Beach
*Gonzaga Beach
*Boqueirão Beach
*Embaré Beach
*Aparecida Beach
*Ponta da Praia Beach

===Islands===
* Urubuqueçaba Island
* Barnabé Island
* Diana Island

===Climate===
Despite the fact that it is located just outside the tropics, Santos has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) with no real dry season. Tropical rainforest climates are typically found near the equator, so Santos featuring this type of climate is an exceptional situation. All months of the year average more than 60 mm of rainfall during the course of the year. Santos features warm weather throughout the year, though June in Santos is somewhat cooler (and drier) than January. Mean temperatures in the city are around 19 °C during wintertime and around 25 °C in the summer months. Precipitation in Santos is very high, amounting to around annually. Santos lies in one of the few isolated regions of Brazil outside of the tropical Amazon Basin that receive more than of total average precipitation annually, although nearby Ubatuba, approximately to the east-northeast, is considerably wetter than Santos, receiving an average of of precipitation annually. 

==Economy==
The Port of Santos is the biggest seaport in Latin America, which handled 96 million tons and 2.7 million TEUs in 2010. It has large industrial complexes and shipping centers, which handle a large portion of the world&#x27;s coffee exports, as well as a number of other Brazilian exports including steel, oil, cars, oranges, bananas and cotton.

As of 2014, the municipality of Santos was the 6th largest exporting city, by value, in Brazil by trading $4.36B (USD) worth of goods. The top four products exported from Santos were raw sugar (23% of total exports), refined petroleum (16%), coffee (15%), and soybeans (13%).

==Transportation==
===Airport and Air Force Base===
Santos Air Force Base - BAST, a base of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in the adjoining city of Guarujá.

The city will be served by Guarujá Civil Metropolitan Aerodrome, located in Guarujá.

===Rail===
Santos is served by the Baixada Santista Light Rail which connects the city to neighbouring São Vicente along a former rail line.

A heritage tram system operates along a touristic route in the Valango district, anchored by the historic Valango Station (). The station previously served as the terminus of the São Paulo Railway which connected Santos to São Paulo and Jundiaí, but ceased passenger operations by 1994. In the 21st century, the São Paulo state government has been exploring reinstating a regional rail network known as Trens Intercidades.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is the national measurement standards laboratory of the United Kingdom. It sets and maintains physical standards for British industry.

Founded in 1900, the NPL is one of the oldest metrology institutes in the world. Research and development work at the laboratory has contributed to the advancement of many disciplines of science, including the development of early computers in the late 1940s and 1950s, construction of the first accurate atomic clock in 1955, and the invention and first implementation of packet switching in the 1960s, which is today one of the fundamental technologies of the Internet. The former heads of NPL include many individuals who were pillars of the British scientific establishment.

NPL is based at Bushy Park in Teddington, west London. It is operated by NPL Management Ltd, a company owned by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and is one of the most extensive government laboratories in the United Kingdom.

==History==

=== Precursors ===
In the 19th century, the Kew Observatory was run by self-funded devotees of science. In the early 1850s, the observatory began charging fees for testing meteorological instruments and other scientific equipment. As universities in the United Kingdom created and expanded physics departments, the governing committee of the observatory became increasingly dominated by paid university physicists in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. By this time, instrument-testing was the observatory&#x27;s main role. Physicists sought the establishment of a state-funded scientific institution for testing electrical standards.

=== Founding ===
The National Physical Laboratory was established in 1900 at Bushy House in Teddington. Its purpose was &quot;for standardising and verifying instruments, for testing materials, and for the determination of physical constants&quot;. The laboratory was run by the UK government, with members of staff being part of the civil service. It grew to fill a large selection of buildings on the Teddington site.

=== Late 20th century ===
Administration of NPL was contracted out in 1995 under a Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) model, via a new operating company, NPL Management Ltd. Serco won the bid and all staff transferred to their employment. Under this regime, overhead costs halved, third-party revenues grew by 16% per annum, and the number of peer-reviewed research papers published doubled.

NPL procured a large state-of-the-art laboratory under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 1998. The construction was undertaken by John Laing.

=== 21st century ===
The new laboratory building, which had been maintained by Serco, was transferred back to the DTI in 2004 after the private sector companies involved made losses of over £100M.

It was decided in 2012 to change the operating model for NPL from 2014 onwards to include academic partners and to establish a postgraduate teaching institute on site. The date of the changeover was later postponed for a year. The candidates for lead academic partner were the Universities of Edinburgh, Southampton, Strathclyde and Surrey with an alliance of the Universities of Strathclyde and Surrey chosen as preferred partners.

Funding was announced in January 2013 for a new £25M Advanced Metrology Laboratory that will be built on the footprint of an existing unused building.

NPL Management Ltd and the operation of the laboratory transferred back to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (now the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology) on 1 January 2015.

==Notable researchers==

Researchers who have worked at NPL include: D. W. Dye who did important work in developing the technology of quartz clocks; the inventor Sir Barnes Wallis who did early development work on the &quot;Bouncing Bomb&quot; used in the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; wartime raids; H. J. Gough, one of the pioneers of research into metal fatigue, who worked at NPL for 19 years from 1914 to 1938; and Sydney Goldstein and Sir James Lighthill who worked in NPL&#x27;s aerodynamics division during World War II researching boundary layer theory and supersonic aerodynamics respectively.

Alan Turing, known for his work at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park during the Second World War to decipher German encrypted messages, worked at the National Physical Laboratory from 1945 to 1947. He designed there the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. Clifford Hodge also worked there and was engaged in research on semiconductors. Others who have spent time at NPL include Robert Watson-Watt, generally considered the inventor of radar, Oswald Kubaschewski, the father of computational materials thermodynamics and the numerical analyst James Wilkinson.

Metallurgist Walter Rosenhain appointed the NPL&#x27;s first female scientific staff members in 1915, Marie Laura Violet Gayler and Isabel Hadfield.

==Research==
NPL research has contributed to physical science, materials science, computing, and bioscience. Applications have been found in ship design, aircraft development, radar, computer networking, and global positioning.

===Atomic clocks===

The first accurate atomic clock, a caesium standard based on a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen and Jack Parry in 1955 at NPL. Calibration of the caesium standard atomic clock was carried out by the use of the astronomical time scale &quot;ephemeris time&quot; (ET). This led to the internationally agreed definition of the latest SI second being based on atomic time.

=== Computing ===
==== Early computers ====
NPL has undertaken computer research since the mid-1940s. From 1945, Alan Turing led the design of the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) computer. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing&#x27;s departure. Donald Davies took the project over and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious Pilot ACE computer, which first worked in May 1950. Among those who worked on the project was American computer pioneer Harry Huskey. A commercial spin-off, DEUCE was manufactured by English Electric Computers and became one of the best-selling machines of the 1950s.

====Packet switching====
Beginning in the mid-1960s, Donald Davies invented and pioneered the implementation of packet switching, now the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide. Davies designed and proposed a national commercial data network in his 1965 &quot;Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing&quot;. Subsequently, the NPL team, led by Roger Scantlebury, were the first to implement packet switching in the local-area NPL network in early 1969, which operated until 1986. They carried out work to analyse and simulate the performance of a wide-area packet-switched network capable of providing data communications facilities to most of the U.K. Their research and practice influenced the ARPANET in the United States, the forerunner of the Internet, and other researchers in the UK and Europe, including Louis Pouzin.

NPL sponsors a gallery, opened in 2009, about the development of packet switching and &quot;Technology of the Internet&quot; at The National Museum of Computing.

====Internetworking and Email====
NPL internetworking research was led by Davies, Barber and Scantlebury, who were members of the International Network Working Group (INWG). Connecting heterogeneous computer networks creates a &quot;basic dilemma&quot; since a common host protocol would require restructuring the existing networks. NPL connected with the European Informatics Network (Barber directed the project and Scantlebury led the UK technical contribution) by translating between two different host protocols; that is, using a gateway. Concurrently, the NPL connection to the Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service used a common host protocol in both networks. NPL research confirmed establishing a common host protocol would be more reliable and efficient. The EIN protocol helped to launch the proposed INWG standard. Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf acknowledged Davies and Scantlebury in their 1974 paper &quot;A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication&quot;.

Derek Barber proposed an electronic mail protocol in 1979 in INWG 192 and implemented it on the EIN. This was referenced by Jon Postel in his early work on Internet email, published in the Internet Experiment Note series.

====Scrapbook====
Scrapbook was an information storage and retrieval system that went live in mid-1971. It included what would now be called word processing, e-mail and hypertext, anticipating many elements of the World Wide Web. The project was managed by David Yates who said of it &quot;We had a community of bright people that were interested in new things, they were good fodder for a system like Scrapbook&quot; and &quot;When we had more than one Scrapbook system, hyperlinks could go across the network without the user knowing what was happening&quot;. It was decided that any commercial development of Scrapbook should be left to industry and it was licensed to Triad and then to BT who marketed it as Milepost and developed a transaction processor as an additional feature. Various implementations were marketed on DEC, IBM and ITL machines. All NPL implementations of Scrapbook were closed down in 1984.

==== Secure communication ====
In the early 1990s, the NPL developed three formal specifications of the MAA: one in Z, one in LOTOS, and one in VDM. The VDM specification became part of the 1992 revision of the International Standard 8731–2, and three implementations in C, Miranda, and Modula-2.

===Electromagnetics===

A 2020 study by researchers from Queen Mary University of London and NPL successfully used microwaves to measure blood-based molecules known to be influenced by dehydration.

=== Metrology ===
The National Physical Laboratory is involved with new developments in metrology, such as researching metrology for, and standardising, nanotechnology. It is mainly based at the Teddington site, but also has a site in Huddersfield for dimensional metrology and an underwater acoustics facility at Wraysbury Reservoir near Heathrow Airport.

<doc id="250392" wikidata="Q49964" url="?curid=250392" title="Council of Clermont">
<text>The Council of Clermont was a mixed synod of ecclesiastics and laymen of the Catholic Church, called by Pope Urban II and held from 17 to 27 November 1095 at Clermont, Auvergne, at the time part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. 

While the council is known today primarily for the speech Pope Urban gave on the final day, it was primarily a synod focused on implementing the Cluniac reforms, enacting decrees and settling local and regional issues. This also included the extension of the excommunication of Philip I of France for his adulterous remarriage to Bertrade of Montfort and a declaration of renewal of the Truce of God, an attempt on the part of the church to reduce feuding among Frankish nobles.

Pope Urban&#x27;s speech on 27 November included the call to arms that would result in the First Crusade, and eventually the capture of Jerusalem and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In this, Urban reacted to the request by Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus who had sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza requesting military assistance against the Seljuk Turks. Several accounts of the speech survive; of these, the one by Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the council, is generally accepted as the most reliable.

==Participants==
The council was attended by about 300 clerics. No official list of the participants or of the signatories to the decrees of the Council survives. A partial list of some of the attendees can nonetheless be constructed.

==Speech==
There are six main sources of information about this portion of the council:

#A letter that was written by Urban himself in December 1095 referring to the council;
#The anonymous &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of the Franks&quot; dated c. 1100/1101);
#Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the council, in his &quot;Gesta Francorum Iherusalem peregrinantium&quot; (c. 1100–1105); 
#Robert the Monk, who may have been present at the council, in &quot;Historia Hierosolymitana&quot; (1107); 
#Baldric, archbishop of Dol (written c. 1105);
#Guibert de Nogent, &quot;Dei gesta per Francos&quot; (1107/8).

The five versions of the speech vary widely in their details. The account by Fulcher, who is known to have been present at the council, is generally considered the most reliable version.

Urban&#x27;s own letter, written in December 1095 and addressed to the faithful &quot;waiting in Flanders,&quot; does lament that &quot;a barbaric fury has deplorably afflicted and laid waste the churches of God in the regions of the Orient&quot;. Urban does allude to Jerusalem, saying that this barbaric fury has &quot;even grasped in intolerable servitude its churches and the Holy City of Christ, glorified by His passion and resurrection&quot;. He calls upon the princes to &quot;free the churches of the East&quot;, appointing Adhemar of Le Puy as the leader of the expedition, to set out on the day of the Assumption of Mary (15 August 1096).

The &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; does not give an account of the speech at any length, it merely mentions that Urban called upon all to &quot;take up the way of the Lord&quot; and be prepared to suffer much, assured of their reward in heaven. It goes on to emphasize how news of Urban&#x27;s call to arms quickly spread by word of mouth &quot;through all the regions and countries of Gaul, the Franks, upon hearing such reports, forthwith caused crosses to be sewed on their right shoulders, saying that they followed with one accord the footsteps of Christ, by which they had been redeemed from the hand of hell.&quot;

===Fulcher===
Fulcher of Chartres was present at the speech, and recorded it in &quot;Gesta Francorum Jerusalem Expugnantium&quot;. He was writing from memory a few years later (c. 1100–1105). He asserts, in his prologue, that he is recording only such events as he had seen with his own eyes, and his record is phrased in a way consistent with the style of oration known from papal speeches in the 11th century.

In Fulcher&#x27;s text, Urban begins by reminding the clergy present that they are shepherds, and that they must be vigilant and avoid carelessness and corruption. He reminds them to refrain from simony and to adhere to the laws of the church. Urban complains about the lack of justice and public order in the Frankish provinces and calls for the re-establishment of the truce protecting clergy from violence. In the historiography of the Crusades, there is a long-standing argument as to how much the pacification of the Frankish realm was designed to go hand in hand with the &quot;export of violence&quot; to the enemy in the east. Fulcher reports that everyone present agreed to the pope&#x27;s propositions and promised to adhere to the church&#x27;s decrees. 

In the second portion of his speech, Urban urges the Frankish Christians that once they have re-established peace and righteousness in their own land, they should turn their attention to the East and bring aid to the Christians there, as the Turks had attacked them and had recently conquered the territory of &quot;Romania&quot; (i.e., Byzantine Anatolia) as far west as the Mediterranean, the part known as the &quot;Arm of Saint George&quot; (the Sea of Marmara), killing and capturing many Christians and destroying churches and devastating the kingdom of God. In order to avoid further loss of territory and even more widespread attacks on Christians, Urban calls on the clergy present to publish his call to arms everywhere, and persuade all people of whatever rank, both nobles and commoners, to go to the aid of the Christians currently under attack. Concluding his call to arms with &quot;Christ commands it&quot; (&quot;Christus autem imperat&quot;), Urban defines the crusade both as a defensive just war and as a religious holy war.

Urban goes on to promise immediate absolution to all who die either on the way or in battle against Muslims. He then connects his call to arms with his previous call for peace in Gaul: &quot;Let those who have been accustomed unjustly to wage private warfare against the faithful now go against the infidels and end with victory this war which should have been begun long ago. Let those who for a long time, have been robbers, now become knights. Let those who have been fighting against their brothers and relatives now fight in a proper way against the barbarians. Let those who have been serving as mercenaries for small pay now obtain the eternal reward. Let those who have been wearing themselves out in both body and soul now work for a double honor.&quot; The speech ends with Urban asking that all who plan to go rent their lands and raise money for their expenses as soon as possible, and that they leave when winter ends and spring begins.

===Robert===
Some historians prefer the version of the speech reported by Robert the Monk in his &quot;Historia Iherosolimitana&quot;, written in 1107. 
Robert gives a more vivid account, consisting both of a more elaborate sermon and the &quot;dramatic response&quot; of the audience, bursting into spontaneous cries of &quot;Deus vult&quot;.
In Robert&#x27;s version, Urban calls the &quot;race of the Franks&quot; to Christian orthodoxy, reform and submission to the Church and to come to the aid of the Greek Christians in the east. As in Fulcher&#x27;s account, Urban promises remission of sins for those who went to the east. 
Robert&#x27;s account of Urban&#x27;s speech has the rhetoric of a dramatic &quot;battle speech&quot;. Urban here emphasizes reconquering the Holy Land more than aiding the Greeks, an aspect lacking in Fulcher&#x27;s version and considered by many historians an insertion informed by the success of the First Crusade. Both Robert&#x27;s and Fulcher&#x27;s accounts of the speech include a description of the terrible plight of the Christians in the East under the recent conquests of the Turks and the promise of remission of sins for those who go to their aid. Robert&#x27;s version, however, includes a more vivid description of the atrocities committed by the conquerors, describing the desecration of churches, the forced circumcision, beheading and torture by disemboweling of Christian men and alluding to grievous rape of Christian women. Perhaps with the wisdom of hindsight, Robert makes Urban advise that none but knights should go, not the old and feeble, nor priests without the permission of their bishops, &quot;for such are more of a hindrance than aid, more of a burden than advantage... nor ought women to set out at all, without their husbands or brothers or legal guardians.&quot;

===Other versions===
About the same time, Baldric, archbishop of Dol, also basing his account generally on &quot;Gesta Francorum,&quot; reported an emotional sermon focusing on the offenses of the Muslims and the reconquest of the Holy Land in terms likely to appeal to chivalry. Like Fulcher he also recorded that Urban deplored the violence of the Christian knights of Gaul. &quot;It is less wicked to brandish your sword against Saracens,&quot; Baldric&#x27;s Urban cries, comparing them to the Amalekites. The violence of knights he wanted to see ennobled in the service of Christ, defending the churches of the East as if defending a mother. Baldric asserts that Urban, there on the spot, appointed the bishop of Puy to lead the crusade.

Guibert, abbot of Nogent in his &quot;Dei gesta per Francos&quot; (1107/8) also made that Urban emphasize the reconquest of the Holy Land more than help to the Greeks or other Christians there. This emphasis may, as in the case of Robert and Baldric, be due to the influence account of the reconquest of Jerusalem in the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;. Urban&#x27;s speech in Guibert&#x27;s version, emphasizes the sanctity of the Holy Land, which must be in Christian possession so that prophecies about the end of the world could be fulfilled.

<doc id="250396" wikidata="Q5151417" url="?curid=250396" title="ComedySportz">
<text>ComedySportz (CSz) is an improvisational comedy organization started in 1984 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by a group of local comedians including Dick Chudnow, Bob Orvis, Brian Green, and others.

==Match format==
The traditional format of a ComedySportz match features two teams of improvisational performers (&quot;Players&quot;), competing in various rounds, using improv games and performing scenes. Audience members judge the results and award points as directed by the Referee. In every match, a ComedySportz referee monitors the action, awarding points, and administering Fouls as necessary. The flavor is somewhat like the television show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, though the ComedySportz organization precedes that show&#x27;s debut by 4 years. The CSz format is a more competitive and For Everyone (content-wise) version of the Theatresports format, which preceded ComedySportz by 7 years.

ComedySportz penalties (put in place for the audience&#x27;s benefit) include:
* Out of Bounds Foul: called when a player uses explicit language or refers to something crass or off-color. If the Out of Bounds Foul is called, the offending player or audience member must spend the remainder of the game outside the theater space. They may or may not be welcomed back in. &quot;(Originally called the &quot;Brown Bag Foul&quot;, the player would have a brown paper bag placed on their head for the rest of the round but replaced by the &quot;Out of Bounds Foul&quot; due to COVID-19 in 2022.)&quot;
* Groaner Foul: whereby any player who speaks a pun bad enough to make the audience groan causing their team to lose one point (or awarding the other team with a point), unless their apology to the audience is heartfelt enough and accepted.
:Example: &quot;Why does the Norwegian navy put barcodes on ships? So they can Scandenavian&quot;
* Any spontaneously generated Foul the referee feels is needed to move the match forward.

Although the image of competition is maintained, the teams are often dynamic, with rosters depending on which player (many of whom have other occupations ) are available for a match at any given time, and match outcomes are not pre-determined as audience voting/selected judges decide the winner.

==Organization==

CSz Worldwide and ComedySportz are licensed by the &quot;World Comedy League Incorporated.&quot; There are over 28 cities with licensed ComedySportz organizations, most in the United States. In recent years, ComedySportz has been licensed in Manchester, England (although this team originated in Chorley, Lancashire) and Berlin, Germany.

Most ComedySportz cities operate their own &quot;arenas,&quot; some with theatre type settings, others as nightclubs. Few (including ComedySportz Milwaukee) have their very own bar and restaurant. Sometimes the members of the comedic improv team also work sound and lights. The clean content and audience focused nature of the ComedySportz match allows CSz groups to perform thousands of road shows for corporate, college, church, school, and association clients each year; most CSz groups also lead corporate team-building workshops. In addition, players from some cities coach ComedySportz high school and middle school leagues, in which students perform in shows similar to those seen at the &quot;professional&quot; level.

==World Championship==
Teams meet annually at the ComedySportz World Championship for a competitive tournament, training, and exchange of artistic, marketing, and organizational ideas. The location of the tournament rotates among the member cities. The first world championship that Milwaukee won was in 1988. The banner hangs in the Milwaukee stadium. The first World Championship in Milwaukee&#x27;s new arena was August 4–7, 2004, also served as the Grand Opening for Milwaukee&#x27;s all-new ComedySportz Arena at 420 South 1st Street in Milwaukee. In 2009, the World Championship returned to Milwaukee for the 25th anniversary celebration, and returned again in 2014 to celebrate both its 30th anniversary and rebranding of the logo.

Prior to 2004, this mostly annual event was billed as the &quot;ComedySportz National Tournament.&quot;

In 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic the championships were held online. Portland defeated Jersey Shore in the 2021 Championship match.

<text>The Search for Odin (Norwegian: &quot;Jakten på Odin&quot;) is the project title of Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s last series of archaeological excavations, which took place in (Tanais) in Russia.

== Theoretical background ==
Heyerdahl&#x27;s intention was to prove the veracity of the account of Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga, written in the 13th century, about the origin of the Norse royal dynasties, and the pre-Christian Norse gods. Snorri provides a euhemeristic account, in which he describes the Norse god Odin and some other Norse gods, the Æsir, as having been real people who emigrated from the area around the river Don to Scandinavia at the time of the Roman expansion into their old homeland. In Scandinavia, Snorri writes, they so impressed the native population that they started worshipping them as gods.

Heyerdahl tried to seek the origins of the Æsir, following the route set out by Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga, from the Black Sea and the river Tanais (referred to by Snorri Sturluson by the names &quot;Tanaís&quot; and &quot;Tanakvísl&quot;) via Saxon homelands in northern Germany, Odense on Fyn, Denmark to Old Sigtuna, ancient Sweden. When Heyerdahl died in 2002 the second season of excavations had just been finished.

== Critique ==
Heyerdahl&#x27;s Odin project was subjected to fierce criticism from Norwegian academics within the fields of research upon which the theory touches. Both the first book detailing the Odin project, &quot;Ingen grenser&quot; from 1999, and the second book, &quot;Jakten på Odin&quot; from 2001, were met with a forceful and detailed response from leading academics in which the reasons were laid out to the wider public as to why Heyerdahl&#x27;s theory in their view was false. After the last book the attacks against Heyerdahl were also worded in a way that was seen by many as disrespectful. The five leading academics responsible for the reviews explained that although popular literature would not normally be subject to such scrutiny, they felt it was necessary in this case, partly because Heyerdahl himself laid claim to academic credentials and partly due to his popularity.

The reviewers, speaking on behalf of the academic community of Norway, categorize Heyerdahl&#x27;s theory as an example of pseudoarchaeology, based on a selective reading of sources, and a lack of understanding, or a lack of willingness to use basic scientific methodology. Much of the foundation of his theory, they point out, is based on similarities between names of figures from Norse mythology and geographical place-names of the present time in the Pontic steppe and Caucasus. Comparison of these names is done with disregard of linguistic theory, according to the reviewers.

Azov is believed by Heyerdahl to have derived its name from &quot;as-hof&quot; – &quot;temple of the Æsir&quot;. Mainstream linguists and historians will say that the city of Azov got its name from the Turks, over 1000 years after Heyerdahl believes the Æsir lived there. Heyerdahl also points to the similarities between the word Æsir and the Azeri and Ossetian peoples of the Caucasus, between the god Odin and the Caucasian language group Udi and between the god Tyr and Turkey, and between the Vanir (a group of Norse gods) and the word &quot;Vannic&quot;, which was for a time in the 19th and 20th centuries the name used for the Urartian language, spoken in ancient times in the area around Lake Van.

<doc id="250405" wikidata="Q265898" url="?curid=250405" title="Consuelo Vanderbilt">
<text>Consuelo Vanderbilt-Balsan (formerly Consuelo Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough; born Consuelo Vanderbilt; 2 March 1877 – 6 December 1964) was an American socialite and member of the Vanderbilt family. Her first marriage to the 9th Duke of Marlborough has become a well-known example of the advantageous, but loveless marriages common during the Gilded Age. The Duke obtained a large dowry through the marriage and reportedly told her just after the wedding that he married her in order to &quot;save Blenheim Palace&quot;, his ancestral home.

Although the young Consuelo was opposed to the marriage arranged by her mother, she became a popular and influential duchess. For much of their 25-year marriage, the Marlboroughs lived separately; after an official separation in 1906, the couple was divorced in 1921, followed by an annulment in 1926. Her first marriage produced two sons, John (the 10th Duke) and Ivor. She went on to marry the wealthy French aviator Jacques Balsan and continued her charitable endeavours. Consuelo and Balsan lived in France just prior to World War II, then moved to the United States. As stipulated in her will, she was buried near her younger son, Lord Ivor, at St Martin&#x27;s Church, the parish church for Blenheim Palace.

== Early life ==
Born in New York City, Consuelo was the only daughter and eldest child of William Kissam Vanderbilt, a New York railroad millionaire, and his first wife, Alva Erskine Smith, a Southern belle, budding suffragist, and daughter of Murray Forbes Smith. Consuelo&#x27;s Spanish name was in honor of her godmother, Consuelo Yznaga, a half-Cuban, half-American socialite who had created a social stir in 1876 when she married the fortune-hunting George Montagu, Viscount Mandeville (later 8th Duke of Manchester), a union of Old World aristocracy and New World money.

Consuelo was largely dominated by her mother, who was determined that her daughter would make a great match like that of her famous namesake. In her autobiography, Consuelo described how she was required to wear a steel rod, which ran down her spine and fastened around her waist and over her shoulders, to improve her posture. She was educated entirely at home by governesses and tutors, and learned foreign languages at an early age. Her mother whipped her with a riding crop for minor infractions, and when, as a teenager, Consuelo objected to the clothing her mother had selected for her, Alva told her that &quot;&quot;I&quot; do the thinking, you do as you are told.&quot;
Like her godmother, Consuelo attracted numerous title-bearing suitors anxious to trade social position for cash. Her mother reportedly received at least five proposals for her hand. Consuelo was allowed to consider the proposal of just one of the men, Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg, but she developed an instant aversion to him. None of the others, however, was good enough for Alva, herself the daughter of a cotton broker.

Consuelo was considered a great beauty, with a face compelling enough to cause the playwright Sir James Barrie, author of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, to write, &quot;I would stand all day in the street to see Consuelo Marlborough get into her carriage.&quot; Oxford undergraduate Guy Fortescue later described how he and his friends were captivated by her &quot;&quot;piquante&quot; oval face perched upon a long slender neck, her enormous dark eyes fringed with curling lashes, her dimples, and her tiny teeth when she smiled.&quot; She came to embody the &quot;slim, tight look&quot; that was in vogue during the Edwardian era.

== First marriage ==

Determined to secure the highest-ranking mate possible for her only daughter, a union that would emphasize the preeminence of the Vanderbilt family, Alva engineered a meeting between Consuelo and the indebted, titled Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, chatelain of Blenheim Palace. The matchmaker was Lady Paget, the wife of Sir Arthur Paget. Born as Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Stevens, Lady Paget was the daughter of Marietta Reed Stevens, the socially ambitious widow of American hotel entrepreneur Paran Stevens, who had successfully obtained admittance to the exclusive New York society of the fabled &quot;Four Hundred.&quot; Lady Paget, always short of money, became a sort of international marital agent, introducing eligible American heiresses to British noblemen.

Consuelo had no interest in the Duke, being secretly engaged to Winthrop Rutherfurd, an American socialite 15 years her senior. Her mother begged, and then ultimately ordered her daughter to marry the Duke. When Consuelo — a docile teenager known only for her obedience to her fearsome mother — made plans to elope, she was locked in her room as Alva threatened to murder Rutherfurd. Consuelo refused until it was claimed that Alva&#x27;s health was being undermined by Consuelo&#x27;s stubbornness, and she appeared to be at death&#x27;s door. Alva made an astonishing recovery from her supposed illness, and when the wedding took place, Consuelo stood at the altar reportedly weeping behind her veil. The Duke, for his part, allegedly gave up the woman he loved back in England and collected $2,500,000 ($91,600,000 in dollars) in railroad stock as a marriage settlement.
Consuelo married the Duke at Saint Thomas Church in New York, on 6 November 1895. They had two sons, John Albert Edward William Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford (later 10th Duke of Marlborough and a godson of the future King Edward VII) in 1897, and Lord Ivor Charles Spencer-Churchill in 1898.

The new Duchess was adored by the poor and less fortunate tenants on her husband&#x27;s estate, whom she visited and to whom she provided assistance. She later became involved with other philanthropic projects and was particularly interested in those that affected mothers and children. She was also a social success with the royalty and aristocracy of Britain.

Unlike her husband, Consuelo was considered to be politically liberal and quite progressive for a Duchess, with Consuelo advocating for social reforms and endorsing the Liberal Party&#x27;s welfare agenda, such as free school meals, free medical inspection for children, national insurance for workers, and old-age pensions. She was also an advocate for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, seeing it as a means to remedy social welfare problems — though she condemned militant tactics in stark contrast with her more radical mother. In 1913, she became chairwoman of the Women&#x27;s Municipal Party to promote greater female participation in municipal elections.

Given the ill-fitting match between the Duke and his wife, it was only a matter of time before their marriage was in name only. A few years into their marriage, Consuelo reconnected with Winthrop Rutherfurd and went on to spend two weeks in Paris with him. Soon after, she confessed to her husband that she loved Rutherfurd and wished to elope with him (the Duke&#x27;s second wife, Gladys, later implied that Consuelo&#x27;s second son was Rutherfurd&#x27;s). In 1900, with the Duke&#x27;s reluctant permission, she went to London to discuss the elopement with Rutherfurd, only for him to refuse her. In despair, the Duke set off for South Africa, where his cousin, Winston Churchill, was serving in the Second Boer War. He was away for six months, returning in July 1900. Upon his return, Consuelo confessed to having an affair with his cousin, Reginald Fellowes. She may also have had an affair with the artist Paul César Helleu, who portrayed her several times in his sketches and pastel artwork. The artist&#x27;s daughter believed that Helleu and Consuelo probably had an affair between 1900 and 1901, which continued after his return to Paris, where she visited him and sat for him again. By this time the Duke and Duchess had completely stopped being intimate, and soon the Duke fell for Gladys Deacon, an eccentric American of little money but, like Consuelo, dazzling to look at and of considerable intellect. After Consuelo&#x27;s affair and planned elopement with the married Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry, the Marlboroughs separated in 1906 and divorced in 1921. The marriage was annulled, at the Duke&#x27;s request and with Consuelo&#x27;s assent, on 19 August 1926.

Though largely embarked upon as a way to facilitate the Anglican Duke&#x27;s desire to convert to Roman Catholicism, the annulment, to the surprise of many, was also fully supported by Consuelo&#x27;s mother, who testified that the Vanderbilt-Marlborough marriage had been an act of unmistakable coercion. &quot;I forced my daughter to marry the Duke,&quot; Alva told an investigator, adding, &quot;I have always had absolute power over my daughter.&quot; In later years, Consuelo and her mother enjoyed a closer, easier relationship.

== Marriage settlement and personal fortune ==
As one of the wealthiest and most well-known &quot;dollar princesses&quot; of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the financial settlement at the center of the union of Consuelo Vanderbilt and the 9th Duke of Marlborough continues to attract commentary and reference more than a century after the wedding took place.

The marriage settlement provided for the Duke to receive a $2,500,000 trust that would pay $100,000 per year. Consuelo also received a further $100,000 per year. The combined annual income of $200,000 (£40,000) more than doubled the income the Duke had enjoyed from his estates prior to the marriage. Consuelo and the Duke also acquired several large gifts from her father, William K. Vanderbilt, including a palatial London townhouse and a reported sum of $1,000,000 in cash to mark the Duke&#x27;s safe return from South Africa. Documents quoted in newspaper articles in 1926 also confirm that additional Trusts of $5,000,000 in 1912 and $450,000 in 1912 were created by Consuelo&#x27;s father for the benefit of Consuelo and her children, but not the Duke. Consuelo also received a 1/3 share of a $5,000,000 Trust created by her grandfather&#x27;s Will for her father&#x27;s benefit. Consequently, the total amount given to Consuelo, her first husband and children during her father&#x27;s lifetime and under the terms of his Will was approximately $17,000,000.

The Duke received 50,000 shares of Beech Creek Railroad stock, valued at $2,500,000, which was to be placed in trust, with a guaranteed income of at least 4% ($100,000 or £20,000) per year to be paid to the Duke for his lifetime, and then to Consuelo if she survived him. Following the deaths of both Consuelo and the Duke, the income from the trust would be paid to the next duke of Marlborough, provided that he was a descendant of the 9th Duke. In the event of Consuelo and the Duke not being survived by a son or male-line descendant, the trust would vest in their other descendants, which the Duke had the power to appoint by deed or will.

A 1944 court ruling in the Chancery Division of the English High Court of Justice held that death duties on this trust had become payable by Consuelo&#x27;s son, the 10th Duke of Marlborough, upon the death of the 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1934, despite the fact that the income was still being paid to Consuelo for the remainder of her lifetime. The duties, with interest added for the period between the 9th Duke&#x27;s death and 12 April 1946 were paid in 1946, and amounted to approximately £175,000.
;Consuelo&#x27;s trust
Part of the marriage settlement took the form of a covenant made by William K. Vanderbilt to pay Consuelo $100,000 annually for their joint lifetimes; this provided for the payment of $2,500,000 within a year of his death to Consuelo&#x27;s trustees, with the income to be derived by her for the remainder of her lifetime. If she predeceased the 9th Duke, the income was to be paid to him for his life, and following both of their deaths, the trust would vest in the couple&#x27;s children, unless Consuelo made an alternative appointment in her will.

Following William K. Vanderbilt&#x27;s death in 1920, the $2,500,000 were treated as a debt against his estate that was duly transferred to Consuelo&#x27;s trustees.

;Residence
In the early years of their marriage, it was rumoured that enquiries were made by Consuelo&#x27;s father and husband as to whether the ancestral London townhouse of the Dukes of Marlborough, Marlborough House, could be recovered from the Crown Estate. Once it had become apparent that this could not be achieved, William K. Vanderbilt paid $380,000 for a parcel of land on Curzon Street where a large townhouse, Sunderland House (earl of Sunderland, a subsidiary title of the duke of Marlborough, was used as a courtesy by the 9th Duke prior to his grandfather&#x27;s death and resulted in his nickname &quot;Sunny&quot;), was to be built for his daughter and son-in-law. A further $500,000 was reportedly spent on the construction, and more than $1,000,000 on fitting out and furnishing the new building. The total cost of the mansion was later reported as being in excess of $2,500,000.

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Consuelo accepted the British Government&#x27;s request to borrow the house for the use of the Interallied War Council. Sunderland House was sold by the Marlboroughs in 1919.

;Father&#x27;s estate and inheritance
In the months prior to and following the death of Consuelo&#x27;s father in August 1920, it was rumoured that he had gifted her $15,000,000. The speculation was serious enough to result in a representative of the New York State Tax Office being quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as stating that litigation could arise as to whether the gift would be subject to more than $500,000 in inheritance taxes. In 1926, copies of documents relating to negotiations between Consuelo&#x27;s father and the 9th Duke of Marlborough prior to their marriage were located in the New York Surrogate&#x27;s Court. These documents included a letter dated 15 December 1919; transcriptions of the letter published in 1926 note that Consuelo&#x27;s father had created an additional $5,000,000 Trust fund consisting of New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company 3.5% Lake Shore collateral trust Bonds in 1912, which provided a life interest to Consuelo only, and thereafter to her sons; a further $450,000 of 1917 3.5% Liberty Bonds were conveyed to Consuelo&#x27;s brothers in 1919 with the express provision that they be held in Trust for Consuelo but should not form part of her Marriage Settlement. These documents confirmed that the Trusts created for Consuelo by her father included $2,500,000 in 1895, $5,000,000 in 1912, $450,000 in 1919, and a 1/3 share of the $5,000,000 Trust provided in Consuelo&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s Will for her father.

Besides the $2,500,000 that William K. Vanderbilt had pledged to transfer to Consuelo&#x27;s trustees after his death and which formed part of her marriage settlement, his will provided for a further $2,500,000 to be placed in trust for Consuelo&#x27;s benefit, with her brothers, William K. Vanderbilt, Jr. and Harold S. Vanderbilt, as trustees. Following her death, the principal of this additional $2,500,000 trust was to be paid to her children. Her two sons also received $1,000,000 each.

In addition, Consuelo benefited from $1,670,000 derived from a trust established by her grandfather, William H. Vanderbilt. Following his death in 1885, each of his eight children received a $5,000,000 trust from his estate. The Anderson and Anderson report in August 1920 noted that the will of William K. Vanderbilt did not make any provisions as to the distribution of this trust, and as a result the principal vested in equal shares between Consuelo and her two brothers.

Consuelo also received a reversionary interest in her father&#x27;s French properties at 10 &amp; 11 Rue Leroux, Paris and a château in Normandy, in which her stepmother had a life-interest.

;1964 - Will and Estate
Following Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan&#x27;s death in 1964, her Will was submitted to the Suffolk County Surrogate&#x27;s Court in the State of New York. Newspaper reports of the filing and grant of probate noted that the Trust which formed part of Consuelo&#x27;s marriage settlement (originally worth $2,500,000) was to be split into 25 shares; the majority were bequeathed to her granddaughter Lady Sarah Russell who received 15 shares. The remaining shares were left to three other grandchildren - four shares each to Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill and Lady Caroline Waterhouse, and two shares to Rosemary Muir. In January 1965 Lady Sarah Russell made a public statement which denied an inheritance running into the millions, stating that her late grandmother &quot;did not have millions&quot;, but conceding that she had inherited a house on Long Island worth $250,000.

Other bequests included £14,200 to Consuelo&#x27;s butler, Louis Hoffmann, an estate in Palm Beach to Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, £10,700 and an Ingres Painting to Lady Ivor Spencer-Churchill, and bequests to five other staff members in Consuelo&#x27;s household ranging from £1,070 to £5,350. A provision in the Will also noted that no bequest had been made to her son, the 10th Duke of Marlborough, due to the ample provision already made for him under Trusts settled by Consuelo&#x27;s father. A spokesperson for her family reportedly disclosed that the approximate value of Consuelo&#x27;s personal estate was $1,000,000.

== Second marriage and later life ==

Consuelo&#x27;s second wedding, on 4 July 1921, was to Lt. Col. Jacques Balsan, a record-breaking pioneer French balloon, aircraft, and hydroplane pilot who once worked with the Wright Brothers. Also a textile manufacturing heir, Balsan was the younger brother of Étienne Balsan, an early lover of Coco Chanel. Their marriage lasted until Balsan&#x27;s death in 1956 at the age of 88.

After the end of her first marriage, Consuelo still maintained ties with favorite Churchill relatives, particularly Winston Churchill. He was a frequent visitor at her château in Saint-Georges-Motel, a small commune near Dreux about 50 miles from Paris, in the 1920s and 1930s.

Records in Florida show that in 1932 Consuelo built a house in Manalapan, just south of Palm Beach. The 26,000 square feet mansion was designed by Maurice Fatio and named &quot;Casa Alva&quot; in honor of her mother; the property was sold in 1957. Many believe that, in 1946, Churchill polished his famous Iron Curtain speech here, as he visited Consuelo on his way to Missouri to deliver the address at Westminster College.

As Consuelo Vanderbilt-Balsan, she published her insightful but not entirely candid autobiography, &quot;The Glitter and the Gold&quot;, in 1953. In spite of suggestions that it was ghostwritten by Stuart Preston, an American writer who was an art critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Preston consistently denied that role while admitting to unspecified involvement with the book. A reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;an ideal epitaph of the age of elegance.&quot;

Consuelo died in Southampton, Long Island, New York, on 6 December 1964. She was buried near her younger son, Lord Ivor, in the churchyard at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, not far from her former home, Blenheim Palace. Her estate was estimated to be not in excess of $2,000,000, with the majority of her income being derived from trusts which would devolve upon her sons after her death. The primary beneficiary of her personal estate, including her residence in Southampton and her jewels, was her eldest granddaughter, Lady Sarah.

== Public service ==
During World War I, Consuelo worked as the chair of the Economic Relief Committee for the American Women&#x27;s War Relief Fund.

In 1917, Consuelo became a councillor on the London County Council for Southwark West (later: Southwark North) after a vacancy opened. Although she had no desire to enter politics, she felt a strong sense of obligation after the Women&#x27;s Municipal Party asked her to take up the vacant seat. She stood as the candidate for the Progressive Party along with Albert Wilson, winning re-election in 1919 and holding onto the seat until her divorce with the duke.

During the interwar period, she and Winaretta Singer-Polignac (the Princess de Polignac and Singer Sewing Machine heiress) worked together in the construction of a 360-bed hospital destined to provide medical care to middle class workers. The result of this effort is the Foch Hospital, located in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris. The hospital also includes a school of nursing and is one of the top ranked hospitals in France, especially for renal transplants. It has remained true to its origins and stayed a private not-for-profit institution that still serves the Paris community. It is managed by the Fondation Médicale Franco-Américaine du Mont-Valérien, commonly known as Foch Foundation.

<text>Jean Antoine Zinnen (25 April 1827 – 16 May 1898) was a Luxembourgish composer, best known for the Luxembourgish national anthem, &quot;Ons Heemecht&quot;.

==Career==

Zinnen was born in Neuerburg, in the Prussian Rhineland, close to the border with Luxembourg. When he was six, his family moved to Luxembourg. After serving as a musician in the army, he naturalised as a Luxembourgish citizen in 1849. In 1851, he became the first director of the Diekirch choral society &quot;Sangerbond&quot;. In 1852, he was appointed Luxembourg City&#x27;s director of music, and, soon after, director of the city conservatoire. In 1863, he was appointed the director of the newly founded &quot;Allgemeiner Luxemburger Musikverein&quot; (ALM) which, in 1947, was renamed &quot;Union Grand-Duc Adolphe&quot;, the national umbrella organisation for music societies, bands, choirs and orchestras.

==&quot;Ons Hémecht&quot;==

The following year, at the first celebration of the ALM in Ettlebrück, &quot;Ons Hémecht&quot; was sung by a choir. Michel Lentz, the national poet who was a member of the ALM&#x27;s central committee, had written the words, wishing to convey a powerful feeling of patriotism. Zinnen set the poem to music, later transforming it into a solemn hymn. On 25 June 1865, on the occasion of a music festival in Vianden, &quot;Ons Hémecht&quot; was performed for the first time with an instrumental accompaniment. &quot;Ons Heemecht&quot; was adopted as Luxembourg&#x27;s national anthem in 1895.

Jean-Antoine Zinnen died in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, at the age of 71, and was buried in Limpertsberg, Luxembourg City. Two years after his death, a monument was constructed at the churchyard in which he is buried, paid for by private donations.

<text>God &amp; Golem, Inc.: A Comment on Certain Points Where Cybernetics Impinges on Religion is a book written by MIT cybernetician Norbert Wiener. It won the second annual U.S. National Book Award in category Science, Philosophy and Religion.

It is based on material from a series of lectures that Wiener gave at Yale in 1962, and a seminar he led at the Colloques Philosophiques Internationaux de Royaumont near Paris later that year.

&quot;God and Golem&quot; presents Wiener&#x27;s ideas on machine learning, machine reproduction, and the place of machines in society, with some religious context.

Wiener mentions some of his secondary concerns: sensory feedback in artificial limbs, the problems of human responsibility in relation with technology, the limits of machine game-playing, Darwinism, Marxism, the Cold War, the rigidity of ideological thinking, and a critique of the claims of econometrics and mathematical economics to be regarded as being scientific.

In the conclusion, he brings the burden of ethics to politics, away from religion.

Statements in the book are quoted in the science-fiction novels &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;, written by Dan Simmons.

<doc id="250415" wikidata="Q374776" url="?curid=250415" title="Warded lock">
<text>A warded lock (also called a ward lock) is a type of lock that uses a set of obstructions, or &quot;wards&quot;, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The correct key has notches or slots corresponding to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock.

== History ==

The warded lock is one of the oldest lock designs, found as far back as ancient China and Rome. During the Middle Ages they were used prolifically on monasteries where, because money and time were available, their complexity grew. Warded locks are still in use today in the UK and Ireland for low-security applications, and on heritage sites such as ancient monuments and churches to preserve original features, with primary security being provided by other means such as a lever lock mechanism installed in addition.

== Design ==
In a basic warded lock, a set of obstructions, often consisting of concentric plates protruding outwards, blocks the rotation of a key not designed for that lock. Warded locks may have one simple ward, or many intricate wards with bends and complex protrusions; the principle remains the same. Unless the notches or slots in the key correspond to the wards in the lock, the key will strike an obstruction and will not turn.

Additionally, a series of grooves on either side of the key&#x27;s blade may limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock through the keyway, the wards align with the grooves in the key&#x27;s profile to allow or deny entry into the lock cylinder. Although this is not commonly recognized when discussing warded locks, it is more applicable to current locksmithing applications such as pin-tumbler or wafer-tumbler locks.

In double-sided locksets (meaning locksets where the key can be inserted from either side of the door) the centre of the key shaft is solid and protrudes past the end of the bit, which slots into a hole on the opposite side of the lock. Double-sided ward locks nearly always have perfectly symmetrical bits. For single-sided locks, a cylindrical post is typically located in the center of the lock. Its purpose is to provide a point of leverage and pivot for rotating the key, and to help correctly align the key with the wards. The key has a corresponding hole which fits over the post.

When the correct key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, activating a latch or sliding bolt, or it may itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double acting lever lock, the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.

== Vulnerabilities ==
Due to the design of the lock, a well-designed skeleton key can be made to bypass the wards. For this reason, warded lock-mechanisms are generally used in low-security applications. There are also a very limited number of unique keys that can be created, so many keys will be able to open other doors that they were not designed to open.

The invention of the lever tumbler lock solves this problem, as each lever is required to be lifted to a certain height in order to operate the locking mechanism.

<doc id="250420" wikidata="Q703899" url="?curid=250420" title="Bielefeld conspiracy">
<text>The Bielefeld conspiracy (German: or , ) is a satirical conspiracy theory that claims that the city of Bielefeld, Germany, does not exist, and is instead an illusion propagated by various forces to distract or mislead the German public. First posted on the German Usenet in 1994, the conspiracy has since been mentioned in the city&#x27;s marketing, and alluded to in a speech by former Chancellor Angela Merkel.

==Synopsis==
The theory proposes that the city of Bielefeld (population of 341,755 ) in the German state of North-Rhine-Westphalia does not actually exist. Rather, its existence is merely propagated by an entity known only as (German for &quot;THEY&quot;), which has conspired with the authorities to create the illusion of the city&#x27;s existence.

The theory is based on three questions:
# Do you know anybody from &quot;Bielefeld&quot;?
# Have you ever been to &quot;Bielefeld&quot;?
# Do you know anybody who has ever been to &quot;Bielefeld&quot;?
A majority are expected to answer &quot;no&quot; to all three queries. Anybody who can answer &quot;yes&quot; to any of the queries, or claim any other knowledge about &quot;Bielefeld&quot;, is promptly disregarded as being in on the conspiracy, or having been themselves deceived.

The origins of and reasons for this conspiracy are not a part of the original theory. Speculated originators jokingly include the Central Intelligence Agency, Mossad, or aliens who use Bielefeld University as a disguise for their spaceship.

==History==

The conspiracy theory was first made public in a posting to the newsgroup codice_1 on 16 May 1994 by Achim Held, a computer science student at the University of Kiel. When a friend of Held met someone from Bielefeld at a student party in 1993, he said &quot;&quot;. This statement has a double-meaning: &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; and &quot;That doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;. The second meaning spread throughout the German-speaking Internet community.

In a television interview conducted for the 10th anniversary of the newsgroup posting, Held stated that this myth definitely originated from his Usenet posting, which was intended only as a joke. According to Held, the idea for the conspiracy theory formed in his mind at a student party while speaking to an avid reader of New Age magazines, and from a car journey past Bielefeld at a time when the exit from the to it was closed.

Historian Alan Lessoff notes that a reason for the amusement value of the theory is Bielefeld&#x27;s lack of notable features, as being home to no major institutions or tourist attractions and not being on the course of a major river: &quot;&#x27;Bielefeld&#x27; defines nondescript.&quot;

==Public reception==
The Bielefeld conspiracy remains one of the most popular Internet jokes originating in Germany.

In November 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel referred to the conspiracy in public when talking about a town hall meeting she had attended in Bielefeld, adding: &quot;... if it exists at all&quot;, and &quot;I had the impression that I was there&quot;.

===Official response===
The city council of Bielefeld made efforts to generate publicity for Bielefeld and build a nationally known public image of the city. However, even ten years after the conspiracy started, the mayor&#x27;s office still received phone calls and e-mails which claimed to doubt the existence of the city.

On April Fools&#x27; Day in 1999, five years after the myth started to spread, the city council released a press statement titled &quot;&quot; (Bielefeld &quot;does&quot; exist!). In allusion to the origin of the conspiracy, the 800th anniversary of Bielefeld was held in 2014 under the motto (&quot;Unbelievable!&quot;, literally &quot;That doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;).

In August 2019, the council offered to give €1 million to any person who could provide &quot;incontrovertible evidence&quot; of Bielefeld&#x27;s nonexistence in an effort to increase interest in the city. As no-one was able to prove Bielefeld&#x27;s non-existence, the city therefore sees its existence as conclusive and the conspiracy as ended. To commemorate it, the city erected a glacial erratic block in the historic center near the Leineweber monument. A QR code on it directs to further background information.

==Film==
In 2009, film students at Bielefeld University started a project to develop a feature film based on the Bielefeld conspiracy. The project was financed by the university and local sponsors. Most of the project&#x27;s staff and actors were students or university employees, a few professionals, such as the actress Julia Kahl and cameraman Alexander Böke, joined the project. The screenplay was written by Thomas Walden. The film premiered in Bielefeld on 2 June 2010.

<doc id="250423" wikidata="Q681006" url="?curid=250423" title="Emerson String Quartet">
<text>The Emerson String Quartet, also known as the Emerson Quartet, was an American string quartet initially formed as a student group at the Juilliard School in 1976. It was named for American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and began touring professionally in 1976. The ensemble taught in residence at The Hartt School in the 1980s and is currently the quartet in residence at Stony Brook University. Both of the founding violinists studied with Oscar Shumsky at Juilliard, and the two alternated as first and second violinists for the group. The Emerson Quartet was one of the first such ensembles with the two violinists alternating chairs.

The Emerson Quartet was inducted into the Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2010. , they had released more than thirty albums and won nine Grammy Awards, as well as the prestigious Avery Fisher Prize in 2004. In 2017, the Emerson String Quartet Institute became part of the College of Arts and Sciences at Stony Brook University. The institute enables members of the current quartet and the quartet&#x27;s former cellist David Finckel to mentor and coach student string quartets.

In August 2021, the quartet announced its plan to disband at the end of the 2022–2023 season in order to focus on teaching and solo work. In the final season of concerts in 2022-23, the quartet gave farewell performances throughout North America and Europe. The final performance of the quartet took place on Sunday, October 22, 2023, in New York City, featuring a program of Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 130 string quartet (with its original ending, the Grosse Fuge, Op. 133) and Schubert&#x27;s string quintet D. 956. The performance was filmed by Tristan Cook for a planned documentary.

==Members==
The members of the group at the time of its retirement were: Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, violin; Lawrence Dutton, viola (since 1977); and Paul Watkins, cello (since 2013).

Previous members were: Guillermo Figueroa, Jr., viola (1976–1977); Eric Wilson, cello (1976–1979); and David Finckel, cello (1979–2013).

==History==
In the early 1980s, Deutsche Grammophon chose the Emerson Quartet to begin a series of recordings of the string quartet literature to be released on the new CD digital format. Cellist David Finckel called this a &quot;huge break&quot; for the ensemble, allowing it to develop a worldwide audience for its performances.

In addition to using their Stradivarius instruments, the Emerson quartet own instruments by Samuel Zygmuntowicz which they often favour in larger halls as they believe they have better projection. Violinist Eugene Drucker even says of his modern violin &quot;In a large space like Carnegie Hall, the Zygmuntowicz is superior to my Strad. It has more power and punch.&quot;

<text>In algebra, ring theory is the study of rings, algebraic structures in which addition and multiplication are defined and have similar properties to those operations defined for the integers. Ring theory studies the structure of rings; their representations, or, in different language, modules; special classes of rings (group rings, division rings, universal enveloping algebras); related structures like rngs; as well as an array of properties that prove to be of interest both within the theory itself and for its applications, such as homological properties and polynomial identities.

Commutative rings are much better understood than noncommutative ones. Algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, have driven much of the development of commutative ring theory, which is now, under the name of &quot;commutative algebra&quot;, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. Similarly, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of commutative algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.

Noncommutative rings are quite different in flavour, since more unusual behavior can arise. While the theory has developed in its own right, a fairly recent trend has sought to parallel the commutative development by building the theory of certain classes of noncommutative rings in a geometric fashion as if they were rings of functions on (non-existent) &#x27;noncommutative spaces&#x27;. This trend started in the 1980s with the development of noncommutative geometry and with the discovery of quantum groups. It has led to a better understanding of noncommutative rings, especially noncommutative Noetherian rings.

For the definitions of a ring and basic concepts and their properties, see &quot;Ring (mathematics)&quot;. The definitions of terms used throughout ring theory may be found in &quot;Glossary of ring theory&quot;.

==Commutative rings==

A ring is called &quot;commutative&quot; if its multiplication is commutative. Commutative rings resemble familiar number systems, and various definitions for commutative rings are designed to formalize properties of the integers. Commutative rings are also important in algebraic geometry. In commutative ring theory, numbers are often replaced by ideals, and the definition of the prime ideal tries to capture the essence of prime numbers. Integral domains, non-trivial commutative rings where no two non-zero elements multiply to give zero, generalize another property of the integers and serve as the proper realm to study divisibility. Principal ideal domains are integral domains in which every ideal can be generated by a single element, another property shared by the integers. Euclidean domains are integral domains in which the Euclidean algorithm can be carried out. Important examples of commutative rings can be constructed as rings of polynomials and their factor rings. Summary: Euclidean domain ⊂ principal ideal domain ⊂ unique factorization domain ⊂ integral domain ⊂ commutative ring.

===Algebraic geometry===

Algebraic geometry is in many ways the mirror image of commutative algebra. This correspondence started with Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the points of an algebraic variety, and the maximal ideals of its coordinate ring. This correspondence has been enlarged and systematized for translating (and proving) most geometrical properties of algebraic varieties into algebraic properties of associated commutative rings. Alexander Grothendieck completed this by introducing schemes, a generalization of algebraic varieties, which may be built from any commutative ring. More precisely, 
the spectrum of a commutative ring is the space of its prime ideals equipped with Zariski topology, and augmented with a sheaf of rings. These objects are the &quot;affine schemes&quot; (generalization of affine varieties), and a general scheme is then obtained by &quot;gluing together&quot; (by purely algebraic methods) several such affine schemes, in analogy to the way of constructing a manifold by gluing together the charts of an atlas.

==Noncommutative rings==

Noncommutative rings resemble rings of matrices in many respects. Following the model of algebraic geometry, attempts have been made recently at defining noncommutative geometry based on noncommutative rings.
Noncommutative rings and associative algebras (rings that are also vector spaces) are often studied via their categories of modules. A module over a ring is an abelian group that the ring acts on as a ring of endomorphisms, very much akin to the way fields (integral domains in which every non-zero element is invertible) act on vector spaces. Examples of noncommutative rings are given by rings of square matrices or more generally by rings of endomorphisms of abelian groups or modules, and by monoid rings.

===Representation theory===

Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that draws heavily on non-commutative rings. It studies abstract algebraic structures by &quot;representing&quot; their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, and studies
modules over these abstract algebraic structures. In essence, a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and the algebraic operations in terms of matrix addition and matrix multiplication, which is non-commutative. The algebraic objects amenable to such a description include groups, associative algebras and Lie algebras. The most prominent of these (and historically the first) is the representation theory of groups, in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices in such a way that the group operation is matrix multiplication.

==Structures and invariants of rings==

===Dimension of a commutative ring===

In this section, &quot;R&quot; denotes a commutative ring. The Krull dimension of &quot;R&quot; is the supremum of the lengths &quot;n&quot; of all the chains of prime ideals formula_1. It turns out that the polynomial ring formula_2 over a field &quot;k&quot; has dimension &quot;n&quot;. The fundamental theorem of dimension theory states that the following numbers coincide for a noetherian local ring formula_3:
*The Krull dimension of &quot;R&quot;.
*The minimum number of the generators of the formula_4-primary ideals.
*The dimension of the graded ring formula_5 (equivalently, 1 plus the degree of its Hilbert polynomial).

A commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is said to be catenary if for every pair of prime ideals formula_6, there exists a finite chain of prime ideals formula_7 that is maximal in the sense that it is impossible to insert an additional prime ideal between two ideals in the chain, and all such maximal chains between formula_8 and formula_9 have the same length. Practically all noetherian rings that appear in applications are catenary. Ratliff proved that a noetherian local integral domain &quot;R&quot; is catenary if and only if for every prime ideal formula_8,
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the height of formula_8.

If &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain that is a finitely generated &quot;k&quot;-algebra, then its dimension is the transcendence degree of its field of fractions over &quot;k&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; is an integral extension of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot; have the same dimension.

Closely related concepts are those of depth and global dimension. In general, if &quot;R&quot; is a noetherian local ring, then the depth of &quot;R&quot; is less than or equal to the dimension of &quot;R&quot;. When the equality holds, &quot;R&quot; is called a Cohen–Macaulay ring. A regular local ring is an example of a Cohen–Macaulay ring. It is a theorem of Serre that &quot;R&quot; is a regular local ring if and only if it has finite global dimension and in that case the global dimension is the Krull dimension of &quot;R&quot;. The significance of this is that a global dimension is a homological notion.

===Morita equivalence===

Two rings &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot; are said to be Morita equivalent if the category of left modules over &quot;R&quot; is equivalent to the category of left modules over &quot;S&quot;. In fact, two commutative rings which are Morita equivalent must be isomorphic, so the notion does not add anything new to the category of commutative rings. However, commutative rings can be Morita equivalent to noncommutative rings, so Morita equivalence is coarser than isomorphism. Morita equivalence is especially important in algebraic topology and functional analysis.

===Finitely generated projective module over a ring and Picard group===
Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring and formula_14 the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over &quot;R&quot;; let also formula_15 subsets consisting of those with constant rank &quot;n&quot;. (The rank of a module &quot;M&quot; is the continuous function formula_16.) formula_17 is usually denoted by Pic(&quot;R&quot;). It is an abelian group called the Picard group of &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain with the field of fractions &quot;F&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, then there is an exact sequence of groups:
:formula_18
where formula_19 is the set of fractional ideals of &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; is a regular domain (i.e., regular at any prime ideal), then Pic(R) is precisely the divisor class group of &quot;R&quot;.

For example, if &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain, then Pic(&quot;R&quot;) vanishes. In algebraic number theory, &quot;R&quot; will be taken to be the ring of integers, which is Dedekind and thus regular. It follows that Pic(&quot;R&quot;) is a finite group (finiteness of class number) that measures the deviation of the ring of integers from being a PID.

One can also consider the group completion of formula_14; this results in a commutative ring K0(R). Note that K0(R) = K0(S) if two commutative rings &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot; are Morita equivalent.

===Structure of noncommutative rings===
The structure of a noncommutative ring is more complicated than that of a commutative ring. For example, there exist simple rings that contain no non-trivial proper (two-sided) ideals, yet contain non-trivial proper left or right ideals. Various invariants exist for commutative rings, whereas invariants of noncommutative rings are difficult to find. As an example, the nilradical of a ring, the set of all nilpotent elements, is not necessarily an ideal unless the ring is commutative. Specifically, the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring of all matrices over a division ring never forms an ideal, irrespective of the division ring chosen. There are, however, analogues of the nilradical defined for noncommutative rings, that coincide with the nilradical when commutativity is assumed.

The concept of the Jacobson radical of a ring; that is, the intersection of all right (left) annihilators of simple right (left) modules over a ring, is one example. The fact that the Jacobson radical can be viewed as the intersection of all maximal right (left) ideals in the ring, shows how the internal structure of the ring is reflected by its modules. It is also a fact that the intersection of all maximal right ideals in a ring is the same as the intersection of all maximal left ideals in the ring, in the context of all rings; irrespective of whether the ring is commutative.

Noncommutative rings are an active area of research due to their ubiquity in mathematics. For instance, the ring of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over a field is noncommutative despite its natural occurrence in geometry, physics and many parts of mathematics. More generally, endomorphism rings of abelian groups are rarely commutative, the simplest example being the endomorphism ring of the Klein four-group.

One of the best-known strictly noncommutative ring is the quaternions.

==Applications==

===The ring of integers of a number field===
===The coordinate ring of an algebraic variety===
If &quot;X&quot; is an affine algebraic variety, then the set of all regular functions on &quot;X&quot; forms a ring called the coordinate ring of &quot;X&quot;. For a projective variety, there is an analogous ring called the homogeneous coordinate ring. Those rings are essentially the same things as varieties: they correspond in essentially a unique way. This may be seen via either Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz or scheme-theoretic constructions (i.e., Spec and Proj).

===Ring of invariants===
A basic (and perhaps the most fundamental) question in the classical invariant theory is to find and study polynomials in the polynomial ring formula_21 that are invariant under the action of a finite group (or more generally reductive) &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot;. The main example is the ring of symmetric polynomials: symmetric polynomials are polynomials that are invariant under permutation of variable. The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials states that this ring is formula_22 where formula_23 are elementary symmetric polynomials.

==History==
Commutative ring theory originated in algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. Central to the development of these subjects were the rings of integers in algebraic number fields and algebraic function fields, and the rings of polynomials in two or more variables. Noncommutative ring theory began with attempts to extend the complex numbers to various hypercomplex number systems. The genesis of the theories of commutative and noncommutative rings dates back to the early 19th century, while their maturity was achieved only in the third decade of the 20th century.

More precisely, William Rowan Hamilton put forth the quaternions and biquaternions; James Cockle presented tessarines and coquaternions; and William Kingdon Clifford was an enthusiast of split-biquaternions, which he called &quot;algebraic motors&quot;. These noncommutative algebras, and the non-associative Lie algebras, were studied within universal algebra before the subject was divided into particular mathematical structure types. One sign of re-organization was the use of direct sums to describe algebraic structure.

The various hypercomplex numbers were identified with matrix rings by Joseph Wedderburn (1908) and Emil Artin (1928). Wedderburn&#x27;s structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional algebras over a field while Artin generalized them to Artinian rings.

In 1920, Emmy Noether, in collaboration with W. Schmeidler, published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring. The following year she published a landmark paper called &quot;Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen&quot;, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work &quot;revolutionary&quot;; the publication gave rise to the term &quot;Noetherian ring&quot;, and several other mathematical objects being called &quot;Noetherian&quot;.

<text>Chain stitch is a sewing and embroidery technique in which a series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern. Chain stitch is an ancient craft – examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th – 3rd century BC). Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic &quot;drawing&quot; in thread.

Chain stitches are also used in making tambour lace, needlelace, macramé and crochet.

In Azerbaijan, in the Sheki region, this ancient type of needlework is called &quot;tekeldus&quot;.

==History==

The earliest archaeological evidence of chain stitch embroidery dates from 1100 BC in China. Excavated from royal tombs, the embroidery was made using threads of silk. Chain stitch embroidery has also been found dating to the Warring States period. Chain stitch designs spread to Iran through the Silk Road.

==Applications==

===Hand embroidery===
Chain stitch and its variations are fundamental to embroidery traditions of many cultures, including Kashmiri &quot;numdahs&quot;, Iranian Resht work, Central Asian suzani, Hungarian Kalotaszeg &quot;written embroidery&quot;, Jacobean embroidery, and crewelwork.

===Machine sewing and embroidery===
Chain stitch was the stitch used by early sewing machines; however, as it is easily unravelled from fabric, this was soon replaced with the more secure lockstitch. This ease of unraveling of the single-thread chain stitch, more specifically known as ISO 4915:1991 stitch 101, continues to be exploited for industrial purposes in the closure of bags for bulk products.

Machine embroidery in chain stitch, often in traditional hand-worked crewel designs, is found on curtains, bed linens, and upholstery fabrics.
==Variants==

===Hand variants===

Variations of the basic chain stitch include:
* Back-stitched chain stitch
* Braided stitching
* Cable chain stitch
* Knotted chain stitch
* Open chain stitch
* Petal chain stitch
* Rosette chain stitch
* Singalese chain stitch
* Twisted chain stitch
* Wheat-ear stitch
* Zig-zag chain stitch

===Machine variants===
* The basic chain stitch is made by first sending the needle down through the material. Then, as the needle rises upward, the friction of the thread against the fabric is sufficient to form a small loop on the underside of the material. That loop is caught by a circular needle which is beneath the work. The machine then moves the material forward projecting the loop on the underside from the previous stitch. The next drop of the needle goes through the previous loop. The circular needle then releases the first loop and picks up the new loop and the process repeats.
* The double chain stitch uses two threads. It is rarely used in today&#x27;s machines except for ornamental purposes because it uses more thread than other stitches. It is found in bulk material packaging, where it is used to close large bags. As this stitch can be easily unraveled, this permits easy opening of bags sewn shut in this manner.

<text>Simultaneous equations models are a type of statistical model in which the dependent variables are functions of other dependent variables, rather than just independent variables. This means some of the explanatory variables are jointly determined with the dependent variable, which in economics usually is the consequence of some underlying equilibrium mechanism. Take the typical supply and demand model: whilst typically one would determine the quantity supplied and demanded to be a function of the price set by the market, it is also possible for the reverse to be true, where producers observe the quantity that consumers demand &quot;and then&quot; set the price.

Simultaneity poses challenges for the estimation of the statistical parameters of interest, because the Gauss–Markov assumption of strict exogeneity of the regressors is violated. And while it would be natural to estimate all simultaneous equations at once, this often leads to a computationally costly non-linear optimization problem even for the simplest system of linear equations. This situation prompted the development, spearheaded by the Cowles Commission in the 1940s and 1950s, of various techniques that estimate each equation in the model seriatim, most notably limited information maximum likelihood and two-stage least squares.

== Structural and reduced form ==
Suppose there are &quot;m&quot; regression equations of the form
: formula_1

where &quot;i&quot; is the equation number, and is the observation index. In these equations &quot;xit&quot; is the &quot;ki×&quot;1 vector of exogenous variables, &quot;yit&quot; is the dependent variable, &quot;y−i,t&quot; is the &quot;ni×&quot;1 vector of all other endogenous variables which enter the &quot;i&quot;th equation on the right-hand side, and &quot;uit&quot; are the error terms. The “−&quot;i&quot;” notation indicates that the vector &quot;y−i,t&quot; may contain any of the &quot;y&quot;’s except for &quot;yit&quot; (since it is already present on the left-hand side). The regression coefficients &quot;βi&quot; and &quot;γi&quot; are of dimensions &quot;ki×&quot;1 and &quot;ni×&quot;1 correspondingly. Vertically stacking the &quot;T&quot; observations corresponding to the &quot;i&quot;th equation, we can write each equation in vector form as
: formula_2
where &quot;yi&quot; and &quot;ui&quot; are &quot;T×&quot;1 vectors, &quot;Xi&quot; is a &quot;T×ki&quot; matrix of exogenous regressors, and &quot;Y−i&quot; is a &quot;T×ni&quot; matrix of endogenous regressors on the right-hand side of the &quot;i&quot;th equation. Finally, we can move all endogenous variables to the left-hand side and write the &quot;m&quot; equations jointly in vector form as
: formula_3
This representation is known as the structural form. In this equation is the &quot;T×m&quot; matrix of dependent variables. Each of the matrices &quot;Y−i&quot; is in fact an &quot;ni&quot;-columned submatrix of this &quot;Y&quot;. The &quot;m×m&quot; matrix Γ, which describes the relation between the dependent variables, has a complicated structure. It has ones on the diagonal, and all other elements of each column &quot;i&quot; are either the components of the vector &quot;−γi&quot; or zeros, depending on which columns of &quot;Y&quot; were included in the matrix &quot;Y−i&quot;. The &quot;T×k&quot; matrix &quot;X&quot; contains all exogenous regressors from all equations, but without repetitions (that is, matrix &quot;X&quot; should be of full rank). Thus, each &quot;Xi&quot; is a &quot;ki&quot;-columned submatrix of &quot;X&quot;. Matrix Β has size &quot;k×m&quot;, and each of its columns consists of the components of vectors &quot;βi&quot; and zeros, depending on which of the regressors from &quot;X&quot; were included or excluded from &quot;Xi&quot;. Finally, is a &quot;T×m&quot; matrix of the error terms.

Postmultiplying the structural equation by , the system can be written in the reduced form as
: formula_4
This is already a simple general linear model, and it can be estimated for example by ordinary least squares. Unfortunately, the task of decomposing the estimated matrix formula_5 into the individual factors Β and is quite complicated, and therefore the reduced form is more suitable for prediction but not inference.

=== Assumptions ===
Firstly, the rank of the matrix &quot;X&quot; of exogenous regressors must be equal to &quot;k&quot;, both in finite samples and in the limit as (this later requirement means that in the limit the expression formula_6 should converge to a nondegenerate &quot;k×k&quot; matrix). Matrix Γ is also assumed to be non-degenerate.

Secondly, error terms are assumed to be serially independent and identically distributed. That is, if the &quot;t&quot;th row of matrix &quot;U&quot; is denoted by &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), then the sequence of vectors {&quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)} should be iid, with zero mean and some covariance matrix Σ (which is unknown). In particular, this implies that , and .

Lastly, assumptions are required for identification.

==Identification==
The identification conditions require that the system of linear equations be solvable for the unknown parameters.

More specifically, the &quot;order condition&quot;, a necessary condition for identification, is that for each equation , which can be phrased as “the number of excluded exogenous variables is greater or equal to the number of included endogenous variables”.

The &quot;rank condition&quot;, a stronger condition which is necessary and sufficient, is that the rank of equals , where is a matrix which is obtained from by crossing out those columns which correspond to the excluded endogenous variables, and those rows which correspond to the included exogenous variables.

===Using cross-equation restrictions to achieve identification===

In simultaneous equations models, the most common method to achieve identification is by imposing within-equation parameter restrictions. Yet, identification is also possible using cross equation restrictions.

To illustrate how cross equation restrictions can be used for identification, consider the following example from Wooldridge

:formula_7

where z&#x27;s are uncorrelated with u&#x27;s and y&#x27;s are endogenous variables. Without further restrictions, the first equation is not identified because there is no excluded exogenous variable. The second equation is just identified if , which is assumed to be true for the rest of discussion.

Now we impose the cross equation restriction of . Since the second equation is identified, we can treat as known for the purpose of identification. Then, the first equation becomes:

:formula_8

Then, we can use as instruments to estimate the coefficients in the above equation since there are one endogenous variable () and one excluded exogenous variable () on the right hand side. Therefore, cross equation restrictions in place of within-equation restrictions can achieve identification.

== Estimation ==

=== Two-stage least squares (2SLS) ===
The simplest and the most common estimation method for the simultaneous equations model is the so-called two-stage least squares method, developed independently by and . It is an equation-by-equation technique, where the endogenous regressors on the right-hand side of each equation are being instrumented with the regressors &quot;X&quot; from all other equations. The method is called “two-stage” because it conducts estimation in two steps:
: &quot;Step 1&quot;: Regress &quot;Y−i&quot; on &quot;X&quot; and obtain the predicted values formula_9;
: &quot;Step 2&quot;: Estimate &quot;γi&quot;, &quot;βi&quot; by the ordinary least squares regression of &quot;yi&quot; on formula_9 and &quot;Xi&quot;.

If the &quot;i&quot;th equation in the model is written as
: formula_11
where &quot;Zi&quot; is a &quot;T×&quot;(&quot;ni + ki&quot;) matrix of both endogenous and exogenous regressors in the &quot;i&quot;th equation, and &quot;δi&quot; is an (&quot;ni + ki&quot;)-dimensional vector of regression coefficients, then the 2SLS estimator of &quot;δi&quot; will be given by
: formula_12
where is the projection matrix onto the linear space spanned by the exogenous regressors &quot;X&quot;.

=== Indirect least squares ===
Indirect least squares is an approach in econometrics where the coefficients in a simultaneous equations model are estimated from the reduced form model using ordinary least squares. For this, the structural system of equations is transformed into the reduced form first. Once the coefficients are estimated the model is put back into the structural form.

=== Limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) ===
The “limited information” maximum likelihood method was suggested by M. A. Girshick in 1947, and formalized by T. W. Anderson and H. Rubin in 1949. It is used when one is interested in estimating a single structural equation at a time (hence its name of limited information), say for observation i:

: formula_13

The structural equations for the remaining endogenous variables Y−i are not specified, and they are given in their reduced form:
: formula_14

Notation in this context is different than for the simple IV case. One has:
* formula_15: The endogenous variable(s).
* formula_16: The exogenous variable(s)
* formula_17: The instrument(s) (often denoted formula_18)

The explicit formula for the LIML is:
: formula_19
where , and &quot;λ&quot; is the smallest characteristic root of the matrix:
: formula_20

where, in a similar way, .

In other words, &quot;λ&quot; is the smallest solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem, see :

: formula_21

==== K class estimators ====
The LIML is a special case of the K-class estimators:
: formula_22

with:
* formula_23
* formula_24
Several estimators belong to this class:
* κ=0: OLS
* κ=1: 2SLS. Note indeed that in this case, formula_25 the usual projection matrix of the 2SLS
* κ=λ: LIML
* κ=λ - α / (n-K): estimator. Here K represents the number of instruments, n the sample size, and α a positive constant to specify. A value of α=1 will yield an estimator that is approximately unbiased.

=== Three-stage least squares (3SLS) ===
The three-stage least squares estimator was introduced by . It can be seen as a special case of multi-equation GMM where the set of instrumental variables is common to all equations. If all regressors are in fact predetermined, then 3SLS reduces to seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR). Thus it may also be seen as a combination of two-stage least squares (2SLS) with SUR.

== Applications in social science ==
Across fields and disciplines simultaneous equation models are applied to various observational phenomena. These equations are applied when phenomena are assumed to be reciprocally causal. The classic example is supply and demand in economics. In other disciplines there are examples such as candidate evaluations and party identification or public opinion and social policy in political science; road investment and travel demand in geography; and educational attainment and parenthood entry in sociology or demography. The simultaneous equation model requires a theory of reciprocal causality that includes special features if the causal effects are to be estimated as simultaneous feedback as opposed to one-sided &#x27;blocks&#x27; of an equation where a researcher is interested in the causal effect of X on Y while holding the causal effect of Y on X constant, or when the researcher knows the exact amount of time it takes for each causal effect to take place, i.e., the length of the causal lags. Instead of lagged effects, simultaneous feedback means estimating the simultaneous and perpetual impact of X and Y on each other. This requires a theory that causal effects are simultaneous in time, or so complex that they appear to behave simultaneously; a common example are the moods of roommates. To estimate simultaneous feedback models a theory of equilibrium is also necessary – that X and Y are in relatively steady states or are part of a system (society, market, classroom) that is in a relatively stable state.

<doc id="250437" wikidata="Q15523" url="?curid=250437" title="Lake Como">
<text>Lake Como ( , ), also known as Lario, is a lake of glacial origin in Lombardy, Italy.

It has an area of , making it the third-largest lake in Italy, after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore. At over deep, it is the fifth-deepest lake in Europe and the deepest outside Norway; the bottom of the lake is below sea level. One notable characteristic is its distinctive &quot;Y&quot; shape.

Lake Como has been a popular retreat for aristocrats and wealthy people since Roman times, and a very popular tourist attraction with many artistic and cultural gems. It has many villas and palaces such as Villa Olmo, Villa Serbelloni and Villa Carlotta. Many famous people have owned homes on the shores of Lake Como, including George Clooney, Madonna and Donatella Versace.

In 2014, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; described it as the most beautiful lake in the world for its microclimate and environment with prestigious villas and villages.

==Name==
The lake&#x27;s official name is &quot;Lario&quot; (derived from the Latin &quot;Larius&quot;), but it is rarely used informally, while it is still used in formal language; it is also found in the toponym of some villages along the lake such as Pognana Lario and Mandello del Lario; It is locally known as &quot;Lago di Como&quot; in Italian. The colloquial term for the lake comes from the town of Como that is located on the shores of this body of water, which is considered to be the main hub of the lake.

==Geography==

The lake is shaped much like an inverted letter &quot;Y&quot;. The northern branch begins at the town of Colico, while the towns of Como and Lecco sit at the ends of the southwestern and southeastern branches respectively. The small towns of Bellagio, Menaggio and Varenna are situated at the intersection of the three branches of the lake: a boat service operates a triangular route between them.

Lake Como is fed primarily by the Adda, which enters the lake near Colico and flows out at Lecco. This geological conformation makes the southwestern branch a dead end, and so Como, unlike Lecco, is sometimes flooded.

The mountainous pre-alpine territory between the two southern arms of the lake (between Como, Bellagio and Lecco) is known as the Larian Triangle, or &quot;Triangolo lariano&quot;. The source of the river Lambro is here. At the centre of the triangle, the town of Canzo is the seat of the &quot;Comunità Montana del Triangolo lariano&quot;, an association of the 31 municipalities that represent the 71,000 inhabitants of the area.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification, the Lake Como area is categorized as humid subtropical climate; average temperatures range from in January to in July.
Water temperatures reach an average of in July.

* Winter – The lake helps to maintain a mild average temperature () in the surrounding region; snowfall is erratic and occurs mainly at higher elevations; from time to time, periods of frost from the Siberian Anticyclone have been observed.
* Spring and Autumn – These seasons are well marked and pleasant, with average daytime temperatures around , and are distinguished by increased precipitation.
* Summer – During this season average daytime temperatures hover above and heatwaves have been recurring in recent years with temperatures reaching as high as , so summer can be quite hot and muggy. This season is also subject to thunderstorms and, at times, violent hailstorms.

===Climate change===

Until the late 20th century winters used to be quite snowy and cold, with average daily temperatures well below freezing in January and February; however, due to global warming, average temperatures in winter have gradually risen since the turn of the 21st century, reaching a record high of on January 27, 2024; until the late 2000s summers as well used to be distinguished by pleasant climate but since the 2010s average temperatures have been constantly rising and once rare severe weather events, such as rainstorms and hailstorms, have been happening with increased frequency.


==History==
At the beginning of the first millennium B.C. during the Iron Age, the &quot;Comum oppidum&quot; was born and the civilization of Como developed, inserted in the broader Golasecca culture. In 196 B.C. the army of the consul Claudius Marcellus defeats the Celts tribe of the &quot;Comenses&quot; and conquered the city. Comum was then strengthened and rebuilt after a raid by Rhaetian and repopulated with 3,000 settlers in 77 B.C. Finally, after having reclaimed the marshy area, in 59 B.C. it was re-founded with the name of &quot;Novum Comun&quot; in its current location on the lake shore at the behest of Gaius Julius Caesar. Pliny the Younger, in one of his &quot;Epistulae&quot;, describes the lake and its surrounding area as providing plentiful opportunities for fishing and hunting. According to the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, at least since the 4th century, a &quot;Praefectus&quot; commanding a Roman military fleet was present on the lake.

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the waters of the lake were the scene of military clashes, such as in the 12th century during the war of Milan against Como, which saw the Como fleet in action against the ships of the Milanese and their allies or between 1525 and 1532 due to the Musso war unleashed by Gian Giacomo Medici.

On 28 April 1945, deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was executed in the lakeside village of Giulino, about from the waterfront.

==Tourism==
As a tourist destination, Lake Como is popular for its landscapes, wildlife and spas. It is a venue for sailing, windsurfing and kitesurfing.

Although generally considered safe, bathers aiming to find relief from the heat and swimming enthusiasts alike should exercise caution, as a prevailing regulation prohibits diving and swimming both in the city of Como and in the various small villages along the lake. Exceptions are found only in privately managed lidos or designated public beaches where explicit signage permits swimming activities. This prohibition stems from the danger posed by the lake&#x27;s waters that swiftly transition from shallow to deep near the shoreline and from unpredictable aquatic conditions, which have led to numerous incidents, including drowning cases attributed to sudden thermal shock.

===Lakeside villas===


The lake is well known for the attractive villas that have been built there since Roman times when Pliny the Younger built the &quot;Comedia&quot; and the &quot;Tragedia&quot; resorts. Many villas on the lake shores have admirable gardens that benefit from the mild climate induced by the stabilizing presence of of lake water and can sustain many subtropical and Mediterranean plants.

Villa Carlotta was built for the Milanese Marquis Giorgio Clerici in 1690 and occupies a site of over at Tremezzo, facing the Bellagio peninsula. An Italian garden (with steps, fountains and sculptures) was laid out at the same time. The villa was later sold to powerful banker and Napoleonic politician Giovanni Battista Sommariva. Stendhal was his guest in 1818, and his visit is recalled at the start of &quot;La Chartreuse de Parme&quot;. In 1843 it was purchased by Princess Marianne of Nassau as a wedding present for her daughter Carlotta, after whom the villa is now named. The latter, together with her husband Georg II of Saxen-Meiningen, laid out the woodland landscape park in Romantic style. The villa today includes a museum of agricultural implements as well as important works of sculpture by Sommariva&#x27;s friend Antonio Canova and by Luigi Acquisti.

Villa d&#x27;Este, in Cernobbio, was built in 1568 by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio, a native of the town. In 1816–1817 the villa was home to Caroline of Brunswick, estranged wife of the Prince of Wales and shortly to become queen consort of King George IV of the United Kingdom. The landscaped gardens in the English style are a product of this period. Later in the century, it was turned into a luxury hotel. Today the Villa d&#x27;Este is known for attracting celebrity guests.

Villa del Balbianello, famous for its elaborate terraced gardens, lies on a promontory of the western shore of the lake near Isola Comacina. Built in 1787 on the site of a Franciscan monastery, it was the home of explorer Guido Monzino and today houses a museum devoted to his work.

Villa Melzi d&#x27;Eril in Bellagio was built in neo-classical style by architect Giocondo Albertolli in 1808–1810 as the summer residence of Duke Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril, who was vice-president of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. The park includes an orangery, a private chapel, fine statues and a Japanese garden, and is planted, as often on Lake Como, with huge rhododendrons. Nineteenth-century guests at the Villa included Stendhal and Franz Liszt.

Villa Serbelloni, also in Bellagio, hosts the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, a international conference centre set up and managed by the Rockefeller Foundation since 1959, which also operates a &quot;scholar-in-residence&quot; program for scholars from around the world. This is believed to have been the site of Pliny the Younger&#x27;s villa &quot;Tragedia&quot;. Its well-known park was created at the end of the 18th century by Alessandro Serbelloni.

Villa Monastero, located in Varenna, is another notable example of an ex-monastery converted to a villa. It is an eclectic villa built in the Nordic style.

Many famous people have or have had homes on the shores of Lake Como, such as George Clooney.

===Transportation===
Lake Como is served by a public transport system connecting the various villages on the lake. A motorized service began in 1826 when a steamship with sails, the &quot;Lario&quot;, was launched by the newly established &quot;Società privilegiata per l&#x27;impresa dei battelli a vapore nel Regno Lombardo Veneto&quot;. Since 1952 the fleet has been managed by a government organisation named &quot;Gestione Commissariale Governativa&quot; and later &quot;Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi&quot;, which is also responsible for transport services on Lake Maggiore and Lake Garda.

There exist three primary services:

* Motorship services along the western branch and north towards Colico and back to Como, with additional shuttles to the mid-lake area;
* Fast services that broadly follow the same route but with fewer stops; the service, which is more expensive, is operated by hydrofoils;
* Ferries able to carry passengers and cars across the popular tourist destinations Menaggio, Bellagio, Varenna and Cadenabbia.
===Sacro Monte di Ossuccio===

The Sacro Monte di Ossuccio (&quot;Holy Mount of Ossuccio&quot;) is a sanctuary located on a hillside slope between olive groves and woods along the western edge of Lake Como facing Isola Comacina. Fifteen Baroque-inspired chapels, built between 1635 and 1710, and dedicated to the Mysteries of the Rosary are dotted along the way that leads to the Monastery. This building is the last in the chain and is dedicated to the Coronation of the Virgin.

In 2003, the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy, including that of Ossuccio, were added by UNESCO to the World Heritage List.

== Villages, resorts and other notable localities near the lake==

== Economy ==
Lake Como attracts visitors from around the world and as a consequence, the economy of the towns surrounding Lake Como is predominantly dependent on tourism and related activities. The tourism sector stimulates local businesses, including hospitality, restaurants and retail, while also fostering the growth of ancillary services such as transportation, cultural tours and recreational activities. This reliance on tourism has led to significant investments in infrastructure and amenities to accommodate and enhance the visitor experience, making it a vital component of the regional economy.

==In literature, film, and the arts==
* Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lake of Como&quot; was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, in 1837. It illustrates a painting by Samuel Prout, engraved by William Miller.
* In 1818 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote to Thomas Love Peacock: &quot;This lake exceeds anything I ever beheld in beauty, except the arbutus islands of Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has the appearance of a mighty river winding among the mountains and the forests.&quot;

* Several scenes from the 2002 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; were filmed at Lake Como.

<doc id="250438" wikidata="Q271768" url="?curid=250438" title="Slag">
<text>The general term slag may be a by-product or co-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and recycled metals depending on the type of material being produced. Slag is mainly a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (co-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (a by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by their precursor and processing conditions (e.g., blast furnace slags, air-cooled blast furnace slag, granulated blast furnace slag, basic oxygen furnace slag, and electric arc furnace slag). Slag generated from the EAF process can contain toxic metals, which can be hazardous to human and environmental health.
Due to the large demand for ferrous, ferralloy, and non-ferrous materials, slag production has increased throughout the years despite recycling (most notably in the iron and steelmaking industries) and upcycling efforts. The World Steel Association (WSA) estimates that 600 kg of co-materials (co-products and by-products)(about 90 wt% is slags) are generated per tonne of steel produced.

==Composition==

Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide. However, slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals. It is important to note, the oxide form may or may not be present once the molten slag solidifies and forms amorphous and crystalline components.

The major components of these slags include the oxides of calcium, magnesium, silicon, iron, and aluminium, with lesser amounts of manganese, phosphorus, and others depending on the specifics of the raw materials used. Furthermore, slag can be classified based on the abundance of iron among other major components.

==Ore smelting==

In nature, iron, copper, lead, nickel, and other metals are found in impure states called ores, often oxidized and mixed in with silicates of other metals. During smelting, when the ore is exposed to high temperatures, these impurities are separated from the molten metal and can be removed. Slag is the collection of compounds that are removed. In many smelting processes, oxides are introduced to control the slag chemistry, assisting in the removal of impurities and protecting the furnace refractory lining from excessive wear. In this case, the slag is termed &quot;synthetic&quot;. A good example is steelmaking slag: quicklime (CaO) and magnesite (MgCO3) are introduced for refractory protection, neutralizing the alumina and silica separated from the metal, and assisting in the removal of sulfur and phosphorus from the steel.

As a co-product of steelmaking, slag is typically produced either through the blast furnace – oxygen converter route or the electric arc furnace – ladle furnace route. To flux the silica produced during steelmaking, limestone and/or dolomite are added, as well as other types of slag conditioners such as calcium aluminate or fluorspar.

== Classifications ==

There are three types of slag: ferrous, ferroalloy, non-ferrous slags, which are produced through different smelting processes.

=== Ferrous slag ===
Ferrous slags are produced in different stages of the iron and steelmaking processes resulting in varying physiochemical properties. Additionally, the rate of cooling of the slag material affects its degree of crystallinity further diversifying its range of properties. For example, slow cooled blast furnace slags (or air-cooled slags) tend have more crystalline phases than quenched blast furnace slags (ground granulated blast furnace slags) making it denser and better suited as an aggregate. It may also have higher free calcium oxide and magnesium oxide content, which are often converted to its hydrated forms if excessive volume expansions are not desired. On the other hand, water quenched blast furnace slags have greater amorphous phases giving it latent hydraulic properties (as discovered by Emil Langen in 1862) similar to Portland cement.

During the process of smelting iron, ferrous slag is created, but dominated by calcium and silicon compositions. Through this process, ferrous slag can be broken down into blast furnace slag (produced from iron oxides of molten iron), then steel slag (forms when steel scrap and molten iron combined). The major phases of ferrous slag contain calcium-rich olivine-group silicates and melilite-group silicates.

Slag from steel mills in ferrous smelting is designed to minimize iron loss, which gives out the significant amount of iron, following by oxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium. As the slag is cooled down by water, several chemical reactions from a temperature of around (such as oxidization) take place within the slag.

Based on a case study at the Hopewell National Historical Site in Berks and Chester counties, Pennsylvania, US, ferrous slag usually contains lower concentration of various types of trace elements than non-ferrous slag. However, some of them, such as arsenic (As), iron, and manganese, can accumulate in groundwater and surface water to levels that can exceed environmental guidelines.

=== Non-ferrous slag ===
Non-ferrous slag is produced from non-ferrous metals of natural ores. Non-ferrous slag can be characterized into copper, lead, and zinc slags due to the ores&#x27; compositions, and they have more potential to impact the environment negatively than ferrous slag. The smelting of copper, lead and bauxite in non-ferrous smelting, for instance, is designed to remove the iron and silica that often occurs with those ores, and separates them as iron-silicate-based slags. 

Copper slag, the waste product of smelting copper ores, was studied in an abandoned Penn Mine in California, US. For six to eight months per year, this region is flooded and becomes a reservoir for drinking water and irrigation. Samples collected from the reservoir showed the higher concentration of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) that exceeded regulatory guidelines.

== Applications ==
Slags can serve other purposes, such as assisting in the temperature control of the smelting, and minimizing any re-oxidation of the final liquid metal product before the molten metal is removed from the furnace and used to make solid metal. In some smelting processes, such as ilmenite smelting to produce titanium dioxide, the slag can be the valuable product.
===Ancient uses===
During the Bronze Age of the Mediterranean area there were a vast number of differential metallurgical processes in use. A slag by-product of such workings was a colorful, glassy material found on the surfaces of slag from ancient copper foundries. It was primarily blue or green and was formerly chipped away and melted down to make glassware products and jewelry. It was also ground into powder to add to glazes for use in ceramics. Some of the earliest such uses for the by-products of slag have been found in ancient Egypt.

Historically, the re-smelting of iron ore slag was common practice, as improved smelting techniques permitted greater iron yields—in some cases exceeding that which was originally achieved. During the early 20th century, iron ore slag was also ground to a powder and used to make agate glass, also known as slag glass.

===Modern uses===

==== Construction ====
Use of slags in the construction industry dates back to the 1800s, where blast furnace slags were used to build roads and railroad ballast. During this time, it was also used as an aggregate and had begun being integrated into the cement industry as a geopolymer.

Today, ground granulated blast furnace slags are used in combination with Portland cement to create &quot;slag cement&quot;. Granulated blast furnace slags react with portlandite (), which is formed during cement hydration, via the pozzolanic reaction to produce cementitious properties that primarily contribute to the later strength gain of concrete. This leads to concrete with reduced permeability and better durability. Careful consideration of the slag type used is required, as the high calcium oxide and magnesium oxide content can lead to excessive volume expansion and cracking in concrete.

These hydraulic properties have also been used for soil stabilization in roads and railroad constructions.

Granulated blast furnace slag is used in the manufacture of high-performance concretes, especially those used in the construction of bridges and coastal features, where its low permeability and greater resistance to chlorides and sulfates can help to reduce corrosive action and deterioration of the structure.

Slag can also be used to create fibers used as an insulation material called &quot;slag wool&quot;.

Slag is also used as aggregate in asphalt concrete for paving roads. A 2022 study in Finland found that road surfaces containing ferrochrome slag release a highly abrasive dust that has caused car parts to wear at significantly greater than normal rates.

==== Wastewater treatment and agriculture ====
Dissolution of slags generate alkalinity that can be used to precipitate out metals, sulfates, and excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in wastewater treatment. Similarly, ferrous slags have been used as soil conditioners to re-balance soil pH and fertilizers as sources of calcium and magnesium.  

Because of the slowly released phosphate content in phosphorus-containing slag, and because of its liming effect, it is valued as fertilizer in gardens and farms in steel making areas. However, the most important application is construction.

==== Emerging applications ====
Slags have one of the highest carbonation potential among the industrial alkaline waste due their high calcium oxide and magnesium oxide content, inspiring further studies to test its feasibility in capture and storage (CCS) methods (e.g., direct aqueous sequestration, dry gas-solid carbonation among others). Across these CCS methods, slags can be transformed into precipitated calcium carbonates to be used in the plastic, and concrete industries and leached for metals to be used in the electronic industries.

However, high physical and chemical variability across different types of slags results in performance and yield inconsistencies. Moreover, stoichiometric-based calculation of the carbonation potential can lead to overestimation that can further obfuscate the material&#x27;s true potential. To this end, some have proposed performing a series of experiments testing the reactivity of a specific slag material (i.e., dissolution) or using the topological constraint theory (TCT) to account for its complex chemical network.

==Health and environmental effect==


Slags are transported along with slag tailings to &quot;slag dumps&quot;, where they are exposed to weathering, with the possibility of leaching of toxic elements and hyperalkaline runoffs into the soil and water, endangering the local ecological communities. Leaching concerns are typically around non-ferrous or base metal slags, which tend to have higher concentrations of toxic elements. However, ferrous and ferroalloy slags may also have them, which raises concerns about highly weathered slag dumps and upcycled materials.

Dissolution of slags can produce highly alkaline groundwater with pH values above 12. The calcium silicates (CaSiO4) in slags react with water to produce calcium hydroxide ions that leads to a higher concentration of hydroxide (OH-) in ground water. This alkalinity promotes the mineralization of dissolved (from the atmosphere) to produce calcite (CaCO3), which can accumulate to as thick as 20 cm. This can also lead to the dissolution of other metals in slag, such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and molybdenum (Mo), which become insoluble in water and mobile as particulate matter. The most effective method to detoxify alkaline ground water discharge is air sparging.

Fine slags and slag dusts generated from milling slags to be recycled into the smelting process or upcycled in a different industry (e.g. construction) can be carried by the wind, affecting a larger ecosystem. It can be ingested and inhaled, posing a direct health risk to the communities near the plants, mines, disposal sites, etc.

<text>Rodney Dwight Grams (February 4, 1948 – October 8, 2013) was an American politician and television news anchor who served in both the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. A local news anchor, Grams became well-known for working at Twin Cities station KMSP-TV from 1982 until 1991. He was a member of the Republican Party.

Grams was born on a farm in Princeton, Minnesota, and worked at several other news stations throughout the Midwest and Great Plains before serving as KMSP&#x27;s senior news anchor. After retiring from television, he launched a successful bid for Congress in Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district against embattled Democratic incumbent Gerry Sikorski in 1992. He served one term, opting to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican David Durenberger in 1994. He won the 1994 Senate election and was defeated for reelection by Mark Dayton in 2000.

Grams sought election to his old Senate seat in 2006, but dropped out before the Republican primary. He also ran again for election to the House in Minnesota&#x27;s 8th congressional district in 2006 as the Republican-endorsed candidate but lost to incumbent Democrat Jim Oberstar.

==Early life==
Grams was born on a farm in Princeton, Minnesota. He attended Brown Institute (1966–1968), Anoka-Ramsey Community College (1970–1972), and Carroll College (1974–1975).

Grams spent 23 years in television and radio broadcasting before launching a career in politics. From 1982 to 1991 he was the senior news anchor at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis/St. Paul. Before that, he worked as a news anchor/producer for KFBB-TV in Great Falls, Montana; WSAU-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin; and WIFR-TV in Rockford, Illinois. Before entering broadcasting, Grams worked at an engineering consulting firm for seven years. In 1985, he formed Sun Ridge Builders, a Twin Cities construction and residential development company, serving as its president and CEO. He was involved in architectural design and the use of solar energy in residential homes.

==Early political career==
Grams launched his political career by winning the 1992 Republican nomination in Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district. He defeated Democratic incumbent Gerry Sikorski in the general election. During the campaign, Grams benefited from high name recognition in the district—from years as news anchor at KMSP-TV—and Sikorski&#x27;s involvement in the House banking scandal. He served in the 103rd Congress as a member of the House of Representatives, and in the 104th, 105th, and 106th congresses as a member of the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senate==
After David Durenberger announced he would not seek reelection, Grams surprised many by announcing, just months into his first term in the U.S. House, that he would run for the Senate. Grams faced opposition for the Republican endorsement from State Senator Gen Olson, Bert McKasy (Durenberger&#x27;s former chief of staff), and Doug McFarland. During the party endorsement process, the Grams campaign closely aligned itself with supporters of Allen Quist, who was challenging incumbent Governor Arne Carlson for reelection in the 1994 gubernatorial race. Weeks before the state Republican convention, McFarland dropped out of the Senate race after endorsing Quist for governor and joining his ticket as Quist&#x27;s running mate.

After numerous ballots at the convention in St. Paul, Grams won the Republican endorsement over Olson and McKasy. He also won the Republican primary against Arne Carlson&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor Joanell Dyrstad, who had been replaced as his running mate by State Senator Joanne Benson. In the general election against Democratic Farmer Labor candidate Ann Wynia and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley, Grams won, 49% to 44%.

Grams ran for reelection in 2000, losing to Mark Dayton. During the campaign, Grams&#x27;s wife Christine Gunhus was revealed to have written anonymous disparaging emails about Grams&#x27;s potential Democratic rival Mike Ciresi from her home computer. She received a fine and suspended sentence for violating political advertising regulations. The Grams campaign also ran a commercial during the campaign featuring Grams&#x27;s mother, Audrey Grams, that ended with her saying, &quot;Uffda, vote for Rod.&quot;

==Post-Senate career==
After his 2000 reelection defeat, Grams went back into private business and in 2004 became the owner of three radio stations in Little Falls, Minnesota. He attempted a political comeback in the 2006 U.S. Senate campaign. He sought the GOP nomination for his former Senate seat, facing Mark Kennedy and Gil Gutknecht. After a poor showing early in the endorsement process, Grams dropped his Senate candidacy and ran in the 2006 U.S. House election, challenging the incumbent Jim Oberstar in Minnesota&#x27;s 8th congressional district. Oberstar defeated Grams handily.

Grams remained active in politics and interested in running for public office. In 2008, he considered challenging incumbent Norm Coleman for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination but was too busy in his private life to make a run, saying, &quot;And my wife (Chris) would have killed me if I would have, because of some things that we&#x27;re doing.&quot; It also became unclear whether Grams would run as a Republican. In an interview, he expressed disappointment at the perceived failings of the party, going as far as to wonder whether he could still call himself a Republican or vote for Republican candidates.

Grams considered a 2010 run for governor of Minnesota, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m so damn unhappy with the Republicans right now ... I&#x27;m so unhappy with the candidates that we have I could puke. I wanted to get out there and mix it up.&quot; But Grams endorsed Republican Tom Emmer in the 2010 campaign for governor. Emmer lost the election to Mark Dayton.

==Illness and death==
On September 4, 2013, it was announced that Grams had been battling colon cancer since 2012 and was receiving hospice care at his home. He died on October 8, 2013, aged 65, at his home in Crown, Minnesota.

<text>David Ferdinand Durenberger (August 19, 1934 – January 31, 2023) was an American politician and attorney from Minnesota who served as a Republican member of the United States Senate from 1978 to 1995. He left the Republican Party in 2005 and became a critic of it, endorsing Democratic presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in 2016 and 2020, respectively.

== Early life ==
Durenberger was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the son of Isabelle Marie (née Cebulla) and George Gephard Durenberger. He was a Roman Catholic of German and Polish descent. His father was the athletic director and a coach at College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, and the family lived on campus.

Durenberger graduated from St. John&#x27;s Preparatory School there in 1951, and from the university in 1955. He attended the University of Minnesota Law School and earned his Juris Doctor in 1959. At St. John&#x27;s he was the top-rated cadet in his Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps class, and after college was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1956 and a captain in the United States Army Reserve from 1957 to 1963.

== Professional career ==
After law school, Durenberger was employed by a South St. Paul, Minnesota law firm with strong political connections. It had been founded in 1929 by Republican Harold Stassen, later the Governor of Minnesota from 1939 to 1943, and Elmer Ryan, a Democrat who was member of the United States House of Representatives from 1935 to 1941. When Durenberger joined it was headed by Harold LeVander. The firm took the name LeVander, Gillen, Miller and Durenberger.

LeVander, a Republican, was elected governor of Minnesota in 1966 and took office in January 1967, and Durenberger became his executive secretary from then until the end of LeVander&#x27;s term in 1971. He then joined the H.B. Fuller as in-house counsel, corporate secretary, and manager of international licensing until 1978. He also served as chair of the Metropolitan Open Space Advisory Board from 1972 to 1974 and was on the Minnesota State Ethical Practices Board from 1974 to 1978.

== United States Senate ==
On November 7, 1978, Durenberger was elected to the United States Senate in a special election to complete the unexpired term of Senator Hubert Humphrey, who died earlier in the year; Humphrey&#x27;s wife Muriel Humphrey held the seat until Durenberger&#x27;s election. Durenberger was reelected in 1982 and again in 1988, defeating Mark Dayton and Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey, respectively.

In the 99th Congress, Durenberger chaired the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Health Subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, giving him a leadership role in national health reform. He also chaired the Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee, led President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s New Federalism effort in 1982, and was a 14-year member of the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations. He was a member of the Senate Environment Committee, the Government Affairs Committee, and the committee now known as the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and served as vice chair of the Pepper Commission in 1989–90.

Durenberger was Senate sponsor of the Medicare Catastrophic act, the AHCPR (now AHRQ) on voting rights for the disabled, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Thousand points of light, President Bill Clinton&#x27;s National and Community Service Act, National Service Learning, the Consumer Choice Education Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Direct Lending Act, and the Women&#x27;s Economic Equity Act. Durenberger voted for the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto). He voted to confirm Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States.

=== Misuse of public funds ===
In 1990, the senate voted 96–0 to censure Durenberger for ethics violations related to evading limits on $100,000 in speaking fees and using his condominium in Minneapolis to collect $40,000 in travel reimbursements. The Minnesota Supreme Court indefinitely suspended Durenberger&#x27;s Minnesota law license on January 11, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation. It reinstated his license on March 22, 2000.

Durenberger did not run for reelection in 1994 and was succeeded by Rod Grams. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to charges of misuse of public funds while in office and was sentenced to one year of probation.

== Post-Senate life ==

In a 2005 interview, Durenberger said he no longer supported the Republican Party but did not support the Democratic Party either. He also said that Democrats are better equipped to handle health care and that President George W. Bush was wrong about the Iraq War. In 2010, Durenberger endorsed his former chief of staff, Independence-Alliance Party member Tom Horner, for governor.

Durenberger chaired the National Institute of Health Policy (NIHP) and was a Senior Health Policy Fellow at the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He served on the board of National Coalition on HealthCare. He has also served on national health commissions and boards, including the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and Board of the National Commission on Quality Assurance (NCQA), and the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.

Durenberger endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president in 2020. He was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Personal life==
Durenberger&#x27;s first wife, Judith, whom he married in 1962, died of cancer in 1970. He married his second wife, Penny, in 1971; they separated in 1985 and divorced in 1993. Durenberger married his third wife, Susan, in 1995. He had four sons and two stepchildren.

Durenberger died of heart failure at home in St. Paul on January 31, 2023, at age 88.

==Writings==

A collection of Durenberger&#x27;s senatorial files is held by the Minnesota Historical Society. It documents his three terms in the United States Senate and is strongest in its documentation of the third (1989–95). The papers are perhaps most significant for the information they contain about his interest in, and legislative activities regarding, health policy and health care reform issues.

Durenberger&#x27;s books include &quot;When Republicans were Progressive,&quot; which traces the history of Minnesota&#x27;s Republican party from the era of Stassen, a moderate Republican governor who took office in 1939, to the ascent of a more conservative strain within the party in the late 1980s (Durenberger lamented the polarization of more recent politics); &quot;Neither Madmen nor Messiahs: A Policy of National Security for America&quot; (1984), on defense policy; and &quot;Prescription for Change&quot; (1986), on health care reform.

<doc id="250451" wikidata="Q310588" url="?curid=250451" title="Dennis Kucinich">
<text>Dennis John Kucinich ( ; October 8, 1946) is an American politician. Originally a Democrat, Kucinich served as U.S. Representative from Ohio&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. From 1977 to 1979, he served a term as mayor of Cleveland, where he narrowly survived a recall election and successfully fought an effort to sell the municipal electric utility before losing his reelection contest to George Voinovich.

Considered one of the most politically liberal members of Congress during his tenure, Kucinich unsuccessfully ran for president in the 2004 and 2008 Democratic primaries. During his 2004 presidential campaign, he ran as a staunch opponent of the Iraq War, garnering him support among some anti-war activists. Despite not winning a single primary contest, Kucinich was the last opponent of eventual nominee John Kerry to drop out.

As a 2008 presidential candidate, Kucinich ran in support of single-payer health care, the impeachment of then-Vice President Dick Cheney, and the establishment of a &quot;Department of Peace&quot;. He dropped out early during the 2008 primary contest after faring poorly in early states. During his final two terms in Congress, Kucinich at times criticized then-President Barack Obama, and argued in favor of Obama&#x27;s impeachment following the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

As a result of redistricting following the 2010 census, redrawn congressional boundaries forced Kucinich to face Representative Marcy Kaptur in the newly-drawn 9th district. Kaptur defeated Kucinich in the Democratic primary, and Kucinich left office in 2013. In January 2013, he became a contributor on the Fox News Channel appearing on programs such as &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. He ran for governor of Ohio in the 2018 election, losing in the primary to Richard Cordray. Kucinich was also an unsuccessful primary candidate in the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election. He ran for Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district as an independent in 2024 and finished third, garnering 12% of the vote.

==Early life and education==
Kucinich was born in Cleveland&#x27;s West Side Tremont neighborhood, the oldest of the seven children of Virginia (née Norris) and Frank J. Kucinich. His father, who was of Croat ancestry, worked as a truck driver and was a member of the Teamsters for 35 years; his Irish American mother was a homemaker. Growing up, his family moved 21 times and Dennis was often charged with the responsibility of finding apartments they could afford.

Kucinich graduated from St. John Cantius High School in 1965. He attended Cleveland State University from 1967 to 1970. In 1973, he graduated from Case Western Reserve University with both a Bachelor and a Master of Arts degree in speech and communication.

== Early political career ==
Kucinich&#x27;s political career began in 1967 when he ran unsuccessfully for office. In 1969, he was elected to the Cleveland City Council at the age of 23. In 1972, Kucinich ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing narrowly to incumbent Republican William E. Minshall Jr. After Minshall&#x27;s retirement in 1974, Kucinich sought the seat again, this time failing to get the Democratic nomination, which went to Ronald M. Mottl. Kucinich ran as an Independent candidate in the general election, placing third with about 30% of the vote. In 1975, Kucinich became clerk of the municipal court in Cleveland and served in that position for two years.

=== Cleveland mayor ===
Kucinich was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1977 and served in that position until 1979. At age 31, he was the youngest mayor of a major city in the United States, earning him the nickname &quot;the boy mayor of Cleveland&quot;. Kucinich&#x27;s tenure as mayor is often regarded as one of the most tumultuous in Cleveland&#x27;s history.

After Kucinich refused to sell Municipal Light (now Cleveland Public Power), Cleveland&#x27;s publicly owned electric utility, the Cleveland mafia sought to murder him in a contract killing. A hit man from Maryland planned to shoot him in the head during the Columbus Day Parade, but the plot fell apart when Kucinich was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer and missed the event. When the city fell into default shortly thereafter, the Mafia leaders called off the contract killer.

In 1984, John F. Sopko, then assistant counsel to the Minority Subcommittee staff, testified to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, &quot;Intelligence information gleaned by the Maryland State Police and Cleveland Police Department confirmed that the murder contract was, in general terms, due to the fact that Kucinich had caused considerable problems for local dishonest businessmen, politicians and criminals.&quot; Sopko said, &quot;It was alleged that Kucinich had been impeding organized criminal activities and its ability to make money in the city. As a result, someone decided to do away with the mayor.&quot;

The Cleveland Trust Company suddenly required all the city&#x27;s debts be paid in full, forcing the city into default, after news of Kucinich&#x27;s refusal to sell the city utility. For years, these debts were routinely rolled over, pending future payment, until Kucinich&#x27;s announcement was made public. In 1998, the Cleveland City Council honored him for having had the &quot;courage and foresight&quot; to stand up to the banks, which saved the city an estimated $195 million between 1985 and 1995.

=== Post-mayoralty ===

After losing his reelection bid for mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept a low profile in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum Voinovich proposed in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. For the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for him financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and borrowed money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. Of this period, Kucinich has said, &quot;When I was growing up in Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It&#x27;s one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through.&quot;

In 1982, Kucinich moved back to Cleveland and ran for Secretary of State; he lost the Democratic primary to Sherrod Brown. In 1983, Kucinich won a special election to fill the seat of a Cleveland city councilman who had died. His brother, Gary Kucinich, was also a councilman at the time.

In 1985, there was some speculation that Kucinich might run for mayor again. Instead, his brother Gary ran against (and lost to) the incumbent Voinovich. Kucinich, meanwhile, gave up his council position to run for governor of Ohio as an independent against Richard Celeste, but later withdrew from the race. After this, Kucinich, in his own words &quot;on a quest for meaning,&quot; lived quietly in New Mexico until 1994, when he won a seat in the Ohio State Senate.

== House of Representatives ==

In 1996, Kucinich was elected to represent Ohio&#x27;s 10th district in the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating two-term Republican incumbent Martin Hoke by three percentage points. He never faced another general election contest that close and was reelected seven times.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Education and the Workforce
** Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
** Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
** Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending (Ranking Member)

Kucinich served as chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus from 1999 to 2003, after founding chair Bernie Sanders, and was succeeded by Peter DeFazio.

Kucinich was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, despite Republican president George Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes.

=== Domestic policy voting record ===
In 2008, Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives against President George W. Bush for the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

Although his voting record was not always in line with that of the Democratic Party, on March 17, 2010, after being courted by President Barack Obama, his wife and others, Kucinich reluctantly agreed to vote with his colleagues for the Affordable Care Act without a public option component.

Kucinich criticized the flag-burning amendment and voted against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. His congressional voting record was strongly anti-abortion, although he has noted that he never supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion altogether. In 2003, however, he began describing himself as pro-abortion rights and said he had shifted away from his earlier position. Press releases indicated that he supported abortion rights, ending abstinence-only sex education and increasing the use of contraception to make abortion &quot;less necessary&quot; over time. His voting record since 2003 received mixed ratings from abortion rights groups.

== Presidential campaigns ==
=== 2004 ===
Kucinich was criticized during his 2004 campaign for changing his stance on the issue of abortion. His explanation was, &quot;I&#x27;ve always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women to be able to have an abortion if they need to protect their health. So when I saw the direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose.&quot;

On December 10, 2003, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced the removal of its correspondents from the campaigns of Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton. Previously critical of the limited coverage given his campaign, Kucinich characterized ABC&#x27;s decision as an example of media companies&#x27; power to shape campaigns by choosing which candidates to cover and questioned its timing, coming immediately after the debate. ABC News, while stating its commitment to give coverage to a wide range of candidates, argued that focusing more of its &quot;finite resources&quot; on the candidates most likely to win would best serve the public.

In the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination race, national polls consistently showed Kucinich&#x27;s support in single digits. In the Iowa caucuses, he finished fifth, receiving about 1% of the state delegates, far below the 15% threshold for receiving national delegates. He performed similarly in the New Hampshire primary, placing sixth among the seven candidates with 1% of the vote. In the Mini-Tuesday primaries, he finished near the bottom in most states. His best performance was in New Mexico, where he received over 5% of the vote but still no delegates. Kucinich&#x27;s best showing in any Democratic contest was in the February 24 Hawaii caucus, in which he won 31% of caucus participants, finishing second behind Senator John Kerry and winning Maui County, the only county Kucinich won in either of his presidential campaigns. He also had a double-digit showing in Maine on February 8, receiving 16% percent in the state&#x27;s caucus. On Super Tuesday, March 2, Kucinich had another strong showing in the Minnesota caucus, receiving 17% of the vote. In Ohio, he received 9%. Kucinich campaigned heavily in Oregon, spending 30 days there during the two months leading up to the state&#x27;s May 18 primary. He continued his campaign because &quot;the future direction of the Democratic Party has not yet been determined&quot; and chose to focus on Oregon &quot;because of its progressive tradition and its pioneering spirit.&quot; He won 16% of the vote.

Even after Kerry won enough delegates to secure the nomination, Kucinich continued to campaign until just before the convention, citing an effort to help shape the agenda of the Democratic Party. He was the last candidate to end his campaign. He endorsed Kerry on July 22, four days before the start of the Democratic National Convention.

=== 2008 ===


On December 11, 2006, in a speech at Cleveland City Hall, Kucinich announced he would seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2008.

Kucinich told his supporters in Iowa that if he did not appear on the second ballot in a caucus that they should back Barack Obama.

At an October 2007 debate, NBC&#x27;s Tim Russert cited a passage from a book by Shirley MacLaine in which she writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO. Asked if it was true, Kucinich confirmed it. In November 2007, Larry Flynt hosted a fundraiser for Kucinich that drew criticism from Flynt&#x27;s detractors. Campaign representatives declined to comment. Kucinich was endorsed by author Gore Vidal and actor Viggo Mortensen. In January 2008, he asked for a New Hampshire recount based on alleged discrepancies between the machine-counted ballots and the hand-counted ballots. He stated that he wanted to make sure &quot;100% of the voters had 100% of their votes counted.&quot;

In January 2008, Kucinich was excluded from a Democratic presidential debate on MSNBC due to his poor showing in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. A ruling that the debate could not go ahead without him was overturned on appeal. Later that month, Kucinich dropped out of the race and did not endorse any other candidate. He endorsed Barack Obama after Obama won the nomination.
On August 27, 2008, he delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention.

== Congressional campaigns ==
Until 2012, Kucinich was reelected to Congress by big margins in his strongly Democratic-leaning districts.

=== 2006 ===
Kucinich defeated a Democratic primary challenger by a wide margin and defeated Republican Mike Dovilla in the general election with 66% of the vote.

=== 2008 United States House of Representatives election in Ohio&#x27;s 10th District ===

His opponents included Cleveland City Councilman Joe Cimperman and North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O&#x27;Grady. In February 2008, Kucinich raised around $50,000 compared to Cimperman&#x27;s $228,000, but through a YouTube fund-raising campaign he managed to raise $700,000, surpassing Cimperman&#x27;s $487,000.

Cimperman, who was endorsed by the mayor of Cleveland and &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, criticized Kucinich for focusing too much on campaigning for president and not on the district. Kucinich accused Cimperman of representing corporate and real estate interests. Cimperman described Kucinich as an absentee congressman who failed to pass any major legislative initiatives in his 12-year House career. In an interview, Cimperman said he was tired of Kucinich and Cleveland being joke fodder for late-night talk-show hosts, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s time for him to go home.&quot; A Cimperman campaign ad stated that Kucinich had missed over 300 votes, but the actual number was 139. It was also suggested that Kucinich&#x27;s calls for universal health care and an immediate withdrawal from Iraq made him a thorn in the side of the Democrats&#x27; congressional leadership, as well as his refusal to pledge to support the eventual presidential nominee, which he later reconsidered.

Kucinich took part in a debate with the other primary challengers. Barbara Ferris criticized him for not bringing as much money back to the district as other area legislators and authoring just one bill that passed during his 12 years in Congress. Kucinich responded: &quot;It was a Republican Congress and there weren&#x27;t many Democrats passing meaningful legislation during a Republican Congress.&quot; He won the primary with 68,156 votes out of 135,589 cast, beating Cimperman 52% to 33%.

Kucinich defeated former state representative Jim Trakas in the November 4 general election with 157,268 votes, 57.02% of those cast. Trakas received 107,918 votes (39.13%).

=== 2010 United States House of Representatives election in Ohio&#x27;s 10th District ===

Kucinich defeated Republican nominee Peter J. Corrigan and Libertarian nominee Jeff Goggins in the November 2 general election with 101,343 votes, 53.1% of those cast.

=== 2012 United States House of Representatives election in Ohio&#x27;s 9th District ===

Redistricting after the 2010 census eliminated Kucinich&#x27;s district. The new map shifted the bulk of Kucinich&#x27;s territory, including his home, to the Toledo-based 9th District, represented since 1983 by fellow Democrat Marcy Kaptur. Kucinich had been endorsed by another House member, Barney Frank of Massachusetts. The two competed in the Democratic primary on March 6, with Graham Veysey, a small-business owner from Cleveland, also on the ballot. Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote to Kucinich&#x27;s 40%. The redrawn district contained roughly 60% of Kaptur&#x27;s former territory.

In the general election, with 73% of the vote, Kaptur won a 16th term against Republican Samuel &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; Wurzelbacher and Libertarian Sean Stipe.

Kucinich had been mentioned frequently as a possible 2012 candidate for Congress in Washington&#x27;s newly created 10th district, but he decided to retire from Congress when his term ended in January 2013.

===2024 campaign to represent Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district ===

In 2024, Kucinich announced his campaign to represent Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district as an independent. He placed third with 13% of the vote, losing to incumbent Republican Max Miller. This was the best result for an independent candidate running for Congress in Ohio since Jim Traficant&#x27;s 16% finish in 2010.

==Later political ventures==

===2018 gubernatorial campaign===

In January 2018, Kucinich announced his candidacy for governor of Ohio in the 2018 election. He was criticized for working as a Fox News contributor. Tara Samples, an Akron city councilwoman, was his running mate. Our Revolution, a grassroots progressive organization founded by Bernie Sanders, endorsed Kucinich, but Sanders did not. Kucinich lost the primary to Richard Cordray, 62.3% to 22.9%.

===2021 Cleveland mayor campaign===

In December 2020, Kucinich announced his candidacy for mayor of Cleveland in the 2021 election. Though seen as likely to qualify in the seven-way nonpartisan primary for the two runoff spots, Kucinich finished in third place with 16.54%.

===2024 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presidential campaign manager===

In May 2023, the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 2024 presidential campaign announced that Kucinich had been selected as its campaign manager. He served until October 2023, shortly after the campaign switched from Democratic to independent.

== Television pundit ==
In January 2013, Kucinich joined Fox News Channel as a regular contributor. He appeared on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and other Fox News shows. Kucinich quit Fox News in January 2018 as he announced plans to run for governor. Since running for governor, Kucinich has reappeared on the network, in 2019 discussing Democratic primary debates, and has appeared on Larry King&#x27;s &quot;PoliticKING&quot; program, speaking against the Democrats&#x27; push to impeach President Trump.

== Political positions ==
After being elected to Congress in 1996, Kucinich began to position himself on the left. Based on his voting record in Congress, the American Conservative Union (ACU) gave Kucinich a conservative rating of 9.73%, and for 2008, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) gave him a liberal rating of 95%. He was often regarded as one of the most liberal members of the United States House of Representatives. Describing his views in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m from the universal-health-care wing of the Democratic Party. I&#x27;m from the Roe v. Wade-litmus-test wing of the Democratic Party. I&#x27;m from the abolish-the-death-penalty wing of the Democratic Party.&quot;

=== Abortion ===
Until 2002, Kucinich&#x27;s voting record was strongly anti-abortion, but he maintained a pro-abortion rights stance thereafter. In 1996, he was quoted as saying that &quot;life begins at conception&quot;, and he voted in favor of banning partial birth abortion and preventing the transport of minors to undergo abortion procedures. He said in a 2003 interview that he had a &quot;journey&quot; on the abortion issue that &quot;caused me to break from a voting record that had not been pro-choice&quot;.

=== Attempted impeachment of George W. Bush ===
On June 10, 2008, Kucinich introduced 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush on the floor of the House of Representatives. On June 11, the resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

Calling it &quot;a sworn duty&quot; of Congress to act, co-sponsor Robert Wexler said, &quot;President Bush deliberately created a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people, and the charges detailed in this impeachment resolution indicate an unprecedented abuse of executive power.&quot; On July 10, 2008, Kucinich introduced an additional article of impeachment accusing Bush of misleading Congress into war. On July 14, 2008, Kucinich introduced a new resolution of impeachment against Bush, charging him with manufacturing evidence to sway public opinion in favor of the war in Iraq. This resolution was also sent to the judiciary committee.

=== Attempted impeachment of Dick Cheney ===

On April 17, 2007, Kucinich sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues saying that he planned to file an impeachment resolution against Dick Cheney, then Vice President of the United States. Kucinich planned to introduce the impeachment articles on April 24, 2007, but in light of Cheney&#x27;s visit to his doctor for an inspection of a blood clot, Kucinich postponed the press conference &quot;until the vice president&#x27;s condition is clarified.&quot;

Kucinich held a press conference on April 24, 2007, revealing House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Cheney. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq&#x27;s weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq&#x27;s connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence, and said, &quot;I believe the Vice President&#x27;s conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation. Today, I have introduced House Resolution 333, Articles of Impeachment Relating to Vice President Richard B. Cheney. I do so in defense of the rights of the American people to have a government that is honest and peaceful.&quot;

On November 6, 2007, Kucinich used special parliamentary procedure and moved for a vote on impeaching Cheney. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Pelosi opposed the measure and stood by previous comments that &quot;impeachment is not on our agenda&quot;, and they initially moved to table the bill. When that attempt failed, Hoyer moved to refer the bill to the House Judiciary Committee. That motion succeeded.

=== Barack Obama ===
In March 2011, Kucinich said that President Obama&#x27;s decision to approve air strikes against Gaddafi&#x27;s forces in the Libyan Civil War was an &quot;impeachable offense.&quot;

=== Cannabis ===
During his 2004 presidential campaign, Kucinich expressed support for a drug policy that &quot;sets reasonable boundaries for marijuana use by establishing guidelines similar to those already in place for alcohol&quot;. He stated: &quot;Most marijuana users do so responsibly, in a safe, recreational context. These people lead normal, productive lives–pursuing careers, raising families and participating in civic life.&quot; Kucinich also released a detailed plan for cannabis policy reform during his 2018 campaign for Ohio governor.

=== Civil liberties ===
Kucinich has opposed the USA PATRIOT Act since its inception. He voted against the act in 2001, and against its renewal in 2006. He voted for an amendment to the constitution outlawing flag burning and desecration, but later took the opposite stance, voting against a similar amendment in 2005.

In 2007, Kucinich voted to require the Department of Defense to present a detailed plan for transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

=== Donald Trump ===
Kucinich has praised and defended President Donald Trump in Fox News appearances. He praised Trump&#x27;s inaugural speech, calling it &quot;GREAT&quot; and a &quot;message of unity&quot;.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Kucinich &quot;was a rare left-wing voice attacking &#x27;the deep state&#x27; for undermining the president.&quot; On Sean Hannity&#x27;s show, Kucinich said he believed that a deep state intelligence community worked against Trump and that it was &quot;very dangerous to America&quot;, &quot;a threat to our republic&quot; and &quot;a clear and present danger to our way of life.&quot; In February 2017, Kucinich defended Michael Flynn, saying that the intelligence community had treated him unfairly; in December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Kucinich defended Trump&#x27;s claims that he was being wiretapped, saying that he himself had been wiretapped. He also defended Trump&#x27;s efforts to improve relations with Russia.

Kucinich criticized some House Democrats for attempting to start impeachment proceedings against Trump. He said, &quot;The Democratic Party had best be identified with something more than impeachment.&quot; He said that efforts to assess Trump&#x27;s mental and physical fitness to be president were &quot;destroying the party as an effective opposition.&quot;

After the January 6 United States Capitol attack that attempted to overturn Trump&#x27;s defeat, Kucinich denounced the storming as &quot;an affront to the U.S. Constitution&quot;.

=== Environment and energy ===
Kucinich had a 100% rating during 2005 and 2006 from the League of Conservation Voters, indicating pro-environment votes. He has said that clean water is &quot;a basic human right&quot;.

As mayor of Cleveland, Kucinich favored the city&#x27;s existing &quot;Municipal Light System&quot; and opposed construction of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant and Perry Nuclear Power Plant on Lake Erie. He opposed a planned regional radioactive waste dump, and has long advocated renewable energy and efficient energy use.

=== Fairness Doctrine ===
Kucinich was involved in efforts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he and other critics of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, Vermont&#x27;s independent Senator Bernie Sanders, and others have joined him in this effort. Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.

=== Foreign policy ===
Kucinich is a supporter of a non-interventionist foreign policy and has called war a profitable racket.

Kucinich voted against the authorization of military force against Iraq in 2002. He also voted consistently against funding the war.

In a visit to the rest of the Middle East in September 2007, Kucinich said he did not visit Iraq because &quot;I feel the United States is engaging in an illegal occupation.&quot;
Kucinich objected to the 2011 military intervention in Libya missile strikes and suggested they were impeachable offenses. He also asked why Democratic leaders didn&#x27;t object when Obama told them of his plan for US participation in enforcing the Libyan no-fly zone. He said Obama&#x27;s action in Libya was &quot;a grave decision that cannot be made by the president alone&quot;, and that failing to first seek Congress&#x27;s approval was unconstitutional.

On August 31, Al Jazeera reported that a document had been found in the Libyan intelligence agency&#x27;s headquarters that according to the author appeared to be a summary of a conversation between Kucinich and an intermediary for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in which Kucinich asks for information about the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC), possible links between it and al-Qaeda, and evidence of corruption, to lobby US lawmakers to put an end to NATO airstrikes and suspend their support for the NTC. It also listed information necessary to defend al-Islam against International Criminal Court war crimes charges. Kucinich defended himself in a message to &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot;, saying that the document was simply a summary of Kucinich&#x27;s public positions on the Libyan campaign by a Libyan bureaucrat who never consulted Kucinich. &quot;Al Jazeera found a document written by a Libyan bureaucrat to other Libyan bureaucrats. All it proves is that the Libyans were reading &quot;The Washington Post&quot;... Any implication I was doing anything other than trying to bring an end to an unauthorized war is fiction.&quot;

In March 2011, Kucinich criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s decision to participate in the NATO intervention in Libya without Congressional authorization. He also called it an &quot;indisputable fact&quot; that Obama&#x27;s decision was an impeachable offense since he believes the U.S. Constitution &quot;does not provide for the president to wage war any times he pleases&quot;, but he did not introduce a resolution to impeach Obama. In response, Libyan officials invited Kucinich to visit that country on a &quot;peace mission&quot;, but he declined, saying that he &quot;could not negotiate on behalf of the administration.&quot;

Kucinich was criticized for his visit to Syria in 2007 and praise of President Bashar al-Assad on Syrian national TV. He praised Syria for taking in Iraqi refugees. &quot;What most people are not aware of is that Syria has taken in more than 1.5 million Iraqi refugees,&quot; Kucinich said. &quot;The Syrian government has actually shown a lot of compassion in keeping its doors open, and being a host for so many refugees.&quot;

Kucinich has met with Assad on several occasions. He has supported Assad, citing him as a lesser evil in the Syrian Civil War. Asked by Tucker Carlson how he could defend a war criminal, Kucinich said the choice was to let ISIS take over Syria or &quot;try to stabilize the region and let the people of Syria make their own decisions about who their leaders are going to be&quot;. He helped Fox News get an interview with Assad.

In October 2016, Kucinich warned against a prospective United States military intervention against Russia in Syria. He argued that &quot;a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria&quot; and said that Russia was being demonized as part of a &quot;calculated plan to resurrect a for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination.&quot;

=== Guns ===
Kucinich is graded &quot;F&quot; by the NRA Political Victory Fund, indicating a pro-gun control voting record. He also received a 100% lifetime rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

=== Health care ===
Kucinich believes that health care is a &quot;right in a democratic society&quot;. He is a critic of the for-profit health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and is concerned about the large number of uninsured and underinsured in the United States. He contends that if the for-profit insurance system&#x27;s overhead, such as &quot;stock options, executive salaries, [and] advertising&quot;, were used for medically necessary care, there would be enough money in the system to cover everyone at no extra cost.

In July 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee approved an amendment by Kucinich to its version of the unsuccessful America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 by a vote of 27-19, with 14 Democrats and 13 Republicans voting for it. The amendment empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive the federal law that preempts state law on employee-related health care, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in response to state requests. It has been speculated that the amendment&#x27;s bipartisan support was for its appeal to states&#x27; rights in supporting progressive legislation. In the past, states attempting to enact single-payer reforms had been sued and stopped under ERISA. It has also been speculated that the law would open up vital new avenues for promoting and implementing a single-payer system, as newly unbound states would show single-payer&#x27;s success, just as Saskatchewan did for Canada. But the Kucinich Amendment was stripped from the merged House bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that it would have violated Obama&#x27;s promise that Americans who liked their health insurance could keep it.

In March 2010, Kucinich announced that he supported the Affordable Care Act, after previously indicating opposition. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, his switch was the first in a vital flurry of holdout representatives switching to yes votes.

=== LGBT rights ===
Kucinich supports same-sex marriage. He voted for the expansion of hate crime laws in the United States and against banning LGBT adoption in Washington, D.C.

=== Trade ===
Kucinich has consistently opposed free trade, claiming that it costs American jobs and enables abusive working conditions in other countries.

=== Youth rights ===
In a Democratic debate during the 2008 Presidential Election, Kucinich and Mike Gravel were the only two candidates to favor lowering the legal drinking age to 18. Kucinich also supported lowering the voting age to 16.

== Electoral history ==
== Recognition ==
In 2003, Kucinich received the Gandhi Peace Award, an annual award bestowed by the Religious Society of Friends-affiliated organization Promoting Enduring Peace. In 2010, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded him The US Peace Prize &quot;in recognition of his national leadership to prevent and end wars&quot;.

After Kucinich lost to Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 Democratic primary, Representative Keith Ellison said of Kucinich, &quot;At the end of the day, we&#x27;re really going to miss Dennis. Dennis is a transformative leader. He stood up and spoke eloquently, passionately about Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran. He was a consistent voice for peace... He almost didn&#x27;t vote for the health care bill because it wasn&#x27;t good enough.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kucinich was baptized a Roman Catholic. He married Sandra Lee McCarthy in 1977; they had a daughter, Jackie, in 1981 and divorced in 1986. He married his third wife, British citizen Elizabeth Harper, on August 21, 2005. They met while Harper was working as an assistant for the Chicago-based American Monetary Institute, which brought her to Kucinich&#x27;s House of Representatives office for a meeting. Kucinich, a vegan since 1995, is an advocate of veganism, like Elizabeth.

Kucinich was raised with four brothers and two sisters. Perry Kucinich, the youngest brother, died in December 2007. His youngest sister, Beth Ann Kucinich, died in November 2008.

In 2011, Kucinich sued a Capitol Hill cafeteria for damages after a 2008 incident in which he claimed to have suffered a severe injury biting into a sandwich and breaking a tooth on an olive pit. The broken tooth became infected, and complications led to three surgeries for dental work. The lawsuit, for $150,000 in punitive damages, was settled with the defendant agreeing to pay Kucinich&#x27;s costs.

<text>Muriel Fay Humphrey Brown (née Buck; February 20, 1912September 20, 1998) was an American politician who served as the second lady of the United States from 1965 to 1969, and as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota in 1978. She was married to the 38th vice president of the United States, Hubert Humphrey. Following her husband&#x27;s death, she was appointed to his seat in the United States Senate, serving for most of the year 1978, thus becoming the first woman to serve as a senator from Minnesota, and the only Second Lady of the United States to hold public office. After leaving office, she remarried and took the name Muriel Humphrey Brown.

== Early life and marriage ==
Humphrey was born Muriel Fay Buck on February 20, 1912, in Huron, South Dakota, daughter of Andrew E. Buck and his wife, the former Jessie Mae Pierce. She attended Huron College and met her future husband; Hubert Humphrey in 1934, when she was twenty-two years old and working as a bookkeeper. They married on September 3, 1936, saying, &quot;It was love at first waltz&quot;. After living with their daughter in South Dakota, she moved to the South to join her husband when he pursued a graduate degree at Louisiana State University, where she found work in the Department of Government as a typist.

She had four children: Hubert III, Nancy, Robert, and Douglas. The Humphreys built a home and moved to Waverly, a small village west of Minneapolis, in the mid-1950s and maintained it as their primary residence until Hubert Humphrey was elected vice president in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.

==Political life==
Muriel served as an informal adviser to her husband after he entered politics. His first office was mayor of Minneapolis. From there, he served three consecutive terms as senator from Minnesota. It was during his second Senatorial campaign that Muriel began making campaign appearances alongside her husband.

Hubert Humphrey ran for his party&#x27;s nomination in the Presidential primaries of 1960, losing to John F. Kennedy; during this campaign, Muriel made speeches for him in Wisconsin. Humphrey remained in the senate and President Lyndon B. Johnson chose him as his vice-presidential running mate in 1964. With Muriel often campaigning alongside her husband and being profiled favorably in US media, the ticket won the election. Hubert thereafter served as Vice President of the United States from January 1965 to January 1969.

As Second Lady of the United States, Muriel had a busy schedule of travel and involvement in various causes. A catalogue of her papers at the Minnesota Historical Society gives a clear sense of the breadth of activities. She served as a member of the President&#x27;s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities from 1966 to 1969, convened many meetings of women associated with the Democratic Party, and travelled extensively.

During her husband&#x27;s subsequent run for president in 1968, Muriel made a number of public appearances, garnering praise from President Johnson. After Hubert lost the 1968 election to former Vice President Richard M. Nixon, he made a decision which would ultimately lead to Muriel&#x27;s entry into politics: He chose to run for a US Senate seat from Minnesota in the 1970 elections. Hubert won the election and returned to the Senate in January 1971.

Hubert Humphrey died of bladder cancer on January 13, 1978. He was 66.
Muriel was nominated by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and subsequently appointed to the Senate vacancy by Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich, serving from January 25, 1978, to November 7, 1978, in the 95th Congress. She was the first spouse of a former vice president to serve in Congress as well as the first woman to represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate, preceding the Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith.

Muriel had years of experience as a public speaker, and was an active senator. According to Karina Karr, Humphrey was ostracised by the all-male Senate, but served on the Foreign Relations Committee and voted reliably to support the foreign policy of the Jimmy Carter administration. According to an official Congressional biographical summary, &quot;Muriel Humphrey pursued her own interests during her brief tenure, supporting an extension of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratification deadline and advocating several programs to benefit persons with mental disabilities.&quot;

Among the issues which she championed was public visibility for Down Syndrome, a topic she had become passionate about due to her granddaughter Victoria Solmonson&#x27;s condition. During her husband&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1967 and 1968, she visited facilities for people with Down Syndrome in Long Island and was featured by the New York Times. In 1970, she gave a speech on this topic which was reprinted in a prestigious medical journal. As a senator, she sponsored the Mental Health Advocacy Act of 1978.

After consulting with President Jimmy Carter, Muriel chose not to stand as a candidate for the 1978 United States Senate special election in Minnesota for the remaining term. &quot;It was the most challenging thing I&#x27;ve done in my whole life,&quot; she said.

Looking back at her political life, Humphrey reflected &quot;There&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been wanting to say for a long time. I&#x27;m a liberal and I&#x27;m proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.&quot; While in office, and after, she pressed for the right for women to choose to have an abortion and worked towards legislation for the rights of the mentally disabled.

==Second marriage==
In 1981, Humphrey married Max Brown, a friend from childhood. &quot;I don&#x27;t live a life of politics any more,&quot; she said after her second marriage. &quot;Max and I have so much fun. We have a wonderful companionship that Hubert and I didn&#x27;t have, couldn&#x27;t have. We were so busy and it was so official almost all the time.&quot; She died in 1998. Max Brown died in 2004 at the age of 93.
