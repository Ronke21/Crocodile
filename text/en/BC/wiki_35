<text>Stephen A. Ferrone (born 25 April 1950) is an English drummer. He is known as a member of the rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from 1994 to 2017, replacing original drummer Stan Lynch, and as part of the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of the Average White Band in the 1970s. Ferrone has recorded and performed with Michael Jackson, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Duran Duran, Stevie Nicks, Laura Pausini, Christine McVie, Rick James, Slash, Chaka Khan, Bee Gees, Scritti Politti, Aerosmith, Al Jarreau, Mick Jagger, Johnny Cash, Todd Rundgren and Pat Metheny. Ferrone also hosts &quot;The New Guy&quot; radio show on Sirius XM&#x27;s Tom Petty Radio.

==Musical career==
Ferrone played with the band Bloodstone, appearing on their 1975 album &quot;Riddle of the Sphinx&quot;. He then began playing with Brian Auger&#x27;s band Oblivion Express, which had previously featured drummer Robbie McIntosh.

McIntosh later joined the Average White Band, but just after releasing their first number-one album, he died of a heroin overdose. Ferrone was asked to join AWB in his place and stayed with them for the next eight years, recording and playing concert tours to support several hit albums, until AWB broke up in 1982.

Since appearing on Chaka Khan&#x27;s 1978 debut album, Ferrone went on to play on most of her subsequent albums in the 80s, including &quot;Naughty&quot; with former AWB band member Hamish Stuart. In 1985, Ferrone joined the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; house band and was there for the 1985–86 season. He contributed as session drummer for Duran Duran on the &quot;Notorious&quot;, &quot;Big Thing&quot;, &quot;Duran Duran&quot;, and &quot;Thank You&quot; albums. He also toured with Duran Duran on the Strange Behaviour Tour in support of &quot;Notorious&quot;. He also toured and recorded with Eric Clapton from 1986 to 1992. During rehearsals in London for the George Harrison tour, he played drums for Duran Duran at Abbey Road Studios and recorded &quot;Ordinary World.&quot; In 1991, Ferrone played drums on the George Harrison tour in Japan including three nights at the Tokyo Dome.

Ferrone met guitarist Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers when the two played a show with George Harrison as part of his Hari and the Hijack band at Royal Albert Hall. He became the band&#x27;s full-time drummer after the departure of original drummer Stan Lynch in 1994. Ferrone&#x27;s first album with the band was Tom Petty&#x27;s second solo outing &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, released that same year. His first live performance as a member of the Heartbreakers was in Louisville, Kentucky on 28 February 1995.

In November 2002, Ferrone set up Drumroll Studios in Burbank, California with financial advisor Alan Arora and the technical expertise of producer John Jones, with whom he had worked since Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary World&quot; in 1992. Later, they were joined by guitarist and producer Steve Postell. Together they recorded and produced albums and tracks for a variety of musical acts, as well as film and TV scores.

In 2010, Ferrone played on the eponymous first solo album by Slash, and joined the Italian band Pooh. He also worked on a collaborative project with composer and musician Eric Alexandrakis, guitarist and composer Warren Cuccurullo, and producer and songwriter Anthony J. Resta. Explaining the purpose of that project in a Modern Drummer news release, Alexandrakis said, &quot;The four of us decided to create a scoring collective to pursue scoring projects in TV themes, film and advertising.&quot; In August 2018, he was announced as drummer for Dire Straits Legacy prior to their first US tour, consisting of 10 dates.

On 10 July 2019, Ferrone was inducted into the Brighton Music Walk of Fame in his hometown of Brighton, England. That same year, he recorded session drums for Stroke 9&#x27;s studio album, &quot;Calafrio&quot;.

As of July 2024, Ferrone is on the road as the drummer for Mike Campbell&#x27;s solo project, The Dirty Knobs.

<text>Moschus () was an ancient Greek bucolic poet and student of the Alexandrian grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace. He was born at Syracuse, Magna Graecia, and flourished about 150 BC. Aside from his poetry, he was known for his grammatical work, nothing of which survives. 

== Works ==
His few surviving works consist of an epyllion, the &quot;Europa&quot;, on the myth of Europa, three bucolic fragments and a whole short bucolic poem &quot;Runaway Love&quot;, and an epigram in elegiac couplets. His surviving bucolic material (composed in the traditional dactylic hexameters and Doric dialect) is short on pastoral themes and is largely erotic and mythological; although this impression may be distorted by the paucity of evidence, it is also seen in the surviving bucolic of the generations after Moschus, including the work of Bion of Smyrna. Moschus&#x27; poetry is typically edited along with other bucolic poets, as in the commonly used Oxford text by A. S. F. Gow (1952), but the &quot;Europa&quot; has often received separate scholarly editions, as by Winfried Bühler (Wiesbaden 1960) and Malcolm Campbell (Hildesheim 1991). The epigram is also normally published with the edition by Maximos Planoudes of the Greek Anthology. 

=== Influence ===
The &quot;Europa&quot;, along with Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Hecale&quot; and such Latin examples as Catullus 64, is a major example of the Hellenistic phenomenon of the epyllion. Although it is hard to tell because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence, Moschus&#x27; influence on Greek bucolic poetry is likely to have been significant; the influence of &quot;Runaway Love&quot; is felt in Bion and other later bucolic poets. In later European literature his work was imitated or translated by such authors as Torquato Tasso and Ben Jonson. 

=== Apocrypha ===
Two other poems, attributed to him at one time or another but no longer thought to be his, are also commonly edited with his work. The best known is the &quot;Epitaph on Bion&quot; (i.e. Bion of Smyrna), which had a long history of influence on the pastoral lament for a poet (compare Milton&#x27;s &quot;Lycidas&quot;). The other is a miniature epic on Megara (the wife of Heracles), consisting of an epic dialogue between Heracles&#x27; mother and his wife on his absence.

<doc id="245383" wikidata="Q996129" url="?curid=245383" title="Cap d'Agde">
<text>Cap d&#x27;Agde () is a seaside resort on France&#x27;s Mediterranean coast. 
It is located in the commune of Agde, in the Hérault department within the region of Occitanie. 
Cap d&#x27;Agde was planned by architect Jean Le Couteur as part of one of the largest state-run development schemes for holidays in French history. It is also one of the cities in France where an increasing number of retirees reside since 1980.

Agde can be reached by TGV SNCF train direct from Paris or Lille or Geneva whilst the closest airport is Béziers-Cap-d&#x27;Agde airport, which runs direct budget airline services to the UK and Scandinavia. Agde is also served by Montpellier-Fréjorgues airport. Public transport (taxi or bus) is available between Agde and Cap d&#x27;Agde.

In place of the wine yard, it is now one of the largest marinas on the French Mediterranean. On June 4, 1971, the town was classified as a &quot;seaside resort&quot;.

== Development ==

Historically, this area was occupied by moorland and vineyards. and the only industry at the beginning of the 20th century was the distilleries for alcohol supply.

After immediate World War II, a naturist campsite (Camp Oltra) is set up in Port Lano (former Port Ambonne).

Due to 1960&#x27;s annual leave and the introduction of plastic instead of wood for the construction of sail and motor boats with the &quot;Plastic révolution&quot; there is a need for structured coastal development for all seashores in France.

A sea resort at Agde in Occitania was planned in the 1960s by the Mission Racine in the (insane with mosquitoes) old salt marsh in Cap d&#x27;Agde, the Luno lagoon, 1967 builder : SEBLI from Béziers and SOGEBI. The mass plan decided by Jean Le Couteur is in concentric circles of the different thematic zones (housing, parking, leisure, etc.) around the port. The SODEAL, the builder run by Agde, took place in 1990.

The A9 freeway was built from 1960 to 1978 serving Port Camargue to Argelès.

The mosquitoes were removed from lagoons by chemical spraying. In 2024 aerial and land sprays are still done.
The urbanization mission with its architectural rules came to an end in 1983.
By the 1960s, buildings were small houses typically used by locals on weekends, among which the winegrowers&#x27; lean-tos remained. Wine  production has plummeted since the sea-resort was planned,  and the traditional piquette is no longer an economics answer.

If in Grau there was a start of tourist activity at the beginning of the 20th century with for example permission for casino gambling in 2 places, the cape with the exception of a winery and a farm among small lots belonging to persons there not residing, plus a temporary exploitation of salt marshes at the beginning of the century, and as forever fishing by small boats with a small home port, the cape was mostly ininhabited. At that time, the State carried out expropriations in Cap d&#x27;Agde to avoid land speculation while the general fact was the practice of illegal occupations, including on the islands.

The first urban plan for Cap d&#x27;Agde was to stabilize sand with plants (pines, eucalyptus, coconuts, date palms and neriums), build dunes against wind and shore rains, and excavate a grand marina for sailing boats. The building of houses started 5 years later, with a subdivision (plat), and flats in the housing estate near the port and the shore (sea side). Numerous circular car parks have been set up for access to the beaches. They have been planted with tamarisk and pine trees. The mostly winding boulevards that connect the residences are lined with eleagnus or oleanders, as a distinct sign the middle strip is planted with large trees of a specific type.

Due to the German occupation, anti-landing mines were placed on the beaches (particularly at the Mole).
Nowadays, the Landing Memorial 1980 allows remembrance on its hill, it is the place where we have the best view of the Pyrenees in the distance and of the entire coastline between Spain and Sète.

In 1976 Richelieu-Rochelongue (in the extension to the South of the marina) , but also the urbanization of Mont Saint-Martin is designed.

And if the last vineyard of Bagnas is now very small below Château Maraval with the Meyer distillery in ruins, walking in is a planned tourist-office leisure nowadays; This &quot;Wine tourism&quot; has been in full development for several years. The main tourist festival is in the 21st century the Vinocap trade show.

Cars and motorcycle are the folkloric elements for the summer. Bikers with their motorcycles are blessed in a ceremony by a priest in the central plaza.
Streets are labyrinthine in the 1960s&#x27; urban plan, shaped with numerous central parking places serving points of interest.

After Lano set up, between Le Môle beach and the Memorial cape, the urbanization of the 1980s took place, (in 1983 Thalacap, a thalassotherapy institute opened in a hotel -it disappeared in 2006-).

On the 2000s&#x27; a new Cap d&#x27;Agde center was designed, with no more &quot;Mediterranean style&quot; as defined in the &quot;Mission Racine&quot;, but the &quot;International Style&quot; with a new street Rambla style. And this appears in new Congress Palace and the Casino Barrière facades with their rhythmic perforated metal facades; To improve the value of the city with the aim of attracting more prosperous people to live there.

Golf (2013) and municipal campsites (2022) change management providers.

On the 4 main beaches, lifeguards are on duty at several stations, during summer most of the day.
== Marinas ==
There are 2 marinas in Cap d&#x27;Agde, many slipways are along the shore mainly for little boats.

=== Marina Centre Cap ===





The initial marshland was formed by the flow of water from the Monts d&#x27;Agde. But the place became a salt producing place in 1910s&#x27;. It has been replaced by the marina. &quot;Its a base for Mediterranean cruises to Spain (50 miles), the Balearics (200 miles) or Corsica (230 miles)&quot;. The marina is composed with one entrance, 10 basins forming a 35-hectares body of water dredged to 3 m.; attached to islands in administratively two parts, the public-accessible and not accessible ones.
The part between accessible Ile des Loisirs and non-accessible Ile St Martin is the part of the harbor where the boat&#x27;s mooring ring to the quay is private and sold with the villa or apartment, a little part. 
The part between Ile St Martin and accessible Ile des Pêcheurs is the main part of the harbor where the boat&#x27;s mooring ring is rented to the harbor master. Composed of 3100 mooring rings, this location is a home port with a small transit portion.
Exists : &quot;
* 6 sanitary blocks (toilets, showers, washbasins) with reserved access (electronic key).
* Reserved parking for yachtsmen.
* Fresh water and electricity (220 V mono and 380 V tri) at quayside.
* Secure pontoons (electronic key access): berths are equipped with catways and, for larger units, with piles or deadbeds.
* Special berths for multihulls.
* 2 slipways (Avant Port).
* European-standard waste disposal center.&quot;.
The walk along the quays is one of the attractions for the shops and café restaurants. Just behind the waterfront there are grocery stores for everyday life.

But a significant part of the population (holiday or annually for retirees) resides in that area. The first buildings for annual occupancy were built on the slope of the Bay of Le Môle, and include low-cost housing, which was done at the same time of the marina buildings with the landmark tower, the campanile. Expansion has taken place on both sides of this new center, with the last developments towards the old port taking place in the 1990s, which is now occupied and owned mainly by retirees, an evolution of the 1960 urban plan that only took working people into account; this element led to the design of the new Cap center after 2000, with larger and more expensive apartments.
=== Marina Port Lano ===

Near the naturist camp, the marina has about 60 places for boats up to in length and a large boat yard. Its stocks cabin cruisers, with racks and elevator for motorboats (no sail baoats).


== Recreational activities ==
Most of them are located in commercial parks with commercial purposes, others are necessary for the local population while others have free entry and an educational purpose.


Underwater fishing has taken place since the creation of Cap d&#x27;Agde in the nearby seagrass beds.

Leisure areas have been created, such as the Ile des Loisirs (designed in 1976)in the main marina (an amusement park, nightclubs and, in the past, a casino (1970s)).
The Aqualand day-swimming theme park was one of the first of its kind (1984).

Between Cap d&#x27;Agde and Grau d&#x27;Agde, the Centre Aquatique de l&#x27;Archipel (&quot;Cité de l&#x27;Eau&quot;), a 21st-century construction by the town and the Hérault Méditerranée urban community.

The former tennis camp was created by Pierre Barthès (on his grand&#x27;mother field) whilst Racine plan is beginning, in the first 1970s&#x27;. It became since the International Tennis Center. In 1978 a club house and an hotel are built for the international competition. Its modern padel hall opened in 2022 after the takeover by SODEAL the developer, it replaces the hangar.
Around the Tennis Camp, in its vicinity the tennis courts was the major theme for the development of housing estates, some exists near La Roquille beach.
Golf practice is an activity that was set up in 1980s. Its extension (27 holes) was inaugurated in 2013.

Les Arènes du Cap offers a variety of shows (and toro-pools during the summer season).

Since 2003 the cultural season of the city of Agde opens with a film festival to which entry is free, it has moved from the old congress center to the new center of the &quot;Rembla du Soleil&quot;.

Outdoor activities are available in the Bagnas reserve, including hiking.

The underwater trails have existed to discover underwater fauna since the establishment of the marina in 1967 with its marine protected area. 
In 2023, opened to public, an architecturally interesting floating Maison de la Mer was built in entrance of marina bassin n°1 to educationally illustrate the considerable connection between the shore and the salt water.


== Museum ==

The Musée de l&#x27;Ephèbe houses the bronze nude statue known as &quot;The Youth of Agde&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;Ephèbe d&#x27;Agde&quot;). The statue was discovered in the river Hérault and was housed in the Louvre Museum prior to suitable facilities being made available in Cap d&#x27;Agde to house it.
== Elementary school ==
In the same way and for the same reasons as for Grau d&#x27;Agde and for Tamarissière,
in 1956 mayor Louis Vallière will open in the renovated [former farm] located on the Clape estate the first school in Cap d&#x27;Agde (where the Musée de l&#x27;Ephèbe is now located).
Urban planners have forecast 2,500 sedentary residents at Cap d&#x27;Agde. Due to the particular nature of the environment, the project will be managed by SEBLI and the chosen architect, the Cap d&#x27;Agde architect Jean Lecouteur. Due to Museum construction, the &quot;Jules Verne&quot; Elementary school is built between 1976 and 1980.

== Arena ==
Aside the antique villa d&#x27;Ambonne, on the land of the old farm, à completely new project for an arena in Agde, in use since 1974, a concrete building for open air shows.
== Church Saint-Benoît ==
A Catholic church was built on a model adapted to the seasonal affluence: its right wing is formed by high bay windows that open onto a courtyard in which pews are placed for the faithful. The rite is ecumenical. Church was built right next to the ruins of the Villa Embonne (a wheat mill), the first Greek settlement (next to the contemporan arena and Clape museum).

== Naturist village ==
Cap d&#x27;Agde has a large naturist resort. The naturist village encompasses a significant area along the eastern coast of Cap d&#x27;Agde.() It is built on private land, replaces the former campsite. It does not follow municipal planning directives of the Mission Racine : ) which exclude large architectural complexes with no local architecture references for roof or walls. It is fenced-off with an entrance gate, and it is also accessible along the public beach from the north. It is a self-contained town (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Naked City&quot;), where nudity is both legal and common.

The Naturist Village is becoming a hotspot for swingers and libertines. It has a beach, a large marina, places for 2,500 campers, apartment complexes, hotel, shops, restaurants, night clubs, bars, post office, bank, ATMs, launderettes, hairdressers, and other facilities.

=== History of local naturism ===
The land adjoining the long sandy beach at Cap d&#x27;Agde was owned for many years by the winemaker Oltra family who farmed the olive groves behind the sand dunes adjoining the beach. After World War II, in 1950&#x27;s, the Oltra brothers noticed that people were coming in increasing numbers to camp on their land, for bathing and sunbathing nude.

The Oltra brothers began to formalise arrangements for campers on their land, and this subsequently led to the creation of a caravanning and camping resort, called the &#x27;Oltra Club&#x27;. The camp grew increasingly popular, especially with young families and German and Dutch tourists.

In 1960s the government of Georges Pompidou drew up plans for the development of the Languedoc-Roussillon coastline. Naturism initially had no part in these proposals, but Paul René Oltra, one of the brothers, persuaded the authorities to include plans for a naturist resort at Cap d&#x27;Agde. In 1973 the beach was officially designated as a naturist beach. Regulations for the new resort were also promulgated. The Naturist Village would be a place where voyeurs and exhibitionists would not be welcome.

=== Early developments ===
The first development was the construction of flats, shops and pools at Port Nature and Port Ambonne. Later, Heliopolis and Port Venus were built and Port Nature was considerably extended. The flats were sold and the owners often let them when they did not require them for their own use. The Naturist Village became a controlled zone during the season with regulated access. Everyone entering was informed of the regulations and required to comply with them.

=== The 1980s ===
By the early 1980s, the Naturist Village was reaching the limit of its development. Many shops and commercial premises remained empty, ready for sale or lease. The election of the government of François Mitterrand was to herald a cooling off of the French economy which lasted well into the following decade. During this time the Naturist Village continued to prove a popular resort and it developed a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. There were so many German visitors that the Post Office even had a designated postbox for letters and postcards being sent to Germany.

=== The present position ===
The naturist village is also becoming a hotspot for swingers and libertines, with sex-shops and swinger clubs. The swingers are also active on the naturist beaches, which has made many naturist tourists change destination to family friendly naturist resorts. The nickames is &quot;La baie des cochons&quot;.

The naturist village has rules which require nudity as the norm, and which ban photography, the wearing of provocative clothing and the display of indecent items. In 2008, signs were put on display on the beach warning against lewd behaviour. The nightlife centres around clubs and venues. Many open only at certain times of the year. On 23 November 2008, the British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; suggested that fires at three swingers clubs were started by hard-line naturists, or &#x27;nudist mullahs&#x27;, who oppose the &quot;echangistes&quot; or libertines.

In 2009, René Oltra, the company that bears the name of the resort&#x27;s original promoter, required that visitors to its campsite, villas and flats belong to a naturist organisation. However, because of abuses, Cap d&#x27;Agde is no longer registered with or supported by the &quot;Fédération Française de Naturisme&quot;.

In December 2009, the local authority proposed renovations that would make the village almost traffic-free. These renovations involved the construction of tree-lined walkways and promenades, a raised promenade by the beach, and a hotel. Work was to start in early 2012. Other plans included the renovation of buildings and the construction of new façades.

The naturist village creates employment and revenue in a region of France less affluent than others. It creates income for the local authority through property taxes and admission prices.

In September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic it was reported that a testing station outside the village found 30% of 800 naturists tested positive for COVID-19. Under normal circumstances at the time—much reduced during the pandemic–the village itself held 10,000 campsite pitches and 15,000 beds, a population density seven times greater than nearby Montpellier.

=== Naturist beach ===


The naturist beach (where nudity is technically mandatory) has a length of about and is about wide. Sand and water are of good quality, varying from . Free access to the nudist part is possible, coming from the north of the beach but impossible from the south with the Port Lano entrance. Two security posts feature police and medical facilities. Six restaurants border the southern end of the nude beach. Only one restaurant is available towards the northern end. Even though Cap d&#x27;Agde is in France, most service staff speak English.

<text>The Menin Gate (), officially the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing, is a war memorial in Ypres, Belgium, dedicated to the British and Commonwealth soldiers who were killed in the Ypres Salient of World War I and whose graves are unknown. The memorial is located at the eastern exit of the town and marks the starting point for one of the main roads that led Allied soldiers to the front line.

Designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and built by the Imperial War Graves Commission (since renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Menin Gate Memorial was unveiled on 24 July 1927. In early 2023, the monument was closed for extensive restoration works, expected to be completed in time for the memorial&#x27;s centenary in 2027.

==Background==
In medieval times, the original narrow gateway on the eastern wall of Ypres was called the Hangoartpoort, &quot;poort&quot; being the Dutch word for gate. During the 17th and 18th centuries, while under the occupation of the Habsburgs and the French, the city was increasingly fortified. Major works were completed at the end of the 17th century by the French military engineer Sebastien Le Prestre, Seigneur de Vauban. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the eastern exit simply cut through the remains of the ramparts and crossed a moat. The gateway was by this time known as the Menenpoort, or Menin Gate in English, because the road leading through the gateway led to the small town of Menen.

Ypres occupied a strategic position during the First World War because it stood in the path of Germany&#x27;s planned sweep across the rest of Belgium, as had been called for in the Schlieffen Plan. By October 1914, the much battered Belgian Army broke the dykes on the Yser River to the north of the City to keep the western tip of Belgium out of German hands. Ypres, being the centre of a road network, anchored one end of this defensive feature and was also essential for the Germans if they wanted to take the Channel Ports through which British support was flooding into France. For the Allies, Ypres was also important because it eventually became the last major Belgian town that was not under German control.

The importance of the town is reflected in the five major battles that occurred around it during the war. During the First Battle of Ypres the Allies halted the German Army&#x27;s advance to the east of the city. The German army eventually surrounded the city on three sides, bombarding it throughout much of the war. The Second Battle of Ypres marked a second German attempt to take the city in April 1915. The third battle is more commonly referred to as Passchendaele, but this 1917 battle was a complex five-month engagement. The fourth and fifth battles occurred during 1918.

British and Commonwealth soldiers often passed through the Menenpoort on their way to the front lines with some 300,000 of them being killed in the Ypres Salient. 90,000 of these soldiers have no known graves.

From September to November 1915, the British 177th Tunnelling Company built tunnelled dugouts in the city ramparts near the Menin Gate. These were the first British tunnelled dugouts in the Ypres Salient.

The carved limestone lions adorning the original gate were damaged by shellfire, and were donated to the Australian War Memorial by the Mayor of Ypres in 1936. They were restored in 1987, and currently reside at the entrance to that Memorial, so that all visitors to the Memorial pass between them. Replicas of the original Menin gate lions now sit at the entrance of the original gate in Ypres, a gift by the Australian government in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Australians serving in Flanders during the First World War.

==Memorial==

Reginald Blomfield&#x27;s triumphal arch, designed in 1921, is the entry to the barrel-vaulted passage for traffic through the mausoleum that honours the Missing, who have no known graves. The patient lion on the top is the lion of Britain but also the lion of Flanders. It was chosen to be a memorial as it was the closest gate of the town to the fighting, and so Allied Troops would have marched past it on their way to fight. Actually, most troops passed out of the other gates of Ypres, as the Menin Gate was too dangerous due to shellfire.

Its large &quot;Hall of Memory&quot; contains names on stone panels of 54,395 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the Salient but whose bodies have never been identified or found. On completion of the memorial, it was discovered to be too small to contain all the names as originally planned. An arbitrary cut-off point of 15 August 1917 was chosen and the names of 34,984 UK missing after this date were inscribed on the Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing instead. The Menin Gate Memorial does not list the names of the missing of New Zealand and Newfoundland soldiers, who are instead honoured on separate memorials.
The inscription inside the archway is similar to the one at Tyne Cot, with the addition of a prefatory Latin phrase: &quot;&quot;Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam&quot;, a centuries-old traditional text meaning &#x27;To the greater glory of God&#x27;. – Here are recorded names of officers and men who fell in Ypres Salient, but to whom the fortune of war denied the known and honoured burial given to their comrades in death&quot;. This inscription, proposed by Rudyard Kipling, is matched by the main overhead inscription on both the east- and west-facing façades of the arch, which he personally composed. On the opposite side of the archway to that inscription is the shorter dedication: &quot;They shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away&quot;. There are also Latin inscriptions set in circular panels either side of the archway, on both the east and west sides: &quot;Pro Patria&quot; and &quot;Pro Rege&quot; (&#x27;For Country&#x27; and &#x27;For King&#x27;). A French inscription mentions the citizens of Ypres: &quot;Erigé par les nations de l&#x27;Empire Britannique en l&#x27;honneur de leurs morts ce monument est offert aux citoyens d&#x27;Ypres pour l&#x27;ornement de leur cité et en commémoration des jours où l&#x27;Armée Britannique l&#x27;a défendue contre l&#x27;envahisseur&quot;, which translated into English means: &quot;Erected by the nations of the British Empire in honour of their dead, this monument is offered to the citizens of Ypres for the ornament of their city and in commemoration of the days where the British Army defended it against the invader.&quot;

Reaction to the Menin Gate, the first of the Imperial (now Commonwealth) War Graves Commission&#x27;s Memorials to the Missing, ranged from its condemnation by the war poet Siegfried Sassoon, to praise by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. Sassoon described the Menin Gate in his poem &#x27;On Passing the New Menin Gate&#x27;, saying that the dead of the Ypres Salient would &quot;deride this sepulchre of crime&quot;. Zweig, in contrast, praised the simplicity of the memorial, and lack of overt triumphalism, and said that it was &quot;more impressive than any triumphal arch or monument to victory that I have ever seen&quot;. Blomfield himself said that this work of his was one of three that he wanted to be remembered by.

To this day, the remains of missing soldiers are still found from time to time in the countryside around the town of Ypres. Typically, such finds are made during building work or road-mending activities. Any human remains discovered receive a proper burial in one of the war cemeteries in the region. If the remains can be identified, the relevant name is removed from the Menin Gate.

==&quot;Last Post&quot; ceremony==

Following the Menin Gate Memorial opening in 1927, the citizens of Ypres wanted to express their gratitude towards those who had given their lives for Belgium&#x27;s freedom. Hence every evening at 20:00, buglers from the Last Post Association close the road which passes under the memorial and sound the &quot;Last Post&quot;. Except for the occupation by the Germans in World War II when the daily ceremony was conducted at Brookwood Military Cemetery, in Surrey, England, this ceremony has been carried on uninterrupted since 2 July 1928. On the evening that Polish forces liberated Ypres in the Second World War, on 6 September 1944 the ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate despite the fact that heavy fighting was still taking place in other parts of the town.

During an extended version of the ceremony, individuals or groups may lay a wreath to commemorate the fallen. Bands, choirs and military units from around the world may also apply to participate in the ceremonies. This extended version of the ceremony also starts at 20:00, but lasts longer than the normal ceremony, when only the Last Post is played. The Last Post Association is an independent, voluntary, non-profit-making organisation. It was the Association that first founded the Last Post Ceremony back in 1928, and it is the Association that is still responsible for the day-to-day organisation of this unique act of homage. It also administers the Last Post Fund, which provides the financial resources necessary to support the ceremony. It is a tradition that the Buglers of the Association should wear the uniform of the local volunteer Fire Brigade, of which they are all required to become members.

The Last Post was a bugle call played in the British Army (and in the armies of many other lands) to mark the end of the day&#x27;s labours and the onset of the night&#x27;s rest. In the context of the Last Post ceremony (and in the broader context of remembrance), it has come to represent a final farewell to the fallen at the end of their earthly labours and at the onset of their eternal rest.

Similarly, the Reveille was a bugle call played at the beginning of the day, to rouse the troops from slumber and to call them to their duties. In the context of the Last Post ceremony (and in the broader context of remembrance), the Reveille symbolises not only a return to daily life at the end of the act of homage, but also the ultimate resurrection of the fallen on the Day of Judgement. Schedules are available on the Last Post website.

==In art==
&quot;Menin Gate at Midnight&quot; (also known as &quot;Ghosts of Menin Gate&quot;) is a 1927 painting by Australian artist Will Longstaff. The painting depicts a host of ghostly soldiers marching across a field in front of the Menin Gate war memorial. The painting is part of the collection of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Other memorials==
On the city walls near the Menin Gate are further memorials to Allied soldiers who fought and died at Ypres, the most notable being those to the Gurkhas and Indian soldiers.

<text>A stealth game is a type of video game in which the player primarily uses &quot;stealth&quot; to avoid or overcome opponents. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, sneaking, or using disguises. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but rewarding the player for greater use of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism, and rogue themes, with protagonists that are special forces operatives, special agents, secret agents, thieves, ninjas, or assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and also platformers.

Elements of &quot;stealth&quot; gameplay, by way of avoiding confrontation with enemies, can be attributed to a diverse range of games, including &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). Early maze games have been credited with spawning the genre, including &quot;Manbiki Shounen&quot; (1979), &quot;Lupin III&quot; (1980), &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; (1981), &quot;005&quot; (1981) and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; (1987). The genre became a mainstream success in 1998, with &quot;&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. They were followed by later releases, like &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;.

==Definition==
Unlike most action games, stealth games challenge the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay elements of the modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize making noise, and strike enemies from the shadows and behind. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, sometimes referred to as &quot;ghosting&quot; is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may be the only way to successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or in shadows, and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they may be able to hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does trial-and-error. Some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill. Early on in the development of the stealth genre these games were referred to as &quot;sneak &#x27;em up&quot; games.

==Game design==

When hiding in the dark is a gameplay element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players must be able to hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.

In order for a game to include stealth gameplay, the knowledge of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies&#x27; reactions to the effects of the player&#x27;s actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI&#x27;s movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome their adversaries.

One staple of many stealth games is an alarm phase or an alert phase, in which enemies more aggressively seek out the player character. Players can evade capture or engage in combat. This mechanic can also be used to increase difficulty over the course of the game, with missions that end immediately when the alarm phase is activated.

Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player.

While early stealth games relied on small maps and simple hitboxes, 3D stealth games have introduced more complex environments. Modern stealth games often give players the ability to quickly climb or maneuver objects, take cover with hotkeys, or mark a series of enemies for attack.

==History==

=== Early developments: 1979–1997 ===
According to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s John Szczepaniak, the first stealth game was &quot;Manbiki Shounen&quot; (&quot;Shoplifting Boy&quot;), published in November 1979. Published as a type-in program for the PET 2001 in &quot;RAM&quot; magazine in February 1980, it was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki and involves a boy entering a convenience store and attempting to shoplift by stealing &quot;$&quot; symbols while avoiding the line-of-sight detection of the owner. If caught, the player is led away by the police. Suzuki presented the game to developer Taito, which used it as inspiration for their similar stealth arcade game, &quot;Lupin III&quot; (based on the manga and anime of the same name), released in April 1980. In November 1980, Suzuki developed a sequel, &quot;Manbiki Shoujo&quot; (&quot;Shoplifting Girl&quot;).

&quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, originally available in 1981, employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and a greater emphasis on disguising in enemy uniform. id Software&#x27;s updated 1992 remake &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was originally going to feature some of the original&#x27;s stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. As a result of these changes, &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; would instead pave the way for later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.

In 1981, Sega released an arcade game called &quot;005&quot; in which the player&#x27;s mission is to take a briefcase of secret documents to a waiting helicopter while avoiding enemy flashlights and use boxes as hiding spots. &quot;005&quot; holds the Guinness World Record for being the first stealth game. Mindscape&#x27;s &quot;Infiltrator&quot;, released in 1986, combined a flight simulator with a stealth-based &quot;ground mission&quot;. In this ground mission, the protagonist attempts to sneak into enemy territory using false IDs to avoid detection and knock-out gas to incapacitate enemies. The goal of this mission is to photograph secret documents while avoiding alarms.

Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, released in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, and was the first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. &quot;Metal Gear&quot; placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use hand-to-hand combat to fight enemies. In 1988, Infogrames published &quot;Hostages,&quot; sometimes known as &quot;Rescue: The Embassy Mission&quot;. One of the game&#x27;s three main segments required players to evade searchlights by rolling and ducking into doorways. &quot;Gamestop&quot; has observed that the game &quot;set important grounds and ideas for future stealth/tactical shooters,&quot; noting the game&#x27;s use of time limits, cover mechanics, and tests of reflexes.

The sequel &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; was released in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and right to see diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain on the lookout for some time after losing sight of the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics. 

===Establishing a genre: 1998–2002===
Although stealth gameplay had appeared in previous games, 1998 is seen as a turning point in gaming history because of the release of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The ninja-themed &quot;Tenchu: Stealth Assassins&quot; was the first 3D stealth based-game. Months later, the highly anticipated &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; transformed its modestly successful franchise into a mainstream success. The increased power of the PlayStation console over previous platforms allowed for greater immersion in terms of both story and game environment. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; has been credited with popularizing the stealth genre. &quot;Thief: The Dark Project&quot; is also credited as a pioneer of the genre. It was the first stealth game using the first-person perspective, dubbed a &quot;first-person sneaker&quot;. Among its contributions to the stealth game was the impact of light and dark areas, the latter which could be used for concealment, and the sound design approach that allowed players to track the movement of unseen enemies, while at the same time making the player-character&#x27;s movement across certain surfaces louder, such as on stone, than on other surfaces, like carpetting, and helping in their stealth.

With further releases, many games in the genre drifted towards action by allowing the option of direct confrontations. The &quot;Hitman&quot; series, the first installment of which was released in 2000, allowed this play style, but rewarded the player for stealthy and elaborate assassination of antagonists. &quot;&quot;, the first of the series, was the first 3D game to employ the genre&#x27;s device of disguises. &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot;, an espionage themed parody also released in 2000, again allowed the player to combine or choose between stealth and overt violence. In 2000, the first-person action role-playing game &quot;Deus Ex&quot; also allowed the player the choice of taking a stealth approach. A USA Today reviewer found &quot;At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is pureed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth.&quot;

1998 also saw the release of &quot;&quot;, a real-time strategy game with heavy stealth gameplay. Players control a team of several soldiers, each with different limited sets of abilities. Missions are completed by navigating or clearing densely layered enemies patrols with &quot;vision cones&quot;, similar to the Soliton radar in Metal Gear Solid. The game is recognized for its difficulty, demanding precision and memorization of hot keys. &quot;Commandos&quot; gave rise to other sequels along with third-party clones such as the &quot;Desperados&quot; series and &quot;Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood&quot;.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, released 2001 for the PlayStation 2, further evolved the stealth gameplay series. It featured an array of new abilities, including &quot;leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers,&quot; and sneaking up behind enemies to &quot;hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition.&quot; &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; holds a Guinness World Record for being the first stealth game to feature collective artificial intelligence. &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; sold 7 million units in sales, followed by &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; with 6 million units.

===Later developments: 2002–2012===

After the mainstream success of the genre, stealth elements became increasingly incorporated into a wide range of video games, with numerous action games using stealth elements in some way or another. In 2002, the first installment of the Tom Clancy licensed &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series was released, which attempted to add more realism to the stealth genre both in terms of graphics and in-game equipment. If the player is discovered in &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, the guards will often raise a general alarm which can cause a difficulty spike or even result in automatic mission failure. Clint Hocking, who worked as a level designer for &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, noted that this mechanic was in place at this point because the gameplay developers could not easily implement alternative player actions in the case of such detection; for example, on detection, a real agent may react by subduing the agent that found them, but this was not possible to program in at this point in time. Hocking recognized this would be frustrating to the player and would remain an issue with stealth games for about a decade. In addition, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; was notable for its state of the art graphics, including dynamic lighting and shadows. Like &quot;Thief&quot;, Splinter Cell featured a visibility meter which determined how much light was falling on the character. These effects not only contributed to the atmosphere of the game, but dynamically affected in which areas the player could hide. The 2004 sequel, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow&quot;, added a multiplayer component to the stealth genre.

The growth of the genre also led to the production of a number of E-rated stealth platformers aimed at younger audiences, most notably &quot;Sly Cooper&quot;, a cel-shaded game released in 2002. Other related games include 2001 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; game &quot;Sheep, Dog &#x27;n&#x27; Wolf&quot; and the 2000 movie tie-in game &quot;The Grinch.&quot; Later, in 2005, &quot;Ape Escape 3&quot; featured a mini-game based on the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series.

Developers continued to meld stealth with other genres. 2003&#x27;s &quot;Siren&quot; combined the survival horror genre with the stealth genre. Its sequel would later be released in 2006, with refined game mechanics and expanded difficulty options. &quot;Manhunt&quot; employed a snuff movie theme and allowed the player to kill antagonists with varying levels of violence, dependent on how much time was spent sneaking behind them. It was the first to show visual executions in the genre. The following year, Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; combined the stealth gameplay of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series with turn-based strategy and tactical role-playing game elements as well as card battle elements from Konami&#x27;s own &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; games.
In 2004, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; introduced camouflage to the genre. Set in a jungle, the game emphasized infiltration in a natural environment, along with survival aspects such as food capture, healing and close-quarters combat. The game was also notable for its infamous stealth battle with a sniper, in which the player confronts the nearly invisible enemy in a boss fight that can take hours to complete. The following year, the updated version &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence&quot; added an online multiplayer mode to the game with stealth elements.

Another 2004 release was &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay&quot;, based on the &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; series of movies. The game follows the character of Riddick as he attempts to escape from prison. Action and stealth gaming are combined seamlessly by allowing the character to hide, sneak, or fight his way past most situations. The game was critically acclaimed, and was followed with &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena&quot; in 2009.

&quot;&quot; released in 2006 and introduced a &quot;notoriety&quot; system where the player&#x27;s actions in missions affect the difficulty of the stealth gameplay. If Agent 47 is recorded by camera surveillance or witnessed committing a crime, his notoriety will rise and NPCs will be able to spot him more easily in later missions. Conversely eliminating witnesses, destroying surveillance footage or bribing officials will reduce notoriety.

In 2007, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; employed a social element to the stealth game, where the player is able to hide among crowds of civilians by taking care to blend in. Stealth elements were incorporated into Crytek&#x27;s open world first-person shooter &quot;Crysis&quot;, multiplayer first-person shooter &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, and first-person role-playing game &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; included a stealth mission called &quot;All Ghillied Up&quot; which has been considered one of greatest levels in video game history by critics.

Also in 2007, Ben Yahtzee Croshaw published &quot;Trilby: The Art of Theft&quot;, one of the first indie stealth games. The game features a rudimentary engine built in Adventure Game Studio. Because of this restricted approach, the game&#x27;s maps are largely static building cutaways. Trilby&#x27;s graphical style, combined with its stealth gameplay, has drawn comparisons to 1990&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza Bros&quot;. In turn, &quot;Trilby&quot; likely influenced later indie stealth games such as 2013&#x27;s &quot;Gunpoint&quot; and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Master Spy.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; (PlayStation 3) introduced a battlezone element, where the stealth gameplay is incorporated into a battlefield fought between two armies, both of which can be infiltrated by Solid Snake.

In 2009, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; broadened its predecessor&#x27;s elements of stealth by allowing the player to blend among any group of civilians, rather than specific ones. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; also allowed the player to distract guards by tossing coins or by hiring thieves and courtesans, and also featured a notoriety level, which made the player more recognizable until they paid off officials or tore down wanted posters. The same year, &quot;Uncharted 2: Among Thieves&quot; and &quot;&quot; incorporated stealth elements in different segments of the games. The multiplayer modes of &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Killzone 3&quot; in 2011 also incorporated stealth elements.

In 2009, independent developers began to work on a recreation of &quot;Thief&quot; called &quot;The Dark Mod&quot;. The project began as a mod of &quot;Doom 3&quot; but became a standalone project as of 2013. It features approximately 150 community-built missions and is one of the only open-source stealth games in development.

2010 saw the release of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;, which is notable for continuing to evolve the series&#x27; social stealth elements by introducing a multiplayer component where players must hide in crowds from other rival assassins.

=== Recent developments: 2012–present ===

The 2012 game &quot;Dishonored&quot; tried to incorporate stealth elements that were influenced by &quot;&quot;, such as the importance of lighting and shadows. The developers later abandoned that system citing realism as a factor. The game instead relies on a system of &quot;occlusion-based&quot; stealth, using the vision cones of the enemies, obstacles, and special abilities which determines whether or not the character is visible. Additionally, while other games had implemented such systems, &quot;Dishonored&quot; was recognized for having a forgiving stealth system compared with &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, in that if detected, the player had several options available to either attack those enemies that detected them, distract them, or flee and outrun them by using parkour, rather than immediately reaching a &quot;game over&quot;. Forbes called &quot;Dishonored&quot; one of the best stealth games of 2012, along with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mark of the Ninja&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Dishonored 2&quot;, released in 2016 and was praised for improving upon the stealth elements of its predecessor.

&quot;Mark of the Ninja&quot; put a twist on the stealth genre in that it is a 2D side-scroller. This posed some unique factors, such as the lack of corners for the character to hide behind, and the visibility presented in a side-scroller; the developers overcame this by adding &#x27;fog&#x27; that prevents the player from seeing things that the character can not see, visually representing enemy line-of-sight and even visualizing the noise made by the character, including how far that noise travels. After the completion of the game, the player has access to a harder difficulty called &quot;New Game Plus&quot;, which further decreases visibility by adding fog behind the player and removes noise visualizations and enemy line of sight indicators.

Throughout the 2010s, stronger technology allowed for larger environments and spurred the development of next-gen entries in existing stealth franchises. 2015&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; concluded the main &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, introducing an open-world for the first time in the franchise. In 2016, &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot; took a similar approach with a semi-open world designed around city hubs. 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot; reboot also drastically increased the size of its game maps.

2013&#x27;s &quot;Splinter Cell: Blacklist&quot; was considered a return to form after 2010&#x27;s controversial entry, &quot;Splinter Cell: Conviction,&quot; which departed from the series formula by forcing combat. &quot;Blacklist&quot; retained some of the modern conventions of the previous entry, most notably context actions, and was recognized for balancing action gameplay with pure stealth options. 2013 also saw the release of &quot;Payday 2&quot; and the top-down &quot;&quot;, both of which are cooperative stealth games focused around heists.

Between 2013 and 2016, &quot;République&quot; reunited some of the developers and cast of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series in an episodic point-and-click stealth game. The game&#x27;s unique play style required users to hack doors and surveillance systems from a bird&#x27;s eye view in order to navigate their character through the environment.

In 2014, Creative Assembly released &quot;&quot;, a stealth game which emphasized survival-horror. In this game, the protagonist is trapped on a space station with an alien xenomorph which they must avoid for the majority of the game, being unable to kill it. The game also uses feedback from the player&#x27;s microphone to enhance gameplay as the alien is able to hear noises made by the player and can use them to detect their location.

2014&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was recognized by many reviewers as a &quot;pure stealth&quot; game that discouraged combat. It also provided a distinctive scouting game mechanic through the use of clones.

2016 saw a comeback of &quot;Commandos&quot;-like stealth games with the release of &quot;Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,&quot; published nine years after the previous Commandos-style game &quot;Helldorado&quot;. In 2020 &quot;Shadow Tactics&quot; developer Mimimi produced a new entry in the Desperados series, titled &quot;Desperados III.&quot; In 2021 the developer announced a standalone expansion to &quot;Shadow Tactics&quot; called &quot;Aiko&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Recent years have also seen procedurally generated and randomized stealth games including 2015&#x27;s turn-based &quot;Invisible Inc,&quot; and 2017&#x27;s top-down action stealth game &quot;Heat Signature.&quot;

In 2019, Asobo Studio&#x27;s &quot;A Plague Tale: Innocence&quot; and FromSoftware&#x27;s &quot;&quot; were recognized for their stealth elements. 2019 also saw &quot;Untitled Goose Game&quot; by Australian developer House House utilize stealth as a major mechanic alongside the otherwise comedic tone of the game, leading to comparisons to &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Hitman.&quot;

In 2020, &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; released which has been praised for how its level design encourages sneaking around enemies using stealth during combat encounters. It was also praised for its AI, enemies will search for the player using tracking dogs and change their search patterns upon finding dead bodies.

2021&#x27;s &quot;Hitman 3&quot; concluded the &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy and was highly praised for its sandbox and social stealth elements, with &quot;PC Gamer&quot; calling it the best stealth game of the year.

A recent development in the stealth genre has been the rise of multiplayer stealth games using elements from social deduction games like Werewolf or Mafia. Games like &quot;Among Us&quot; and &quot;SpyParty&quot; are all about &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot; and blending in to avoid detection from other players. This has the benefit of providing a &quot;real&quot; stealth experience compared to a singleplayer game and acts as a continuation of the trend pioneered by the multiplayer portion of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;.

<text>Franz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens (6 June 1809, Helmstedt – 25 September 1881, Hanover) was a German philologist.

He was born in Helmstedt. After studying at the University of Göttingen (1826-1829) under Karl Otfried Müller and Georg Ludolf Dissen, he worked as schoolteacher at the Pädagogium in Ilfeld (from 1831). In 1845 he was appointed director of the gymnasium in Lingen, and in 1849 succeeded GF Grotefend as director of the Lyceum at Hanover, a post which he filled with great success for thirty years.

His most important work was &quot;&quot;De Graecae Linguae Dialectis&quot; (1839-1843), a study of Aeolic and Doric dialects that became a standard treatise on the subject. He also published &quot;Bucolicorum Graecorum Reliquiae&quot; (1855-1859); studies on the dialects of Homer and the Greek lyrists; on Aeschylus (&quot;De causis quibusdam Aeschyli Nondum satis emendati&quot;&quot;); and some excellent school textbooks. A volume of his minor works (edited by Carl Ernst Christian Häberlin) was published in 1891, which also contains a complete list of his writings.

<text>The jellynose fishes or tadpole fishes are the small order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned fish is monotypic, containing a single family Ateleopodidae. It has about a dozen species in four genera, but these enigmatic fishes are in need of taxonomic revision. 

The scientific name means &quot;&quot;Ateleopus&quot;-shaped&quot;, from &quot;Ateleopus&quot; (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix &quot;-formes&quot;. It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek &quot;atelēs&quot; (ἀτελής, &quot;imperfect&quot;) + &quot;pous&quot; (πούς, &quot;foot&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the Greek part in reference to the reduced pectoral and ventral fins of the jellynoses.

==Description and ecology==
Jellynoses are deep-water, bottom-dwelling, marine fishes. They are known from the Caribbean Sea, eastern Atlantic, the western and central Indopacific, and the Pacific coast of Central America. Primarily known from mesopelagic waters, an unidentified species of &quot;Ateleopus&quot; was observed in the Java and Mariana Trenches in the southwest Pacific at hadal depths up to , extending the depth range of the family by 

Jellynose skeletons are largely cartilage (hence &#x27;jellynose&#x27;), although they are true teleosts and not closely related to Chondrichthyes. The heads are large, with a bulbous nose, and the (usually) elongated body tapers towards the tail. Their caudal fins are very small, and except for &quot;Guentherus&quot;, it is merged with the long anal fin (which has 70 fin rays or more). The pelvic fins of juveniles have up to 10 rays, but in adults this is reduced to a single elongated ray at the throat. Again, &quot;Guentherus&quot; is an exception, retaining several fins as adults and having ventral fins that are located behind (not below) the pectoral fins. dorsal fins tend to be high, with a rather short base (9–13 rays, but in some as few as three); they are placed just behind the head. They have seven branchiostegal rays. The species have a range of sizes, the longest reaching . A swim bladder is absent, and some species also lack scales.

Most of the species are poorly known, but the highfin tadpole fish (&quot;Guentherus altivelis&quot;) is of potential interest for commercial fishing.

== Systematics ==
Together with their relatives, the Stomiiformes, the jellynoses are often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii. Whether it is indeed justified to accept such a small group is doubtful; it may well be that the closest living relatives of the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and is probably not ideal due to the profusion of very small taxa it would create. In fact, in some treatments, the jellynose fishes are even placed in yet another monotypic superorder, the Ateleopodomorpha.

The Ateleopodidae have also been placed in the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which otherwise constitute additional superorders. The relationships of these to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii &quot;sensu lato&quot; or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately advanced Teleostei is in need of further study.

<text>The CDTV (from Commodore Dynamic Total Vision, later treated as a backronym for Compact Disc Television) is a home multimedia entertainment and video game console – convertible into a full-fledged personal computer by the addition of optional peripherals – developed by Commodore International and launched in April 1991.

==Description and critical response==
The CDTV is essentially a Commodore Amiga 500 home computer with a CD-ROM drive and remote control. With the optional keyboard, mouse, and floppy disk drive, it gained the functionality of the regular Amiga. Commodore marketed the machine as an all-in-one multimedia appliance. As such, it targeted the same market as the Philips CD-i. The expected market for multimedia appliances did not materialize, and neither machine met with any real commercial success. Though the CDTV was based entirely on Amiga hardware, it was marketed strictly as a CDTV, with the Amiga name omitted from product branding.

Commodore announced the CDTV at the summer 1990 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, promising to release it before the end of the year with 100 software titles. The product debuted in North America in March 1991 (CES Las Vegas) and in the UK (World of Commodore 1991 at Earls Court, London). It was advertised at £499 for the CDTV unit, remote control and two software titles. The device was released in the United States for $999.

In 1990 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that Commodore had a poor reputation among consumers and developers, citing &quot;abysmal record of customer and technical support in the past&quot;. The company chose Amiga-enthusiast magazines as its chief advertising channel, but the Amiga community on the whole avoided the CDTV in the expectation of an add-on CD-ROM drive for the Amiga, which eventually came in the form of the A570. This further hurt sales of the CDTV, as an A570-equipped A500 was electronically the same as a CDTV and, consequently, could run CDTV software, so there was very little motivation for an Amiga owner to buy a CDTV. However, Nolan Bushnell, one of the chief endorsers of the CDTV, argued the system&#x27;s high price alone was enough to explain its market failure: &quot;... it&#x27;s very difficult to sell significant numbers of anything at more than . ... I felt that I could sell a hundred thousand of something that costs standing on my head. I thought that it would be a no-brainer. And I can tell you that the number of units that we sold in the U.S. at you could put in your eye and not draw tears.&quot;

The CDTV was supplied with AmigaOS 1.3, rather than the more advanced and user-friendly 2.0 release that was launched at around the same time. Notably, the CDXL motion video format was primarily developed for the CDTV, making it one of the earliest consumer systems to allow video playback directly from CD-ROM.

By 1994 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the CDTV as a &quot;&quot; for Commodore. Though the company later developed an improved and cost-reduced CDTV-II, it was never released. Commodore discontinued the CDTV in 1993 with the launch of the Amiga CD32, which again was substantially based on Amiga hardware (in this case the newer Amiga 1200) but explicitly targeted the games market.

In December 2021 an unofficial free ROM update was released for CDTV (2.35), which brings compatibility with 68030 accelerator boards and 32-bit Fast RAM, allows non-CDTV titles to boot, fixes bugs and restores several features that were lost in the 2.7 and 2.30 ROMs. Because of copyright reasons the custom ROM is distributed in patch form.

The Commodore CDTV is reported to have sold 25,800 units in Germany, and around 29,000 units in the UK.

== Design ==

The CDTV was intended as a media appliance rather than a mainstream personal computer. As such, it came with an infrared remote control, and its housing had dimensions and styling that was comparable to most household stereo system components of the period. For the same reason, it was initially sold without a keyboard or a mouse (which could be added separately, and were later bundled with the machine). The CDTV was based on the same technology as earlier Amiga systems, but featured a single-speed CD-ROM drive and no floppy disk drive as standard.

==Technical specifications==

; Notes
==Official upgrades==
The CDTV is compatible with many Amiga peripherals from the same period. In addition, official CDTV peripherals and upgrades included:
*Wireless infrared mouse (CD1252)
*Wireless trackball
*Black styled keyboard
*SCSI controller providing both an internal and external SCSI connector for hard disk drives and other SCSI devices
*External black styled hard disk drive
*External black styled floppy disk drive (CD1411, an FB-354C)
*Proprietary memory cards with a capacity of 64 or 256 KB (CD1401/CD1405) allowing storage of game scores and progress
*Genlocks for NTSC or PAL (CD1300/CD1301) to overlay video signal with a secondary video source

==Versions==
*CDTV: CDTV unit and remote control/gamepad
*Pro pack: CDTV unit, remote control/gamepad, keyboard, mouse and floppy disk drive, along with Almathera CDPD Public domain software compilation on CD-ROM

<doc id="245395" wikidata="Q2249650" url="?curid=245395" title="Underworld (novel)">
<text>Underworld is a 1997 novel by American writer Don DeLillo. The novel is centered on the efforts of Nick Shay, a waste management executive who grew up in the Bronx, to trace the history of the baseball that won the New York Giants the pennant in 1951, and encompasses numerous subplots drawn from American history in the second half of the twentieth century. Described as both postmodernist and a reaction to postmodernism, it examines themes of nuclear proliferation, waste, and the contribution of individual lives to the course of history.

A best-seller that was nominated for the National Book Award and shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, &quot;Underworld&quot; is often regarded as DeLillo&#x27;s supreme achievement. In 2006, a survey of eminent authors and critics conducted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; named &quot;Underworld &quot; as the runner-up for the best work of American fiction of the past 25 years, behind only Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot;.

==Background==
Following the publication of the well-regarded novels &quot;White Noise&quot; (1985), &quot;Libra&quot; (1988), and &quot;Mao II&quot; (1991), DeLillo made few public appearances and published little for several years while writing &quot;Underworld&quot;, besides the folio short story &quot;Pafko at the Wall&quot; which was incorporated into the prologue of &quot;Underworld&quot; with minor changes.

According to DeLillo, the novel&#x27;s title came to him as he thought about radioactive waste buried deep underground and about Pluto, the god of death. DeLillo has said that the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on October 4, 1951, inspired &quot;Underworld&quot;. That page has headlines about both the baseball game and the Soviet nuclear test that figure in the plot. 

The cover design for the American edition features a photograph the World Trade Center towers taken by André Kertész.

==Plot summary==
The prologue is a fictionalized account of The Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World, a home run by Bobby Thomson on October 3, 1951, that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants against their cross-town rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers. In DeLillo&#x27;s account, the game-winning ball is caught by a young black fan named Cotter Martin, while J. Edgar Hoover, watching in the stands, is informed in the middle of the game of the first Soviet test of the hydrogen bomb.

The remainder of the novel, comprising six parts and an epilogue, is a reverse chronological account of the life of Nick Shay, the man who ultimately ends up with the baseball, from his undirected existence as an executive of a waste management company in Arizona in the 1990s back to his childhood in the Bronx in the 1950s, though the non-linear narrative includes a large number of digressions and ancillary subplots.

Part 1 takes place in 1992. Nick Shay lives in Arizona with his wife, Marian, who is having an affair with his colleague, Brian Glassic. Nick visits an art installation of painted B-52 aircraft in the desert by Klara Sax, with whom Nick is later revealed to have had an affair forty years earlier. It is revealed that Nick killed a man when he was a teenager, and that Nick&#x27;s father disappeared when Nick was a child after going out to get a pack of Lucky Strikes. Nick prefers to imagine that he was killed by the Mafia. In a flashback to 1951, Cotter Martin&#x27;s father takes the baseball from his son with the intention of selling it.

In Part 2, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marian begins her affair with Brian, while Nick acquires the baseball from an avid baseball memorabilia collector named Marvin Lundy after Brian meets Lundy on a trip to New York City to see the Fresh Kills Landfill. Elsewhere, in the Bronx, a pessimistic, germophobic nun named Sister Edgar, who was Nick Shay&#x27;s Catholic school teacher in the 1950s, works among the unbelieving poor and sick. A videotape of a serial killer nicknamed the Texas Highway Killer is described.

In Part 3, in the spring of 1978, Nick attends a waste management conference in the Mojave Desert and meets a swinger named Donna, while Marvin Lundy traces the baseball to San Francisco.

Part 4, in the summer of 1974, mainly concerns Klara Sax, who is working as an artist in New York City, and Matt Shay, Nick&#x27;s brother, a former chess prodigy, who is a scientist in the nuclear weapons program in New Mexico.

Part 5 encompasses the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with Nick Shay in juvenile detention, following Nick&#x27;s relationship with a woman named Amy and later with his future wife Marian, and Matt&#x27;s courtship of his wife Janet. Lenny Bruce&#x27;s comedy routines on the Cuban Missile Crisis are mentioned several times. In another flashback, Cotter Martin&#x27;s father sells his baseball to Charles Wainright, a white fan standing in line with his son outside of Yankee Stadium.

Part 6, from the fall of 1951 to the summer of 1952, relates how Nick Shay, running loose after his father left his family, accidentally kills his friend George Manza.

In the epilogue, Nick and Brian travel to Kazakhstan to watch a demo of a new waste disposal system that incinerates the waste with a nuclear explosion. Nick confronts Brian about his affair with Marian, but decides to stay with Marian. Esmeralda, a feral girl in the Bronx whom the Catholic nuns were trying to save, is raped and murdered. Her image then miraculously appears on a billboard. Sister Edgar dies shortly after witnessing the miracle.

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;Underworld&quot; received high acclaim from literary critics, particularly for DeLillo&#x27;s prose and ambition. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;,
&quot;Times&quot;, and &quot;Mail On Sunday&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;.

David Wiegand of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declaring it DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;best novel and perhaps that most elusive of creatures, a Great American Novel.&quot; Many have described the book as emotionally powerful. David Foster Wallace wrote DeLillo a letter in 1997, praising the novel and DeLillo&#x27;s talent. He described &quot;the book as an organic thing&quot; and stated that This novel is (1) a great and significant piece of art fiction; (1a) not like any novel I&#x27;ve read; (2) your best work ever, so far; (3) a huge reward for someone who&#x27;s read all your previous stuff because it seems to be at once a synthesis and a transfiguration – a transcendence – of your previous stuff; (4) a book in which nothing is skimped or shirked or tossed off or played for the easy laugh, and where (it seems to me) you&#x27;ve taken some truly ballsy personal risks and exposed parts of yourself and hit a level of emotion you&#x27;ve never even tried for elsewhere (at least as I&#x27;ve read your work).He also remarked on the phonetics of the novel, telling Delillo &quot;you use these Saxonic devices heavily and over and over and yet the prose never seems heavy or straining; in fact just the opposite: it always seems exquisitely controlled, sober, poised rather than lunging.&quot;

Other critics, however, praised DeLillo&#x27;s prose but found the novel overlong and argued it could have benefited from more editing. On Salon.com, Laura Miller wrote that &quot;Nick&#x27;s secret, the one that supposedly provides the book&#x27;s suspense, proves anticlimactic.&quot;

In May 2006, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; named &quot;Underworld&quot; as a runner-up for the best work of American fiction of the previous 25 years. It garnered 11 of 125 votes, losing to Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; by four votes.

The literary critic Harold Bloom, although also expressing reservations about the book&#x27;s length, said &quot;Underworld&quot; was &quot;the culmination of what [DeLillo] can do&quot; and one of the few contemporary American works of fiction that &quot;touched what I would call the sublime,&quot; along with works by Cormac McCarthy (&quot;Blood Meridian&quot;), Philip Roth (&quot;American Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;), and Thomas Pynchon (&quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;).

&quot;Underworld&quot; was a finalist for the 1997 National Book Award, as well as for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize. The novel won the 2000 William Dean Howells Medal.

==Allusions and references==
The novel has J. Edgar Hoover utterly intrigued by &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot;, a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Hoover first sees the painting while at the baseball game; the painting was reproduced in &quot;Life&quot; and pieces of it fall on him when someone in the stands above tears up the magazine and tosses the pieces. Later in the book he obtains a print of the painting.

Several segments of the novel are named in homage to other works. &quot;Das Kapital&quot; is Karl Marx&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; is a song by Little Richard also famous as a cover by The Beatles, and &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; is an infamous unreleased Rolling Stones song and film. &quot;Better Things for Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; was an advertising slogan for DuPont, while &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; is an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century. The section titled &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black&quot; refers to a James McNeill Whistler painting better known as Whistler&#x27;s Mother.

The novel incorporates a number of historical events. The prologue is about &quot;The Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; and the whereabouts of the ball hit by Thomson are a recurrent element of the book. The book also employs Lenny Bruce’s reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis and Soviet Union&#x27;s atomic weapons program (including their testing grounds in Kazakhstan). Additionally described are screenings of the Zapruder film and a fictional, rediscovered Sergei Eisenstein film. Numerous characters attend Truman Capote&#x27;s famous Black and White Ball. The main character also finds himself walking through New York during a power outage amid the Northeast blackout of 1965.

Other references include a historical and biographical account of the building of the Watts Towers. There are also frequent references to &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

==Adaptation==
The novel was at one point optioned by producer Scott Rudin for a film adaptation before it lapsed. In 2002, Robert Greenwald held the rights and was in discussions for turning it into a television miniseries.

In 2020, Uri Singer acquired the rights to the novel. In September 2021, it was announced that Netflix will be adapting the novel into a feature film with Theodore Melfi as writer and director and Singer as producer.

<text>Ponce Denis Écouchard Lebrun (11 August 1729 – 31 August 1807) was a French lyric poet.

==Biography==
Lebrun was born in Paris at the house of the prince de Conti, to whom his father was valet. Among Lebrun&#x27;s school friends was a son of Louis Racine, whose disciple he became. In 1755 he published an &quot;Ode sur les désastres de Lisbonne&quot;. In 1759 he married Marie Anne de Surcourt, addressed in his &quot;Élégies&quot; as Fanny. In the early years of his marriage he produced his poem, &quot;Nature&quot;. His wife suffered much from his violent temper, and when in 1774 she brought an action against him to obtain a separation, she was supported by Lebrun&#x27;s own mother and sister.

Lebrun had been &quot;secrétaire des commandements&quot; to the prince de Conti, and on his patron&#x27;s death he lost this position. He also lost financially as a result of the bankruptcy of the prince de Guemene. To this period belongs a long poem, the &quot;Veillées des Muses&quot;, which remained unfinished, and his ode to Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, which ranks among his best works.

Dependent on government pensions he changed his politics with the times. He praised Calonne, comparing him with the great Sully, and likened Louis XVI to Henry IV of France, but he ended up as the Reign of Terror&#x27;s official poet. He occupied rooms in the Louvre, and fulfilled his obligations by shameless attacks on the king and queen. His excellent ode on the Vengeur and the &quot;Ode nationale contre l&#x27;Angleterre&quot; on the occasion of the projected invasion of Britain were written in honour of the power of Napoleon.

This &quot;versatility&quot; damaged Lebrun&#x27;s reputation, making it difficult to appreciate his real merit. He had a genius for epigram, and the quatrains and dizains directed against his many enemies have a verve generally lacking in his odes. The one directed against La Harpe is called by Sainte-Beuve the &quot;queen of epigrams.&quot;

La Harpe has said that the poet, called by his friends, perhaps with a spice of irony, Lebrun-Pindare, had written many fine strophes but not one good ode. The critic exposed mercilessly the obscurities and unlucky images which occur even in the ode to Buffon, and advised the author to imitate the simplicity and energy that adorned Buffon&#x27;s prose. His works were published by his friend PL Ginguené in 1811. The best of them are included in Prosper Poitevin&#x27;s &quot;Petits poètes français,&quot; which forms part of the &quot;Panthéon littéraire&quot;.

==Etymology==
The city was originally named &quot;Hradec&quot;, which is a diminutive of &quot;hrad&quot; (i.e. &#x27;castle&#x27;). Later, when it was owned by Bohemian queens, the &quot;Králové&quot; attribute (genitive of &quot;&quot;, &#x27;queen&#x27; in Old Czech) was added. So the name literally means &quot;queen&#x27;s castle&quot;.

==Geography==

Hradec Králové is located about east of Prague and forms an agglomeration with the city of Pardubice, which is located about south of Hradec Králové. It lies in the East Elbe Table, in the eastern part of the Polabí lowlands. The highest point is the hill Slatina at above sea level. The city is situated at the confluence of the Elbe and the Orlice rivers. The municipal territory is rich in small fishponds.

The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 10 February 1956 to on 2 August 1934.
==History==
===11th–16th centuries===
The first written mention of a castle named Hradec is in &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; written in 1119–1125, when the record of the castle is associated with the year 1091. The document from 1073 that mentioned Hradec is a forgery from the 12th century. The first written mention of the settlement of Hradec is from 1225 and it was already referred to as a city. In 1306, Hradec became a dowry town ruled by Bohemian queens. It was the residence of Elizabeth Richeza of Poland in 1308–1318 or Elizabeth of Pomerania in 1378–1393. In the 14th century, thanks to the presence of the queens, the city became a military and political center of a region with a high level of education and culture.

Extensive fires in 1290, 1339 and 1407 accelerated the reconstruction of the city. In 1420, during the Hussite Wars, the city was conquered by the Hussites and became their military centre. In 1423, the Hussites completely destroyed the castle where the queens used to live. During the rule of King George of Poděbrady, the city experienced a new period of economic, political and cultural prosperity.

The development ended in 1547, when Hradec Králové joined the campaign against Emperor Ferdinand I, and as a result many of its properties were confiscated and its privileges were taken away. The city did not recover economically until the end of the 16th century. At this time, the houses were rebuilt in the Renaissance style.

===17th–18th centuries===

Hradec Králové was hit hard by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It was conquered by the Swedish army in 1639 and several more times in the following years. At the end of the war, the city was depopulated and almost destroyed. However, the city recovered and in the 17th and early 18th century acquired a Baroque character. During the War of the Austrian Succession, the city was again involved in the war due to its strategic location.

In 1766, Joseph II decided to build a large modern military fortress in the city. Its construction changed the character of the city and its surroundings, some suburbs were demolished and the inhabitants moved into newly established settlements. A nearby hill was dismantled to build the massive walls and the riverbed of both the Elbe and the Orlice were changed. A complete defense infrastructure was built inside the walls. The fortress was finished in 1789 and occupied , but during its existence, it was never used in the war.

===19th–20th centuries===

In the mid-19th century, the industrialisation began and several industrial enterprises were founded inside the fortifications. The Battle of Königgrätz, the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War, took place on 3 July 1866 near Hradec Králové. This event is commemorated in the famous &quot;Königgrätzer Marsch&quot;. Moreover, the battle put an end to the age of fortifications. The fortress was formally abolished in 1884 and gradually demolished between 1893 and 1914. The last remnants were demolished between 1929 and 1930.

In 1884, a then-unique international competition for the city&#x27;s regulatory plan was announced. In the 1890s, several representative buildings (monastery, synagogue, high school, etc.) were built. Before the World War I, the harmonious development of the city and its high architectural level were influenced especially by the architect Jan Kotěra. In the 1920s, his pupil, another prominent Czech architect Josef Gočár, became the leading figure in the city&#x27;s development, and his regulatory plan created in 1926–1928 became the basis for the construction activity in the years to come. The urban development of Hradec Králové in the 1920s and 1930s was also appreciated abroad and the city was nicknamed the &quot;Salon of the Republic&quot;.

==Demographics==

<text>José-Maria de Heredia (22 November 1842 – 3 October 1905) was a Cuban-born French Parnassian poet. He was the fifteenth member elected for seat 4 of the Académie française in 1894.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Heredia was born at Fortuna Cafeyere, near Santiago de Cuba, to Domingo de Heredia Mieses Pimentel Guridi native of Santo Domingo and his second wife, French Louise Girard d&#x27;Houville. At the age of eight he went from the West Indies to France, returning from there to Havana at age seventeen, and finally making France his home not long afterwards. He received his classical education with the priests of Saint Vincent at Senlis, and after his visit to Havana he studied at the Ecole des Chartes at Paris. During the later 1860s, with François Edouard Joachim Coppée, René François Armand Sully-Prudhomme, Paul Verlaine and others less distinguished, he was one of the poets who associated with Charles Leconte de Lisle, and were given the name of &quot;Parnassiens&quot;.

===Career===
To this new school, form – the technical part of their art – was of supreme importance, and, as a reaction against the influence of Alfred de Musset, they repressed in their work the expression of personal feeling and emotion. &quot;True poetry,&quot; said M. de Heredia in his discourse on entering the academy, &quot;dwells in nature and in humanity, which are eternal, and not in the heart of the creature of a day, however great.&quot; De Heredia wrote very little, and published even less, but his sonnets were circulated in manuscript form, and gave him a reputation before they were published in 1893, together with a few longer poems, as a volume, with the title &quot;Les Trophées&quot;. In the original work, he called to his great friend, the artist Ernest Jean-Marie Millard de Bois Durand, to illustrate his book of original watercolors.

He was granted French nationality in 1893 and was subsequently elected to the Académie française on 22 February 1894, in the place of Charles de Mazade the publicist. Few purely literary men can have entered the academy with so few credentials. A small volume of verse; a translation, with introduction, of Diaz del Castillo&#x27;s &quot;History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot; (1878–1881); a translation of the life of the nun Alferez (1894), Thomas de Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Military Nun&quot;; one or two short pieces of occasional verse; and an introduction or so – this is but small literary output. But the sonnets are of their kind among the most skilled of modern literature. &quot;A Légende des siècles in sonnets&quot; M. François Coppée termed them. In 1901 de Heredia became librarian of the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal at Paris. He died at the Château de Bourdonné in Seine-et-Oise on 3 October 1905, having completed his critical edition of André Chénier&#x27;s works.

<text>The Marion Popcorn Festival is held every year in downtown Marion, Ohio, United States. The festival was established in 1981 and is held annually during the first weekend after Labor Day in September. Marion was once an epicenter of popcorn manufacturing, made by such companies as Wyandot Snacks and Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s (currently made by ConAgra). Wyandot Snacks was once the largest exporter of popcorn in the United States, and Cracker Jack was manufactured in Marion for almost a decade. In 1982, the second year of the festival, Wyandot Snacks presented a 40 foot long bag of popcorn, which they submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records for consideration as the largest bag of popcorn in the world.

Festival organizers schedule nationally known acts like Gloria Estefan, REO Speedwagon, Styx, Lorrie Morgan, The Neville Brothers, and native son Huey Lewis and the News to perform at the festival. It is said to be the biggest popcorn festival in the world, attracting crowds of over 250,000.

In 2004, the Travel Channel came to the festival and recorded parts of the festival as part of Taste of America with Mark DeCarlo.

In 2016 Kellie Pickler and Skid Row performed. In 2017 The Georgia Satellites and the Gin Blossoms performed.

In 2019 Frankie Ballard and Hinder performed.

The 2020 Festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="245407" wikidata="Q3281331" url="?curid=245407" title="List of feeding behaviours">
<text>Feeding is the process by which organisms, typically animals, obtain food. Terminology often uses either the suffixes -vore, -vory, or -vorous from Latin &quot;vorare&quot;, meaning &quot;to devour&quot;, or -phage, -phagy, or -phagous from Greek φαγεῖν (), meaning &quot;to eat&quot;.

==Evolutionary history==
The evolution of feeding is varied with some feeding strategies evolving several times in independent lineages. In terrestrial vertebrates, the earliest forms were large amphibious piscivores 400 million years ago. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types, other tetrapods (carnivory), and later, plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation (in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials).

==Evolutionary adaptations==

The specialization of organisms towards specific food sources is one of the major causes of evolution of form and function, such as:

* Mouth parts and teeth, such as in whales, vampire bats, leeches, mosquitos, predatory animals such as felines and fishes, etc.
* Distinct forms of beaks in birds, such as in hawks, woodpeckers, pelicans, hummingbirds, parrots, Kingfishers, etc.
* Specialized claws and other appendages, for apprehending or killing (including fingers in primates)
* Changes in body colour for facilitating camouflage, disguise, setting up traps for preys, etc.
* Changes in the digestive system, such as the system of stomachs of herbivores, commensalism and symbiosis

==Classification==

===By mode of ingestion===
There are many modes of feeding that animals exhibit, including:

*Filter feeding: A form of food procurement in which food particles or small organisms are randomly strained from water.

*Deposit feeding: obtaining nutrients from particles suspended in soil

*Fluid feeding: obtaining nutrients by consuming other organisms&#x27; fluids
*Bulk feeding: obtaining nutrients by eating all of an organism.

*Ram feeding and suction feeding: ingesting prey via the fluids around it.

===By mode of digestion===
*Extra-cellular digestion: excreting digesting enzymes and then reabsorbing the products
*Myzocytosis: one cell pierces another using a feeding tube, and sucks out cytoplasm
*Phagocytosis: engulfing food matter into living cells, where it is digested

===By food type===
 is the habit in an animal species, of eating and tolerating a relatively wide variety of foods, whereas monophagy is the intolerance of every food except for one specific type (see generalist and specialist species). is a term for intermediate degrees of selectivity, referring to animals that eat a relatively small range of foods, either because of preference or necessity. 

Another classification refers to the specific food animals specialize in eating, such as:
* Carnivore: the eating of animals
** Araneophagy: eating spiders
** Avivore: eating birds
** Corallivore: eating coral
** Durophagy: eating hard-shelled or exoskeleton bearing organisms
** Egg predator: eating eggs (but also see &quot;Intrauterine cannibalism&quot; below), also Ovivore
** Haematophage/Sanguivore: eating blood
** Insectivore: eating insects
*** Myrmecophage: eating ants and/or termites
** Invertivore: eating invertebrates
** Keratophagy or Ceratophagy: eating keratin-based material, such as wool by cloths moths, or snakes eating their own skin after ecdysis.
** Lepidophagy: eating fish scales

The eating of non-living or decaying matter:

* Coprophage: eating faeces
* Detritivore: eating decomposing material
* Geophagia: eating inorganic earth
* Osteophage: eating bones
* Saprophage: eating decaying organic matter
* Scavenger: eating carrion

There are also several unusual feeding behaviours, either normal, opportunistic, or pathological, such as:
* Cannibalism: feeding on members of the same species
** Anthropophagy: the practice of eating human flesh
** Autocannibalism: feeding on parts of one&#x27;s own body (see also autophagy)
** Filial cannibalism
** Intrauterine cannibalism
*** Oophagy or ovophagy: the embryo/foetus eats sibling eggs
*** Embryophagy: the foetus eats sibling embryos
** Sexual cannibalism: cannibalism after mating
* Kleptoparasitism: stealing food from another animal
*Kleptopharmacophagy: act of stealing chemical compounds for consumption
* Lignophagia: eating wood, typically a pathological condition in some domestic animals
* Paedophagy: eating young animals
* Pica: appetite for largely non-nutritive substances, e.g. clay or hair, sometimes in pregnancy or in pathological states, typically a medical or veterinary concern.
* Placentophagy: eating placenta
* Trophallaxis: eating food regurgitated by another animal
* Zoopharmacognosy: self-medication by eating plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease.
An opportunistic feeder sustains itself from a number of different food sources, because the species is behaviourally sufficiently flexible.

==Storage behaviours==
Some animals exhibit hoarding and caching behaviours in which they store or hide food for later use.

<text>CD32 (cluster of differentiation 32), also known as FcγRII or FCGR2, is a surface receptor glycoprotein belonging to the Ig gene superfamily. CD32 can be found on the surface of a variety of immune cells. CD32 has a low-affinity for the Fc region of IgG antibodies in monomeric form, but high affinity for IgG immune complexes. CD32 has two major functions: cellular response regulation, and the uptake of immune complexes. Cellular responses regulated by CD32 include phagocytosis, cytokine stimulation, and endocytic transport. Dysregulated CD32 is associated with different forms of autoimmunity, including systemic lupus erythematosus. In humans, there are three major CD32 subtypes: CD32A, CD32B, and CD32C. While CD32A and CD32C are involved in activating cellular responses, CD32B is inhibitory.

== Structure and signaling ==
CD32 is a type I transmembrane protein with a helical transmembrane region. Whereas the extracellular region consists of three immunoglobulin domains (roughly 100 a.a. in length), the cytosolic region varies by subtype. CD32A and CD32C possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), while CD32B has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Both motif types rely upon interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins to transduce signals upon binding to an IgG immune complex. When an ITIM is phosphorylated, it activates effector proteins that dephosphorylate the downstream targets of the ITAM signal cascade, such as MAP kinases.

CD32 receptors bind to the lower hinge region of IgG via an extracellular domain. Additionally, all CD32 subtypes readily bind IgG1 and IgG3 immune complexes, but differ in their binding affinities for IgG2 and IgG4. CD32A binds IgG2 immune complexes, but not IgG4. CD32B and CD32C bind IgG4 immune complexes, but not IgG2. The usage of monoclonal antibodies can distinguish between CD32A and CD32B; however, the high degree of homology between the extracellular domains of CD32A and CD32C make differentiation difficult.

== Functions and locations ==

=== &quot;CD32A&quot; ===
CD32A is an activating subtype of CD32 that can be found on a variety of immune cells - notably, CD32A is found on platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). On platelets, it is known to aid in the internalization of IgG-opsonized &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and it is more generally implicated in mediating bacterial-activated platelet responses. CD32A also plays an important role in platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation in response to injured blood vessels. When bound to an IgG immune complex, the cytosolic ITAM can promote phagocytic activity and cytokine secretion in neutrophils and macrophages. CD32A is known to aid in the activation of clathrin coat-mediated endocytosis on various cell types. On DCs, CD32A plays an important role in maturation and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on the cell surface, strengthening the DC&#x27;s ability to present antigen to T cells. CD32A activation is necessary and sufficient to produce T cell anti-tumor cellular immunity. CD32A is also linked to autoimmunity; for example, the production of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to CD32A is linked to the development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

CD32A is also found on Langerhans cells, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, megakaryocytes, and a subpopulation of activated CD4+ T cells. CD32A is unique to primates.

=== &quot;CD32B&quot; ===
CD32B is an inhibitory surface receptor that is part of a large population of B cell co-receptors, which act to modulate signaling. Activated CD32B has the ability to cross-link with B cell receptors (BCRs), which increases the threshold for B cell activation and downregulates antibody production in the presence of IgG. This feedback loop lowers the production of IgG by B cells when there is a surplus of IgG in the body. CD32B is also found on the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which utilize CD32B for the retention and recycling of immune complexes that they later present to B cells. Thus, CD32B plays an important role in both antibody and memory immune responses.

The balance between CD32B and its activating counterparts is crucial to appropriate cell function. Having too little CD32B has been associated with dysregulated antibody function, as well as increased antibody-dependent inflammatory cell responses. Some individuals inheriting mutated, inactivate CD32B genes have a reduced risk of contracting malaria; this is attributed to an enhancement of FcR-dependent phagocytic functions. CD32B imbalance is also associated with autoimmunity. CD32B-deficient mice have been found to be more susceptible to immune-complex-mediated autoimmunity. Likewise, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans is associated with a decrease in CD32B on the surface of memory B cells. A decrease on dendritic cells is often found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The therapeutic usage of monoclonal antibodies against CD32B can be effective for inducing cytotoxicity against B cell lymphoma cells.

CD32B is also found on basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.

==== Non-immune system locations ====
CD32B can be found on airway smooth muscle cells, as well as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and salivary gland epithelial cells.

=== &quot;CD32C&quot; ===
CD32C is expressed in ~20% of the human population, and is not well-understood. It can be found on B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. When expressed, CD32C plays an important role in the activation of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Animal studies have linked CD32C to augmentation of pathological inflammatory responses.

<text>The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (, abbr. UNITA) is the second-largest political party in Angola. Founded in 1966, UNITA fought alongside the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in the Angolan War for Independence (1961–1975) and then against the MPLA in the ensuing civil war (1975–2002). The war was one of the most prominent Cold War proxy wars, with UNITA receiving military aid initially from the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1966 until October 1975 and later from the United States and apartheid South Africa while the MPLA received material and technical support from the Soviet Union and its allies, especially Cuba.

Until 1996, UNITA was funded through Angolan diamond mines in both Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul along the Cuango River valley, especially the Catoca mine, which was Angola&#x27;s only Kimberlite mine at that time. Valdemar Chindondo served as chief of staff in the government of UNITA, pro-Western rebels, during the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002). Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, allegedly ordered Chindondo&#x27;s assassination.

Savimbi&#x27;s successor as president of UNITA was Isaías Samakuva. Following Savimbi&#x27;s death, UNITA abandoned armed struggle and participated in electoral politics. The party won 51 out of 220 seats in the 2017 parliamentary election. Samakuva resigned as party leader in November 2019, being replaced by Adalberto Costa Júnior.

==Founding==
Jonas Savimbi and Antonio da Costa Fernandes founded UNITA on 13 March 1966 in Muangai in Moxico province in Portuguese Angola (during the Estado Novo regime). 200 other delegates were present in the event. UNITA launched its first attack on Portuguese colonial authorities on 25 December 1966.

Savimbi was originally affiliated with Holden Roberto&#x27;s National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). UNITA later moved to Jamba in Angola&#x27;s southeastern province of Cuando Cubango. UNITA&#x27;s leadership was drawn heavily from Angola&#x27;s majority Ovimbundu ethnic group and its policies were originally Maoist, they quickly abandoned the Maoist struggle, when they started collaborating with Portuguese Officials against the MPLA. They then aimed for rural rights and recognized ethnic divisions. During the 1980s, however, UNITA was aligned with the United States and apartheid South Africa. After the 1992 Angolan general election, UNITA lost its support from the United States and was only supported by apartheid South Africa.

==Independence and civil war==

After the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola in 1974–75 and the end of their colonial rule, the MPLA and UNITA splintered, and civil war began as the movements clashed militarily and ideologically. MPLA leader Agostinho Neto became the first president of post-colonial Angola. Backed by Soviet and Cuban money, weapons and troops, the MPLA defeated the FNLA militarily and forced them largely into exile. UNITA also was nearly destroyed in November 1975, but it managed to survive and set up a second government, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Angola, in the provincial capital of Huambo. UNITA was hard-pressed but recovered with South African aid and then was strengthened considerably by U.S. support during the 1980s. The MPLA&#x27;s military presence was strongest in Angolan cities, the coastal region and the strategic oil fields. But UNITA controlled much of the highland&#x27;s interior, notably the Bié Plateau, and other strategic regions of the country. Up to 300,000 Angolans died in the civil war.

===Guerrilla movement===

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Savimbi sought out vastly expanded relations with the U.S. He received considerable guidance from The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative research institute in Washington, D.C. that maintained strong relations with both the Reagan administration and the U.S. Congress. Michael Johns, the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s leading expert on Africa and Third World Affairs issues, visited Savimbi in his clandestine southern Angolan base camps, offering the UNITA leader both tactical military and political advice. Through the lobbying efforts of Paul Manafort and his firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly which was paid $600,000 each year from Savimbi beginning in 1985, UNITA gained strong backing from the Reagan administration.

In 1986, U.S. conservatives convinced President Ronald Reagan to meet with Savimbi at the White House. While the meeting itself was confidential, Reagan emerged from it with support and enthusiasm for Savimbi&#x27;s efforts, stating that he could envision a UNITA &quot;victory that electrifies the world,&quot; suggesting that Reagan saw the outcome of the Angolan conflict as critical to his entire Reagan Doctrine foreign policy, consisting of support for anti-communist resistance movements in Central America, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.

Under Savimbi&#x27;s leadership, UNITA proved especially effective militarily before and after independence, becoming one of the world&#x27;s most effective armed resistance movements of the late 20th century. According to the U.S. State Department, UNITA came to control &quot;vast swaths of the interior (of Angola)&quot;. Savimbi&#x27;s very survival in Angola in and of itself was viewed as an incredible accomplishment, and he came to be known as &quot;Africa&#x27;s most enduring bush fighter&quot; given assassination attempts, aided by extensive Soviet, Cuban, and East German military troops, advisors and support, that he survived.

As Savimbi gained ground despite the forces aligned against him, American conservatives pointed to his success, and that of Afghan mujahideen and the Nicaraguan contras, all of which, with U.S. support, were successfully opposing Soviet-sponsored governments, as evidence that the U.S. was beginning to gain an upper hand in the Cold War conflict and that the Reagan Doctrine was working. Critics, on the other hand, responded that the support given to UNITA, the contras, and the Afghan mujahideen was inflaming regional conflicts at great expense to these nations. Furthermore, UNITA, like the Angolan government it fought, was criticized for human rights abuses.

===1980s===
UNITA gained some international notoriety in 1983 after abducting 66 Czechoslovak civilians and detaining a third of them for about 15 months. Belgium eventually negotiated the release of the civilians. Fighting in Angola continued until 1989, when, with UNITA advancing militarily, Cuba withdrew its support, removing several thousand troops that it had dispatched to Angola to fight Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA. With many commentators and foreign policy specialists seeing that the Cold War might be drawing to an end, Savimbi&#x27;s U.S. support, which had been strong, began to be questioned, with some in Congress urging the end of U.S. support for UNITA. Matters were further complicated by repeated reports that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had raised U.S. support for UNITA in several formal and informal summit meetings with President George H. W. Bush, placing further pressure on the U.S. to end its support for UNITA.

As the war began to include both military and diplomatic components, Johns and leading U.S. conservatives urged Savimbi to make a ceasefire contingent on the MPLA&#x27;s agreement to &quot;free and fair elections.&quot; When the UNITA demand was originally rebuffed by the MPLA, Savimbi vastly intensified his military pressure, while alleging that the MPLA was resisting free and fair elections because they feared a UNITA electoral victory. Meanwhile, an agreement was reached that provided for the removal of foreign troops from Angola in exchange for the independence of Namibia from South Africa. In Angola, however, Savimbi told Johns and conservative leader Howard Phillips that he had not felt adequately consulted on the negotiations or agreement and was in opposition to it. &quot;There are a lot of loopholes in that agreement. The agreement is not good at all,&quot; Johns reported Savimbi telling both of them during a March 1989 visit with Savimbi in Angola.&quot;

A ceasefire ultimately was negotiated and MPLA leader José Eduardo dos Santos and the MPLA&#x27;s Central Committee rejected its Marxist past and agreed to Savimbi&#x27;s demand for free and fair elections, though UNITA and its supporters viewed the promises skeptically, especially because the MPLA&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union remained strong.

===1990s===

Following the 1991 Bicesse Accords, signed in Lisbon, United Nations-brokered elections were held, with both Savimbi and dos Santos running for president in 1992. Failing to win an overall majority in the first round of balloting, and then questioning the election&#x27;s legitimacy, Savimbi and UNITA returned to armed conflict. Fighting resumed in October 1992 in Huambo, quickly spreading to Angola&#x27;s capital, Luanda. It was here that Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA&#x27;s long-time vice-president and other UNITA officials were killed while fleeing the city culminating in the Halloween Massacre. Following Chitunda&#x27;s death, UNITA defensively moved their base from Jamba to Huambo. Savimbi&#x27;s 1992 decision to return to combat ultimately proved a costly one, with many of Savimbi&#x27;s U.S. conservative allies urging Savimbi to contest dos Santos electorally in the run-off election. Savimbi&#x27;s decision to forego the run-off also greatly strained UNITA&#x27;s relations with U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

As Savimbi resumed fighting, the U.N. responded by implementing an embargo against UNITA through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173. The UN-commissioned Fowler Report detailed how UNITA continued to finance its war effort through the sales of diamonds (later to be known as blood diamonds) and resulted in further sanctions in the form of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295 and action to end to the trade in blood diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. In late 1992 following the general elections, the U.S. government, which had never recognized the legitimacy of the MPLA, finally recognized the Angolan government and stopped supporting UNITA, further alienating Savimbi. After failed talks in 1993 to end the conflict, another agreement, the Lusaka Protocol, was implemented in 1994 to form a government of national unity. In 1995, U.N. peacekeepers arrived. But UNITA broke away from the Lusaka agreement in 1998, citing violations of it by the MPLA. In late 1998, a militant group calling itself &quot;UNITA Renovada&quot; broke away from mainstream UNITA, when several UNITA commanders dissatisfied with the leadership of Jonas Savimbi ended their allegiance to his organization. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000.

In 1999, a MPLA military offensive known as Operation Restore damaged UNITA considerably, essentially destroying UNITA as a conventional military force and forcing UNITA to return to more traditional guerrilla tactics. In October 1999, UNITA alleged that the FAA Embraer EMB 312 Tucanos used during Operation Restore were crewed by Brazilian pilots on contract to the Angolan government. UNITA subsequently declared &quot;that anything within the Angolan national territory, identified as Brazil&#x27;s interest, is... considered a target and will not be spared&quot; from their attacks.

===2000s===
The Angolan civil war ended only after the death of Savimbi, who was killed in an ambush on 22 February 2002. His death was shocking to many Angolans, many of whom had grown up during the Angolan civil war and witnessed Savimbi&#x27;s ability to successfully evade efforts by Soviet, Cuban and Angolan troops to kill him.

Six weeks following Savimbi&#x27;s death, in April 2002, UNITA agreed to a ceasefire with the government. Under an amnesty agreement, UNITA soldiers and their families, comprising roughly 350,000 people, were gathered in 33 demobilisation camps under the &quot;Program For Social and Productive Reintegration of Demobilized and War Displaced People&quot;. In August 2002, UNITA officially gave up its armed wing, and UNITA placed all of its efforts on the development of its political party. Despite the ceasefire, deep political conflict between UNITA and the MPLA remains.

Savimbi was immediately succeeded by António Dembo, who died shortly after Savimbi. Following Dembo, in elections contested by General Paulo Lukamba Gato, Dinho Chingunji and Isaías Samakuva, Samakuva won the UNITA election and emerged as UNITA&#x27;s new president.

In November 2019, Isaias Samakuva resigned as president and was replaced by Adalberto Costa Júnior with Arlete Leona Chimbinda as the new vice-president.

==Foreign support==
UNITA received support from several governments in Africa and around the world, including the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, Egypt, France, Israel, Morocco, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Zaire, and Zambia.

===United States===

During the Reagan administration high ranking security officials met with UNITA leaders. Central Intelligence Agency Director William J. Casey, National Security Advisor Richard Allen, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig, on 6 March met with UNITA leaders in Washington, D.C. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Walker met with Savimbi in March in Rabat, Morocco. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, his assistant for International Security Matters Francis West, Deputy Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, Deputy Director of the CIA Bobby Inman, and Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency James Williams met with Savimbi between November 1981 and January 1982. Although the Clark Amendment forbid U.S. involvement in the civil war, Secretary Haig told Savimbi in December 1981 that the U.S. would continue to provide assistance to UNITA.

The U.S. government &quot;explicitly encouraged&quot; the governments of Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Zaire to aid UNITA. In 1983 the U.S. and South African governments agreed to ship weapons from the Honduras, Belgium and Switzerland to South Africa and then to UNITA in Angola. The U.S. also traded weapons with South Africa for intelligence on the civil war.

Savimbi benefited from the support of influential American conservatives, including The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Michael Johns and other U.S. conservative leaders, who helped elevate Savimbi&#x27;s stature in Washington and promoted the transfer of American weapons to his war.

Johns and other American conservatives met regularly with Savimbi in remote Jamba, culminating in the &quot;Democratic International&quot; in 1985. Savimbi later drew the praise of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who hailed him as a freedom fighter and spoke of Savimbi winning a victory that &quot;electrifies the world&quot; while others hinted at a much darker regime, dismissing Savimbi as a power-hungry propagandist.

After the 1992 Angolan general election, UNITA lost its support from the United States and was only supported by South Africa. Support ceased after the end of the &quot;apartheid&quot; in South Africa and the election of Nelson Mandela as President in 1994; Mandela and the African National Congress had given the MPLA military support through the ANC armed wing &quot;uMkhonto we Sizwe&quot;.

<text>Jane Barbe ( ; July 29, 1928 – July 18, 2003) was an American voice actress and singer. She was known as the &quot;Time Lady&quot; for the recordings she made for the Bell System and other phone companies. The ubiquity of her recordings eventually made her a pop culture figure, and her death drew national attention.

== Career ==
Barbe was born Millicent Jane Schneider in Winter Haven, Florida, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She studied drama at the University of Georgia.

After graduating, Barbe worked as a copywriter, though due to her poor spelling, she opted to read her first commercial out loud to her boss instead of submitting it in writing. He asked her to record the commercial herself. In 1963, she began recording messages for the Audichron Company, announcing time, temperature and weather, as well as recordings for early voicemail systems. In the 1970s and 1980s, she regularly recorded the intercept messages used when a number is disconnected or misdialed, and started sharing recording duties with AT&amp;T voice Pat Fleet in 1981, who eventually took over Barbe&#x27;s role.

Barbe was selected to be the first voice on the Octel Communications voicemail systems and retained that role for many years. Her voice was used on all the prompts (which numbered in the thousands). People often referred to the voice on Octel systems as &quot;Jane&quot;, and Barbe and her husband John were named honorary life employees of Octel in 1992. Over 150 million people used Octel systems prior to the company being acquired in 1997 by Lucent. By 2000, Barbe&#x27;s voice was heard by about 300 million people each week. Through the years, Barbe&#x27;s voice became well known through the phone companies&#x27; use of her recordings, as well as her messages recorded for customized greetings for various corporations who bought Octel voicemail systems. The time announcements she recorded for NBS (now NIST) are still used on radio station WWVH. Her voice was also heard on hotel wake-up calls and commercial elevator messages.

Recordings with her voice are also used in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Although her native dialect was Southern, she learned to adopt her trademark &quot;General American&quot; speech while studying drama. When asked to record 1,500 time and temperature messages for Telecom Australia, she perfected an Australian accent by listening to recordings of Australian speakers.

==Other work==
Barbe was also a former professional singer, meeting her husband while touring with the Buddy Morrow Orchestra, and gained a bit of notoriety in later years, appearing in commercials and on television shows based on her recognition as the &quot;Time Lady&quot;. As a result of her extensive work, she was an early member and a board member of the Atlanta branch of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.

Barbe and her husband created several hundred singing commercials (jingles). She performed on many of them. She also did voice-over work on TV and films, including the voice of Southern author Margaret Mitchell in the 1988 documentary &quot;The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind&quot;.

On September 26, 2015, both she and her husband were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Barbe died from cancer in Roswell, Georgia, on July 18, 2003. She was 74 years old, 11 days short of her 75th birthday. She was survived by her husband John Barbe, her daughter Susan Stubin, her son David Barbe, and seven grandchildren.

<text>Jean Leray (; 7 November 1906 – 10 November 1998) was a French mathematician, who worked on both partial differential equations and algebraic topology.

==Life and career==
He was born in Chantenay-sur-Loire (today part of Nantes). He studied at École Normale Supérieure from 1926 to 1929. He received his Ph.D. in 1933. In 1934 Leray published an important paper that founded the study of weak solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. In the same year, he and Juliusz Schauder discovered a topological invariant, now called the Leray–Schauder degree, which they applied to prove the existence of solutions for partial differential equations lacking uniqueness.

From 1938 to 1939 he was professor at the University of Nancy. He did not join the Bourbaki group, although he was close with its founders.

His main work in topology was carried out while he was in a prisoner of war camp in Edelbach, Austria from 1940 to 1945. He concealed his expertise on differential equations, fearing that its connections with applied mathematics could lead him to be asked to do war work.

Leray&#x27;s work of this period proved seminal to the development of spectral sequences and sheaves. These were subsequently developed by many others, each separately becoming an important tool in homological algebra.

He returned to work on partial differential equations from about 1950.

He was professor at the University of Paris from 1945 to 1947, and then at the Collège de France until 1978.

He was awarded the Malaxa Prize (Romania, 1938), the Grand Prix in mathematical sciences (French Academy of Sciences, 1940), the Feltrinelli Prize (Accademia dei Lincei, 1971), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (Israel, 1979), and the Lomonosov Gold Medal (Moscow, 1988). He was an elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1959 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1965.

<text>A protoplanetary disk is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust surrounding a young newly formed star, a T Tauri star, or Herbig Ae/Be star. The protoplanetary disk may not be considered an accretion disk; while the two are similar, an accretion disk is hotter and spins much faster. It is also found on black holes, not stars. This process should not be confused with the accretion process thought to build up the planets themselves. Externally illuminated photo-evaporating protoplanetary disks are called proplyds.

==Formation==
Protostars form from molecular clouds consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen. When a portion of a molecular cloud reaches a critical size, mass, or density, it begins to collapse under its own gravity. As this collapsing cloud, called a solar nebula, becomes denser, random gas motions originally present in the cloud average out in favor of the direction of the nebula&#x27;s net angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum causes the rotation to increase as the nebula radius decreases. This rotation causes the cloud to flatten out—much like forming a flat pizza out of dough—and take the form of a disk. This occurs because centripetal acceleration from the orbital motion resists the gravitational pull of the star only in the radial direction, but the cloud remains free to collapse in the axial direction. The outcome is the formation of a thin disc supported by gas pressure in the axial direction. The initial collapse takes about 100,000 years. After that time the star reaches a surface temperature similar to that of a main sequence star of the same mass and becomes visible.

It is now a T Tauri star. Accretion of gas onto the star continues for another 10 million years, before the disk disappears, perhaps being blown away by the young star&#x27;s stellar wind, or perhaps simply ceasing to emit radiation after accretion has ended. The oldest protoplanetary disk yet discovered is 25 million years old.

Protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars differ from the disks surrounding the primary components of close binary systems with respect to their size and temperature. Protoplanetary disks have radii up to 1000 AU, and only their innermost parts reach temperatures above 1000 K. They are very often accompanied by jets.

Protoplanetary disks have been observed around several young stars in our galaxy. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown proplyds and planetary disks to be forming within the Orion Nebula.

Protoplanetary disks are thought to be thin structures, with a typical vertical height much smaller than the radius, and a typical mass much smaller than the central young star.

The mass of a typical proto-planetary disk is dominated by its gas, however, the presence of dust grains has a major role in its evolution. Dust grains shield the mid-plane of the disk from energetic radiation from outer space that creates a dead zone in which the magnetorotational instability (MRI) no longer operates.

It is believed that these disks consist of a turbulent envelope of plasma, also called the active zone, that encases an extensive region of quiescent gas called the dead zone. The dead zone located at the mid-plane can slow down the flow of matter through the disk which prohibits achieving a steady state.
==Planetary system==
The nebular hypothesis of solar system formation describes how protoplanetary disks are thought to evolve into planetary systems. Electrostatic and gravitational interactions may cause the dust and ice grains in the disk to accrete into planetesimals. This process competes against the stellar wind, which drives the gas out of the system, and gravity (accretion) and internal stresses (viscosity), which pulls material into the central T Tauri star. Planetesimals constitute the building blocks of both terrestrial and giant planets.

Some of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are believed to have formed from smaller, circumplanetary analogs of the protoplanetary disks. The formation of planets and moons in geometrically thin, gas- and dust-rich disks is the reason why the planets are arranged in an ecliptic plane. Tens of millions of years after the formation of the Solar System, the inner few AU of the Solar System likely contained dozens of moon- to Mars-sized bodies that were accreting and consolidating into the terrestrial planets that we now see. The Earth&#x27;s moon likely formed after a Mars-sized protoplanet obliquely impacted the proto-Earth ~30 million years after the formation of the Solar System.

==Debris disks==
Gas-poor disks of circumstellar dust have been found around many nearby stars—most of which have ages in the range of ~10 million years (e.g. Beta Pictoris, 51 Ophiuchi) to billions of years (e.g. Tau Ceti). These systems are usually referred to as &quot;debris disks&quot;. Given the older ages of these stars, and the short lifetimes of micrometer-sized dust grains around stars due to Poynting Robertson drag, collisions, and radiation pressure (typically hundreds to thousands of years), it is thought that this dust is from the collisions of planetesimals (e.g. asteroids, comets). Hence the debris disks around these examples (e.g. Vega, Alphecca, Fomalhaut, etc.) are not &quot;protoplanetary&quot;, but represent a later stage of disk evolution where extrasolar analogs of the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt are home to dust-generating collisions between planetesimals.

==Relation to abiogenesis==

Based on recent computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. (Also see Extraterrestrial organic molecules.)

<doc id="245434" wikidata="Q24020774" url="?curid=245434" title="Proplyd">
<text>A proplyd, short for ionized protoplanetary disk, is an externally illuminated photoevaporating protoplanetary disk around a young star. Nearly 180 proplyds have been discovered in the Orion Nebula. Images of proplyds in other star-forming regions are rare, while Orion is the only region with a large known sample due to its relative proximity to Earth.

== History ==
In 1979 observations with the Lallemand electronic camera at the Pic-du-Midi Observatory showed six unresolved high-ionization sources near the Trapezium Cluster. These sources were not interpreted as proplyds, but as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that these objects are being ionized from the outside by M42. Later observations with the Very Large Array showed solar-system-sized condensations associated with these sources. Here the idea appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by an evaporating protostellar accretion disk.

Proplyds were clearly resolved in 1993 using images of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera and the term &quot;proplyd&quot; was used.

== Characteristics ==

In the Orion Nebula the proplyds observed are usually one of two types. Some proplyds glow around luminous stars, in cases where the disk is found close to the star, glowing from the star&#x27;s luminosity. Other proplyds are found at a greater distance from the host star and instead show up as dark silhouettes due to the self-obscuration of cooler dust and gases from the disk itself. Some proplyds show signs of movement from solar irradiance shock waves pushing the proplyds. The Orion Nebula is approximately 1,500 light-years from the Sun with very active star formation. The Orion Nebula and the Sun are in the same spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

A proplyd may form new planets and planetesimal systems. Current models show that the metallicity of the star and proplyd, along with the correct planetary system temperature and distance from the star, are keys to planet and planetesimal formation. To date, the Solar System, with 8 planets, 5 dwarf planets and 5 planetesimal systems, is the largest planetary system found. Most proplyds develop into a system with no planetesimal systems, or into one very large planetesimal system.

== Proplyds in other star-forming regions ==

Photoevaporating proplyds in other star forming regions were found with the Hubble Space Telescope. NGC 1977 currently represents the star-forming region with the largest number of proplyds outside of the Orion Nebula, with 7 confirmed proplyds. It was also the first instance where a B-type star, 42 Orionis is responsible for the photoevaporation. In addition, 4 clear and 4 candidate proplyds were discovered in the very young region NGC 2024, two of which have been photoevaporated by a B star. The NGC 2024 proplyds are significant because they imply that external photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks could compete even with very early planet formation (within the first half a million years).

Another type of photoevaporating proplyd was discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These cometary tails represent dust being pulled away from the disks. Westerhout 5 is a region with many dusty proplyds, especially around HD 17505. These dusty proplyds are depleted of any gas in the outer regions of the disk, but the photoevaporation could leave an inner, more robust, and possibly gas-rich disk component of radius 5-10 astronomical units.

The proplyds in the Orion Nebula and other star-forming regions represent proto-planetary disks around low-mass stars being externally photoevaporated. These low-mass proplyds are usually found within 0.3 parsec (60,000 astronomical units) of the massive OB star and the dusty proplyds have tails with a length of 0.1 to 0.2 parsec (20,000 to 40,000 au). There is a proposed type of intermediate massive counterpart, called proplyd-like objects. Objects in NGC 3603 and later in Cygnus OB2 were proposed as intermediate massive versions of the bright proplyds found in the Orion Nebula. The proplyd-like objects in Cygnus OB2 for example are 6 to 14 parsec distant to a large collection of OB stars and have tail lengths of 0.11 to 0.55 parsec (24,000 to 113,000 au). The nature of proplyd-like objects as intermediate massive proplyds is partly supported by a spectrum for one object, which showed that the mass loss rate is higher than the mass accretion rate. Another object did not show any outflow, but accretion.

<doc id="245437" wikidata="Q193507" url="?curid=245437" title="Saint Christopher">
<text>Saint Christopher (, , ; ) is venerated by several Christian denominations. According to these traditions, he was a martyr killed in the reign of the 3rd-century Roman emperor Decius (), or alternatively under the emperor Maximinus Daia (). Churches and monasteries were named after him by the 7th century. There is no evidence for the historicity of the saint.

The most famous legend connected to the saint recounts that after converting to Christianity, he devoted his life to carrying travelers across a river. One day he carried an unknown young boy across a river after which the boy revealed himself as Christ. Because of his help to travelers, he became the patron saint of travelers. In the iconography of the Western Church, the saint is often depicted as a giant with a staff carrying the infant Jesus across a river on his shoulders. Small images of him are often worn around the neck, on a bracelet, carried in a pocket, or placed in vehicles. He is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. The Eastern Church tradition depicts the saint as a cynocephalus (&#x27;dog-headed creature&#x27;) in a literal interpretation of its legendary tradition.

== Legend ==
Legends about the life and death of Saint Christopher first appeared in Greece in the 6th century and had spread to France by the 9th century. The 11th-century bishop and poet Walter of Speyer gave one version, but the most popular variations originated from the 13th-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

According to the legendary account of his life Christopher was initially called . He was a Canaanite, 5 cubits () tall and with a fearsome face. While serving the king of Canaan, he took it into his head to go and serve &quot;the greatest king there was&quot;. He went to the king who was reputed to be the greatest, but one day he saw the king cross himself at the mention of the devil. On thus learning that the king feared the devil, he departed to look for the devil. He came across a band of marauders, one of whom declared himself to be the devil, so Christopher decided to serve him. But when he saw his new master avoid a wayside cross and found out that the devil feared Christ, he left him and enquired from people where to find Christ. He met a hermit who instructed him in the Christian faith. Christopher asked him how he could serve Christ. When the hermit suggested fasting and prayer, Christopher replied that he was unable to perform that service. The hermit then suggested that because of his size and strength Christopher could serve Christ by assisting people to cross a dangerous river, where they were perishing in the attempt. The hermit promised that this service would be pleasing to Christ.

After Christopher had performed this service for some time, a little child asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, he said to the child: &quot;You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were.&quot; The child replied: &quot;You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work.&quot; The child then vanished.

Christopher later visited Lycia and there comforted the Christians who were being martyred. Brought before the local king, he refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods. The king tried to win him by riches and by sending two beautiful women to tempt him. Christopher converted the women to Christianity, as he had already converted thousands in the city. The king ordered him to be killed. Various attempts failed, but finally Christopher was beheaded.

The name &quot;Christopher&quot;, as used in the Anglophone world, is the English version of the Greek name ( or ). It is formed from the word elements (, &#x27;Christ&#x27;), and (, &#x27;to bear&#x27;), together signifying, &quot;Christ bearer&quot;. Widely dispersed into other languages and cultures from the Greek, many native forms of &quot;Christopher&quot; are used both to refer to the saint and as a personal name.
==Veneration and patronage==
===Eastern Orthodox liturgy===
The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Christopher of Lycea (or Lycia) with a Feast Day on 9 May. The liturgical reading and hymns refer to his imprisonment by Decius who tempts Christopher with prostitutes before ordering his beheading. The Kontakion in the Fourth Tone (hymn) reads:
Thou who wast terrifying both in strength and in countenance, for thy Creator&#x27;s sake thou didst surrender thyself willingly to them that sought thee; for thou didst persuade both them and the women that sought to arouse in thee the fire of lust, and they followed thee in the path of martyrdom. And in torments thou didst prove to be courageous. Wherefore, we have gained thee as our great protector, O great Christopher.

===Roman Catholic liturgy===
The Roman Martyrology remembers him on 25 July. The Tridentine calendar commemorates him on the same day only in private Masses. By 1954 his commemoration had been extended to all Masses, but it was dropped in 1970 as part of the general reorganization of the calendar of the Roman rite as mandated by the motu proprio, &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot;. His commemoration is of Roman tradition, in view of the relatively late date (about 1550) and limited manner in which it was accepted into the Roman calendar, but his feast continues to be observed locally.

== Churches and monasteries dedicated to the Saint ==
A stone inscription of was found in the ruins of a church in the ruins of the ancient city Chalcedon near present-day Istanbul. The inscription bears witness to the laying of the foundation stone, the construction and the consecration of a church in the name of &quot;Saint Christopher&#x27;s Martyrdom&quot;. The inscription states that this Church of St Christopher dates back to the time of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, the Council of Chalcedon. The inscription also mentions the names of the state ministers of the Byzantine Empire and those church ministers who were involved in the laying of the foundation stone, the construction or the consecration of the church. The inscription attests to the veneration of Saint Christopher in Chalcedon in the 5th century.

A nunnery in Galatia was consecrated to Saint Christopher around the year 600.

===Relics===
The Museum of Sacred Art at Saint Justine&#x27;s Church (Sveta Justina) in Rab, Croatia claims a gold-plated reliquary holds the skull of St. Christopher. According to church tradition, a bishop showed the relics from the city wall in 1075 in order to end a siege of the city by an Italo-Norman army.

The Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik holds a relic which is claimed to be the incorrupt leg of the saint. It was brought over in 1484 from Constantinople through Corfu and originally intended to be transferred to Korčula. The feast day of Saint Christopher is celebrated on 27 July in Šibenik.

Greek Orthodox churches in Grevena, Filothei, and Siatista hold other relics of the saint.
====Saint Christopher&#x27;s &quot;gigantic tooth&quot;====
In the Late Middle Ages, a claimed large tooth of St. Christopher was delivered to the church in Vercelli. Pilgrims came from all over Europe to look at this relic until the end of 18th century when a naturalist determined it was a tooth of a hippopotamus. The tooth was then removed from the altar and its veneration prohibited.

===Medals===
Devotional medals with St. Christopher&#x27;s name and image are commonly worn as pendants, especially by travelers, to show devotion and as a request for his blessing. Miniature statues are frequently displayed in automobiles. In French a widespread phrase for such medals is (&quot;Look at St Christopher and go on reassured&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;Behold St Christopher and go your way in safety&quot;); Saint Christopher medals and holy cards in Spanish have the phrase (&quot;If you trust St. Christopher, you won&#x27;t die in an accident&quot;).

===General patronage===
St. Christopher was a widely popular saint, especially revered by athletes, mariners, ferrymen, and travelers. He is revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He holds patronage of things related to travel and travelers—against lightning and pestilence—and patronage for archers; bachelors; boatmen; soldiers; bookbinders; epilepsy; floods; fruit dealers; fullers; gardeners; a holy death; mariners; market carriers; motorists and drivers; sailors; storms; surfers; toothache; mountaineering; and transportation workers.
===Patronage of places===
Christopher is the patron saint of many places, including: Baden, Germany; Barga, Italy; Brunswick, Germany; Mecklenburg, Germany; Rab, Croatia; Roermond, the Netherlands; Saint Christopher&#x27;s Island (Saint Kitts); Toses, Catalonia, Spain; Mondim de Basto, Portugal; Agrinio, Greece; Vilnius, Lithuania; Riga, Latvia; Havana, Cuba; San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic; Paete, Laguna, Philippines; and Tivim, Goa, India.

====Toponomy====
Numerous places are named for the saint, including Saint Christopher Island, the official name of the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and St. Christopher Island in Antarctica. Many places are named after the saint in other languages, for example is a common French place name; similarly, is a place name in many Spanish-speaking or Spanish-influenced countries, and the is in use throughout the Lusophone world.

===Iconography===
Because St. Christopher offered protection to travelers and against sudden death, many churches placed images or statues of him, usually opposite the south door, so he could be easily seen. He is usually depicted as a giant, with a child on his shoulder and a staff in one hand. In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the British Archaeological Association, reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, certain icons identify Saint Christopher with the head of a dog. Such images may carry echoes of the Egyptian dog-headed god, Anubis. Because of the association of the representation of dog-headed saint with stories of werewolves or of monstrous races, the Russian Orthodox Church forbid the depiction of the saint with a dog head in the 18th century.

The roots of that iconography lie in a hagiographic narrative set during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, which tells of a man named &quot;Reprebus&quot;, (also, &quot;Rebrebus&quot; or &quot;Reprobus&quot;; &#x27;the reprobate&#x27; or &#x27;scoundrel&#x27;). He was captured by Roman forces fighting against tribes dwelling to the west of Egypt in Cyrenaica and forced to join the Roman (&#x27;Unit of the Marmaritae&#x27;). He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man. This was in line with the cultural beliefs of the time, which held that typical Marmaritae were tall, strong, and rascally; being a cynocephalus was also consistent with this image. Roman writer Pliny the Elder reported that the &quot; , of Ethiopia were men with the heads of dogs.&quot; Pliny&#x27;s work, The Natural History was, during the first century A.D., a well-respected compendium of Roman science. It reports accepted &quot;knowledge&quot; about people from Cyrenaica. Pliny notes that these &quot;dog-headed men&quot; resided in &quot;Ethiopia&quot;—a name used to encapsulate areas of Africa West and South of Alexandrian Egypt by contemporary Romans. Reprebus and the unit were later transferred to Syrian Antioch, where bishop Peter of Attalia baptised him and where he was martyred in 308.

Scholars have suggested that the Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed may have resulted from his identification as a member of the tribe of the Marmaritae who were a land of cannibals and dog-headed peoples. The Greek tradition interpreted this literally, which led to Byzantine icons often depicting St. Christopher with a dog&#x27;s head. The Latin tradition moved in the opposite direction away from a literal translation of the original Greek term &quot;dog-headed&quot; (kunokephalos). The Latin tradition may have translated the term as &quot;dog-like&quot; (canineus). This later evolved into a misreading as the Latin term , &#x27;Canaanite&#x27;, thus turning Christopher into a Canaanite.

According to the medieval Irish Passion of St. Christopher, &quot;This Christopher was one of the Dog-heads, a race that had the heads of dogs and ate human flesh.&quot; It was commonly accepted at the time that there were several types of races, the Cynocephalus, or dog-headed people, being one of many believed to populate the world. The German bishop and poet Walter of Speyer portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an athlete of God, one of the soldier saints.

<doc id="245453" wikidata="Q7793467" url="?curid=245453" title="Thomas Reilly (Massachusetts politician)">
<text>Thomas Francis Reilly (born February 14, 1942) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 45th Massachusetts Attorney General. He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts to Irish immigrant parents.

He was one of three candidates who sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Massachusetts in the 2006 election. Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick won the party&#x27;s nomination and the general election, defeating Reilly and businessman Chris Gabrieli.

==Early life==
A native of Springfield, Massachusetts, he described himself as a &quot;misguided youth&quot; the year his father, Mortimer &quot;Murty&quot; Reilly, was found dead at home from a heart attack when Reilly was 16. He was arrested for public drunkenness when he was 20. By age 22, he was focused with driving ambition, much to the credit of his friend Wayne Budd&#x27;s father, an ex-Marine turned policeman in Springfield who took him under his wing and encouraged him to go to school.

==Education==
Reilly attended Cathedral High School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1959. After graduating high school, he went off to college in Nova Scotia at St. Francis Xavier University. He stayed there only a year, transferring to American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he graduated on June 7, 1964. He received a Bachelor of Arts in economics.

==Personal life==
In July 1966, Reilly married Ruth Gammons (b. 1941), now a retired schoolteacher. The couple have three children.

==Later life and legal career==
He moved to Washington, D.C., and worked for two years with the Central Intelligence Agency. For one year, Reilly lived in Dearborn, Michigan, where he worked with the Ford Motor Company as a Labor Relations Representative until 1967. He attended Boston College Law School and received his JD in June 1970.

Reilly worked for two years as a prosecutor in the state Attorney General&#x27;s civil rights division. He worked for four years as a Suffolk County prosecutor. In 1976, Reilly and Budd formed &quot;Budd and Reilly&quot;, a Boston-based law firm. The firm became the largest minority-dominated firm in New England.

==Political career==
From 1978 to 1985 he served on the Watertown Licensing Board in Watertown, Massachusetts.

He left the law firm in 1983 to work in Middlesex County District Attorney Scott Harshbarger&#x27;s administration as First Assistant District Attorney. In 1990, Reilly was elected Middlesex County District Attorney. He was reelected for a second term.

He ran for attorney general in 1998 against state Senator Lois Pines and won the Democratic Primary. He defeated Republican Brad Bailey in the November election.

In the winter of 2001–02, he conducted a &quot;very public investigation&quot; into the sale of the Boston Red Sox to a group led by John W. Henry. Reilly made &quot;negative comments about the process, Major League Baseball&#x27;s involvement in the sale, and threatened to block the transaction. Eventually the Red Sox limited partners, the Henry/Werner group, and Reilly negotiated a settlement, in which Reilly agreed to allow the sale to proceed, the Henry/Werner group agreed to create their own charitable foundation, and the Red Sox limited partners agreed to give $10 million more to the Yawkey Foundation.&quot; The existence of &quot;higher bids from Charles F. Dolan ($750 million), chairman of Cablevision, and a group headed by Miles Prentice ($755 million)&quot; were the apparent pretext for Reilly&#x27;s involvement, as the winning bid from Henry&#x27;s group only totalled $660 million.

He was reelected for a second term in 2002.

On November 30, 2005, he said that he was conducting an investigation of Sony BMG over their use of the XCP digital rights management on Sony audio CDs.

In January 2006, he came under fire for allegedly impeding an investigation into an October 2005 automobile crash which left two Southborough, Massachusetts teens dead, and another teen injured.

He has come under fire from gun rights advocates for allegedly abusing his regulatory authority for political purposes.

On January 24, 2006, Reilly officially kicked off his first gubernatorial campaign in Springfield at his alma mater American International College. He finished third in the primary on September 19, 2006. His opponent, Deval Patrick, went on to win the general election.

==Post-political career==
He served as president and later a member of the board of directors of the Watertown Boys &amp; Girls Club. He now serves as special counsel with the law firm of Hunton Andrews Kurth.

In 2018 he was handpicked by the Massachusetts State Police to lead an investigation into a car crash that occurred on August 24, 2017, in Reading, Massachusetts.

<text>Baiji (; also spelled Bayji) is a city of about 173,677 inhabitants in Salah ad Din governorate in northern Iraq. It is located some 130 miles (209 km) north of Baghdad, on the main road to Mosul. It is a major industrial centre best known for its oil refinery, the biggest in Iraq, and has a large power plant. With regards to transport in the area, Baiji is a junction of the national railway network.

== History ==
After the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, dozens of British civilians taken captive in Kuwait were held at the Baiji oil refinery, apparently as human shields. The city was bombed during the 1991 Gulf War and about 80% of the oil refinery was destroyed. It was quickly rebuilt and was back in action only a couple of months after the war&#x27;s end. However, a lack of maintenance and spare parts resulting from the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq caused the deterioration of the city&#x27;s oil refinery, which by the late 1990s was in a very poor condition and was seriously polluting the surrounding area.

=== Iraq War (2003–11) ===

Baiji was captured with little or no fighting during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. It was briefly thought in late April 2003 that barrels of chemicals found in a storage area near the town contained the nerve agent cyclosarin. Soon afterwards, United States troops discovered an underground oil refinery at Baiji which was initially suspected to be a chemical weapons plant. Both leads eventually proved to be false alarms in the search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.

Following the invasion, Baiji subsequently became the scene of a number of insurgent attacks. The town is at one end of the &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot; region which provided the bedrock of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s support. The sprawling oil refinery and pipelines have been particularly difficult to protect against guerrillas. There have been repeated attacks on the oil pipelines and other elements of the oil infrastructure.

In October 2003, violent riots broke out in the town in protest against the US-backed police force, which was accused of corruption. US troops restored order, wounding four Iraqis in the process, and sacked the town&#x27;s police chief, replacing him with a local man elected by tribal elders. A US soldier was killed in the town on October 12. US troops subsequently conducted a number of raids in the town to root out guerrillas, who were publicly supported by some of Baiji&#x27;s clergy. It was also thought that Saddam Hussein might be hiding in Baiji, prompting raids to find him, before he was eventually captured in December 2003 in the nearby village of ad-Dawr.

In May 2007, a Joint Security Station (JSS) was established in Baiji named &quot;JSS Arvanitis-Sigua&quot; after two US Paratroopers who lost their lives in combat in Bayji.

In April 2009, the Joint Coordination Center (JCC) opened within the JSS. The function of the JCC is to enable the coordination of Iraqi municipal agencies thereby building the Government&#x27;s capacity to provide essential services to the approximately 250,000 residents of the greater Baiji area.

=== 2014 ISIS offensive ===

On 11 June 2014, ISIL insurgents advanced into Baiji, seizing the main court house and police station and setting them on fire. The militants, who were travelling in a group of around 60 vehicles, also took control of the Baiji prison and freed all the inmates within. Local residents told members of the media that ISIS sent a group of local tribal chiefs ahead of them to convince the 250 guards at the oil plant to withdraw, while soldiers and police had been warned to leave as well. Later in the day, militants reportedly retreated from Baiji either due to persuasion from local tribal leaders or due to reinforcements from the Iraqi Army&#x27;s Fourth Armored Division arriving in the city. However, the next day it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of the town, except the refinery which was surrounded.

On 18 June, ISIL attacked the refinery with mortars and machine guns. An official from inside the refinery stated the militants had captured 75 percent of the facility, while a military spokesman claimed the attack had been repelled with 40 insurgents being killed.

On 19 June, Iraqi government forces claimed to have regained full control of the Baiji oil refinery, after heavy fighting with that left 100 militants dead. An Iraqi witness who drove past the Baiji refinery told the Associated Press that ISIL had hung their banners from the watch towers and created checkpoints surrounding the facility, despite government claims of control.

On 20 June, the town was still under complete control of the militants while the oil refinery was surrounded by ISIL forces and had once again come under attack.

=== 2014 Army counteroffensive ===

On 7 November 2014, Iraqi forces retook control of most of the strategic city Baiji from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. At the time, government troops reportedly held more than 70 percent of the city—including neighborhoods in the south, east and north—and were battling to capture the rest.

On 14 November 2014, Iraqi officials said their forces had driven out ISIL fighters from the oil refinery city of Baiji, 209 km (130 miles) north of Baghdad. Gen Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi told Iraqi state TV that the city &quot;had been completely liberated&quot;.

Heavy fighting subsequently continued, and control of Baiji oscillated between both sides until 29 October 2015, when Iraqi government control of the city was fully restored, and the armed forces announced the complete liberation of the city.

<text>In mathematics, a sheaf (: sheaves) is a tool for systematically tracking data (such as sets, abelian groups, rings) attached to the open sets of a topological space and defined locally with regard to them. For example, for each open set, the data could be the ring of continuous functions defined on that open set. Such data are well-behaved in that they can be restricted to smaller open sets, and also the data assigned to an open set are equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original open set (intuitively, every datum is the sum of its constituent data).

The field of mathematics that studies sheaves is called sheaf theory.

Sheaves are understood conceptually as general and abstract objects. Their precise definition is rather technical. They are specifically defined as sheaves of sets or as [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves of rings]], for example, depending on the type of data assigned to the open sets.

There are also maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a specific type, such as sheaves of abelian groups) with their morphisms on a fixed topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each continuous map there is associated both a direct image functor, taking sheaves and their morphisms on the domain to sheaves and morphisms on the codomain, and an inverse image functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.

Due to their general nature and versatility, sheaves have several applications in topology and especially in algebraic and differential geometry. First, geometric structures such as that of a differentiable manifold or a scheme can be expressed in terms of a sheaf of rings on the space. In such contexts, several geometric constructions such as vector bundles or divisors are naturally specified in terms of sheaves. Second, sheaves provide the framework for a very general cohomology theory, which encompasses also the &quot;usual&quot; topological cohomology theories such as singular cohomology. Especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, sheaf cohomology provides a powerful link between topological and geometric properties of spaces. Sheaves also provide the basis for the theory of &quot;D&quot;-modules, which provide applications to the theory of differential equations. In addition, generalisations of sheaves to more general settings than topological spaces, such as Grothendieck topology, have provided applications to mathematical logic and to number theory.

== Definitions and examples ==

In many mathematical branches, several structures defined on a topological space formula_1 (e.g., a differentiable manifold) can be naturally &quot;localised&quot; or &quot;restricted&quot; to open subsets formula_2: typical examples include continuous real-valued or complex-valued functions, formula_3-times differentiable (real-valued or complex-valued) functions, bounded real-valued functions, vector fields, and sections of any vector bundle on the space. The ability to restrict data to smaller open subsets gives rise to the concept of presheaves. Roughly speaking, sheaves are then those presheaves, where local data can be glued to global data.

=== Presheaves ===
Let formula_1 be a topological space. A &quot;presheaf formula_5 of sets&quot; on formula_1 consists of the following data:
*For each open set formula_7, there exists a set formula_8. This set is also denoted formula_9. The elements in this set are called the &quot;sections&quot; of formula_10 over formula_11. The sections of formula_10 over formula_1 are called the &quot;global sections&quot; of formula_10.
*For each inclusion of open sets formula_15, a function formula_16. In view of many of the examples below, the morphisms formula_17 are called &quot;restriction morphisms&quot;. If formula_18, then its restriction formula_19 is often denoted formula_20 by analogy with restriction of functions.
The restriction morphisms are required to satisfy two additional (functorial) properties:
*For every open set formula_11 of formula_1, the restriction morphism formula_23 is the identity morphism on formula_8.
*If we have three open sets formula_25, then the composite formula_26
Informally, the second axiom says it does not matter whether we restrict to formula_27 in one step or restrict first to formula_28, then to formula_27. A concise functorial reformulation of this definition is given further below.

Many examples of presheaves come from different classes of functions: to any &quot;formula_11&quot;, one can assign the set formula_31 of continuous real-valued functions on &quot;formula_11&quot;. The restriction maps are then just given by restricting a continuous function on &quot;formula_11&quot; to a smaller open subset &quot;formula_34&quot;, which again is a continuous function. The two presheaf axioms are immediately checked, thereby giving an example of a presheaf. This can be extended to a presheaf of holomorphic functions formula_35 and a presheaf of smooth functions formula_36.

Another common class of examples is assigning to formula_11 the set of constant real-valued functions on formula_11. This presheaf is called the &quot;constant presheaf&quot; associated to formula_39 and is denoted formula_40.

=== Sheaves ===
Given a presheaf, a natural question to ask is to what extent its sections over an open set &quot;formula_11&quot; are specified by their restrictions to open subsets of formula_11. A &quot;sheaf&quot; is a presheaf whose sections are, in a technical sense, uniquely determined by their restrictions.

Axiomatically, a &quot;sheaf&quot; is a presheaf that satisfies both of the following axioms:
# (&quot;Locality&quot;) Suppose formula_11 is an open set, formula_44 is an open cover of formula_11 with formula_46 for all formula_47, and formula_48 are sections. If formula_49 for all formula_50, then formula_51.
# (&quot;Gluing&quot;) Suppose formula_11 is an open set, formula_44 is an open cover of formula_11 with formula_46 for all formula_47, and formula_57 is a family of sections. If all pairs of sections agree on the overlap of their domains, that is, if formula_58 for all formula_59, then there exists a section formula_18 such that formula_61 for all formula_50.

In both of these axioms, the hypothesis on the open cover is equivalent to the assumption that formula_63.

The section &quot;formula_64&quot; whose existence is guaranteed by axiom 2 is called the &quot;gluing&quot;, &quot;concatenation&quot;, or &quot;collation&quot; of the sections formula_65. By axiom 1 it is unique. Sections &quot;formula_65&quot; and &quot;formula_67&quot; satisfying the agreement precondition of axiom 2 are often called &quot;compatible&quot; ; thus axioms 1 and 2 together state that &quot;any collection of pairwise compatible sections can be uniquely glued together&quot;. A &quot;separated presheaf&quot;, or &quot;monopresheaf&quot;, is a presheaf satisfying axiom 1.

The presheaf consisting of continuous functions mentioned above is a sheaf. This assertion reduces to checking that, given continuous functions formula_68 which agree on the intersections formula_69, there is a unique continuous function formula_70 whose restriction equals the formula_71. By contrast, the constant presheaf is usually &quot;not&quot; a sheaf as it fails to satisfy the locality axiom on the empty set (this is explained in more detail at constant sheaf).

Presheaves and sheaves are typically denoted by capital letters, formula_72 being particularly common, presumably for the French word for sheaf, &quot;faisceau&quot;. Use of calligraphic letters such as formula_10 is also common.

It can be shown that to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a basis for the topology of the underlying space. Moreover, it can also be shown that it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms above relative to the open sets of a covering. This observation is used to construct another example which is crucial in algebraic geometry, namely quasi-coherent sheaves. Here the topological space in question is the spectrum of a commutative ring formula_74, whose points are the prime ideals formula_75 in formula_74. The open sets formula_77 form a basis for the Zariski topology on this space. Given an formula_74-module formula_79, there is a sheaf, denoted by formula_80 on the formula_81, that satisfies
:formula_82 the localization of formula_79 at formula_84.

There is another characterization of sheaves that is equivalent to the previously discussed.
A presheaf formula_10 is a sheaf if and only if for any open formula_11 and any open cover formula_87 of formula_11, formula_8 is the fibre product formula_90. This characterization is useful in construction of sheaves, for example, if formula_91 are abelian sheaves, then the kernel of sheaves morphism formula_92 is a sheaf, since projective limits commutes with projective limits. On the other hand, the cokernel is not always a sheaf because inductive limit not necessarily commutes with projective limits. One of the way to fix this is to consider Noetherian topological spaces; every open sets are compact so that the cokernel is a sheaf, since finite projective limits commutes with inductive limits.

=== Further examples ===

==== Sheaf of sections of a continuous map ====
Any continuous map formula_93 of topological spaces determines a sheaf formula_94 on formula_1 by setting
:formula_96
Any such formula_64 is commonly called a section of &quot;formula_84&quot;, and this example is the reason why the elements in formula_8 are generally called sections. This construction is especially important when formula_84 is the projection of a fiber bundle onto its base space. For example, the sheaves of smooth functions are the sheaves of sections of the trivial bundle. 

Another example: the sheaf of sections of
:formula_101
is the sheaf which assigns to any &quot;formula_102&quot; the set of branches of the complex logarithm on &quot;formula_11&quot;.

Given a point formula_104 and an abelian group formula_105, the skyscraper sheaf formula_106 is defined as follows: if formula_11 is an open set containing formula_104, then formula_109. If formula_11 does not contain formula_104, then formula_112, the trivial group. The restriction maps are either the identity on formula_105, if both open sets contain formula_104, or the zero map otherwise.

==== Sheaves on manifolds ====
On an formula_3-dimensional formula_116-manifold formula_79, there are a number of important sheaves, such as the sheaf of formula_118-times continuously differentiable functions formula_119 (with formula_120). Its sections on some open formula_11 are the formula_122-functions formula_123. For formula_124, this sheaf is called the &quot;structure sheaf&quot; and is denoted formula_125. The nonzero formula_116 functions also form a sheaf, denoted formula_127. Differential forms (of degree formula_128) also form a sheaf formula_129. In all these examples, the restriction morphisms are given by restricting functions or forms.

The assignment sending formula_11 to the compactly supported functions on formula_11 is not a sheaf, since there is, in general, no way to preserve this property by passing to a smaller open subset. Instead, this forms a cosheaf, a dual concept where the restriction maps go in the opposite direction than with sheaves. However, taking the dual of these vector spaces does give a sheaf, the sheaf of distributions.

==== Presheaves that are not sheaves ====
In addition to the constant presheaf mentioned above, which is usually not a sheaf, there are further examples of presheaves that are not sheaves:
* Let formula_1 be the two-point topological space formula_133 with the discrete topology. Define a presheaf formula_72 as follows: formula_135The restriction map formula_136 is the projection of formula_137 onto its first coordinate, and the restriction map formula_138 is the projection of formula_137 onto its second coordinate. formula_72 is a presheaf that is not separated: a global section is determined by three numbers, but the values of that section over formula_141 and formula_142 determine only two of those numbers. So while we can glue any two sections over formula_141 and formula_142, we cannot glue them uniquely.
* Let formula_145 be the real line, and let formula_146 be the set of bounded continuous functions on formula_11. This is not a sheaf because it is not always possible to glue. For example, let formula_148 be the set of all formula_104 such that formula_150 is bounded on each formula_148. Consequently, we get a section formula_65 on formula_148. However, these sections do not glue, because the function formula_84 is not bounded on the real line. Consequently formula_72 is a presheaf, but not a sheaf. In fact, formula_72 is separated because it is a sub-presheaf of the sheaf of continuous functions.

=== Motivating sheaves from complex analytic spaces and algebraic geometry ===
One of the historical motivations for sheaves have come from studying complex manifolds, complex analytic geometry, and scheme theory from algebraic geometry. This is because in all of the previous cases, we consider a topological space formula_1 together with a structure sheaf formula_158 giving it the structure of a complex manifold, complex analytic space, or scheme. This perspective of equipping a topological space with a sheaf is essential to the theory of locally ringed spaces (see below).

==== Technical challenges with complex manifolds ====
One of the main historical motivations for introducing sheaves was constructing a device which keeps track of holomorphic functions on complex manifolds. For example, on a compact complex manifold formula_1 (like complex projective space or the vanishing locus in projective space of a homogeneous polynomial), the &quot;only&quot; holomorphic functionsformula_160are the constant functions. This means there exist two compact complex manifolds formula_161 which are not isomorphic, but nevertheless their rings of global holomorphic functions, denoted formula_162, are isomorphic. Contrast this with smooth manifolds where every manifold formula_79 can be embedded inside some formula_164, hence its ring of smooth functions formula_165 comes from restricting the smooth functions from formula_166. 

Another complexity when considering the ring of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold formula_1 is given a small enough open set formula_2, the holomorphic functions will be isomorphic to formula_169. Sheaves are a direct tool for dealing with this complexity since they make it possible to keep track of the holomorphic structure on the underlying topological space of formula_1 on arbitrary open subsets formula_2. This means as formula_11 becomes more complex topologically, the ring formula_173 can be expressed from gluing the formula_174. Note that sometimes this sheaf is denoted formula_175 or just formula_158, or even formula_177 when we want to emphasize the space the structure sheaf is associated to.

==== Tracking submanifolds with sheaves ====
Another common example of sheaves can be constructed by considering a complex submanifold formula_178. There is an associated sheaf formula_179 which takes an open subset formula_2 and gives the ring of holomorphic functions on formula_181. This kind of formalism was found to be extremely powerful and motivates a lot of homological algebra such as sheaf cohomology since an intersection theory can be built using these kinds of sheaves from the Serre intersection formula.

== Operations with sheaves ==

=== Morphisms ===
Morphisms of sheaves are, roughly speaking, analogous to functions between them. In contrast to a function between sets, which is simply an assignment of outputs to inputs, morphisms of sheaves are also required to be compatible with the local–global structures of the underlying sheaves. This idea is made precise in the following definition.

Let formula_10 and formula_183 be two sheaves of sets (respectively abelian groups, rings, etc.) on formula_1. A &quot;morphism&quot; formula_185 consists of a morphism formula_186 of sets (respectively abelian groups, rings, etc.) for each open set formula_11 of formula_1, subject to the condition that this morphism is compatible with restrictions. In other words, for every open subset formula_28 of an open set formula_11, the following diagram is commutative.

:formula_191

For example, taking the derivative gives a morphism of sheaves on formula_192, 
formula_193
Indeed, given an (formula_3-times continuously differentiable) function formula_195 (with formula_11 in formula_192 open), the restriction (to a smaller open subset formula_28) of its derivative equals the derivative of formula_199.

With this notion of morphism, sheaves of sets (respectively abelian groups, rings, etc.) on a fixed topological space formula_1 form a category. The general categorical notions of mono-, epi- and isomorphisms can therefore be applied to sheaves. 

A morphism formula_201 of sheaves on formula_202 is an isomorphism (respectively monomorphism) if and only if there exists an open cover formula_203 of formula_202 such that formula_205 are isomorphisms (respectively injective morphisms) of sets (respectively abelian groups, rings, etc.) for all formula_206. These statements give examples of how to work with sheaves using local information, but it&#x27;s important to note that we cannot check if a morphism of sheaves is an epimorphism in the same manner. Indeed the statement that maps on the level of open sets formula_207 are not always surjective for epimorphisms of sheaves is equivalent to non-exactness of the global sections functor—or equivalently, to non-triviality of sheaf cohomology.

=== Stalks of a sheaf ===
The &quot;stalk&quot; formula_208 of a sheaf formula_10 captures the properties of a sheaf &quot;around&quot; a point formula_210, generalizing the germs of functions.
Here, &quot;around&quot; means that, conceptually speaking, one looks at smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the point. Of course, no single neighborhood will be small enough, which requires considering a limit of some sort. More precisely, the stalk is defined by

:formula_211
the direct limit being over all open subsets of formula_1 containing the given point formula_104. In other words, an element of the stalk is given by a section over some open neighborhood of formula_104, and two such sections are considered equivalent if their restrictions agree on a smaller neighborhood.

The natural morphism formula_215 takes a section formula_64 in formula_8 to its &quot;germ&quot; formula_218 at formula_104. This generalises the usual definition of a germ.

In many situations, knowing the stalks of a sheaf is enough to control the sheaf itself. For example, whether or not a morphism of sheaves is a monomorphism, epimorphism, or isomorphism can be tested on the stalks. In this sense, a sheaf is determined by its stalks, which are a local data. By contrast, the &quot;global&quot; information present in a sheaf, i.e., the &quot;global sections&quot;, i.e., the sections formula_220 on the whole space formula_1, typically carry less information. For example, for a compact complex manifold formula_1, the global sections of the sheaf of holomorphic functions are just formula_223, since any holomorphic function
:formula_224
is constant by Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

=== Turning a presheaf into a sheaf ===
It is frequently useful to take the data contained in a presheaf and to express it as a sheaf. It turns out that there is a best possible way to do this. It takes a presheaf formula_10 and produces a new sheaf formula_226 called the &quot;sheafification&quot; or &quot;sheaf associated to the presheaf&quot; formula_10. For example, the sheafification of the constant presheaf (see above) is called the &quot;constant sheaf&quot;. Despite its name, its sections are &quot;locally&quot; constant functions.

The sheaf formula_226 can be constructed using the étalé space formula_229 of formula_10, namely as the sheaf of sections of the map
:formula_231
Another construction of the sheaf formula_226 proceeds by means of a functor formula_233 from presheaves to presheaves that gradually improves the properties of a presheaf: for any presheaf formula_10, formula_235 is a separated presheaf, and for any separated presheaf formula_10, formula_235 is a sheaf. The associated sheaf formula_226 is given by formula_239.

The idea that the sheaf formula_226 is the best possible approximation to formula_10 by a sheaf is made precise using the following universal property: there is a natural morphism of presheaves formula_242 so that for any sheaf formula_183 and any morphism of presheaves formula_244, there is a unique morphism of sheaves formula_245 such that formula_246. In fact, formula_247 is the left adjoint functor to the inclusion functor (or forgetful functor) from the category of sheaves to the category of presheaves, and formula_248 is the unit of the adjunction. In this way, the category of sheaves turns into a Giraud subcategory of presheaves. This categorical situation is the reason why the sheafification functor appears in constructing cokernels of sheaf morphisms or tensor products of sheaves, but not for kernels, say.

=== Subsheaves, quotient sheaves ===
If formula_249 is a subsheaf of a sheaf formula_72 of abelian groups, then the quotient sheaf formula_251 is the sheaf associated to the presheaf formula_252; in other words, the quotient sheaf fits into an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups;
:formula_253
(this is also called a sheaf extension.)

Let formula_254 be sheaves of abelian groups. The set formula_255 of morphisms of sheaves from formula_72 to formula_257 forms an abelian group (by the abelian group structure of formula_257). The sheaf hom of formula_72 and formula_257, denoted by,
:formula_261
is the sheaf of abelian groups formula_262 where formula_263 is the sheaf on formula_11 given by formula_265 (note sheafification is not needed here). The direct sum of formula_72 and formula_257 is the sheaf given by formula_268, and the tensor product of formula_72 and formula_257 is the sheaf associated to the presheaf formula_271.

All of these operations extend to sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings formula_272; the above is the special case when formula_272 is the constant sheaf formula_274.

=== Basic functoriality ===
Since the data of a (pre-)sheaf depends on the open subsets of the base space, sheaves on different topological spaces are unrelated to each other in the sense that there are no morphisms between them. However, given a continuous map formula_275 between two topological spaces, pushforward and pullback relate sheaves on formula_1 to those on formula_277 and vice versa.

====Direct image====
The pushforward (also known as direct image) of a sheaf formula_10 on formula_1 is the sheaf defined by
:formula_280
Here formula_28 is an open subset of formula_277, so that its preimage is open in formula_1 by the continuity of formula_84. 
This construction recovers the skyscraper sheaf formula_106 mentioned above:
:formula_286 
where formula_287 is the inclusion, and formula_105 is regarded as a sheaf on the singleton by formula_289.

For a map between locally compact spaces, the direct image with compact support is a subsheaf of the direct image. By definition, formula_290 consists of those formula_291 whose support is mapped properly. If formula_84 is proper itself, then formula_293, but in general they disagree.

====Inverse image====
The pullback or inverse image goes the other way: it produces a sheaf on formula_1, denoted formula_295 out of a sheaf formula_296 on formula_277. If formula_84 is the inclusion of an open subset, then the inverse image is just a restriction, i.e., it is given by formula_299 for an open formula_11 in formula_1. A sheaf formula_10 (on some space formula_1) is called locally constant if formula_304 by some open subsets formula_148 such that the restriction of formula_306 to all these open subsets is constant. On a wide range of topological spaces formula_1, such sheaves are equivalent to representations of the fundamental group formula_308.

For general maps formula_84, the definition of formula_295 is more involved; it is detailed at inverse image functor. The stalk is an essential special case of the pullback in view of a natural identification, where formula_248 is as above:
:formula_312
More generally, stalks satisfy formula_313.

====Extension by zero====
For the inclusion formula_314 of an open subset, the &quot;extension by zero&quot; formula_315 (pronounced &quot;j lower shriek of F&quot;) of a sheaf formula_316 of abelian groups on formula_11 is the sheafification of the presheaf defined by 
:formula_318 if formula_15 and formula_320 otherwise.
For a sheaf formula_296 on formula_1, this construction is in a sense complementary to formula_323, where formula_324 is the inclusion of the complement of formula_11:
:formula_326 for formula_104 in formula_11, and the stalk is zero otherwise, while
:formula_329 for formula_104 in formula_11, and equals formula_332 otherwise.

More generally, if formula_333 is a locally closed subset, then there exists an open formula_11 of formula_1 containing formula_272 such that formula_272 is closed in formula_11. Let formula_339 and formula_314 be the natural inclusions. Then the &quot;extension by zero&quot; of a sheaf formula_306 on formula_272 is defined by formula_343. 

Due to its nice behavior on stalks, the extension by zero functor is useful for reducing sheaf-theoretic questions on formula_1 to ones on the strata of a stratification, i.e., a decomposition of formula_1 into smaller, locally closed subsets.

== Complements ==

===Sheaves in more general categories===
In addition to (pre-)sheaves as introduced above, where formula_346 is merely a set, it is in many cases important to keep track of additional structure on these sections. For example, the sections of the sheaf of continuous functions naturally form a real vector space, and restriction is a linear map between these vector spaces.

Presheaves with values in an arbitrary category formula_347 are defined by first considering the category of open sets on formula_1 to be the posetal category formula_349 whose objects are the open sets of formula_1 and whose morphisms are inclusions. Then a formula_347-valued presheaf on formula_1 is the same as a contravariant functor from formula_349 to formula_347. Morphisms in this category of functors, also known as natural transformations, are the same as the morphisms defined above, as can be seen by unraveling the definitions.

If the target category formula_347 admits all limits, a formula_347-valued presheaf is a sheaf if the following diagram is an equalizer for every open cover
formula_357 of any open set &quot;formula_11&quot;:

:formula_359

Here the first map is the product of the restriction maps

:formula_360

and the pair of arrows the products of the two sets of restrictions

:formula_361

and

:formula_362

If formula_347 is an abelian category, this condition can also be rephrased by requiring that there is an exact sequence
:formula_364

A particular case of this sheaf condition occurs for formula_11 being the empty set, and the index set formula_366 also being empty. In this case, the sheaf condition requires formula_367 to be the terminal object in formula_347.

=== Ringed spaces and sheaves of modules ===
In several geometrical disciplines, including algebraic geometry and differential geometry, the spaces come along with a natural sheaf of rings, often called the structure sheaf and denoted by formula_177. Such a pair formula_370 is called a &quot;ringed space&quot;. Many types of spaces can be defined as certain types of ringed spaces. Commonly, all the stalks formula_371 of the structure sheaf are local rings, in which case the pair is called a &quot;locally ringed space&quot;.
For example, an formula_3-dimensional formula_116 manifold formula_79 is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf consists of formula_116-functions on the open subsets of formula_79. The property of being a &quot;locally&quot; ringed space translates into the fact that such a function, which is nonzero at a point formula_104, is also non-zero on a sufficiently small open neighborhood of formula_104. Some authors actually &quot;define&quot; real (or complex) manifolds to be locally ringed spaces that are locally isomorphic to the pair consisting of an open subset of formula_164 (respectively formula_380) together with the sheaf of formula_116 (respectively holomorphic) functions. Similarly, schemes, the foundational notion of spaces in algebraic geometry, are locally ringed spaces that are locally isomorphic to the spectrum of a ring.

Given a ringed space, a &quot;sheaf of modules&quot; is a sheaf formula_382 such that on every open set formula_11 of formula_1, formula_385 is an formula_386-module and for every inclusion of open sets formula_34, the restriction map formula_388 is compatible with the restriction map formula_389: the restriction of &quot;fs&quot; is the restriction of formula_84 times that of formula_64 for any formula_84 in formula_393 and formula_64 in formula_385.

Most important geometric objects are sheaves of modules. For example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vector bundles and locally free sheaves of formula_177-modules. This paradigm applies to real vector bundles, complex vector bundles, or vector bundles in algebraic geometry (where formula_397 consists of smooth functions, holomorphic functions, or regular functions, respectively). Sheaves of solutions to differential equations are formula_398-modules, that is, modules over the sheaf of differential operators. On any topological space, modules over the constant sheaf formula_274 are the same as sheaves of abelian groups in the sense above.

There is a different inverse image functor for sheaves of modules over sheaves of rings. This functor is usually denoted formula_400 and it is distinct from formula_401. See inverse image functor.

==== Finiteness conditions for sheaves of modules ====

Finiteness conditions for module over commutative rings give rise to similar finiteness conditions for sheaves of modules: formula_382 is called &quot;finitely generated&quot; (respectively &quot;finitely presented&quot;) if, for every point formula_104 of formula_1, there exists an open neighborhood formula_11 of formula_104, a natural number formula_3 (possibly depending on formula_11), and a surjective morphism of sheaves formula_409 (respectively, in addition a natural number formula_410, and an exact sequence formula_411.) Paralleling the notion of a coherent module, formula_382 is called a &quot;coherent sheaf&quot; if it is of finite type and if, for every open set formula_11 and every morphism of sheaves formula_414 (not necessarily surjective), the kernel of formula_415 is of finite type. formula_177 is &quot;coherent&quot; if it is coherent as a module over itself. Like for modules, coherence is in general a strictly stronger condition than finite presentation. The Oka coherence theorem states that the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold is coherent.

=== The étalé space of a sheaf ===

In the examples above it was noted that some sheaves occur naturally as sheaves of sections. In fact, all sheaves of sets can be represented as sheaves of sections of a topological space called the &quot;étalé space&quot;, from the French word étalé , meaning roughly &quot;spread out&quot;. If formula_417 is a sheaf over formula_1, then the étalé space (sometimes called the étale space) of formula_72 is a topological space formula_229 together with a local homeomorphism formula_421 such that the sheaf of sections formula_422 of formula_423 is formula_72. The space &quot;formula_229&quot; is usually very strange, and even if the sheaf &quot;formula_72&quot; arises from a natural topological situation, &quot;formula_229&quot; may not have any clear topological interpretation. For example, if &quot;formula_72&quot; is the sheaf of sections of a continuous function formula_429, then formula_430 if and only if formula_84 is a local homeomorphism.

The étalé space &quot;formula_229&quot; is constructed from the stalks of &quot;formula_72&quot; over &quot;formula_1&quot;. As a set, it is their disjoint union and &quot;formula_423&quot; is the obvious map that takes the value formula_104 on the stalk of formula_72 over formula_438. The topology of &quot;formula_229&quot; is defined as follows. For each element formula_440 and each formula_441, we get a germ of formula_64 at formula_104, denoted formula_444 or formula_218. These germs determine points of &quot;formula_229&quot;. For any formula_11 and formula_440, the union of these points (for all formula_441) is declared to be open in &quot;formula_229&quot;. Notice that each stalk has the discrete topology as subspace topology. Two morphisms between sheaves determine a continuous map of the corresponding étalé spaces that is compatible with the projection maps (in the sense that every germ is mapped to a germ over the same point). This makes the construction into a functor.

The construction above determines an equivalence of categories between the category of sheaves of sets on &quot;formula_1&quot; and the category of étalé spaces over &quot;formula_1&quot;. The construction of an étalé space can also be applied to a presheaf, in which case the sheaf of sections of the étalé space recovers the sheaf associated to the given presheaf.

This construction makes all sheaves into representable functors on certain categories of topological spaces. As above, let &quot;formula_72&quot; be a sheaf on &quot;formula_1&quot;, let &quot;formula_229&quot; be its étalé space, and let formula_456 be the natural projection. Consider the overcategory formula_457 of topological spaces over formula_1, that is, the category of topological spaces together with fixed continuous maps to formula_1. Every object of this category is a continuous map formula_93, and a morphism from formula_461 to formula_462 is a continuous map formula_463 that commutes with the two maps to formula_1. There is a functorformula_465sending an object formula_93 to formula_467. For example, if formula_468 is the inclusion of an open subset, thenformula_469and for the inclusion of a point formula_470, thenformula_471is the stalk of formula_72 at formula_104. There is a natural isomorphismformula_474,which shows that formula_421 (for the étalé space) represents the functor formula_476.

&quot;formula_229&quot; is constructed so that the projection map &quot;formula_423&quot; is a covering map. In algebraic geometry, the natural analog of a covering map is called an étale morphism. Despite its similarity to &quot;étalé&quot;, the word étale has a different meaning in French. It is possible to turn formula_229 into a scheme and &quot;formula_423&quot; into a morphism of schemes in such a way that &quot;formula_423&quot; retains the same universal property, but &quot;formula_423&quot; is &quot;not&quot; in general an étale morphism because it is not quasi-finite. It is, however, formally étale.

The definition of sheaves by étalé spaces is older than the definition given earlier in the article. It is still common in some areas of mathematics such as mathematical analysis.

== Sheaf cohomology ==
In contexts where the open set formula_11 is fixed, and the sheaf is regarded as a variable, the set formula_146 is also often denoted formula_485
As was noted above, this functor does not preserve epimorphisms. Instead, an epimorphism of sheaves formula_486 is a map with the following property: for any section formula_487 there is a covering formula_357 where formula_489 of open subsets, such that the restriction formula_490 are in the image of formula_491. However, formula_492 itself need not be in the image of formula_346. A concrete example of this phenomenon is the exponential map 
:formula_494
between the sheaf of holomorphic functions and non-zero holomorphic functions. This map is an epimorphism, which amounts to saying that any non-zero holomorphic function formula_492 (on some open subset in formula_223, say), admits a complex logarithm &quot;locally&quot;, i.e., after restricting formula_492 to appropriate open subsets. However, formula_492 need not have a logarithm globally.

Sheaf cohomology captures this phenomenon. More precisely, for an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups
:formula_499
(i.e., an epimorphism formula_500 whose kernel is formula_501), there is a long exact sequenceformula_502By means of this sequence, the first cohomology group formula_503 is a measure for the non-surjectivity of the map between sections of formula_504 and formula_505.

There are several different ways of constructing sheaf cohomology. introduced them by defining sheaf cohomology as the derived functor of formula_476. This method is theoretically satisfactory, but, being based on injective resolutions, of little use in concrete computations. Godement resolutions are another general, but practically inaccessible approach.

=== Computing sheaf cohomology ===
Especially in the context of sheaves on manifolds, sheaf cohomology can often be computed using resolutions by soft sheaves, fine sheaves, and flabby sheaves (also known as flasque sheaves from the French &quot;flasque&quot; meaning flabby). For example, a partition of unity argument shows that the sheaf of smooth functions on a manifold is soft. The higher cohomology groups formula_507 for formula_508 vanish for soft sheaves, which gives a way of computing cohomology of other sheaves. For example, the de Rham complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf formula_509 on any smooth manifold, so the sheaf cohomology of formula_509 is equal to its de Rham cohomology.

A different approach is by Čech cohomology. Čech cohomology was the first cohomology theory developed for sheaves and it is well-suited to concrete calculations, such as computing the coherent sheaf cohomology of complex projective space formula_511. It relates sections on open subsets of the space to cohomology classes on the space. In most cases, Čech cohomology computes the same cohomology groups as the derived functor cohomology. However, for some pathological spaces, Čech cohomology will give the correct formula_512 but incorrect higher cohomology groups. To get around this, Jean-Louis Verdier developed hypercoverings. Hypercoverings not only give the correct higher cohomology groups but also allow the open subsets mentioned above to be replaced by certain morphisms from another space. This flexibility is necessary in some applications, such as the construction of Pierre Deligne&#x27;s mixed Hodge structures.

Many other coherent sheaf cohomology groups are found using an embedding formula_513 of a space formula_1 into a space with known cohomology, such as formula_511, or some weighted projective space. In this way, the known sheaf cohomology groups on these ambient spaces can be related to the sheaves formula_516, giving formula_517. For example, computing the coherent sheaf cohomology of projective plane curves is easily found. One big theorem in this space is the Hodge decomposition found using a spectral sequence associated to sheaf cohomology groups, proved by Deligne. Essentially, the formula_518-page with termsformula_519the sheaf cohomology of a smooth projective variety formula_1, degenerates, meaning formula_521. This gives the canonical Hodge structure on the cohomology groups formula_522. It was later found these cohomology groups can be easily explicitly computed using Griffiths residues. See Jacobian ideal. These kinds of theorems lead to one of the deepest theorems about the cohomology of algebraic varieties, the decomposition theorem, paving the path for Mixed Hodge modules.

Another clean approach to the computation of some cohomology groups is the Borel–Bott–Weil theorem, which identifies the cohomology groups of some line bundles on flag manifolds with irreducible representations of Lie groups. This theorem can be used, for example, to easily compute the cohomology groups of all line bundles on projective space and grassmann manifolds.

In many cases there is a duality theory for sheaves that generalizes Poincaré duality. See Grothendieck duality and Verdier duality.

=== Derived categories of sheaves ===

The derived category of the category of sheaves of, say, abelian groups on some space &quot;X&quot;, denoted here as formula_523, is the conceptual haven for sheaf cohomology, by virtue of the following relation: 
:formula_524
The adjunction between formula_401, which is the left adjoint of formula_526 (already on the level of sheaves of abelian groups) gives rise to an adjunction 
:formula_527 (for formula_528),
where formula_529 is the derived functor. This latter functor encompasses the notion of sheaf cohomology since formula_530 for formula_531.
Like formula_526, the direct image with compact support formula_533 can also be derived. By virtue of the following isomorphism formula_534 parametrizes the cohomology with compact support of the fibers of formula_84:
:formula_536
This isomorphism is an example of a base change theorem. There is another adjunction
:formula_537
Unlike all the functors considered above, the twisted (or exceptional) inverse image functor formula_538 is in general only defined on the level of derived categories, i.e., the functor is not obtained as the derived functor of some functor between abelian categories. If formula_531 and &quot;X&quot; is a smooth orientable manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;, then
:formula_540
This computation, and the compatibility of the functors with duality (see Verdier duality) can be used to obtain a high-brow explanation of Poincaré duality. In the context of quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes, there is a similar duality known as coherent duality.

Perverse sheaves are certain objects in formula_523, i.e., complexes of sheaves (but not in general sheaves proper). They are an important tool to study the geometry of singularities.

==== Derived categories of coherent sheaves and the Grothendieck group ====
Another important application of derived categories of sheaves is with the derived category of coherent sheaves on a scheme formula_1 denoted formula_543. This was used by Grothendieck in his development of intersection theory using derived categories and K-theory, that the intersection product of subschemes formula_544 is represented in K-theory asformula_545where formula_546 are coherent sheaves defined by the formula_177-modules given by their structure sheaves.

== Sites and topoi ==
André Weil&#x27;s Weil conjectures stated that there was a cohomology theory for algebraic varieties over finite fields that would give an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. The cohomology of a complex manifold can be defined as the sheaf cohomology of the locally constant sheaf formula_548 in the Euclidean topology, which suggests defining a Weil cohomology theory in positive characteristic as the sheaf cohomology of a constant sheaf. But the only classical topology on such a variety is the Zariski topology, and the Zariski topology has very few open sets, so few that the cohomology of any Zariski-constant sheaf on an irreducible variety vanishes (except in degree zero). Alexandre Grothendieck solved this problem by introducing Grothendieck topologies, which axiomatize the notion of &quot;covering&quot;. Grothendieck&#x27;s insight was that the definition of a sheaf depends only on the open sets of a topological space, not on the individual points. Once he had axiomatized the notion of covering, open sets could be replaced by other objects. A presheaf takes each one of these objects to data, just as before, and a sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the gluing axiom with respect to our new notion of covering. This allowed Grothendieck to define étale cohomology and ℓ-adic cohomology, which eventually were used to prove the Weil conjectures.

A category with a Grothendieck topology is called a &quot;site&quot;. A category of sheaves on a site is called a &quot;topos&quot; or a &quot;Grothendieck topos&quot;. The notion of a topos was later abstracted by William Lawvere and Miles Tierney to define an elementary topos, which has connections to mathematical logic.

== History ==

The first origins of sheaf theory are hard to pin down – they may be co-extensive with the idea of analytic continuation. It took about 15 years for a recognisable, free-standing theory of sheaves to emerge from the foundational work on cohomology.
* 1936 Eduard Čech introduces the &quot;nerve&quot; construction, for associating a simplicial complex to an open covering.
* 1938 Hassler Whitney gives a &#x27;modern&#x27; definition of cohomology, summarizing the work since J. W. Alexander and Kolmogorov first defined &quot;cochains&quot;.
* 1943 Norman Steenrod publishes on homology &quot;with local coefficients&quot;.
* 1945 Jean Leray publishes work carried out as a prisoner of war, motivated by proving fixed-point theorems for application to PDE theory; it is the start of sheaf theory and spectral sequences.
* 1947 Henri Cartan reproves the de Rham theorem by sheaf methods, in correspondence with André Weil (see De Rham–Weil theorem). Leray gives a sheaf definition in his courses via closed sets (the later &quot;carapaces&quot;).
* 1948 The Cartan seminar writes up sheaf theory for the first time.
* 1950 The &quot;second edition&quot; sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar: the sheaf space (&quot;espace étalé&quot;) definition is used, with stalkwise structure. Supports are introduced, and cohomology with supports. Continuous mappings give rise to spectral sequences. At the same time Kiyoshi Oka introduces an idea (adjacent to that) of a sheaf of ideals, in several complex variables.
* 1951 The Cartan seminar proves theorems A and B, based on Oka&#x27;s work.
* 1953 The finiteness theorem for coherent sheaves in the analytic theory is proved by Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, as is Serre duality.
* 1954 Serre&#x27;s paper &quot;Faisceaux algébriques cohérents&quot; (published in 1955) introduces sheaves into algebraic geometry. These ideas are immediately exploited by Friedrich Hirzebruch, who writes a major 1956 book on topological methods.
* 1955 Alexander Grothendieck in lectures in Kansas defines abelian category and &quot;presheaf&quot;, and by using injective resolutions allows direct use of sheaf cohomology on all topological spaces, as derived functors.
* 1956 Oscar Zariski&#x27;s report &quot;Algebraic sheaf theory&quot;
* 1957 Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;Tohoku&quot; paper rewrites homological algebra; he proves Grothendieck duality (i.e., Serre duality for possibly singular algebraic varieties).
* 1957 onwards: Grothendieck extends sheaf theory in line with the needs of algebraic geometry, introducing: schemes and general sheaves on them, local cohomology, derived categories (with Verdier), and Grothendieck topologies. There emerges also his influential schematic idea of &#x27;six operations&#x27; in homological algebra.
* 1958 Roger Godement&#x27;s book on sheaf theory is published. At around this time Mikio Sato proposes his hyperfunctions, which will turn out to have sheaf-theoretic nature.

At this point sheaves had become a mainstream part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to algebraic topology. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is intuitionistic logic (this observation is now often referred to as Kripke–Joyal semantics, but probably should be attributed to a number of authors).

<text>A child prodigy is, technically, a child under the age of 10 who produces meaningful work in some domain at the level of an adult expert. The term is also applied more broadly to describe young people who are extraordinarily talented in some field.

The term wunderkind (from German &quot;Wunderkind&quot;; literally &quot;wonder child&quot;) is sometimes used as a synonym for child prodigy, particularly in media accounts. &quot;Wunderkind&quot; also is used to recognise those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers.

Generally, prodigies in all domains are suggested to have relatively elevated IQ, extraordinary memory, and exceptional attention to detail. Significantly, while math and physics prodigies may have higher IQs, this may be an impediment to art prodigies.

==Examples==
=== Chess prodigies ===
==== Deliberate practice ====
K. Anders Ericsson emphasised the contribution of deliberate practice over their innate talent to prodigies&#x27; exceptional performance in chess. The deliberate practice is energy-consuming and requires attention to correct mistakes. As prodigies start formal chess training early with intense dedication to deliberate practice, they may accumulate enough deliberate practice for their exceptional performance. Therefore, this framework provide an arguably reasonable justification for chess prodigies. However, similar amounts of practice also make children differ in their achievements because of other factors such as the quality of deliberate practice, and their interests in chess.

==== Intelligence and chess performance ====
Chess prodigies may have higher IQs than normal children. This positive link between chess skills of prodigies and intelligence is particularly significant on the “performance intelligence”, regarding fluid reasoning, spatial processing, attentiveness to details, and visual-motor integration, while least significant on the “verbal intelligence”, regarding the ability to understand and reason using concepts framed in words. However, this positive link is absent among adult experts. Remarkably, in the sample of chess prodigies, the more intelligent children played chess worse. This is considered as the result of less practice time of more intelligent chess skills.

==== Practice-plasticity-processes model ====
Practice-plasticity-processes (PPP) model was proposed to explain the existence of chess prodigies by integrating the practice extreme and innate talent extreme theories. Besides deliberate practice, neuroplasticity is identified as another critical component for developing chess heuristics (e.g., simple search techniques and abstract rules like “occupy the centre”), chunks (e.g., group of pieces locating in specific squares), and templates (e.g., familiarised complex patterns of chunks), which are essential for chess skills. The more plastic the brain is, the easier it is for them to acquire chunks, templates, and heuristics for better performance. On the other hand, inherited individual differences in the brain are circumscribed children to learn these skills. 

=== Music prodigies ===

Music prodigies usually express their talents in exceptional performance or composition.

The Multifactorial Gene-Environment Interaction Model incorporates the roles of adequate practice, certain personality traits, elevated IQ, and exceptional working memory in the explanation of music prodigies. A study comparing current and former prodigies with normal people and musicians who showed their talents or were trained later in life to test this model. It found prodigies neither have exceptional performance in terms of IQ, working memory, nor specific personality. This study also emphasises the significance of frequent practice early in life, when the brain is more plastic. Besides the quality of practice, and the parental investment, the experience of flow during the practice is important for efficient and adequate practice for music prodigies. Practice demands high levels of concentration, which is hard for children in general, but flow can provide inherent pleasures of the practice to ensure this focused work.

==Memory capacity of prodigies==
PET scans performed on several mathematics prodigies have suggested that they think in terms of long-term working memory (LTWM). This memory, specific to a field of expertise, is capable of holding relevant information for extended periods, usually hours. For example, experienced waiters have been found to hold the orders of up to twenty customers in their heads while they serve them, but perform only as well as an average person in number-sequence recognition. The PET scans also answer questions about which specific areas of the brain associate themselves with manipulating numbers.

One subject never excelled as a child in mathematics, but he taught himself algorithms and tricks for calculatory speed, becoming capable of extremely complex mental math. His brain, compared to six other controls, was studied using the PET scan, revealing separate areas of his brain that he manipulated to solve complex problems. Some of the areas that he and presumably prodigies use are brain sectors dealing in visual and spatial memory, as well as visual mental imagery. Other areas of the brain showed use by the subject, including a sector of the brain generally related to childlike &quot;finger counting&quot;, probably used in his mind to relate numbers to the visual cortex.

This finding is consistent with the introspective report of this calculating prodigy, which states that he used visual images to encode and retrieve numerical information in LTWM. Compared to short-term memory strategies, used by normal people on complex mathematical problems, encoding and retrieval episodic memory strategies would be more efficient. The prodigy may switch between these two strategies, which reduce the storage retrieval times of long-term memory and circumvent the limited capacities of short-term memory. In turn, they can encode and retrieve specific information (e.g., the intermediate answers during the calculation) in the long-term working memory more accurately and effectively.

Similar strategies were found among prodigies mastering mental abacus calculation. The positions of beads on the physical abacus act as visual proxies of each digit for prodigies to solve complex computations. This one-to-one corresponding structure allows them to rapidly encode and retrieve digits in the long-term working memory during the calculation. The fMRI scans showed stronger activation of brain areas related to visual processing for Chinese children being trained with abacus mental compared to control groups. This may indicate a greater demand for visuospatial information processing and visual-motor imagination in abacus mental calculation. Additionally, the right middle frontal gyrus activation is suggested to be the neuroanatomical link between prodigies’ abacus mental calculation and the visuospatial working memory.  This activation serves a mediation effect on the correlation between abacus-based mental calculation and visuospatial working memory. A training-induced neuroplasticity regarding working memory performance for children is proposed. A study examining German calculating prodigies also proposed a similar reason for exceptional calculation abilities. Excellent working memory capacities and neuroplastic changes brought by extensive practice would be essential to enhance this domain-specific skill.

==Working memory/cerebellum theory==

Noting that the cerebellum acts to streamline the speed and efficiency of all thought processes, Vandervert explained the abilities of prodigies in terms of the collaboration of working memory and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. Citing extensive imaging evidence, Vandervert first proposed this approach in two publications which appeared in 2003. In addition to imaging evidence, Vandervert&#x27;s approach is supported by the substantial award-winning studies of the cerebellum by Masao Ito.

Vandervert provided extensive argument that, in the prodigy, the transition from visual-spatial working memory to other forms of thought (language, art, mathematics) is accelerated by the unique emotional disposition of the prodigy and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. According to Vandervert, in the emotion-driven prodigy (commonly observed as a &quot;rage to master&quot;) the cerebellum accelerates the streamlining of the efficiencies of working memory in its manipulation and decomposition/re-composition of visual-spatial content into language acquisition and into linguistic, mathematical, and artistic precocity.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a child is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related and other notational system-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then &quot;blended&quot; in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. In child prodigies, Vandervert believes this blending process is &quot;accelerated&quot; due to their unique emotional sensitivities which result in high levels of repetitious focus on, in most cases, particular &quot;rule-governed&quot; knowledge domains. He has also argued that child prodigies first began to appear about 10,000 years ago when rule-governed knowledge had accumulated to a significant point, perhaps at the agricultural-religious settlements of Göbekli Tepe or Cyprus.

==Development==
=== Nature versus nurture ===
Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. For example, László Polgár set out to raise his children to be chess players, and all three of his daughters went on to become world-class players (two of whom are grandmasters), emphasising the potency a child&#x27;s environment can have in determining the pursuits toward which a child&#x27;s energy will be directed, and showing that an incredible amount of skill can be developed through suitable training.

=== Co-incidence theory ===
Co-incidence theory explains the development of prodigies with a continuum of the discussion of nature and nurture. This theory states that the integrative of various factors in the development and expression of human potential, including:

* Biological qualities (e.g., physical distinctions and limitations which entail talents, such as the absolute pitch of music prodigies)
* Individual psychological qualities (e.g., perseverance, patience, attention to detail)
* Intermediate context (e.g., family structure and its traditions)
* Cultural effect (e.g., an increasing number of chess prodigies may be due to the professionalization of chess, or the emergence of computers as a study tool)
* Historical and political context (e.g., girls in certain religious backgrounds may not receive training in music or any other art)
* Domain and the surrounding field (e.g., whether children with exceptional skills were born in an environment with flourishment in this field)

=== Late development ===
Prodigiousness in childhood is not always maintained into adulthood. Some researchers have found that gifted children fall behind due to lack of effort. Jim Taylor, professor at the University of San Francisco, theorizes that this is because gifted children experience success at an early age with little to no effort and may not develop a sense of ownership of success. Therefore, these children might not develop a connection between effort and outcome. Some children might also believe that they can succeed without effort in the future as well. Dr. Anders Ericcson, professor at Florida State University, researches expert performance in sports, music, mathematics, and other activities. His findings demonstrate that prodigiousness in childhood is not a strong indicator of later success. Rather, the number of hours devoted to the activity was a better indicator.
Rosemary Callard-Szulgit and other educators have written extensively about the problem of perfectionism in bright children, calling it their &quot;number one social-emotional trait&quot;. Gifted children often associate even slight imperfection with failure, so that they become fearful of effort, even in their personal lives, and in extreme cases end up virtually immobilized.

== Link with autism ==
Prodigies have been found with the over-representation of relatives with autism on their family pedigrees. Autism traits on the Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) were reported in both first-degree relatives of child prodigies and of autism, which was higher than normal prevalence.

Some autistic traits can be found among prodigies. Firstly, the social function of arithmetic prodigies may be weaker because of larger activation in certain brain areas enhancing their arithmetic performance, which is also essential for social and emotional functions (i.e., precuneus, lingual and fusiform gyrus). These neuroplastic changes in neural networks may modulate their social performances in terms of emotional face processing and emotional evaluation of complex social interactions. Nevertheless, this emotional or social modulation must not score at psychopathological levels. Additionally, the attentiveness to details, a typical characteristic of AQ, is enhanced among prodigies compared to normal people, even those with Asperger syndrome.

<text>Blackbear Bosin (June 5, 1921 – August 9, 1980) was a self-taught Kiowa/Comanche sculptor, painter, and commercial artist. He is also known by his Kiowa name, Tsate Kongia, which means &quot;black bear.&quot;

Bosin gained notoriety for his surreal and dynamic variations on the traditional Flatstyle painting of the Southern Plains Indians, and he add depth, motion, and drama to the genre while emphasizing symbolism.

His works have been modern icons of Native American art, and of his community (Wichita), county (Sedgwick County), state (Kansas) and region.

==Early life (1921–1946)==

Francis Blackbear Bosin was born June 5, 1921, in Cyril, Oklahoma, near Anadarko, reportedly in a tipi. His father, Frank Blackbear, was Kiowa, and his mother, Ada Tivis Bosin, was of the Quahadi (Antelope Eater) band, of the Comanche Nation. His Kiowa name, Tsate Kongia, means &quot;Blackbear&quot; and belongs to his paternal grandfather, a Kiowa chief. As the oldest male child, he was sent to live with his maternal, Comanche grandparents as soon as he could walk. He attended St. Patrick&#x27;s Mission School in Anadarko where he was exposed to the paintings of the Kiowa Six.

Bosin briefly studied Anadarko High School before leaving to attend Cyril High School. At 17, Bosin married Ruth Johnson (Caddo), and the couple had two daughters, Rowena and Patricia. The University of Oklahoma offered him an arts scholarship after graduating high school, but due to his new responsibilities as a husband and a father, he turned it down. Instead, he chose to attend the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School where he trained to work with sheet metal. In 1940, Bosin and Johnson moved to Wichita, Kansas, with their daughters. It was here that the couple had two sons, Francis Jr. and Niles. Bosin found work at Beech Aircraft.

To support his family, Bosin enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and was trained as a machine gunner. In November 1943, while stationed in Maui, Hawaii, he fell ill and had to be hospitalized at Aiea Heights Naval Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. Here he took up painting again. Before his discharge in 1945, the hospital hosted a one-man exhibition of his works (later mistakenly reported a one-man exhibition of the Honolulu Academy of Arts.) Before leaving the military, Bosin briefly returned to Wichita to sign divorce papers, which marked the end of his marriage with Johnson. Bosin permanently returned to Wichita in 1946, where he worked as a color separator and plate maker for Western Lithograph and then as an industrial designer and production illustrator for Boeing-Wichita.

== Art career (1946–1967) ==
After returning to Wichita in 1946, Bosin continued to paint. In the same year, he entered the Philbrook Art Center&#x27;s first Indian Artists Annual, where he won an honorable mention for &quot;Green Corn Dance.&quot; After his success at the Philbrook, Bosin continued to enter art competitions there and at other galleries, art centers, and museums. Between 1947 and 1948, his work was included in exhibitions at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts and the Detroit Institute of Arts. In 1951, Bosin entered an Indian art competition held by the Denver Museum of Art, where he was awarded the Purchase Prize.

Bosin&#x27;s career as an artist began to take off in the early 1950s, beginning in 1950 with a special showing of 66 of his paintings, at the National Museum of Natural History, of the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C. At the Philbrook&#x27;s &quot;Indian Art Annual&quot; in 1952 he was awarded first prize for &quot;Death Bird.&quot;

While working at Boeing, Bosin met Nola Simmonds, an art teacher who would later become his wife. The two were married in 1953, after which they moved in together and Bosin became stepfather to David, Simmonds only child. Bosin&#x27;s daughters lived with the family in Wichita until they both graduated high school, and one of his sons, Francis Jr., lived with them up until the sixth grade.

Also in 1953, Bosin again secured first place at the Philbrook with &quot;Prairie Fire&quot;, the piece that eventually brought him international recognition. The acclaimed painting was purchased by the Philbrook and later featured as a centerfold, with detailed description, in the May 1955 issue of &quot;National Geographic.&quot; The work, with its vivid depiction of action—Indians on galloping horses, and animals desperately fleeing an oncoming fire—was regarded as a turning point in the field of normally static Plains Indians art. For a time, it was displayed in the White House.

In 1955, his works were exhibited at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 1955, &quot;Wind Spirit&quot;, the companion piece to &quot;Prairie Fire,&quot; was shown at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco, and then won the Purchase Prize at the Philbrook&#x27;s Indian Annual. After the competition, the Philbrook invited Bosin to participate in a one-man exhibition.

Bosin opened the Great Plains Studio in 1959 to expand his studio space and display his art alongside the works of other Indigenous artists. The same year, he was commissioned by the Hotel Broadview in downtown Wichita to design a mosaic mural for the Crystal Ballroom. Constructed entirely from semi-opaque glass chips and measuring an incredible 1,500 square feet, &quot;The Advance of Civilization in Kansas&quot; is the largest continuous mural in Kansas.

His paintings continued to be awarded by art institutions. In 1960, Bosin entered the All-Indian Show in New York, where he won both the First and Grand Prize. The following year he traveled to Kreuzlingen, Switzerland, to receive honors after he was elected Fellow of the International Institute of Arts and Letters (IIAL). In the same year, two of his former entries in the Philbrook&#x27;s Indian Artist Annual were purchased by the Arts and Crafts Board of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1963, the Philbrook hosted another one-man show of Bosin&#x27;s work and four of his pieces were included in the Heard Museum&#x27;s Gallery of Indian Art&#x27;s inaugural exhibition.

Two years later, in 1965, Bosin proceeded to win first place and the Grand Prize at the Philbrook&#x27;s Indian Artists Annual. The same year, the Wichita Art Museum hosted a showing of 24 of Bosin&#x27;s works. The museum later commissioned him to do a painting titled, &quot;Wichita, My Son,&quot; which represents the relationship between Wichita and the local Indigenous communities. Bosin also participated in an exhibition at the Whitney Gallery of Western Art at the Buffalo Bill Cody complex in Cody, Wyoming.

Bosin was the only Native American artist to participate in the 1965 White House Festival of the Arts, when &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; was displayed at both the White House and the National Gallery of Art. The beaded bowtie and cummerbund he wore were made by his mother and attracted the attention of the First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, who requested that Bosin be moved to sit at her table.

The U.S. Department of the Interior commissioned a series of paintings from Bosin, known as the &quot;Kiowa Series&quot;, devoted to displaying the historical and religious heritage of the Kiowa. The series consisted of three works, &quot;Of the Owls Telling&quot; (), &quot;Taime Man,&quot; and &quot;The Ten Grandmothers.&quot; Bosin completed the first two paintings between 1965 and 1966, but the final work was not finished until 1973 and the series was not publicly displayed until 1976. He was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board of the Department of the Interior in 1966.

In 1967, Bosin was awarded the Victory Trophy at the 22nd Indian Annual hosted by the Philbrook. After receiving this award, he decided to step back from entering art competitions altogether because he believed it was time for younger artists to gain recognition. He was also chosen as an exhibitor, that year, for the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s American Discovers Indian Art Show.

== Later years and death (1967–1980) ==
===&quot;Keeper of the Plains&quot;===
Bosin had been experiencing health issues, starting in 1960 when he was diagnosed with diabetes, but his health worsened significantly in 1968. He had to be hospitalized for a period and his doctors advised that he slow down his work. A year later, Bosin suffered his first heart attack.

While in the hospital, Elmer Hall, a friend of Bosin and employee of the KG&amp;E plant in Wichita, asked Bosin if he would design a large-scale statue as tribute to the Indigenous peoples in the area. The statue — a 44-foot, 5-ton, Cor-Ten steel sculpture — is a giant, stylized representation of a Native American in historic dress, gesturing to the Great Spirit in the sky, and titled &quot;The Keeper of the Plains.&quot;

It is situated near the city&#x27;s center, immediately northwest of downtown Wichita, adjacent to the grounds of the Mid-America All-Indian Center, 
at the confluence of the Big Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers,—a site sacred to Native Americans, and the former home of the Wichita tribe.

Construction of the sculpture began in 1970 and, after multiple financial setbacks, was finally completed in 1974, ostensibly as a commemorative project in preparation for the 1976 United States Bicentennial. A ceremony with performances and blessings by local Indigenous peoples, including a blessing in the Winnebago language by Etta Hunter, and speech by U.S. Senator Bob Dole, was held for the official unveiling of the giant sculpture.

In subsequent years, the statue has come be the unofficial (in some cases, official) symbol of Wichita, — widely reproduced and represented — and is the core element in the official seal of the surrounding county, Sedgwick County, Kansas.

The &quot;Keeper&quot; has become the focal point of a $20 million river-beautification project, with ornate, symbolic footbridges built to the site, and a park, walkways, gardens and fire pits installed around the statue, which has been mounted on a 30-foot-high rock pedestal jutting out into the river. The statue is the centerpiece of some public events, including Native American events and commemorations of the statue, itself.

In 1975, two 10-foot replicas of the sculpture were installed in Wichita&#x27;s sister cities: Tlalnepantla, Mexico, and Orleans, France. Starting in 2017, a local business organization began commissioning dozens of 10-foot glass-fiber replicas of the statue, for installation throughout the city—each one decorated individually by local artists, usually with a locally relevant symbolic theme.

===Later art career===
In 1970, Bosin exhibited at the All-Indian Show, at the Kennedy Center, in New York City.

In the early months of 1971, Bosin held a show at the Wichita Art Association and was commissioned by the Farm Credit Bank of Wichita to paint a large-scale mural, &quot;From Whence All Life,&quot; with its signature central figure of the Great Spirit.

Months later in September, Bosin had to undergo open heart surgery, which severely set back the progress of the mural. His recovery was lengthy, and he suffered loss of sight in both eyes that left wide, horizontal fields of darkness across his vision. The quality of Bosin&#x27;s painting did not decline because of his vision loss, but it did make the work more difficult for him. To complete the mural on time, his wife and office staff helped paint the basic areas of the work while he filled in the details. The mural was unveiled in 1972.

Bosin was commissioned to create ten designs for a series of fifty sterling silver medals produced by the Franklin Mint for &quot;The Medallic History of the American Indian&quot; in 1975&quot;.&quot; The double-sided coins recorded historical events ranging from prehistoric migration from Asia to North America to the completion of the transcontinental railroad, featuring the &quot;traditional view&quot; of the event on one side and the &quot;Indian interpretation&quot; on the other.

In 1976, Bosin was honored at the American Indian National Achievement Awards in the Traditional Indian Painting category. He was also included in &quot;Songs from the Earth,&quot; an important exhibition of Indigenous art, and appointed to the Kansas Arts Commission Board.

The state of Kansas awarded Bosin the Distinguished Service Award in 1977. He was later appointed as Governor&#x27;s Artist by Robert F. Bennett, Kansas&#x27;s governor at the time.

Bosin began restricting the showing of his work in 1978, but he did show in the Oklahoma Museum of Art and the New Britain Museum of American Art during that year. Due to the toll his loss of vision took on his ability to paint quickly, Bosin had to give up gouache in favor of acrylics. While the acrylics dried less quickly than gouache, they did not have the same layered effect as Bosin&#x27;s earlier works. He produced his final painting, &quot;Reflections of Rainy Mountains&quot;, using acrylics.

===Final years===
In the later years of his life, Bosin began to dance at regional powwows with his close friends. He wore traditional regalia that was adorned with his mother&#x27;s intricate beadwork. Bosin led a dance to the rhythm of a song that was passed on to him by his father when he had been inducted into the Kiowa Gourd Society and O-Ho-Mahs Lodge Society years before.

In March 1980, Bosin&#x27;s mother died while living with him and his wife. Stricken by grief, Bosin struggled to complete his final commissions.

Five months later, on August 9, 1980, Bosin died from heart problems and complications stemming from a severe gall bladder infection. He was survived by his second wife, Nola Davidson Simmonds, his four children, Rowena, Patricia, Francis Jr., and Niles, and stepson, David Simmonds.

In 2012, David Simmonds published a biography detailing Bosin&#x27;s life and accomplishments, titled &quot;Blackbear Bosin: Keeper of the Indian Spirit.&quot;

== Art style and practice ==
===Painting and sketching===
Bosin began practicing art while attending St. Patrick&#x27;s Mission School in Anadarko, where he was able to study Kiowa and European art through the school&#x27;s collections. It was through his observations of historical art forms that he learned how to manipulate bodily proportions, create anatomically correct figures, and emulate the style of the Kiowa Six. He was also heavily influenced by his mother, who was an accomplished bead worker.

A self-taught artist, Bosin attributed his distinctive artistic style to his lack of formal arts training and relative isolation from other practicing artists. His work became increasingly complex and dynamic, reflecting the influence of surrealists and his incorporation of culturally specific scenes and subject matter. He wove a unique aesthetic combining the Southern Plains Indians&#x27; flat style of painting with modern surrealism, delivered through Bosin&#x27;s favorite medium, gouache, a type of opaque watercolor paint. Watercolors and gouache allowed Bosin to create a controlled layering effect that gave his canvasses their distinctive look.

Bosin was known to make several drafts of each painting, sometimes making up to ten sketches before transferring the image onto the canvas, to ensure that the composition was correct. Bosin also began to include increasingly detailed backgrounds in his paintings that set the tone of the piece and constructed a sense of space.

Although he could paint in European-style realism, Bosin found no reason to do so. In a 1975 interview, he stated: &quot;I find it empty. I simply don&#x27;t care for it. I would rather stay within the limitations of Traditional Indian paintings,&quot; going on to explain that adapting and reshaping traditional styles better represents the transient, poetic experience he is trying to capture in his work.

Bosin also frequently sketched, filling his sketchbooks with caricatures, drawings, and cartoons, all of which he signed as &quot;Chief.&quot; The first and only time his cartoons were exhibited was in 1979 at the New Britain Museum of American Art in Connecticut.

=== Commercial art ===
Bosin also worked as a production illustrator and commercial artist. In 1952 when he left Boeing to work in the training aids and arts department at McConnell Air Force Base, Bosin produced visual training materials for pilots. His instructional booklet, &quot;JetRock Jock,&quot; took a humorous approach to advising pilots of the various mishaps and dangers of flying. The booklet gained popularity and was distributed to other pilot training programs across the United States.

In 1955, Bosin left the civil service sector to pursue art fulltime. He partnered with A.E. &quot;Waddy&quot; Wadsworth to open a small commercial art studio where they produced visuals for local movie theaters and small businesses.

Bosin also designed the logos for the Mid-America All-Indian Center in Wichita, and the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant, of Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co. (KG&amp;E, absorbed into Westar, later into Evergy) in Burlington, Kansas.

<text>Job rotation is the lateral transfer of employees between jobs in an organization without a change in their hierarchical rank or salary grade. Rotated employees usually do not remain in these jobs permanently and may also not return to former jobs. The frequency and duration of intervals in a job rotation can vary widely from daily to periods of years. The practice serves several functions including staffing, employee motivation, managing employee fatigue, employee orientation and placement, and career development.

Job rotation is used systematically by a large number of companies. This can be through structured job rotation programmes, or informally though the frequent lateral transfers that occur in organizations. Rotations are more common among lower performing staff who don’t generally achieve sizeable performance gains after a rotation. The rotation of higher performing staff is less prevalent, but has been shown to be beneficial for them with sizeable performance increases within two years of a job rotation. Most companies using job rotation have less strict attendance policies due to increased employee engagement and flexibility, while most organizations that implement job rotation focus on productivity and skill development, which can lead to more adaptive workplace policies. Rotation differs from promotion, which refers to an upward movement or rise in rank in an organizational hierarchy, usually indicated by an increase in responsibility and status and change in compensation.

Job rotation contradicts the principles of specialization and the division of labor, which suggest employees specialize in narrowly defined tasks as a way to increase productivity. It also differs from practices such as traditional craft production, where a craftsperson may perform all the tasks to produce a final product, and job enlargement where the scope of a job may be extended.

== History ==
Records show job rotation has been used by communal societies, such as the Shakers since the nineteenth century.

There is evidence that job rotation has been practiced by firms in Japan since the early 1950’s. Toyo Kogyo Company the Japanese firm that now produces Mazda automobiles, has been one such company. Toyo has used job rotation to redeploy staff during economic events, but does exclude some expert areas from their system (e.g. research and development).

Potentially due to the widespread usage of job rotation in Japan and the success of Japanese firms, interest in job rotation increased in the United States of America in the 1980&#x27;s.

The concept of job rotation has also been used to develop active labor market policies. A scheme introduced in Denmark in the early 1990’s supported unemployed people to rotate into the jobs of employed people, to enable them to participate in further training.

==Benefits==
Job rotation offers numerous benefits for both organisations and employees:

=== Organisations ===

* Workforce flexibility: From an organizational perspective, job rotation promotes a more flexible workforce by allowing employees to gain experience across multiple areas. Organizations benefit from this cross-functional experience because having a more flexible, multi-skilled workforce enables employees that can be redeployed as needed. Such flexibility minimizes operational disruptions and enables organisations to respond swiftly to shifting organizational demands such as in times of employee absence or organizational change. Moreover, a flexible workforce is better equipped to innovate and solve complex problems, thereby enhancing overall effectiveness and responsiveness.
* Improved performance: Job rotation can significantly enhance both individual and organizational performance. As employees are exposed to different areas, it facilitates knowledge transfer and best practice sharing throughout the organisation which can lead to increased innovation and improved processes. Also, through job rotation, employees gain broader experience and develop new skills, it results in them bringing fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to their roles, which can lead to improved overall job performance and increased value to the organisation. 
* Enhanced public service delivery: In the public sector, job rotation through various departments offers a holistic understanding of public service delivery. When staff members are familiar with multiple roles and departments, they can approach problems with a more comprehensive perspective, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. This holistic understanding allows employees to address public policy issues, ensuring that services are delivered more efficiently and effectively.

=== Employee ===

* Skill development: One of the primary benefits of job rotation is that it helps develop workers’ knowledge and skills within the organisation. By rotating through various roles, employees are exposed to diverse tasks, responsibilities, and tools which broadens their skill sets and knowledge base. This experience equips employees with transferable skills, making them more adaptable to organizational changes and more capable of managing complex tasks across different departments.
* Increased job satisfaction and motivation: Job rotation significantly contributes to increased job satisfaction and motivation. By introducing of new tasks and responsibilities, it provides new challenges, reduces boredom, helps prevent burnout and leads to improved staff morale. This variety helps to foster engagement and a positive work environment, improving overall job satisfaction.
* Broader organizational understanding: Job rotation provides employees with an opportunity to gain insights into the organization&#x27;s diverse work and how their roles impact overall operations. By working across various roles and departments, employees develop a holistic understanding of the organization&#x27;s processes, goals, and interdependencies. This broader view enables employees to better understand how their work contributes to the organisation, while also equipping employees to collaborate more effectively across teams, share knowledge, break down silos and improve communication.
* Career growth opportunities: As a tool for training and development, this practice fosters diverse skill-building and better prepares individuals for career advancement. By experiencing various roles, employees gain a deeper understanding of different career paths and organizational functions. This is especially beneficial for those aspiring to management positions. Additionally, exposure to various roles and departments also enhances versatility and adaptability, making employees more competitive for promotions and leadership roles.
* Health and well-being: Incorporating job rotation can have a positive impact on employees&#x27; health and well-being. It alleviates physical strain and reduces stress, particularly in roles involving repetitive physical tasks and physically demanding jobs. Similarly, employees in mentally demanding roles can benefit from rotating into different tasks, which helps reduce mental fatigue and stress. By varying tasks and responsibilities, job rotation can help reduce the physical and mental stress that often comes with repetitive work, contributing to a healthier and more engaged workforce.
* Employee retention: Fostering a sense of growth and value among employees can significantly impact retention. Employees who are given the opportunity to rotate through various roles often feel that their organisation is investing in their development, which encourages loyalty and reduces turnover. Providing growth opportunities internally through job rotation can also improve employee retention, as it prevents skilled workers from seeking them externally. The continuous learning opportunities provided through job rotation help maintain employee engagement, further reducing the likelihood of employees leaving the organisation.

== Drawbacks ==
Job rotation also presents several challenges for organisations and employees:

=== Organisations ===
* Increased training resource costs: Job rotation incurs both direct and indirect costs. Direct expenses include the financial cost for training employees across other roles, while indirect costs arise from the time and resources needed for effective role transitions. During the learning phase, employees may make more errors, leading to further costs and reduced operational efficiency. Given that approximately one-third of U.S. employees and one fifth of Europe employees change jobs within a 12-month period, the costs associated with job rotation may not be justified for some organizations.
* Temporary productivity losses: Job rotation is often associated with an initial temporary reduction in productivity, as employees undergo a learning curve while transitioning into new roles. Loss of productivity occurs as employees learn new roles, transfer skills and familiarize themselves with new team dynamics. This productivity loss can affect both the department the employee is leaving and the department receiving the employee.  
* Employees’ resistance to change: Employees may resist job rotation due to unfamiliar roles, anxiety or lack of motivation to learn new tasks. Some employees may feel protective of their current role, especially if they have developed expertise and derive personal satisfaction from their position. Additionally, concerns about losing skills, job stability or the perception that increased responsibilities from rotation are not adequately reflected in wages may fuel resistance.
* Decreased employee accountability: Frequent job rotations can diminish individual accountability, as employees may feel less responsible for long-term outcomes, reducing efforts and engagement. This can make it challenging for expectations to be met, leading to increased stress.
* Organizational resistance to job rotation: Implementing job rotation may face resistance from both leadership and employees. In larger or more complex organizations, where knowledge-sharing systems and job structures are more bureaucratic, the effectiveness of job rotation strategies may diminish. Additionally, resistance may also arise from organizational cultures that are reluctant to share knowledge or adapt to changes brought by job rotation.
* Factors limit the implementation of job rotation: In industries requiring highly specialized skills, such as in law or medicine, job rotation may be impractical. Additionally, the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence and automation of repetitive tasks reduces the need for job rotation in certain sectors.

=== Employees ===
* Burnout and exhaustion: Frequent or poorly managed job rotation can lead to employee exhaustion and burnout. Employees might experience mental fatigue or heighten stress from constantly having to adapt to new roles, particularly when there isn’t adequate support.
* Increased workload and underperformance: Employees may excel in certain roles, but underperform in others, especially when rotations occur too quickly or without adequate training. Furthermore, employees may be rotated into a role they are not well-suited for. If a previous employee underperforms within a role, it can lead to an increased workload for the next employee, who must compensate for unfinished tasks or mistakes.
* Increased injury risk: Job rotation is often used to reduce physical strain from repetitive tasks. However evidence on its effectiveness in preventing musculoskeletal complaints is contradictory and open to interpretation. Rotating employees into jobs with a high risk of injury can increase the overall risk of workplace injuries. Insufficient training or rotating unskilled workers into more physical or mentally demanding roles may further elevate the risk of injury.
* Reduced expertise and role clarity: Frequent job rotation can hinder employees from developing deep expertise in one area, creating confusion about employee’s individual roles and responsibilities. This reduction in task specialization can lower productivity and reduce product quality.
* Increased job dissatisfaction and slowed career growth: Job rotation can make it challenging for managers to assess individual’s long-term contributions and skill developments, potentially limiting recognition and slowing career progression. Employees may feel overlooked, leading to increased job dissatisfaction.

<doc id="245488" wikidata="Q146356" url="?curid=245488" title="Chomutov">
<text>Chomutov (; ) is a city in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 47,000 inhabitants. There are almost 80,000 inhabitants in the city&#x27;s wider metropolitan area. The historic city centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Chomutov consists of only one municipal part and is the only such Czech statutory city.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the personal name Chomút/Chomout, meaning &quot;Chomout&#x27;s (court)&quot;. The word &quot;chomút&quot;, from which the personal name arise, denoted a clumsy person in Old Czech.

==Geography==
Chomutov is located about northwest of Prague. It lies on the Chomutovka River in the Ore Mountains Foothills. The surface is mostly flat with some hills in the north and southeast of the city. The highest point of the municipal territory is Hůrka , a hill on the northwestern municipal border.

There are several bodies of water on the outskirts of the city. Lake Kamencové jezero and the fishpond Velký Otvický rybník are used for recreational purposes.

==History==

The first written mention of Chomutov is a deed of gift from 1252, when it came into the possession of the Teutonic Order. The Gothic church of St. Catherine built during that era still stands to this day. In 1396 Chomutov received a town charter, and in 1416 the knights sold both the town and the lordship to Wenceslaus IV.

On 16 March 1421, the town was stormed, sacked and burned by the Taborites. After several upheavals and changes of ownership, Chomutov was taken by Popel of Lobkowitz in 1588, who established Jesuit rule, leading to trouble between the Protestant citizens and the town&#x27;s new overlord. In 1594 the feudal lordship fell to the crown, and in 1605 the town purchased its freedom and was made a royal city. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Chomutov stagnated. Rapid development did not come until the second half of the 19th century, with advances in the mining and heavy industries.

By 1938, Chomutov had over 30,000 inhabitants. It had a population comprising about 95% ethnic Germans. A very small Jewish population (444 in 1930 – 1.3% of the total population) came under increasing pressure, and Chomutov was declared &quot;Judenrein&quot; on 23 September 1938 by the increasingly pro-Nazi administration. A week later, Chomutov and its surrounding districts were annexed by Nazi Germany as a result of the 1938 Munich Agreement and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland.

After 1945, the previous population, German by a large majority, was expelled. Industrial facilities and large high-rise housing projects were then built to redevelop the area. In the late 1970s an urban settlement was built, linking Chomutov with its neighbouring Jirkov. Following the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the heavy industry significantly decreased its activity, but the environment in and around the town has been visibly improved. The leisure facilities of the area were emphasised, notably Alum Lake, the Zoopark Chomutov and the Bezručovo Valley recreational area.

Since 1 July 2006, Chomutov has been a statutory city.

On the opposite side there is the Church of Assumption of the Virgin Mary, built in late Gothic style between 1518 and 1542. The church is situated next to the tall dominant of the city, the City Tower. The tower was renovated after the fire in 1525 and rebuilt to neo-Gothic style in 1874. Nowadays it is used as an observation tower.

At the end of the south side there is the Baroque Church of Saint Ignatius with two towers on the north frontage. The church was built for Jesuits by Carlo Lurago between 1663 and 1668.

<text>Oneida Limited () is an American manufacturer and seller of tableware and cutlery. Oneida is one of the world&#x27;s largest designers and sellers of stainless steel and silverplated cutlery and tableware for the consumer and foodservice industries. It is also the largest supplier of dinnerware to the foodservice industry in North America. The company operates in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia, marketing and distributing tabletop products, which include flatware, dinnerware, crystal stemware, glassware and kitchen tools and gadgets. The factory in upstate NY was sold to Liberty Tabletop, who is the sole manufacturer of US made flatware. The company originated in the late-nineteenth century in the Oneida Community in Oneida, New York.

==History==

===Origins===
The company arose out of the Oneida Community, which was established in Oneida, New York, in 1848. The Oneida Association (later Oneida Community) was founded by a small group of Christian Perfectionists led by John Humphrey Noyes, Jonathan Burt, George W. Cragin, Harriet A.Noyes, George W. Noyes, John L. Skinner and a few others. In 1880, after more than 30 years operating as a commune, the Oneida Community voted to transfer much of the common property to a joint-stock company to be known as Oneida Community Ltd. effective January 1, 1881.

Oneida Community Ltd. was one of the earliest joint-stock companies in the United States. Its founders&#x27; religious philosophy helped inform the early development of the company, in which members of the former Oneida Community became shareholders in the company. Its progressive nature also allowed for a woman, Harriet Joselyn, to sit on the board of directors — a departure from the norm for the time.

Oneida Community started production of silver-plated flatware and hollow-ware in 1899 using the &quot;Community Plate&quot; mark. The Oneida Community purchased the Wm A. Rogers company in 1881. In 1929, the merged company began producing a somewhat lower-quality line of products using those companies’ marks. In 1935, Oneida Community changed its name to Oneida Ltd.

===Post-war growth===
Oneida Limited successfully adapted to the difficult economic conditions of the First World War and Second World War. Throughout both of these world economic upheavals, Oneida adapted its manufacturing capabilities. During the First World War, it produced ammunition clips, lead-plated gas shells, combat knives, and surgical instruments; during World War II, the company added army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and even jet engine parts to its manufacturing repertoire.

The company then managed an innovative transition to the manufacture of stainless steel flatware in 1961, which eventually dwarfed its production of silver-plated flatware. In 1976, Oneida purchased the Camden Wire Co., Inc., a major manufacturer of industrial wire products.

By the 1980s, Oneida made at least half of all flatware purchased in the United States. In 1983, the company acquired Rena-Ware, a Bellevue-based kitchenware manufacturer with a majority international operations. Oneida sold Rena-ware three years later. In 1984, it acquired D.J. Tableware, a flatware and china manufacturer that targeted the foodservice industry.

===Modern era===
At the end of the 1990s, the company encountered tough economic times, however it still tried to hold on to its mantle as the last remaining U.S.-based manufacturer of flatware, knives, forks, and spoons. The events surrounding 9/11 negatively affected the hospitality and consumer tableware markets, and in November 2003, Oneida sold its 100-year-old Buffalo China plant and four overseas factories in Mexico, China, and Italy. In February 2004, it sold off more assets to BC Acquisition Co. LLC for $5.5 million. Eventually, the manufacturing facilities in Sherrill, New York were sold to Sherrill Manufacturing on March 22, 2005.

In 1996, Oneida Limited acquired THC Systems, Inc., including its team of professionals, which operated under the name Rego China.

Oneida Limited transitioned from its manufacturing history and focused on design and marketing of its products that are globally sourced. Sales, marketing, advertising, procurement, customer service, legal and operational support is also still based in Oneida, New York. The company was taken private in 2006. Oneida no longer operates manufacturing in the United States.

Partly as a consequence of the economic blowback from 9/11, Oneida Limited&#x27;s sales fell more than $157 million. In 2006, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After stabilizing financially and reducing its debt load, the company was purchased by a group of hedge funds led by Monarch Alternative Capital.

Oneida announced at the beginning of 2009 they were transitioning away from company-owned outlet stores due to poor financial results but retaining the original outlet store in Sherrill, New York. In September 2010, Oneida launched a new website, Oneida.com.

In November 2011, Oneida Limited was acquired by Monomoy Capital Partners, a mid-sized New York City equity fund. In 2012, Monomoy merged Oneida with Anchor Hocking and created EveryWare Global. In January 2014, EveryWare Global announced its plans to close its regional office and the Oneida outlet store, both in Sherrill, NY, with the process starting in April. 
The original Oneida outlet store in Sherrill, New York, was closed April 26, 2014. EveryWare Global filed for bankruptcy in 2015. EveryWare Global was renamed The Oneida Group in 2017.

In January 2019, The Oneida Group sold the majority of its foodservice business (excluding Anchor Hocking glassware) to Crown Brands, LLC. Subsequently, in January 2020, Crown Brands renamed itself to Oneida Hospitality Group.

In June 2021, Oneida Consumer LLC, including the Oneida brand, was acquired by competitor Lenox Corporation. On July 13, 2021, The Oneida Group was renamed to Anchor Hocking Holdings, Inc.

==Operations==

===Manufacturing===
Oneida has had a variety of manufacturing facilities and capabilities throughout its existence. In addition to tableware, the company started out by manufacturing silk, traps, and chains. It gradually ceased these enterprises as they became less profitable for the company. In 1916, Oneida opened its first international factory in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

During World War II, Oneida purchased a factory in Canastota, New York, to manufacture army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and jet engine parts.

Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Oneida&#x27;s workforce grew from 2,000 to 3,000 workers, and it transitioned into manufacturing stainless steel flatware. Starting in 1977, and continuing throughout the 80s and 90s, Oneida acquired orthogonal manufacturing companies making such things as wire, flatware, and china. To compete with international manufacturing, Oneida implemented high-volume manufacturing lines in its factories. It also opened new factories throughout the world: a dinnerware factory in Juarez, Mexico; flatware factory in Toluca, Mexico; holloware factory in Shanghai, China; holloware factory in Vercelli, Italy. In 2004, it closed those factories.

Since its acquisition by Monomoy Capital Partners, Oneida has manufactured its products across North America, South America, Asia, and Europe by means of 50 manufacturing contracts.

===Advertising===
Starting in 1899, Coles Phillips illustrated dozens of ads for the company, which was then known as Oneida Community. Maxfield Parrish, John Whitcomb also illustrated advertisements for the Oneida&#x27;s products

Oneida also focused on print advertisements in home, fashion, bridal, and epicurean publications. It was also one of the first to employ celebrity spokespeople such as Bob Hope. Oneida inaugurated the practice by employing Irene Castle to promote its wares.
During the 1960s, Deutsch Inc. worked on Oneida&#x27;s advertising. More recently, Oneida&#x27;s advertising campaigns have won several Clio Awards.

==Brands==
Oneida Limited serves various customer segments by selling different brands of banquetware, flatware, glassware, and tableware. Its foodservice industry brands are Schonwald, Sant&#x27;Andrea, Oneida, and Buffalo. Its consumer products include the Oneida, Westminster and Stanley Rogers brands.

===Schonwald===
Oneida Limited is the exclusive American marketer and distributor of Schonwald foodservice dinnerware. The line is known for its trendsetting designs, advanced technology, and high quality. Schonwald is the company&#x27;s 5-star luxury brand of foodservice dinnerware.

===Sant&#x27;Andrea===
Oneida Limited established the European-based Sant&#x27;Andrea brand in 1990. The line focuses on premium stainless steel or traditional silverplate flatware. Oneida, through its Italian subsidiary, Sant&#x27;Andrea, S.r.l., acquired Table Top Engineering &amp; Design, S.r.l. in 1998. TTE&amp;D had been the primary manufacturer of its Sant&#x27;Andrea line of fine foodservice dinnerware.

===Oneida===

Oneida Limited&#x27;s main line has been available since the company&#x27;s very beginning. The Oneida line is broken up into three sub-lines: Oneida Flatware, Oneida Holloware, and Oneida Dinnerware. The Oneida line of flatware and dinnerware is used by fine dining establishments, family restaurants, and hotels.

===Buffalo===
In 1983, Oneida Limited purchased Buffalo China, Inc., at the time one of the country&#x27;s largest makers of commercial chinaware. After Oneida&#x27;s 2004 series of factory closings and sales, Buffalo China ceased manufacturing, but Oneida retained the Buffalo China trademark and logos; it also retained the Buffalo China warehouse in Buffalo, New York. The &quot;Buffalo Collection&quot; is Oneida&#x27;s casual line of dinnerware, focusing on durability, practicality, and detail.

<text>Sanremo, also spelled San Remo in English and formerly in Italian, is a (municipality) on the Mediterranean coast of Liguria, in northwestern Italy. Founded in Roman times, it has a population of 55,000, and is known as a tourist destination on the Italian Riviera. It hosts numerous cultural events, such as the Sanremo Music Festival and the Milan–San Remo cycling classic.

==Name==

While it is often stated in modern folk stories that Sanremo is named after a legendary Saint Remus, the name of the city is actually a phonetic contraction of (&quot;Holy Hermitage of Saint Romulus&quot;), which refers to Romulus of Genoa, the successor to Syrus of Genoa. In Ligurian, its name is or .

The non-univerbated spelling &quot;San Remo&quot; features on ancient maps of Liguria and maps of the Republic of Genoa, Medieval Italy, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Kingdom of Italy; it was used in 1924 in official documents under Mussolini. This form of the name, now superseded by &quot;Sanremo&quot; both officially and in common usage, still appears on some road signs and, more rarely, in unofficial tourist information.

==History==

Once the Roman settlement of &quot;Matutia&quot; or &quot;Villa Matutiana&quot;, Sanremo expanded in the early Middle Ages when the population moved to the high grounds. The nobility built a castle and the walled village of La Pigna to protect the town from Saracen raids.

At first subjected to the countship of Ventimiglia, the community later passed under the dominion of the Genoese bishops. In 1297 they sold it to the Doria and De Mari families. It became a free town in the second half of the 15th century, after which it expanded to the Pigna hill and at Saint Syrus Cathedral. The almost perfectly preserved old village remains.

Sanremo remained independent of the Genoese Republic. In 1753, after 20 years of fierce conflicts, it rose against Genoese hegemonical attempts. At that time Genoa built the fortress of Santa Tecla, situated on the beach near the port. The fortress was used as a prison until 2002. It is now used as a museum.

After the French domination and the Savoy restoration in 1814, Sanremo was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. From the middle of the 18th century, the town grew rapidly, in part due to the development of tourism, which saw the first grand hotels built and the town extended along the coast. The Empress &quot;Sissi&quot; of Austria, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia took vacations in Sanremo, while Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel made it his permanent home.

The San Remo conference, 19–26 April 1920, of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council determined the allocation of Class &quot;A&quot; League of Nations mandates for the administration of the former Ottoman-ruled lands of the Middle East by the victorious powers. The most notable of these was the British Mandate of Palestine.

In 1972, the first public demonstration for the defence of the dignity and rights of gay people in Italy took place in Sanremo in protest against an international congress on sexual deviance organized by the Catholic-inspired Italian Center for Sexology.

==Economy==
Sanremo&#x27;s Mediterranean climate and attractive seacoast setting on the Italian Riviera make it a popular tourist destination. Besides tourism, the city is active in the production of extra virgin-grade olive oil, whose regional &quot;designation of origin&quot; is protected (D.O.P., &quot;Denominazione di Origine Protetta&quot;). It is one of the agricultural commodities in western Liguria and in particular within the province of Imperia. Sanremo is known as the City of Flowers (&quot;la Città dei Fiori&quot;), this being another important aspect of the economy of the city. The nearby towns of Arma di Taggia, Bordighera and Ospedaletti are also involved in the cultivation of flowers for the international flower market.

The Municipal Casino, built in 1905, is an example of Art Nouveau building. The Ariston Theatre offers an annual series of concerts, operas and theatre plays. The Symphony Orchestra is one of twelve symphony orchestras recognized by the state of Italy; it performs some 120 concerts throughout the year, most in the Municipal Casino&#x27;s Opera Theatre.

==Transportation==

The city is connected to Genoa and to Ventimiglia, the border city with France, by the A10 motorway, whose last part is also known as the &quot;Autostrada dei Fiori&quot; (&quot;Motorway of Flowers&quot;). It has a large number of elevated sections with viaducts that give a panoramic view of the coast. The A10 joins the French A8 highway at the border between Ventimiglia and Menton. Together these national routes are part of the European route E80. The A10 motorway is a toll road, and the A8 demands a toll in sections, and some sections are free of charge. When travelling from Italy into France, one does not pay until after the towns of Menton and Monaco.

Other roads of importance are the SS1, the &quot;Aurelia Bis&quot;, which connects Sanremo to Taggia. This is a non-toll bypass route. The coast road is the via Aurelia or SS1 and follows the route of a Roman road. This can be heavily congested when it passes through towns, as it has only one lane in either direction for most of the way around Sanremo. A trolleybus line along the via Aurelia links Sanremo with both Taggia and Ventimiglia.

The closest airport to Sanremo is in France, the Côte d&#x27;Azur International Airport in Nice, 45 minutes away by car. The railway connects the city to other Ligurian cities like Imperia, Genoa and to Nice, Milan, Turin and Rome.

The railway line used to be along the coast, running close to the sea, and providing a view for travellers. The line has been moved further north and underground, which allows for faster trains; Sanremo railway station was relocated next to the City Hall. The city has refurbished the old railway line and converted it into a bike route and pedestrian area. There are several bike hire kiosks along the route and a choice of beaches to visit in either direction from San Remo. The path stretches between Ospedaletti in the west and San Lorenzo al Mare in the east.

=== Climate ===
Sanremo experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;).

==Culture==

===Music festival===

The Ariston Theatre hosts the celebrated annual Sanremo Music Festival, which has been held in the city since 1951. This festival inspired the Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, and has often been used to select the Italian entry for the European contest. The internationally notable song &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Volare&quot;, was performed at this festival for the first time by Domenico Modugno in 1958. The festival is so popular among Italians that it is often referred to simply as &quot;Il Festival&quot; (&quot;The&quot; Festival). Other events include the Tenco Prize (autumn), a song contest for authors dedicated to the memory of Luigi Tenco; the Flowers Parade in January/February in which every city of the Italian Riviera presents an original composition of flowers displayed on a Carnival/Mardi-Gras style moving car; and the summer Firework International Contest in the second week of August also called Ferragosto.

===Cuisine===
The culinary specialities of Sanremo and its environs include Sardenara, Focaccia, Focaccia alle Cipolle, Torta Verde, Farinata and Taggiasca olives.

===Gambling===
The Sanremo Casino (&quot;Casino Municipale di Sanremo&quot;) opened in 1905 and has operated continuously since then with the exception of the years of World War II. For much of its history, the casino was tolerated or granted exceptions to Italian gambling laws in order to allow the resort to compete with the casino towns in nearby France and Monaco.

Sanremo hosts an annual poker tournament as part of the European Poker Tour. The city is widely accepted as the origin of the five-card stud variant &quot;telesina&quot;.

==Sports==

The Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition that was part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 1973 to 2003, when it was replaced by Rally d&#x27;Italia Sardegna on the island of Sardinia, in hosting the Italian round of the WRC. It is now part of European Rally Championship. Formerly a mixed surface event (tarmac and gravel), the rally has later been an all-tarmac event and takes place around the mountains.

Sanremo is the finish of the classic Milan–San Remo cycle race. It is considered to be a &quot;monument&quot; – one of the five most important one-day races of the cycling season. Milan – San Remo is traditionally held in March and is one of the first major fixtures of the cycling season. It is usually the longest professional one-day race in the cycling season, giving the race a unique character.

The most important local football club is the Sanremese which has played also in Serie B and in Serie C.

<text>Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War (2001) is a historical narrative about the events of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. It was written by the Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan with a foreword by the American diplomat Richard Holbrooke. The book has also been published under the titles Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World and Peacemakers: Six Months That Changed the World.

&quot;Peacemakers&quot; describes the six months of negotiations that took place in Paris, France, following World War I. The book focuses on the &quot;Big Three&quot;, who are photographed together on its cover (left to right): Prime Minister David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau of France, and President Woodrow Wilson of the United States.

The author argues that the conditions imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles did not lead to the rise of Adolf Hitler and asks whether the Great War was &quot;an unmitigated catastrophe in a sea of mud&quot;, or instead was &quot;about something&quot;. She concludes, &quot;It is condescending and wrong to think they were hoodwinked&quot;.

During the later part of the war, the British prime minister was David Lloyd George, the author&#x27;s great-grandfather.

==Reception==
The book was first published in Britain. It won the £5,000 Duff Cooper Prize for an outstanding literary work in the field of history, biography or politics, the £3,000 Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History, the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for the best work of non-fiction published in the United Kingdom, and the 2003 Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award in Canada.

The book was adapted as a 2009 docudrama film entitled &quot;Paris 1919&quot;, by Paul Cowan, produced by the National Film Board of Canada. MacMillan recorded a related series of fourteen lectures for the audiobook &quot;Six Months That Changed the World: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919&quot; (Recorded Books, The Modern Scholar series, 2003).

<doc id="245523" wikidata="Q1520657" url="?curid=245523" title="Weight function">
<text>A weight function is a mathematical device used when performing a sum, integral, or average to give some elements more &quot;weight&quot; or influence on the result than other elements in the same set. The result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average. Weight functions occur frequently in statistics and analysis, and are closely related to the concept of a measure. Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called &quot;weighted calculus&quot; and &quot;meta-calculus&quot;.

== Discrete weights ==
=== General definition ===
In the discrete setting, a weight function formula_1 is a positive function defined on a discrete set formula_2, which is typically finite or countable. The weight function formula_3 corresponds to the &quot;unweighted&quot; situation in which all elements have equal weight. One can then apply this weight to various concepts.

If the function formula_4 is a real-valued function, then the &quot;unweighted sum of formula_5 on formula_2&quot; is defined as

:formula_7

but given a &quot;weight function&quot; formula_8, the weighted sum or conical combination is defined as

:formula_9

One common application of weighted sums arises in numerical integration.

If &quot;B&quot; is a finite subset of &quot;A&quot;, one can replace the unweighted cardinality |&quot;B&quot;| of &quot;B&quot; by the &quot;weighted cardinality&quot; 

:formula_10

If &quot;A&quot; is a finite non-empty set, one can replace the unweighted mean or average 

:formula_11

by the weighted mean or weighted average 

:formula_12

In this case only the &quot;relative&quot; weights are relevant.

=== Statistics ===
Weighted means are commonly used in statistics to compensate for the presence of bias. For a quantity formula_5 measured multiple independent times formula_14 with variance formula_15, the best estimate of the signal is obtained by averaging all the measurements with weight and the resulting variance is smaller than each of the independent measurements The maximum likelihood method weights the difference between fit and data using the same weights 

The expected value of a random variable is the weighted average of the possible values it might take on, with the weights being the respective probabilities. More generally, the expected value of a function of a random variable is the probability-weighted average of the values the function takes on for each possible value of the random variable.

In regressions in which the dependent variable is assumed to be affected by both current and lagged (past) values of the independent variable, a distributed lag function is estimated, this function being a weighted average of the current and various lagged independent variable values. Similarly, a moving average model specifies an evolving variable as a weighted average of current and various lagged values of a random variable.

=== Mechanics ===
The terminology &quot;weight function&quot; arises from mechanics: if one has a collection of formula_16 objects on a lever, with weights formula_17 (where weight is now interpreted in the physical sense) and locations then the lever will be in balance if the fulcrum of the lever is at the center of mass 

:formula_18

which is also the weighted average of the positions 

== Continuous weights ==
In the continuous setting, a weight is a positive measure such as formula_19 on some domain formula_20, which is typically a subset of a Euclidean space formula_21, for instance formula_20 could be an interval formula_23. Here formula_24 is Lebesgue measure and formula_25 is a non-negative measurable function. In this context, the weight function formula_26 is sometimes referred to as a density.

=== General definition ===
If formula_27 is a real-valued function, then the &quot;unweighted&quot; integral

:formula_28

can be generalized to the &quot;weighted integral&quot; 

:formula_29

Note that one may need to require formula_5 to be absolutely integrable with respect to the weight formula_19 in order for this integral to be finite.

=== Weighted volume ===
If &quot;E&quot; is a subset of formula_20, then the volume vol(&quot;E&quot;) of &quot;E&quot; can be generalized to the &quot;weighted volume&quot; 
:formula_33

=== Weighted average ===
If formula_20 has finite non-zero weighted volume, then we can replace the unweighted average 

:formula_35

by the weighted average 

:formula_36

=== Bilinear form ===
If formula_37 and formula_38 are two functions, one can generalize the unweighted bilinear form 

:formula_39

to a weighted bilinear form 

:formula_40

See the entry on orthogonal polynomials for examples of weighted orthogonal functions.

<doc id="245524" wikidata="Q1057910" url="?curid=245524" title="Battle of Guandu">
<text>The Battle of Guandu was fought between the warlords Cao Cao and Yuan Shao in 200 AD in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Cao&#x27;s decisive victory against Yuan Shao&#x27;s numerically superior forces marked the turning point in their war. The victory was also the point at which Cao Cao became the dominant power in northern China, leading to the establishment of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period.

== Background ==
The inevitability of military conflict between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had become apparent by 196. Yuan Shao held control of the lands north of the Yellow River, namely the Hebei region, while Cao Cao controlled most of the lands south of the Yellow River after he defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi in 199 and kept Emperor Xian with him in the new capital city of Xu. The warlords saw each other as the obvious impediment to their individual ambitions to conquer and rule China.

Some years before the battle, Yuan Shao&#x27;s advisors Ju Shou and Tian Feng warned that Cao Cao would become a threat to their lord in his ambition to dominate China. They advised Yuan Shao to attack Cao Cao when the latter was still building up his forces, but Yuan Shao ignored their advice as Cao Cao was still nominally an ally. Tension between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao increased after Cao Cao moved Emperor Xian from the old capital Luoyang.

== Prelude ==

The geographical position of Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan) made it a strategically vital position. It was near Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) on the Yellow River and lay on the road leading to the capital city Xu. Cao Cao recognized its strategic importance and in the autumn of 199, he stationed troops there and prepared fortifications. Other deployments along the frontline included Liu Yan () at Boma (白馬; near present-day Hua County, Henan), Yu Jin at Yan Ford, Cheng Yu at Juancheng (鄄城; near present-day Juancheng County, Shandong), and Xiahou Dun at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan). At the same time, Cao Cao sent Zang Ba to harass Qing Province (), which was governed by Yuan Shao&#x27;s son Yuan Tan, to prevent his eastern flank from coming under attack.

In the first month of 200, Liu Bei rebelled against Cao Cao and seized Xu Province after killing Che Zhou (), Cao Cao&#x27;s appointed Inspector () of Xu Province. Cao Cao, in an unexpected move, left his northern front exposed to Yuan Shao and turned east to retake Xu Province. Yuan Shao tried to use the opportunity to start a campaign south, but was daunted by Yu Jin, the defender of Yan Ford.

When Cao Cao returned to Guandu after his victory over Liu Bei, who sought refuge under Yuan Shao afterwards, Yuan Shao decided to renew the campaign against Cao Cao. The aide-de-camp () Tian Feng, who had urged Yuan Shao to attack Cao Cao while he was away, advised against such a campaign, reasoning that they had lost their chance and must wait. Yuan Shao ignored Tian Feng&#x27;s repeated remonstrations and imprisoned him under charges of demoralizing the army.

Shortly after, Yuan Shao had Chen Lin draft a document condemning Cao Cao in what was essentially a declaration of war, and marched his main army toward the forward base of Liyang (黎陽; northwest of present-day Xun County, Henan) north of the river. At the time, Yuan Shao&#x27;s army boasted of numbers up to 110,000, including 10,000 cavalry.

== Skirmishes along the Yellow River ==
Yuan Shao&#x27;s general Yan Liang crossed the Yellow River and besieged Cao Cao&#x27;s fort at Boma. Heeding his advisor Xun You&#x27;s advice, Cao Cao led a battalion toward Yan Ford as a feint to trick Yuan Shao into believing that Cao Cao would attack his camp on the other side of the river. Yuan Shao split off his troops from Liyang to counter Cao Cao&#x27;s attack, leaving Yan Liang without any support at Boma. Cao Cao then struck eastward to lift the siege on Boma. In the ensuing battle, Yan Liang was killed by Guan Yu and Yuan Shao&#x27;s army was routed.

Cao Cao decided to abandon the fort and evacuate its occupants to the south. Taking advantage of the situation, Wen Chou and Liu Bei led 6,000 horsemen in pursuit. Cao Cao anticipated the attack and prepared a distraction tactic. He ordered his troops to discard their steeds, weapons and other valuables along the way. Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces broke their ranks to grab the valuables lying ahead. Just as they were claiming the items, 600 of Cao Cao&#x27;s elite cavalry that had been lying in ambush attacked them. Yuan Shao&#x27;s commander Wen Chou was killed and Liu Bei fled. Having lost two of their generals in these relatively minor skirmishes prior to the primary conflict at Guandu resulted in a crushing blow to the morale of Yuan Shao&#x27;s army.

== Advance on Yangwu and flanking attempts ==

Despite having won the preliminary battles, Cao Cao was still outnumbered. He abandoned the forward bases along the Yellow River in preparation for a determined defence at Guandu. Cao Cao also ordered his officials in charge of his lands in his absence to govern with lenience, so as to minimise chances of chaos within the civilian community that could affect his army&#x27;s morale.

After the engagements at the river, Yuan Shao&#x27;s army pushed to Yangwu (陽武; near present-day Yuanyang County, Henan), directly north of Guandu, and began constructing earthen fortifications. He ignored Cheng Yu&#x27;s bastion of 700 men at Juancheng and missed an opportunity to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s eastern flank, exactly as Cheng Yu&#x27;s predicted earlier when he guessed that Yuan Shao would ignore a position with so few men. Yuan Shao&#x27;s Attendant Officer () Ju Shou had reservations about concentrating all of the main army at Yangwu, and suggested leaving a garrison at Yan Ford as a precaution in case the attack on Guandu did not go well. Yuan Shao ignored the suggestion again. Ju Shou, in despair, tried to excuse himself by claiming to be ill, but Yuan Shao became annoyed at him and would not grant him leave. Instead, he divested Ju Shou&#x27;s men and divided them under the commands of Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong.

Yuan Shao reorganized his forces and sent Liu Bei with an army to support the rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang (㶏疆; southwest of present-day Xuchang), just 20 &quot;li&quot; south of the capital. Although Cao Cao was concerned about such developments in his rear, his cousin Cao Ren observed that Liu Bei could not have too much control over his new men given by Yuan Shao. So Cao Cao sent Cao Ren to deal with the rebellion. Cao Ren succeeded, killing the rebel leader Liu Pi and routing Liu Bei. Yuan Shao also tried to cut off Cao Cao from the west by sending Han Meng () southwest. Cao Ren again responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Mount Jiluo (雞洛山; 50 &quot;li&quot; northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao did not send any detached force into Cao Cao&#x27;s territory after this.

At Yangwu, several war plans were presented to Yuan Shao. Ju Shou observed that Cao Cao&#x27;s men were running out of grain, and thus it would be proper to enter a war of attrition, denying Cao Cao a decisive battle. Another advisor, Xu You suggested that Yuan Shao should maintain the front at Guandu but at the same time send men to circle around and capture the emperor in Xu. Yuan Shao accepted neither plan, saying he preferred to capture the emperor with a direct advance.

==Siege of Guandu==
In the eighth month, Yuan Shao&#x27;s army slowly advanced southward from Yangwu and engaged Cao Cao&#x27;s men in trench warfare, behind the earthen embankments that both sides made. Both sides harassed each other with engines of war. Yuan Shao had erected siege-ramps and high platforms which allowed his men to rain arrows onto Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. In response, Cao Cao&#x27;s men had to carry their shields above their heads, and retaliated with traction trebuchets that destroyed the archer platforms. Yuan Shao also tried to tunnel under Cao Cao&#x27;s fort, but Cao Cao had a large ditch dug within his lines to block the tunnels. Subsequently, neither side could overcome each other as Cao Cao and Yuan Shao became locked in a stalemate.

Before long, Cao Cao&#x27;s army began to run short of supplies and Cao Cao was in a dilemma on whether to retreat in order to lure Yuan Shao deeper into his territory. Xun Yu, the defender of the capital Xu, sent Cao Cao a letter dissuading him from retreat. He wrote, drawing historical examples from the Chu–Han Contention:

Cao Cao followed this advice and held fast to his ground. In the ninth month, Xun Yu pointed out that Yuan Shao had been storing supplies at a depot in the village of Gushi (故市; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan), guarded by Han Meng. Cao Cao sent out small cavalry units led by Xu Huang and Shi Huan () to attack this position. They succeeded, routing Han Meng, disrupting Yuan Shao&#x27;s supply lines, and burning his grain carts. Yuan Shao was forced to call for relief supplies in response to this raid.

==Raid on Wuchao==
In the tenth month, Yuan Shao&#x27;s general Chunyu Qiong returned with an army of 10,000 from Hebei escorting large reserves of food supplies. Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu to escort the supplies to Wuchao (烏巢; in present-day Yanjin County, Henan), a place 40 &quot;li&quot; away from Guandu near Gushi, and placed him in charge of guarding the supplies there. Yuan Shao&#x27;s advisor Ju Shou argued that Wuchao, being their important supply depot, was too lightly guarded and insisted that Yuan Shao should send the general Jiang Qi () to serve as a perimeter guard to Chunyu Qiong and cut off any potential raids. Yuan Shao, again, did not heed Ju Shou&#x27;s advice.

Shortly after, Yuan Shao&#x27;s advisor Xu You, who had harboured dissatisfaction against Yuan Shao for not following his plan and having his wife arrested by Shen Pei, defected over to Cao Cao. He understood Cao Cao&#x27;s shortage of supplies and alerted Cao Cao to Yuan Shao&#x27;s exploitable weakness at Wuchao. Cao Cao&#x27;s generals were suspicious of this piece of intelligence, but his advisors Xun You and Jia Xu urged Cao Cao to put Xu You&#x27;s plan to action. Thus at night, Cao Cao led 5,000 infantry and cavalry to attack Wuchao after leaving Cao Hong and Xun You in charge of his main camp at Guandu. Cao Cao&#x27;s army disguised itself as a reinforcement unit from Yuan Shao and attacked Wuchao. Chunyu Qiong&#x27;s initial defences were overrun, and he retreated to hold his forts, which Cao Cao attacked and set on fire.

When Yuan Shao&#x27;s camp received the news that Wuchao was under attack, Zhang He urged Yuan Shao to send reinforcements to Wuchao to save the supplies, on which the fate of the campaign hinged. Guo Tu, however, advocated the opposite: attack Cao Cao&#x27;s base at Guandu with the hope that Cao Cao will abandon the raid on Wuchao. Yuan Shao used Guo Tu&#x27;s idea and sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to lead his main army to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp at Guandu, while only sending a small cavalry unit to reinforce Wuchao.

Cao Cao ignored pleas to split off his force to deal with the reinforcements and readied his men to fight to the death. The raid on Wuchao was a great success, inflicting over a thousand casualties. Yuan Shao&#x27;s officers Lü Weihuang (), Han Juzi (), Sui Yuanjin (), and Zhao Rui () were decapitated; Chunyu Qiong was captured by Yue Jin and had his nose cut off. Almost all of Yuan Shao&#x27;s food supplies at Wuchao were burnt.

By dawn, Wuchao had turned into an inferno and the morale of Yuan Shao&#x27;s army plummeted sharply due to the loss of food supplies. Cao Cao also cut off the noses of the dead, mixed them with noses and lips of oxen and horses, and showed them to Yuan Shao&#x27;s men, as a form of intimidation.

Meanwhile, at Guandu, Yuan Shao&#x27;s army led by Zhang He and Gao Lan failed to break through the enemy lines. Affected by the news of the defeat in Wuchao and rumors of Guo Tu making slanderous remarks about them, Zhang He and Gao Lan surrendered to Cao Hong and destroyed their weapons. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces seized the opportunity to launch the full attack on Yuan&#x27;s army. Yuan Shao&#x27;s numerous armies were destroyed and much of his supplies were captured by Cao Cao. Yuan Shao himself fled north across the Yellow River with only about 800 cavalry, which was what was left of his army. Order was restored only when Yuan Shao reached the camp of his general Jiang Yiqu (), from where he gathered his straggling troops.

Some of Yuan Shao&#x27;s men could not cross the Yellow River in time and were captured by Cao Cao, including Ju Shou. Some of these men had feigned surrender so they could escape later, thus Cao Cao had these men buried alive. In his proclamation of victory to Emperor Xian, Cao Cao claimed to have killed 70,000 enemy troops.

== Aftermath ==
Cao Cao&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Guandu was a decisive one and marked the turn of the tide in his struggle for power with Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao died in June of 202 and his youngest son Yuan Shang was made his successor shortly thereafter. His oldest son Yuan Tan was furious with the succession and fought with his younger brother. This resulted in internal conflict within Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces. Yuan Shao&#x27;s pool of talented advisors and generals were also divided into two factions by the conflict – one supported Yuan Shang and the other supported Yuan Tan. Cao Cao seized the opportunity to launch an attack on Yuan Tan&#x27;s base at Liyang. Though Cao Cao eventually withdrew, Yuan Tan came to resent Yuan Shang even more during course of the battle, which led to open warfare between the brothers. Yuan Tan eventually allied with to Cao Cao against Yuan Shang, but Cao Cao accused him of violating some terms of the alliance and killed him in battle. On the other hand, Yuan Shang suffered defeats at the hands of Cao Cao and fled north to join his second brother Yuan Xi. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces pursued them and defeated the Wuhuan tribe, the Yuan brothers&#x27; ally, in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi fled to Liaodong to seek shelter under the warlord Gongsun Kang in 207, but Gongsun killed them instead and sent their heads to Cao Cao. By then, most of northern China was unified under Cao Cao&#x27;s control, and Cao Cao could begin to turn his attention to the south.

== Legacy and analysis ==
Throughout the ages, Cao Cao&#x27;s impressive victory at Guandu, the climactic event of his life, has drawn analysis by both historical commentators and militarists hoping to imitate his success.

The Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, compiler of the chronicle &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, remarked that while Yuan Shao was generous, elegant and able, he was also obstinate, self-satisfied, and seldom heeded reasonable advice. These negative attributes were the cause of his defeat.

In more recent times, both the Chinese Nationalists and Communists have picked up on this battle and made their own interpretations, in various degrees of objectivity.

The Nationalists followed traditional Chinese historiography in that they judged the battle in terms of personalities, rather than the situations and the tactics involved. For example, Cao Cao was seen as capable, decisive, and far-sighted, while Yuan Shao was derided as mediocre, slow, arrogant, and unable to employ men properly.

The Communist leader Mao Zedong, in his writings about strategic retreat, used the Battle of Guandu along with the Battle of Chenggao, Battle of Kunyang, Battle of Red Cliffs, Battle of Xiaoting, and Battle of Fei River to illustrate the concept. In all of these battles, he wrote, &quot;...the contestants were unequal in strength, and the weaker one yielding a step at first, pinned down the stronger one through delayed action and defeated him.&quot; Mao&#x27;s words attracted some attention to the battle, and many papers were written to analyze the Battle of Guandu in Maoist terms. The Maoist interpretation, while taking note of Yuan Shao&#x27;s serious errors of judgement, advocates that the strong enemy will make fateful errors, while the weaker opponent need only to await their appearance. The Marxist interpretation portrays Yuan Shao as the representative of the great landlord-official class, and Cao Cao as of the middle and small landlord class. The battle was thus a product of class conflict in which Yuan Shao&#x27;s fall was inevitable.

The historian Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao&#x27;s victory to one single strategic decision — the defender&#x27;s choice of location. Leban asserts that Cao Cao chose Guandu as the place to make his stand because of his superior understanding of the relation between topography, logistics, and tactics over Yuan Shao. It was the issue about logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao&#x27;s supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.

The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny is skeptical of the traditional viewpoint and questions Yuan Shao&#x27;s supposed advantage over Cao Cao. De Crespigny argues that Yuan Shao&#x27;s hold on his nominal territories were not as secure as Cao Cao, who had aggressively campaigned to stabilize his surroundings. Taking note that Yuan Shao took ten years to eliminate the isolated Gongsun Zan, de Crespigny suggests that it was not due to indecisiveness that Yuan Shao did not take advantage of Cao Cao&#x27;s temporal weaknesses, but that Yuan Shao might not have had the men to spare for such ventures. From such a perspective, Yuan Shao, faced with the ever-growing threat of his former ally Cao Cao, concentrated his force in a direct approach to Cao Cao&#x27;s headquarters in hope that such a strike would overwhelm his enemy. Though he was outwitted and defeated by Cao Cao, Yuan Shao&#x27;s decisions might not have been so foolish as numerous traditional historians and commentators have said.

<text>Mandatory labelling or labeling (see spelling differences) is the requirement of consumer products to state their ingredients or components. This is done to protect people with allergies, and so that people can practice moral purchasing. Mandatory labelling is mandated in most developed nations and increasingly also in developing nations, especially for food products, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Grade A&quot; meats. With regard to food and drugs, mandatory labelling has been a major battleground between consumer advocates and corporations since the late 19th century.

Because of past scandals involving deceptive labelling, countries like the United States and Canada require most processed foods to have a nutrition facts label on the label, and the table&#x27;s formatting and content must conform to strict guidelines. The European Union equivalent is the slightly different nutrition information table, which may also be supplemented with standardized icons indicating the presence of allergens. In China, all clothing is labelled with the factory of origin, including telephone and fax numbers, although this information is not available to buyers outside China, who see only a generic Made in China tag. In Brazil, food containing more than one percent of GM ingredients must be labelled as such.

The development of genetically modified food has led to one of the most persistent and divisive debates about mandatory labelling, which is one of the central topics in genetically modified food controversies. Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible health risk from consuming such foods. Detractors point to studies that conclude genetically modified food is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known.

Voluntary labelling and co-marketing of products deemed desirable is another matter usually carried out by entirely different means, &quot;e.g.&quot; Slow Food. There has been increased regulatory interest in substantiating these claims, and in some jurisdictions, food labels require regulatory approval before use. An interesting halfway is those labels that are considered mandatory by one buying population and effectively preclude purchase if they are not there, e.g. kosher, vegan, and the aforementioned GMO-free label now seen on many organic products.

Areas in which mandatory labelling is being discussed include:

* genetically modified food—see genetically modified food controversies
* spraying of meat with bacteriophages
* in the United States, fresh meat was added to the list of products which require mandatory country of origin labels (mCOOL) in 2002, however this was the subject of a challenge in the World Trade Organization by Canada, which Canada won in 2011

<doc id="245530" wikidata="Q5532436" url="?curid=245530" title="Generalized Fourier series">
<text>A generalized Fourier series is the expansion of a square integrable function into a sum of square integrable orthogonal basis functions. The standard Fourier series uses an orthonormal basis of trigonometric functions, and the series expansion is applied to periodic functions. In contrast, a generalized Fourier series uses any set of orthogonal basis functions and can apply to any square integrable function.

== Definition ==

Consider a set formula_1 of square-integrable complex valued functions defined on the closed interval formula_2 that are pairwise orthogonal under the weighted inner product:

formula_3

where formula_4 is a weight function and formula_5 is the complex conjugate of formula_6. Then, the generalized Fourier series of a function formula_7 is:
formula_8where the coefficients are given by:
formula_9

== Sturm-Liouville Problems ==
Given the space formula_10 of square integrable functions defined on a given interval, one can find orthogonal bases by considering a class of boundary value problems on the interval formula_2 called regular Sturm-Liouville problems. These are defined as follows, 
formula_12
formula_13
where formula_14 and formula_15 are real and continuous on formula_2 and formula_17 on formula_2, formula_19 and formula_20 are self-adjoint boundary conditions, and formula_21 is a positive continuous functions on formula_2.

Given a regular Sturm-Liouville problem as defined above, the set formula_23 of eigenfunctions corresponding to the distinct eigenvalue solutions to the problem form an orthogonal basis for formula_10 with respect to the weighted inner product formula_25. We also have that for a function formula_26 that satisfies the boundary conditions of this Sturm-Liouville problem, the series formula_27 converges uniformly to formula_7.

== Examples ==
=== Fourier–Legendre series ===
A function formula_29 defined on the entire number line is called periodic with period formula_30 if a number formula_31 exists such that, for any real number formula_32, the equality formula_33 holds.

If a function is periodic with period formula_30, then it is also periodic with periods formula_35, formula_36, and so on. Usually, the period of a function is understood as the smallest such number formula_30. However, for some functions, arbitrarily small values of formula_30 exist.

The sequence of functions formula_39 is known as the trigonometric system. Any linear combination of functions of a trigonometric system, including an infinite combination (that is, a converging infinite series), is a periodic function with a period of 2π.

On any segment of length 2π (such as the segments [−π,π] and [0,2π]) the trigonometric system is an orthogonal system. This means that for any two functions of the trigonometric system, the integral of their product over a segment of length 2π is equal to zero. This integral can be treated as a scalar product in the space of functions that are integrable on a given segment of length 2π.

Let the function formula_29 be defined on the segment [−π, π]. Given appropriate smoothness and differentiability conditions, formula_29 may be represented on this segment as a linear combination of functions of the trigonometric system, also referred to as the &quot;expansion&quot; of the function formula_29 into a trigonometric Fourier series.

The Legendre polynomials formula_43 are solutions to the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem

: formula_44

As a consequence of Sturm-Liouville theory, these polynomials are orthogonal eigenfunctions with respect to the inner product with unit weight. This can be written as a generalized Fourier series (known in this case as a Fourier–Legendre series) involving the Legendre polynomials, so that

:formula_45
:formula_46

As an example, the Fourier–Legendre series may be calculated for formula_47 over formula_48. Then

:formula_49

and a truncated series involving only these terms would be

:formula_50

which differs from formula_51 by approximately 0.003. In computational applications it may be advantageous to use such Fourier–Legendre series rather than Fourier series since the basis functions for the series expansion are all polynomials and hence the integrals and thus the coefficients may be easier to calculate.

== Coefficient theorems ==
Some theorems on the series&#x27; coefficients formula_52 include:

=== Bessel&#x27;s inequality ===
Bessel&#x27;s inequality is a statement about the coefficients of an element formula_32 in a Hilbert space with respect to an orthonormal sequence. The inequality was derived by F.W. Bessel in 1828:
:formula_54

=== Parseval&#x27;s theorem ===
Parseval&#x27;s theorem usually refers to the result that the Fourier transform is unitary; loosely, that the sum (or integral) of the square of a function is equal to the sum (or integral) of the square of its transform.

If Φ is a complete basis, then:

<doc id="245532" wikidata="Q5015420" url="?curid=245532" title="Cabin Fever (TV series)">
<text>Cabin Fever is an RTÉ reality TV show which was meant to have been broadcast over eight weeks starting on 3 June 2003. Disaster struck however two weeks into the broadcast when, on Friday 13 June 2003, the ship ran aground off Tory Island off the north-west coast near County Donegal.

&quot;Cabin Fever&quot; consisted of a group of eleven contestants chosen specially for the show, most of whom had no sailing experience (though they had received a quick course in sailing technique prior to setting sail), who were to be put on the 27.4 metre (90 foot), two-masted schooner with a professional crew of two. The wind-powered sailing ship would then sail around the Irish coast. Each week one contestant was scheduled to quite literally &quot;walk the plank&quot; after being voted off the ship by TV viewers. The final surviving contestant was to be considered the winner and would receive €100,000.

The show was named after &quot;cabin fever&quot;, the claustrophobic reaction that takes place when a person or group is isolated and/or shut in a small space, with nothing to do, for an extended period.

==The ships==
&quot;The Cabin Fever&quot; was built in 1947 in France. It was heavily refurbished for the programme.

&quot;The Cabin Fever II&quot; was brought from Dartmouth. It was registered as the &quot;Johanna Lucretia&quot;.

==The contestants==
The contestants — six men and five women — were selected from among 6,724 applicants.
Placings:

#Elaine Power (30), Dunmore East, County Waterford
#Cat Sheridan (26), Midleton
#Fiona McGonnell (29), Cavan
#David Yaffe (29), Rathfarnham
#Andrew Fowler (27), Dublin
#Marie Walsh (45), Castleisland, County Kerry
#Lee Gooch (30), Letterkenny
#Ciara Dunne (23), Carlow
#Stevie Greene (43), Limerick
#Nuala Carey (36), Dublin
#Noel Hogan (27), Ennis &quot;(quit on July 3rd)&quot;

==The show==

===Disaster===
Disaster struck however two weeks into the broadcast when, on 13 June 2003, the ship ran aground off Tory Island, a small island off the north-west coast near County Donegal. All the 9 remaining contestants1 and two crew were rescued by the nearby Arranmore Lifeboat, but the wooden sailing ship broke up on the rocks. Ironically the accident was not filmed by the RTÉ film crew; they had left the ship some hours earlier to catch some sleep after 15 hours continuous filming. The incident was however filmed by a local man who happened to have been recording the schooner&#x27;s movements at the moment she ran aground. The Irish media made much tongue-in-cheek mention of the fact that the disaster occurred on Friday the 13th, a date often linked to supposed curses and disasters and also the fact that the ship&#x27;s name had been changed for the programme: sailing lore suggests that any ship which is renamed prior to setting sail will meet with disaster.

Stuart Switzer, a Coco Television Productions producer responsible for the programme said: “The back of the boat has broken. It is actually in two pieces, and the waves are knocking the planks and timber around. There is debris all over the water and all over the shore.”

===Aftermath===
RTÉ and the programme makers, Coco TV, announced that all money earned from phone-in votes in the previous week (and which, due to the disaster, would not now lead to some contestant leaving the ship on 16 June as planned), would be donated to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which supplies lifeboat coverage around the Irish coast.

RTÉ and Coco TV hired a second boat. The captain, Peter Culleton, was replaced and the show began again, though three of the original team declined to come back. They were replaced by two new contestants. The series was further hit when the boat experienced engine trouble and required a new gearbox but the problem was ultimately solved. Partly due to the controversies, the series regularly topped the TAM ratings on RTÉ.

===Reaction===
Barry Andrews, a politician from the then governing Fianna Fáil party, questioned &quot;the wisdom of sending out 11 people with no sailing experience with just two qualified sailors.&quot; He said the destruction of the ship &quot;shows that so-called reality television has gone too far, with people being asked to carry out challenges that are too dangerous.&quot;

===Report===
Almost two years later, in March 2005, a report on the ship&#x27;s sinking was published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The report stated that the schooner breached its operating licence and had no effective watchkeeping. It also found that the contestants were fatigued at the time of the accident.

==Footnotes==
1 One contestant of the original ten had already &quot;walked the plank&quot; the previous week.

<doc id="245535" wikidata="Q24323" url="?curid=245535" title="Seven Pillars of Wisdom">
<text>Seven Pillars of Wisdom is the autobiographical account of the experiences of British Army Colonel T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) while serving as a military advisor to Bedouin forces during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire of 1916 to 1918.

It was completed in February 1922, but first published in December 1926 originally published for the US market in 1927 as Revolt in the Desert and is the only version that was commercially released while he was alive. &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; (1935) is a longer form of the book at almost double the page count and released to the international market.

==Title==
The title comes from the Book of Proverbs: &quot;Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars&quot; () (King James Version). Before the First World War, Lawrence had begun work on a scholarly book about seven great cities of the Middle East, to be called &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. It was incomplete when war broke out and Lawrence stated that he destroyed the manuscript. He used his original title for the later work.

The book had to be rewritten three times, once following the loss of the manuscript on a train at Reading railway station. From &quot;Seven Pillars&quot;, &quot;... and then lost all but the Introduction and drafts of Books 9 and 10 at Reading Station, while changing trains. This was about Christmas, 1919.&quot; (p. 21)

&quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; is an autobiographical account of his experiences during the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918, when Lawrence was based in Wadi Rum in Jordan as a member of the British Forces. With the support of Emir Faisal and his tribesmen, he helped organise and carry out attacks on the Ottoman forces from Aqaba in the south to Damascus in the north. Many sites inside the Wadi Rum area have been named after Lawrence to attract tourists, although there is little or no evidence connecting him to any of these places, including the rock formations near the entrance now known as &quot;The Seven Pillars&quot;.

==Manuscripts and editions==
Lawrence kept extensive notes throughout the course of his involvement in the Revolt. He began work on a clean narrative in the first half of 1919 while in Paris for the Peace Conference and, later that summer, while back in Egypt. By December 1919, he had a fair draft of most of the ten books that make up the &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; but lost it (except for the introduction and final two books) when he misplaced his briefcase while changing trains at Reading railway station.
National newspapers alerted the public to the loss of the &quot;hero&#x27;s manuscript&quot;, but the draft was not recovered. Lawrence refers to this version as &quot;Text I&quot; and says that had it been published, it would have been some 250,000 words in length.

In early 1920, Lawrence set about the daunting task of rewriting as much as he could remember of the first version. Working from memory alone (he had destroyed many of his wartime notes upon completion of the corresponding parts of Text I), he was able to complete this &quot;Text II&quot;, 400,000 words long, in three months. Lawrence described this version as &quot;hopelessly bad&quot; in literary terms, but historically it was &quot;substantially complete and accurate&quot;. This manuscript, titled by Lawrence &quot;The Arab Revolt&quot;, is held by the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas with a letter from Lawrence&#x27;s brother authenticating it as the earliest surviving manuscript of what would become &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;.

With Text II in front of him, Lawrence began working on a polished version (&quot;Text III&quot;) in London, Jeddah, and Amman during 1921. Lawrence completed this text comprising 335,566 words in February 1922.

To eliminate any risk of losing the manuscript again, and to have copies that he could show privately to critics, he considered having the book typed out. However, he discovered that it would be cheaper to get the text typeset and printed on a proofing press at the &quot;Oxford Times&quot; printing works. Just eight copies were produced, of which six survive. In bibliographical terms the result was the first &quot;edition&quot; of &quot;Seven Pillars&quot; (because the text was reproduced on a printing press). In legal terms, however, these substitutes for a typescript were not &quot;published&quot;. Lawrence retained ownership of all the copies and chose who was allowed to read them. The proof-printing became known as the &quot;Oxford Text&quot; of &quot;Seven Pillars&quot;. As a text it is unsatisfactory because Lawrence could not afford to have the proof corrected. It therefore contains innumerable transcription errors, and in places lines and even whole paragraphs are missing. He made corrections by hand in five of the copies and had them bound. In 2001, the last time one of these rough printings came on to the market, it fetched almost $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) at auction. Instead of burning the manuscript, Lawrence presented it to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

By mid-1922, Lawrence was in a state of severe mental turmoil: the psychological after-effects of war were taking their toll, as were his exhaustion from the literary endeavours of the past three years, his disillusionment with the settlement given to his Arab comrades-in-arms, and the burdens of being in the public eye as a perceived &quot;national hero&quot;. It was at this time that he re-enlisted in the armed forces under an assumed name, for the most part in the Royal Air Force, as described in his book &quot;The Mint&quot; with the byline &quot;by 352087 A/c Ross&quot;, with a period in the Royal Tank Corps as &quot;Private Shaw&quot;. Concerned over his mental state and eager for his story to be read by a wider public, his friends persuaded him to produce an abridged version of &quot;Seven Pillars&quot;, to serve as both intellectual stimulation and a source of much-needed income. In his off-duty evenings, he set to trimming the 1922 text down to 250,597 words for a subscribers&#x27; edition.

In a chapter of the 1922 Oxford text not included in the subscriber&#x27;s edition, Lawrence expresses in a heartfelt tone his feeling of shame at how the revolt was betrayed by the colonial powers (France and United Kingdom) with the secret Sykes-Picot agreement for the partition of the Middle East. An extremely rare copy of the original manuscript, which includes the excluded chapter, was auctioned in England in 2022 at the starting price of £ 65,000. With Lawrence&#x27;s words: &quot;[That was] an Arab war waged and led by Arabs for an Arab aim in Arabia … a new nation, to restore a lost influence [and build] an inspired dream palace of their national thoughts&quot;.

The Subscribers&#x27; Edition—in a limited print run of about 200 copies, each with a unique, sumptuous, hand-crafted binding—was published in late 1926, with the subtitle &quot;A Triumph&quot;. It was printed in London by Roy Manning Pike and Herbert John Hodgson, with illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, Paul Nash, Blair Hughes-Stanton and his wife Gertrude Hermes. Copies occasionally become available in the antiquarian trade and can easily command prices of up to US$100,000. Unfortunately for Lawrence, the edition cost £13,000 to produce compared with £6,300 raised by sale of 200 thirty guinea subscriptions.

The Subscribers&#x27; Edition was a little over 25% (84,669 words) shorter than the Oxford Text, but Lawrence did not abridge uniformly. The deletions from the early books are much less drastic than those of the later ones: for example, Book I lost 17% of its words and Book IV lost 21%, compared to 50% and 32% for Books VIII and IX. Critics differed in their opinions of the two editions: Robert Graves, E. M. Forster, and George Bernard Shaw preferred the 1922 text, although, from a legal standpoint, they appreciated the removal of certain passages that could have been considered libellous (or at least indiscreet), while Edward Garnett preferred the 1926 version.

Literary merits aside, however, producing the Subscribers&#x27; Edition had left Lawrence facing bankruptcy. He was forced to undertake an even more stringent pruning to produce a version for sale to the general public: this was the 1927 &quot;Revolt in the Desert,&quot; a work of some 130,000 words: &quot;An abridgement of an abridgement&quot;, remarked Shaw, not without disdain. Nevertheless, it received wide acclaim by the public and critics alike, the vast majority of whom had never seen or read the less-abridged Subscribers&#x27; Edition.

After the 1926 release of the Subscribers&#x27; Edition, Lawrence stated that no further issue of &quot;Seven Pillars&quot; would be made during his lifetime. Lawrence was killed in a motorcycle accident in May 1935, at age 46; within weeks of his death, the 1926 abridgement, as well as the first unabridged US edition by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, Inc., were released to the general public. The Doubleday edition was first released in a limited run of 750 copies, with a standard run released afterward. An unabridged edition was not published again until 1997, when the unabridged Oxford Text of 1922 appeared as a &quot;best text&quot; edited by Jeremy Wilson from the manuscript in the Bodleian Library, alongside Lawrence&#x27;s amended copy of the 1922 proof printing. Wilson made some further minor amendments in a new edition published in 2003.

==Critical comments==

The diplomat and academic Charles Hill has called &quot;Seven Pillars&quot; &quot;a novel traveling under the cover of autobiography&quot;, capturing Lawrence&#x27;s highly personal version of the historical events described in the book.

An advertisement for the 1935 edition quotes Winston Churchill as saying, &quot;It ranks with the greatest books ever written in the English language. As a narrative of war and adventure it is unsurpassable.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The book was adapted into the film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1963.

&quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; is a song by power metal group Sabaton about Lawrence, released in July 2019 on the album &quot;The Great War&quot;.

In Tony Parsons’ novel, &quot;The Murder Bag&quot; (2014), the &quot;Seven Pillars&quot; is referenced as part of the curriculum at Potters Field school, and has a formative influence on a group of former pupils.

<doc id="245536" wikidata="Q15528164" url="?curid=245536" title="James Maxwell (actor)">
<text>James Maxwell (23 March 1929 – 18 August 1995) was an American-British actor, theatre director and writer, particularly associated with the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester.

==Early life==
Maxwell was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States, but spent most of his career in the United Kingdom and died in London. He came to Britain at the age of 20 to train at the Old Vic theatre school. While there he met fellow students Casper Wrede and Richard Negri (co-founders of the Royal Exchange 25 years later).

==Work in the theatre==
After seasons at the Bristol Old Vic and the Piccolo Theatre in Manchester, Maxwell started to collaborate with the directors Michael Elliott and Casper Wrede, initially with the 59 Theatre Company. He translated Georg Büchner&#x27;s &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (original title: &quot;Dantons Tod&quot;) for the opening production at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Elliott and Wrede went on to run the Old Vic company and Maxwell joined them to act in several of the productions including &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;.

The group then joined with Braham Murray in Manchester to form the 69 Theatre Company. Maxwell adapted &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;; directed by Elliott and starring Vanessa Redgrave it was subsequently televised. He acted in many productions for the company including Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; in 1969 and Thomas More in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; in 1975. He also directed &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; with Tom Courtenay, Jenny Agutter and Brian Cox in 1973.

Based upon the success of this collaboration the group started to look for a permanent theatre in Manchester and eventually a new theatre was built inside the disused Royal Exchange with Maxwell as one of the founding artistic directors. He appeared in both the opening productions: Kleist&#x27;s &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot; (original title: &quot;Der Prinz von Homburg&quot;) and Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; and remained an artistic director until his death in 1995. As well as acting in many productions over the course of 20 years, he adapted several novels including &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot;. He also directed over 20 productions. As Braham Murray recalled. &quot;As an artist he was multi-talented and practised each of his skills with discretion. As a writer, he translated many works; as a director he was particularly skillful at comedy. He loved to make people laugh, but it was as an actor that he would want to be remembered.&quot;

==Work in television and film==
Although the theatre was always Maxwell&#x27;s first love, he appeared in television and film. His best-known television role was as King Henry VII in a BBC2 drama series, &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot;, but it did not have the same level of success as &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970), which was its predecessor drama. His other television credits include a prominent role in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Underworld&quot; (1978). He appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; in the 1967 episode &quot;The Superlative Seven&quot; as Jason Wade, and also appeared as Osmond in a television serial of Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1968), &quot;Frontier&quot; (1968), &quot;Doomwatch: The Iron Doctor&quot; (1971),&quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;. He played General-Major von Wittke in an episode of &quot;Enemy at the Door&quot; titled &quot;Treason&quot; (ep. 10, season 1, aired March 25, 1978).

He was also seen in the films &quot;Private Potter&quot; (1962), &quot;The Evil of Frankenstein&quot; (1964), &quot;Otley&quot; (1968) and &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; (1970). The first and last of these directed by his friend and colleague Casper Wrede.

==Personal life==
Maxwell married the actress Avril Elgar in 1952 and the couple had two sons. They met at the Old Vic theatre school and she appeared in many of Maxwell&#x27;s productions. He died in 1995.

Maxwell was referenced in the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester episode of &quot;Most Haunted&quot; (S8,07) when psychic medium David Wells allegedly received a message from Maxwell&#x27;s spirit. His career was touched upon as a founding member of the theatre.

<doc id="245552" wikidata="Q1054475" url="?curid=245552" title="Gaussian function">
<text>In mathematics, a Gaussian function, often simply referred to as a Gaussian, is a function of the base form
formula_1
and with parametric extension
formula_2
for arbitrary real constants , and non-zero . It is named after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The graph of a Gaussian is a characteristic symmetric &quot;bell curve&quot; shape. The parameter is the height of the curve&#x27;s peak, is the position of the center of the peak, and (the standard deviation, sometimes called the Gaussian RMS width) controls the width of the &quot;bell&quot;.

Gaussian functions are often used to represent the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable with expected value and variance . In this case, the Gaussian is of the form

formula_3

Gaussian functions are widely used in statistics to describe the normal distributions, in signal processing to define Gaussian filters, in image processing where two-dimensional Gaussians are used for Gaussian blurs, and in mathematics to solve heat equations and diffusion equations and to define the Weierstrass transform. They are also abundantly used in quantum chemistry to form basis sets.

== Properties ==
Gaussian functions arise by composing the exponential function with a concave quadratic function:formula_4where
* formula_5
* formula_6
* formula_7
(Note: formula_8 in formula_9, not to be confused with formula_10)

The Gaussian functions are thus those functions whose logarithm is a concave quadratic function.

The parameter is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak according to

formula_11

The function may then be expressed in terms of the FWHM, represented by :
formula_12

Alternatively, the parameter can be interpreted by saying that the two inflection points of the function occur at .

The &quot;full width at tenth of maximum&quot; (FWTM) for a Gaussian could be of interest and is 
formula_13

Gaussian functions are analytic, and their limit as is 0 (for the above case of ).

Gaussian functions are among those functions that are elementary but lack elementary antiderivatives; the integral of the Gaussian function is the error function: 

formula_14

Nonetheless, their improper integrals over the whole real line can be evaluated exactly, using the Gaussian integral
formula_15
and one obtains
formula_16

This integral is 1 if and only if formula_17 (the normalizing constant), and in this case the Gaussian is the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable with expected value and variance :
formula_18

These Gaussians are plotted in the accompanying figure.

The product of two Gaussian functions is a Gaussian, and the convolution of two Gaussian functions is also a Gaussian, with variance being the sum of the original variances: formula_19. The product of two Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs), though, is not in general a Gaussian PDF.

The Fourier uncertainty principle becomes an equality if and only if (modulated) Gaussian functions are considered.

Taking the Fourier transform (unitary, angular-frequency convention) of a Gaussian function with parameters , and yields another Gaussian function, with parameters formula_20, and formula_21. So in particular the Gaussian functions with and formula_22 are kept fixed by the Fourier transform (they are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform with eigenvalue 1).

A physical realization is that of the diffraction pattern: for example, a photographic slide whose transmittance has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function.
The fact that the Gaussian function is an eigenfunction of the continuous Fourier transform allows us to derive the following interesting identity from the Poisson summation formula:
formula_23

==Integral of a Gaussian function==
The integral of an arbitrary Gaussian function isformula_24

An alternative form isformula_25
where &quot;f&quot; must be strictly positive for the integral to converge.

===Relation to standard Gaussian integral===

The integral
formula_26
for some real constants &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 can be calculated by putting it into the form of a Gaussian integral. First, the constant &quot;a&quot; can simply be factored out of the integral. Next, the variable of integration is changed from &quot;x&quot; to :
formula_27
and then to formula_28:
formula_29

Then, using the Gaussian integral identity
formula_30

we have
formula_31

== Two-dimensional Gaussian function ==

Base form:
formula_32

In two dimensions, the power to which &quot;e&quot; is raised in the Gaussian function is any negative-definite quadratic form. Consequently, the level sets of the Gaussian will always be ellipses.

A particular example of a two-dimensional Gaussian function is

formula_33

Here the coefficient &quot;A&quot; is the amplitude, &quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;0 is the center, and &quot;σ&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;&quot;y&quot; are the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; spreads of the blob. The figure on the right was created using &quot;A&quot; = 1, &quot;x&quot;0 = 0, &quot;y&quot;0 = 0, &quot;σ&quot;&quot;x&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;&quot;y&quot; = 1.

The volume under the Gaussian function is given by
formula_34

In general, a two-dimensional elliptical Gaussian function is expressed as
formula_35
where the matrix
formula_36
is positive-definite.

Using this formulation, the figure on the right can be created using , , , .

=== Meaning of parameters for the general equation ===
For the general form of the equation the coefficient &quot;A&quot; is the height of the peak and is the center of the blob.

If we setformula_37then we rotate the blob by a positive, counter-clockwise angle formula_38 (for negative, clockwise rotation, invert the signs in the &quot;b&quot; coefficient). 
To get back the coefficients formula_38, formula_40 and formula_41 from formula_42, formula_43 and formula_20 use

formula_45
Example rotations of Gaussian blobs can be seen in the following examples:

Using the following Octave code, one can easily see the effect of changing the parameters:
A = 1;
x0 = 0; y0 = 0;

sigma_X = 1;
sigma_Y = 2;

[X, Y] = meshgrid(-5:.1:5, -5:.1:5);

for theta = 0:pi/100:pi
 a = cos(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_X^2) + sin(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_Y^2);
 b = sin(2 * theta) / (4 * sigma_X^2) - sin(2 * theta) / (4 * sigma_Y^2);
 c = sin(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_X^2) + cos(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_Y^2);

 Z = A * exp(-(a * (X - x0).^2 + 2 * b * (X - x0) .* (Y - y0) + c * (Y - y0).^2));

 surf(X, Y, Z);

end
Such functions are often used in image processing and in computational models of visual system function—see the articles on scale space and affine shape adaptation.

Also see multivariate normal distribution.

=== Higher-order Gaussian or super-Gaussian function ===
A more general formulation of a Gaussian function with a flat-top and Gaussian fall-off can be taken by raising the content of the exponent to a power formula_46:
formula_47

This function is known as a super-Gaussian function and is often used for Gaussian beam formulation. This function may also be expressed in terms of the full width at half maximum (FWHM), represented by :
formula_48

In a two-dimensional formulation, a Gaussian function along formula_49 and formula_50 can be combined with potentially different formula_51 and formula_52 to form a rectangular Gaussian distribution:
formula_53
or an elliptical Gaussian distribution:
formula_54

== Multi-dimensional Gaussian function ==

In an formula_55-dimensional space a Gaussian function can be defined as
formula_56
where formula_57 is a column of formula_55 coordinates, formula_59 is a positive-definite formula_60 matrix, and formula_61 denotes matrix transposition.

The integral of this Gaussian function over the whole formula_55-dimensional space is given as
formula_63

It can be easily calculated by diagonalizing the matrix formula_59 and changing the integration variables to the eigenvectors of formula_59.

More generally a shifted Gaussian function is defined as
formula_66
where formula_67 is the shift vector and the matrix formula_59 can be assumed to be symmetric, formula_69, and positive-definite. The following integrals with this function can be calculated with the same technique:
formula_70
formula_71
formula_72
formula_73
where formula_74

== Estimation of parameters ==
A number of fields such as stellar photometry, Gaussian beam characterization, and emission/absorption line spectroscopy work with sampled Gaussian functions and need to accurately estimate the height, position, and width parameters of the function. There are three unknown parameters for a 1D Gaussian function (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) and five for a 2D Gaussian function formula_75. 

The most common method for estimating the Gaussian parameters is to take the logarithm of the data and fit a parabola to the resulting data set. While this provides a simple curve fitting procedure, the resulting algorithm may be biased by excessively weighting small data values, which can produce large errors in the profile estimate. One can partially compensate for this problem through weighted least squares estimation, reducing the weight of small data values, but this too can be biased by allowing the tail of the Gaussian to dominate the fit. In order to remove the bias, one can instead use an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure, in which the weights are updated at each iteration.
It is also possible to perform non-linear regression directly on the data, without involving the logarithmic data transformation; for more options, see probability distribution fitting.

=== Parameter precision ===

Once one has an algorithm for estimating the Gaussian function parameters, it is also important to know how precise those estimates are. Any least squares estimation algorithm can provide numerical estimates for the variance of each parameter (i.e., the variance of the estimated height, position, and width of the function). One can also use Cramér–Rao bound theory to obtain an analytical expression for the lower bound on the parameter variances, given certain assumptions about the data.
# The noise in the measured profile is either i.i.d. Gaussian, or the noise is Poisson-distributed.
# The spacing between each sampling (i.e. the distance between pixels measuring the data) is uniform.
# The peak is &quot;well-sampled&quot;, so that less than 10% of the area or volume under the peak (area if a 1D Gaussian, volume if a 2D Gaussian) lies outside the measurement region.
# The width of the peak is much larger than the distance between sample locations (i.e. the detector pixels must be at least 5 times smaller than the Gaussian FWHM).
When these assumptions are satisfied, the following covariance matrix K applies for the 1D profile parameters formula_42, formula_43, and formula_20 under i.i.d. Gaussian noise and under Poisson noise:
formula_79
where formula_80 is the width of the pixels used to sample the function, formula_81 is the quantum efficiency of the detector, and formula_82 indicates the standard deviation of the measurement noise. Thus, the individual variances for the parameters are, in the Gaussian noise case,
formula_83

and in the Poisson noise case,
formula_84

For the 2D profile parameters giving the amplitude formula_85, position formula_86, and width formula_87 of the profile, the following covariance matrices apply:

formula_88
where the individual parameter variances are given by the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.

== Discrete Gaussian ==
One may ask for a discrete analog to the Gaussian;
this is necessary in discrete applications, particularly digital signal processing. A simple answer is to sample the continuous Gaussian, yielding the sampled Gaussian kernel. However, this discrete function does not have the discrete analogs of the properties of the continuous function, and can lead to undesired effects, as described in the article scale space implementation.

An alternative approach is to use the discrete Gaussian kernel:
formula_89
where formula_90 denotes the modified Bessel functions of integer order.

This is the discrete analog of the continuous Gaussian in that it is the solution to the discrete diffusion equation (discrete space, continuous time), just as the continuous Gaussian is the solution to the continuous diffusion equation.

==Applications==
Gaussian functions appear in many contexts in the natural sciences, the social sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Some examples include:
* In statistics and probability theory, Gaussian functions appear as the density function of the normal distribution, which is a limiting probability distribution of complicated sums, according to the central limit theorem.
* Gaussian functions are the Green&#x27;s function for the (homogeneous and isotropic) diffusion equation (and to the heat equation, which is the same thing), a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of a mass-density under diffusion. Specifically, if the mass-density at time &quot;t&quot;=0 is given by a Dirac delta, which essentially means that the mass is initially concentrated in a single point, then the mass-distribution at time &quot;t&quot; will be given by a Gaussian function, with the parameter a being linearly related to 1/ and c being linearly related to ; this time-varying Gaussian is described by the heat kernel. More generally, if the initial mass-density is φ(&quot;x&quot;), then the mass-density at later times is obtained by taking the convolution of φ with a Gaussian function. The convolution of a function with a Gaussian is also known as a Weierstrass transform.
* A Gaussian function is the wave function of the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
* The molecular orbitals used in computational chemistry can be linear combinations of Gaussian functions called Gaussian orbitals (see also basis set (chemistry)).
* Mathematically, the derivatives of the Gaussian function can be represented using Hermite functions. For unit variance, the &quot;n&quot;-th derivative of the Gaussian is the Gaussian function itself multiplied by the &quot;n&quot;-th Hermite polynomial, up to scale.
* Consequently, Gaussian functions are also associated with the vacuum state in quantum field theory.
* Gaussian beams are used in optical systems, microwave systems and lasers.
* In scale space representation, Gaussian functions are used as smoothing kernels for generating multi-scale representations in computer vision and image processing. Specifically, derivatives of Gaussians (Hermite functions) are used as a basis for defining a large number of types of visual operations.
* Gaussian functions are used to define some types of artificial neural networks.
* In fluorescence microscopy a 2D Gaussian function is used to approximate the Airy disk, describing the intensity distribution produced by a point source.
* In signal processing they serve to define Gaussian filters, such as in image processing where 2D Gaussians are used for Gaussian blurs. In digital signal processing, one uses a discrete Gaussian kernel, which may be approximated by the Binomial coefficient or sampling a Gaussian.
* In geostatistics they have been used for understanding the variability between the patterns of a complex training image. They are used with kernel methods to cluster the patterns in the feature space.

<doc id="245558" wikidata="Q336122" url="?curid=245558" title="Lopburi province">
<text>Lopburi (, , ) is a province in the central region of Thailand. The province is divided into 11 administrative districts, and Mueang Lopburi district is the capital. With over 720,000 people, the province is Thailand&#x27;s 31st largest area and 35th most populous. There are eight neighboring provinces, Phetchabun, Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Ratchasima, Saraburi, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Ang Thong, Sing Buri, and Nakhon Sawan.

Lopburi is a significant province historically, where many historical structures, artifacts, and prehistoric settlements have been discovered. In the past, Lopburi was called by the name Lavo.The kingdom had been ruled by an absolute monarch.

==History==

Known as Lavo during much of its history, Lopburi probably dates to prehistoric times. The name Lavo originated from the capital city of Lavo kingdom, an ancient Mon kingdom of Dvaravati period (6th–11th century CE). The conquering Khmer would build many impressive temples in the city during its rule. Lopburi may even have liberated itself for a time, as it sent independent embassies to China in 1115 and 1155. In 1289 it sent another embassy to China, but soon became part of the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai and later Ayutthaya.

During the Ayutthaya period, King Ramathibodi I sent Phra Ramesuan (later King Ramesuan) as the Uparaja to reign in Lopburi. In 1666 King Narai the Great ordered a new palace built on the east bank of the Lopburi River and made Lopburi the second capital of the country, as Ayutthaya was threatened by the Dutch. After King Narai died, the city was almost abandoned and fell into ruin.

In 1856 King Mongkut of the Chakri dynasty ordered King Narai&#x27;s palace to be renovated. The city finally regained its importance in 1937, when Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram chose Lopburi to be the largest military base in Thailand and once was decide to be new capital city of Thailand after the end of World War II.

==Geography==
Lopburi is on the east side of the Chao Phraya River valley, between the Lopburi River and Pa Sak Rivers. Thirty percent of the area of the province, including most of Tha Wung district, the southwestern parts of Mueang Lopburi and Ban Mi districts are a very low alluvial plain. The other 70 percent is mixed plains and hills, with the Phetchabun Mountains forming the eastern boundary of the province towards the Khorat Plateau. The total forest area is or 14.8 percent of provincial area.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
There is one wildlife sanctuary in region 1 (Saraburi branch) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Sap Langka Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==Climate==
Lopburi province has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification category Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until May. Monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Climatic statistics: Its maximum temperature is 41.4 °C (106.5 °F) in April and the lowest temperature is 10.2 °C (50.4 °F) in December. The highest average temperature is 36.8 °C (98.2 °F) and the minimum average temperature is 20.6 °C (69.1 °F). Annual average rainfall is 1,125 millimeters with mean rainy days is 17.6 in September. Maximum daily rainfall is 203.4 millimeters in October.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows Vishnu in front of the Khmer temple Phra Prang Sam Yod.

The escutcheon of Lopburi shows Phra Narai and in the background Phra Prang Sam Yod, the &quot;Sanctuary with the Three Towers&quot;. It refers to King Narai who in 1664 fortified the city to be used as an alternative capital when Ayutthaya was threatened by a Dutch naval blockade.

The provincial tree as well as the provincial flower is the &quot;bullet wood&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is the Java barb (&quot;Barbonymus gonionotus&quot;).

The slogan of the province is &quot;National treasures of King Narai&#x27;s palace and Phra Kan Shrine, famous Prang Sam Yot, city of Din So Phong Marl, well-known Pa Sak Cholasit Dam and golden land of King Narai the Great.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is subdivided into 11 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 122 sub-districts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 1,126 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Lopburi Provincial Administrative Organization (&quot;&quot;) and 23 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Lopburi, Khao Sam Yot and Ban Mi have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 20 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 102 Subdistrict Administrative Organizations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Transportation==


===Rail===
Lopburi railway station is a station of the State Railway of Thailand&#x27;s Northern Line, the end of Bangkok&#x27;s suburban service.

===Roads===
The main road through Lobpuri is Highway 1 (Phahonyothin Road), which starts in Bangkok, and continues through Lopburi, Chai Nat, Nakhon Sawan, Kamphaeng Phet, Tak, Lampang, Chiang Rai, and the border with Burma at Mae Sai. Highway 311 leads west to Sing Buri, and Highway 3196 leads south-west to Ang Thong.

===Air===
Khok Kathiam Air Force Base is north of the town. It has no commercial flights.

== Health ==
Lopburi&#x27;s main hospital is King Narai Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Events and festivals==
*King Narai Reign Fair (งานแผ่นดินสมเด็จพระนารายณ์): Event held annually, it is considered the greatest fair of the province. The objective is to honour King Narai the Great, who used to live here. The highlight is that all Lopburi people are dressed in traditional Thai clothes throughout the province and there is a sound and light performance at the King Narai&#x27;s Palace in the evening. This fair is promoted by Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
*Monkey Buffet Festival (เทศกาลโต๊ะจีนลิง): Annually buffet held during November for herd of macaques that live at ancient Khmer temple, Phra Prang Sam Yot and nearby Phra Kan Shrine in the centre of province, which they are like a symbol of the province. It was first organized in the year 1989.
*Climbing Up Khao Wong Phra Chan Festival (ประเพณีขึ้นเขาวงพระจันทร์): Pilgrimage inscription by climbing up 3,790 steps of Khao Wong Phrachan (&quot;crescent moon hill&quot;), the province&#x27;s highest hill that located in Khok Samrong district for pay homage to replica of the Lord Buddha&#x27;s footprint and Buddha statues that enshrined on the top of the hill. This festival is usually held on the Chinese New Year period and has been very popular, especially from Thai people of Chinese descent.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>In mathematics, trigonometric integrals are a family of nonelementary integrals involving trigonometric functions.

== Sine integral ==
The different sine integral definitions are
formula_1
formula_2

Note that the integrand formula_3 is the sinc function, and also the zeroth spherical Bessel function.
Since is an even entire function (holomorphic over the entire complex plane), is entire, odd, and the integral in its definition can be taken along any path connecting the endpoints.

By definition, is the antiderivative of whose value is zero at , and is the antiderivative whose value is zero at . Their difference is given by the Dirichlet integral,
formula_4

In signal processing, the oscillations of the sine integral cause overshoot and ringing artifacts when using the sinc filter, and frequency domain ringing if using a truncated sinc filter as a low-pass filter.

Related is the Gibbs phenomenon: If the sine integral is considered as the convolution of the sinc function with the Heaviside step function, this corresponds to truncating the Fourier series, which is the cause of the Gibbs phenomenon.

== Cosine integral ==

The different cosine integral definitions are
formula_5

 is an even, entire function. For that reason, some texts define as the primary function, and derive in terms of 

formula_6
formula_7

formula_8
for formula_9 where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Some texts use instead of . The restriction on is to avoid a discontinuity (shown as the orange vs blue area on the left half of the plot above) that arises because of a branch cut in the standard logarithm function ().

 is the antiderivative of (which vanishes as formula_10). The two definitions are related by
formula_11

== Hyperbolic sine integral ==
The hyperbolic sine integral is defined as
formula_12

It is related to the ordinary sine integral by
formula_13

== Hyperbolic cosine integral ==
The hyperbolic cosine integral is

formula_14
where formula_15 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

It has the series expansion
formula_16

== Auxiliary functions ==
Trigonometric integrals can be understood in terms of the so-called &quot;auxiliary functions&quot;
formula_17
Using these functions, the trigonometric integrals may be re-expressed as 
(cf. Abramowitz &amp; Stegun, p. 232)
formula_18

== Nielsen&#x27;s spiral ==

The spiral formed by parametric plot of is known as Nielsen&#x27;s spiral.
formula_19
formula_20

The spiral is closely related to the Fresnel integrals and the Euler spiral. Nielsen&#x27;s spiral has applications in vision processing, road and track construction and other areas.

== Expansion ==
Various expansions can be used for evaluation of trigonometric integrals, depending on the range of the argument.

=== Asymptotic series (for large argument) ===
formula_21
formula_22

These series are asymptotic and divergent, although can be used for estimates and even precise evaluation at .

=== Convergent series ===
formula_23
formula_24

These series are convergent at any complex , although for , the series will converge slowly initially, requiring many terms for high precision.

=== Derivation of series expansion ===
From the Maclaurin series expansion of sine:
formula_25
formula_26
formula_27

== Relation with the exponential integral of imaginary argument ==
The function
formula_28
is called the exponential integral. It is closely related to and ,
formula_29

As each respective function is analytic except for the cut at negative values of the argument, the area of validity of the relation should be extended to (Outside this range, additional terms which are integer factors of appear in the expression.)

Cases of imaginary argument of the generalized integro-exponential function are
formula_30
which is the real part of
formula_31

Similarly
formula_32

== Efficient evaluation ==
Padé approximants of the convergent Taylor series provide an efficient way to evaluate the functions for small arguments. The following formulae, given by Rowe et al. (2015), are accurate to better than for ,
formula_33

The integrals may be evaluated indirectly via auxiliary functions formula_34 and formula_35, which are defined by

For formula_36 the Padé rational functions given below approximate formula_34 and formula_35 with error less than 10−16:

formula_39

<doc id="245564" wikidata="Q407733" url="?curid=245564" title="Nitromethane">
<text>Nitromethane, sometimes shortened to simply &quot;nitro&quot;, is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is the simplest organic nitro compound. It is a polar liquid commonly used as a solvent in a variety of industrial applications such as in extractions, as a reaction medium, and as a cleaning solvent. As an intermediate in organic synthesis, it is used widely in the manufacture of pesticides, explosives, fibers, and coatings. Nitromethane is used as a fuel additive in various motorsports and hobbies, e.g. Top Fuel drag racing and miniature internal combustion engines in radio control, control line and free flight model aircraft.

== Preparation ==
Nitromethane is produced industrially by combining propane and nitric acid in the gas phase at . This exothermic reaction produces the four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction involves free radicals, including the alkoxyl radicals of the type CH3CH2CH2O, which arise via homolysis of the corresponding nitrite ester. These alkoxy radicals are susceptible to C—C fragmentation reactions, which explains the formation of a mixture of products.

===Laboratory methods===
It can be prepared in other methods that are of instructional value. The reaction of sodium chloroacetate with sodium nitrite in aqueous solution produces this compound:
:ClCH2COONa + NaNO2 + H2O → CH3NO2 + NaCl + NaHCO3

==Uses==
The dominant use of the nitromethane is as a precursor reagent. A major derivative is chloropicrin (), a widely used pesticide. It condenses with formaldehyde (Henry reaction) to eventually give tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (&quot;tris&quot;), a widely used buffer and ingredient in alkyd resins.

===Solvent and stabilizer===
The major application is as a stabilizer in chlorinated solvents. As an organic solvent, nitromethane has an unusual combination of properties: highly polar (εr = 36 at 20 °C and μ = 3.5 Debye) but aprotic and weakly basic. This combination makes it useful for dissolving positively charged, strongly electrophilic species. It is a solvent for acrylate monomers, such as cyanoacrylates (more commonly known as &quot;super-glues&quot;).

===Fuel===
Although a minor application in terms of volume, nitromethane also is used as a fuel or fuel additive for sports and hobby. For some applications, it is mixed with methanol in racing cars, boats, and model engines.

Nitromethane is used as a fuel in motor racing, particularly drag racing, as well as for radio-controlled model power boats, cars, planes and helicopters. In this context, nitromethane is commonly referred to as &quot;nitro fuel&quot; or simply &quot;nitro&quot;, and is the principal ingredient for fuel used in the &quot;Top Fuel&quot; category of drag racing.

The oxygen content of nitromethane enables it to burn with much less atmospheric oxygen than conventional fuels. During nitromethane combustion, nitric oxide (NO) is one of the major emission products along with CO and HO. Nitric oxide contributes to air pollution, acid rain, and ozone layer depletion. Recent (2020) studies suggest the correct stoichiometric equation for the burning of nitromethane is:

:4 CH3NO2 + 5 O2 → 4 CO2 + 6 H2O + 4 NO

The amount of air required to burn of gasoline is , but only of air is required for 1 kg of nitromethane. Since an engine&#x27;s cylinder can only contain a limited amount of air on each stroke, 8.6 times as much nitromethane as gasoline can be burned in one stroke. Nitromethane, however, has a lower specific energy: gasoline provides about 42–44 MJ/kg, whereas nitromethane provides only 11.3 MJ/kg. This analysis indicates that nitromethane generates about 2.3 times the power of gasoline when combined with a given amount of oxygen.

Nitromethane can also be used as a monopropellant, i.e., a propellant that decomposes to release energy without added oxygen. It was first tested as rocket monopropellant in 1930s by fom Italian Rocket Society. There is a renewed interest in nitromethane as safer replacement of hydrazine monopropellant. The following equation describes this process:
:2 CH3NO2 → 2 CO + 2 H2O + H2 + N2
Nitromethane has a laminar combustion velocity of approximately 0.5 m/s, somewhat higher than gasoline, thus making it suitable for high-speed engines. It also has a somewhat higher flame temperature of about . The high heat of vaporization of 0.56 MJ/kg together with the high fuel flow provides significant cooling of the incoming charge (about twice that of methanol), resulting in reasonably low temperatures.

Nitromethane is usually used with rich air–fuel mixtures because it provides power even in the absence of atmospheric oxygen. When rich air–fuel mixtures are used, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are two of the combustion products. These gases often ignite, sometimes spectacularly, as the normally very rich mixtures of the still burning fuel exits the exhaust ports. Very rich mixtures are necessary to reduce the temperature of combustion chamber hot parts in order to control pre-ignition and subsequent detonation. Operational details depend on the particular mixture and engine characteristics.

A small amount of hydrazine blended in nitromethane can increase the power output even further. With nitromethane, hydrazine forms an explosive salt that is again a monopropellant. This unstable mixture poses a severe safety hazard. The National Hot Rod Association and Academy of Model Aeronautics do not permit its use in competitions.

In model aircraft and car glow fuel, the primary ingredient is generally methanol with some nitromethane (0% to 65%, but rarely over 30%, and 10–20% lubricants (usually castor oil and/or synthetic oil)). Even moderate amounts of nitromethane tend to increase the power created by the engine (as the limiting factor is often the air intake), making the engine easier to tune (adjust for the proper air/fuel ratio).

===Former uses===
It formerly was used in the explosives industry as a component in a binary explosive formulation with ammonium nitrate and in shaped charges, and it was used as a chemical stabilizer to prevent decomposition of various halogenated hydrocarbons.

===Other===
It can be used as an explosive, when gelled with several percent of gelling agent. This type of mixture is called PLX. Other mixtures include ANNM and ANNMAl – explosive mixtures of ammonium nitrate, nitromethane and aluminium powder.

YouTuber NileRed has posted a video on YouTube where he has demonstrated that if you burn nitromethane it gives off a very unusually colored flame. The flame actually appears to be black and white. As an observer it is very mesmerizing to see this in person. He has used methanol to start the fire in the mentioned video.

==Reactions==
===Acid-base properties===
Nitromethane is a relatively acidic carbon acid. It has a pKa of 17.2 in DMSO solution. This value indicates an aqueous pKa of about 11. It is so acidic because the anion admits an alternate, stabilizing resonance structure: 

The acid deprotonates only slowly. Protonation of the conjugate base O2NCH2−, which is nearly isosteric with nitrate, occurs initially at oxygen.

===Organic reactions===
In organic synthesis nitromethane is employed as a one carbon building block. Its acidity allows it to undergo deprotonation, enabling condensation reactions analogous to those of carbonyl compounds. Thus, under base catalysis, nitromethane adds to aldehydes in 1,2-addition in the nitroaldol reaction. Some important derivatives include the pesticides chloropicrin (Cl3CNO2), beta-nitrostyrene, and tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, ((HOCH2)3CNO2). Reduction of the latter gives tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, (HOCH2)3CNH2, better known as tris, a widely used buffer. In more specialized organic synthesis, nitromethane serves as a Michael donor, adding to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via 1,4-addition in the Michael reaction.

==Purification==
Nitromethane is a popular solvent in organic and electroanalytical chemistry. It can be purified by cooling below its freezing point, washing the solid with cold diethyl ether, followed by distillation.

==Safety==
Nitromethane has a modest acute toxicity. LD50 (oral, rats) is 1210±322 mg/kg.

Nitromethane is &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen&quot; according to a U.S. government report.

=== Explosive properties ===
Nitromethane was not known to be a high explosive until a railroad tank car loaded with it exploded on . After much testing, it was realized that nitromethane was a more energetic high explosive than TNT, although TNT has a higher velocity of detonation (VoD) and brisance. Both of these explosives are oxygen-poor, and some benefits are gained from mixing with an oxidizer, such as ammonium nitrate. Pure nitromethane is an insensitive explosive with a VoD of approximately , but even so inhibitors may be used to reduce the hazards. The tank car explosion was speculated to be due to adiabatic compression, a hazard common to all liquid explosives. This is when small entrained air bubbles compress and superheat with rapid rises in pressure. It was thought that an operator rapidly snapped shut a valve creating a &quot;hammer-lock&quot; pressure surge.

If mixed with ammonium nitrate, which is used as an oxidizer, it forms an explosive mixture known as ANNM.

Nitromethane is used as a model explosive, along with TNT. It has several advantages as a model explosive over TNT, namely its uniform density and lack of solid post-detonation species that complicate the determination of equation of state and further calculations.

Nitromethane reacts with solutions of sodium hydroxide or methoxide in alcohol to produce an insoluble salt of nitromethane. This substance is a sensitive explosive which reverts to nitromethane under acidic conditions and decomposes in water to form another explosive compound, sodium methazonate, which has a reddish-brown color:

:2 CH3NO2 + NaOH → HON=CHCH=NO2Na + 2 H2O

Nitromethane&#x27;s reaction with solid sodium hydroxide is hypergolic.

<doc id="245568" wikidata="Q319913" url="?curid=245568" title="Convex function">
<text>In mathematics, a real-valued function is called convex if the line segment between any two distinct points on the graph of the function lies above or on the graph between the two points. Equivalently, a function is convex if its &quot;epigraph&quot; (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. 
In simple terms, a convex function graph is shaped like a cup formula_1 (or a straight line like a linear function), while a concave function&#x27;s graph is shaped like a cap formula_2.

A twice-differentiable function of a single variable is convex if and only if its second derivative is nonnegative on its entire domain. Well-known examples of convex functions of a single variable include a linear function formula_3 (where formula_4 is a real number), a quadratic function formula_5 (formula_4 as a nonnegative real number) and an exponential function formula_7 (formula_4 as a nonnegative real number).

Convex functions play an important role in many areas of mathematics. They are especially important in the study of optimization problems where they are distinguished by a number of convenient properties. For instance, a strictly convex function on an open set has no more than one minimum. Even in infinite-dimensional spaces, under suitable additional hypotheses, convex functions continue to satisfy such properties and as a result, they are the most well-understood functionals in the calculus of variations. In probability theory, a convex function applied to the expected value of a random variable is always bounded above by the expected value of the convex function of the random variable. This result, known as Jensen&#x27;s inequality, can be used to deduce inequalities such as the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality and Hölder&#x27;s inequality.

==Definition==
Let formula_9 be a convex subset of a real vector space and let formula_10 be a function.

Then formula_11 is called if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

The second statement characterizing convex functions that are valued in the real line formula_12 is also the statement used to define that are valued in the extended real number line formula_13 where such a function formula_11 is allowed to take formula_15 as a value. The first statement is not used because it permits formula_16 to take formula_17 or formula_18 as a value, in which case, if formula_19 or formula_20 respectively, then formula_21 would be undefined (because the multiplications formula_22 and formula_23 are undefined). The sum formula_24 is also undefined so a convex extended real-valued function is typically only allowed to take exactly one of formula_25 and formula_26 as a value. 

The second statement can also be modified to get the definition of , where the latter is obtained by replacing formula_27 with the strict inequality formula_28 
Explicitly, the map formula_11 is called if and only if for all real formula_30 and all formula_31 such that formula_32:
formula_33

A strictly convex function formula_11 is a function that the straight line between any pair of points on the curve formula_11 is above the curve formula_11 except for the intersection points between the straight line and the curve. An example of a function which is convex but not strictly convex is formula_37. This function is not strictly convex because any two points sharing an x coordinate will have a straight line between them, while any two points NOT sharing an x coordinate will have a greater value of the function than the points between them.

The function formula_11 is said to be &#x27; (resp. &#x27;) if formula_39 (formula_11 multiplied by −1) is convex (resp. strictly convex).

==Alternative naming==
The term &quot;convex&quot; is often referred to as &quot;convex down&quot; or &quot;concave upward&quot;, and the term concave is often referred as &quot;concave down&quot; or &quot;convex upward&quot;. If the term &quot;convex&quot; is used without an &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; keyword, then it refers strictly to a cup shaped graph formula_1. As an example, Jensen&#x27;s inequality refers to an inequality involving a convex or convex-(down), function.

== Properties ==

Many properties of convex functions have the same simple formulation for functions of many variables as for functions of one variable. See below the properties for the case of many variables, as some of them are not listed for functions of one variable. 

=== Functions of one variable ===

* Suppose formula_11 is a function of one real variable defined on an interval, and let formula_43 (note that formula_44 is the slope of the purple line in the first drawing; the function formula_45 is symmetric in formula_46 means that formula_45 does not change by exchanging formula_48 and formula_49). formula_11 is convex if and only if formula_44 is monotonically non-decreasing in formula_52 for every fixed formula_49 (or vice versa). This characterization of convexity is quite useful to prove the following results.
* A convex function formula_11 of one real variable defined on some open interval formula_55 is continuous on formula_56 formula_11 admits left and right derivatives, and these are monotonically non-decreasing. In addition, the left derivative is left-continuous and the right-derivative is right-continuous. As a consequence, formula_11 is differentiable at all but at most countably many points, the set on which formula_11 is not differentiable can however still be dense. If formula_55 is closed, then formula_11 may fail to be continuous at the endpoints of formula_55 (an example is shown in the examples section).
* A differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its derivative is monotonically non-decreasing on that interval. If a function is differentiable and convex then it is also continuously differentiable.
* A differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its graph lies above all of its tangents: formula_63 for all formula_64 and formula_65 in the interval. 
* A twice differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its second derivative is non-negative there; this gives a practical test for convexity. Visually, a twice differentiable convex function &quot;curves up&quot;, without any bends the other way (inflection points). If its second derivative is positive at all points then the function is strictly convex, but the converse does not hold. For example, the second derivative of formula_66 is formula_67, which is zero for formula_68 but formula_69 is strictly convex.
**This property and the above property in terms of &quot;...its derivative is monotonically non-decreasing...&quot; are not equal since if formula_70 is non-negative on an interval formula_9 then formula_72 is monotonically non-decreasing on formula_9 while its converse is not true, for example, formula_72 is monotonically non-decreasing on formula_9 while its derivative formula_70 is not defined at some points on formula_9.
* If formula_11 is a convex function of one real variable, and formula_79, then formula_11 is superadditive on the positive reals, that is formula_81 for positive real numbers formula_82 and formula_83.
* A function formula_11 is midpoint convex on an interval formula_55 if for all formula_86 formula_87 This condition is only slightly weaker than convexity. For example, a real-valued Lebesgue measurable function that is midpoint-convex is convex: this is a theorem of Sierpiński. In particular, a continuous function that is midpoint convex will be convex.

=== Functions of several variables ===

* A function that is marginally convex in each individual variable is not necessarily (jointly) convex. For example, the function formula_88 is marginally linear, and thus marginally convex, in each variable, but not (jointly) convex.
* A function formula_89 valued in the extended real numbers formula_90 is convex if and only if its epigraph formula_91 is a convex set.
* A differentiable function formula_11 defined on a convex domain is convex if and only if formula_93 holds for all formula_94 in the domain.
* A twice differentiable function of several variables is convex on a convex set if and only if its Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives is positive semidefinite on the interior of the convex set.
* For a convex function formula_95 the sublevel sets formula_96 and formula_97 with formula_98 are convex sets. A function that satisfies this property is called a and may fail to be a convex function.
* Consequently, the set of global minimisers of a convex function formula_11 is a convex set: formula_100 - convex.
* Any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum. A convex function will have at most one global minimum.
* Jensen&#x27;s inequality applies to every convex function formula_11. If formula_9 is a random variable taking values in the domain of formula_95 then formula_104 where formula_105 denotes the mathematical expectation. Indeed, convex functions are exactly those that satisfies the hypothesis of Jensen&#x27;s inequality. 
* A first-order homogeneous function of two positive variables formula_64 and formula_107 (that is, a function satisfying formula_108 for all positive real formula_109) that is convex in one variable must be convex in the other variable.

==Operations that preserve convexity==

* formula_39 is concave if and only if formula_11 is convex.
* If formula_112 is any real number then formula_113 is convex if and only if formula_11 is convex.
* Nonnegative weighted sums:
**if formula_115 and formula_116 are all convex, then so is formula_117 In particular, the sum of two convex functions is convex.
**this property extends to infinite sums, integrals and expected values as well (provided that they exist).
* Elementwise maximum: let formula_118 be a collection of convex functions. Then formula_119 is convex. The domain of formula_120 is the collection of points where the expression is finite. Important special cases:
**If formula_116 are convex functions then so is formula_122
**Danskin&#x27;s theorem: If formula_123 is convex in formula_64 then formula_125 is convex in formula_64 even if formula_55 is not a convex set.
* Composition:
**If formula_11 and formula_129 are convex functions and formula_129 is non-decreasing over a univariate domain, then formula_131 is convex. For example, if formula_11 is convex, then so is formula_133 because formula_134 is convex and monotonically increasing.
**If formula_11 is concave and formula_129 is convex and non-increasing over a univariate domain, then formula_131 is convex.
**Convexity is invariant under affine maps: that is, if formula_11 is convex with domain formula_139, then so is formula_140, where formula_141 with domain formula_142
* Minimization: If formula_123 is convex in formula_144 then formula_145 is convex in formula_146 provided that formula_55 is a convex set and that formula_148
* If formula_11 is convex, then its perspective formula_150 with domain formula_151 is convex.
* Let formula_9 be a vector space. formula_153 is convex and satisfies formula_154 if and only if formula_155 for any formula_156 and any non-negative real numbers formula_157 that satisfy formula_158

==Strongly convex functions==

The concept of strong convexity extends and parametrizes the notion of strict convexity. Intuitively, a strongly-convex function is a function that grows as fast as a quadratic function. A strongly convex function is also strictly convex, but not vice versa. If a one-dimensional function formula_11 is twice continuously differentiable and the domain is the real line, then we can characterize it as follows: 
*formula_11 convex if and only if formula_161 for all formula_162
*formula_11 strictly convex if formula_164 for all formula_64 (note: this is sufficient, but not necessary).
*formula_11 strongly convex if and only if formula_167 for all formula_162

For example, let formula_11 be strictly convex, and suppose there is a sequence of points formula_170 such that formula_171. Even though formula_172, the function is not strongly convex because formula_173 will become arbitrarily small.

More generally, a differentiable function formula_11 is called strongly convex with parameter formula_175 if the following inequality holds for all points formula_94 in its domain:formula_177
or, more generally,
formula_178
where formula_179 is any inner product, and formula_180 is the corresponding norm. Some authors, such as refer to functions satisfying this inequality as elliptic functions.

An equivalent condition is the following:
formula_181

It is not necessary for a function to be differentiable in order to be strongly convex. A third definition for a strongly convex function, with parameter formula_182 is that, for all formula_94 in the domain and formula_184
formula_185

Notice that this definition approaches the definition for strict convexity as formula_186 and is identical to the definition of a convex function when formula_187 Despite this, functions exist that are strictly convex but are not strongly convex for any formula_175 (see example below).

If the function formula_11 is twice continuously differentiable, then it is strongly convex with parameter formula_190 if and only if formula_191 for all formula_64 in the domain, where formula_193 is the identity and formula_194 is the Hessian matrix, and the inequality formula_195 means that formula_196 is positive semi-definite. This is equivalent to requiring that the minimum eigenvalue of formula_197 be at least formula_190 for all formula_162 If the domain is just the real line, then formula_197 is just the second derivative formula_201 so the condition becomes formula_202. If formula_203 then this means the Hessian is positive semidefinite (or if the domain is the real line, it means that formula_161), which implies the function is convex, and perhaps strictly convex, but not strongly convex.

Assuming still that the function is twice continuously differentiable, one can show that the lower bound of formula_197 implies that it is strongly convex. Using Taylor&#x27;s Theorem there exists
formula_206
such that
formula_207
Then
formula_208
by the assumption about the eigenvalues, and hence we recover the second strong convexity equation above.

A function formula_11 is strongly convex with parameter &quot;m&quot; if and only if the function
formula_210
is convex.

A twice continuously differentiable function formula_11 on a compact domain formula_9 that satisfies formula_213 for all formula_214 is strongly convex. The proof of this statement follows from the extreme value theorem, which states that a continuous function on a compact set has a maximum and minimum.

Strongly convex functions are in general easier to work with than convex or strictly convex functions, since they are a smaller class. Like strictly convex functions, strongly convex functions have unique minima on compact sets.

=== Properties of strongly-convex functions ===
If &quot;f&quot; is a strongly-convex function with parameter &quot;m&quot;, then:

* For every real number &quot;r&quot;, the level set {&quot;x&quot; | &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;r&quot;} is compact.
* The function &quot;f&quot; has a unique global minimum on &quot;Rn&quot;.

== Uniformly convex functions ==
A uniformly convex function, with modulus formula_215, is a function formula_11 that, for all formula_94 in the domain and formula_218 satisfies
formula_219
where formula_215 is a function that is non-negative and vanishes only at 0. This is a generalization of the concept of strongly convex function; by taking formula_221 we recover the definition of strong convexity.

It is worth noting that some authors require the modulus formula_215 to be an increasing function, but this condition is not required by all authors.

==Examples==
===Functions of one variable===
* The function formula_223 has formula_224, so is a convex function. It is also strongly convex (and hence strictly convex too), with strong convexity constant 2.
* The function formula_225 has formula_226, so is a convex function. It is strictly convex, even though the second derivative is not strictly positive at all points. It is not strongly convex.
* The absolute value function formula_227 is convex (as reflected in the triangle inequality), even though it does not have a derivative at the point formula_228 It is not strictly convex.
* The function formula_229 for formula_230 is convex.
* The exponential function formula_231 is convex. It is also strictly convex, since formula_232, but it is not strongly convex since the second derivative can be arbitrarily close to zero. More generally, the function formula_233 is logarithmically convex if formula_11 is a convex function. The term &quot;superconvex&quot; is sometimes used instead.
* The function formula_11 with domain [0,1] defined by formula_236 for formula_237 is convex; it is continuous on the open interval formula_238 but not continuous at 0 and 1.
* The function formula_239 has second derivative formula_240; thus it is convex on the set where formula_241 and concave on the set where formula_242
* Examples of functions that are monotonically increasing but not convex include formula_243 and formula_244.
* Examples of functions that are convex but not monotonically increasing include formula_245 and formula_246.
* The function formula_247 has formula_248 which is greater than 0 if formula_249 so formula_250 is convex on the interval formula_251. It is concave on the interval formula_252.
* The function formula_253 with formula_254, is convex on the interval formula_251 and convex on the interval formula_252, but not convex on the interval formula_257, because of the singularity at formula_228

===Functions of &quot;n&quot; variables===
* LogSumExp function, also called softmax function, is a convex function. 
*The function formula_259 on the domain of positive-definite matrices is convex.
* Every real-valued linear transformation is convex but not strictly convex, since if formula_11 is linear, then formula_261. This statement also holds if we replace &quot;convex&quot; by &quot;concave&quot;.
* Every real-valued affine function, that is, each function of the form formula_262 is simultaneously convex and concave.
* Every norm is a convex function, by the triangle inequality and positive homogeneity.
* The spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix is a convex function of its diagonal elements.

<doc id="245579" wikidata="Q5666876" url="?curid=245579" title="Harry Allen (executioner)">
<text>Harold Bernard Allen (5 November 1911 – 14 August 1992) was one of Britain&#x27;s last official executioners, officiating between 1941 and 1964. He was chief executioner at 41 executions and acted as assistant executioner at 53 others, at various prisons in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and Cyprus. He acted as assistant executioner for 14 years, mostly to Albert Pierrepoint from 1941 to 1955.

In October 1955 Allen was appointed as Chief Executioner alongside Pierrepoint, although he did not execute anyone in this role until 10 May 1956, when he hanged two EOKA members in Cyprus. Pierrepoint was no longer available because he had resigned in February 1956. Allen&#x27;s most controversial hanging came in April 1962, when James Hanratty was hanged for murder, despite efforts to clear his name. Hanratty was proven guilty in 2002 by DNA. Allen also assisted in the 1953 execution of Derek Bentley, who was posthumously pardoned. He performed one of the last two executions in Britain, in August 1964.

==Early life==
Born in Denaby Main, near Conisbrough in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 5 November 1911, Allen was brought up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and was educated at St Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic School in Burlington Street, Ashton. His first job was in the Transport Department at Park Bridge Iron Works, before he became a bus driver with Ashton Corporation, a job he continued to hold after he became an assistant hangman in 1941.

==Career as an executioner==
Allen applied for a job in the Prison Service in the 1930s but was turned down. He successfully applied to be put on the Home Office list of executioners and was often employed as an assistant executioner to Tom Pierrepoint, the uncle of Albert Pierrepoint. As a preliminary step, he witnessed his first execution at the age of 29 – that of William Cooper – on 26 November 1940 at Bedford Prison, describing it as a &quot;very good, clean job, not as gruesome as I expected&quot;.

Allen became a publican in Farnworth, Lancashire in the 1940s, combining his role as executioner with running the pub, which he ran until the early 1950s when he took over another pub, the Junction Inn, on Higher Lane in Whitefield.

In 1945, five German prisoners of war were hanged for murdering a fellow German soldier, Sergeant-Major Wolfgang Rosterg, whom they suspected of having betrayed their escape plan. It seems to have been this crime and ultimate execution that made the deepest impression on Allen. He wrote, &quot;It was a foul murder. They staged a mock trial, kicking the victim to death and dragging him by the neck to the toilet where they hung his lifeless body on a waste pipe. These five prisoners are the most callous men I have ever met so far but I blame the Nazi doctrine for that. It must be a terrible creed.&quot; A 21-year-old, Erich Palme-König, was the first of the soldiers to be hanged at Pentonville Prison, swearing allegiance to the last to Nazi Germany.

On 28 January 1953, Allen assisted at the controversial execution of Derek Bentley, who was hanged for a murder committed by a friend and accomplice during an attempted robbery, and for which Bentley received a posthumous pardon 45 years later. Contrary to some accounts, Allen was not present at the execution of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in the UK, in 1955: the assistant to Albert Pierrepoint on that occasion was Royston Rickard.

Following the resignation of Albert Pierrepoint and the death of Stephen Wade in 1956, Allen and Robert Leslie Stewart jointly became Chief Executioners. However, the Homicide Act 1957 reduced the number of condemned criminals by 75%, from an average of 15 a year in the early 1950s to about four a year in the late 1950s. As Chief Executioner, on 11 July 1958 Allen hanged American-born Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel at Barlinnie prison, Glasgow. He also hanged Guenther Podola on 5 November 1959, a German-born petty thief, and the last man to be hanged in the UK for killing a police officer.

His most controversial case was that of James Hanratty, hanged on 4 April 1962 at Bedford Prison for the &quot;A6 murder&quot; case. Efforts to clear Hanratty&#x27;s name continued until 2001, when DNA testing matched Hanratty to the crime scene.

Allen performed the last execution in Northern Ireland in December 1961, when he hanged Robert McGladdery at Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast. He also performed the last hanging in Scotland, when Henry Burnett was hanged at Craiginches Prison in Aberdeen on 15 August 1963 for the murder of Thomas Guyan. He hanged Russell Pascoe, one of the third-last prisoners to be hanged in a British prison, at Bristol&#x27;s Horfield Prison on 17 December in the same year. He also performed one of the two final executions in the UK, when at 8.00 am on 13 August 1964 Gwynne Owen Evans was hanged at Strangeways Prison in Manchester for the murder of John Alan West. This occurred simultaneously with the execution of Evans&#x27;s accomplice Peter Anthony Allen, who was hanged at Walton Gaol in Liverpool by Robert Leslie Stewart.

Allen always wore a bow tie during executions as a sign of respect. Of his job, Allen said, &quot;I never felt a moment&#x27;s remorse and always slept peacefully on the nights before and after a hanging.&quot;

A second man also answering to the name &quot;Harry Allen&quot;, Herbert Allen, an ice cream salesman from the West Midlands, was also on the official list of executioners for a period in the early 1950s, having graduated from the same training group as Syd Dernley. The two Harry Allens are known to have worked together as assistants on at least two double hangings.

==Personal life and diaries==
Allen&#x27;s first wife was Marjorie Clayton whom he married in 1933. She left him on the day that he was hanging Peter Manuel. Allen&#x27;s second wife was Doris Dyke, whom he married in 1963.

In October 2008 it was revealed that Allen had kept a diary which included a precise log of the prisoners and how they died. He recorded each prisoner&#x27;s age, weight, height and calculations for the length of rope needed to hang them. The diary and other belongings were sold at auction in Knutsford, Cheshire on behalf of his widow in November 2008 for £17,200.

Allen always publicly maintained that hanging was a &quot;swift and humane business&quot;. In his diaries he revealed that the execution of one prisoner, Peter Griffiths, who was convicted at Lancaster assizes of murdering a three-year-old child, June Anne Devaney, in the grounds of Queens Park Hospital in Blackburn on 15 May 1948, took 30 seconds, which would have been the time from Allen&#x27;s entering the condemned cell to the moment of the drop. Many other executions were faster than this, but death itself was always practically instantaneous. Griffiths was 22 years old, 5&#x27; 10&quot; tall, weighed 10st 8lbs, and was given a drop of 7 feet 6 inches on 15 November 1948 at Walton Gaol. Of another hanging he noted, &quot;Very good job, but should have had another two or three inches – very strong.&quot;

His granddaughter Fiona Allen is a comedian and actress, who rose to fame on the comedy sketch show &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;. She said of him, &quot;It&#x27;s as if I had two grandfathers. One was the sweet, lovely man who took me for walks on the beach, bought me sweets and toys and always had me laughing and giggling. The other one was the man employed to take lives for the Government. When I was a kid, everyone in the area knew what he did. I remember going round to my first boyfriend&#x27;s house for the first time and I tried to impress his dad by telling him I wanted to go on the stage. He looked up from his paper and said, &#x27;Going on the stage are you, lass? Well keep away from the trapdoor!.

==Later life==
Under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, capital punishment in Great Britain for murder was suspended, before finally being abolished in 1969 (it was abolished in 1973 in Northern Ireland). Although the death penalty remained for other crimes such as treason and piracy with violence, no further executions took place in the UK, although a working gallows was kept in service and regularly tested at Wandsworth Prison until 1998. It was dismantled when the death penalty for treason and piracy was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. He worked for a few years in security at an engineering firm in Blackburn.

Allen moved to Fleetwood with his wife Doris in 1977, to escape the continued publicity, and worked there as a cashier at Fleetwood Pier. He died on 14 August 1992, just a month after Albert Pierrepoint, who had died on 10 July in Southport.

<text>Robert Leslie Stewart (April 1918 – 30 April 1988), from Edinburgh, Scotland, was one of the last executioners in the United Kingdom, officiating between 1950 and 1964.

Brought up in Dundee Street in Edinburgh, 3 miles from Saughton Prison, Stewart completed the Prison Commissioners&#x27; Assistant Executioner training course in September 1950 at Pentonville Prison in London. His name first appeared on the Home Office list in 1950, with his first engagement occurring at Norwich on 19 July 1951, assisting Stephen Wade at the execution of Alfred Reynolds.

Stewart was active on the Home Office list between 1950 and the suspension of capital punishment for murder in 1965, carrying out 21 executions as assistant. On the 1957 printing of the list, Stewart and Harry Allen were both promoted to the role of executioner in the wake of the resignation of Albert Pierrepoint and the death of Wade, both in 1956. In this capacity, Stewart carried out six executions. He also assisted Harry Allen at the execution of Anthony Miller, the last teenager to be executed in the United Kingdom.

Stewart performed one of the last executions in the United Kingdom at 8 am on 13 August 1964, when he hanged Peter Anthony Allen at Walton Prison. Allen had been convicted of the murder of John Alan West; Allen&#x27;s accomplice, Gwynne Owen Evans, was hanged at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, at the same time by Harry Allen. Stewart also carried out the last execution in Wales, that of Vivian Teed at Swansea Prison in May 1958, for the murder of a postmaster during a robbery in Swansea.

Stewart died in South Africa in 1988 at the age of 70. He had emigrated there after the abolition of capital punishment to work as an airline engineer.

==Executions performed by Stewart as chief executioner==

* 6 May 1958 – Vivian Teed (HMP Swansea)
* 17 December 1958 – Brian Chandler (HMP Durham)
* 14 May 1959 – Michael George Tatum (HMP Winchester)
* 10 November 1960 – Norman Harris (HMP Pentonville, London)
* 17 December 1963 - Dennis Whitty (HMP Winchester)
* 13 August 1964 – Peter Anthony Allen (HMP Liverpool)

<text>In marketing, publicity is the public visibility or awareness for any product, service, person or organization. It may also refer to the movement of information from its source to the general public, often (but not always) via the media. The subjects of publicity include people of public recognition, goods and services, organizations, and works of art or entertainment.

A publicist is someone that carries out publicity, while public relations (PR) is the strategic management function that helps an organization establish and maintain communication with the public. This can be done internally, without the use of popular media. From a marketing perspective, publicity is one component of promotion and marketing. The other elements of the &quot;promotional mix&quot; are advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing and personal selling.

Organizations will sometimes organize events designed to attract media coverage, and subsequently, provide positive publicity; these events are known as &quot;publicity stunts&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Publicity&quot; originates from the French word . Publicity as a practice originates in the core of Paris, where shopping, tourism and the entertainment industry met commercialised print media and a burgeoning publishing industry. Among the urban society, scenes of consumption and new consumer identities were circulated through advertisement. La Maison Aubert shaped the emerging discipline of publicity. In early 19th century Paris, the advertisements and publicity campaigns for consumer items, such as cashmere shawls, and retailers such as perfumeries soon attracted regulation on flyposting.

19th century US companies included not only pro-sales messages in their publicity, but also explanations, demonstrations and exaggerations. Patent medicine and cosmetics manufacturers in the US frequently described or even showed consumers before and after the usage of the product. The Blair Manufacturing Company was among the US companies that advertised its products by comparing old-fashioned consumers who did not use the advertised product with the progressive customers who did. Before-after-changes became common in advertisement from 1910 onwards.
In the early 20th century, American Albert Lasker, developed the used of advertising for appealing to consumers&#x27; psychology.

The contemporary economist Thorstein Veblen criticised the relative benefit of publicity. He argued that vendibility is not utility, and that publicity had &quot;no traceable relation to any benefit which the community may derive.&quot; Veblen estimated how much the publicity campaigns of companies added to the price consumers were paying. He argued that the publicity overhead for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and cosmetics was more than half the retail price.

==Public relations==
Publicity is often referred to as the result of public relations, in terms of providing favourable information to media and any third party outlets; these may including bloggers, mainstream media, as well as new media forms such as podcasts. This is done to provide a message to consumers without having to pay for direct time or space. This in return creates awareness and achieves greater credibility. After the message has been distributed, the publicist in charge of the information will lose control of how the message is used and interpreted, in contrast to the way it works in advertising. According to Grunig, public relations is often reduced to publicity. He also states how publicity is a form of activity in which should be associated with the sales promotion effort of a company, in order to help aid advertising and personal salesmanship as well. Kent also stated that the doing of publicity can help attract attention whilst also supplying information regarding a specific organization or individual client and any event, activity or attribute associated with them.
The use of publicity is also known to be an important strategic element and promotional tool due to its effect of intentional exposure on a consumer. This helps publicity gain an advantage over other forms of marketing, such as advertising, often in order to boost credibility. Favourable publicity is also created through reputation management, in which organizations try strive to control via the web. Furthermore, despite the fact that publicity, both good or bad, can be beneficial for an organization, company or individual, much of it is paid for despite claims that publicity is often free.

Despite publicity being an influential benefit within the marketing sector, one disadvantage which highly affects publicity is the lack of ability in which publicity cannot be repeated, in comparison to paid advertising.

==Publicists==
A publicist is a person whose job is to generate and manage publicity for a company, product, public figure (especially a celebrity), or work such as a book, movie, or band. Though there are many aspects to a publicist&#x27;s job, their main function is to persuade the news media to report about their client in the most positive way possible. Publicists identify newsworthy aspects of products and personalities to offer to media outlets as possible reportage ideas. A variant of this practice which relies on linking a brand to a breaking news story has been dubbed &quot;newsjacking&quot;. Publicists are also responsible for shaping reportage about their clients in a timely manner that fits within a media outlet&#x27;s news cycle. They attempt to present a newsworthy story in a way that influences editorial coverage in a certain, usually positive, direction. This is what is generally referred to as spin.

A press agent, or flack, is a professional publicist who acts on behalf of his or her client on all matters involving public relations. Press agents are typically employed by public personalities and organizations such as performers and businesses. A press agent will provide information to the media such as upcoming public events, interview opportunities, and promotional dates, and will work with the media in getting in touch with an appropriate client or resource. Press agents are occasionally required to act as &quot;spin doctors, to put into the best light their clients&#x27; public actions. While press agents have traditionally worked with newspapers and television, they may also be conversant with newer media forms such as blogs and podcasts.

== Negativity ==

Publicity can also create a negative effect for those being publicized. One of the most important factors in relation to influencing a consumer&#x27;s buying decision is how a company, brand, or individual deals with negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in major loss of revenue or market shares within a business. It can also play a part in damaging a consumer&#x27;s perception of a brand or its products. Negative publicity&#x27;s high credibility and greater influence compared to other company-controlled communications play a part in the potential damage it may have on a corporate image. Crises involved with an organization may also result in negative publicity.

Furthermore, negative publicity affects everything from the evaluation of a brand and product to the present. Often, when awareness of a company, brand, or individual is high, negative publicity is deemed to hurt possible sales. In contrast, companies, brands, and individuals who are not widely known may use the negative publicity in order to increase brand awareness among the public.

The extensive range of media outlets, including both traditional and new media, provide opportunities for companies to market their products or services. This restricts or reduces the ability to manage negative publicity, as their message may be spread across media outlets. In order for organizations to try salvage any negative publicity surrounding their brand, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one solution which can help protect the image of a company or help reverse the damage. Companies must adopt the CSR approach early for it to be effective, or potential risks such as falsified intentions may develop within a consumer&#x27;s perception.

Despite the damaging effect negative publicity may cause, negative publicity may not always have the expected effect. There is a possibility that negative publicity may in fact gain more attention as opposed to positive publicity. Regardless of the nature of negative publicity and its ability to turn most people away, any slight hint of negative publicity can in fact build interest amongst the consumer. As stated by Monga &amp; John, negative publicity is not always harmful, and consumers whom identify a brand with strong attitudes are highly unlikely to be affected by the negative publicity formed.

<text>A digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM, often pronounced &quot;DEE-slam&quot;) is a network device, often located in telephone exchanges, that connects multiple customer digital subscriber line (DSL) interfaces to a high-speed digital communications channel using multiplexing techniques. Its cable internet (DOCSIS) counterpart is the cable modem termination system.

==Path taken by data to DSLAM==

# Customer premises: DSL modem terminating the ADSL, SHDSL or VDSL circuit and providing a LAN or interface to a single computer or LAN segment.
# Local loop: the telephone company wires from a customer to the telephone exchange or to a serving area interface, often called the &quot;last mile&quot; (LM).
# Telephone exchange:
#* Main distribution frame (MDF): a wiring rack that connects outside subscriber lines with internal lines. It is used to connect public or private lines coming into the building to internal networks. At the telco, the MDF is generally in proximity to the cable vault and not far from the telephone switch.
#* xDSL filters: DSL filters are used in the telephone exchange to split voice from data signals. The voice signal can be routed to a plain old telephone service (POTS) provider, digital telephone exchange or left unused whilst the data signal is routed to the ISP DSLAM via the HDF (see next entry).
#* Handover distribution frame (HDF): a distribution frame that connects the last mile provider with the service provider&#x27;s DSLAM
#* DSLAM: a device for DSL service. The DSLAM port where the subscriber local loop is connected converts analog electrical signals to data traffic (upstream traffic for data upload) and data traffic to analog electrical signals (downstream for data download).

==Role of the DSLAM==

The DSLAM equipment collects the data from its many modem ports and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite &quot;signal&quot; via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, and/or Internet Protocol network, i.e., an IP-DSLAM using Packet Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence (PTM-TC) protocol(s) stack.

The aggregated traffic is then directed to a telco&#x27;s backbone switch, via an access network (AN), also called a Network Service Provider (NSP), at up to 10 Gbit/s data rates.

The DSLAM acts like a network switch since its functionality is at the link layer. Therefore, it cannot re-route traffic between multiple IP networks, only between ISP devices and end-user connection points. The DSLAM traffic is switched to a Broadband Remote Access Server where the end-user traffic is then routed across the ISP network to the Internet. Customer-premises equipment that interfaces well with the DSLAM to which it is connected may take advantage of enhanced telephone voice and data line signaling features and the bandwidth monitoring and compensation capabilities it supports.

A DSLAM may or may not be located in the telephone exchange, and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface, sometimes in conjunction with a digital loop carrier. DSLAMs are also used by hotels, lodges, residential neighborhoods, and other businesses operating their own private telephone exchange.

In addition to being a data switch and multiplexer, a DSLAM is also a large collection of modems. Each modem on the aggregation card communicates with a single subscriber&#x27;s DSL modem. This modem functionality is integrated into the DSLAM itself instead of being done via individual external devices like 20th-century voiceband modems used for dial-up internet.

Like traditional voice-band modems, a DSLAM&#x27;s integrated DSL modems are usually able to probe the line and to adjust themselves to electronically or digitally compensate for forward echoes and other bandwidth-limiting factors in order to move data at the maximum possible connection rate.

This compensation capability also takes advantage of the better performance of &quot;balanced line&quot; DSL connections, providing capabilities for LAN segments longer than physically similar unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Ethernet connections, since the balanced line type is generally required for its hardware to function correctly. This is due to the nominal line impedance (measured in Ohms but comprising both resistance and inductance) of balanced lines being somewhat lower than that of UTP, thus supporting &#x27;weaker&#x27; signals (however the solid-state electronics required to construct such digital interfaces are more costly). Many early DSLAMs required a separate splitter rack to split POTS service from ADSL service, but newer DSLAMs can be connected directly to phone lines as they have built-in splitters.

==Bandwidth versus distance==
Balanced pair cable has higher attenuation at higher frequencies. Therefore, the longer the wire between DSLAM and subscriber, the slower the maximum possible data rate due to the lower frequencies being used to limit the total attenuation (or due to the higher number of errors at higher frequencies, effectively lowering the overall frequency/data rate). The following is a rough guide to the relation between wire distance (based on 0.40 mm copper and ADSL2+ technology) and maximum data rate. Local conditions may vary, especially beyond 2 km, often necessitating a closer DSLAM to bring acceptable bandwidths:
* 25 Mbit/s at 1,000 feet (~300 m)
* 24 Mbit/s at 2,000 feet (~600 m)
* 23 Mbit/s at 3,000 feet (~900 m)
* 22 Mbit/s at 4,000 feet (~1.2 km)
* 21 Mbit/s at 5,000 feet (~1.5 km)
* 19 Mbit/s at 6,000 feet (~1.8 km)
* 16 Mbit/s at 7,000 feet (~2.1 km)
* 8 Mbit/s at 10,000 feet (~3 km)
* 3 Mbit/s at 15,000 feet (4.5 km)
* 1.5 Mbit/s at 17,000 feet (~5.2 km)

==Hardware details==
Customers connect to the DSLAM through ADSL modems or DSL routers, which are connected to the PSTN network via typical unshielded twisted pair telephone lines. Each DSLAM has multiple aggregation cards, and each such card can have multiple ports to which the customers&#x27; lines are connected. Typically a single DSLAM aggregation card has 24 ports, but this number can vary with each manufacturer.

The most common DSLAMs are housed in a telco-grade chassis, which are supplied with (nominal) 48 volts DC. Hence a typical DSLAM setup may contain power converters, DSLAM chassis, aggregation cards, cabling, and upstream links.

On the upstream trunk (ISP) side many early DSLAMs used ATM—and this approach was standardized by the DSL Forum—with Gigabit Ethernet support appearing sometime later. Today, the most common upstream links in these DSLAMs use Gigabit Ethernet or multi-gigabit fiber optic links.

==IP-DSLAM==
IP-DSLAM stands for &quot;Internet Protocol Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer&quot;. User traffic is mostly IP based.

Traditional 20th century DSLAMs used Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to connect to upstream ATM routers/switches. The DSLAM simply extracted the ATM signals from the DSL signal, and passed the ATM signal to ATM routers, which then extract the IP traffic and pass it on to an IP router in an IP network. This division of work was thought to be sensible because DSL itself is based on ATM, and could theoretically carry data other than IP in that ATM stream. In contrast, an IP-DSLAM extracts the IP traffic in the DSLAM itself and passes it on to an IP router. The advantages of IP-DSLAM over a traditional ATM DSLAM are that the merged equipment is less expensive to make and operate and can offer a richer set of features.

<doc id="245586" wikidata="Q849009" url="?curid=245586" title="Protoplanet">
<text>A protoplanet is a large planetary embryo that originated within a protoplanetary disk and has undergone internal melting to produce a differentiated interior. Protoplanets are thought to form out of kilometer-sized planetesimals that gravitationally perturb each other&#x27;s orbits and collide, gradually coalescing into the dominant planets.

==The planetesimal hypothesis==
A planetesimal is an object formed from dust, rock, and other materials, measuring from meters to hundreds of kilometers in size. 
According to the Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis and the theories of Viktor Safronov, a protoplanetary disk of materials such as gas and dust would orbit a star early in the formation of a planetary system. The action of gravity on such materials form larger and larger chunks until some reach the size of planetesimals.

It is thought that the collisions of planetesimals created a few hundred larger planetary embryos. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, they collided with one another. The exact sequence whereby planetary embryos collided to assemble the planets is not known, but it is thought that initial collisions would have replaced the first &quot;generation&quot; of embryos with a second generation consisting of fewer but larger embryos. These in their turn would have collided to create a third generation of fewer but even larger embryos. Eventually, only a handful of embryos were left, which collided to complete the assembly of the planets proper.

Early protoplanets had more radioactive elements, the quantity of which has been reduced over time due to radioactive decay. Heating due to radioactivity, impact, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being planets. In melted zones their heavier elements sank to the center, whereas lighter elements rose to the surface. Such a process is known as planetary differentiation. The composition of some meteorites show that differentiation took place in some asteroids.

==Evidence in the Solar System - surviving remnant protoplanets==
In the case of the Solar System, it is thought that the collisions of planetesimals created a few hundred planetary embryos. Such embryos were similar to Ceres and Pluto with masses of about 1022 to 1023 kg and were a few thousand kilometers in diameter.

According to the giant impact hypothesis, the Moon formed from a colossal impact of a hypothetical protoplanet called Theia with Earth, early in the Solar System&#x27;s history.

In the inner Solar System, the three protoplanets to survive more-or-less intact are the asteroids Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta. Psyche is likely the survivor of a violent hit-and-run with another object that stripped off the outer, rocky layers of a protoplanet. The asteroid Metis may also have a similar origin history to that of Psyche. The asteroid Lutetia also has characteristics that resemble a protoplanet. Kuiper-belt dwarf planets have also been referred to as protoplanets. Because iron meteorites have been found on Earth, it is deemed likely that there once were other metal-cored protoplanets in the asteroid belt that since have been disrupted and that are the source of these meteorites.

==Extrasolar protoplanets - observed protoplanets==
In February 2013 astronomers made the first direct observation of a candidate protoplanet forming in a disk of gas and dust around a distant star, HD 100546. Subsequent observations suggest that several protoplanets may be present in the gas disk.

Another protoplanet, AB Aur b, may be in the earliest observed stage of formation for a gas giant. It is located in the gas disk of the star AB Aurigae. AB Aur b is among the largest exoplanets identified, and has a distant orbit, three times as far as Neptune is from the Earth&#x27;s sun. Observations of AB Aur b may challenge conventional thinking about how planets are formed. It was viewed by the Subaru Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Rings, gaps, spirals, dust concentrations and shadows in protoplanetary disks could be caused by protoplanets. These structures are not completely understood and are therefore not seen as a proof for the presence of a protoplanet. One new emerging way to study the effect of protoplanets on the disk are molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks in the form of gas velocity maps. HD 97048 b is the first protoplanet detected by disk kinematics in the form of a kink in the gas velocity map.
=== Unconfirmed protoplanets ===
The confident detection of protoplanets is difficult. Protoplanets usually exist in gas-rich protoplanetary disks. Such disks can produce over-densities by a process called disk fragmentation. Such fragments can be small enough to be unresolved and mimic the appearance of a protoplanet. A number of unconfirmed protoplanet candidates are known and some detections were later questioned.

<text>Astrosniks, commonly known as Sniks, are anthropomorphic space aliens created in 1975 by the German company Bullyland to market collectible toys, especially plastic figurines, designed with a retro-futuristic look.

==History==
Astrosniks were released as several sets of figurines in Germany in the 1970s, and were then licensed to about 50 manufacturers to produce memorabilia in 1983 and 1984. One prominent outlet for Astrosnik figurines during this era was McDonald&#x27;s, which included them in a long-running Happy Meal promotion. The toys were usually offered as consolation prizes on the game show &quot;Starcade&quot;.

The Snik figurines were reissued in 1999.

<doc id="245593" wikidata="Q281222" url="?curid=245593" title="ARX (operating system)">
<text>ARX was an unreleased Mach-like operating system written in Modula-2+ developed by Acorn Computers Ltd in the Acorn Research Centre (ARC) United Kingdom (UK) and later by Olivetti—which purchased Acorn—for Acorn&#x27;s new Archimedes personal computers based on the ARM architecture reduced instruction set computer (RISC) central processing unit (CPUs).

==Overview==
According to the project Application Manager Richard Cownie, during the project, while Acorn was developing the kernel, it used the C and Acorn Modula Execution Library (CAMEL) in the Acorn Extended Modula-2 (AEM2) compiler (ported from Modula-2 ETH Zurich (ETH) using Econet hardware). Though never released externally, CAMEL was ported to use on Sun Microsystems Unix computers. In an effort to port Sun&#x27;s workstations Sun NeWS to the Archimedes, David Chase developed a compiler based on AEM2 for the programming language Modula-3.

ARX was a preemptive multitasking, multithreading, multi-user operating system. Much of the OS ran in user mode and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into kernel mode to perform mutexes, which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARMv2a version of the ARM processor. It had support of a file system for optical (write once read many (WORM)) disks and featured a window system, a window toolkit (and a direct manipulation user interface (UI) editor) and an Interscript-based text editor, for enriched documents written in Interpress (a HTML precursor). The OS had to be fitted in a 512 KB read-only memory (ROM) ROM image. This suggests that ARX had a microkernel-type design.

It was not finished in time to be used in the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with an operating system named Arthur, later renamed RISC OS, derived from the earlier Machine Operating System (MOS) from Acorn&#x27;s earlier 8-bit BBC Micro range. Confusion persisted about the nature of ARX amongst the wider public and press, with some believing that ARX was Acorn&#x27;s own Unix variant, with this view being refined in time to accommodate ARX as Acorn&#x27;s own attempt to deliver a &quot;UNIX look-alike&quot; whose development had been abandoned in favour of a traditional Unix version for the Archimedes, which ultimately emerged as RISC iX.

The Acorn Research Centre was acquired by Olivetti.

<doc id="245595" wikidata="Q6937916" url="?curid=245595" title="Murder of John Alan West">
<text>The murder of John Alan West on 7 April 1964 was the crime which led to the last death sentences being carried out in the United Kingdom. West, a 53-year-old van driver for a laundry company, was beaten and stabbed to death by Gwynne Evans and Peter Allen, who had gone to rob him at his home in Seaton, Cumberland. Both murderers were unemployed, had a history of petty crime and were arrested and charged within two days of the crime. At trial, each blamed the other, but the jury found both men guilty, and both were sentenced to death. 

The use of capital punishment in the United Kingdom had been declining at the time, and public opinion was turning against the practice. As a result, the decision not to reprieve the two condemned came as a surprise. Both were executed at 8:00 am on 13 August 1964, in prisons in Manchester and Liverpool. Capital punishment for murder was abolished in the United Kingdom 15 months later.

==Gwynne Evans==

Gwynne Owen Evans (born John Robson Walby, 1 April 1940 – 13 August 1964) was born in Maryport, Cumberland, the third and eldest surviving child of Thomas and Hannah Walby. While attending a secondary modern school in Maryport, he occasionally attended Dovenby Hall Mental Colony in Cockermouth. On leaving school at 15 he worked as a page boy at a hotel in Carlisle and an engine cleaner for British Railways, in between periods of unemployment. He was given a supervision order in 1957 and sent to a hostel in Bristol; later that year he enlisted in the Border Regiment but was discharged in March 1958 as &quot;unfit under existing standards&quot;. He enlisted again in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in November 1958 and was discharged in February 1959 for the same reason.

He then took to using the name Owen Evans and worked briefly for British Railways before again trying the armed forces. The Royal Air Force accepted him in July 1959, but discharged him after four months as &quot;physically unfit for Air Force service&quot;. It was during a series of short-term jobs around Workington from September 1960 that Evans briefly worked for the Lakeland Laundry and came to know Jack West. He soon left and moved to Birmingham in October 1961 and there worked as a kitchen porter, driver and lift attendant. On 5 April 1963 as Gwyn Evans he was convicted by Carlisle magistrates of larceny of 5s cash, and obtaining 16s cash and a railway ticket by false pretences. He was fined £5 with four days&#x27; detention in default; he chose to serve the four days. He had stolen two half crowns from a friend while he was distracted, and he obtained a 16s loan from a police station by claiming to have lost his wallet at his mother&#x27;s funeral. In the following month Evans was given three months&#x27; imprisonment at Dudley for driving a motor vehicle without a licence, and using a driving licence with intent to deceive. Evans enlisted again, this time into the Lancastrian Brigade, in October 1963 but was discharged on 14 November 1963 when his criminal convictions and failure to disclose them came to light.

Evans then moved to Preston, where he lodged with Peter Allen and his wife. He worked for an agricultural trading society for about a month. On 21 January 1964 Evans committed his first crime with Allen, removing the lead flashing from an empty house. On 28 January the two broke open a cigarette machine and stole the contents; they stole a car and a van and used them in burglaries of several other premises. An incompetent attempt to cover up the van&#x27;s registration number led to their arrest and to fines of £10. From 5 March, Evans was employed by a dairy. On 17 March, having worked only two days, he was dismissed for absenteeism. The robbery of West was intended to provide enough money to pay the fines.

When he appeared in court, Evans spoke with a Welsh accent. He claimed that he had adopted the name Evans on finding out that his parents were German and that he had been born at Innsbruck.

==Peter Allen==
Peter Anthony Allen (4 April 1943 – 13 August 1964) was born in Wallasey, Cheshire, the second son of Richard Thomas Allen. After attending a secondary modern school in Wallasey, he too left at age 15. He obtained but lost two jobs within a month, dismissed for carelessness, but later found employment as a pipe-cleaner for three months. On 10 July 1958 he enlisted as a junior gunner in the Junior Leaders Regiment of the Royal Artillery, serving for 11 months before being discharged on 13 June 1959 as &quot;no longer required&quot;; he was given a good reference. For two years after leaving the army, Allen worked for two trucking companies; he was dismissed by the second in October 1961 when he was given a promotion and was said to have been unable to handle the responsibility. While he was working as a lorry driver, Allen received his first criminal conviction, for aiding and abetting the taking of a car in August 1960; he was given a conditional discharge.

On 11 November 1961, Allen married Mary, a cinema usherette; the couple had a Catholic wedding, and moved to Manchester. Later that month he found employment at a scrap-dealer, being dismissed in April 1962 for poor timekeeping. Six months&#x27; work in a dairy was followed by six months in a steel works, Allen having moved to Preston in April 1963. He found a job as a labourer with an agricultural trading society, but after two months he injured his back and was unable to work; he was not dismissed until January 1964. Later that month, he committed the various robbery offences with Evans. In February 1964 he was taken on by a Preston dairy but was dismissed for absenteeism after a month.

==Crime and arrest==
John West, known to his friends as Jack, was a bachelor who lived alone at 28 Kings Avenue, Seaton, Cumberland. Aged 53, he had worked for 34 years as a van driver for the Lakeland Laundry in Workington. After a normal working day, West had returned to his home just before 6.00 pm on Monday 6 April 1964. At about 3:00 the following morning his next-door neighbour was awoken by a noise in West&#x27;s house and, looking out of the window, observed a car disappearing down the street. The neighbour called the police, who found West dead from severe head injuries and a stab wound to the chest. In his house the police found a raincoat in the pockets of which was a medallion and Army Memo Form. The medallion was inscribed &quot;G.O. Evans, July, 1961&quot;, and the memo form had the name &quot;Miss Norma O&#x27;Brian&quot; on it, together with a Liverpool address. Liverpool Police traced a Norma O&#x27;Brien at the address; she was a 17-year-old Liverpool factory worker who told the police that in the autumn of 1963, while staying with her sister and brother-in-law in Preston, she had met a man called &quot;Ginger Owen Evans&quot;. She also confirmed that she had seen Evans wearing the medallion. She was driven up to Kendal, Westmorland, and identified the medallion.

Evans and Allen had stolen a car (a black 1959 Ford Prefect, registration NXC 771) to go to West&#x27;s house, and later abandoned it in a builders&#x27; yard in Ormskirk, Lancashire. Evans had asked a neighbour whether he could leave it there, and the neighbour thought his behaviour suspicious; she reported it to the police on the evening of Tuesday 7 April. The police found that the car had been stolen and matched the descriptions given in Seaton; with descriptions of the car and pictures of Evans, they traced its route back to Lancashire. The police also traced Evans, through his parents, as well as criminal and army records, to Allen&#x27;s address in Preston. At 1.00pm, on Wednesday, 8 April, less than 36 hours after West&#x27;s murder, the police turned up (in search of Evans) at Allen&#x27;s home in Clarendon Road, Preston. Allen agreed to go to the police station in Preston, and was then driven up to Kendal and then to Workington (where the murder squad were based). In questioning Allen claimed to have been home with his wife and &quot;Sandy Evans&quot; on the night of the murder.

He said his wife was visiting her mother in Manchester, and gave the address. A Bolton police officer went to the address to find only the mother there; he left telling her he would wait outside for Allen&#x27;s wife to return, and a few hours later she did return and went out immediately to the police car to tell the officer where to find Evans. Evans was soon found on a street corner at Phillips Park Road in Miles Platting and a search revealed West&#x27;s watch. Taken initially to the police station in Middleton, when told he was being arrested on suspicion of murder Evans admitted that he, together with Allen, Allen&#x27;s wife and two children, had gone to borrow money from West. Evans accused Allen of being solely responsible for the murder. He and Mrs Allen were then driven up to Workington.

==Interrogation==
Allen initially stood by his claim not to have done anything on the Monday night but changed his mind when he was told that his wife and Evans were in custody. He explained that Evans had suggested robbing West and had initially gone into West&#x27;s house on his own. Evans had then let Allen in, hoping that West would not notice, but West had come downstairs and so Allen had fought him. He said that Evans had given him an iron bar which he used to hit West. Allen then made a statement along these lines.

Evans claimed West had told him that he should see him if ever he was in Workington and needed money, so he had gone to ask for a loan. However, he said that Allen had forced his way into West&#x27;s house intent on robbery, and that Allen had been the only one to attack West. During questioning, Evans spontaneously mentioned that he knew nothing about a knife and did not have one. Until that point, the police had not revealed that West had been stabbed. Evans admitted to stealing West&#x27;s watch.

Mrs Allen&#x27;s statement supported her husband&#x27;s account that Evans had come out to invite him in. She reported that she had asked the two men what had happened in the house, and that Evans had said both had attacked West. At 1.15 am on Thursday 9 April, less than 48 hours after the murder, both Evans and Allen were charged.

==Trial==
Allen and Evans were committed for trial by Workington Magistrates after a two-day hearing. The trial was initially put down for Lancaster Assizes, but on application by the defence was transferred to Manchester Assizes. The joint trial before Mr Justice Ashworth began on 23 June; Joseph Cantley QC led the prosecution, with Allen defended by F. J. Nance and R. G. Hamilton, and Evans defended by Griffith Guthrie Jones QC. The indictment was for capital murder under the Homicide Act 1957, because West had been killed in the course of a theft (there was an additional charge of robbery with aggravation of two bank pass books and a gold watch). Allen claimed to have struck West only a few blows, and that Evans used the knife. Evans&#x27; defence was that the robbery had been suggested by Allen (if West refused a loan), and he had gone along with it only provided there was no violence.

The most important witness at the trial was Mrs Allen, who was called in her husband&#x27;s defence. She stuck to her statement that Evans had let Allen into West&#x27;s house, and that both men had been responsible for attacking West. She also testified that Evans had thrown the knife used to murder West out of the window of the car at Windermere, Westmorland, and that Evans had made an incriminatory remark apparently referring to stabbing West. In cross-examination she accepted that Evans had been more than a lodger to her; Evans&#x27; counsel then produced affectionate letters which she had written to Evans in Durham Prison while he was awaiting trial. The affectionate tone had suddenly ended when she heard Evans&#x27; account of the murder at the Magistrates&#x27; Court, and she had then written of her &quot;deep and bitter hatred&quot; of him. The judge later directed the jury to treat her evidence with caution; however the prosecution obtained permission to introduce her first statement which showed that her story had remained consistent.

In summing up, the judge asked the jury to decide whether the murder had been committed by one of the two men alone; in the latter case the other would be found guilty only of non-capital murder at the most. After considering the case for three hours the jury found both men equally guilty, and both were sentenced to &quot;suffer death in the manner authorised by law&quot;.

==Hangings==
Both men appealed, with the appeal heard by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Parker of Waddington, Mr Justice Winn and Mr Justice Widgery on 20 July. Judgment was given the following day dismissing the appeal. The date for the execution of the death sentence was set at 13 August. Under the law, the Home Secretary had to decide whether to advise the Queen to exercise the prerogative of mercy and commute the death sentence to life imprisonment; of 48 death sentences passed since the 1957 Act, 19 people had been reprieved. Only two executions had taken place in England in 1963 (those of Russell Pascoe and Dennis Whitty), and none so far in 1964. According to author Elwyn Jones, the police in the North-West expected a reprieve.

A recent reprieve for a notably brutal murderer from Lancashire may have led opinion in Preston to believe that a reprieve was likely for Allen and Evans, and a petition calling for both men to be executed was started (there was also a smaller petition calling for a reprieve). On 10 August, the Home Office sent out letters announcing that the Secretary of State had &quot;failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising Her Majesty to interfere with the due course of law&quot; in both cases.

Gwynne Owen Evans was hanged by the executioner Harry Allen at Manchester&#x27;s Strangeways Prison at 8:00 am on 13 August 1964, assisted by Royston Rickard. At the same time, Peter Allen was hanged at Liverpool&#x27;s Walton Prison by Robert Leslie Stewart, assisted by Harry Robinson. Those were the last two judicial executions of death sentences in Britain.

==Aftermath==
Mary Allen later married Billy Price, who had been one of her husband&#x27;s close friends. He adopted Allen&#x27;s sons Mark and Richard. Mary Allen died in 1980 aged 37.

According to medical reports released to the National Archives in mid-2017, Gwynne Evans had &#x27;serious psychological problems&#x27;, which, had his defence team entered a plea of diminished responsibility at his trial, could have led to his escaping being hanged.

<doc id="245597" wikidata="Q104148" url="?curid=245597" title="Vasily Smyslov">
<text>Vasily Vasilyevich Smyslov (; 24 March 1921 – 27 March 2010) was a Soviet and Russian chess grandmaster who was the seventh World Chess Champion from 1957 to 1958. He was a Candidate for the World Chess Championship on eight occasions (1948, 1950, 1953, 1956, 1959, 1965, 1983, and 1985). Smyslov twice tied for first place at the USSR Chess Championships (1949, 1955), and his total of 17 Chess Olympiad medals won is an all-time record. In five European Team Championships, Smyslov won ten gold medals.

Smyslov remained active and successful in competitive chess well after the age of sixty. Despite his failing eyesight, he remained active in the occasional composition of chess problems and studies until shortly before his death in 2010. Besides chess, he was an accomplished baritone singer.

== Early years ==
Smyslov was born in Moscow, into a Russian family. He first became interested in chess at the age of six. His father, Vasily Osipovich Smyslov, worked as an engineering technician and had represented the St. Petersburg Technical Institute in intercollegiate chess competitions. The senior Smyslov, who had also studied chess for a time under the tutelage of Mikhail Chigorin, became his son&#x27;s first teacher, and gave him a copy of Alexander Alekhine&#x27;s book &quot;My Best Games of Chess 1908–1923&quot;. The future world champion would later write that this book became his constant reference, and that &quot;...I was later to read everything that my father had in his library: Dufresne&#x27;s handbook, separate numbers of the Soviet chess magazines &quot;Chess&quot; and &quot;Chess Sheet&quot;, the text-books of Lasker and Capablanca, and the collections of games of Soviet and international tournaments. The games of the great Russian chess master M. I. Chigorin made an indelible impression on me; it was with interest that I read the various declarations on questions of strategy by A. I. Nimzovitch; I studied attentively the genius of prominent Soviet masters.&quot;

Smyslov&#x27;s competitive chess experiences began at the age of 14, when he started taking part in classification tournaments. In 1938, when he was 17, Smyslov won the USSR Junior Championship. That same year, he tied for 1st–2nd places in the Moscow City Championship, with 12½/17. However, Smyslov&#x27;s first attempt at adult competition outside his own city fell short; he placed 12th–13th in the Leningrad–Moscow International tournament of 1939 with 8/17 in an exceptionally strong field. In the Moscow Championship of 1939–40 Smyslov placed 2nd–3rd with 9/13.

== War years ==
In his first Soviet final, the 1940 USSR Chess Championship (Moscow, URS-ch12), he performed exceptionally well for 3rd place with 13/19, finishing ahead of the reigning champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This tournament was the strongest Soviet final up to that time, as it included several players, such as Paul Keres and Vladas Mikėnas, from countries annexed by the USSR following the Nazi–Soviet Pact of 1939.

The Soviet Federation held a further tournament of the top six from the 1940 event, and this was called the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, one of the strongest tournaments ever organized. The format saw each player meet his opponents four times. The players were Botvinnik, Keres, Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky, Igor Bondarevsky, and Andor Lilienthal. Smyslov scored 10/20 for third place, behind Botvinnik and Keres. This proved that Smyslov was of genuine world-class Grandmaster strength at age 20, a very rare achievement at that time.

World War II forced a halt to most international chess, but several tournaments involving Soviet players only were still organized. Smyslov was exempted from military service due to being severely nearsighted, and he won the 1942 Moscow Championship outright with a powerful 12/15. At Kuibyshev 1942, he placed second with 8/11. In a strong field at Sverdlovsk 1943, Smyslov tied for 3rd–4th places with 8/14. In the 1943–44 Moscow Championship, Smyslov tied for 3rd–4th with 11½/16. He finished second in the 1944 USSR Championship at Moscow (URS-ch13) with 10½/16. He emerged as champion from the 1944–45 Moscow Championship with 13/16. By this juncture, Smyslov had advanced into the group of the top three Soviet players, along with Botvinnik and Keres, who were playing in Nazi-occupied Europe during the war.

As the war ended, organized chess picked up again. But Smyslov&#x27;s form hit a serious slump in the immediate post-war period. In the 1945 USSR Championship at Moscow (URS-ch14), Smyslov was in the middle of the very powerful field with 8½/17; the winner was Botvinnik, with Boleslavsky and the new star David Bronstein occupying second and third places. At Tallinn 1945, Smyslov had the worst result of his career, scoring just 6½/15 in a not especially strong field. It was little better in the Moscow Championship of 1945–46, as he could only score 7½/15 for a tie of 7th–11th places, as Bronstein won. Then in the Moscow Championship of 1946, Smyslov scored just 8½/15, for a tie of 3rd–6th places, as Bronstein won again. During this period he scored just 31/62 in those four tournaments, for 50%.

Nevertheless, Smyslov&#x27;s earlier strong results secured him one of the five Soviet places in the first really strong post-war international tournament, at Groningen, Netherlands, in August 1946. This event, the Howard Staunton Memorial, was won by Botvinnik with 14½/19, half a point ahead of former World Champion Max Euwe. Smyslov finished third with 12½/19, and this confirmed his status as one of the world&#x27;s top players.

Once he was back playing in Soviet events, however, Smyslov found it tough going for a while. In the next Soviet Championship (URS-ch15, Leningrad 1947), he tied for 3rd–4th places with 12/19, as Keres won. At Pärnu 1947, Smyslov scored 8/13, tying for 4th–6th places, as Keres won again. At Warsaw 1947, Smyslov scored 6/9 to tie for 2nd–5th places; the winner was Svetozar Gligorić. In the Mikhail Chigorin Memorial tournament, Moscow 1947, Smyslov tied for 3rd–4th places, with 10/15, as Botvinnik won.

His results showed a consistent pattern of high finishes against strong company, but with virtually no tournament championships. Smyslov had never actually won an adult tournament (other than the Moscow City Championship) before he played in the 1948 World Championship Tournament.

== World title challenger ==
Smyslov was one of the five players selected to compete for the 1948 World Chess Championship tournament to determine who should succeed the late Alexander Alekhine as champion. His selection was questioned in some quarters, but this criticism was amply rebutted when he finished second behind Mikhail Botvinnik, with a score of 11/20.

With his second-place finish from the 1948 World Championship, Smyslov was admitted directly into the 1950 Budapest Candidates&#x27; tournament without needing to play in qualifying events. Smyslov scored 10/18 for third place, behind Bronstein and Boleslavsky, who tied for first place. Smyslov&#x27;s third place automatically qualified him into the next Candidates&#x27; tournament. He was awarded the International Grandmaster title in 1950 by FIDE on its inaugural list.

After winning the Candidates Tournament in Zürich 1953, with 18/28, two points ahead of Keres, Bronstein, and Samuel Reshevsky, Smyslov played a match with Botvinnik for the title the following year. Sited at Moscow, the match ended in a draw, after 24 games (seven wins each and ten draws), meaning that Botvinnik retained his title.

== World Champion ==

Smyslov again won the Candidates&#x27; Tournament at Amsterdam in 1956, this time by 1½ points. This qualified him for a second world championship match against Botvinnik in 1957. Assisted by trainers Vladimir Makogonov and Vladimir Simagin, Smyslov won the title, scoring 12½–9½. The following year, Botvinnik exercised his right to a rematch, and regained the title with a final score of 12½–10½. Smyslov later said his health suffered during the return match, as he came down with pneumonia, but he also acknowledged that Botvinnik had prepared very thoroughly. Over the course of the three World Championship matches, Smyslov had 18 wins to Botvinnik&#x27;s 17 (with 34 draws), yet was only champion for a year. Nonetheless, Smyslov wrote in his autobiographical games collection &quot;Smyslov&#x27;s Best Games&quot;, &quot;I have no reason to complain of my fate. I fulfilled my dream and became the seventh world champion in the history of chess.&quot;

== Later World Championships ==

Smyslov did not qualify for another World Championship, but continued to play in World Championship qualifying events. He was a Candidate in 1959, but finished fourth in the qualifying tournament held in Yugoslavia, which was won by the rising superstar Mikhail Tal. He missed out in 1962, but was back in 1964, following a first-place tie at the Amsterdam Interzonal, with 17/23. However, he lost his first-round match to Efim Geller.

In 1983, at the age of 62, he reached the Candidates&#x27; Final (the match to determine who plays the champion, in that case Anatoly Karpov), losing 8½–4½ at Vilnius 1984 to Garry Kasparov, who was 21 at the time, and who went on to beat Karpov to become world champion in 1985. He had beaten Zoltán Ribli 6½–4½ in the semifinal, but drew his quarter-final match against Robert Hübner 7–7, with the advancing player (Smyslov) determined only by the spin of a roulette wheel. His final Candidates&#x27; appearance was the Montpellier 1985 tournament, where he did not advance.

== Soviet Championships ==
Smyslov was a frequent competitor at the Soviet Championships and enjoyed some notable successes. In 1940, while still a teenager, he finished third behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. At the 13th Championship in 1944, he placed second behind Botvinnik and in 1947, shared third with Bondarevsky, finishing behind Keres and Boleslavsky.

He was a joint winner of the contest in 1949 and again in 1955 (with Bronstein and Geller respectively). Whilst the 1949 title was shared, the 1955 title was awarded to Geller after a play-off.

Much later in his career he showed that he could still mount a credible challenge; he took a share of third place in 1969 (behind Petrosian and Polugaevsky) and in 1971, was joint runner-up with Tal, behind Savon. He was ranked by FIDE as one of the top 15 players in the world from the late 1940s into the early 1980s, a stretch of almost 40 years.

== Post-war tournament record ==
Smyslov maintained an active tournament schedule throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, registering many top three finishes in some of the most prestigious tournaments of the period.

In 1950, he was second behind Kotov at Venice and in 1951, won the Chigorin Memorial, held in Leningrad. He shared third place with Botvinnik at Budapest (Maróczy Memorial) in 1952, behind Keres and Geller. In 1953, he won a training tournament in Gagra and finished third at Bucharest, behind Tolush and Petrosian. At the 1954–55 edition of the Hastings Congress, he shared first place with Keres. At Zagreb 1955, he was sole winner, two clear points ahead of the field. He continued his winning streak at Moscow&#x27;s Alekhine Memorial in 1956, a victory shared with his constant rival, Botvinnik. During this period, there were several triumphs in his city of birth, when he shared first place with Bronstein and Spassky at the inaugural edition of the Moscow Central Chess Club international tournament series (sometimes also referred as an Alekhine Memorial) in 1959, was a joint winner in both 1960 (with Kholmov) and 1961 (with Vasiukov), and won outright in 1963.

His good form continued throughout the 1960s. There were shares of second place at Dortmund 1961 (behind Taimanov) and at Mar del Plata 1962 (behind Polugaevsky). He traveled again to Hastings at the end of 1962, and scored third place behind Gligoric and Kotov. In 1963, he was second at Sochi (Chigorin Memorial) behind Polugaevsky. His visit to Havana&#x27;s Capablanca Memorial in 1964 resulted in a share of first with the East German, Uhlmann. He took outright first at the same tournament the following year. In 1966, there were victories at Mar del Plata and at the Rubinstein Memorial in Polanica Zdroj. In 1967, he was second (behind Fischer) at Monte Carlo, won at Moscow, and finished second (behind Stein) at the city&#x27;s Alekhine Memorial tournament. He placed third the same year at the Capablanca Memorial in Havana (behind Larsen and Taimanov) and finished third again at Palma de Mallorca 1967 and Monte Carlo 1968, the latter two events both being headed by Larsen and Botvinnik. This was also the year he repeated his previous success at Polanica Zdroj, finishing first outright. His next trip to Hastings also ended in triumph, as he took clear first at the 1968–69 edition. The 1960s drew to a close with victory at Monte Carlo 1969 (shared with Portisch) and a share of third place at Skopje 1969 (with Uhlmann and Kholmov, behind Hort and Matulović).

While less prolific than in previous decades, Smyslov played many strong tournaments in the 1970s and even into the 1980s and beyond. He was joint runner-up with Hort, Gligoric and Korchnoi at Rovinj/Zagreb 1970, behind Fischer. A winner at Amsterdam 1971, he came third at the Alekhine Memorial (Moscow) in the same year, behind Karpov and Stein. At Las Palmas 1972, he was second equal with Larsen, behind Portisch and in 1973, topped the Capablanca Memorial in Cienfuegos. First place followed at Reykjavík 1974; at the Venice tournament of the same year, he finished second behind Liberzon. Then followed a second place at the Alexander Memorial (Teesside) in 1975 (behind Geller), a first place at Szolnok (also 1975), and a multi-way share of second at the large Lone Pine Open of 1976 (Petrosian won). He finished third behind Romanishin and Tal at Leningrad in 1977, when all three eclipsed the efforts of then–world champion Anatoly Karpov. In 1978, he won at São Paulo and finished with a share of second at Buenos Aires, behind Andersson. As the 1970s ended, he took first place at Berlin 1979, this time shared with Csom.

Notable outcomes for 1980 included joint first places at San Miguel (with Browne, Panno, Jaime Emma) and at Copenhagen (the Politiken Cup, with Mikhalchishin). In the same year he finished second at Bar, behind Petrosian, and second at Baguio, behind Torre. At Moscow 1981, he joined Kasparov and Polugaevsky in second place, behind Karpov. A further Hastings visit in 1981–82 resulted in a share of second place, with Speelman, behind Kupreichik. He was first at Graz in 1984 and first equal at Copenhagen (Politiken Cup) 1986 with Chernin, Pigusov and Cserna. He played at Reggio Emilia over the New Year of 1986–87 and shared second spot with Hort, Chernin and Spassky, behind Ribli. At Hastings in 1988–89, he took a share of third with Gulko and Speelman, behind Short and Korchnoi.

Smyslov remained on FIDE&#x27;s top 100 list until he was 70 years old. His tournament appearances were fewer in the 1990s, but results included a share of first place at Buenos Aires 1990 and a share of second at Malmö (Sigeman) in 1997, behind Hellers.

== Team competition ==
 










Smyslov represented the Soviet Union a total of nine times at chess Olympiads, from 1952 to 1972 inclusive, excepting only 1962 and 1966. He contributed strongly to team gold medal wins on each occasion he played, winning a total of eight individual medals. His total of 17 Olympiad medals won, including team and individual medals, is an all-time Olympiad record, according to olimpbase.org.

At Helsinki 1952, he played second board, and won the individual gold medal with 10½/13. At Amsterdam 1954, he was again on second board, scored 9/12, and took the individual bronze medal. At Moscow 1956, he scored 8½/13 on second board, but failed to win a medal. At Munich 1958, he made 9½/13 on second board, good for the silver individual medal. At Leipzig 1960, he was dropped to first reserve, and made a great score of 11½/13, which won the gold medal.

After missing out on selection in 1962, he returned for Tel Aviv 1964, on third board, and won the gold medal with 11/13. He missed selection in 1966, but returned with a vengeance for Lugano 1968, and made a phenomenal 11/12 for another gold medal as second reserve. At Siegen 1970, he was first reserve, and scored 8/11 for the bronze medal. His final Olympiad was Skopje 1972, where at the age of 51 he played third board and scored 11/14, gaining the silver medal.

His overall Olympiad score is an imposing 90 points in 113 games (+69−2=42), for 79.6%. This performance is the fifth all-time best for players participating in at least four Olympiads. Smyslov also represented the USSR in five European Team Championships, and emerged with a perfect medals&#x27; record: he won five team gold medals and five board gold medals. His total score in these events was +19−1=15, for 75.7%. From olimpbase.org, here is his European teams&#x27; data.

* Vienna 1957: board 1, 3½/6 (+2−1=3), board and team gold medals;
* Oberhausen 1961: board 5, 8/9 (+7−0=2), board and team gold medals;
* Hamburg 1965: board 4, 6/9 (+3−0=6), board and team gold medals;
* Kapfenberg 1970: board 5, 5/6 (+4−0=2), board and team gold medals;
* Bath, Somerset 1973: board 6, 4/5 (+3−0=2), board and team gold medals.

Smyslov played for the USSR in both the 1970 and 1984 matches against teams representing the Rest of the World. He was on board six at Belgrade in 1970, and on board four at London in 1984, with the Soviets winning both matches.

== Final years ==

In 1991, Smyslov won the inaugural World Senior Chess Championship. With a FIDE rating still around 2400 as of the year 2000, the 80-year old grandmaster participated in what was to be his final tournament, the Klompendans Veterans Vs. Ladies Tournament in Amsterdam. The highlight of the match was his rout of Zsofia Polgar, leaving the all-time record between the two as +5–1=3. Some of the matches were adjourned early as draws due to his failing eyesight, and Smyslov officially retired from competitive play after this tournament. His Elo rating after this event was 2494.

Smyslov died of congestive heart failure in a Moscow hospital on the morning of 27 March 2010, three days after his 89th birthday. Reports circulated that his final years were spent in near-poverty and that he could not afford badly-needed eye surgery. It was also reported that Smyslov and his wife Nadezhda mostly lived on income from renting their apartment and that no one checked on them or provided care.

== Chess style and legacy ==

Smyslov was known for his positional style, and, in particular, his precise handling of the endgame, but many of his games featured spectacular tactics as well. His opening repertoire was conventional for the 1950s–1960s era, featuring mainly the Ruy Lopez and English Opening as White, and the Sicilian Defense and Nimzo-Indian Defense as Black. He made enormous contributions to chess opening theory, including the English Opening, Grünfeld Defence, and the Sicilian Defence.

A variation of the Closed Ruy Lopez is named after him. The line runs 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6. In the Grünfeld Defence, the continuation 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qb3 dxc4 6.Qxc4 0-0 7.e4 Bg4 8.Be3 Nfd7 is known as the Smyslov Variation, and remains a major variation. Smyslov also successfully revived the Fianchetto Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 g6) in the 1970s. In the Slav Defence, the sideline 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 dxc4 5.a4 Na6 is named the Smyslov Variation. Finally, a variation of the King&#x27;s Indian Defense is named after him, which proceeds with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Nf3 0-0 5.Bg5 d6 6.e3.

Stanley Kubrick named a character after him in his film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

== Opera singer ==
A baritone, Smyslov only decided upon a chess career after a failed audition with the Bolshoi Theatre in 1950. He occasionally gave recitals during chess tournaments, often accompanied by fellow grandmaster and concert pianist Mark Taimanov. Smyslov once wrote that, as in music, he tried to achieve harmony on the chess board, with each piece assisting the others. He also recorded operatic arias. 

Dutch insurance company Interpolis once released an EP sung entirely by Smyslov on their record label imprint Interpolis Verzekeringen to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Interpolis chess tournament. The EP, titled &quot;Schaakgrootmeester Vassily Smyslov Zingt&quot; (english: &quot;Chess Grandmaster Vassily Smyslov Sings&quot;), contains vocal covers of traditional Dutch songs accompanied by orchestra conducted by Harry van Hoof.

== Personal life ==

For more than 50 years, Smyslov was married to Nadezhda Smyslova, a woman three years his senior whose first husband was executed during a Stalinist purge in the early 1940s. They met in 1948. Nadezhda had a son from her first marriage, an aspiring chess player who competed at the World Junior Championship. Vasily and Nadezhda had no children of their own. She often accompanied her husband at major tournaments to provide moral support. However, she remained in Moscow during the 1959 Candidates tournament when, to the consternation of Soviet authorities, the normally staid Smyslov had a flagrant affair with a woman grandmaster that affected his play. Smyslov&#x27;s stepson, Vladimir Selimanov, represented the USSR at the 1957 World Junior Championship at Toronto, where he finished 4th. Selimanov died by suicide in 1960.

<text>Cao Zhi (; ; 192 – 27 December 232), courtesy name Zijian (), posthumously known as Prince Si of Chen (陈思王), was a prince of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China, and an accomplished poet in his time. His style of poetry, greatly revered during the Jin dynasty and Southern and Northern Dynasties, came to be known as the &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; style.

Cao Zhi was a son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and laid the foundation for the state of Cao Wei. As Cao Zhi once engaged his elder brother Cao Pi in a power struggle to succeed their father, he was ostracised by his victorious brother after the latter became the emperor and established the Cao Wei state. In his later life, Cao Zhi was not allowed to meddle in politics, despite his many petitions to seek office.

==Early life==
Born in 192, Cao Zhi was the third son of the warlord Cao Cao and Lady Bian. According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), Cao Zhi could recite the &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, &quot;Analects&quot; and more than ten thousand verses worth of poems before he even turned 20. His literary talent made him a favorite son of Cao Cao in the early stage of his life. He married Lady Cui of the Cui clan of Qinghe, a niece of Cui Yan.

==Character and failure==
However, Cao Zhi was an impetuous man with little self-discipline. He was also a heavy drinker. On the other hand, his elder brother Cao Pi knew how to act at the right times. Cao Pi also enjoyed a much closer relationship to the servants and subjects around Cao Cao, and they spoke well of him. In 217, Cao Cao eventually picked Cao Pi to succeed himself. This further aggravated Cao Zhi&#x27;s already eccentric behaviour. He once rode his chariot along the road reserved for the emperor and through the Sima Gate (司马门), the front gate of the palace. This infuriated his father, who had the chariot driver executed.

Cao Zhi&#x27;s wife, Lady Cui, was caught by Cao Cao wearing clothes that were too extravagant and superior to her status, violating the law. As punishment she was forced to commit suicide. She was dressed as Crown Princess (consort of the Crown Prince), which was seen as an affront as the succession discussion had ended in favor of Cao Pi as Crown Prince, so she was killed to prevent any further opposition.

Having chosen a successor, Cao Cao took measures to undermine other contestants. He did this by executing Yang Xiu, a chief adviser to Cao Zhi. This greatly unsettled Cao Zhi, but failed to jolt him back to his senses. On the contrary, he sank further into his drunken habits. In 219, Cao Cao&#x27;s cousin and leading general Cao Ren was besieged at the fortress at Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Hubei) by Guan Yu. Cao Cao named Cao Zhi to lead a relief force to the rescue, in the hope that the task would instil into the latter a sense of responsibility. However, Cao Zhi was so drunk that he could not come forth to take the order. Cao Cao then gave up on this son.

Within months, Cao Cao died. One of the first things Cao Pi did was to do away with Ding Yi (丁儀) and Ding Yì (丁廙), two firm supporters of Cao Zhi. He also sent Cao Zhi, along with the other brothers, away from the capital to a country estate exiling them into the countryside, and prohibited them from taking part in central political issues.

==Continued rejection==
Prospects for Cao Zhi did not improve after Cao Pi died in June 226. He wrote to the second Wei emperor Cao Rui many times, seeking a position to apply his talents. In 232, he even sought a private meeting with Cao Rui to discuss politics. However, Cao Rui probably still considered him a threat to the throne and declined all the offers.

==Death==
Severely depressed by the setbacks and by the news that he was to leave the capital for the third time in eleven years, Cao Zhi soon developed a fatal illness. Aged 41 (by East Asian reckoning), he quickly died in December 232, leaving behind instructions for a simple burial. He was succeeded as Prince of Chen by his son Cao Zhi; Cao Zhi&#x27;s fiefdom was soon shifted to Jibei (济北).

His tomb in Yushan (魚山) of Dong&#x27;e county was excavated in 1951, during which 28 bones were recovered. However, the whereabouts of these bones are currently unknown.

==Poetry==
Despite his failure in politics, Cao Zhi was hailed as one of the representatives of the poetic style of his time, together with his father Cao Cao, his elder brother Cao Pi and several other poets. Their poems formed the backbone of what was to be known as the &quot;Jian&#x27;an poetry&quot; style (建安風骨). The civil strife towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty gave the &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; poems their characteristic solemn yet heart-stirring tone, while lament over the ephemerality of life was also a central theme of works from this period. In terms of the history of Chinese literature, the &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; poems were a transition from the early folk songs into scholarly poetry.

Although &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; refers to the era name between 196 and 220, Cao Zhi&#x27;s poems could in fact be categorised into two periods, with the year 220 as the watershed. The earlier period consisted of poems that expressed his ambitions. These poems were optimistic and romantic in nature. On the other hand, his setbacks in political pursuits after the death of his father in 220 gave rise to the grievous tone of his later works.

More than 90 poems by Cao Zhi remain today, more than 60 of which are five-character poems (五言詩). These are held in high esteem for their significant influence over the development of five-character poetry in later ages. The most complete collection of Cao Zhi&#x27;s poems and other literary works is &quot;Chen Si Wang Ji&quot; (陳思王集, &quot;Collection of Works by King Si of Chen&quot;), compiled during the Ming dynasty. One of Cao Zhi&#x27;s most celebrated poems is &quot;On the White Horse&quot;. Written in the early years of his life, the poem portrayed a young warrior who answered fearlessly to the need of his country and reflected Cao Zhi&#x27;s own aspiration to contribute to his times.
&lt;br&gt;

Cao Zhi&#x27;s most famous poem was the &quot;Seven Steps Verse&quot;, often translated as &quot;The Quatrain of Seven Steps&quot;. However, his authorship of this poem is disputed since the poem comes from the &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;, a collection of ahistorical anecdotes.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a 14th-century historical novel, was a romanticisation of the events that occurred during the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period. Exploiting the complicated relationship among the Cao Cao&#x27;s sons, especially Cao Pi and Cao Zhi, Luo Guanzhong was able to create a scenario where the elder brother, having succeeded his father, tried to do away with his younger brother.

After the death of Cao Cao, Cao Zhi failed to turn up for the funeral. Men sent by Cao Pi found Cao Zhi drunk in his own house. Cao Zhi was then bound and brought to Cao Pi. When Empress Bian, their common birth mother, heard of this, she went to Cao Pi and pleaded for the life of her younger son. Cao Pi agreed. However, Hua Xin then convinced Cao Pi to put Cao Zhi&#x27;s literary talent to a test. If Cao Zhi failed the test, it would be excuse enough to put him to death, Hua Xin suggested.

Cao Pi agreed and held audience with Cao Zhi, who in great trepidation bowed low and confessed his faults. On the wall there was a painting of two oxen fighting, one of which was falling into a well. Cao Pi told his brother to make a poem based on the painting after walking seven paces. However, the poem was not to contain explicit reference to the subjects of the drawing.

Cao Zhi took seven paces as instructed, and the poem was already formulated in his heart. He then recited:
Two butcher&#x27;s victims lowing walked along,&lt;br&gt;
Each head bore curving bones, a sturdy pair.&lt;br&gt;
兩肉齊道行，頭上帶凸骨。

They met just by a hillock, both were strong,&lt;br&gt;
Each would avoid a pit newly-dug there.&lt;br&gt;
相遇塊山下，欻起相搪突。

They fought unequal battle, for at length&lt;br&gt;
One lay below a gory mess, inert.&lt;br&gt;
二敵不俱剛，一肉臥土窟。

&#x27;Twas not that they were of unequal strength&lt;br&gt;
Though wrathful both, one did not strength exert.&lt;br&gt;
非是力不如，盛氣不泄畢。


However, Cao Pi was not satisfied. He then bade Cao Zhi make another poem on the spot based on their fraternal relationship, without using the word &quot;brother&quot;. Not taking a second to think, Cao Zhi recited the famous &quot;Seven Steps Verse&quot;:
煮豆燃豆萁，豆在釜中泣。本是同根生，相煎何太急? (see translations and different renditions in &quot;Seven Steps Verse&quot;)
Having heard this, Cao Pi was moved to tears. He then let his brother go after merely degrading the peerage of the latter as a punishment.

In 2002, Hong Kong&#x27;s TVB produced the television drama, &quot;Where the Legend Begins&quot;, featuring Cao Zhi as the intelligent and compassionate protagonist. Steven Ma played the role of Cao Zhi in the series. There is also a 2013 Chinese television series Legend of Goddess Luo produced by Huace Film and TV, starring Yang Yang as Cao Zhi.

Cao Zhi (Ts&#x27;ao Chih) may be the titular figure of Ezra Pound&#x27;s poem &quot;Ts&#x27;ai Chi&#x27;h&quot;, included in &quot;Des Imagistes&quot; (1914).

<text>Retrofuturism (adjective &quot;retrofuturistic&quot; or &quot;retrofuture&quot;) is a movement in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced in an earlier era. If futurism is sometimes called a &quot;science&quot; bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned &quot;retro styles&quot; with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality, retrofuturism can be seen as &quot;an animating perspective on the world&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word retrofuturism is formed by the addition of the prefix &quot;retro&quot; from the Latin language, which gives the meaning of &quot;backwards&quot; to the word &quot;future&quot;, a word also originating from Latin.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, an early use of the term appears in a Bloomingdales advertisement in a 1983 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The ad talks of jewellery that is &quot;silverized steel and sleek grey linked for a retro-futuristic look&quot;. In an example more related to retrofuturism as an exploration of past visions of the future, the term appears in the form of “retro-futurist” in a 1984 review of the film &quot;Brazil&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Critic Pauline Kael writes, &quot;[Terry Gilliam] presents a retro-futurist fantasy.&quot;

==Historiography==
Retrofuturism builds on ideas of futurism, but the latter term functions differently in several different contexts. In avant-garde artistic, literary and design circles, futurism is a long-standing and well-established term. But in its more popular form, futurism (sometimes referred to as futurology) is &quot;an early optimism that focused on the past and was rooted in the nineteenth century, an early-twentieth-century &#x27;golden age&#x27; that continued long into the 1960s&#x27; Space Age&quot;.

Retrofuturism is first and foremost based on modern but changing notions of &quot;the future&quot;. As Guffey notes, retrofuturism is &quot;a recent neologism&quot;, but it &quot;builds on futurists&#x27; fevered visions of space colonies with flying cars, robotic servants, and interstellar travel on display there; where futurists took their promise for granted, retro-futurism emerged as a more skeptical reaction to these dreams.&quot; It took its current shape in the 1970s, a time when technology was rapidly changing. From the advent of the personal computer to the birth of the first test tube baby, this period was characterized by intense and rapid technological change. But many in the general public began to question whether applied science would achieve its earlier promise—that life would inevitably improve through technological progress. In the wake of the Vietnam War, environmental degradations, and the energy crisis, many commentators began to question the benefits of applied science. But they also wondered, sometimes in awe, sometimes in confusion, at the scientific positivism evinced by earlier generations. Retrofuturism &quot;seeped into academic and popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s&quot;, inflecting George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the paintings of pop artist Kenny Scharf alike&quot;. Surveying the optimistic futurism of the early twentieth century, historians Joe Corn and Brian Horrigan remind us that retrofuturism is &quot;a history of an idea, or a system of ideas—an ideology. The future, of course, does not exist except as an act of belief or imagination.&quot;

==Characteristics==
Retrofuturism incorporates two overlapping trends which may be summarized as &quot;the future as seen from the past&quot; and &quot;the past as seen from the future&quot;.

The first trend, retrofuturism proper, is directly inspired by the imagined future which existed in the minds of writers, artists, and filmmakers in the pre-1960 period who attempted to predict the future, either in serious projections of existing technology (e.g. in magazines like &quot;Science and Invention&quot;) or in science fiction novels and stories. Such futuristic visions are refurbished and updated for the present, and offer a nostalgic, counterfactual image of what the future might have been, but is not.

The second trend is the inverse of the first: futuristic retro. It starts with the retro appeal of old styles of art, clothing, mores, and then grafts modern or futuristic technologies onto it, creating a mélange of past, present, and future elements. Steampunk, a term applying both to the retrojection of futuristic technology into an alternative Victorian age, and the application of neo-Victorian styles to modern technology, is a highly successful version of this second trend. In the movie &quot;Space Station 76&quot; (2014), mankind has reached the stars, but clothes, technology, furnitures and above all social taboos are purposely highly reminiscent of the mid-1970s.

In practice, the two trends cannot be sharply distinguished, as they mutually contribute to similar visions. Retrofuturism of the first type is inevitably influenced by the scientific, technological, and social awareness of the present, and modern retrofuturistic creations are never simply copies of their pre-1960 inspirations; rather, they are given a new (often wry or ironic) twist by being seen from a modern perspective.

In the same way, futuristic retro owes much of its flavor to early science fiction (e.g. the works of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells), and in a quest for stylistic authenticity may continue to draw on writers and artists of the desired period.

Both retrofuturistic trends in themselves refer to no specific time. When a time period is supplied for a story, it might be a counterfactual present with unique technology; a fantastic version of the future; or an alternate past in which the imagined (fictitious or projected) inventions of the past were indeed real.

The import of retrofuturism has, in recent years, come under considerable discussion. Some, like the German architecture critic Niklas Maak, see retrofuturism as &quot;nothing more than an aesthetic feedback loop recalling a lost belief in progress, the old images of the once radically new&quot;. Bruce McCall calls retrofuturism a &quot;faux nostalgia&quot;—the nostalgia for a future that never happened.

==Themes==
Although retrofuturism, due to the varying time-periods and futuristic visions to which it alludes, does not provide a unified thematic purpose or experience, a common thread is dissatisfaction or discomfort with the present, to which retrofuturism provides a nostalgic contrast.

A similar theme is dissatisfaction with the modern world itself. A world of high-speed air transport, computers, and space stations is (by any past standard) &quot;futuristic&quot;; yet the search for alternative and perhaps more promising futures suggests a feeling that the desired or expected future has failed to materialize. Retrofuturism suggests an alternative path, and in addition to pure nostalgia, may act as a reminder of older but now forgotten ideals. This dissatisfaction also manifests as political commentary in Retrofuturistic literature, in which visionary nostalgia is paradoxically linked to a utopian future modelled after conservative values as seen in the example of Fox News&#x27; use of BioShock&#x27;s aesthetic in a 2014 broadcast.

Retrofuturism also implies a reevaluation of technology. Unlike the total rejection of post-medieval technology found in most fantasy genres, or the embrace of any and all possible technologies found in some science-fiction, retrofuturism calls for a human-scale, largely comprehensible technology, amenable to tinkering and less opaque than modern black-box technology.

Retrofuturism has two main viewpoints that it stems from either an optimistic viewpoint or a pessimistic view. Retrofuturism which stems from an optimistic viewpoint tends to be an imagined futuristic society that comes from an advancement in technology in order to explore for the sake of science. Retrofuturism is not universally optimistic, and when its points of reference touch on gloomy periods like World War II, or the paranoia of the Cold War, it may itself become bleak and dystopian. This pessimistic retrofuturism is often imagined with technological advancement either being the downfall of humanity or being the last hope for humanity. In such cases, the alternative reality inspires fear, not hope, though it may still be coupled with nostalgia for a world of greater moral as well as mechanical transparency. It has been argued that retrofuturism, through finding hope in the disappointment and dystopia, and using that hope to push towards a brighter future, can be optimistic. Similarly, the visions of utopias depicted in retrofuturistic pieces can re-instill that hopefulness in audiences that have lost it.

==Genres==

Genres of retrofuturism include cyberpunk, steampunk, dieselpunk, atompunk, and Raygun Gothic, each referring to a technology from a specific time period.

The first of these to be named and recognized as its own genre was cyberpunk, originating in the early to mid-1980s in literature with the works of Bruce Bethke, William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and Pat Cadigan. Its setting is almost always a dystopian future, with a strong emphasis either upon outlaws hacking the futuristic world&#x27;s machinery (often computers and computer networks), or even upon post-apocalyptic settings. The post-apocalyptic variant is the one usually associated with retrofuturism, where characters will rely upon a mixture of old and new technologies. Furthermore, synthwave and vaporwave are nostalgic, humorous and often retrofuturistic revivals of early cyberpunk aesthetic.

The term &quot;steampunk&quot; was among the early subgenres recognized, emerging in the late 1980s. It presents a generally more optimistic and brighter outlook compared to cyberpunk. Steampunk is typically set in an alternate history closely resembling our own from the late 18th century, particularly the Regency era onwards, up to approximately 1914. However, it diverges from history in that it envisions 20th-century or even futuristic technologies powered by steam.

One of the recurring themes in this genre is the fascination with electricity as a mysterious force, often considered a utopian power source of the future. It&#x27;s occasionally portrayed as having mystical healing properties, akin to how nuclear energy was perceived in the mid-20th century. Steampunk shares similarities with the original scientific romances and utopian novels of authors like H. G. Wells and Jules Verne.

The modern form of steampunk literature can be traced back to works such as Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Titus Alone&quot; (1959), Ronald W. Clark&#x27;s &quot;Queen Victoria&#x27;s Bomb&quot; (1967), Michael Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;A Nomad of the Time Streams&quot; series (1971–1981), K. W. Jeter&#x27;s &quot;Morlock Night&quot; (1979), and William Gibson &amp; Bruce Sterling&#x27;s &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990). In the realm of cinema, early examples include &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960) and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986).

An early instance of steampunk in comics can be found in the Franco-Belgian graphic novel series &quot;Les Cités obscures,&quot; initiated by creators François Schuiten and Benoît Peeters in the early 1980s. On occasion, steampunk blurs the lines with the Weird West genre.

The most recently named and recognized retrofuturistic genre is dieselpunk aka decodence (the term dieselpunk is often associated with a more pulpish form and decodence, named after the contemporary art movement of Art Deco, with a more sophisticated form), set in alternate versions of an era located circa in the period of the 1920s–1950s. Early examples include the 1970s concept albums, their designs and marketing materials of the German band Kraftwerk (see below), the comic-book character Rocketeer (first appearing in his own series in 1982), the &quot;Fallout&quot; series of video games, and films such as &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994), &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), and &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998). Especially the lower end of the genre strongly mimic the pulp literature of the era (such as the 2004 film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;), and films of the genre often reference the cinematic styles of film noir and German Expressionism. At times, the genre overlaps with the alternate history genre of a different World War II, such as with an Axis victory.

==Design and arts==
Although loosely affiliated with early-twentieth century Futurism, retrofuturism draws from a wider range of sources. To be sure, retrofuturist art and literature often draws from the factories, buildings, cities, and transportation systems of the machine age. But it might be said that 20th century futuristic vision found its ultimate expression in the development of Googie architecture or Populuxe design. As applied to fiction, this brand of retrofuturistic visual style began to take shape in William Gibson&#x27;s short story &quot;The Gernsback Continuum&quot;. Here and elsewhere it is referred to as Raygun Gothic, a catchall term for a visual style that incorporates various aspects of the Googie, Streamline Moderne, and Art Deco architectural styles when applied to retrofuturistic science fiction environments.

Although Raygun Gothic is most similar to the Googie or Populuxe style and sometimes synonymous with it, the name is primarily applied to images of science fiction. The style is also still a popular choice for retro sci-fi in film and video games. Raygun Gothic&#x27;s primary influences include the set designs of Kenneth Strickfaden and Fritz Lang. The term was coined by William Gibson in his story &quot;The Gernsback Continuum&quot;: &quot;Cohen introduced us and explained that Dialta [a noted pop-art historian] was the prime mover behind the latest Barris-Watford project, an illustrated history of what she called &#x27;American Streamlined Modern&#x27;. Cohen called it &#x27;raygun Gothic&#x27;. Their working title was &quot;The Airstream Futuropolis: The Tomorrow That Never Was.&quot;&quot;

Aspects of this form of retrofuturism can also be associated with the late 1970s and early 1980s the neo-Constructivist revival that emerged in art and design circles. Designers like David King in the UK and Paula Scher in the US imitated the cool, futuristic look of the Russian avant-garde in the years following the Russian Revolution.

With three of their 1970s albums, German band Kraftwerk tapped into a larger retrofuturist vision, by combining their futuristic pioneering electronic music with nostalgic visuals. Kraftwerk&#x27;s retro-futurism in their 1970s visual language has been referred to by German literary critic Uwe Schütte, a reader at Aston University, Birmingham, as &quot;clear retro-style&quot;, and in the 2008 three-hour documentary &quot;Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution&quot;, Irish-British music scholar Mark J. Prendergast refers to Kraftwerk&#x27;s peculiar &quot;nostalgia for the future&quot; clearly referencing &quot;an interwar &quot;[progressive]&quot; Germany that never was but could&#x27;ve been, and now &quot;[due to their influence as a band]&quot; hopefully could happen again&quot;. Design historian Elizabeth Guffey has written that if Kraftwerk&#x27;s machine imagery was lifted from Russian design motifs that were once considered futuristic, they also presented a &quot;compelling, if somewhat chilling, vision of the world in which musical ecstasy is rendered cool, mechanical and precise.&quot; Kraftwerk&#x27;s three retrofuturist albums are:

*Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; showed a 1930s radio on the cover, its inlay (which for its later CD re-release was widely expanded as a booklet illustrated in the same nostalgic style) showed the band photographed in black and white with old-fashioned suits and hairdos, and the music in its instrumentation as well as its ambiguous lyrics were (besides the other obvious theme of nuclear decay and nuclear power referenced by the album&#x27;s titular pun) in homage to the &quot;Radio Stars&quot;, that is the pioneers of electronic music of the first half of the 20th century, such as Guglielmo Marconi, Léon Theremin, Pierre Schaeffer, and Karlheinz Stockhausen (due to whom the band referred to themselves as but the &quot;second generation&quot; of electronic music).
*The European version of the band&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; had a similar 1930s-style black and white photo of the band members on the cover (the U.S. version even had a cover of a vintage-style colored photograph in the style of Golden Age Hollywood stars), the style of the sleeve design as well as the design of promotional material tying in with the album were influenced by Bauhaus, Art Deco, and Streamline Moderne, the record came with a large, hand-tinted black and white poster of the band members in early-1930s style suits (where band member Karl Bartos later said in &quot;Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution&quot; that their intention was to visually resemble &quot;an interwar string orchestra electrified&quot; and that the background was meant to be a pictorial Switzerland where the band was making a resting stop in-between two legs of their European tour on the eponymous &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;), the song lyrics referenced the &quot;elegance and decadence&quot; of an urban interwar Europe, and in the promo clip made for the album&#x27;s title song (shot in black and white on purpose) and other promotional material, the eponymous &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; was portrayed by the &quot;Schienenzeppelin&quot; first employed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1931 (footage of the large original was used in outdoor shots, and a miniature model of it was used for shots where the TEE moved through a futuristic cityscape strongly reminiscent of Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot;).
*The cover and sleeve design of the 1978 album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; exhibits an obvious stylistic nod to the Constructivism of 1920s artists such as El Lissitzky, Alexander Rodchenko, and László Moholy-Nagy (due to which band members have also referred to it as &quot;the Russian album&quot;), and one song references the film &quot;Metropolis&quot; again. From this album on, Kraftwerk would also use their &quot;show-room dummies&quot; aka robot lookalikes on stage and in promotional material and increase the use of slightly campish make-up on band members that also resembled 1920s&#x27; expressionist make-up that to a lesser degree had already appeared in the promotional material for their 1977 album &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;.

From their 1981 album &quot;Computer World&quot; onwards, Kraftwerk have largely abandoned their retro notions and appear mainly futuristic only. The only references to their earlier retro style today appear in excerpts from their 1970s&#x27; promo clips that are projected in between more modern segments in their stage shows during the performance of these old song.

Retrofuturistic clothing is a particular imagined vision of the clothing that might be worn in the distant future, typically found in science fiction and science fiction films of the 1940s onwards, but also in journalism and other popular culture. The garments envisioned have most commonly been either one-piece garments, skin-tight garments, or both, typically ending up looking like either overalls or leotards, often worn together with plastic boots. In many cases, there is an assumption that the clothing of the future will be highly uniform.

The cliché of futuristic clothing has now become part of the idea of retrofuturism. Futuristic fashion plays on these now-hackneyed stereotypes, and recycles them as elements into the creation of real-world clothing fashions.

&quot;We&#x27;ve actually seen this look creeping up on the runway as early as 1995, though it hasn&#x27;t been widely popular or acceptable street wear even through 2008,&quot; said Brooke Kelley, fashion editor and &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine writer. &quot;For the last 20 years, fashion has reviewed the times of past, decade by decade, and what we are seeing now is a combination of different eras into one complete look. Future fashion is a style beyond anything we&#x27;ve yet dared to wear, and it&#x27;s going to be a trend setter&#x27;s paradise.&quot;

===Architecture===


Retrofuturism has appeared in some examples of postmodern architecture. To critics such as Niklas Maak, the term suggests that the &quot;future style&quot; is &quot;a mere quotation of its own iconographic tradition&quot; and retrofuturism is little more than &quot;an aesthetic feedback loop&quot; In the example seen at right, the upper portion of the building is not intended to be integrated with the building but rather to appear as a separate object—a huge flying saucer-like space ship only incidentally attached to a conventional building. This appears intended not to evoke an even remotely possible future, but rather a past imagination of that future, or a reembracing of the futuristic vision of Googie architecture.

The once-futuristic Los Angeles International Airport Theme Building was built in 1961 as an expression of the then new jet and space ages, incorporating what later came to be known as Googie and Populuxe design elements. Plans unveiled in 2008 for LAX&#x27;s expansion featured retrofuturist flying-saucer/spaceship themes in proposals for new terminals and concourses.

===Music===
* Modern electro style, influenced by Detroit-based artist in the early 80s (such as Drexciya, Aux 88, Cybotron). This style blend old analog gear (Roland Tr-808 and synths) and sampling methods from the 80&#x27;s with modern approach of electro. The records labels involved in this journey are AMZS Recording, Gosu, Osman, Traffic Records and many others.
* Canadian band Alvvays&#x27;s music video, &quot;Dreams Tonite&quot;, which includes archival footage of Montreal&#x27;s Expo 67 was described by the band as &quot;fetishizing retro-futurism&quot;.
* English band Electric Light Orchestra released their concept album &quot;Time&quot; in 1981. This album follows a man who wakes up in the year 2095 and how he reacts to this sudden change as well as his longing to be back in 1981. There are multiple descriptions of life and what technology is like in 2095.

=== Film and television ===
* Director Brad Bird describes his 2004 Pixar film &quot;The Incredibles&quot; as &quot;looking like what we thought the future would turn out like in the 1960s.&quot;
* British filmmaker Richard Ayoade noted his film &quot;The Double&quot; from 2013 was designed with the intention of looking like &quot;the future imagined by someone in the past who got it wrong.&quot;
* The 2015 Disney film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;, based on Disneyland&#x27;s attraction by the same name, directed by Brad Bird, has retrofuturistic aesthetic.
* The Time Variance Authority in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is reminiscent of 60&#x27;s office building, with many futuristic devices scattered throughout.
* The 2024 &quot;Fallout&quot; live-action series, based on the homonymous video game franchise, is set in a 1950s-inspired Raygun Gothic and Atompunk retrofuture.
* The upcoming 2025 film &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot; of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has elements of 1960s retrofuturism.
