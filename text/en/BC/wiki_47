<text>Biphobia is aversion toward bisexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being bisexual. Similarly to homophobia, it refers to hatred and prejudice specifically against those identified or perceived as being in the bisexual community. It can take the form of denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). Other forms of biphobia include bisexual erasure. Biphobia may also avert towards other sexualities attracted to multiple genders such as pansexuality or polysexuality, as the idea of being attracted to multiple genders is generally the cause of stigma towards bisexuality.

The hatred of bisexual women and femmes, being a form of prejudice at the intersection of biphobia and misogyny, is referred to as bimisogyny or less commonly bisexism. This is a gendered form of biphobia that accounts for intersectionality in discussions on bigotry.

== Etymology and usage ==
&quot;Biphobia&quot; is a blend word patterned on the term &quot;homophobia&quot;. It derives from the Latin prefix bi-(meaning &quot;two, double&quot;) and the root &quot;-phobia&quot; (from the , &quot;phóbos&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;) found in &quot;homophobia&quot;. Along with &quot;transphobia&quot; and &quot;homophobia&quot;, it is one of a family of terms used to describe intolerance and discrimination against LGBTQ people. The adjectival form &quot;biphobic&quot; describes things or qualities related to biphobia, and the less-common noun &quot;biphobe&quot; is a label for people thought to harbor biphobia.

The term &quot;biphobia&quot; was first introduced in 1992 by researcher Kathleen Bennett to mean &quot;prejudice against bisexuality&quot; and &quot;the denigration of bisexuality as a life-choice.&quot; It has subsequently been defined as &quot;any portrayal or discourse denigrating or criticizing men or women on the sole ground of their belonging to this [bisexual] socio-sexual identity, or refusing them the right to claim it.&quot;

Biphobia need not be a phobia as defined in clinical psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of xenophobia.

== Forms ==
=== Denial and erasure ===

Biphobia can lead people to deny that bisexuality is real, asserting that people who &quot;identify&quot; as bisexual are not &quot;genuinely&quot; bisexual, or that the phenomenon is far less common than they claim. One form of this denial is based on the heterosexist view that heterosexuality is the only true or natural sexual orientation. Thus anything that deviates from that is instead either a psychological pathology or an example of anti-social behavior.

Another form of denial stems from binary views of sexuality: that people are assumed monosexual, i.e. homosexual (gay/lesbian) or heterosexual (straight). Throughout the 1980s, modern research on sexuality was dominated by the idea that heterosexuality and homosexuality were the only legitimate orientations, dismissing bisexuality as &quot;secondary homosexuality&quot;. In that model, bisexuals are presumed to be either closeted lesbian/gay people wishing to appear heterosexual, or individuals (of &quot;either&quot; orientation) experimenting with sexuality outside of their &quot;normal&quot; interest. Maxims such as &quot;people are either gay, straight, or lying&quot; embody this dichotomous view of sexual orientation.

Some people accept the theoretical existence of bisexuality but define it narrowly, as being only the equal sexual attraction towards both men and women. Thus the many bisexual individuals with unequal attractions are instead categorized as either homosexual or heterosexual. Others acknowledge the existence of bisexuality in women, but deny that men can be bisexual.

Some denial asserts that bisexual behavior or identity is merely a social trend – as exemplified by &quot;bisexual chic&quot; or gender bending – and not an intrinsic personality trait. Same-gender sexual activity is dismissed as merely a substitute for sex with members of the opposite sex, or as a more accessible source of sexual gratification. Situational homosexuality in sex-segregated environments is presented as an example of this behavior.

Biphobia is common from the heterosexual community, but is frequently exhibited by gay and lesbian people as well, usually with the notion that bisexuals are able to escape oppression from heterosexuals by conforming to social expectations of opposite-gender sex and romance. This leaves some that identify as bisexual to be perceived as &quot;not enough of either&quot; or &quot;not real&quot;. An Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 established that bisexual people faced microaggressions, bullying, and other anti-social behaviors from people within the lesbian and gay community.

Bisexual erasure (also referred to as &quot;bisexual invisibility&quot;) is a phenomenon that tends to omit, falsify, or re-explain evidence of bisexuality in history, academia, the news media, and other primary sources, sometimes to the point of denying that bisexuality exists.

Kenji Yoshino (2000) writes that there are three concepts that cause invisibility within bisexuality: &quot;The three invisibilities can be seen as nested within each other; the first affects straights, gays, and bisexuals; the second affects only gays and bisexuals; and the third affects only bisexuals.&quot; Forms of social standards and expectations, religion, and integrating the same-sex attraction aspect of bisexuality with homosexuality contribute to invisibility.

==== Allegations that bisexual men are homophobic ====
One cause of biphobia in the gay male community is that there is an identity political tradition to assume that acceptance of male homosexuality is linked to the belief that men&#x27;s sexuality is specialized. This causes many members of the gay male community to assume that the very idea that men can be bisexual is homophobic to gay men. A number of bisexual men feel that such attitudes force them to keep their bisexuality in the closet and that it is even more oppressive than traditional heteronormativity. These men argue that the gay male community has something to learn about respect for the individual from the lesbian community, in which there is not a strong tradition to assume links between notions about the origins of sexual preferences and the acceptance thereof. These views are also supported by some gay men who do not like anal sex (sides, as opposed to both tops and bottoms) and report that they feel bullied by other gay men&#x27;s assumption that their dislike for anal sex is &quot;homophobic&quot; and want more respect for the individuality in which a gay man who does not hate himself may simply not like anal sex and instead prefer other sex acts such as mutual fellatio and mutual male masturbation.

====Claims of bisexuals adapting to heteronormativity====
Some forms of prejudice against bisexuals are claims that bisexuality is an attempt in persecuted homosexuals to adapt to heteronormative societies by adopting a bisexual identity. Such claims are criticized by bisexuals and researchers studying the situation of bisexuals for falsely assuming that same-sex relationships would somehow escape persecution in heteronormative cultures by simply identifying as bisexual instead of homosexual. These researchers cite that all countries with laws against sex between people of the same sex give the same punishment regardless of what sexual orientation the people found guilty identify as, that any countries where same-sex marriage is illegal never allow marriages between people of the same sex no matter if they identify as bisexual instead of homosexual, and that laws against &quot;gay&quot; male blood donors invariably prohibit any man who had sex with other men from donating blood no matter if he identifies as homosexual or as bisexual. The conclusion made by these researchers is that since there is no societal benefit in identifying as bisexual instead of identifying as homosexual, the claim that bisexuals are homosexuals trying to adapt to a heteronormative society is simply false and biphobic and causes bisexuals to suffer a two-way discrimination from both LGBTQ society and heteronormative society that is worse than the one-way discrimination from heteronormative society that is faced by homosexuals. It is also argued that such two-way discrimination causes many bisexuals to hide their bisexuality to an even greater extent than homosexuals hide their sexuality, leading to underestimations of the prevalence of bisexuality especially in men for whom such assumptions of &quot;really being completely gay&quot; are the most rampant.

In the book &quot;Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution&quot;, Shiri Eisner (2013) mentions Miguel Obradors-Campos&#x27; argument that bisexual individuals endure stigma by heterosexuals as well as gay and lesbian individuals. Eisner (2013) also writes, &quot;some forms of biphobic stigma frequently observed in gay and lesbian communities: that bisexuals are privileged, that bisexuals will ultimately choose heterosexual relationships and lifestyles, that bisexual women are reinforcing patriarchy, that bisexuality is not a political identity, that bisexual women carry HIV to lesbian communities, and so on.&quot;

=== Negative stereotypes ===
Many stereotypes about people who identify as bisexual stem from denial or bisexual erasure. Because their orientation is not recognized as valid, they are stereotyped as confused, indecisive, insecure, experimenting, or &quot;just going through a phase&quot;.

The association of bisexuality with promiscuity stems from a variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women, or only with one person at a time is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural assumptions that &quot;men and women are so different that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other&quot; (&quot;a defining feature of heterosexism&quot;), and that &quot;verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire.&quot;

As a result, bisexuals may bear a social stigma from accusations of cheating on or betraying their partners, leading a double life, being &quot;on the down-low&quot;, and spreading sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This presumed behavior is further generalized as dishonesty, secrecy, and deception. Bisexuals can be characterized as being &quot;slutty&quot;, &quot;easy&quot;, indiscriminate, and nymphomaniacs. Furthermore, they are strongly associated with polyamory, swinging, and polygamy, the last being an established heterosexual tradition sanctioned by some religions and legal in several countries. This is despite the fact that bisexual people are as capable of monogamy or serial monogamy as homosexuals or heterosexuals.

==== Tensions with pansexuals ====

Bisexuals frequently struggle with myths and misconceptions about the definition of bisexuality, such as the idea that bisexuality conforms to the gender binary (thereby excluding attraction to nonbinary individuals), or excludes attraction to trans people in general. This sometimes creates tension between bisexuals and pansexuals, as pansexuals often see themselves as being more inclusive to a wider array of genders. A 2022 study by the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot; suggested that the majority of women who identify as pansexual or queer defined bisexuality as limited to attraction to cisgender men and women and critiqued bisexuality as reinforcing the traditional gender binary. However, bisexual women defined bisexuality as attraction to two or more, or &quot;similar or dissimilar&quot; genders, described bisexuality as inclusive of attractions to all genders, and reported negative psychological outcomes as a result of the debate around bisexual gender inclusivity.

A 2017 study published in the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot; found that when bisexuals and pansexuals described gender and defined bisexuality, &quot;there were no differences in how pansexual and bisexual people ... discussed sex or gender&quot;, and that the findings &quot;do not support the stereotype that bisexual people endorse a binary view of gender while pansexual people do not.&quot;

== Effects ==
The mental and sexual health effects of biphobia on bisexual people are numerous. One study showed that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity. This often leads to recognized indicators of mental health issues such as low self-esteem and self-worth. These indicators and pressures to &quot;choose&quot; a sexual identity can, in many cases, lead to depression as they may feel they live in a culture that does not recognize their existence.

While doing research on women at high risk of HIV infection, one study, from the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality,&quot; concluded that bisexual women in the high-risk cohort studied were more likely to engage in various high-risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals discussing their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, causing them to become undereducated on the issue(s).
In the book, &quot;Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution&quot;, Shiri Eisner (2013) discusses the suicidality statistics amongst bisexual identifying individuals as compared to heterosexuals, gays, and lesbians. Eisner (2013) referred to a Canadian study that found bisexual women had higher rates of suicidality as compared to heterosexual and lesbian women; the study also found that bisexual men also had increased rates of suicidality as compared to heterosexual and gay men.

Bisexual-identified people may face disparities in harsher degrees than their gay and lesbian peers. In the U.S. in particular, for example, they may face:

* Lower success rates for refugee applications; may also be the case in Canada and Australia
* Higher levels of intimate partner violence
* Higher likelihood of youth risk behavior amongst high school students
* Higher likelihood of anxiety and mood disorders amongst bisexual women and men who report having sex with both sexes
* Higher likelihood of living on less than $30,000 a year
* Lower levels of reporting feeling &quot;very accepted&quot; in the workplace
* Lower likelihood of being out to the important people in their lives
* &quot;Bisexuals report higher rates of hypertension, poor or fair physical health, smoking, and risky drinking than heterosexuals or lesbians/gays&quot;
* &quot;Bisexual women in relationships with monosexual partners have an increased rate of domestic violence compared to women in other demographic categories&quot;
* &quot;Many, if not most, bisexual people do not come out to their healthcare providers. This means they are getting incomplete information (for example, about safer sex practices)&quot;
* &quot;Bisexual women were more likely to be current smokers and acute drinkers&quot;
* Higher risk of self harm, and suicidal ideation or attempts
* Feeling shame or discomfort with their sexual orientation or not feeling ready to be &quot;out&quot; to loved ones

== Intersectional perspectives ==

=== Intersections with feminism ===
Feminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as a reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism.

A bisexual woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine &quot;Common Lives/Lesbian Lives&quot;, alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.

A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were &quot;deluded and desperate&quot;. However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a &quot;fashionable trend&quot; being promoted due to &quot;sexual hedonism&quot; and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.

Lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in &quot;The Lesbian Heresy&quot; (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to sexually harass women, bisexual men are just as likely to be bothersome to women as heterosexual men.

Donna Haraway was the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century&quot; which was reprinted in &quot;Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature&quot; (1991). Haraway&#x27;s essay states that the cyborg &quot;has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.&quot;

 The lipstick lesbian flag was introduced in 2010 by Natalie McCray, but has not been widely adopted; some lesbians are against it because McCray&#x27;s blog had biphobic (and racist and transphobic) comments, and because it does not include butch lesbians.

=== Intersections with gender ===
==== Men ====
Studies indicate that preferences against dating bisexual men are stronger than against bisexual women, even amongst bisexual women.

=== Intersections with race ===
While the general bisexual population as a whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In a study conducted by Grady L. Garner Jr. titled &quot;Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective&quot;, the author interviews 14 self-identified black bisexual men to examine how they cope with heterosexism and biphobia in order to formulate coping strategies. Data from the interviews revealed that 33% of the participants reported heterosexism and biphobia experiences, while 67% did not. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones.

<text>Humbaba (Ḫumbaba; , &quot;Ḫûmbaba&quot;, with an optional determinative ), originally known as Ḫuwawa in Sumerian (, &quot;Ḫuwawa&quot;), was a figure in Mesopotamian mythology. The origin and meaning of his name are unknown. He was portrayed as an anthropomorphic figure comparable to an ogre or giant. He is best known from Sumerian and Akkadian narratives focused on the hero Gilgamesh, including short compositions belonging to the curriculum of scribal schools, various versions of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, and several Hurrian and Hittite adaptations. He is invariably portrayed as the inhabitant or guardian of the cedar forest, to which Gilgamesh ventures with his companion Enkidu. The subsequent encounter leads to the death of Humbaba, which provokes the anger of the gods. Humbaba is also attested in other works of Mesopotamian literature. Multiple depictions of him have also been identified, including combat scenes and apotropaic clay heads.

It has been suggested that the iconography of Humbaba influenced depictions of the gorgons in Greece, in particular scenes of Perseus slaying Medusa with the help of Athena. A late derivative of Humbaba also seems to be found in both Jewish and Manichaean versions of the &quot;Book of Giants&quot;, where one of the eponymous beings is referred to as Ḥôbabiš, Ḥôbabis or Ḥōbāīš. While it is agreed the name is derived from his own, the context in which it appears shows no similarity to known myths involving him. Traces of Ḥôbabiš have also been identified in a number of later works belonging to Islamic tradition, such as religious polemics. A number of connections have also been proposed between Humbaba and figures such as Kombabos from the works of Lucian or biblical Hobab, but they are not regarded as plausible.

==Name==
The name Humbaba (Ḫumbaba) first occurs as an ordinary personal name in documents from the Ur III period. The modern spelling reflects the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian copies of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, where it is consistently written in cuneiform as &quot;Ḫum-ba-ba&quot;, but this variant is not attested before the first millennium BCE. The oldest attested form is conventionally rendered as Ḫuwawa, though multiple cuneiform spellings are attested: &quot;Ḫu-wa-wa&quot;, &quot;Ḫu-ba-ba&quot; and &quot;Ḫu&quot;-Ú-Ú, the last of which has two possible readings due to the sign Ú standing for both &quot;ba6&quot; and &quot;wax&quot;. In texts from Mari and Tell Harmal, in which the scribal conventions reflect the closely related traditions of the Middle Euphrates and the Eshnunna-influenced Diyala area, the name is instead spelled as &quot;Ḫu-bi-bi&quot;, which seemingly reflects the pronunciation /Ḫuppipi/. On lexical grounds it is presumed that similar reading of the name, even when it was written as &quot;Ḫu-wa-wa&quot;, might have also been the norm elsewhere in Syria, for example in Alalakh, as well as in Hittite and Hurrian sources, which might indicate Ḫuppipi was the default form in both north and west of the Mesopotamian cultural sphere of influence. Unique forms showing inflection are attested in copies from Ugarit (nominative &quot;Ḫu-ba-bu&quot;, genitive &quot;Ḫu-ba-bi&quot;) and from Assyria from the Middle Assyrian period (accusative &quot;Ḫu-ba-ba&quot; and genitive &quot;Ḫu-be-be&quot;). Additionally abbreviated forms, Ḫuwa and Ḫu, are known from an Old Babylonian version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; presently belonging to the Schøyen Collection.

Many of the variants of Humbaba&#x27;s name are attested both with and without the so-called &quot;divine determinative&quot; (&quot;dingir&quot;). Examples of its use have been identified in texts from Kish, Ur, Nerebtum, Susa and possibly Larsa and Shaduppum. A fragment of a Hurrian literary text using it is also known. However, no sources indicate that Humbaba was necessarily regarded as a god. In modern literature, he is variously described as an &quot;ogre&quot;, &quot;demon&quot; or &quot;giant&quot;. In a passage from one of the Old Babylonian copies of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, he is described as &quot;ḫarḫaru&quot;, based on context presumably &quot;ogre&quot;, &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;freak&quot;. He is generally portrayed as anthropomorphic.

Humbaba’s name shows no obvious signs of specific linguistic affiliation and its meaning is unknown. Similarly structured names are sometimes referred to as “banana names” in Assyriology. It is sometimes assumed that they belong to a linguistic substrate, but this view is not universally accepted, and it is not certain if all of them come from the same language. Frans Wiggermann instead suggests that Humbaba’s name might have originally been an onomatopoeia: he argues he was in origin an apotropaic grinning face hung on doors to ward off evil, with his name being a representation of the sounds he was believed to make. He assumes the myths involving him served as an etiology meant to explain this custom.

The phonetically similar names of a stone, &quot;na5ḫúb-be-be&quot;, and a lizard, &quot;ḫuwawītum&quot;, were both derived from Humbaba&#x27;s own.

===Disproved proposals===
While such a possibility has been suggested in older scholarship, the name Ḫumḫum does not refer to Humbaba, but to an unrelated minor god worshiped in Dūr-Šarrukku, as attested in a text from the reign of Esarhaddon mentioning the return of his statue. 

It has also been argued that Humbaba was derived from the Elamite god Humban, but according to Andrew R. George this proposal is not plausible in the light of available evidence, and the most recent attempt at justifying this connection, undertaken by John Hansman in the 1970s, rests on &quot;unsafe historical conclusions&quot;. 

==Humbaba and Gilgamesh==

Humbaba appears in multiple works of Mesopotamian literature focused on the hero Gilgamesh, in which he invariably acts as his adversary during a quest to obtain cedar wood from a distant forest.

===&quot;Gilgamesh and Huwawa&quot; A and B===
The oldest composition describing the confrontation between Gilgamesh and Humbaba has two versions, the Sumerian &quot;Gilgamesh and Huwawa&quot; A and &quot;Gilgamesh and Huwawa&quot; B (Gilgamesh was previously read as &quot;Bilgames&quot; A and &quot;Bilgames and Ḫuwawa&quot; B). Copies of version A are more common. Of all known Gilgamesh texts it was seemingly the most often copied one, with between 85 and 92 examples identified by 2010. Their broad distribution reflects the use of the text in scribal training. It belonged to the so-called &quot;decad&quot;, a set of texts which formed the basis of scribal education in the early second millennium BCE.

In the early poems, Humbaba is described as an intimidating &quot;mountain man&quot; of unknown origin, but there is no indication that his appearance was distinct from that of a human, and he is chiefly set apart from mortals by his supernatural powers. The source of his invulnerability are his seven “auras” or “terrors”, Sumerian &quot;ni2&quot; or &quot;me2-lam&quot;. While a singular aura was a common attribute of deities, seven auras are for the most part exclusively attested in connection to Humbaba, though an exception, the tablet CBS 7972 (STVC 40) + N 3718, a fragment of a hymn dedicated to Nergal, has been identified and subsequently published by Jeremiah Peterson in 2008.

The location of the forest where Humbaba lives is not precisely defined outside of a reference to “seven ranges” which need to be crossed to reach it, but it is commonly assumed that the heroes’ destination was the Iranian highlands. Similar formulaic phrases are used to refer to this area in myths about Lugalbanda and Enmerkar known to partially take place in this area. It has been proposed that making an eastern location the target of the expedition was meant to symbolically reflect the geopolitics of the Ur III period. However, a western location, specifically Lebanon, is also sometimes proposed.

In version A, Gilgamesh encounters Humbaba after realizing the impermanence of life prompts him to embark on a quest to bring cedar wood to his city to acquire lasting fame. When Humbaba notices Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu cut down one of the trees, he uses one of his auras to stun them. After awakening Gilgamesh vows that he will not go back before he finds out whether the attacker is human or divine. Enkidu doubts if they can defeat him, but he is eventually convinced by Gilgamesh’s bravado. Due to the powers the auras grant to Humbaba, he cannot be defeated through conventional means, and Enkidu suggests tricking him into willfully casting them off. Gilgamesh accomplishes that by offering him various bribes, including goods not available in the remote forest such as fine flour, water in leather containers, small and big sandals, gemstones and other similar gifts, as well as a promise that he will be able to marry his sisters:

The scene is presumed to be humorous, and seems to portray Humbaba as lonely and gullible. Piotr Michalowski additionally notes the quoted passage might be a satire targeting the well attested custom of marrying the daughters from the royal line to rulers of neighboring kingdoms in the Ur III period. Similar interpretation has also been proposed by Andrew R. George. The episode is absent from the later editions of the narrative. Humbaba accepts Gilgamesh’s proposal, and offers him his auras, which are described as cedar-like and possible to cut into logs for transport. According to George, their form might be an indication that while seemingly anthropomorphic, Humbaba was himself envisioned as partially tree-like. As soon as he gives up on the last of the auras and loses his invulnerability, Gilgamesh strikes him. After being punched in the face, he pleads to be let go. He first addresses Utu, lamenting that he never knew his parents and was instead raised by the sun god himself and by the mountains, and then Gilgamesh, who at first takes pity on him. He asks Enkidu if he agrees to let Humbaba go, but he rejects this proposal. Humbaba turns towards him, and complains that he has no place to advise on such matters because he is only a servant:

In response, Enkidu cuts his throat. This constitutes a reversal, as through the earlier sections of the story he was meant to act as a voice of reason, advising Gilgamesh to act cautiously. He then cuts off his head and places it in a leather bag. The protagonists take their trophy to the god Enlil, angering him, possibly because he finds the abuse of Humbaba’s trust unacceptable. He states that Gilgamesh should have treated him with respect, and that they both deserved to be similarly honored. However, neither Gilgamesh or Enkidu are punished for their actions in the end. Enlil subsequently redistributes Humbaba’s auras:

One of the copies might mention Humbaba in the closing formulaic doxology alongside Gilgamesh and Enkidu, which would indicate a degree of veneration, though the restoration of the name is uncertain and it has been proposed that the goddess Nisaba was meant instead.

The plot of version B is largely analogous. It is substantially shorter than version A, and it is often proposed that it is more archaic, though the available copies of both are contemporaneous with each other. A difference between the plots of the two versions occurs after the heroes wake up after being stunned by Humbaba’s aura: in version B Gilgamesh doubts his ability, and invokes the god Enki to help him, which the latter does by apparently providing the instructions for tricking Humbaba through Enkidu, enabling the rest of the events to unfold similarly. However, only the footwear is mentioned among the offered gifts. The ending of version B is not preserved, but it is sometimes argued that Humbaba was spared in it. 

The defeat of Humbaba is also mentioned as one of the great deeds of Gilgamesh in &quot;Bilgames’ Death&quot;, another of the early standalone Gilgamesh narratives.

===&quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;===
A number of the early compositions about Gilgamesh were eventually adapted into the form of a singular epic, possibly either during the reign of Rim-Sîn I of Larsa or Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna of Babylon. The Humbaba narrative was among them, though the version known from the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is not a direct translation of the Sumerian texts, but rather an original composition influenced by them. As an explanation the existence of an independent Akkadian account of the battle between Humbaba and the heroes, later incorporated into the &quot;Epic&quot;, has been proposed by Daniel E. Fleming and Sara J. Milstein.

====Old Babylonian version====
The incorporation of Humbaba into the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is already attested in the Old Babylonian period. Multiple known copies preserve the section focused on Gilgamesh’s journey to the cedar forest and on the encounter with its inhabitant. In contrast with the older Humbaba narratives, where he lives in the east, in the Old Babylonian version of the &quot;Epic&quot; he becomes a denizen of the west. Individual copies make references to the cedar forest being located in northern Syria or in its proximity, with direct references to Sirion and Lebanon, or alternatively Ebla and lands inhabited by Amorites. The change presumably reflected a different geopolitical situation, with closer links developing between Mesopotamia and western peoples and states in the Middle Euphrates and Khabur areas. Another possibility is that the change was influenced by the traditions focused on legendary deeds of the kings of the Akkadian Empire, as Naram-Sin was famed for seeking cedars in the Amanus Mountains in the west. According to Andrew R. George the mention of Ebla in particular supports the latter assumption, as this toponym also appears in literary texts about Naram-Sin and his predecessor Sargon.

Humbaba is first mentioned when Gilgamesh proposes an expedition to his forest to brighten the mood of Enkidu. In contrast with older narratives, he is apparently well known to the inhabitants of Uruk, rather than an unexpected encountered in the forest without prior notice. He is described as a fearsome figure with a strange face by the elders of Uruk, while Enkidu states that “everything is altered” about his appearance. However, there is no indication that he was necessarily larger than a human, and his power similarly as in earlier texts derives from his auras, here designated by the Akkadian words &quot;melammū&quot;. In contrast with the Sumerian narratives, they do not render him invulnerable, but the Akkadian version provides him with a new power instead: his voice has supernatural properties, with the copy of the epic presently in the Yale Babylonian Collection stating that &quot;his voice is the Deluge, his mouth is fire, his breath is death&quot; and a fragment from Tell Ishchali attributing the formation of Sirion and Lebanon to his roar. Another new addition is a reference to the possibility of defeating him with the help of divine forces of Shamash and Lugalbanda. He is also explicitly identified as a guardian of the forest, and his presence requires specific precautions. Enkidu also already encountered him in the past, and tells Gilgamesh that he familiarized himself with him while still roaming the wilderness. He highlights that he is a dangerous adversary, and additionally states that the cedar forest where he resides is also guarded by the god Wer:

Andrew R. George assumes that Wer was nominally the ruler of the forest, and appointed Humbaba as his second in command, with Enlil only being responsible for confirming this decision. Daniel Fleming and Sara J. Milstein instead argue that Wer should be interpreted as a figure directly identified with Humbaba in this context instead. 

The elders of Uruk also warn Gilgamesh about Humbaba, but he rejects the pleas and embarks on the journey to the cedar forest alongside Enkidu. The surviving copy of this section on the Yale tablet breaks off before the confrontation with Humbaba occurs. However, further details are provided by other, shorter fragments, which indicate that during the journey Gilgamesh had a number of dreams foretelling his confrontation with Humbaba, in which the guardian of the cedar forest appears in various symbolic non-anthropomorphic guises meant to highlight his power: as an avalanche, a thunderstorm, an Anzû bird and a wild bull. The dreams differ slightly between known copies. They might either originate in an earlier textual source which has yet to be discovered or oral tradition, or constitute an invention of the compilers of the epic. While no known sources describe the battle between Humbaba and Gilgamesh, a fragment from Tell Harmal seemingly does detail his submission, and might indicate that in this version he knew about his incoming defeat due to a dream vision sent by Shamash. A reference to his death occurs on a tablet from Tell Ishchali, and possibly on an unprovenanced one presently held in Baghdad, though the accounts differ and the latter might instead describe the fate of an unidentified figure belonging to his household. The former indicates that his demise was accompanied by an earthquake.

====Standard Babylonian version====

After the Old Babylonian period a new version of the epic referred to as “Standard Babylonian” or as the “Twelve Tablet Edition” emerged. Neo-Assyrian sources attribute this version of the Epic to the scribe Sin-leqa-unninni, who likely lived in the Kassite period. More precise dating is difficult due to small number of known fragments dated to the times between the Old Babylonian epic and the new canonical edition, though it can be assumed that it cannot be more recent than 1150 BCE due to the absence of references to either Marduk or Assur, the main Mesopotamian gods in the first millennium BCE. The Humbaba narrative occupies the fifth tablet, with copies recovered from Nineveh (Neo-Assyrian) and Uruk (Late Babylonian). Furthermore, in 2011 the Sulaymaniyah Museum acquired another example, dated to the Neo-Babylonian period and identified as a fragment of &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; by Farouk Al-Rawi, who subsequently prepared a translation alongside Andrew R. George, with additional help from Kamal Rashid Rahim, the director of antiquities in Sulaymaniyah, Hashim Hama Abdullah, the director of the Sulaymaniyah Museum, and other staff members of the latter institution. 

In the Standard Babylonian edition, Humbaba is first mentioned when Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the cedar forest to Enkidu, similarly as in older narratives. Enkidu is initially reluctant, and describes Humbaba as a fearsome being assigned to his position by Enlil:

However, eventually the two heroes decide to embark together. While leaving, Gilgamesh mentions Humbaba announcing his plans to the inhabitants of Uruk:

After a long journey Gilgamesh and Enkidu reach the cedar forest. After entering it, they hear Humbaba’s roar, which compared to the voice of Adad, the Mesopotamian weather god. A detailed description of his dwelling is preserved on the Sulaymaniyah copy, and constitutes one of the only known passages in Mesopotamian literature focused on landscape. It highlights the beauty of the entangled trees and states that the entire area was scented with cedar resin. Al-Rawi and George note that in light of the following passage, Humbaba himself is portrayed not as a “barbarian ogre”, but rather as a foreign ruler enjoying music in his court much like how a Babylonian king would, though the musicians entertaining him are animals rather than humans, reflecting a motif well attested in Mesopotamian art:

In a broken passage, Humbaba learns about the arrival of intruders in his forest, seemingly guesses that one of them must be Enkidu, who he already met in the past, and possibly expresses joy about their reunion. After a lacuna, the story resumes after the confrontation between the protagonists and Humbaba has already begun. The latter criticizes Gilgamesh for coming to his forest, declaring that he was following the “advice of an idiot fellow”. He also insults Enkidu, calling him “spawn of a fish, who knew no father, hatchling of terrapin and turtle”, highlights that he “sucked no mother&#x27;s milk”, referencing the unusual circumstances of his birth and early life; the second insult clarifies the purpose of the first, as the animals mentioned are not mammals and do not consume milk in infancy. He once again remarks that he already met Enkidu in the past, insinuates that bringing Gilgamesh to his forest constitutes treachery, and promises to kill the latter and feed him to carrion birds. Nathan Wasserman points out that since the confrontation between the heroes and Humbaba takes place after Enkidu already became close to Gilgamesh and has been adopted by Ninsun, the insults in addition to targeting what can be assumed to be his vulnerable spot also undermine his newly acquired status as a member of Gilgamesh&#x27;s family. After Humbaba&#x27;s speech, Gilgamesh loses his bravado and doubts if he can succeed, but Enkidu encourages him to not give up and the battle begins, with the ferocity of the three participants splitting the mountain apart. It continues until Shamash sends thirteen winds to tilt the scales in favor of Gilgamesh. He earlier prepared them at the request of Gilgamesh&#x27;s mother, Ninsun. Humbaba is immobilized and blinded, and starts to beg for his life. He praises Gilgamesh, highlighting his descent from Ninsun, and offers that if kept alive, he will guard the forest on his behalf. However, Enkidu urges him to ignore his pleas. Wasserman argues that while he did not respond to Humbaba&#x27;s insults in the earlier section of the text, it can be assumed that his choice in this passage was likely triggered by them. Humbaba tries to ask him to change his mind, but he is ignored once again. Enkidu instead urges Gilgamesh to kill him quickly to avoid the anger of the gods who might hear about their actions, singling out Enlil and Shamash in particular. Humbaba&#x27;s reaction is not fully preserved, but it apparently angers Enkidu, who once again tells Gilgamesh to kill him. Humbaba curses his captors in response:

This prompts Enkidu to urge Gilgamesh to act yet again, this time successfully. Gilgamesh pulls out a dagger and stabs Humbaba in the neck. Enkidu then eviscerates him and pulls out his teeth; it has been suggested that the passage draws inspiration from imagery associated with elephant hunts, historically performed in Syria by both Mesopotamian and Egyptian rulers, and that the teeth might specifically be elephant-like tusks. Al-Rawi and George note that while it was already known before the discovery of the Sulaymaniyah copy that the heroes are aware that the slaying of Humbaba would be an affront of the gods, which presumably indicates it was immoral from the point of view of the compilers, the passage highlighting this is better preserved in it, revealing that after Humbaba’s death Enkidu suddenly laments that their actions “have reduced the forest to a wasteland” and fearfully imagines Enlil questioning them. The same tablet indicates that afterwards the heroes decide to get rid of the only witnesses of the battle, the seven sons of Humbaba, apparently an otherwise unattested personification of his auras, partially tree-like and partially comparable to demons. Al-Rawi and George point out the similarity between this passage and references to the seven sons of Enmesharra, a primordial deity similarly killed alongside his offspring, possibly in order to guarantee the creation of circumstances favorable to mankind. This scene seemingly reflects the perception of Humbaba as an evil force who had to be vanquished, present elsewhere in the epic, rather than the speech directly preceding it, which the translators compare to the actions a murderer rapidly coming up with a justification for the act by blaming the victim, which according to their judgment adds “to the poem’s reputation for insight into the human condition” and marks the poet behind it as a “shrewd observer of the human mind”. 

Subsequently Enkidu suggests to Gilgamesh that they should fashion a great door from the cedars to offer it to Enlil to avoid his wrath. They decide to transport it to Nippur to present it to this god in his temple Ekur. They also take the head of Humbaba with them. Frans Wiggermann suggests that it was affixed somewhere in the Ekur as a trophy. Daniel Schwmer in a more recent publication notes that it is not impossible this interpretation is correct, but states that the traces of the passage which would have to allude to this event do not support such a restoration of the text of the epic, making the fate of Humbaba’s head impossible to ascertain. It plays no further role in the narrative. Humbaba is nonetheless mentioned again when Enkidu relays the dream he had in which the gods judged his actions and despite the pleas of Shamash declared he has to die because of the role he played in the deaths of the guardian of the cedar forest and the Bull of Heaven, apparently with nearly immediate effect. Humbaba’s curse thus comes true. His demise is also mentioned by Gilgamesh when he introduces himself to the alewife Siduri.

====Hittite and Hurrian adaptations====
Myths about Gilgamesh were adopted by Hurrians and Hittites. Both Hurrian and Hittite adaptations and circulation of Akkadian texts are attested. However, according to Gary Beckman, at least in Hattusa they were only used as scribal exercises and possibly as courtly entertainment. In the &quot;Catalogue des Textes Hittites&quot;, all of them are classified under entry CTH 341.

The Hittite adaptation of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, which shows a degree of Hurrian influence and uses a number of Hurrianized names, is known as the &quot;Song of Gilgamesh&quot;, though despite the title it is written in prose. It has been noted that its author seemingly showed a particular interest in the Humbaba narrative. The guardian of the cedar forest is first referenced when Gilgamesh states he would like to see him while meeting with Enkidu and a group of soldiers, seemingly serving as a replacement for the assembly of elders from the Mesopotamian original. The heroes similarly embark on the journey, cross the Mala river (Euphrates), and after sixteen days reach Humbaba’s dwelling. For unknown reasons the section of the narrative focused on Gilgamesh’s dreams about Humbaba was omitted, despite being preserved in the Akkadian version of the epic known to the Hittites. Humbaba notices Gilgamesh and Enkidu immediately after their arrival, and wonders why did they enter the forest. It is possible that the subsequent passage contains a reference to his musicians, best known from the Sulaymaniyah Museum copy of the Standard Babylonian version, which might indicate the events of tablet V of the latter version reflect an older tradition.

Humbaba spots the heroes for the second time when they start to cut down the cedars, and in anger confronts them, questioning their actions. They are then urged to kill him by the Sun god of Heaven, who unlike his Mesopotamian counterpart interacts with them directly. Humbaba then formally challenges Gilgamesh and Enkidu:

The passage finds no direct parallel in other versions, but Gary Beckman notes similar scenes are typical for myths known from Hittite archives dated to the imperial period, and compares it to the stone giant Ullikummi taunting his adversary, the Hurrian weather god Teshub, in one of the myths belonging to the &quot;Kumarbi Cycle&quot;. A description of a fight follows. It contains elements absent from the Akkadian original, namely Gilgamesh and Enkidu dragging Humbaba by the hair, as well as apparent involvement of animals referred to simply as unidentified “equids” by Mary R. Bachvarova but as “posted horses” by Beckman in a more recent treatment of the text. Gilgamesh is then temporarily incapacitated by a dust cloud and asks the Sun god of Heaven for help, receiving nine (rather than thirteen, like in the Akkadian version) winds as a result, which leads to the immobilization of Humbaba, who offers to become his slave:

However, Enkidu advises him to show no mercy. Humbaba&#x27;s death is not directly described in the surviving fragments, but it is agreed that like in other versions of the narrative, he was killed, as the event is referenced later on. When the gods discuss the deeds of Gilgamesh and Enkidu and determine the latter should be killed, the Sun god of Heaven argues in favor of sparing him as he acted on his behalf during the confrontation with Humbaba, while Anu considers this act unforgivable.

Due to state of preservation of the tablets and the still imperfect understanding of the Hurrian language, the Hurrian versions of Gilgamesh myths are impossible to fully translate, though it is agreed that the colophon of one of the fragments refers to it as “the fourth tablet of Ḫuwawa; not finished”. Mary R. Bachvarova proposes that this composition might have reflected the perception of Humbaba as a “local hero”. She argues that due to being portrayed as an inhabitant of northern Syria, he might have been an appealing character to western audiences, which in turn lead to retellings emphasizing his role. Yoram Cohen considers this proposal difficult to evaluate, though he tentatively accepts the existence of hitherto unknown western Humbaba-centric narratives as a possibility. The presumed existence of a standalone Hurrian Humbaba narrative might also support the proposal that a now lost Akkadian epic focused on the confrontation between him and Gilgamesh existed, as originally proposed by Daniel E. Fleming and Sara J. Milstein. The surviving fragments presumably do not constitute a direct adaptation of any Mesopotamian work, and according to Beckman can instead be compared to the incorporation of Mesopotamian motifs into the myths of Hurrian origin focused on Kumarbi. One of the fragments involves a woman pleading for the life of another, unnamed character, possibly Humbaba; while she is designated by the word &quot;šiduri&quot;, meaning “young woman” in Hurrian, it is assumed that she does not correspond to the barmaid Siduri, who instead bears the name Nahmizule in the Hurrian adaptation and some of the Hittite fragments influenced by it. It is however possible that in another passage Gilgamesh recollects the confrontation with Humbaba to the latter character. While the ending is not preserved, Bachvarova speculates that Humbaba might have either survived his meeting with Gilgamesh or Enkidu, or that his death was presented as a tragic event.

==Other textual sources==
Humbaba is also attested in a number of textual sources other than the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and its forerunners. He is referenced in the so-called &quot;Ballad of Early Rulers&quot;. This text is known from Mesopotamia, as well as from Ugarit and Emar, and constitutes an example of so-called “wisdom literature”. The line mentioning him is preserved in multiple copies of the text:

It seemingly reflects a tradition in which he did not die after his confrontation with Gilgamesh. The text of the &quot;Ballad of Early Rulers&quot; itself is, as argued by Bendt Alster, a drinking song-like composition which brings up legendary ancient rulers as a pretext to explain the need to enjoy the present. It references other works in a seemingly humorous context, with the message possibly being comparable to the later &quot;carpe diem&quot; motif. In addition to Humbaba it also mentions Alulim, Etana, Gilgamesh, Ziusudra, Enkidu, Bazi and Zizi. Presumably the large number of literary allusions was meant to make the composition entertaining for its expected audience, namely scribes well versed in the canon of Mesopotamian literature.

Multiple omens alluding to Humbaba are known from Mesopotamian omen compendiums, and based on the frequent use of the spelling Ḫuwawa in this context it assumed they reflect a tradition originating in the Old Babylonian period. They typically pertain to the appearance of both adult and newborn humans as well as newborn lambs, considered comparable to that of the mythical figure due to the presence of a bulbous nose and large eyes. Additionally, the entrails of sacrificial animals used in hepatoscopy could be compared to Humbaba’s face, and a depiction of him representing his face as resembling the intestines of a sheep is known. 

A praise hymn dedicated to Shulgi, referred to as &quot;Shulgi O&quot; according to the ETCSL naming system, might allude to a tradition in which Gilgamesh captured Humbaba and brought him back to Uruk, with the reference to “your captured hero” (&quot;ur-sag dab5-ba-zu&quot;) sometimes interpreted as a reference to the monster. This phrase is better attested as a title of various enemies of Ninurta and presumably indicates that after their defeat they were displayed as trophies.

A prayer to Dumuzi imploring him to hand over the petitioner’s tormentors to another deity possibly casts Humbaba in the latter role, though it is also possible the deity meant is Lumma or Humban. According to Gianni Marchesi, Lumma was most likely present in the original version of the text, while the author of one of the two known Assyrian copies, unfamiliar with this god, replaced him with Humbaba, despite the latter not being attested in the roles of a “gendarme-demon” or underworld deity unlike the former. 

==Visual arts==
Humbaba was commonly depicted in Mesopotamian art in the Old Babylonian period. However, often only his face was shown. Such depictions had an apotropaic purpose. An example has been identified as a decoration of the gate of an Old Babylonian temple excavated in Tell al-Rimah. Ornamental heads of Humbaba are also mentioned in multiple administrative texts from Mari and in a list of jewelry from Qatna. Multiple works of art showing the confrontation between Humbaba and Gilgamesh and Enkidu are also known, including clay plaques and cylinder seals from various locations in Mesopotamia and neighboring areas, and possibly a statue from the Louvre collection showing a hero standing on the head resembling these identified as depictions of Humbaba. While it can be assumed that depictions from Nuzi or from various Mitanni sites strictly reflect the Mesopotamian tradition, it is not certain if artists in western Iran or in Anatolia were necessarily using the motif in its original context, and might have instead reinterpreted it as a representation of unidentified local myths instead.

In later periods, the depictions of Humbaba are less frequent. Frans Wiggermann argues that he largely disappeared from visual arts after the Bronze Age, but a relief from Tell Halaf is presumed to be a first millennium BCE example, and according to Gary Beckman representations of Humbaba’s defeat at the hands of Gilgamesh and Enkidu have been identified from as late as the Achaemenid period. Wilfred G. Lambert cited a seal from Ur from this period as the youngest known work of art showing this scene he was aware of, but it has alternatively been interpreted as a nude woman playing with cupids. A possible late depiction of the face of Humbaba has been identified in a tomb in Petra, which was assigned the number 649 during excavations, though similar works of art from Mesopotamia are limited to the Old Babylonian period. Similar faces are also known from tombs from another Nabataean side, Medain Saleh. In neither case the identification is certain. Judith McKenzie noted that if accepted, Humbaba’s presence in Nabataean art would open the question whether Nabateans were familiar with the myths involving him.

Frans Wiggermann has suggested that another Mesopotamian demon, Pazuzu, can be considered a metaphorical “successor” of Humbaba, as both were commonly depicted in the form of disembodied heads and had similar apotropaic functions. He highlights that a link between the head of Humbaba and the personified west wind, another possible forerunner of Pazuzu, is present in art, with the two sometimes appearing together; both of them were also believed to reside in western mountains. Eckhart Frahm takes a more cautious position than Wiggermann, and notes that while the heads of Humbaba and Pazuzu did seemingly fulfill the same function, there is little direct iconographic overlap between the two. Several other competing theories regarding the origin of Pazuzu can be found in Assyriological literature; Frahm notes it is possible the name derived from the sequence Bazi-Zizi, the names of two pre-Sargonic kings of Mari from the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. The view that Pazuzu might have been modeled on the Egyptian god Bes also found a degree of support among researchers, starting with Anthony Green in the 1980s.

Another possible successor of Humbaba is a lahmu-like figure shown as a vanquished adversary of the gods on seals from the first millennium BCE.

==Later relevance==
===Greek sources===

It is assumed that the iconography of Humbaba influenced the image of Greek gorgons. Apotropaic functions are similarly attested for depictions of their heads. Additionally, works of art showing Perseus killing Medusa with Athena’s help are considered a Greek adaptation of the Mesopotamian motif of Humbaba being killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu. It is a matter of dispute if the art motif was transmitted alongside the myth it was rooted in. It is also unknown whether Greeks adopted a foreign motif to represent a preexisting local myth, or if either the imported art motif or the myth it was derived from influenced the formation of the story of Perseus. 

===&quot;Book of Giants&quot;===
One of the eponymous giants in the &quot;Book of Giants&quot;, variously referred to as Ḥôbabiš, Ḥôbabis or Ḥōbāīš, is assumed to be derived from Mesopotamian Humbaba. The connection was first noted by Józef Milik. He is attested both in the Aramaic version from Qumran, which reflects an older Jewish tradition, and in a later Michaean adaptation written in Middle Persian, found in Turfan. While the same sources also preserve the name of Gilgamesh, reinterpreted as an evil giant, there is no indication that their compilers were familiar with the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, and they might have been aware of their names thanks to other cuneiform texts still in circulation in the first millennium BCE (for example omen compendiums) or from derived oral traditions. Yoram Cohen suggests that they might have been borrowed from an unknown western tradition about Humbaba. Matthew Goff proposed the author might have had indirect knowledge of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; which relied on information originally brought westwards by returning members of an eastern diaspora. The surviving sections do not indicate that either name is present in a context resembling the earlier Humbaba narratives, and according to Andrew R. George it is safe to say that both are only “incidental characters in a story that revolves around other giants and is unrelated to any episode of the Gilgamesh epic”. During an assembly held by giants, one of them, ‘Ohyah, informs them about “what &quot;glgms&quot; (Gilgamesh) has said to him, and what Ḥôbabis yelled”; the topic of this message is unknown, but apparently it inspired joy in the gathered crowd. 

The form of Humbaba’s name preserved in the &quot;Book of Giants&quot; was seemingly also known to a number of later Arab writers, as indicated by a reference to a Manichaean “spirit of darkness” named Hummāmah in an Islamic polemic and to the presence of presumed corrupt forms of the name in incantations from the fifteenth century showing a degree of influence from Manichaeism, written by Al-Suyūṭī. 

===Disputed or disproved proposals===
Attempts to connect Humbaba with the biblical Kenite Hobab are considered baseless, and the latter name is more likely to be derived from one of two unrelated Hebrew roots, either &quot;ḫbb&quot; (&quot;cunning&quot;) or &quot;ḥbb&quot; (&quot;kindness&quot;).

While accepted in older scholarship, a connection between Humbaba and Kombabos, a figure known from the writings of Lucian of Samosata, is not considered likely. The phonetic similarity between the names is most likely accidental, and the proposal relies on assumption that Kombabos is an unlikely amalgamation of Gilgamesh and Enkidu bearing a name derived from Humbaba’s. 

It has also been proposed that a scene in the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres relaying how the mother of Jannes had a dream in which a sinner enters paradise as an intruder to fell a cypress tree reflects the Humbaba narratives, but this view is not regarded as plausible.

<text>The edimmu, read incorrectly sometimes as ekimmu, were a type of utukku in the Mesopotamian religion of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia, similar in nature to the preta of the Hindu religions or the jiangshi of Chinese mythology. They were envisioned as the ghosts of those who were not buried properly. They were considered vengeful toward the living and might possess people if they did not respect certain taboos, such as the prohibition against eating ox meat. They were thought to cause disease and inspire criminal behavior in the living, but could sometimes be appeased by funeral repasts or libations. The edimmu were also thought to be completely or nearly incorporeal, &quot;wind&quot; spirits that sucked the life out of the susceptible and the sleeping (most commonly the young).

== In modern fiction ==
===Games===
* The magazine &quot;Dragon&quot; #25 (May 1979) includes &quot;ekimmu&quot; in an article which describes them as a form of a vampire and give stats for them to use for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. They are described as being able to stay invisible, even while they are attacking.
* The 1990 role-playing game &quot;Night Life&quot; offers Ekimmu as an NPC Race (and an optional selection for the player character&#x27;s undead race selection at the start of the game). They are described as being created &quot;when someone vows to look after the grave of the deceased and then fails to.&quot;
* The &quot;ekimmas&quot; are a species of vampires in the 2015 game &quot;The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt&quot;. They are depicted as large bat-like bipedal creatures that can turn partially invisible and haunt dungeons and ruins.
* Edimmus are monsters featured in the videogame RuneScape.

===Graphic novel===

* In Hellblazer volume 22, Constantine is given the skin of a 200-year old ekimmu by another ekimmu named Julian who has taken on the appearance of a pre-teen British schoolgirl. He heats it up and makes a salve to rub on the scabs of a skin condition he gets because of something which happened in Liverpool. It is said to be similar to an opiate and helps the pain.

<doc id="247185" wikidata="Q2050255" url="?curid=247185" title="Akalat">
<text>The akalats (stressed on the second syllable) are medium-sized insectivorous birds in the genus Sheppardia. They were formerly placed in the thrush family, Turdidae, but are more often now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae.

The genus contains 11 Sub-Saharan forest-dwelling species:

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The genus &quot;Sheppardia&quot; was introduced in 1909 by the South African ornithologist Alwin Karl Haagner with the East coast akalat (&quot;Sheppardia gunningi&quot;) as the type species. The name of the genus was chosen to honour the collector and farmer P. A. Sheppard. 

Richard Bowdler Sharpe, who had never visited Africa, associated the akalats, in their Bulu appellation, with birds of &quot;different kinds&quot; occurring in the forest understorey. His main collector in West Africa, George L. Bates, denoted them more specifically as &quot;little members of the genus &quot;Turdinus&quot;, which are called in Fang and Bulu &quot;Akalat&quot;...&quot;. The latter genus denoted a group of Old World babblers, currently classed as near-babblers in the genus &quot;Illadopsis&quot;.

David Armitage Bannerman&#x27;s volumes on West African birds, published from 1930 through to 1951, became well-established reference works for the region, and retained the name akalat for &quot;Trichastoma&quot;, which is &quot;Illadopsis&quot;. Reichenow however classed &quot;Turdinus batesi&quot; as an &quot;Alethe&quot;, then in the &quot;Turdidae&quot; (thrushes and flycatchers), followed by Jackson and Sclater in 1938 who applied it to &quot;Sheppardia&quot; specifically. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1953, 1955) and Williams (1963 - 1980s) retained their usage. In 1964 the name was still recorded as denoting both groups, namely the &quot;Malococincla&quot;, i.e. &quot;Illadopsis&quot; near-babblers in West Africa, and the &quot;Sheppardia&quot; chats in East African literature, though the latter convention prevailed in modern times.

Yet the calls of the aforementioned species only doubtfully agree with the akalat&#x27;s appellation as an omen of death. It is recorded that the akalat&#x27;s forest song, respectively referred to as &quot;boofio&quot; and &quot;woofio&quot; by the Bulu and Ntumu peoples, is believed by them to predict the death of a near parent who bids them farewell with this song.

<doc id="247196" wikidata="Q13411011" url="?curid=247196" title="Sex-positive movement">
<text>The sex-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that seeks to change cultural attitudes and norms around sexuality, promoting the recognition of sexuality (in the countless forms of expression) as a natural and healthy part of the human experience and emphasizing the importance of personal sovereignty, safer sex practices, and consensual sex (free from violence or coercion). It is based on the idea that &quot;sexuality is an important part of the human experience and it deserves respect.&quot; Although the definition of the term greatly varies among those involved in the movement, its central notion is &quot;openness to a variety of sexual orientations, interests (or lack thereof), identities and expressions.&quot; The sex-positive movement also advocates for comprehensive sex education and safe sex as part of its campaign. The movement generally makes no moral distinctions among types of sexual activities, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.

==Overview==
The terms and concepts of &quot;sex-positive&quot; (German: ) (or, alternately &quot;sex-affirmative&quot; ()) and &quot;sex-negative&quot; () are generally attributed to Wilhelm Reich. His hypothesis was that some societies view the sexual expression as essentially good and healthy, while others have a generally negative view of sexuality and seek to repress and control libido. Other terms used to describe this concept include &quot;pro-sex&quot; or &quot;pro-sexuality&quot;.

The sex-positive movement does not, in general, make moral or ethical distinctions between heterosexual or homosexual sex, or masturbation, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference. Other sex-positive positions include acceptance of BDSM and polyamory as well as asexuality.

Some sex-positive theorists have analyzed sex-positivity in terms of the intersection of race/culture, gender, sexuality, class, nationality, and spirituality. Because of the vastness of the sex-positivity movement, it has been challenging for people to reach an agreed-upon definition of the term &quot;sex-positivity&quot;. Several definitions of sex-positivity have been offered by sexologist Carol Queen:

&quot;Sex-positive&quot;, a term that&#x27;s coming into cultural awareness, isn&#x27;t a dippy love-child celebration of orgone – it&#x27;s a simple yet radical affirmation that we each grow our own passions on a different medium, that instead of having two or three or even half a dozen sexual orientations, we should be thinking in terms of millions. &quot;Sex-positive&quot; respects each of our unique sexual profiles, even as we acknowledge that some of us have been damaged by a culture that tries to eradicate sexual differences and possibilities.

It&#x27;s the cultural philosophy that understands sexuality as a positive force in one&#x27;s life, and it can, of course, be contrasted with sex-negativity, which sees sex as problematic, disruptive, and dangerous. Sex-positivity allows for and in fact celebrates sexual diversity, differing desires and relationships structures, and individual choices based on consent.

==History==
In general use, the term &quot;sexual liberation&quot; is used to describe a socio-political movement, witnessed from the 1960s into the 1970s. However, the term has been used at least since the late 1920s and is often attributed as being influenced by Freud&#x27;s writing on sexual liberation and psychosexual issues, as well as Wilhelm Reich, who originally coined the term.

During the 1960s, a shift in the ways people thought about sexuality began to take place, heralding a period of de-conditioning in some circles away from old world antecedents, and developing new codes of sexual behavior, many of which have since been integrated into the mainstream.

The 1960s also heralded a new culture of &quot;free love&quot; with millions of young people embracing the hippie ethos and preaching the power of love and the beauty of sex as a natural part of ordinary life. Hippies believed that sex and sexuality were natural biological phenomena that should be neither denied nor repressed. Changes in attitudes reflected a perception that traditional views on sexuality were both hypocritical and male-chauvinistic.

Sexual liberalization heralded a new ethos in experimenting with open sex in and outside of marriage, contraception and the pill, public nudity, gay liberation, legalized abortion, interracial marriage, a return to natural childbirth, women&#x27;s rights, and feminism.

Historian David Allyn argues that the sexual revolution was a time of &quot;coming-out&quot;: about premarital sex, masturbation, erotic fantasies, pornography use, and sexuality.

The term &quot;sex-positive&quot; first came into use in the United States in the late 1990s with the founding of the Center for Sex and Culture in San Francisco, California, and The Center for Sex Positive Culture in Seattle, Washington. In 2009, Sex Positive World began in Portland, Oregon. , there are more than sixteen chapters of the nonprofit, in five countries.

== Sex-positive feminism ==
Sex-positive feminism, also known as pro-sex feminism, sex-radical feminism, or sexually liberal feminism, is a movement that began in the early 1980s. In the 1970s, the second-wave feminist movement emerged, characterized by its opposition to pornography, sex work, and BDSM, known and referred to as sex-negative or antiporn viewpoints.

Some became involved in the sex-positive feminist movement in response to efforts by anti-pornography feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon and Dorchen Leidholdt, to put pornography at the center of a feminist explanation of women&#x27;s oppression. Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan held the belief as anti-pornography feminists that the degradation and objectification of women&#x27;s bodies fostered ideas of sexual violence and assault. This period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the &quot;Feminist Sex Wars&quot;. Other sex-positive feminists became involved, not in opposition to other feminists, but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality. Some authors who have advocated sex-positive feminism include Erika Lust, Ellen Willis, Susie Bright, Patrick Califia, Gayle Rubin, Carol Queen, Avedon Carol, Tristan Taormino, Diana Cage, Nina Hartley, Amia Srinivasan, Mireille Miller-Young, and Betty Dodson.

Sex-positive feminism gives attention and acknowledges the importance of women&#x27;s right to explore their bodies, sexual desire, and considers that sexual violence does not have to prevent the vindication of female desire. This movement demands the preservation of freedom and is against norms that are present in the sexual sphere. It also encourages and demands respect for variety and sexual dissidence without allowing itself to be harmed by intense anti-sex pressure from critics.

Sex-positive feminism affirms that the discourse on women&#x27;s sexual pleasure is silenced and marginalized in today&#x27;s world. Suppressing sexual dialogue with the supposed purpose of protecting women will only make them appear, according to this perspective, as the weaker sex. Women could have difficulty defending themselves with the classification as victims. Over time, women have been classified as sexually passive, while men are recognized as sexually aggressive, so intercourse is considered an activity in which women &quot;submit&quot; to men&#x27;s desire. Another factor that continues to minimize female desire is the lack of consensus and research on it, a product of the social repression that women have had to endure over the centuries, which has led to prejudices and generalizations.

Shere Hite, a sex educator and feminist, challenged misconceptions about female sexuality, and supported feminine sexual liberation and the right for individuals to freely express and explore their sexuality without judgement or repression. As demonstrated in her work, &quot;The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality&quot; (1976), she countered Freudian beliefs asserting that women were capable to experiencing sexual pleasure independently, without the need for intercourse. However, Hite faced antifeminist backlash due to her statistical methods of collecting data, demonstrating bias, and therefore the book became largely controversial and threatening to certain parties of men.

The sexual hierarchy system places heterosexuality, marriage and procreation at the top, which causes many women to fear the sexual system that predominates in today&#x27;s world. Pleasure and sexuality are human rights that have been subjugated by an old-fashioned patriarchal social construction. Pro-sex feminism endeavors to cultivate sexuality as a site of political resistance. By using the &quot;pleasure&quot; factor in their favor, a significant contribution to the contemporary queer theory and politics has been made by using sexual and feminist &quot;empowerment.&quot;

== Empowering perspectives ==

=== Sex-positive education for youth ===
The sex-positive movement is also concerned with the teaching of comprehensive and accurate sex education in schools. Programs such as the &quot;Abstinence Education Grant Program (AEGP)&quot; teach abstinence as the healthy way to approach one&#x27;s sexual desires and to avoid sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. However, in May 2021, The Real Education and Access for Healthy Youth Act (REAHYA) introduced federal grants aimed to encompass truthful, and inclusive sex education for the youth. It seeks to put an end to federal funding for the Title V state grant program, which promotes the abstinence-until-marriage ideology, which could be detrimental for early education. The A-H guidelines from Title V of the Social Security Act convey a distinct perspective that places the notion that engaging in sexual activity exclusively within the context of marriage is the only acceptable behavior (excluding LGBT individuals), supporting the abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. The movement seeks to promote a healthier view for youth to understand the open, honest, non-judgemental, accepting approach to learning and teaching about sex positivity.

=== Sex work industry ===
The sex work industry encompasses pornography, prostitution (escort services, massage parlors, and brothels), cybersex services, exotic dancing, and online nude modeling. About 40 to 42million women globally are involved in the sex work industry; however, estimates of the number of LGBT sex workers are often not accounted for. Feminist, queer, and human right scholars use the term &quot;sex work&quot; to emphasize the economic choices made when entering the sex labor industry, regardless of legal status and gender identity. The complexity of the sex work industry excludes the workers from protection provided by international, federal, and state regulations, making the rights of sex workers fundamental human rights.

Sex workers require protection against pimps and criminal syndicates who easily take advantage of their earnings, and also require protection from violence, discrimination, social marginalization, and easier access to healthcare and housing services. Sex workers are frequently subjected to criminalization, while usually the men involved, as either consumers or controllers of labor, often walk away unpunished. There is differing conversations between feminists, queer scholars, activists, and practitioner&#x27;s opinions of whether sex work should be decriminalized, legalized, and/or unionized. They all agree that the power dynamics inherent in the social constructs of gender, race, class, age, sexuality, and nationality generate economical conditions that force sex workers to operate and make a living within violently patriarchal and capitalist frameworks.

=== Consent culture ===
Sex-positive movement emphasizes and supports the importance of consent in sexual encounters. Consent is the first and most basic form of respect between people when engaging in sexual activities. The negotiation and form of communication when discussing consent is the most important aspect when promoting healthy sexual relationships. Consent culture promotes affirmative consent, encourages enthusiastic consent, and the importance of consent education to foster healthy and respectful sexual relations. Consent gives a way to articulate and legitimize our moral judgments in public.

Affirmative consent describes the explicit, informed, and voluntary assent to engage in sexual behavior. Anyone engaging in sexual interactions is responsible for making sure that the other party or parties have given their direct consent without hesitation. Absence of protest, words, or action does not mean consent, and silence will never be a form of consent. There should be no expectation of protest or opposition.

A positive expression of consent is the main focus of enthusiastic consent. Invoking enthusiastic consent entails focusing on the presence of a &quot;yes&quot; as opposed to the absence of a &quot;no.&quot; It can be communicated vocally or nonverbally using encouraging body language. These include nodding, maintaining eye contact, and smiling, as examples of body language. It is significant to remember that while these may imply consent, they do not represent explicit affirmative consent, always get verbal confirmation. The key to maintaining a healthy sexual relationship and consent is to regularly check in with one&#x27;s partner or partners to make sure they are comfortable and that their opinions have not changed.

=== Intersectionality ===
Intersectionality within the sex-positive movement strives to recognize complex identities, inclusiveness, regardless of social categories of gender, class, race, and sexuality. It lacks the inclusion of race and ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and status. The sex-positive movement strives to move towards incorporating cultural diversity, and taking into account the variety in sexual practices as well as sexual minorities and other marginalized or oppressed identities. Positive sexuality compasses the well-being and happiness of an individual, individuality in sexuality, embracing multiple ways of knowing and learning, professional ethics, open and honest communication, peacemaking, while being applicable to all levels of social structure.

Sex-positivity was established and rooted from a Western perspective. Much of the current sex-positive frameworks is concentrated on the educated, industrialized, prosperous, and democratic populations, neglecting the idea of intersectionality and marginalized groups.

== Criticism ==
In opposition, some feminists believe sex-positivity perceives disadvantage in women but makes them easier to oppress. A large religious—particularly Abrahamic—conservative opposition to sex-positivity sees human sexuality as a destructive force except under the contract of a marriage. Sexual acts are ranked hierarchically, with marital heterosexuality at the top of the hierarchy and masturbation, homosexuality, and other sexualities that deviate from societal expectations closer to the bottom. Medicine and psychiatry are said to have also contributed to sex-negativity, as they may designate some forms of sexuality that appear on the bottom of this hierarchy as being pathological (see mental illness).

Multiple feminists, such as Verkerk, Glick, and Bauer have criticized iterations of sex-positivity due to concerns about its effectiveness in challenging patriarchal norms. These feminists insist they are &quot;sex-critical&quot; rather than &quot;sex-negative&quot;. Scholar, Verkerk, acknowledges this by stating that &quot;there are both harmful and liberating aspects of female sexual objectification and an accurate account of it must consider both&quot;. Critics also take issue with the commodification of sexuality. Women are told both to invest in western standards of beauty and sexualization while also becoming &quot;consumable objects themselves.&quot; Sex-positive feminism has also been criticized for its emphasis on defeating the patriarchal gender norms through personal life choices, &quot;rather than to dismantle, critique, expose, or challenge systematic discrimination and violence.&quot;
The SlutWalk has received criticism of its efficacy as an activist event. SlutWalk&#x27;s purpose was to reclaim the word &quot;slut&quot; and counteract victim-blaming. Despite the aim of the slut-walk, critics point out that the word &quot;slut&quot; had not been reclaimed. Rather, the word slut had become reified. Critics of the SlutWalk also suggest that the focus on revealing clothing &quot;ultimately displace[s] the sombre and deadly issues of rape, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and street harassment.&quot; Lastly, the SlutWalk received criticism for lack of consideration of the hyper-sexualization that women of colour face. Black Women&#x27;s Blueprint penned an open letter to the slut-walk explaining that Black women cannot &quot;afford to label&quot; themselves as those in the slut-walk do.

== In the 21st century ==
Since the early 2000s, the sex-positivity movement has continued to move closer into the mainstream. The advent of social media has made the sex-positivity movement more accessible by giving advocates of the movement platforms to promote their beliefs to a wide audience of followers. By extending the reach of the movement, sex-positivity has come to be inclusive of all sorts of sex and sexuality. Shaming has become an area of particular interest within the sex-positivity movement, encouraging people to be more open and accepting of the different experiences people have with sex and sexuality. Slut-shaming, prude-shaming and kink-shaming have all been challenged by the sex-positivity movement in an effort to allow all people to feel supported by and included in the movement.

=== Online sex-positive communities ===
Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Tumblr have curated large communities of sex-positive groups, inviting and creating easily accessible places for people to join. Additionally, there has been an exponential increase in sex-positive fetish digital apps promoting BDSM kink such as Ferly, Feeld, Bloom now Plura, and #open. Events held annually like the Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, Folsom Street Fair, Sexpo, Really Good Sex Festival, invite and promote the sex-positive community to the public, attracting tourists and media coverage from around the world.

Cybersex has become popular with the advancement of technology due to the increased accessibility to the internet. The visibility of male sexual services on the internet and websites catering male escorts has also increased due to the preference for the privacy and anonymity that cybersex offers as an online service. This has benefited the male sex industry, especially for gay social spaces that often feel discomforting in traditional settings.

=== Sex-positive parties and clubs ===
Sex-positive events are not the same as sex parties: sex is allowed but not the main focus of the event. Fetish clothing is common, which is a mandatory dress code in many cases. Such party series and clubs, e.g. Torture Garden in London, Wasteland in Amsterdam, KitKatClub, German Fetish Ball and House of Lunacy in Berlin, Freedom Fetish party and Ministry of Freedom club in Budapest.

=== Mainstream media ===
Pop culture has also played a large role in bringing the sex-positivity movement into the mainstream. Celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Amber Rose, Jessica Biel, Cameron Diaz, Taylor Swift and many others, have spoken publicly about their experiences with slut-shaming, sexuality, sexual assault, body acceptance and overall sexual health and responsibility.

In recent years, sex-positive concepts have found their way into dance clubs through sex-positive parties in cities like Berlin and Vienna. Sex-positive podcasts like You Came First With Meghan Barton Hanson, Sex with Emily, Sexology, along with social media content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, have been increasingly popular, attracting and specifically targeting a younger audience who engage in open discussions and fosters conversations about being sex-positive and personal sexual experiences.

<doc id="247198" wikidata="Q10745345" url="?curid=247198" title="Rockjumper">
<text>The rockjumpers are medium-sized insectivorous or omnivorous birds in the genus Chaetops, which constitutes the entire family Chaetopidae. The two species, the Cape rockjumper, &quot;Chaetops frenatus&quot;, and the Drakensberg rockjumper, &quot;Chaetops aurantius&quot;, are endemic residents of southern Africa. The Cape rockjumper is a resident of the West Cape and south-west East Cape, and the orange-breasted (or Drakensberg) rockjumper is distributed in the Lesotho Highlands and areas surrounding them in South Africa. The two rockjumpers have been treated as separate species but differ in size and plumage. The ranges do not overlap, but come close to doing so.
Also found in the mountain of a small town Middelburg in the eastern Cape where they are protected because they are endangered species. 

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Originally, these birds were placed in the thrushes, and they have also been placed with the Old World warblers and the babblers, but recent DNA studies indicate these birds are actually members of a basal group of oscines within the infraorder Passeri along with their sister-family the rockfowl (Picatharthidae),

Their Latin names derive from descriptions of their appearance. &quot;Frenatus&quot; refers to the &quot;bridled&quot; or black-and-white head pattern, while &quot;Aurantius&quot; refers to the orange coloration.

==Description==
These are small birds with mostly black, white, and red plumage. Both species have long, white-tipped black tails, black throats, broad white submoustachial lines and eyebrows, rufous or orange bellies and rumps, and grey and black patterned backs and wings. Females have a similar pattern to males, but duller. The iris is red and the bills and legs are black. Their wings are very small and they do not fly very often. They spend most of their lives running and jumping among rocks and grass while hunting insects.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet and feeding===
The rockjumpers feed in groups, foraging on the ground. The groups can number up to 6 birds (for Cape) and 12 birds (for Drakensberg), but the groups may also spread out quite widely during feeding. Insects are the major part of the diet, although small vertebrates are reported to be taken by Cape rockjumpers. A range of insects are taken, including caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers, beetles and flies. In addition to insects other prey include lizards and geckos, amphibians, scorpions, annelid worms and spiders.
Crows often attack the birds because they both eat similar foods, crows would traitor them until they leave the food alone .

===Breeding===
They are monogamous and pairs establish territories which are defended year round. In the Cape rockjumper the territories vary in size from . Both species employ helpers, usually the young of previous broods, to aid the breeding pair in raising the young. Nests are built out of grass on the ground (in contrast to rockfowl, which build mud nests in colonies). The clutch size is two eggs for the Cape rockjumper and two or three eggs for the Drakensberg rockjumper. Both sexes incubate the clutch for 19–21 days. Chicks fledge at 19–21 days, although they are fed by the parents and helpers for up to 4 weeks following fledge.

<text>Cossypha are small insectivorous birds, with most species called robin-chats. They were formerly in the thrush family Turdidae, but are now more often treated as part of the Old World flycatcher Muscicapidae.

These are African woodland dwelling species, but some have become adapted to sites around human habitation.

The name &quot;Cossypha&quot; for the genus was introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825. The word comes from the Classical Greek &quot;kossuphos&quot; for a blackbird or thrush.

The genus contains the following eight species:

<text>Caryophyllaceae, commonly called the pink family or carnation family, is a family of flowering plants. It is included in the dicotyledon order Caryophyllales in the APG III system, alongside 33 other families, including Amaranthaceae, Cactaceae, and Polygonaceae. It is a large family, with 81 genera and about 2,625 known species.

This cosmopolitan family of mostly herbaceous plants is best represented in temperate climates, with a few species growing on tropical mountains. Some of the more commonly known members include pinks and carnations (&quot;Dianthus&quot;), and firepink and campions (&quot;Silene&quot;). Many species are grown as ornamental plants, and some species are widespread weeds. Most species grow in the Mediterranean and bordering regions of Europe and Asia. The number of genera and species in the Southern Hemisphere is rather small, although the family does contain Antarctic pearlwort (&quot;Colobanthus quitensis&quot;), the world&#x27;s southernmost dicot, which is one of only two flowering plants found in Antarctica.

The name comes from &quot;Caryophyllus&quot;, an obsolete synonym of &quot;Dianthus&quot;.

==Description==
Despite its size and the somewhat doubtful mutual relationships, this family is rather uniform and easily recognizable.

Most are herbaceous annuals or perennials, dying off above ground each year. A few species are shrubs or small trees, such as some &quot;Acanthophyllum&quot; species. Most plants are non-succulent; i.e. having no fleshy stems or leaves. The nodes on the stem are swollen. The leaves are almost always opposite, rarely whorled. The blades are entire, petiolate, and often stipulate. These stipules are not sheath-forming.

The bisexual flowers are terminal, blooming singly or branched or forked in cymes. The inflorescence is usually dichasial at least in the lower parts, which means that in the axil of each peduncle (primary flower stalk) of the terminal flower in the cyme, two new single-flower branches sprout up on each side of and below the first flower. If the terminal flowers are absent, then this can lead to monochasia, i.e. a monoparous cyme with a single flower on each axis of the inflorescence. In the extreme, this leads to a single flower, such as in &quot;Githago&quot; or &quot;Arenaria&quot;. The flowers are regular and mostly with five petals and five sepals, but sometimes with four petals. The sepals may be free from one another or united. The petals may be entire, fringed or deeply cleft. The calyx may be cylindrically inflated, as in &quot;Silene&quot;. The stamens number five or 10 (or more rarely four or eight), and are mostly isomerous with the perianth. The superior gynoecium has two to five carpels (members of a compound pistil) and is syncarpous; i.e. with these carpels united in a compound ovary. This ovary has one chamber inside the ovary. The fruit may be a utricle with a single seed or a capsule containing several seeds.

==Systematics==

Currently, Amaranthaceae and Caryophyllaceae are sister groups and considered closely related.

Formerly, Caryophyllaceae were considered the sister family to all of the remaining members of the suborder Caryophyllineae because they have anthocyanins, and not betalain pigments. However, cladistic analyses indicate Caryophyllaceae evolved from ancestors that contained betalain, reinforcing betalain as an accurate synapomorphy of the suborder.

This family is traditionally divided in three subfamilies:
* Alsinoideae: no stipules, petals not united
* Silenoideae: no stipules, petals united
* Paronychioideae: fleshy stipules, petals separate or united

The last, however, are a basal grade of rather primitive members of this family, not closely related, but simply retaining many plesiomorphic traits. Instead of a subfamily, most ought to be treated as genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, but &quot;Corrigiola&quot; and &quot;Telephium&quot; might warrant recognition as Corrigioleae. The Alsinoideae, on the other hand, seem to form two distinct clades, perhaps less some misplaced genera. Finally, the Silenoideae appear monophyletic at least for the most part, if some of the taxa misplaced in Alsinoideae are moved there; it may be that the name Caryophylloideae would apply for the revised delimitation.

However, hybridization between many members of this family is rampant—particularly in the Silenoideae/Caryophylloideae—and some of the lineages of descent have been found to be highly complicated and do not readily yield to cladistic analysis.

<text>The shawm () is a conical bore, double-reed woodwind instrument made in Europe from the 12th century to the present day. It achieved its peak of popularity during the medieval and Renaissance periods, after which it was gradually eclipsed by the oboe family of descendant instruments in classical music. It is likely to have come to Western Europe from the Eastern Mediterranean around the time of the Crusades. Double-reed instruments similar to the shawm were long present in Southern Europe and the East, for instance the ancient Greek, and later Byzantine aulos, the closely related sorna and zurna, and the Armenian duduk.

The body of the shawm is usually turned from a single piece of wood, and terminates in a flared bell somewhat like that of a trumpet. Beginning in the 16th century, shawms were made in several sizes, from sopranino to great bass, and four- and five-part music could be played by a consort consisting entirely of shawms. All later shawms (excepting the smallest) have at least one key allowing a downward extension of the compass; the keywork is typically covered by a perforated wooden cover called the &quot;fontanelle&quot;. The bassoon-like double reed, made from the same &quot;arundo donax&quot; cane used for oboes and bassoons, is inserted directly into a socket at the top of the instrument, or in the larger types, on the end of a metal tube called the bocal. The &quot;pirouette&quot;, a small wooden attachment with a cavity in the center resembling a thimble, surrounds the lower part of the reed—this provides support for the lips and embouchure.

Since only a short portion of the reed protrudes past the pirouette, the player has only limited contact with the reed, and therefore limited control of dynamics. The shawm&#x27;s conical bore and flaring bell, combined with the style of playing dictated by the use of a pirouette, gives the instrument a piercing, trumpet-like sound, well-suited for outdoor performances.

==Etymology==

In English the name first appears in the 14th century. There were originally three main variant forms, (1) ( or ), (2) ( or , all plural forms in Middle English), and (3) (or ), each derived from a corresponding variant in Old French: , , and (the plural of ), each in turn derived from the Latin (&#x27;reed&#x27;), or its Vulgar Latin diminutive form, . Calamus, in turn, derives from Ancient Greek (kálamos), &quot;reed, cane&quot;.

(The name of a somewhat different reed instrument, the chalumeau, also shares this etymology.) The early plural forms were often mistaken for a singular, and new plurals were formed from them. The later reduction in the 15th and 16th centuries to a single syllable in forms such as &quot;schalme&quot;, &quot;shaume&quot;, &quot;shawme&quot;, and finally (in the 16th century) &quot;shawm&quot;, was probably due to this confusion of plural and singular forms.
In German the shawm is called (or for the larger members of the family —also in English in the 14th century—later corrupted to and finally in the 17th century to &quot;Pommer&quot;) This is borne out by the very similar names of many folk shawms used as traditional instruments in various European nations: in Spain, many traditional shawms with different names can be found, such as the Castilian, Aragonese, and Leonese &quot;dulzaina&quot; (sometimes called &quot;chirimía&quot;, a term that derives from the same Old French word as &quot;shawm&quot;); the Valencian and Catalan shawms (, , or &quot;gralla&quot;) or the Navarrese &quot;gaita&quot;. In Portugal there is an instrument called ; and the name of the Italian shawm is (or: , ).

However, it is also possible that the name comes from the Arabic (), a traditional oboe from Egypt, as the European shawm seems to have been developed from similar instruments brought to Europe from the Near East during the time of the Crusades. This Arabic name is itself linguistically related to many other Eastern names for the instrument: the Arabic (), the Turkish &quot;zūrnā&quot;, the Persian &quot;surnāy&quot;, the Chinese &quot;suona&quot;, the Javanese , and the Hindu or &quot;sanayi&quot;.

==Use==
By the early 16th century the brash tonality of the medieval shawm had been modulated by a narrowing of the bore and a reduction in the size of the fingerholes. This also extended the range, enabling the performer to play the notes in the second octave. Larger sizes of shawm were built, down to the great bass in B, two octaves and a major third below the soprano in D. However, the larger sizes were unwieldy, which made them somewhat rare.

The smaller sizes of shawm, chiefly the soprano, alto and sometimes the tenor, were more often coupled with the Renaissance trombone, or sackbut, and the majestic sound of this ensemble was much in demand by civic authorities. The shawm became standard equipment for town bands, or waits, who were required to herald the start of municipal functions and signal the major times of day. The shawm became so closely associated with the town waits ( in German and in Italian) that it was also known as the wait-pipe.

Before the discovery of a still shawm aboard the shipwreck of the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, instrument historians had been puzzled by references to &quot;still shawms&quot;, or &quot;soft&quot; shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms. The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene in the 16th century; the instrument found on the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; is the only surviving example. A reproduction has been made and played. Combined with a pipe and tabor, it provides a &quot;very effective bass part&quot; that would have produced &quot;rich and full sound, which would have provided excellent music for dancing on board ship&quot;.

The shawm was reserved almost exclusively for outdoor performance—for softer, indoor music, other instruments such as the crumhorn and cornamuse were preferred. These were double reed instruments fitted with a capsule that completely enclosed the reed, which softened the sound but still did not allow for any variation in dynamics.

Known by the Spanish term &quot;chirimia&quot;, the shawm remains an important ritual instrument among Maya peoples of Highland Guatemala. Accompanied by a drum, the chirimia is frequently used in processions and in certain ritual dances, such as the Dance of the Conquest (Baile de la Conquista), and this is still played today.

==Progeny of the shawm==
A tenor shawm in C with a single key [without the customary lower extension to G], with a range of a perfect twelfth, was described as a &quot;nicolo&quot; according to Michael Praetorius in his &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot; II (1619), pages 23 and 36, but was not illustrated. Praetorius does, however, illustrate in Plate 13 in the supplementary volume of illustrations, the (1620), along with crumhorns, a &quot;bassett:nicolo&quot; which has the outward appearance of a capped shawm with four keys, but in fact conceals a mostly cylindrical bore. (The range of the bassett: nicolo descended to the A below great C and was just over four feet in length; a shawm of this range, i.e., with a conical bore, would require more than 9 feet of bore length.)

===Oboe===
The shawm inspired the later 17th-century &quot;hautbois&quot;, an invention of the French musician Martin Hotteterre (d. 1712). He is credited with devising essentially a brand-new instrument, one which borrowed several features from the shawm, chiefly its double reed and conical bore, but departed from it significantly in other respects, the most important departure being the fact the player places his lips directly on the reed with no intervening pirouette. Around 1670, the new French began replacing the shawm in military bands, concert music and opera; by 1700, the shawm had all but disappeared from concert life, although as late as 1830 shawms could still be heard in German town bands performing their municipal functions. Curiously, the Germans and Dutch continued to manufacture an ornate version of the shawm, called , well after the introduction of the French . Several examples of this instrument survive in European collections, although its exact musical use is unclear.

===Dulcian/bassoon===
The 16th-century proclivity for building instruments in a full range of sizes was naturally extended to the shawm, but the extreme length of pipe of the bass instruments meant that few were built and played, due to their cumbersome size. A solution was devised whereby the bore was in effect &quot;folded back&quot; upon itself, creating a much more manageable instrument. The new instrument is often referred to as the dulcian, and was called &quot;curtal&quot; in England, or in Germany and Italy, and in Spain. The dulcian, like the first oboes, employed direct lip-to-reed contact, which allowed for much greater control over the sound than was offered by shawms. This led to the dulcian becoming very popular, serving as a bass both to the other shawms and even to indoor ensembles that did not feature shawms, afforded by its ability to play quietly. The dulcian was the forerunner to the bassoon, which like the oboe was a Baroque invention.

===Charumera===
The , or , is a double-reed instrument in traditional Japanese music descended either from shawms brought to Japan by Portuguese Christian missionaries, or possibly Iberian traders in the 16th century. It is sometimes used in kabuki theatre performances. It is also strongly associated in popular culture with street vendors of ramen, who played a distinctive melody on it to attract customers.

<text>Amaranthaceae ( ) is a family of flowering plants commonly known as the amaranth family, in reference to its type genus &quot;Amaranthus&quot;. It includes the former goosefoot family Chenopodiaceae and contains about 165 genera and 2,040 species, making it the most species-rich lineage within its parent order, Caryophyllales.

==Description==

Most species in the Amaranthaceae are annual or perennial herbs or subshrubs; others are shrubs; very few species are vines or trees. Some species are succulent. Many species have stems with thickened nodes. The wood of the perennial stem has a typical &quot;anomalous&quot; secondary growth; only in subfamily Polycnemoideae is secondary growth normal.

The leaves are simple and mostly alternate, sometimes opposite. They never possess stipules. They are flat or terete, and their shape is extremely variable, with entire or toothed margins. In some species, the leaves are reduced to minute scales. In most cases, neither basal nor terminal aggregations of leaves occur. 

The flowers are solitary or aggregated in cymes, spikes, or panicles and typically perfect (bisexual) and actinomorphic. Some species have unisexual flowers. Bracts and bracteoles are either herbaceous or scarious. Flowers are regular with an herbaceous or scarious perianth of (one to) mostly five (rarely to eight) tepals, often joined. One to five stamens are opposite to tepals or alternating, inserting from a hypogynous disc, which may have appendages (pseudostaminodes) in some species. The anthers have two or four pollen sacs (locules). In tribe Caroxyloneae, anthers have vesicular appendages. The pollen grains are spherical with many pores (pantoporate), with pore numbers from a few to 250 (in &quot;Froelichia&quot;). One to three (rarely six) carpels are fused to a superior ovary with one (rarely two) basal ovule. Idioblasts are found in the tissues.

The diaspores are seeds or fruits (utricles), more often the perianth persists and is modified in fruit for means of dispersal. Sometimes even bracts and bracteoles may belong to the diaspore. More rarely the fruit is a circumscissile capsule or a berry. The horizontal or vertical seed often has a thickened or woody seed coat. The green or white embryo is either spirally (and without perisperm) or annular (rarely straight).


===Chromosome number===
The basic chromosome number is (rarely 6) mostly 8–9 (rarely 17).

===Phytochemistry===
Widespread in the Amaranthaceae is the occurrence of betalain pigments. The former Chenopodiaceae often contain isoflavonoids.

In phytochemical research, several methylenedioxyflavonols, saponins, triterpenoids, ecdysteroids, and specific root-located carbohydrates have been found in these plants.

===Photosynthesis pathway===
Although most of the family use the more common photosynthesis pathway, around 800 species are plants; this makes the Amaranthaceae the largest group with this photosynthesis pathway among the eudicots (which collectively includes about 1,600 species). Within the family, several types of photosynthesis occur, and about 17 different types of leaf anatomy are realized. Therefore, this photosynthesis pathway seems to have developed about 15 times independently during the evolution of the family. About two-thirds of the species belong to the former Chenopodiaceae. The first occurrence of photosynthesis dates from the early Miocene, about 24 million years ago, but in some groups, this pathway evolved much later, about 6 (or less) million years ago.

The multiple origin of photosynthesis in the Amaranthaceae is regarded as an evolutionary response to inexorably decreasing atmospheric levels, coupled with a more recent permanent shortage in water supply as well as high temperatures. Species that use water more efficiently had a selective advantage and were able to spread out into arid habitats.

==Taxonomy==
In the APG IV system of 2016, as in the previous Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classifications, the family is placed in the order Caryophyllales and includes the plants formerly treated as the family Chenopodiaceae. The monophyly of this broadly defined Amaranthaceae has been strongly supported by both morphological and phylogenetic analyses.

The family Amaranthaceae was first published in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, p. 87–88. The first publication of family Chenopodiaceae was in 1799 by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in &quot;Tableau du Regne Vegetal&quot;, 2, p. 253. The older name has priority and is now the valid scientific name of the extended Amaranthaceae (&quot;s.l.&quot; = &quot;sensu lato&quot;).

Some publications still continued to use the family name Chenopodiaceae. Phylogenetic research revealed the important impact of the subfamily Polycnemoideae on the classification (see cladogram): if Polycnemoideae are considered a part of Chenopodiaceae, then Amaranthaceae (&quot;s.str.&quot; = &quot;sensu stricto&quot;) have to be included, too, and the name of the extended family is Amaranthaceae. If Polycnemoideae would be separated as its own family, Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae (&quot;s.str.&quot;) would form two distinct monophyletic groups and could be treated as two separate families.

Amaranthaceae (&quot;s.l.&quot;) includes the former families Achyranthaceae , Atriplicaceae , Betaceae , Blitaceae , Celosiaceae , Chenopodiaceae &quot;nom. cons.&quot;, Corispermaceae , Deeringiaceae , Dysphaniaceae &quot;nom. cons.&quot;, Gomphrenaceae , Polycnemaceae , Salicorniaceae , Salsolaceae , and Spinaciaceae .

The systematics of Amaranthaceae are the subject of intensive recent research. Molecular genetic studies revealed the traditional classification, based on morphological and anatomical characters, often did not reflect the phylogenetic relationships.

The former Amaranthaceae (in their narrow circumscription) are classified into two subfamilies, Amaranthoideae and Gomphrenoideae, and contain about 65 genera and 900 species in tropical Africa and North America. The Amaranthoideae and some genera of Gomphrenoideae were found to be polyphyletic, so taxonomic changes are needed.

Current studies classified the species of former Chenopodiaceae to eight distinct subfamilies (the research is not yet completed): Polycnemoideae, which are regarded as a basal lineage, Betoideae, Camphorosmoideae, Chenopodioideae, Corispermoideae, Salicornioideae, Salsoloideae, and Suaedoideae. In this preliminary classification, the Amaranthaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; are divided into 10 subfamilies with approximately 180 genera and 2,500 species.

===Genera===
183 genera are accepted. A short synoptic list of genera is given here. For further and more detailed information, see the subfamily pages.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Amaranthaceae is a widespread and cosmopolitan family from the tropics to cool temperate regions. The Amaranthaceae (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) are predominantly tropical, whereas the former Chenopodiaceae have their centers of diversity in dry temperate and warm temperate areas. Many of the species are halophytes, tolerating salty soils, or grow in dry steppes or semi-deserts.

==Uses==
Some species, such as spinach (&quot;Spinacia oleracea&quot;) or forms of beet (&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;) (beetroot, chard), are used as vegetables. Forms of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; include fodder beet (&quot;Mangelwurzel&quot;) and sugar beet. The seeds of &quot;Amaranthus&quot;, lamb&#x27;s quarters (&quot;Chenopodium berlandieri&quot;), quinoa (&quot;Chenopodium quinoa&quot;) and kañiwa (&quot;Chenopodium pallidicaule&quot;) are edible and are used as pseudocereals.

&quot;Dysphania ambrosioides&quot; (epazote) and &quot;Dysphania anthelmintica&quot; are used as medicinal herbs. Several amaranth species are also used indirectly as a source of soda ash, such as members of the genus &quot;Salicornia&quot; (see glasswort).

A number of species are popular garden ornamental plants, especially species from the genera &quot;Alternanthera&quot;, &quot;Amaranthus&quot;, &quot;Celosia&quot;, and &quot;Iresine&quot;. Other species are considered weeds, e.g., redroot pigweed (&quot;Amaranthus retroflexus&quot;) and alligatorweed (&quot;Alternanthera philoxeroides&quot;), and several are problematic invasive species, particularly in North America, including &quot;Kali tragus&quot; and &quot;Bassia scoparia&quot;. Many species are known to cause pollen allergies.

<text>The scrub robins or bush chats are medium-sized insectivorous birds in the genus Cercotrichas. They were formerly considered to be in the thrush family, (Turdidae), but are more often now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher family, (Muscicapidae). They are not closely related to the Australian scrub-robins, genus &quot;Drymodes&quot; in the family Petroicidae.

The genus name &quot;Cercotrichas&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kerkos&quot;, &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;trikhas&quot;, &quot;thrush&quot;.

Scrub robins are mainly African species of open woodland or scrub, which nest in bushes or on the ground, but the rufous-tailed scrub robin also breeds in southern Europe and east to Pakistan.

The genus contains the following ten species:

<text>Droseraceae is a family of carnivorous flowering plants, also known as the sundew family. It consists of approximately 180 species in three extant genera, the vast majority being in the sundew genus &quot;Drosera&quot;. The family also contains the well-known Venus flytrap (&quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;) and the more obscure waterwheel plant (&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot;), both of which are the only living species of their respective genera. Representatives of the Droseraceae are found on all continents except Antarctica.

==Description==
Droseraceae are carnivorous herbaceous plants that may be annuals or perennials. Their leaves are alternate and adaxially circinate, with at least one leaf surface containing hairs with mucilage-producing glands at the tip. Their flowers are bisexual, usually with three carpels and five sepals, petals and stamens.  Their pollen grains are triporate or multiporate and released in tetrads. Despite being carnivorous, their flowers are insect-pollinated, typically with white to purple flowers that close at night. They produce small seeds that are dispersed by wind and water.

Most of the members of Droseraceae are contained in the genus &quot;Drosera&quot;, the sundews. Both &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; have only one extant species. &quot;Drosera&quot; species trap prey by secreting a sticky substance from hairs on their leaves. &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; both use snap-traps that close rapidly when the leaves are disturbed. &quot;Dionaea&quot; is terrestrial, while &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; is strictly aquatic. Like carnivorous plants of other families, the Droseraceae are able to supplement their nutrient intake, especially that of nitrogen, by capturing and digesting small animals such as insects. In this way, these plants are able to thrive in nutrient-deficient areas, such as sphagnum bogs.

===&quot;Drosera&quot;===
&quot;Drosera&quot; is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, and individual species vary extensively in their specific morphology. Common to all members of &quot;Drosera&quot; are highly modified leaves lined with tentacle-like glandular trichomes. At the end of each trichome, a bead of highly viscous mucilage is secreted, which resembles a drop of dew. The mucilage is a fairly pure aqueous solution of acidic polysaccharides with high molecular weights, which makes the mucilage not only highly viscous, but also very sticky, so much so, a single drop of mucilage may be stretched to lengths of up to a meter and cover one million times its original surface area. Insects and other prey animals are attracted by the smell of this mucilage and become stuck in it. Such snares are termed &quot;flypaper traps&quot;, but the trapping mechanism of sundews is often erroneously described as &quot;passive&quot;. In fact, sundew traps are quite active and sensitive, and the disturbance of one or a few trichomes quickly triggers an action potential that stimulates the rapid movement of other trichomes toward the prey. The leaf then curls in on itself, enveloping the prey for digestion.

Four &quot;Drosera&quot; subgenera are recognized today: subgenus &quot;Regiae&quot; and subgenus &quot;Arcturia&quot; are each monotypic (&quot;D. regia&quot; and &quot;D. arcturi,&quot; respectively), and the remaining &quot;Drosera&quot; are divided into two clades, subgenus &quot;Ergaleium&quot; and subgenus &quot;Drosera&quot;.

===&quot;Dionaea&quot;===
&quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;, better known as the Venus flytrap, is a globally famous carnivorous plant and according to Charles Darwin, &quot;one of the most wonderful in the world.&quot; The leaves of &quot;Dionaea&quot; are also highly modified and form a &quot;snap-trap&quot; that quickly shuts when a stimulus is detected. Three large trichomes extend outward on the inner surface of the trap. Two of these three hairs must be stimulated within a certain amount of time to trigger the trap. The trap closes as the result of a flipping of the trap lobes from a position where the exterior of the trap is concave to one where the exterior is convex. This movement can begin as soon as 0.4 seconds after stimulation and can be completed after one second.

===&quot;Aldrovanda&quot;===
&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot;, also called the waterwheel plant, is a free-floating, rootless, aquatic plant. It is less well-known than its relative &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;, but the two have similar trap structures. In 1875, Darwin described &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; as &quot;a miniature aquatic &quot;Dionaea&quot;&quot;. The trap of &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; is aquatic and is smaller and faster than that of &quot;Dionaea&quot;. In addition, while two stimuli are required to close a trap in &quot;Dionaea&quot;, only one is required in &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;. The trap of &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; closes about ten times faster than that of &quot;Dionaea&quot;.

==Etymology==
The type genus for the Droseraceae is &quot;Drosera&quot;, which was described and named by Linnaeus in 1753.  The name was derived from the Greek word &quot;droseros&quot;, meaning &quot;dewy&quot; or &quot;drops of water&quot;.  The &quot;Principia Botanica&quot;, published in 1787, states &quot;Sun-dew (&quot;Drosera&quot;) derives its name from small drops of a liquor-like dew, hanging on its fringed leaves, and continuing in the hottest part of the day, exposed to the sun.&quot;

==Phylogeny==
In 1867, Bentham and Hooker placed six genera in the Droseraceae: &quot;Dionaea, Aldrovanda, Drosera, Drosophyllum, Byblis,&quot; and &quot;Roridula&quot;.  Although these genera had significant differences in leaf and flower morphologies, they were grouped together on the basis of insect traps that appeared to be homologous. In 1922, &quot;Byblis&quot; and &quot;Roridula&quot; were moved into a new family, the Byblidaceae (and later further split out, forming the Roridulaceae). In the 1990s, both morphological and molecular evidence began to build that &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; differed from the other genera in the Droseraceae, &quot;Drosophyllum&quot;, another monotypic genus (&quot;Drosophyllum lusitanicum&quot; being the only species&quot;)&quot;, exhibits a flypaper-type trap similar to those of &quot;Drosera&quot;, but &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; does not actively curl its leaves to envelop captured prey animals. This important morphological distinction led researchers to question the validity of this taxon&#x27;s placement in Droseraceae. Other significant trait differences in &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; include pollen structure, trichome anatomy, and a woody stem with a deep taproot. Ultimately, &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; was shown to be more closely related to the carnivorous liana &quot;Triphyophyllum&quot; and the noncarnivorous liana &quot;Ancistrocladus&quot;, and is, thus, classified elsewhere (to be specific, its own monotypic family Drosophyllaceae). and APG III (2009) placed it into its own family, the Drosophyllaceae.  This left only the three genera (&quot;Dionaea, Aldrovanda, Drosera&quot;) that are classified as Droseraceae today.

Despite some debate, taxonomists have tended to include at least two of these three genera, and, in general, all three, in this family since at least 1906. Separate families for &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; have been proposed in the past. These were Dionaecae, proposed in 1933, and Aldrovandaceae, proposed in 1949. Ultimately, molecular and morphological evidence support the inclusion of all three, confirming that the Droseraceae are a monophyletic group. Molecular evidence also shows that the two genera with traps that snap shut (&quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;) are more closely related to each other than to &quot;Drosera&quot;, suggesting snap traps evolved only once.

The family Droseraceae is part of the order Caryophyllales in the Superasterid clade within the core eudicots. The family totals nearly 200 species. Caryophyllales are divided into two major suborders: Caryophyllineae, which contains the &quot;core&quot; Caryophyllales, such as Cactaceae and Amaranthaceae and is sister to the Polygonineae – the &quot;non-core&quot; Caryophyllales. This non-core clade is where Droseraceae is placed.

Recent molecular and biochemical evidence suggests the carnivorous taxa in the order Caryophyllales (the families Droseraceae, Drosophyllaceae, Nepenthaceae, and the species &quot;Triphyophyllum peltatum&quot;) all belong to the same clade, which does not consist only of carnivorous plants, but also of some noncarnivorous plants such as those in the family Ancistrocladaceae.

The fossil record of Droseraceae is the richest of any carnivorous plant family. Fossil pollen has been attributed to several extant, as well as extinct, genera, although some are of questionable validity.

==Evolution==
Darwin concluded that carnivory in plants was convergent, writing in 1875 that &quot;Utricularia&quot; and &quot;Nepenthes&quot; were not &quot;at all related to the Droseraceae&quot;. This remained a subject of debate for over a century. In 1960, Leon Croizat concluded that carnivory was monophyletic, and placed all the carnivorous plants together at the base of the angiosperms.  Molecular studies over the past 30 years have led to a wide consensus that Darwin was correct, with studies showing that carnivory evolved at least six times in the angiosperms, and that trap designs such as pitcher traps and flypaper traps are analogous rather than homologous.  

The origin of carnivory within the ancestors of the Droseraceae has been dated to 85.6 million years ago, with the evolution of snap-traps dated to 48 million years ago. Researchers have hypothesized that carnivory in the Droseraceae began with simple flypaper traps, followed by movement of tentacles in some &quot;Drosera&quot;-like species, followed by movement of leaves, leading eventually to the development of snap-traps in &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; by increasing the speed of the leaf movements and altering the morphology of the leaves.  Due to the sister relationship of &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda,&quot; it is likely that the snap-trap mechanism only evolved once, but it is unknown if the common ancestor was terrestrial or aquatic.

<text>Carlos Palomino (born August 10, 1949) is a Mexican former professional boxer. Palomino is a former World Welterweight Champion and member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Palomino is also an actor who has been featured in several television shows and films. He achieved a considerable amount of fame during the 1970s, especially among Mexican and Southern California fans.

==Early life==
He moved to Los Angeles, California from his native Mexico when he was ten years old.

==Amateur boxing career==
Palomino was an All-U.S. Army champion in 1971 and 1972. As an amateur, Palomino won the 1972 National AAU Light Welterweight Champion at 137 lb., defeating eventual Olympic gold medalist Ray Seales. He was discharged from the Army later that year and enrolled at Orange Coast College and later Long Beach State, where he obtained a degree.

==Professional boxing career==
In 1972, his name was becoming better known in California. This was likely caused by the number of his fights taking place there. He won five fights (one by knockout) in 1973.

In 1974, Palomino went through an increment in quality of opposition. He won six fights and lost one. He beat David Arellano twice, by a decision in ten and by knockout in nine, as well as Tommy Howard, by decision in ten, but he lost to Andy Price, who was a title contender at the time, by decision in ten in San Diego.

In 1975, he won four fights, and drew in two. He and Zovek Baraja had two bouts that year, the first one resulting in a ten-round draw and the second one being a nine-round knockout win for Palomino. He also drew with Hedgemon Lewis.

===WBC Welterweight Championship===
After winning two fights in 1976, Palomino found himself and his trainers travelling to London, where an internationally televised world championship bout awaited him against WBC world Welterweight champion John H. Stracey, a British boxing teacher who had dethroned José Nápoles as world champion. Palomino became a world champion on the night of June 22 of that year at Wembley Arena, after Stracey eventually succumbed to a blistering body attack and was put on the canvas twice from left hooks to the liver. Many Mexicans who viewed Nápoles, a Cuban born resident of Mexico, as another countryman, saw this as a revenge from Stracey.

He waited six months for his next fight, against another very popular boxer of Mexican background: cross-town rival Armando Muñíz. This was a fight that had many fans guessing who&#x27;d win it for months before it happened, but it also made history in the boxing books: When Palomino and Muñíz met, on January 21, 1977, it was the first time in boxing history two college graduates met for a world title. Palomino earned a degree in recreation administration from Long Beach State, while Muniz had graduated from Cal State Los Angeles, where he majored in Spanish and minored in math, and was working toward a graduate degree in administration. Palomino and Muniz (now a high school teacher in California) fought what the book &quot;The Ring: Boxing in the 20th. Century&quot; has described as one of the best fights of 1977. After 14 rounds, all three judges had the fight tied on their scorecards, but Palomino scored two knockdowns in the fifteenth and final round and he retained the world title by a knockout in that final round. A return to London resulted in an 11th-round knockout victory over &quot;Dave Boy Green&quot;, after which he defended against Everaldo Costa Azevedo and Jose Palacios, Azevedo being defeated by decision in fifteen and Palacios by knockout in thirteen. Azevedo was actually beating Palomino for the first 10 rounds of the fight.

In 1978, he defended his crown with a win over Ryu Sorimachi by a knockout in seven, a knockout in nine over Mimoun Mohatar, and a decision in fifteen in his long-awaited rematch with Muniz.

His championship run ended in 1979, when he traveled to Puerto Rico, where he was defeated on January 13 by hometown boxer Wilfred Benítez via a controversial fifteen-round split decision. Referee Zach Clayton scored the fight 145–142 in Palomino&#x27;s favor, but judges Jay Edson and Harry Gibbs disagreed. Edson scored the bout 146-142 for Benítez. Gibbs also scored for Benítez, 146–143.

===Palomino vs. Durán===
In his next fight, Palomino met legendary Roberto Durán on June 22 of that year at Madison Square Gardens, in another nationally televised bout, as part of the Larry Holmes–Mike Weaver world Heavyweight championship bout&#x27;s undercard. Palomino lost to Duran by decision in ten rounds, and he announced his retirement from boxing right away.

===Boxing comeback===
Palomino began his comeback on January 10, 1997, beating Ismaél Díaz by a knockout in round nine. He won four fights that year, including one over former world champion Rene Arredondo, but when he lost by decision in ten to former Oscar De La Hoya world title challenger Wilfredo Rivera on May 30, 1998, he decided to retire for good, and has stayed in retirement ever since.

==After boxing==

===Acting career===
In 1978 while still the WBC Welterweight Champion, Palomino appeared as &#x27;Carlos Navarone&#x27; in the ABC sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;. Appearing in the second episode of the opening season (&quot;One-Punch Banta&quot;), he spars with Tony Banta (Tony Danza – himself a former professional boxer with a 9–3 record) and takes a dive. Palomino accidentally hits Danza for real during one scene. Palomino appears as himself in an episode of &quot;The White Shadow&quot; in 1979.
In 1980, Miller Lite beer signed Palomino as a spokesman as part of a television commercial campaign that also included Walt Frazier and other noted athletes. As a consequence of the enjoyable experience and the media exposure that followed, he decided to launch a career as an actor. He participated in a number of movies, such as &quot;Fists of Steel&quot;, and television series, before deciding to launch a boxing comeback at the age of 48, in 1997.

Palomino appeared on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;The Fight&quot;. This episode was original aired on March 24, 1999.

Palomino was elected as chairman of the California State Athletic Commission, where he performed for a few years. He is now involved in charity work, most notably Tony Baltazar&#x27;s charity organization, and he travels around the United States to attend charity events and do autograph shows.

===IBHF===
Palomino was selected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame on January 8, 2004. He was inducted on June 13.

===Personal life===

On March 14, 1980, his younger brother, Paul Palomino – a member of the U.S. boxing team en route to Poland for a competition – was killed in the crash of LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007.

On December 19, 2008, Palomino&#x27;s girlfriend, Daliene Ingram, was featured in an episode of &quot;Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?&quot;. Her daughter Alexa, a fifth grader, was the extra classmate at the Mystery Desk for the occasion.

<text>The cochoas (from &quot;cocho&quot;, Nepali for &quot;Cochoa purpurea&quot;) are medium-sized frugivorous, insectivorous and molluscivorous birds in the genus Cochoa. Their bright contrasting plumage patterns, sexual dimorphism and feeding habits made their systematic position difficult to ascertain in early times, Richard Bowdler Sharpe placed them with the Prionopidae in 1879 while many considered them as some kind of aberrant thrush. The genus was previously included in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is more closely related to the thrush family Turdidae.

<text>The magpie-robins or shamas (from &quot;shama&quot;, Bengali and Hindi for &quot;C. malabaricus&quot;) are medium-sized insectivorous birds (some also eat berries and other fruit) in the genus Copsychus. They were formerly in the thrush family Turdidae, but are now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. They are garden- and forest-dwelling species found in Africa and Asia.

The genus &quot;Copsychus&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1827. The type species was subsequently designated as the oriental magpie-robin (&quot;Copsychus saularis&quot;) by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840. The name &quot;Copsychus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kopsukhos&quot; or &quot;kopsikhos&quot;, meaning &quot;blackbird&quot;.

The genus contains 17 species:
The Seychelles magpie-robin is one of the most endangered birds in the world, with a population of less than 250, although this is a notable increase from just 16 in 1970.

<doc id="247261" wikidata="Q379048" url="?curid=247261" title="Riemann–Roch theorem">
<text>The Riemann–Roch theorem is an important theorem in mathematics, specifically in complex analysis and algebraic geometry, for the computation of the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed zeros and allowed poles. It relates the complex analysis of a connected compact Riemann surface with the surface&#x27;s purely topological genus &quot;g&quot;, in a way that can be carried over into purely algebraic settings.

Initially proved as Riemann&#x27;s inequality by , the theorem reached its definitive form for Riemann surfaces after work of Riemann&#x27;s short-lived student . It was later generalized to algebraic curves, to higher-dimensional varieties and beyond.

== Preliminary notions==

A Riemann surface formula_1 is a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to an open subset of formula_2, the set of complex numbers. In addition, the transition maps between these open subsets are required to be holomorphic. The latter condition allows one to transfer the notions and methods of complex analysis dealing with holomorphic and meromorphic functions on formula_2 to the surface formula_1. For the purposes of the Riemann–Roch theorem, the surface formula_1 is always assumed to be compact. Colloquially speaking, the genus formula_6 of a Riemann surface is its number of handles; for example the genus of the Riemann surface shown at the right is three. More precisely, the genus is defined as half of the first Betti number, i.e., half of the formula_2-dimension of the first singular homology group formula_8 with complex coefficients. The genus classifies compact Riemann surfaces up to homeomorphism, i.e., two such surfaces are homeomorphic if and only if their genus is the same. Therefore, the genus is an important topological invariant of a Riemann surface. On the other hand, Hodge theory shows that the genus coincides with the formula_2-dimension of the space of holomorphic one-forms on formula_1, so the genus also encodes complex-analytic information about the Riemann surface.

A divisor formula_11 is an element of the free abelian group on the points of the surface. Equivalently, a divisor is a finite linear combination of points of the surface with integer coefficients.

Any meromorphic function formula_12 gives rise to a divisor denoted formula_13 defined as

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the set of all zeroes and poles of formula_12, and formula_17 is given by

:formula_18.

The set formula_15 is known to be finite; this is a consequence of formula_1 being compact and the fact that the zeros of a (non-zero) holomorphic function do not have an accumulation point. Therefore, formula_13 is well-defined. Any divisor of this form is called a principal divisor. Two divisors that differ by a principal divisor are called linearly equivalent. The divisor of a meromorphic 1-form is defined similarly. A divisor of a global meromorphic 1-form is called the canonical divisor (usually denoted formula_22). Any two meromorphic 1-forms will yield linearly equivalent divisors, so the canonical divisor is uniquely determined up to linear equivalence (hence &quot;the&quot; canonical divisor).

The symbol formula_23 denotes the &quot;degree&quot; (occasionally also called index) of the divisor formula_11, i.e. the sum of the coefficients occurring in formula_11. It can be shown that the divisor of a global meromorphic function always has degree 0, so the degree of a divisor depends only on its linear equivalence class.

The number formula_26 is the quantity that is of primary interest: the dimension (over formula_2) of the vector space of meromorphic functions formula_28 on the surface, such that all the coefficients of formula_29 are non-negative. Intuitively, we can think of this as being all meromorphic functions whose poles at every point are no worse than the corresponding coefficient in formula_11; if the coefficient in formula_11 at formula_32 is negative, then we require that formula_28 has a zero of at least that multiplicity at formula_32 – if the coefficient in formula_11 is positive, formula_28 can have a pole of at most that order. The vector spaces for linearly equivalent divisors are naturally isomorphic through multiplication with the global meromorphic function (which is well-defined up to a scalar).

== Statement of the theorem ==

The Riemann–Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface of genus formula_6 with canonical divisor formula_22 states

:formula_39.

Typically, the number formula_26 is the one of interest, while formula_41 is thought of as a correction term (also called index of speciality) so the theorem may be roughly paraphrased by saying

:&quot;dimension&quot; − &quot;correction&quot; = &quot;degree&quot; − &quot;genus&quot; + 1.

Because it is the dimension of a vector space, the correction term formula_41 is always non-negative, so that

:formula_43.

This is called &quot;Riemann&#x27;s inequality&quot;. &quot;Roch&#x27;s part&quot; of the statement is the description of the possible difference between the sides of the inequality. On a general Riemann surface of genus formula_6, formula_22 has degree formula_46, independently of the meromorphic form chosen to represent the divisor. This follows from putting formula_47 in the theorem. In particular, as long as formula_11 has degree at least formula_49, the correction term is 0, so that

:formula_50.

The theorem will now be illustrated for surfaces of low genus. There are also a number other closely related theorems: an equivalent formulation of this theorem using line bundles and a generalization of the theorem to algebraic curves.

===Examples===
The theorem will be illustrated by picking a point formula_51 on the surface in question and regarding the sequence of numbers

:formula_52

i.e., the dimension of the space of functions that are holomorphic everywhere except at formula_51 where the function is allowed to have a pole of order at most formula_54. For formula_55, the functions are thus required to be entire, i.e., holomorphic on the whole surface formula_1. By Liouville&#x27;s theorem, such a function is necessarily constant. Therefore, formula_57. In general, the sequence formula_58 is an increasing sequence.

====Genus zero====
The Riemann sphere (also called complex projective line) is simply connected and hence its first singular homology is zero. In particular its genus is zero. The sphere can be covered by two copies of formula_2, with transition map being given by

:formula_60.

Therefore, the form formula_61 on one copy of formula_62 extends to a meromorphic form on the Riemann sphere: it has a double pole at infinity, since

:formula_63

Thus, its canonical divisor is formula_64 (where formula_51 is the point at infinity).

Therefore, the theorem says that the sequence formula_58 reads

: 1, 2, 3, ... .

This sequence can also be read off from the theory of partial fractions. Conversely if this sequence starts this way, then formula_6 must be zero.

====Genus one====

The next case is a Riemann surface of genus formula_68, such as a torus formula_69, where formula_70 is a two-dimensional lattice (a group isomorphic to formula_71). Its genus is one: its first singular homology group is freely generated by two loops, as shown in the illustration at the right. The standard complex coordinate formula_32 on formula_73 yields a one-form formula_74 on formula_1 that is everywhere holomorphic, i.e., has no poles at all. Therefore, formula_22, the divisor of formula_77 is zero.

On this surface, this sequence is

:1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... ;

and this characterises the case formula_68. Indeed, for formula_79, formula_80, as was mentioned above. For formula_81 with formula_82, the degree of formula_83 is strictly negative, so that the correction term is 0. The sequence of dimensions can also be derived from the theory of elliptic functions.

====Genus two and beyond====
For formula_84, the sequence mentioned above is

:1, 1, ?, 2, 3, ... .

It is shown from this that the ? term of degree 2 is either 1 or 2, depending on the point. It can be proven that in any genus 2 curve there are exactly six points whose sequences are 1, 1, 2, 2, ... and the rest of the points have the generic sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, ... In particular, a genus 2 curve is a hyperelliptic curve. For formula_85 it is always true that at most points the sequence starts with formula_86 ones and there are finitely many points with other sequences (see Weierstrass points).

===Riemann–Roch for line bundles===
Using the close correspondence between divisors and holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface, the theorem can also be stated in a different, yet equivalent way: let &quot;L&quot; be a holomorphic line bundle on &quot;X&quot;. Let formula_87 denote the space of holomorphic sections of &quot;L&quot;. This space will be finite-dimensional; its dimension is denoted formula_88. Let &quot;K&quot; denote the canonical bundle on &quot;X&quot;. Then, the Riemann–Roch theorem states that

:formula_89.

The theorem of the previous section is the special case of when &quot;L&quot; is a point bundle.

The theorem can be applied to show that there are &quot;g&quot; linearly independent holomorphic sections of &quot;K&quot;, or one-forms on &quot;X&quot;, as follows. Taking &quot;L&quot; to be the trivial bundle, formula_90 since the only holomorphic functions on &quot;X&quot; are constants. The degree of &quot;L&quot; is zero, and formula_91 is the trivial bundle. Thus,

:formula_92.

Therefore, formula_93, proving that there are &quot;g&quot; holomorphic one-forms.

=== Degree of canonical bundle ===
Since the canonical bundle formula_22 has formula_93, applying Riemann–Roch to formula_96 gives

:formula_97

which can be rewritten as

:formula_98

hence the degree of the canonical bundle is formula_99.

===Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic curves===
Every item in the above formulation of the Riemann–Roch theorem for divisors on Riemann surfaces has an analogue in algebraic geometry. The analogue of a Riemann surface is a non-singular algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;. The difference in terminology (curve vs. surface) is because the dimension of a Riemann surface as a real manifold is two, but one as a complex manifold. The compactness of a Riemann surface is paralleled by the condition that the algebraic curve be complete, which is equivalent to being projective. Over a general field &quot;k&quot;, there is no good notion of singular (co)homology. The so-called geometric genus is defined as

:formula_100

i.e., as the dimension of the space of globally defined (algebraic) one-forms (see Kähler differential). Finally, meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface are locally represented as fractions of holomorphic functions. Hence they are replaced by rational functions which are locally fractions of regular functions. Thus, writing formula_26 for the dimension (over &quot;k&quot;) of the space of rational functions on the curve whose poles at every point are not worse than the corresponding coefficient in &quot;D&quot;, the very same formula as above holds:

:formula_39.

where &quot;C&quot; is a projective non-singular algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;. In fact, the same formula holds for projective curves over any field, except that the degree of a divisor needs to take into account multiplicities coming from the possible extensions of the base field and the residue fields of the points supporting the divisor. Finally, for a proper curve over an Artinian ring, the Euler characteristic of the line bundle associated to a divisor is given by the degree of the divisor (appropriately defined) plus the Euler characteristic of the structural sheaf formula_103.

The smoothness assumption in the theorem can be relaxed, as well: for a (projective) curve over an algebraically closed field, all of whose local rings are Gorenstein rings, the same statement as above holds, provided that the geometric genus as defined above is replaced by the arithmetic genus &quot;g&quot;&quot;a&quot;, defined as

:formula_104.

(For smooth curves, the geometric genus agrees with the arithmetic one.) The theorem has also been extended to general singular curves (and higher-dimensional varieties).

== Applications ==

=== Hilbert polynomial ===
One of the important consequences of Riemann–Roch is it gives a formula for computing the Hilbert polynomial of line bundles on a curve. If a line bundle formula_105 is ample, then the Hilbert polynomial will give the first degree formula_106 giving an embedding into projective space. For example, the canonical sheaf formula_107 has degree formula_46, which gives an ample line bundle for genus formula_109. If we set formula_110 then the Riemann–Roch formula reads

:formula_111

Giving the degree formula_112 Hilbert polynomial of formula_107

:formula_114.
Because the tri-canonical sheaf formula_115 is used to embed the curve, the Hilbert polynomial

formula_116

is generally considered while constructing the Hilbert scheme of curves (and the moduli space of algebraic curves). This polynomial is

formula_117

and is called the Hilbert polynomial of a genus g curve.

=== Pluricanonical embedding ===
Analyzing this equation further, the Euler characteristic reads as

:formula_118

Since formula_119

:formula_120.

for formula_121, since its degree is negative for all formula_109, implying it has no global sections, there is an embedding into some projective space from the global sections of formula_123. In particular, formula_115 gives an embedding into formula_125 where formula_126 since formula_127. This is useful in the construction of the moduli space of algebraic curves because it can be used as the projective space to construct the Hilbert scheme with Hilbert polynomial formula_128.

=== Genus of plane curves with singularities ===
An irreducible plane algebraic curve of degree &quot;d&quot; has (&quot;d&quot; − 1)(&quot;d&quot; − 2)/2 − &quot;g&quot; singularities, when properly counted. It follows that, if a curve has (&quot;d&quot; − 1)(&quot;d&quot; − 2)/2 different singularities, it is a rational curve and, thus, admits a rational parameterization.

=== Riemann–Hurwitz formula ===
The Riemann–Hurwitz formula concerning (ramified) maps between Riemann surfaces or algebraic curves is a consequence of the Riemann–Roch theorem.

=== Clifford&#x27;s theorem on special divisors ===
Clifford&#x27;s theorem on special divisors is also a consequence of the Riemann–Roch theorem. It states that for a special divisor (i.e., such that formula_129) satisfying formula_130, the following inequality holds:

:formula_131.

== Proof ==
=== Proof for algebraic curves ===
The statement for algebraic curves can be proved using Serre duality. The integer formula_26 is the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle formula_133 associated to &quot;D&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Cartier divisor). In terms of sheaf cohomology, we therefore have formula_134, and likewise formula_135. But Serre duality for non-singular projective varieties in the particular case of a curve states that formula_136 is isomorphic to the dual formula_137. The left hand side thus equals the Euler characteristic of the divisor &quot;D&quot;. When &quot;D&quot; = 0, we find the Euler characteristic for the structure sheaf is formula_138 by definition. To prove the theorem for general divisor, one can then proceed by adding points one by one to the divisor and ensure that the Euler characteristic transforms accordingly to the right hand side.

=== Proof for compact Riemann surfaces ===
The theorem for compact Riemann surfaces can be deduced from the algebraic version using Chow&#x27;s Theorem and the GAGA principle: in fact, every compact Riemann surface is defined by algebraic equations in some complex projective space. (Chow&#x27;s Theorem says that any closed analytic subvariety of projective space is defined by algebraic equations, and the GAGA principle says that sheaf cohomology of an algebraic variety is the same as the sheaf cohomology of the analytic variety defined by the same equations).

One may avoid the use of Chow&#x27;s theorem by arguing identically to the proof in the case of algebraic curves, but replacing formula_133 with the sheaf formula_140 of meromorphic functions &quot;h&quot; such that all coefficients of the divisor formula_29 are nonnegative. Here the fact that the Euler characteristic transforms as desired when one adds a point to the divisor can be read off from the long exact sequence induced by the short exact sequence

:formula_142

where formula_143 is the skyscraper sheaf at &quot;P&quot;, and the map formula_144 returns the formula_145th Laurent coefficient, where formula_146.

== Arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem ==
A version of the arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem states that if &quot;k&quot; is a global field, and &quot;f&quot; is a suitably admissible function of the adeles of &quot;k&quot;, then for every idele &quot;a&quot;, one has a Poisson summation formula:
:formula_147.
In the special case when &quot;k&quot; is the function field of an algebraic curve over a finite field and &quot;f&quot; is any character that is trivial on &quot;k&quot;, this recovers the geometric Riemann–Roch theorem.

Other versions of the arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem make use of Arakelov theory to resemble the traditional Riemann–Roch theorem more exactly.

== Generalizations of the Riemann–Roch theorem ==

The Riemann–Roch theorem for curves was proved for Riemann surfaces by Riemann and Roch in the 1850s and for algebraic curves by Friedrich Karl Schmidt in 1931 as he was working on perfect fields of finite characteristic. As stated by Peter Roquette,
The first main achievement of F. K. Schmidt is the discovery that the classical theorem of Riemann–Roch on compact Riemann surfaces can be transferred to function fields with finite base field. Actually, his proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem works for arbitrary perfect base fields, not necessarily finite.
It is foundational in the sense that the subsequent theory for curves tries to refine the information it yields (for example in the Brill–Noether theory).

There are versions in higher dimensions (for the appropriate notion of divisor, or line bundle). Their general formulation depends on splitting the theorem into two parts. One, which would now be called Serre duality, interprets the formula_41 term as a dimension of a first sheaf cohomology group; with formula_26 the dimension of a zeroth cohomology group, or space of sections, the left-hand side of the theorem becomes an Euler characteristic, and the right-hand side a computation of it as a &quot;degree&quot; corrected according to the topology of the Riemann surface.

In algebraic geometry of dimension two such a formula was found by the geometers of the Italian school; a Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces was proved (there are several versions, with the first possibly being due to Max Noether).

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional generalisation, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, was found and proved by Friedrich Hirzebruch, as an application of characteristic classes in algebraic topology; he was much influenced by the work of Kunihiko Kodaira. At about the same time Jean-Pierre Serre was giving the general form of Serre duality, as we now know it.

Alexander Grothendieck proved a far-reaching generalization in 1957, now known as the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem. His work reinterprets Riemann–Roch not as a theorem about a variety, but about a morphism between two varieties. The details of the proofs were published by Armand Borel and Jean-Pierre Serre in 1958. Later, Grothendieck and his collaborators simplified and generalized the proof.

Finally a general version was found in algebraic topology, too. These developments were essentially all carried out between 1950 and 1960. After that the Atiyah–Singer index theorem opened another route to generalization. Consequently, the Euler characteristic of a coherent sheaf is reasonably computable. For just one summand within the alternating sum, further arguments such as vanishing theorems must be used.

<doc id="247274" wikidata="Q721790" url="?curid=247274" title="Extended family">
<text>An extended family is a family that extends beyond the nuclear family of parents and their children to include aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins or other relatives, all living nearby or in the same household. Particular forms include the stem and joint families.

==Description==
In some circumstances, the extended family comes to live either with or in place of a member of the immediate family. These families include, in one household or close proximity, relatives in addition to an immediate family. An example would be an elderly parent who moves in with his or her children due to old age. In modern Western cultures dominated by immediate family constructs, the term has come to be used generically to refer to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, whether they live together within the same household or not. However, it may also refer to a family unit in which several generations live together within a single household. In some cultures, the term is used synonymously with consanguineous family.

A stem family is a kind of extended family, first discussed by Frédéric Le Play. Parents will live with one child and his/her spouse, as well as the children of both, while other children will leave the house or remain in it, unmarried. The stem family is sometimes associated with inegalitarian inheritance practices, as in Japan and Korea, but the term has also been used in some contexts to describe a family type where parents live with a married child and his or her spouse and children, but the transfer of land and moveable property is more or less egalitarian, as in the case of traditional Romania, northeastern Thailand or Mesoamerican indigenous peoples. In these cases, the child who cares for the parents usually receives the house in addition to his or her own share of land and moveable property.

==Sociology==
Often, it has been presumed that extended family groups sharing a single household enjoy specific advantages, such as a greater sense of security and belonging due to sharing a wider pool of members to serve as resources during a crisis, and more role models to help perpetuate desired behavior and cultural values. However, even in cultures in which adults are expected to leave home after marriage to begin their own nuclear-based households, the extended family often forms an important support network offering similar advantages. Particularly in working-class communities, grown children tend to establish their own households within the same general area as their parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. These extended family members tend to gather often for family events and to feel responsible for helping and supporting one another, both emotionally and financially.

While contemporary families may be considered more mobile in general than in the past, sociologists find that this has not necessarily resulted in the disintegration of extended family networks. Rather, technological aids such as the Internet and social networking sites such as Facebook are now commonly used to retain contact and maintain these family ties.

Particularly in the case of single-parent households, it can be helpful for extended family members to share a single household in order to share the burden of meeting expenses. On the other hand, sharing a household can present a disadvantage depending on the sizes and number of families involved, particularly when only a few members shoulder most of the responsibility to meet expenses for the family&#x27;s basic needs.

An estimated 49 million Americans (16.1% of the total population) live in homes comprising three or more generations, up from 42 million in 2000. This situation is similar in Western Europe. Another 34 percent live within a kilometer of their children.

==Around the world==
In many cultures, such as in those of Asians,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchard 2006 https://archive.org/details/practisingmental00prit/page/n125 111&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Middle Easterners, Africans, Indigenous peoples like Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, and Latin Americans and Caribbeans, even for Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans (Orthodox/Catholic countries), extended families are the basic family unit. That is to say the modern western nuclear family is not the norm. Even in Western Europe, extended families (mostly of the stem type) were also clearly prevalent, England being a rare exception. In Britain and the United States, during the Industrial Revolution (approximately 1750 to 1900), more people lived in extended families than at any time before or since.

It is common for today&#x27;s world to have older children in nuclear families to reach walking up to driving age ranges before meeting extended family members. Geographical isolation is common for middle-class families who move based on occupational opportunities while family branches &quot;retain [their] basic independence&quot;. Some extended families hold family reunions or opportunities for gathering regularly, normally around holiday time frames, to reestablish and integrate a stronger family connection. This allows individual nuclear families to connect with extended family members.

Where families consist of multiple generations living together, the family is usually headed by the elders. More often than not, it consists of grandparents, their sons, and their sons&#x27; families in patriarchal and especially patrilineal societies. Extended families make discussions together and solve the problem. 

===Indian subcontinent===

Historically, for generations South Asia had a prevailing tradition of the &quot;joint family system&quot; or &quot;undivided family&quot;. The joint family system is an extended family arrangement prevalent throughout the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India, consisting of many generations living in the same home, all bound by the common relationship. A patrilineal joint family consists of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons&#x27; wives and children. The family is headed by a patriarch, usually the oldest male, who makes decisions on economic and social matters on behalf of the entire family. The patriarch&#x27;s wife generally exerts control over the household, minor religious practices and often wields considerable influence in domestic matters. Family income flows into a common pool, from which resources are drawn to meet the needs of all members, which are regulated by the heads of the family.

===Recent trend in the United States===

In the early stages of the twentieth century, it was not very common to find many families with extended kin in their household, which may have been due to the idea that the young people in these times typically waited to establish themselves and start a household before they married and filled a home. As life expectancy becomes older and programs such as Social Security benefit the elderly, the old are now beginning to live longer than prior generations, which then may lead to generations mixing together. According to results of a study by Pew Research Center in 2010, approximately 50 million (nearly one in six) Americans, including rising numbers of seniors, live in households with at least two adult generations, and often three. It has become an ongoing trend for elderly generations to move in and live with their children, as they can give them support and help with everyday living. The main reasons cited for this shift are an increase in unemployment and slumped housing prices and arrival of new immigrants from Asian and South American countries. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 2.7 million grandparents raising their grandchildren in 2009. The dramatic increase in grandparent-headed households has been attributed to many factors including parental substance abuse. In 2003, the number of U.S. &quot;family groups&quot; where one or more subfamilies live in a household (e.g. a householder&#x27;s daughter has a child. The mother-child is a subfamily) was 79 million. Two-point-six million of U.S. multigenerational family households in 2000 had a householder, the householder&#x27;s children, and the householder&#x27;s grandchildren. That is 65 percent of multigenerational family households in the U.S. So it is twice as common for a grandparent to be the householder than for adult children to bring parents into their home. The increase in the number of multigenerational households has created complex legal issues, such as who in the household has authority to consent to police searches of the family home or private bedrooms.

Besides the legal issues that multigenerational households could create, there are issues that may arise from households where the grandparents are the sole guardians. The Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act was signed into law on July 7, 2018 after unanimously passing the U.S. House and Senate. It was first introduced in the Senate on May 10, 2017 by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey Jr. (D-PA). Out of this came The Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Advisory Council which will identify, promote, coordinate, and disseminate to the public information, resources, and the best practices available to help grandparents and other older relatives both meet the needs of the children in their care and maintain their own physical and mental health and emotional well-being.

===Mexico===
Mexican society is composed of three-generational units consisting of grandparents, children, and grandchildren. Further close relationships are maintained with the progenitors of these families and are known as kin or &quot;cousins&quot;. When one is born, they are born into two extended families, a kinship group of sometimes 70 people. The group traditionally acts as a cohesive unit, pooling resources and influence. The extended family also consists of spouses and siblings. This is in contrast to the two generational American nuclear family.

Some scholars have used the term &quot;grand-family&quot; to describe the close relationship between grandparents, children, and grandchildren in Mexican society. Larissa A. Lomnitz and Marisol Perez-Lizaur, for example, describe the grand-family as &quot;the basic unit of family solidarity in Mexico&quot;, where basic family obligations between grandparents, children, and grandchildren include &quot;economic support, participation in family rituals, and social recognition&quot;.

===Economic background===

The relative economic deprivation of racial and ethnic minorities leads to higher levels of extended family involvement; primarily because blacks and Latinos have less money and education than whites, they are more likely to give and receive help from kin. Having family on which one can rely is very important in times of economic hardship especially if there are children involved. Living in an extended family provides constant care for children and support for other members of the family as well. Analysis of the National Survey of Families and Households suggests there are differences between whites and other ethnic groups because of economic differences among racial groups: blacks and Latinos less often have the economic resources that allow the kind of privatization that the nuclear family entails. Extended kinship, then, is a survival strategy in the face of economic difficulties. Being able to rely on not only two parents but grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters helps to create a support system which in turn brings families closer together. Living in an extended family provides many things that a nuclear family does not.

The number of multigenerational households has been steadily rising because of the economic hardships people are experiencing today. According to the AARP, multigenerational households have increased from 5 million in 2000 to 6.2 million in 2008. &quot;There&#x27;s no question that with some ethnicities that are growing in America, it is more mainstream and traditional to have multigenerational households. We&#x27;re going to see that increasing in the general population as well,&quot; says AARP&#x27;s Ginzler. While high unemployment and housing foreclosures of the recession have played a key role in the trend, Pew Research Center exec VP and co-author of its multigenerational household study Paul Taylor said it has been growing over several decades, fueled by demographic and cultural shifts such as the rising number of immigrants and the rising average age of young-adult marriages. The importance of an extended family is one that many people may not realize, but having a support system and many forms of income may help people today because of the difficulties in finding a job and bringing in enough money.

<text>Autobianchi () was an Italian automobile manufacturer, created jointly by Bianchi, Pirelli and Fiat in 1955. Autobianchi produced only a handful of models during its lifetime, which were almost exclusively small cars, with the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111, a small family car. Autobianchis were priced higher than Fiat models of similar size and the brand was used by Fiat to test innovative concepts which later found their way into mainstream Fiat vehicles; these concepts included fibreglass bodies and front-wheel drive.

The most famous Autobianchi models include the A112 released in 1969, a small hatchback very popular in Italy for racing, and which ceased production in 1986; as well as the Y10, which was the first car to use Fiat&#x27;s new FIRE (Fully Integrated Robotised Engine). With the Primula model, Fiat was able to introduce and prove an innovative front-engine, front-drive layout, which enabled an especially large interior volume and ultimately became the predominant front engine/drive layout, worldwide.

Autobianchi was subsequently purchased by the Fiat group and integrated into the operations of Lancia. The Autobianchi marque survived in Italy until 1995, when Y10 production ended.

==History==
===Origins===
Bianchi, founded in 1885 by Edoardo Bianchi and now remembered primarily as a bicycle manufacturer, was also active in passenger car manufacturing from 1899. Bianchis were in general high-end luxury cars, made with high attention to detail. The company&#x27;s factory in Abruzzi was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Edoardo Bianchi himself died in 1946 in a car accident, and the ownership of the firm passed to his son, Giuseppe. Even though a new, modern facility was constructed in Desio after the war, economic conditions forced Giuseppe not to resume passenger car production, but rather to focus on bicycles, motorcycles and commercial vehicles. Bianchi bicycles are still manufactured.

Bianchi&#x27;s general manager, Ferruccio Quintavalle, wanted to take advantage of the company&#x27;s extensive experience in manufacturing cars and ordered the preparation of studies and prototypes of possible new models. Soon it became apparent that resuming passenger car production would not be feasible without a help of stronger partner. Therefore, Bianchi turned to large industrial groups Fiat and Pirelli with a proposal to form a new company to produce automobiles. Thus, the Autobianchi company was born, with the agreement signed by the three parties on 11 January 1955, and share capital of 3 million lira, 33% of which belonged to the Bianchi family. A new, modern, purpose-built plant for the production of Autobianchi cars was erected on an area of 140,000 square metres in Desio.

Each of the partners had a clearly defined role and interest in the venture. Fiat was to provide the technical base and components for the assembly of the cars. It was seeking to capture the premium niche of the small car market, at that time occupied by coachbuilders such as Moretti and Vignale, who were building their models on Fiat chassis. Pirelli, which was to supply tires for the cars, sought to expand their OEM market share. Bianchi, was assigned the duties of preparing the bodies and assembling complete vehicles; a step towards their desired return to full passenger car production.

===The Bianchina===

The first car to be produced by the new company was the Bianchina, whose name was a tribute to Edoardo Bianchi&#x27;s first 1899 car. The Bianchina was based on Fiat 500 mechanicals – with its two-cylinder, air-cooled engine mounted in the rear – but featured a completely new stylish body designed by Luigi Rapi, who was in charge of Fiat&#x27;s special body unit and helped to set up production in Desio. With many premium design and equipment features, the Bianchina was an upscale city car, positioned above the Fiat 500 in the market. Marketed as a &quot;second vehicle in the household&quot;, and a luxurious &quot;recreational vehicle&quot;, also being targeted at affluent middle-class women, it mirrored the increasing affluence in Italian society.

The first Bianchina rolled from the production lines in Desio on September 11, 1957, and had the unusual body style of a two-door landaulet, called &quot;Trasformabile&quot;. It remained the sole body style until 1960, when a two-door &quot;Cabriolet&quot; full convertible was introduced, followed by a three-door estate version, the &quot;Panoramica&quot; and a two-door saloon, the &quot;Berlina&quot;. Finally, two van versions were launched: one resembling a two-seater version of the &quot;Panoramica&quot;, and another, with a raised and expanded cargo section.

===Stellina and Primula – Autobianchi pioneers new concepts===

Five years after the debut of the Bianchina, at the 1963 Turin Motor Show, a completely new Autobianchi model debuted: the Autobianchi Stellina. A two-door spider based on the Fiat 600D&#x27;s chassis was distinguished by its fibreglass body, designed by Tom Tjaarda. It was Italy&#x27;s first car with such a body. The vehicle was only produced for two years (1964 and 1965) and only 502 Stellinas were made. Nevertheless, the model was an important step in the development of new technology for Fiat and the rest of the automotive industry. Its lofty price-tag of almost a million lira further emphasized the elevated status of the Autobianchi brand within the Fiat empire.

Even more important was the following year&#x27;s presentation, the Autobianchi Primula. It was Fiat&#x27;s first attempt at a front-wheel drive car with a transverse engine, a configuration popularized by the British Mini and allowing for very compact and efficient utilization of the body space. Designed by Fiat&#x27;s technical director, Dante Giacosa, it was launched under the Autobianchi brand to test market reaction to the new concept. The Primula&#x27;s particular configuration of front wheel drive with a transverse engine, but with a gearbox on the end of the engine and unequal length drive shafts, rather than a gearbox in the sump like the Mini, became universal; as did its use of conventional steel suspension in almost all other cars with the exception of Citroen – usually MacPherson struts at the front and a &quot;dead&quot; rear axle. Indeed, Peugeot in facelifting their 305 range on the early 1980s switched from their former adherence to the Mini in-sump gearbox to the Primula&#x27;s end-on gearbox configuration. The Primula is thus a car design of far greater significance than is often realised, as its design influence spread far beyond even the mainstream high volume Fiats such as the 127 and the 128 of the late 1960s. Even though the new Autobianchi was priced higher than Fiat models of similar size, the car met with a favorable reception. Fiat would gradually move all of its models to front-wheel drive.

Throughout its production run the Primula was available as a two-door or five-door saloon, three-door of five-door hatchback, and two-door coupé, with either a 1,221 cc or a 1,197 cc four-cylinder engine. The top-of-the-line Primula Coupé S used a 75 PS (SAE) 1,438 cc four-cylinder from the Fiat 124 Special. The lack of a fifth gear limited the high-end capacity of all Primula models.

===Into the 1970s===
Facing a crisis in the motorcycle market, Bianchi was forced to sell its share in Autobianchi and the company was finally fully integrated into Fiat S.p.A. in 1968. 1969 marked many important developments for the marque. First of all, Bianchina production was finally stopped. Moreover, Autobianchi was positioned within the Fiat Group under the control of the newly acquired luxury marque Lancia. And significantly, two new Autobianchi models were launched this year: the Autobianchi A111 and Autobianchi A112, both named after their internal Fiat development codes, in a similar fashion to coeval Fiat-branded vehicles.

The A111 was derived from Primula mechanicals, but much bigger and more spacious, marking the first (and only) entry of the brand into the small family car class. As usual, it was priced higher than similar Fiat models, notably the first front-wheel drive Fiat &quot;per se&quot;, the Fiat 128, and did not find much favour with customers. After little more than 50,000 A111s were made, production ended in 1972.
The A112 was much more successful. A modern, front-wheel drive supermini it was in many ways similar to the Innocenti Mini, which gained substantial popularity in Italy, following on from the popularity of the original Mini throughout Europe. Similarly, the A112 saw strong demand and built a loyal following, reinforced by the introduction of Abarth sporting versions and Autobianchi&#x27;s engagement in racing with modified versions of the model.

With Primula production ceasing in 1970 and the quick demise of the A111, Autobianchi became effectively a one-model brand. Consequently, the A112 was marketed as a Lancia from the mid-1970s in most markets, except for Italy, France and Israel, where it retained the Autobianchi branding until the end of production.

===Discontinuation===
The A112 continued in production for 17 years, with frequent, often substantial, changes. After production over 1,250,000, the last A112 was built in May 1986 and was replaced by the Autobianchi Y10, based mechanically on the Fiat Panda. Branded as a Lancia for most export markets (except for France and Israel, until 1989), it retained Autobianchi badging and branding in Italy. The Desio plant closed in 1992 and the Y10 replaced by the Lancia Y (branded as Lancia in all markets including Italy), the Autobianchi brand ended in 1996.

The rights to the brand are now held by the &quot;Registro Autobianchi&quot;, the official club of the marque in Italy.

<doc id="247287" wikidata="Q583259" url="?curid=247287" title="Las Vegas Aviators">
<text>The Las Vegas Aviators, formerly known as the Las Vegas 51s and Las Vegas Stars, are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Athletics. They are located in Summerlin South, Nevada, a community in Las Vegas. The Aviators play their home games at Las Vegas Ballpark, a 10,000-seat facility which opened in 2019. The team previously played at Cashman Field from 1983 to 2018.

The team has been members of the Pacific Coast League since 1983, including the 2021 season when it was known as the Triple-A West, and won the PCL championship as the Stars in 1986 and 1988.

== History ==
=== Las Vegas Stars (1983–2000) ===
The Las Vegas Pacific Coast League franchise traces its roots to the Portland Beavers who entered the PCL in 1919 after a two-year hiatus. The team relocated to Spokane, Washington, in 1973, becoming the Spokane Indians. The franchise moved once again in 1983, becoming the Las Vegas Stars.

The Stars, who were the Triple-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres, became the first professional sports team to play in Las Vegas since the Las Vegas Quicksilvers soccer club who played a single season in 1977. The Stars&#x27; inaugural season was quite successful, posting an 83–60 record and winning the first-half championship for the Southern Division leading to a playoff berth, but eventually losing to the Albuquerque Dukes. The following season, the Stars posted another successful campaign, going 71–65 and winning their second division championship (first half), but ultimately losing in the league semifinals to the Hawaii Islanders. After a dismal 1985 campaign, the Stars finished the 1986 season with an 80–62 record and won the second half of the Southern Division. In the league semifinals, the Stars defeated the Phoenix Firebirds, 3–2, and went on to win their first PCL championship, defeating the Vancouver Canadians in five games. The Stars won their second PCL championship in 1988, once again defeating Vancouver, this time in four games.

After winning five division titles and two league championships in their first six years, the Stars hit a skid, posting a .500 or better record only four times and winning shares of only two division championships in the following 12 years. The Stars were unable to advance past the first round of the playoffs in both seasons that they qualified. The team&#x27;s affiliation with the Padres ended after the 2000 season.

=== Las Vegas 51s (2001–2018) ===
In 2001, Las Vegas became the top farm club of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The new affiliation was accompanied by rebranding to the Las Vegas 51s in reference to Area 51, a military base located north-northwest of Las Vegas legendary for rumors of its housing UFOs and other extraterrestrial technology. The team adopted a logo featuring a grey alien head and introduced an extraterrestrial mascot named Cosmo.

A new affiliate, moniker, and appearance did not translate into improved performance on the field. The 51s experienced only two winning seasons during their eight years as the Triple-A Dodgers. Their only division title came under manager Brad Mills in 2002 as the team posted the best record in the league at 85–59, but lost three games to one to the eventual PCL champion Edmonton Trappers.

On March 24, 2008, Mandalay Baseball Properties sold the 51s franchise to Stevens Baseball Group. There were no plans to move the team, and talks of building a new stadium to replace the ageing Cashman Field became stagnant. The Dodgers and the 51s had a rocky relationship during their eight-year affiliation. The Dodgers were not pleased with Cashman Field, which barely met the standards for Triple-A baseball. It had no weight room or indoor batting cages, and it was decrepit compared to other stadiums in the league. Citing the inadequacies of Cashman and lack of planning for a replacement, Los Angeles decided not to renew their player development contract (PDC) with Las Vegas after the 2008 season.

Following the departure of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 51s signed a PDC with the Toronto Blue Jays, marking the first time that the 51s were affiliated with an American League club. The only time the team finished over .500 with the Blue Jays was in 2012 when Marty Brown led the team to a 79–64 second-place finish. The Blue Jays ended their affiliation with the 51s after the season.

In April 2013, the team was purchased for $20 million by Summerlin Las Vegas Baseball Club, a 50/50 joint venture of The Howard Hughes Corporation and Play Ball Owners Group, including investors Steve Mack, Bart Wear, and Chris Kaempfer, with intentions of moving it to a proposed stadium in Summerlin near the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino. Howard Hughes later bought out the Play Ball group in 2017, becoming the sole owner of the team.

The 51s became affiliated with the New York Mets in 2013 when they were the only Triple-A team left without an MLB parent. They won back-to-back division titles in 2013 and 2014 under manager Wally Backman, but were eliminated in the Pacific Conference championship series on both occasions.

In 2017 the 51s became one of the first teams to participate in the Copa de la Diversión initiative and for selected games played as the Reyes de Plata (&quot;Silver Kings&quot;). The name was a nod to Nevada being the &quot;Silver State&quot; and a homage to the contribution migrant workers made to the mining industry of Nevada.

In October 2017, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority approved a 20-year, $80 million naming rights agreement to help pay for the new $150 million 10,000-seat ballpark which opened in 2019. Las Vegas Ballpark, located in Summerlin, includes 22 suites, a center field pool, kids&#x27; zone, and several bars. Construction began in 2018 and was completed for the 2019 season.

In late 2017, the Mets announced plans to move its Triple-A affiliation to the Syracuse Mets beginning in 2019, meaning the 51s would be in need of a new major league affiliate.

=== Las Vegas Aviators (2019–present) ===

Following the conclusion of the 2018 season, Las Vegas signed a two-year PDC with the then Oakland Athletics that ran through 2020. In addition to having a new major league affiliate in 2019 and playing in a new ballpark, the team also changed its name to the Las Vegas Aviators. The name is in reference to aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. The team&#x27;s new logo depicts a pilot wearing a flight helmet and utilizes their new color scheme of navy blue, orange, tangerine, gold, yellow, and gray. Their first home game at Las Vegas Ballpark was a 10–2 win against the Sacramento River Cats on April 9 before a sellout crowd of 11,036. Las Vegas secured the win with a five-run second inning in which Skye Bolt scored the winning run when he came home on a fielding error. Aviators pitchers Chris Bassitt and Daniel Mengden combined to strikeout 14 Sacramento batters.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. 

With the 2021 Major League Baseball restructuring of Minor League Baseball, the Aviators were organized into the Triple-A West. Las Vegas ended the season in third place in the Western Division with a 62–58 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Las Vegas finished the tournament tied for 13th place with a 3–3 record. 

In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In 2024, ownership of the team and stadium transferred to Seaport Entertainment Group, a spin-off from Howard Hughes Holdings.

==Season-by-season records==


== Media ==
The Las Vegas Aviators are covered by Las Vegas&#x27; two daily newspapers, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; and &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;. Every Aviators game is broadcast by KRLV 920-AM, with Russ Langer and Matt Neverett as the broadcast&#x27;s play-by-play men. Several prominent sports radio and television personalities made their start as broadcaster for the Stars and 51s, most notably Fox Sports&#x27; Colin Cowherd.

<doc id="247288" wikidata="Q431617" url="?curid=247288" title="Partial fraction decomposition">
<text>In algebra, the partial fraction decomposition or partial fraction expansion of a rational fraction (that is, a fraction such that the numerator and the denominator are both polynomials) is an operation that consists of expressing the fraction as a sum of a polynomial (possibly zero) and one or several fractions with a simpler denominator.

The importance of the partial fraction decomposition lies in the fact that it provides algorithms for various computations with rational functions, including the explicit computation of antiderivatives, Taylor series expansions, inverse Z-transforms, and inverse Laplace transforms. The concept was discovered independently in 1702 by both Johann Bernoulli and Gottfried Leibniz.

In symbols, the &quot;partial fraction decomposition&quot; of a rational fraction of the form formula_1 where and are polynomials, is the expression of the rational fraction as

formula_2

where
 is a polynomial, and, for each ,
the denominator is a power of an irreducible polynomial (i.e. not factorizable into polynomials of positive degrees), and
the numerator is a polynomial of a smaller degree than the degree of this irreducible polynomial.

When explicit computation is involved, a coarser decomposition is often preferred, which consists of replacing &quot;irreducible polynomial&quot; by &quot;square-free polynomial&quot; in the description of the outcome. This allows replacing polynomial factorization by the much easier-to-compute square-free factorization. This is sufficient for most applications, and avoids introducing irrational coefficients when the coefficients of the input polynomials are integers or rational numbers.

== Basic principles ==

Let 
formula_3 
be a rational fraction, where and are univariate polynomials in the indeterminate over a field. The existence of the partial fraction can be proved by applying inductively the following reduction steps.

===Polynomial part===
There exist two polynomials and such that 
formula_4
and
formula_5
where formula_6 denotes the degree of the polynomial .

This results immediately from the Euclidean division of by , which asserts the existence of and such that formula_7 and formula_8

This allows supposing in the next steps that formula_9

===Factors of the denominator===
If formula_10 and 
formula_11
where and are coprime polynomials, then there exist polynomials formula_12 and formula_13 such that
formula_14
and
formula_15

This can be proved as follows. Bézout&#x27;s identity asserts the existence of polynomials and such that 
formula_16
(by hypothesis, is a greatest common divisor of and ).

Let formula_17 with formula_18 be the Euclidean division of by formula_19 Setting formula_20 one gets
formula_21
It remains to show that formula_22 By reducing the last sum of fractions to a common denominator, one gets
formula_23
and thus
formula_24

===Powers in the denominator===
Using the preceding decomposition inductively one gets fractions of the form formula_25 with formula_26 where is an irreducible polynomial. If , one can decompose further, by using that an irreducible polynomial is a square-free polynomial, that is, formula_27 is a greatest common divisor of the polynomial and its derivative. If formula_28 is the derivative of , Bézout&#x27;s identity provides polynomials and such that formula_29 and thus formula_30 Euclidean division of formula_31 by formula_32 gives polynomials formula_33 and formula_34 such that formula_35 and formula_36 Setting formula_37 one gets
formula_38
with formula_39

Iterating this process with formula_40 in place of formula_41 leads eventually to the following theorem.

===Statement===
{p_i^j}.&lt;/math&gt;

If , then .}}

The uniqueness can be proved as follows. Let . All together, and the have coefficients. The shape of the decomposition defines a linear map from coefficient vectors to polynomials of degree less than . The existence proof means that this map is surjective. As the two vector spaces have the same dimension, the map is also injective, which means uniqueness of the decomposition. By the way, this proof induces an algorithm for computing the decomposition through linear algebra.

If is the field of complex numbers, the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that all have degree one, and all numerators formula_42 are constants. When is the field of real numbers, some of the may be quadratic, so, in the partial fraction decomposition, quotients of linear polynomials by powers of quadratic polynomials may also occur.

In the preceding theorem, one may replace &quot;distinct irreducible polynomials&quot; by &quot;pairwise coprime polynomials that are coprime with their derivative&quot;. For example, the may be the factors of the square-free factorization of . When is the field of rational numbers, as it is typically the case in computer algebra, this allows to replace factorization by greatest common divisor computation for computing a partial fraction decomposition.

==Application to symbolic integration==

For the purpose of symbolic integration, the preceding result may be refined into

{p_i^{j-1}}\right)&#x27; + \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{c_{i1}}{p_i}.&lt;/math&gt;
where formula_43 denotes the derivative of formula_44}}

This reduces the computation of the antiderivative of a rational function to the integration of the last sum, which is called the &quot;logarithmic part&quot;, because its antiderivative is a linear combination of logarithms. 

There are various methods to compute decomposition in the Theorem. One simple way is called Hermite&#x27;s method. First, &quot;b&quot; is immediately computed by Euclidean division of &quot;f&quot; by &quot;g&quot;, reducing to the case where deg(&quot;f&quot;) &lt; deg(&quot;g&quot;). Next, one knows deg(&quot;c&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) &lt; deg(&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;), so one may write each &quot;cij&quot; as a polynomial with unknown coefficients. Reducing the sum of fractions in the Theorem to a common denominator, and equating the coefficients of each power of &quot;x&quot; in the two numerators, one gets a system of linear equations which can be solved to obtain the desired (unique) values for the unknown coefficients.

== Procedure ==

Given two polynomials formula_45 and formula_46, where the &quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot; are distinct constants and , explicit expressions for partial fractions can be obtained by supposing that
formula_47
and solving for the &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; constants, by substitution, by equating the coefficients of terms involving the powers of &quot;x&quot;, or otherwise. (This is a variant of the method of undetermined coefficients. After both sides of the equation are multiplied by Q(x), one side of the equation is a specific polynomial, and the other side is a polynomial with undetermined coefficients. The equality is possible only when the coefficients of like powers of &quot;x&quot; are equal. This yields n equations in n unknowns, the ck.)

A more direct computation, which is strongly related to Lagrange interpolation, consists of writing
formula_48
where formula_49 is the derivative of the polynomial formula_34. The coefficients of formula_51 are called the residues of &quot;f/g&quot;.

This approach does not account for several other cases, but can be modified accordingly:

* If formula_52 then it is necessary to perform the Euclidean division of &quot;P&quot; by &quot;Q&quot;, using polynomial long division, giving with . Dividing by &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) this gives formula_53 and then seek partial fractions for the remainder fraction (which by definition satisfies ).
* If &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) contains factors which are irreducible over the given field, then the numerator &quot;N&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of each partial fraction with such a factor &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in the denominator must be sought as a polynomial with , rather than as a constant. For example, take the following decomposition over R: formula_54
* Suppose and , that is is a root of of multiplicity . In the partial fraction decomposition, the first powers of will occur as denominators of the partial fractions (possibly with a zero numerator). For example, if the partial fraction decomposition has the form formula_55

=== Illustration ===

In an example application of this procedure, can be decomposed in the form

formula_56

Clearing denominators shows that . Expanding and equating the coefficients of powers of gives
Solving this system of linear equations for and yields . Hence,

formula_57

=== Residue method ===

Over the complex numbers, suppose &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a rational proper fraction, and can be decomposed into

formula_58

Let
formula_59
then according to the uniqueness of Laurent series, &quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the coefficient of the term in the Laurent expansion of &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) about the point &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, i.e., its residue
formula_60

This is given directly by the formula
formula_61
or in the special case when &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a simple root,
formula_62
when
formula_63

== Over the reals ==

Partial fractions are used in real-variable integral calculus to find real-valued antiderivatives of rational functions. Partial fraction decomposition of real rational functions is also used to find their Inverse Laplace transforms. For applications of partial fraction decomposition over the reals, see

* Application to symbolic integration, above
* Partial fractions in Laplace transforms

=== General result ===

Let formula_64 be any rational function over the real numbers. In other words, suppose there exist real polynomials functions formula_65 and formula_66, such that
formula_67

By dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the leading coefficient of formula_68, we may assume without loss of generality that formula_68 is monic. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write

formula_70

where formula_71, formula_72, formula_73 are real numbers with formula_74, and formula_75, formula_76 are positive integers. The terms formula_77 are the &quot;linear factors&quot; of formula_68 which correspond to real roots of formula_68, and the terms formula_80 are the &quot;irreducible quadratic factors&quot; of formula_68 which correspond to pairs of complex conjugate roots of formula_68.

Then the partial fraction decomposition of formula_64 is the following:

formula_84

Here, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a (possibly zero) polynomial, and the &quot;A&quot;&quot;ir&quot;, &quot;B&quot;&quot;ir&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;&quot;ir&quot; are real constants. There are a number of ways the constants can be found.

The most straightforward method is to multiply through by the common denominator &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). We then obtain an equation of polynomials whose left-hand side is simply &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and whose right-hand side has coefficients which are linear expressions of the constants &quot;A&quot;&quot;ir&quot;, &quot;B&quot;&quot;ir&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;&quot;ir&quot;. Since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal, we can equate the coefficients of like terms. In this way, a system of linear equations is obtained which &quot;always&quot; has a unique solution. This solution can be found using any of the standard methods of linear algebra. It can also be found with limits (see Example 5).
== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===

formula_85

Here, the denominator splits into two distinct linear factors:

formula_86

so we have the partial fraction decomposition

formula_87

Multiplying through by the denominator on the left-hand side gives us the polynomial identity

formula_88

Substituting &quot;x&quot; = −3 into this equation gives &quot;A&quot; = −1/4, and substituting &quot;x&quot; = 1 gives &quot;B&quot; = 1/4, so that

formula_89

=== Example 2 ===

formula_90

After long division, we have

formula_91

The factor &quot;x&quot;2 − 4&quot;x&quot; + 8 is irreducible over the reals, as its discriminant is negative. Thus the partial fraction decomposition over the reals has the shape

formula_92

Multiplying through by &quot;x&quot;3 − 4&quot;x&quot;2 + 8&quot;x&quot;, we have the polynomial identity

formula_93

Taking &quot;x&quot; = 0, we see that 16 = 8&quot;A&quot;, so &quot;A&quot; = 2. Comparing the &quot;x&quot;2 coefficients, we see that 4 = &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; = 2 + &quot;B&quot;, so &quot;B&quot; = 2. Comparing linear coefficients, we see that −8 = −4&quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot; = −8 + &quot;C&quot;, so &quot;C&quot; = 0. Altogether,

formula_94

The fraction can be completely decomposed using complex numbers. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra every complex polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; has &quot;n&quot; (complex) roots (some of which can be repeated). The second fraction can be decomposed to:

formula_95

Multiplying through by the denominator gives:

formula_96

Equating the coefficients of and the constant (with respect to ) coefficients of both sides of this equation, one gets a system of two linear equations in and , whose solution is

formula_97

Thus we have a complete decomposition:

formula_98

One may also compute directly and with the residue method (see also example 4 below).

=== Example 3 ===

This example illustrates almost all the &quot;tricks&quot; we might need to use, short of consulting a computer algebra system.

formula_99

After long division and factoring the denominator, we have

formula_100

The partial fraction decomposition takes the form

formula_101

Multiplying through by the denominator on the left-hand side we have the polynomial identity

formula_102

Now we use different values of &quot;x&quot; to compute the coefficients:

formula_103

Solving this we have:

formula_104

Using these values we can write:

formula_105

We compare the coefficients of &quot;x&quot;6 and &quot;x&quot;5 on both side and we have:

formula_106

Therefore:

formula_107

which gives us &quot;B&quot; = 0. Thus the partial fraction decomposition is given by:

formula_108

Alternatively, instead of expanding, one can obtain other linear dependences on the coefficients computing some derivatives at formula_109 in the above polynomial identity. (To this end, recall that the derivative at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot; of (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) vanishes if &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 and is just &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) for &quot;m&quot; = 1.) For instance the first derivative at &quot;x&quot; = 1 gives

formula_110

that is 8 = 4&quot;B&quot; + 8 so &quot;B&quot; = 0.

===Example 4 (residue method)===

formula_111

Thus, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) can be decomposed into rational functions whose denominators are &quot;z&quot;+1, &quot;z&quot;−1, &quot;z&quot;+i, &quot;z&quot;−i. Since each term is of power one, −1, 1, −&quot;i&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are simple poles.

Hence, the residues associated with each pole, given by
formula_112
are 
formula_113
respectively, and

formula_114

===Example 5 (limit method)===

Limits can be used to find a partial fraction decomposition. Consider the following example:

formula_115

First, factor the denominator which determines the decomposition:

formula_116

Multiplying everything by formula_117, and taking the limit when formula_118, we get

formula_119

On the other hand,

formula_120

and thus:

formula_121

Multiplying by and taking the limit when formula_122, we have

formula_123

and

formula_124

This implies and so formula_125.

For , we get formula_126 and thus formula_127.

Putting everything together, we get the decomposition

formula_128

===Example 6 (integral)===
Suppose we have the indefinite integral:

formula_129

Before performing decomposition, it is obvious we must perform polynomial long division and factor the denominator. Doing this would result in:

formula_130

Upon this, we may now perform partial fraction decomposition.

formula_131
so:
formula_132.
Upon substituting our values, in this case, where x=1 to solve for B and x=-2 to solve for A, we will result in:

formula_133

Plugging all of this back into our integral allows us to find the answer:

formula_134

== The role of the Taylor polynomial ==

The partial fraction decomposition of a rational function can be related to Taylor&#x27;s theorem as follows. Let

formula_135

be real or complex polynomials 
assume that

formula_136

satisfies
formula_137

Also define

formula_138

Then we have

formula_139

if, and only if, each polynomial formula_140 is the Taylor polynomial of formula_141 of order formula_142 at the point formula_143:

formula_144

Taylor&#x27;s theorem (in the real or complex case) then provides a proof of the existence and uniqueness of the partial fraction decomposition, and a characterization of the coefficients.

===Sketch of the proof===

The above partial fraction decomposition implies, for each 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;, a polynomial expansion

formula_145

so formula_146 is the Taylor polynomial of formula_141, because of the unicity of the polynomial expansion of order formula_142, and by assumption formula_149.

Conversely, if the formula_146 are the Taylor polynomials, the above expansions at each formula_143 hold, therefore we also have

formula_152

which implies that the polynomial formula_153 is divisible by formula_154

For formula_155 is also divisible by formula_156, so

formula_157

is divisible by formula_34. Since

formula_159

we then have

formula_160

and we find the partial fraction decomposition dividing by formula_161.

== Fractions of integers ==

The idea of partial fractions can be generalized to other integral domains, say the ring of integers where prime numbers take the role of irreducible denominators. For example:

formula_162

<text>Marcel André Henri Félix Petiot (17 January 1897 – 25 May 1946) was a French medical doctor and serial killer. He was convicted of multiple murders after the discovery of the remains of 23 people in the basement of his home in Paris during World War II. He is suspected of the murder of about 60 to 200 victims during his lifetime, although the true number remains unknown.

Despite showing early signs of mental illness and criminal behaviour, Petiot served in the First World War, graduated from an accelerated medical program, and began a dubious medical career that included performing abortions and supplying narcotics. His political career was marked by scandal, theft, and corruption. During the Second World War, Petiot operated a fraudulent escape network, offering safe passage to those wanted by the Nazis for a fee, only to murder them, steal their valuables, and dispose of their bodies. In total, he was suspected of around 60 murders, but the remains of only 23 victims were found in the basement of his Paris home. Captured in 1944, Petiot claimed to be a Resistance hero who killed only the enemies of France. He was convicted of 26 counts of murder and was executed by guillotine in 1946. His life and heinous crimes have been depicted in film and comic books.

Marcel Petiot was born on 17 January 1897 in Auxerre, Yonne, in north central France. During his teenage years, he robbed a postbox and was charged with damage to public property and theft. Petiot was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, resulting in charges being dismissed when it was judged that he had a mental illness.

Later accounts make various claims of Petiot&#x27;s delinquency and criminal acts during his youth, but it is unknown whether they were invented afterwards for public consumption. A psychiatrist reaffirmed Petiot&#x27;s mental illness on 26 March 1914. After being expelled from school many times, he finished his education in a special academy in Paris in July 1915.

Petiot volunteered for the French Army in World War I, entering service in January 1916. He was wounded and gassed in the Second Battle of the Aisne, and exhibited more symptoms of a mental breakdown. Petiot was sent to various rest homes, where he was arrested for stealing army blankets, morphine, and other army supplies, as well as wallets, photographs, and letters; he was jailed in Orléans. In a psychiatric hospital in Fleury-les-Aubrais, Petiot was again diagnosed with various mental illnesses but was returned to the front in June 1918. He was transferred three weeks later after he allegedly injured his foot with a grenade, but was attached to a new regiment in September. A new diagnosis was enough to get him discharged with a disability pension.

==Medical and political career==
After the war, Petiot entered the accelerated education program intended for war veterans, completed medical school in eight months, and became an intern at the mental hospital in Évreux. He received his medical degree in December 1921 and relocated to Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, where he received payment for his services both from the patients and from government medical assistance funds. At this time Petiot was already using addictive narcotics. While working at Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, he gained a reputation for dubious medical practices, such as supplying narcotics and performing illegal abortions, as well as for petty theft.

Petiot&#x27;s first murder victim might have been Louise Delaveau, an elderly patient&#x27;s daughter with whom Petiot had an affair in 1926. Delaveau disappeared during May of that year, and neighbours later said they had seen Petiot load a trunk into his car. Police investigated but eventually dismissed her case as a runaway. That same year, Petiot campaigned for mayor of Villeneuve-sur-Yonne and hired somebody to disrupt a political debate with his opponent. He won, and while in office embezzled town funds. The next year, Petiot married Georgette Lablais, the 23-year-old daughter of a wealthy landowner and butcher in Seignelay. Their son Gerhardt was born in April 1928.

The prefect of Yonne received many complaints about Petiot&#x27;s thefts and dubious financial dealings. He was eventually suspended as mayor in August 1931 and resigned. However, Petiot still had many supporters, and the village council also resigned in sympathy with him. Five weeks later, on 18 October, he was elected as a councillor of Yonne Département. In 1932, he was accused of stealing electricity from the village and lost his council seat. By this time he had already relocated to Paris.

In Paris, Petiot attracted patients by using fake credentials, and built an impressive reputation for his practice at 66 Rue de Caumartin. However, there were rumours of illegal abortions and excessive prescriptions of addictive remedies. In 1936, Petiot was appointed &quot;médecin d&#x27;état-civil&quot;, with authority to write death certificates. The same year, he was institutionalized briefly for kleptomania, but was released the next year. He persisted in tax evasion.

==World War II activities==
After the 1940 German defeat of France, French citizens were drafted for forced labour in Germany. Petiot provided false medical disability certificates to people who were drafted. He also treated the illnesses of workers who had returned. In July 1942, he was convicted of overprescribing narcotics, even though two addicts who would have testified against him had disappeared. He was fined 2,400 francs.

Petiot later claimed that during the period of German occupation, he was engaged in Resistance activities. He supposedly developed secret weapons that killed Germans without leaving forensic evidence, planted booby traps all over Paris, had high-level meetings with Allied commanders, and worked with a (nonexistent) group of Spanish anti-fascists.

There is no evidence for any of these statements. However, in 1980, he was cited by former U.S. spymaster Col. John F. Grombach as a World War II source. Grombach had been founder and commander of a small independent espionage agency, known later as &quot;The Pond&quot;, which operated from 1942 to 1955. Grombach asserted that Petiot had reported the Katyn Forest massacre, German missile development at Peenemünde, and the names of Abwehr agents sent to the U.S. While these claims were not corroborated by any records of other intelligence services, in 2001, some &quot;Pond&quot; records were discovered, including a cable that mentioned Petiot.

==Fraudulent escape network==
Petiot&#x27;s most lucrative activity during the Occupation was his false escape route. Using the codename &quot;Dr. Eugène&quot;, Petiot pretended to have a means of getting people wanted by the Germans or the Vichy government to safety outside France. Petiot claimed that he could arrange a passage to Argentina or elsewhere in South America through Portugal, for a price of 25,000 francs per person. Three accomplices, Raoul Fourrier, Edmond Pintard, and René-Gustave Nézondet, directed victims to &quot;Dr. Eugène&quot;, including Jews, Resistance fighters, and ordinary criminals. Once victims were in his control, Petiot told them that Argentine officials required all entrants to the country to be inoculated against disease, and with this excuse injected them with cyanide. He then took all their valuables and disposed of the bodies.

At first, Petiot dumped the bodies in the Seine, but he later destroyed the bodies by submerging them in quicklime or incinerating them. In 1941, Petiot bought a house at 21 Rue le Sueur, near the Arc de Triomphe. He purchased the house the same week that Henri Lafont returned to Paris with money and permission from the Abwehr to recruit new members for the French Gestapo.

The Gestapo eventually learned about this &quot;route&quot; for the escape of wanted persons, which they assumed was part of the Resistance. Gestapo agent Robert Jodkum forced prisoner Yvan Dreyfus to approach the supposed network, but Dreyfus simply vanished. A later informer successfully infiltrated the operation, and the Gestapo arrested Fourrier, Pintard and Nézondet. During the torture, they confessed that &quot;Dr. Eugène&quot; was Marcel Petiot.

Nézondet was later released, but three others spent eight months in prison, suspected of helping Jews to escape. Even during torture, they did not identify any other members of the Resistance because they knew of none. The Gestapo released the three men in January 1944.

==Discovery of murders==
On 11 March 1944, Petiot&#x27;s neighbours in Rue Le Sueur complained to police about a foul stench in the area and large volumes of smoke billowing from a chimney of the house. Fearing a chimney fire, the police summoned firemen, who entered the house and found a great fire in a coal stove in the basement. In the fire, and scattered in the basement, were human remains.

In addition to those found in his basement, human remains were also found in a pit filled partly with quicklime in the backyard and in a canvas bag. In his home, enough body parts were found to account for at least ten victims. Also scattered throughout his property were suitcases, clothing, and assorted property of his victims.

The media reaction was an intense media circus, with news reaching Switzerland, Belgium, and Scandinavia.

==Evasion and capture==
During the intervening seven months, Petiot hid with friends, claiming that the Gestapo wanted him because he had killed Germans and informers. He eventually began living with a patient, Georges Redouté, let his beard grow, and adopted various aliases.

During the liberation of Paris in 1944, Petiot adopted the name &quot;Henri Valeri&quot; and joined the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) in the uprising. He became a captain in charge of counter-espionage and prisoner interrogations.

When the newspaper &quot;Résistance&quot; published an article about Petiot, his defence attorney from the 1942 narcotics case received a letter in which his fugitive client claimed that the published allegations were mere lies. This gave the police a hint that Petiot was still in Paris. The search began anew – with &quot;Henri Valeri&quot; among those who were drafted to find him. Finally, on 31 October, Petiot was recognized at a Paris Métro station, and arrested. Among his possessions were a pistol, 31,700 francs, and 50 sets of identity documents.

==Trial and sentence==
Petiot was imprisoned in La Santé Prison. He claimed that he was innocent and that he had killed only enemies of France. He said that he had discovered the pile of bodies in 21 Rue le Sueur in February 1944, but had assumed that they were collaborators killed by members of his Resistance &quot;network&quot;.

However, the police found that Petiot had no friends in any of the major Resistance groups. Some of the Resistance groups he spoke of had never existed, and there was no proof of any of his claimed exploits. Prosecutors eventually charged him with at least 27 murders for profit. Their estimate of his gains was as much as 200 million francs.

Petiot was tried on 19 March 1946, accused of 135 criminal charges. Celebrity attorney René Floriot acted for the defence, against a team comprising state prosecutors and twelve civil lawyers hired by relatives of Petiot&#x27;s victims. Petiot taunted the prosecuting lawyers and claimed that various victims had been collaborators or double agents, or that vanished people were alive and well in South America using new names. He admitted to killing 19 of the 27 victims found in his house, and claimed that they were Germans and collaborators – part of a total of 63 &quot;enemies&quot; killed. Floriot attempted to portray Petiot as a Resistance hero, but the judges and jurors were unimpressed. Petiot was convicted of 26 counts of murder, and sentenced to death.

On 25 May 1946, Petiot was beheaded, after a stay of a few days due to a problem with the release mechanism of the guillotine, and buried at Ivry Cemetery.

==In popular culture==

Petiot&#x27;s murder of Jews and his fraudulent escape network were depicted by the 1990 French movie &quot;Docteur Petiot&quot; that chronicles his life between 1941 and 1944. Petiot was portrayed by actor Michel Serrault.

&quot;The Butcher of Paris&quot;, written by Stephanie Phillips with art by Dean Kotz, is a 2019 five-issue comic book mini-series that dramatized the investigation, arrest, and eventual conviction of Petiot.

Petiot is also an important character in Roberta Kagan&#x27;s book series &quot;The Auschwitz Twins&quot;.

<doc id="247296" wikidata="Q1454111" url="?curid=247296" title="Free abelian group">
<text>In mathematics, a free abelian group is an abelian group with a basis. Being an abelian group means that it is a set with an addition operation that is associative, commutative, and invertible. A basis, also called an integral basis, is a subset such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as an integer combination of finitely many basis elements. For instance the two-dimensional integer lattice forms a free abelian group, with coordinatewise addition as its operation, and with the two points (1,0) and (0,1) as its basis. Free abelian groups have properties which make them similar to vector spaces, and may equivalently be called free the free modules over the integers. Lattice theory studies free abelian subgroups of real vector spaces. In algebraic topology, free abelian groups are used to define chain groups, and in algebraic geometry they are used to define divisors. 

The elements of a free abelian group with basis formula_1 may be described in several equivalent ways. These include formal sums which are expressions of the form formula_2 where each formula_3 is a nonzero integer, each formula_4 is a distinct basis element, and the sum has finitely many terms. Alternatively, the elements of a free abelian group may be thought of as signed multisets containing finitely many elements with the multiplicity of an element in the multiset equal to its coefficient in the formal sum. 
Another way to represent an element of a free abelian group is as a function from formula_1 to the integers with finitely many nonzero values; for this functional representation, the group operation is the pointwise addition of functions.

Every set formula_1 has a free abelian group with formula_1 as its basis. This group is unique in the sense that every two free abelian groups with the same basis are isomorphic. Instead of constructing it by describing its individual elements, a free abelian group with basis formula_1 may be constructed as a direct sum of copies of the additive group of the integers, with one copy per member Alternatively, the free abelian group with basis formula_1 may be described by a presentation with the elements of formula_1 as its generators and with the commutators of pairs of members as its relators. The rank of a free abelian group is the cardinality of a basis; every two bases for the same group give the same rank, and every two free abelian groups with the same rank are isomorphic. Every subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian; this fact allows a general abelian group to be understood as a quotient of a free abelian group by &quot;relations&quot;, or as a cokernel of an injective homomorphism between free abelian groups. The only free abelian groups that are free groups are the trivial group and the infinite cyclic group.

==Definition and examples==

A free abelian group is an abelian group that has a basis. Here, being an abelian group means that it is described by a set formula_11 of its elements and a binary operation conventionally denoted as an additive group by the formula_12 symbol (although it need not be the usual addition of numbers) that obey the following properties:
*The operation formula_12 is commutative and associative, meaning for all elements formula_14 and Therefore, when combining two or more elements of formula_11 using this operation, the ordering and grouping of the elements does not affect the result.
*formula_11 contains an identity element (conventionally denoted with the property that, for every 
*Every element formula_17 in formula_11 has an inverse element such that 
A basis is a subset formula_1 of the elements of formula_11 with the property that every element of formula_11 may be formed in a unique way by choosing finitely many basis elements formula_4 choosing a nonzero integer formula_23 for each of the chosen basis elements, and adding together formula_23 copies of the basis elements formula_4 for which formula_23 is positive, and formula_27 copies of formula_28 for each basis element for which formula_23 is negative. As a special case, the identity element can always be formed in this way as the combination of zero basis elements, according to the usual convention for an empty sum, and it must not be possible to find any other combination that represents the identity.

The under the usual addition operation, form a free abelian group with the The integers are commutative and associative, with 0 as the additive identity and with each integer having an additive inverse, its negation. Each non-negative formula_17 is the sum of formula_17 copies and each negative integer formula_17 is the sum of formula_33 copies so the basis property is also satisfied.

An example where the group operation is different from the usual addition of numbers is given by the positive rational numbers which form a free abelian group with the usual multiplication operation on numbers and with the prime numbers as their basis. Multiplication is commutative and associative, with the number formula_34 as its identity and with formula_35 as the inverse element for each positive rational The fact that the prime numbers forms a basis for multiplication of these numbers follows from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, according to which every positive integer can be factorized uniquely into the product of finitely many primes or their inverses. If formula_36 is a positive rational number expressed in simplest terms, then formula_37 can be expressed as a finite combination of the primes appearing in the factorizations of formula_38 The number of copies of each prime to use in this combination is its exponent in the factorization of formula_38, or the negation of its exponent in the factorization 

The polynomials of a single with integer coefficients, form a free abelian group under polynomial addition, with the powers of formula_17 as a basis. As an abstract group, this is the same as (an isomorphic group to) the multiplicative group of positive rational numbers. One way to map these two groups to each other, showing that they are isomorphic, is to reinterpret the exponent of the prime number in the multiplicative group of the rationals as instead giving the coefficient of formula_41 in the corresponding polynomial, or vice versa. For instance the rational number formula_42 has exponents of formula_43 for the first three prime numbers formula_44 and would correspond in this way to the polynomial formula_45 having the same coefficients formula_43 for its constant, linear, and quadratic terms. Because these mappings merely reinterpret the same numbers, they define a bijection between the elements of the two groups. And because the group operation of multiplying positive rationals acts additively on the exponents of the prime numbers, in the same way that the group operation of adding polynomials acts on the coefficients of the polynomials, these maps preserve the group structure; they are homomorphisms. A bijective homomorphism is called an isomorphism, and its existence demonstrates that these two groups have the same properties.

Although the representation of each group element in terms of a given basis is unique, a free abelian group has generally more than one basis, and different bases will generally result in different representations of its elements. For example, if one replaces any element of a basis by its inverse, one gets another basis. As a more elaborated example, the two-dimensional integer lattice consisting of the points in the plane with integer Cartesian coordinates, forms a free abelian group under vector addition with the basis For this basis, the element formula_47 can be written where &#x27;multiplication&#x27; is defined so that, for instance, There is no other way to write formula_47 in the same basis. However, with a different basis such as it can be written as Generalizing this example, every lattice forms a finitely-generated free abelian group. The integer lattice formula_49 has a natural basis consisting of the positive integer unit vectors, but it has many other bases as well: if formula_50 is a formula_51 integer matrix with then the rows of formula_50 form a basis, and conversely every basis of the integer lattice has this form. For more on the two-dimensional case, see fundamental pair of periods.

==Constructions==
Every set can be the basis of a free abelian group, which is unique up to group isomorphisms. The free abelian group for a given basis set can be constructed in several different but equivalent ways: as a direct sum of copies of the integers, as a family of integer-valued functions, as a signed multiset, or by a presentation of a group.

===Products and sums===
The direct product of groups consists of tuples of an element from each group in the product, with componentwise addition. The direct product of two free abelian groups is itself free abelian, with basis the disjoint union of the bases of the two groups. More generally the direct product of any finite number of free abelian groups is free abelian. The integer lattice, for instance, is isomorphic to the direct product of formula_53 copies of the integer The trivial group formula_54 is also considered to be free abelian, with basis the empty set. It may be interpreted as an empty product, the direct product of zero copies 

For infinite families of free abelian groups, the direct product is not necessarily free abelian. For instance the Baer–Specker group an uncountable group formed as the direct product of countably many copies was shown in 1937 by Reinhold Baer to not be free abelian, although Ernst Specker proved in 1950 that all of its countable subgroups are free abelian. Instead, to obtain a free abelian group from an infinite family of groups, the direct sum rather than the direct product should be used. The direct sum and direct product are the same when they are applied to finitely many groups, but differ on infinite families of groups. In the direct sum, the elements are again tuples of elements from each group, but with the restriction that all but finitely many of these elements are the identity for their group. The direct sum of infinitely many free abelian groups remains free abelian. It has a basis consisting of tuples in which all but one element is the identity, with the remaining element part of a basis for its group.

Every free abelian group may be described as a direct sum of copies with one copy for each member of its basis. This construction allows any set formula_1 to become the basis of a free abelian group.

===Integer functions and formal sums===
Given a one can define a group formula_56 whose elements are functions from formula_1 to the integers, where the parenthesis in the superscript indicates that only the functions with finitely many nonzero values are included.
If formula_58 and formula_59 are two such functions, then formula_60 is the function whose values are sums of the values in formula_61 that is, This pointwise addition operation gives formula_56 the structure of an abelian group.

Each element formula_17 from the given set formula_1 corresponds to a member the function formula_65 for which formula_66 and for which formula_67 for 
Every function formula_61 in formula_56 is uniquely a linear combination of a finite number of basis elements:
formula_70
Thus, these elements formula_65 form a basis and formula_56 is a free abelian group.
In this way, every set formula_1 can be made into the basis of a free abelian group.

The elements of formula_56 may also be written as formal sums, expressions in the form of a sum of finitely many terms, where each term is written as the product of a nonzero integer with a distinct member These expressions are considered equivalent when they have the same terms, regardless of the ordering of terms, and they may be added by forming the union of the terms, adding the integer coefficients to combine terms with the same basis element, and removing terms for which this combination produces a zero coefficient. They may also be interpreted as the signed multisets of finitely many elements 

===Presentation===
A presentation of a group is a set of elements that generate the group (meaning that all group elements can be expressed as products of finitely many generators), together with &quot;relators&quot;, products of generators that give the identity element. The elements of a group defined in this way are equivalence classes of sequences of generators and their inverses, under an equivalence relation that allows inserting or removing any relator or generator-inverse pair as a contiguous subsequence. The free abelian group with basis formula_1 has a presentation in which the generators are the elements and the relators are the commutators of pairs of elements Here, the commutator of two elements formula_17 and formula_77 is the product setting this product to the identity causes formula_78 to so that formula_17 and formula_77 commute. More generally, if all pairs of generators commute, then all pairs of products of generators also commute. Therefore, the group generated by this presentation is abelian, and the relators of the presentation form a minimal set of relators needed to ensure that it is abelian.

When the set of generators is finite, the presentation of a free abelian group is also finite, because there are only finitely many different commutators to include in the presentation. This fact, together with the fact that every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian (below) can be used to show that every finitely generated abelian group is finitely presented. For, if formula_81 is finitely generated by a it is a quotient of the free abelian group over formula_1 by a free abelian subgroup, the subgroup generated by the relators of the presentation But since this subgroup is itself free abelian, it is also finitely generated, and its basis (together with the commutators forms a finite set of relators for a presentation 

==As a module==
The modules over the integers are defined similarly to vector spaces over the real numbers or rational numbers: they consist of systems of elements that can be added to each other, with an operation for scalar multiplication by integers that is compatible with this addition operation. Every abelian group may be considered as a module over the integers, with a scalar multiplication operation defined as follows:
However, unlike vector spaces, not all abelian groups have a basis, hence the special name &quot;free&quot; for those that do. A free module is a module that can be represented as a direct sum over its base ring, so free abelian groups and free are equivalent concepts: each free abelian group is (with the multiplication operation above) a free and each free comes from a free abelian group in this way. As well as the direct sum, another way to combine free abelian groups is to use the tensor product of The tensor product of two free abelian groups is always free abelian, with a basis that is the Cartesian product of the bases for the two groups in the product.

Many important properties of free abelian groups may be generalized to free modules over a principal ideal domain. For instance, submodules of free modules over principal ideal domains are free, a fact that writes allows for &quot;automatic generalization&quot; of homological machinery to these modules. Additionally, the theorem that every projective is free generalizes in the same way.

==Properties==
===Universal property===
A free abelian group formula_83 with basis formula_1 has the following universal property: for every function formula_61 from formula_1 to an abelian group formula_87, there exists a unique group homomorphism from formula_83 to formula_87 which extends formula_61. Here, a group homomorphism is a mapping from one group to the other that is consistent with the group product law: performing a product before or after the mapping produces the same result. By a general property of universal properties, this shows that &quot;the&quot; abelian group of base formula_1 is unique up to an isomorphism. Therefore, the universal property can be used as a definition of the free abelian group of base formula_1. The uniqueness of the group defined by this property shows that all the other definitions are equivalent.

It is because of this universal property that free abelian groups are called &quot;free&quot;: they are the free objects in the category of abelian groups, the category that has abelian groups as its objects and homomorphisms as its arrows. The map from a basis to its free abelian group is a functor, a structure-preserving mapping of categories, from sets to abelian groups, and is adjoint to the forgetful functor from abelian groups to sets. However, a &quot;free abelian&quot; group is &quot;not&quot; a free group except in two cases: a free abelian group having an empty basis (rank zero, giving the trivial group) or having just one element in the basis (rank one, giving the infinite cyclic group). Other abelian groups are not free groups because in free groups formula_93 must be different from formula_94 if formula_38 and formula_96 are different elements of the basis, while in free abelian groups the two products must be identical for all pairs of elements. In the general category of groups, it is an added constraint to demand that formula_97, whereas this is a necessary property in the category of abelian groups.

===Rank===
Every two bases of the same free abelian group have the same cardinality, so the cardinality of a basis forms an invariant of the group known as its rank. Two free abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank. A free abelian group is finitely generated if and only if its rank is a finite number formula_98, in which case the group is isomorphic to formula_99.

This notion of rank can be generalized, from free abelian groups to abelian groups that are not necessarily free. The rank of an abelian group formula_81 is defined as the rank of a free abelian subgroup formula_83 of formula_81 for which the quotient group formula_103 is a torsion group. Equivalently, it is the cardinality of a maximal subset of formula_81 that generates a free subgroup. The rank is a group invariant: it does not depend on the choice of the subgroup.

===Subgroups===
Every subgroup of a free abelian group is itself a free abelian group. This result of Richard Dedekind was a precursor to the analogous Nielsen–Schreier theorem that every subgroup of a free group is free, and is a generalization of the fact that every nontrivial subgroup of the infinite cyclic group is infinite cyclic. The proof needs the axiom of choice. A proof using Zorn&#x27;s lemma (one of many equivalent assumptions to the axiom of choice) can be found in Serge Lang&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot;. Solomon Lefschetz and Irving Kaplansky argue that using the well-ordering principle in place of Zorn&#x27;s lemma leads to a more intuitive proof.

In the case of finitely generated free abelian groups, the proof is easier, does not need the axiom of choice, and leads to a more precise result. If formula_81 is a subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group formula_83, then formula_81 is free and there exists a basis formula_108 of formula_83 and positive integers formula_110 (that is, each one divides the next one) such that formula_111 is a basis of formula_112 Moreover, the sequence formula_113 depends only on formula_83 and formula_81 and not on the basis. A constructive proof of the existence part of the theorem is provided by any algorithm computing the Smith normal form of a matrix of integers. Uniqueness follows from the fact that, for any formula_116, the greatest common divisor of the minors of rank formula_117 of the matrix is not changed during the Smith normal form computation and is the product formula_118 at the end of the computation.

===Torsion and divisibility===
All free abelian groups are torsion-free, meaning that there is no non-identity group element formula_17 and nonzero integer formula_98 such that formula_121.
Conversely, all finitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free abelian.

The additive group of rational numbers formula_122 provides an example of a torsion-free (but not finitely generated) abelian group that is not free abelian. One reason that formula_122 is not free abelian is that it is divisible, meaning that, for every element formula_124 and every nonzero integer formula_98, it is possible to express formula_17 as a scalar multiple formula_127 of another element formula_128. In contrast, non-trivial free abelian groups are never divisible, because in a free abelian group the basis elements cannot be expressed as multiples of other elements.

===Symmetry===
The symmetries of any group can be described as group automorphisms, the invertible homomorphisms from the group to itself. In non-abelian groups these are further subdivided into inner and outer automorphisms, but in abelian groups all non-identity automorphisms are outer. They form another group, the automorphism group of the given group, under the operation of composition. The automorphism group of a free abelian group of finite rank formula_98 is the general linear group formula_130, which can be described concretely (for a specific basis of the free automorphism group) as the set of formula_131 invertible integer matrices under the operation of matrix multiplication. Their action as symmetries on the free abelian group formula_132 is just matrix-vector multiplication.

The automorphism groups of two infinite-rank free abelian groups have the same first-order theories as each other, if and only if their ranks are equivalent cardinals from the point of view of second-order logic. This result depends on the structure of involutions of free abelian groups, the automorphisms that are their own inverse. Given a basis for a free abelian group, one can find involutions that map any set of disjoint pairs of basis elements to each other, or that negate any chosen subset of basis elements, leaving the other basis elements fixed. Conversely, for every involution of a free abelian group, one can find a basis of the group for which all basis elements are swapped in pairs, negated, or left unchanged by the involution.

===Relation to other groups===
If a free abelian group is a quotient of two groups formula_133, then formula_87 is the direct sum formula_135.

Given an arbitrary abelian group formula_87, there always exists a free abelian group formula_83 and a surjective group homomorphism from formula_83 to formula_87. One way of constructing a surjection onto a given group formula_87 is to let formula_141 be the free abelian group over formula_87, represented as formal sums. Then a surjection can be defined 
by mapping formal sums in formula_83 to the corresponding sums of members of formula_87. That is, the surjection maps
formula_145
where formula_146 is the integer coefficient of basis element formula_65 in a given formal sum,
the first sum is in formula_83, and the second sum is in formula_87. This surjection is the unique group homomorphism which extends the function formula_150, and so its construction can be seen as an instance of the universal property.

When formula_83 and formula_87 are as above, the kernel formula_81 of the surjection from formula_83 to formula_87 is also free abelian, as it is a subgroup of formula_83 (the subgroup of elements mapped to the identity).
Therefore, these groups form a short exact sequence
formula_157
in which formula_83 and formula_81 are both free abelian and formula_87 is isomorphic to the factor group formula_161. This is a free resolution of formula_87. Furthermore, assuming the axiom of choice, the free abelian groups are precisely the projective objects in the category of abelian groups.

==Applications==
===Algebraic topology===

In algebraic topology, a formal sum of formula_163-dimensional simplices is called a formula_163-chain, and the free abelian group having a collection of formula_163-simplices as its basis is called a chain group. The simplices are generally taken from some topological space, for instance as the set of formula_163-simplices in a simplicial complex, or the set of singular formula_163-simplices in a manifold. Any formula_163-dimensional simplex has a boundary that can be represented as a formal sum of formula_169-dimensional simplices, and the universal property of free abelian groups allows this boundary operator to be extended to a group homomorphism from formula_163-chains to formula_169-chains. The system of chain groups linked by boundary operators in this way forms a chain complex, and the study of chain complexes forms the basis of homology theory.

===Algebraic geometry and complex analysis===
Every rational function over the complex numbers can be associated with a signed multiset of complex numbers formula_172, the zeros and poles of the function (points where its value is zero or infinite). The multiplicity formula_173 of a point in this multiset is its order as a zero of the function, or the negation of its order as a pole.
Then the function itself can be recovered from this data, up to a scalar factor, as
formula_174
If these multisets are interpreted as members of a free abelian group over the complex numbers, then the product or quotient of two rational functions corresponds to the sum or difference of two group members. Thus, the multiplicative group of rational functions can be factored into the multiplicative group of complex numbers (the associated scalar factors for each function) and the free abelian group over the complex numbers. The rational functions that have a nonzero limiting value at infinity (the meromorphic functions on the Riemann sphere) form a subgroup of this group in which the sum of the multiplicities is zero.

This construction has been generalized, in algebraic geometry, to the notion of a divisor. There are different definitions of divisors, but in general they form an abstraction of a codimension-one subvariety of an algebraic variety, the set of solution points of a system of polynomial equations. In the case where the system of equations has one degree of freedom (its solutions form an algebraic curve or Riemann surface), a subvariety has codimension one when it consists of isolated points, and in this case a divisor is again a signed multiset of points from the variety. The meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface have finitely many zeros and poles, and their divisors form a subgroup of a free abelian group over the points of the surface, with multiplication or division of functions corresponding to addition or subtraction of group elements. To be a divisor, an element of the free abelian group must have multiplicities summing to zero, and meet certain additional constraints depending on the surface.

===Group rings===
The integral group ring formula_175, for any group formula_81, is a ring whose additive group is the free abelian group over formula_81. When formula_81 is finite and abelian, the multiplicative group of units in formula_175 has the structure of a direct product of a finite group and a finitely generated free abelian group.

<doc id="247302" wikidata="Q7075400" url="?curid=247302" title="Obscene Publications Acts">
<text>Since 1857, a series of obscenity laws known as the Obscene Publications Acts have governed what can be published in England and Wales. The classic definition of criminal obscenity is if it &quot;tends to deprave and corrupt,&quot; stated in 1868 by Lord Justice Cockburn, in &quot;Regina v. Hicklin&quot;, now known as the Hicklin test.

==Timeline of legislation==

There have been several Acts of Parliament of this name: 
* Obscene Publications Act 1857
* Obscene Publications Act 1959
* Obscene Publications Act 1964

Of these, only the 1959 and 1964 acts are still in force in England and Wales, as amended by more recent legislation. They define the legal bounds of obscenity in England and Wales, and are used to enforce the removal of obscene material. Irish law diverged from English law in 1929, replacing the OPA 1857 with a new Irish act.

==Key cases under the Obscene Publications Act==
Scottish prohibitions on obscene material are to be found in section 51 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.

* Pornography in the United Kingdom
* Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 – defines &#x27;extreme pornography&#x27; and details offences

<doc id="247310" wikidata="Q172728" url="?curid=247310" title="Stirling Moss">
<text>Sir Stirling Craufurd Moss (17 September 1929 – 12 April 2020) was a British racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers to never win the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship, Moss won a record 212 official races across several motorsport disciplines, including 16 Formula One Grands Prix. In endurance racing, Moss won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1954, as well as the Mille Miglia in 1955 with Mercedes.

Born and raised in London, Moss was the son of amateur racing driver Alfred Moss and the older brother of rally driver Pat. Aged nine, Alfred bought him an Austin 7, which he raced around the field of the family&#x27;s country house. Initially an equestrian, Moss used his winnings from horse riding competitions to purchase a Cooper 500 in 1948. He was immediately successful in motor racing, taking several wins in Formula Three at national and international levels, prior to his first major victory at the RAC Tourist Trophy in 1950, driving a Jaguar XK120. Moss made his Formula One debut at the 1951 Swiss Grand Prix with HWM, making several intermittent appearances before moving to Maserati in , where he achieved his maiden podium at the . Moss joined Mercedes in , taking his maiden win at the as he finished runner-up in the championship to career rival Juan Manuel Fangio.

Moss again finished runner-up to Fangio in and with Maserati and Vanwall, winning multiple Grands Prix across both seasons. He took four wins in his campaign, but lost out on the title again to Mike Hawthorn by one point. From to , Moss competed for Walker, taking multiple wins in each as he finished third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship three times. Moss retired from motor racing in 1962, after an accident at the non-championship Glover Trophy left him in a coma for a month and temporarily paralysed. He achieved 16 wins, 16 pole positions, 19 fastest laps and 24 podium finishes in Formula One, the former of which remains the record for a non-World Drivers&#x27; Champion. Moss was a three-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, four-time winner of the British Empire Trophy, and five-time winner of the International Gold Cup. He also contested the World Sportscar Championship from 1953 to 1962, winning 12 races with various manufacturers. In rallying, Moss finished runner-up at the Monte Carlo Rally in 1952. Throughout his career, he broke several land speed records across different categories.

In British popular culture, Moss was a widely recognised public figure, with his name becoming synonymous with speed in the mid-20th century. He made several media appearances, including in the James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), and was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1961. Upon retiring from motor racing, Moss established a career as a commentator and pundit for ABC. Moss was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Early life==
Moss was born in London to amateur racing drivers Alfred and Aileen Moss (née Craufurd). His grandfather was Jewish and from a family that changed their surname from Moses to Moss. He was brought up at &quot;Long White Cloud&quot; house on the south bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver, who had come 16th in the 1924 Indianapolis 500, and his mother had also been involved in motorsport, entering into hillclimbs at the wheel of a Singer Nine. Moss was a gifted horse rider, as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who went on to become a successful rally driver.

Moss was educated at several independent schools: Shrewsbury House School, Clewer Manor Junior School, and Haileybury and Imperial Service College. He disliked school and did not get good grades. At Haileybury, he was subjected to bullying due to his Jewish roots. He concealed the bullying from his parents and used it as &quot;motivation to succeed&quot;. Moss received his first car, an Austin 7, from his father at the age of nine and drove it on the fields around Long White Cloud. He purchased his own car at age 15 after he obtained a driving licence.

==Racing career==

Moss raced from 1948 to 1962, winning 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 Formula One Grands Prix. He competed in as many as 62 races in one year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his career. He preferred to race British cars, stating: &quot;It is better to lose honourably in a British car than to win in a foreign one.&quot; At Vanwall, he was instrumental in breaking the German and Italian stranglehold on F1. He kept his record of the most Formula One Grand Prix victories by an English driver until 1991, when Nigel Mansell overtook him.
===1948–1954===
Moss began his career at the wheel of his father&#x27;s 328 BMW, DPX 653. Moss was one of the Cooper Car Company&#x27;s first customers, using winnings from competing in horse-riding events to pay the deposit on a Cooper 500 in 1948. He then persuaded his father, who opposed his son&#x27;s racing career and wanted him to become a dentist, to let him buy it. He soon demonstrated his natural talent and ability with numerous wins at both the national and international levels, and continued to compete in Formula Three, with Coopers and Kiefts, after he had progressed to more senior categories.

His first major international race victory came on the eve of his 21st birthday at the wheel of a Jaguar XK120 in the 1950 RAC Tourist Trophy in Northern Ireland. He went on to win the race six more times, in 1951 (with a Jaguar C-Type), 1955 (with a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR), 1958 and 1959 (with an Aston Martin DBR1), and 1960 and 1961 (with a Ferrari 250 GT). Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari, approached Moss and offered him a Formula Two car to drive at the 1951 Bari Grand Prix before a full-season in 1952. Moss and his father went to Apulia only to find out that the Ferrari car was to be driven by Piero Taruffi and were incensed.

Also a competent rally driver, Moss was one of three people to have won a &quot;Coupe d&#x27;Or&quot; for three consecutive penalty-free runs on the Alpine Rally. He finished second in the 1952 Monte Carlo Rally; driving a Sunbeam-Talbot 90 with Desmond Scannell and John Cooper as his co-drivers. In 1954, he became the first non-American to win the 12 Hours of Sebring, sharing the Cunningham team&#x27;s 1.5-litre O.S.C.A. MT4 with Bill Lloyd.

In 1953, Mercedes-Benz racing boss Alfred Neubauer had spoken to Moss&#x27;s manager, Ken Gregory, about the possibility of Moss&#x27;s joining Mercedes. Having seen him do well in a relatively noncompetitive car, and wanting to see how he would perform in a better one, Neubauer suggested that Moss buy a Maserati for the 1954 season. He bought a Maserati 250F, and although the car&#x27;s unreliability prevented him from scoring high amounts of points in the 1954 Drivers&#x27; Championship, he qualified alongside the Mercedes front runners several times and performed well in the races. He achieved his first Formula One victory when he won the Oulton Park International Gold Cup.

In the Italian Grand Prix, Moss passed both drivers who were regarded as the best in Formula One at the time Juan Manuel Fangio in his Mercedes and Alberto Ascari in his Ferrari and took the lead of the race. Ascari retired with engine problems, and Moss led until lap 68, when his engine also failed. Fangio took the victory, and Moss had to push his Maserati to the finish line. Neubauer, already impressed when Moss had tested a Mercedes-Benz W196 at Hockenheim, promptly signed him for the 1955 season.

===1955===
Moss&#x27;s first World Championship victory came at the 1955 British Grand Prix, a race he was also the first British driver to win. Leading a 1–2–3–4 finish for Mercedes, it was the first time he had beaten Fangio, his teammate, rival, friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio this repeatedly, and Fangio would always reply with: &quot;No. You were just better than me that day.&quot; The same year, Moss also won the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Targa Florio (with Peter Collins), and the Mille Miglia.

====Mille Miglia====
In 1955 Moss won Italy&#x27;s one-thousand-mile Mille Miglia road race, an achievement that Doug Nye described as the &quot;most iconic single day&#x27;s drive in motor racing history&quot;. His co-driver was motor racing journalist Denis Jenkinson, who prepared a set of pace notes for Moss, and the two completed the race in ten hours and seven minutes. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; headlined it as &quot;The Most Epic Drive Ever&quot;. Before the race, he had taken a pill given to him by Fangio, and he has commented that although he did not know what was in it: &quot;Dexedrine and Benzedrine were commonly used in rallies. The object was simply to keep awake, like wartime bomber crews.&quot; After the win, he spent the night and the following day driving his girlfriend to Cologne.

===1956–1962===

Moss won the Nassau Cup at the 1956 and 1957 Bahamas Speed Week. Also in 1957 he won on the longest circuit ever to hold a Formula One Grand Prix, the Pescara Circuit, where, yet again, he demonstrated his mastery in long-distance racing. The event lasted three hours and Moss beat Fangio, who started from pole position, by approximately 3 minutes.

In 1958, Moss&#x27;s forward-thinking attitude made waves in the racing world. Moss won the first race of the season in a rear-engined F1 car, which became the common design by 1961. At Monza that year, he raced in the Maserati 420M in the Race of Two Worlds, the first single-seater car in Europe to be sponsored by a non-racing brand the Eldorado Ice Cream Company. This was the first case in Europe of contemporary sponsorship, with the ice-cream maker&#x27;s colors replacing the ones assigned by the FIA.

Moss&#x27;s sporting attitude cost him the 1958 Formula One World Championship. When rival Mike Hawthorn was threatened with a penalty after the Portuguese Grand Prix, Moss defended him. Hawthorn was accused of reversing on the track after spinning and stalling his car on an uphill section. Moss had shouted advice to Hawthorn to steer downhill, against traffic, to bump-start the car. Moss&#x27;s quick thinking, and his defence of Hawthorn before the stewards, preserved Hawthorn&#x27;s 6 points for finishing in second place. Hawthorn went on to beat Moss for the championship title by one point, even though he had won only one race that year to Moss&#x27;s four. Moss&#x27;s loss in the championship could also be attributed to an error in communication between his pit crew and the driver at one race. A point was given for the fastest lap in each race, and the crew signaled &quot;HAWT REC&quot;, meaning that Hawthorn had set a record lap. Moss read this as &quot;HAWT REG&quot; and thought that Hawthorn was making regular laps, so he did not try to set a fast lap. The crew was supposed to signal the time of the lap, so Moss would know what he had to beat.

Moss was as gifted in sports cars as in Grand Prix cars. To his victories in the Tourist Trophy, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Mille Miglia he added three consecutive wins from 1958 to 1960 in the 1000 km Nürburgring, the first two in an Aston Martin (in which he did most of the driving), and the third in a Maserati Tipo 61, co-driving with Dan Gurney. The pair lost time when an oil hose blew off, but despite the wet-weather, they made up the time and took first place.
In the 1960 Formula One season, Moss won the Monaco Grand Prix in Rob Walker&#x27;s Coventry-Climax-powered Lotus 18. Seriously injured in an accident at the Burnenville curve during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix, he missed the next three races but recovered sufficiently to win the final one of the season, the United States Grand Prix.
For the 1961 Formula One season, run under new 1.5-litre rules, Enzo Ferrari fielded the Ferrari 156 with an all-new V6 engine. Moss&#x27;s Climax-engined Lotus was comparatively underpowered, but he won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix by 3.6 seconds, beating the Ferraris of Richie Ginther, Wolfgang von Trips, and Phil Hill, and he went on to win the 1961 German Grand Prix.

In 1962, Moss crashed his Lotus in the Glover Trophy. The accident put him in a coma for a month, and for six months the left side of his body was paralysed. He recovered but retired from professional racing after a test session in a Lotus 19 the following year, when he lapped a few tenths of a second slower than before. He felt that he had not regained his instinctive command of the car after recovering from the coma. He had been runner-up in the Drivers&#x27; Championship four years in a row, from 1955 to 1958, and third from 1959 to 1961.

==Speed records==
===1950===
At the Autodrome de Montlhéry, a steeply banked oval track near Paris, Moss and Leslie Johnson took turns at the wheel of the latter&#x27;s Jaguar XK120 to average for 24 hours, including stops for fuel and tyres. Changing drivers every three hours, they covered a total of . It was the first time a production car had averaged over for 24 hours.

===1952===

Revisiting Montlhéry, Moss was one of a four-driver team, led by Johnson, who drove a factory-owned Jaguar XK120 fixed-head coupé for 7 days and nights at the French track. Moss, Johnson, Bert Hadley, and Jack Fairman averaged to take four World records and five International Class C records, and covered a total of .

===1957===
In August, Moss broke five International Class F records in the purpose-built MG EX181 at Bonneville Salt Flats. The streamlined, supercharged car&#x27;s speed for the flying kilometre was , which was the average of two runs in opposite directions.

==Broadcasting career==
Away from driving, in 1962 he acted as a colour commentator for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; for Formula One and NASCAR races. He eventually left ABC in 1980. Moss narrated the official 1988 Formula One season review along with Tony Jardine.

Moss also narrated the popular children&#x27;s series &quot;Roary the Racing Car&quot;, which stars Peter Kay.

==Return to racing==


Although ostensibly retired from racing since 1962, Moss did make a number of one-off appearances in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the Holden V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over 2/3 of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson &amp; Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.

In 1980 he made a comeback to regular competition, in the British Saloon Car Championship with the works-backed GTi Engineering Audi team. For the 1980 season Moss was the team&#x27;s number-two driver to team co-owner Richard Lloyd. For the 1981 season Moss stayed with Audi, as the team moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing management, driving alongside Martin Brundle.

Throughout his retirement he raced in events for historic cars, driving on behalf of and at the invitation of others, as well as campaigning his own OSCA FS 372 and other vehicles. In 2004, as part of its promotion for the new SLR, Mercedes-Benz reunited Moss with the 300 SLR &quot;No. 722&quot; in which he won the Mille Miglia nearly 50 years earlier. One reporter who rode with Moss that day noted that the 75-year-old driver was &quot;so good ... that even old and crippled [he was] still better than nearly everyone else&quot;. On 9 June 2011 during qualifying for the Le Mans Legends race, Moss announced on Radio Le Mans that he had finally retired from racing, saying that he had scared himself that afternoon. He was 81.

==Post-racing career==

Lister Cars announced the building for sale of the Lister Knobbly Stirling Moss at the Royal Automobile Club in London in June 2016. The magnesium car is built to the exact specification of the 1958 model, and is the only car that was ever endorsed by Moss. Brian Lister invited Moss to drive for Lister on three separate occasions, at Goodwood in 1954, Silverstone in 1958 and at Sebring in 1959, and to celebrate these races, 10 special-edition lightweight Lister Knobbly cars are being built. The company announced that the cars will be available for both road and race use, and Moss would personally be handing over each car.

===Honours===
In 1990, Moss was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. In the New Year Honours 2000 List, Moss was made a Knight Bachelor for services to motor racing. On 21 March 2000, he was knighted by Prince Charles, standing in for the Queen, who was on an official visit to Australia. He received the 2005 Segrave Trophy.

In 2006, Moss was awarded the FIA gold medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution to motorsport. In December 2008, McLaren-Mercedes unveiled their final model of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. The model was named in honour of Moss, hence, Mercedes McLaren SLR Stirling Moss, which has a top speed of with wind deflectors instead of a windscreen.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modelling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Moss was ranked the 29th best Formula One driver of all time. Following Moss&#x27;s death, the Kinrara Trophy race at the Goodwood Revival meeting was renamed in his honour. It is a race for GT cars that competed before 1963.

=== Biographies ===
In 1957, Moss published an autobiography called &quot;In the Track Of Speed&quot;, first published by Muller, London.
In 1963, motorsport author and commentator Ken Purdy published a biographical book entitled &quot;All But My Life&quot; about Moss (first published by William Kimber &amp; Co, London), based on material gathered through interviews with Moss.
In 2015, when he was aged 85, Moss published a second autobiography, entitled &quot;My Racing Life&quot;, written with motor sports writer Simon Taylor. In 2016, Philip Porter published the first volume of &quot;Stirling Moss The Definitive Biography&quot; covering the period from birth up to the end of 1955, one of Moss&#x27;s greatest years.

===Popular culture===

During his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognised celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. On 12 June the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on &quot;Face to Face&quot;; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed &quot;cold, precise, clinical judgement ... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me&quot;. Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film &quot;The Beauty Jungle&quot; and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. He played Evelyn Tremble&#x27;s (Peter Sellers) driver.

For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase &quot;Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?&quot; was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him. Moss was the subject of a cartoon biography in the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; that said he was interested in cars, women and sex, in that order. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally &quot;hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about&quot;. It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. Although there were complaints to the magazine about the cartoons, Moss telephoned &quot;Private Eye&quot; to ask whether he could use it as a Christmas card.

Moss was one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content. In 2004, Moss was a supporter of the UK Independence Party. He was also a Mercedes-Benz Brand Ambassador, having kept a close relationship with the brand, and remained an enthusiast and collector of the brand, which includes the Mercedes-Benz W113, Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Stirling Moss among others.

==Personal life==

Moss was married three times. His first wife was Katie Molson, an heir to the Canadian brewer Molson. They were married on 7 October 1957 and separated three years later. His second wife was the American public-relations executive Elaine Barbarino. They were married on 25 June 1964 and divorced in 1968. Their daughter Allison was born in late 1966. His third wife was the secretary Susie Paine, the daughter of an old friend. They were married from 1980 until his death in 2020. Their son Elliot was born in 1980. Paine died in March 2023, aged 69.

In April 1960, Moss was found guilty of dangerous driving. He was fined £50 and banned from driving for one year after an incident near Chetwynd, Shropshire, when he was test-driving a Mini. Moss was an accomplished woodworker and craftsman, and participated in the design and construction of several of his own homes.

In 2013, Moss said that if a biopic were made about his life, he would want to be portrayed by “someone masculine – not a poofter or anything like that”. He stood by this comment, saying that he would have to be played by a heterosexual as he had spent his life &quot;chasing crumpet and racing cars&quot;. Moss also believed that women lack the &quot;mental aptitude&quot; for Formula One.

Moss&#x27;s 80th birthday, on 17 September 2009, fell on the eve of the Goodwood Revival and Lord March celebrated with an 80-car parade on each of the three days. Moss drove a different car each day: a Mercedes-Benz W196 (an open-wheel variant), the Lotus 18 in which he had won the 1961 Monaco GP, and an Aston Martin DBR1. On 7 March 2010, Moss broke both ankles and four bones in a foot, and also chipped four vertebrae and suffered skin lesions, when he plunged down a lift shaft at his home. In December 2016, he was admitted to hospital in Singapore with a serious chest infection. As a result of this illness and a subsequent lengthy recovery period, Moss announced his retirement from public life in January 2018.

Moss died of cardio-respiratory failure at his home in Mayfair, London, on 12 April 2020, aged 90, after a long illness.

<doc id="247311" wikidata="Q2748702" url="?curid=247311" title="Department for International Development">
<text>The Department for International Development (DFID) was a ministerial department of the government of the United Kingdom, from 1997 to 2020. It was responsible for administering foreign aid internationally.

The DFID was founded by the UK government in 1997. The department was established by the Labour government under Prime Minister Tony Blair. The structure of the DFID was authored by various Developmental Aid Experts including Chris Collins, Barnaby Edwards Machteld, Nicolas Brown and Timothy Montague Hamilton Douglas.

The goal of the department was &quot;to promote sustainable development and eliminate world poverty&quot;. DFID was headed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secretary of State for International Development. The position was last held by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who assumed office on 13 February 2020 and served until the department was dissolved on 2 September 2020. In a 2010 report by the Development Assistance Committee, the department was described as &quot;an international development leader in times of global crisis&quot;. The UK aid logo is often used to publicly acknowledge DFID&#x27;s development programmes are funded by UK taxpayers.

The DFID&#x27;s main programme areas of work were Education, Health, Social Services, Water Supply and Sanitation, Government and Civil Society, Economic Sector (including Infrastructure, Production Sectors and Developing Planning), Environment Protection, Research, and Humanitarian Assistance.

In June 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the DFID was to be merged with the Foreign Office to create the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

The department was scrutinized by the International Development Committee.

Following Labour&#x27;s 2024 ascension to government, there has been speculation that DFID could be reestablished as a ministry of its own once more. However, since the General Election, the new Government has not yet committed to this.

==Secretaries of State==
The final permanent secretary was Matthew Rycroft, who assumed office in January 2018.

==Mission==
The main piece of legislation governing the department&#x27;s work was the International Development Act 2002, which came into force on 17 June 2002, replacing the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980. The Act made poverty reduction the focus of the department&#x27;s work, and effectively outlawed tied aid.

As well as responding to disasters and emergencies, the department worked to support the United Nations&#x27; eight Millennium Development Goals with a 2015 deadline, namely to:
*Halve the number of people living in extreme poverty and hunger
*Ensure that all children receive primary education
*Promote sexual equality and give women a stronger voice
*Reduce child death rates
*Improve the health of mothers
*Combat HIV &amp; AIDS, malaria and other diseases
*Make sure the environment is protected
*Build a global partnership for those working in development.

==History==

The department had its origins in the &quot;Ministry of Overseas Development&quot; created during the Labour government of 1964–1970, which combined the functions of the Department of Technical Cooperation and the overseas aid policy functions of the Foreign, Commonwealth Relations, and Colonial Offices and of other government departments.

Over its history, the Department for International Development and its predecessors have been independent departments or part of the Foreign Office. 
After the election of a Conservative government in October 1970, the Ministry of Overseas Development was renamed the &quot;Overseas Development Administration&quot; (ODA) and incorporated into the Foreign Office. The ODA was overseen by a minister of state in the Foreign Office who was accountable to the Foreign Secretary. Though it became a section of the Foreign Office, the ODA was relatively self-contained with its own minister, and the policies, procedures, and staff remained largely intact.

When a Labour government was returned to office in 1974, it announced that there would once again be a separate &quot;Ministry of Overseas Development&quot; with its own minister. From June 1975 the powers of the minister for overseas development were formally transferred to the Foreign Secretary.

In 1977, partly to shore up its difficult relations with UK business, the government introduced the Aid and Trade Provision. This enabled aid to be linked to nonconcessionary export credits, with both aid and export credits tied to procurement of British goods and services. Pressure for this provision from UK businesses and the Department of Trade and Industry arose in part because of the introduction of French mixed credit programmes, which had begun to offer French government support from aid funds for exports, including for projects in countries to which France had not previously given substantial aid.

After the election of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher in 1979, the ministry was transferred back to the Foreign Office, as a functional wing again named the Overseas Development Administration. The ODA continued to be represented in the cabinet by the Foreign Secretary while the Minister for Overseas Development, who had day-to-day responsibility for development matters, held the rank of minister of state within the Foreign Office.
In the early 1980s, part of the agency&#x27;s operations was relocated to East Kilbride in Scotland, with a view to creating jobs in an area subject to long-term industrial decline.

In 1997, the department was separated again from the Foreign Office, when a Labour government returned under Tony Blair. Labour also reduced the amount of aid tied to purchasing British goods and services, which had often led to aid being spent ineffectually.
In September 2020, the department and the Foreign Office were yet again merged to form the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office by Boris Johnson&#x27;s Conservative government.

The DFID or ODA&#x27;s role has been under:

As of 2008, along with the Nordic countries, the DFID generally avoided setting up its own programmes, in order to avoid creating unnecessary bureaucracy. To achieve this, the DFID distributed most of its money to governments and other international organisations that had already developed suitable programmes, and let them distribute the money as efficiently as possible. In July 2009, the DFID rebranded all its aid programmes with the &quot;UK aid&quot; logo, to make clear the contributions were coming from the people of the United Kingdom. While the decision was met with some controversy among aid workers at the time, Commons International Development Select Committee Chairman Malcolm Bruce explained the rebranding, saying &quot;the name DFID does not reflect the fact that this is a British organisation; it could be anything. The Americans have USAID, Canada has got CIDA.&quot;

The 2009 National Audit Office Performance Management review looked at how the DFID had restructured its performance management arrangements over the last six years. The report responded to a request from the DFID&#x27;s Accounting Officer to re-visit the topic periodically, which the Comptroller and Auditor General agreed would be valuable. The study found that the DFID had improved in its general scrutiny of progress in reducing poverty and of progress towards divisional goals, however noted that there was still clear scope for further improvement.

In 2016, the DFID was taken to task with accusations of misappropriation of funding in the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. Whistleblower Sean McLaughlin commenced legal action against the department in the Eastern Caribbean Court, questioning the DFID fraud investigation process.

In June 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would be brought together to form the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office from 1 September the same year, centralising oversight of Britain&#x27;s foreign aid budget. The stated aim, according to Johnson, was to &quot;unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort&quot;. Three former British Prime Ministers (David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair) criticised the plan. Johnson merged the two departments together in September 2020, forming the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. In criticism of the merge, Opposition leader Keir Starmer kept the shadow department and its ministers in place until the November 2021 shadow cabinet reshuffle.

===Pergau Dam===
When it was the Overseas Development Administration, a scandal erupted concerning the department&#x27;s funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border. Building work had begun in 1991 with money from the British foreign aid budget. Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion worth of arms from British dealers, and thus became the subject of a UK government inquiry from March 1994.

===Ethiopia===
In February 2015, the DFID ended its financial support for a controversial development project alleged to have helped the Ethiopian government fund a brutal resettlement programme. Four million people were forced off their land by security forces while their homes and farms were sold to foreign investors.

In early 2017 the department ended £5.2m of support for the all-girl Ethiopian acting and pop group Yegna, called &quot;Ethiopia&#x27;s Spice Girls&quot;, citing concerns about the effectiveness and value for money of the programme.

==Budget==


In 2009/10, the DFID&#x27;s Gross Public Expenditure on Development was £6.65bn. Of this £3.96bn was spent on Bilateral Aid (including debt relief, humanitarian assistance and project funding) and £2.46bn was spent on Multilateral Aid, including support to the EU, World Bank, UN and other related agencies. Although the Department for International Development&#x27;s foreign aid budget was not affected by the cuts outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x27;s 2010 spending review, DFID saw their administration budgets slashed by about 19 per cent over the next four years, a reduction in back-office costs to account for only 2 per cent of their total spend by 2015.

In 2010, the DFID was criticised for spending around £15 million a year in the UK, although this only accounted for 0.25% of its total budget. In 2010, £1.85 million had been given to the Foreign Office to fund the Papal visit of Pope Benedict, although a department spokesman said that &quot;The contribution recognised the Catholic Church&#x27;s role as a major provider of health and education services in developing countries&quot;. There has also been criticism of some spending by international organisations with UNESCO and the FAO being particularly weak. 
In 2010 the incoming coalition government promised to reduce back-office costs to only 2% of the budget and to improve transparency by publishing more on their website.
In 2011, the government were also criticised for increasing the aid budget at a time where other departments were being cut. The head of the conservative pressure group TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance said that &quot;The department should at least get the same treatment other high priority areas like science did – a cash freeze would save billions.&quot;
The budget for 2011–12 was £6.7 billion including £1.4 billion of capital.

In June 2013, as part of the 2013 Spending Round outcomes it was announced that the DFID&#x27;s total programme budget would increase to £10.3bn in 2014/15 and £11.1bn in 2015/16 to help meet the government&#x27;s commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on official development assistance. The DFID was responsible for the majority of Britain&#x27;s official development assistance, projected to total £11.7bn in 2014/15 and £12.2bn in 2015/16.

On 1 April 2015, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, a fund of more than £1 billion per year for tackling conflict and instability abroad, was created under the control of the National Security Council, and £823 million was transferred from the DFID budget to the fund, £739 million of which was then administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and £42 million by the Ministry of Defence. Subsequently, concern was expressed in the media that Britain&#x27;s aid budget was being spent on defence and foreign policy objectives and to support the work of other departments.

In November 2015, the DFID released a new policy document titled &quot;UK aid: tackling global challenges in the national interest&quot;.

According to the OECD, the official development assistance from the United Kingdom increased to USD 15.7 billion (preliminary data) in 2022 due to an increase in gross national income and additional funding for in-donor refugee costs. Official development assistance represented 0.51% of gross national income.

===International grants table===
The following table lists committed funding from the DFID for the top 15 sectors, as recorded in the department&#x27;s International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) publications. The DFID joined the IATI in January 2011 but also records grants before that point. The sectors use the names from the DAC 5 Digit Sector list.

== DFID research ==
The DFID was the largest bilateral donor of development-focused research. New science, technologies and ideas were crucial for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, but global research investments were insufficient to match needs and do not focus on the priorities of the poor. Many technological and policy innovations required an international scale of research effort. For example, the DFID was a major donor to the International LUBILOSA programme, which developed a biological pesticide for locust control in support of small-holder farmers in the Sahel.

DFID Research commissioned research to help fill this gap, aiming to ensure tangible outcomes on the livelihoods of the poor worldwide. They also sought to influence the international and UK research agendas, putting poverty reduction and the needs of the poor at the forefront of global research efforts.

DFID Research managed long-term research initiatives that cut across individual countries or regions, and only funded activities if there was clear opportunities and mechanisms for the research to have a significant impact on poverty.

Research was funded through a range of mechanisms, including Research Programme Consortia, jointly with other funders of development research, with UK Research Councils and with multilateral agencies (such as the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, World Health Organisation). Information on both DFID current research programmes and completed research can be found on the (R4D) portal Research4Development. From November 2012 all new DFID-funded research was subjected to its DFID Research Open and Enhanced Access Policy. International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell declared that this will ensure &quot;that these findings get into the hands of those inh the developing world who stand to gain most from putting them into practical use&quot;.

The DFID launched its first Research Strategy in April 2008. This emphasised the DFID&#x27;s commitment to funding high quality research that aims to find solutions and ways of reducing global poverty. The new strategy identified six priorities:

*Growth
*Health
*Sustainable agriculture
*Climate change
*Governance in challenging environments
*Future challenges and opportunities

The strategy also highlighted three important cross-cutting areas, where the DFID would invest more funding:

*Capacity building
*Research communication and uptake
*Stimulating demand for research

<doc id="247315" wikidata="Q201610" url="?curid=247315" title="Status quo">
<text> is a Latin phrase meaning the existing state of affairs, particularly with regard to social, economic, legal, environmental, political, religious, scientific or military issues. In the sociological sense, the &quot;status quo&quot; refers to the current state of social structure or values. With regard to policy debate, it means how conditions are contrasted with a possible change. For example: &quot;The countries are now trying to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; with regard to their nuclear arsenals.&quot; To maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; is to keep things the way they presently are.

The related phrase &quot;&quot;, literally &#x27;the status before&#x27;, refers to the state of affairs that existed previously.

== Political usage ==

The status quo may be changed via social movements. These seek to alleviate or prevent a particular issue and often to shape social feeling and cultural expression of a society or nation.

Advocating to improve the status quo is a persuasive rhetorical device. This is sometimes critiqued as a policy of deliberate ambiguity as not formalizing or defining the adverse situation. 

Economist Clark Kerr reportedly said: &quot;The status quo is the only solution that cannot be vetoed.&quot;

Karl Marx viewed organized religion as a means for the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content with an unequal status quo.

<text>Ravensburg is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southeast of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from southwest clockwise) Bodensee, Sigmaringen and Biberach, the Bavarian urban district Memmingen and the districts Unterallgäu, Oberallgäu and Lindau.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Ravensburg&quot;, which was created in 1810 when the previously free imperial city Ravensburg and the surrounding area became part of Württemberg. In 1938 the Oberamt was converted into a district and most of the &quot;Oberamt Waldsee&quot; was merged into the new district. In 1973 the district Wangen was merged into the district, together with a few municipalities from the district Saulgau, Überlingen and Biberach.
The district is also home to the toymaker Ravensburger.

==Geography==
The landscape of the district consists of the &quot;Oberschwäbischen Hügelland&quot; and &quot;Westallgäuer Hügelland&quot; hils.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show a Lion, the symbol of the Welfen family. This family had their center in Ravensburg, before the area went to the Hohenstaufen family.

<doc id="247323" wikidata="Q910550" url="?curid=247323" title="Stirling cycle">
<text>The Stirling cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that describes the general class of Stirling devices. This includes the original Stirling engine that was invented, developed and patented in 1816 by Robert Stirling with help from his brother, an engineer.

The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are not totally reversible because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isochoric/isobaric heat-addition and heat-rejection processes. The irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles less than that of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Stirling cycle, which is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-volume regeneration processes.

The cycle is reversible, meaning that if supplied with mechanical power, it can function as a heat pump for heating or cooling, and even for cryogenic cooling. The cycle is defined as a closed regenerative cycle with a gaseous working fluid. &quot;Closed cycle&quot; means the working fluid is permanently contained within the thermodynamic system. This also categorizes the engine device as an external heat engine. &quot;Regenerative&quot; refers to the use of an internal heat exchanger called a regenerator which increases the device&#x27;s thermal efficiency.

The cycle is the same as most other heat cycles in that there are four main processes: compression, heat addition, expansion, and heat removal. However, these processes are not discrete, but rather the transitions overlap.

The Stirling cycle is a highly advanced subject that has defied analysis by many experts for over 190 years. Highly advanced thermodynamics is required to describe the cycle. Professor Israel Urieli writes: &quot;...the various &#x27;ideal&#x27; cycles (such as the Schmidt cycle) are neither physically realizable nor representative of the Stirling cycle&quot;.

The analytical problem of the regenerator (the central heat exchanger in the Stirling cycle) is judged by Jakob to rank &quot;among the most difficult and involved that are encountered in engineering&quot;.

==Idealized Stirling cycle thermodynamics==
The idealized Stirling cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid (See diagram to right):

==Piston motion variations==

Most thermodynamics textbooks describe a highly simplified form of Stirling cycle consisting of four processes. This is known as an &quot;ideal Stirling cycle&quot;, because it is an &quot;idealized&quot; model, and not necessarily an optimized cycle. Theoretically, the &quot;ideal cycle&quot; does have high net work output, but it is rarely used in practical applications, in part because other cycles are simpler or reduce peak stresses on bearings and other components. For convenience, the designer may elect to use piston motions dictated by system dynamics, such as mechanical linkage mechanisms. At any rate, the efficiency and cycle &quot;power&quot; are nearly as good as an actual implementation of the idealized case. A typical piston crank or linkage in a so named &quot;kinematic&quot; design often results in a near-sinusoidal piston motion. Some designs will cause the piston to &quot;dwell&quot; at either extreme of travel.

Many kinematic linkages, such as the well known &quot;Ross yoke&quot;, will exhibit near-sinusoidal motion. However, other linkages, such as the &quot;rhombic drive&quot;, will exhibit more non-sinusoidal motion. To a lesser extent, the ideal cycle introduces complications, since it would require somewhat higher piston acceleration and higher viscous pumping losses of the working fluid. The material stresses and pumping losses in an optimized engine, however, would only be intolerable when approaching the &quot;ideal cycle&quot; and/or at high cycle rates. Other issues include the time required for heat transfer, particularly for the isothermal processes. In an engine with a cycle approaching the &quot;ideal cycle&quot;, the cycle rate might have to be reduced to address these issues.

In the most basic model of a free piston device, the kinematics will result in simple harmonic motion.

==Volume variations==
In beta and gamma engines, generally the phase angle difference between the piston motions is &quot;not&quot; the same as the phase angle of the volume variations. However, in the alpha Stirling, they are the same. The rest of the article assumes sinusoidal volume variations, as in an alpha Stirling with co-linear pistons, so named an &quot;opposed piston&quot; alpha device. 

caveat: Among the many inaccuracies in this article, a co-linear alpha configuration is referenced, above. Such a configuration would be beta. Alternatively, it would be an alpha, that has an unacceptably inefficient linkage system.

== Pressure-versus-volume graph ==
This type of plot is used to characterize almost all thermodynamic cycles. The result of sinusoidal volume variations is the quasi-elliptical shaped cycle shown in Figure 1. Compared to the idealized cycle, this cycle is a more realistic representation of most real Stirling engines. The four points in the graph indicate the crank angle in degrees.

The &quot;adiabatic&quot; Stirling cycle is similar to the idealized Stirling cycle; however, the four thermodynamic processes are slightly different (see graph above):
* 180° to 270°, pseudo-isothermal expansion. The expansion space is heated externally, and the gas undergoes near-isothermal expansion.
* 270° to 0°, near-constant-volume (or near-isometric or isochoric) heat removal. The gas is passed through the regenerator, thus cooling the gas, and transferring heat to the regenerator for use in the next cycle.
* 0° to 90°, pseudo-isothermal compression. The compression space is intercooled, so the gas undergoes near-isothermal compression.
* 90° to 180°, near-constant-volume (near-isometric or isochoric) heat addition. The compressed air flows back through the regenerator and picks up heat on the way to the heated expansion space.

With the exception of a Stirling thermoacoustic engine, none of the gas particles actually flow through the complete cycle. So this approach is not amenable to further analysis of the cycle. However, it provides an overview and indicates the cycle work.

==Particle/mass motion==
Figure 2 shows the streaklines which indicate how gas flows through a real Stirling engine. The vertical colored lines delineate the volumes of the engine. From left to right, they are: the volume swept by the expansion (power) piston, the clearance volume (which prevents the piston from contacting the hot heat exchanger), the heater, the regenerator, the cooler, the cooler clearance volume, and the compression volume swept by the compression piston.

==Heat-exchanger pressure drop==
Also referred to as &quot;pumping losses&quot;, the pressure drops shown in Figure 3 are caused by viscous flow through the heat exchangers. The red line represents the heater, green is the regenerator, and blue is the cooler. To properly design the heat exchangers, multivariate optimization is required to obtain sufficient heat transfer with acceptable flow losses. The flow losses shown here are relatively low, and they are barely visible in the following image, which will show the overall pressure variations in the cycle.

==Pressure versus crank angle==
Figure 4 shows results from an &quot;adiabatic simulation&quot; with non-ideal heat exchangers. Note that the pressure drop across the regenerator is very low compared to the overall pressure variation in the cycle.

==Temperature versus crank angle==
Figure 5 illustrates the adiabatic properties of a real heat exchanger. The straight lines represent the temperatures of the solid portion of the heat exchanger, and the curves are the gas temperatures of the respective spaces. The gas temperature fluctuations are caused by the effects of compression and expansion in the engine, together with non-ideal heat exchangers which have a limited rate of heat transfer. When the gas temperature deviates above and below the heat exchanger temperature, it causes thermodynamic losses known as &quot;heat transfer losses&quot; or &quot;hysteresis losses&quot;. However, the heat exchangers still work well enough to allow the real cycle to be effective, even if the actual thermal efficiency of the overall system is only about half of the theoretical limit.

==Cumulative heat and work energy==
Figure 6 shows a graph of the alpha-type Stirling engine data, where &#x27;Q&#x27; denotes heat energy, and &#x27;W&#x27; denotes work energy. The blue dotted line shows the work output of the compression space. As the trace dips down, work is done on the gas as it is compressed. During the expansion process of the cycle, some work is actually done &quot;on&quot; the compression piston, as reflected by the upward movement of the trace. At the end of the cycle, this value is negative, indicating that compression piston requires a net input of work. The blue solid line shows the heat flowing out of the cooler heat exchanger. The heat from the cooler and the work from the compression piston have the same cycle energy. This is consistent with the zero-net heat transfer of the regenerator (solid green line). As would be expected, the heater and the expansion space both have positive energy flow. The black dotted line shows the net work output of the cycle. On this trace, the cycle ends higher than it started, indicating that the heat engine converts energy from heat into work.

<text>Pierre Eugène Alfred Bouillin (22 December 1905 – 11 June 1955) was a French sportsman and racing driver. He took the racing name Pierre Levegh in memory of his uncle Alfred Velghe, a pioneering driver who died in 1904. Levegh died in the 1955 Le Mans disaster which also killed 83 spectators during the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans automobile race.

==Career==
Levegh, who was born in Paris, France, was also an ice hockey and tennis player. In motorsport he competed in Formula One for the Talbot-Lago team in 1950 and 1951, starting six races, retiring in three, and scoring no points.

At Le Mans he raced for Talbot in four races, finishing fourth in 1951. In 1952, driving single-handedly, his car suffered an engine failure in the last hour of the race with a four lap lead. The failure was due to a bolt in the central crankshaft bearing having come loose many hours earlier in the race, although many fans placed the blame on driver fatigue. Levegh had refused to let his co-driver take over because he felt only he could nurse the car home. In 1953 he came in eighth, and in 1954 he was involved in an accident in the seventh hour of racing.

== Death ==

In 1955, he was tempted away from Talbot and joined the American John Fitch in racing a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. During the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in the third hour of racing, while on the Tribunes Straight, the Jaguar D-Type of Mike Hawthorn cut into the pits, slowing in front of the Austin-Healey 100S of Lance Macklin. Macklin was forced to make an evasive move away from Hawthorn, pulling across the track into the way of Levegh&#x27;s faster Mercedes running just in front of Mercedes teammate Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio. Running up the side of Macklin&#x27;s car, Levegh&#x27;s car launched into the air, striking high on a retaining wall, disintegrating and scattering components into the crowd. Levegh was killed when he was flung from his car and his skull crushed by the landing impact. The flammable magnesium body of the Mercedes quickly ignited in the accident; the combination of the fire and flying car parts killed 83 spectators with over 100 injured. The race was continued in order to avoid a mass exodus of spectators, which would have blocked all access roads needed for use by the responding ambulances.

Levegh may have saved the life of five-time Formula One World Champion Fangio, who maintained that a hand-signal from Levegh to slow down moments before he struck Macklin&#x27;s car was a deliberate warning, which saved Fangio from also crashing.

Mercedes withdrew from the race as a sign of respect to the victims, while Mike Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb continued in their Jaguars to win the race.

The accident was a major contributor to changing attitudes about the acceptance of danger in motor racing and an increase in the desire to make courses safer for spectators and drivers alike.
Most notably, Mercedes stopped all motor racing activities for the next 30 years.
Likewise the small British firm of Bristol Cars, whose entrants achieved a 1–2–3 finish in the 2-litre class at Le Mans that year, decided to abandon racing altogether as a result of the tragedy, scrapping all but one of their racing cars. Fitch became a safety advocate and began research into automotive safety, some of which have advanced into motorsport.

Levegh is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<doc id="247326" wikidata="Q107749" url="?curid=247326" title="Volcanic glass">
<text>Volcanic glass is the amorphous (uncrystallized) product of rapidly cooling magma. Like all types of glass, it is a state of matter intermediate between the closely packed, highly ordered array of a crystal and the highly disordered array of liquid. Volcanic glass may refer to the interstitial material, or matrix, in an aphanitic (fine-grained) volcanic rock, or to any of several types of vitreous igneous rocks.

==Origin==
Volcanic glass is formed when magma is rapidly cooled. Magma rapidly cooled to below its normal crystallization temperature becomes a supercooled liquid, and, with further rapid cooling, this becomes an amorphous solid. The change from supercooled liquid to glass occurs at a temperature called the glass transition temperature, which depends on both cooling rate and the amount of water dissolved in the magma. Magma rich in silica and poor in dissolved water is most easily cooled rapidly enough to form volcanic glass. As a result, rhyolite magmas, which are high in silica, can produce tephra composed entirely of volcanic glass and may also form glassy lava flows. Ash-flow tuffs typically consist of countless microscopic shards of volcanic glass. Basalt, which is low in silica, forms glass only with difficulty, so that basalt tephra almost always contains at least some crystalline material (&quot;quench crystals&quot;). The glass transition temperature of basalt is about .

The mechanisms controlling formation of volcanic glass are further illustrated by the two forms of basaltic glass, tachylite and sideromelane. Tachylite is opaque to transmitted light because of the abundance of tiny oxide mineral crystals suspended in the glass. Sideromelane is partially transparent because it contains much fewer crystals. Sideromelane is abundant only in eruptions where basalt magma has been very rapidly cooled by contact with water, such as phreatomagmatic eruptions. Basaltic volcanic glass is also present in pillow lavas.

Of the cooling mechanisms responsible for forming volcanic glass, the most effective is quenching by water, followed by cooling by entrained air in an eruption column. The least effective mechanism is cooling at the bottom of a flow in contact with the ground.

==Types==
Most commonly, &quot;volcanic glass&quot; refers to &quot;obsidian&quot;, a rhyolitic glass with high silica (SiO2) content.

Other types of volcanic glass include the following:

* Pumice, which is considered a glass because it has no crystal structure.
* Apache tears, a kind of nodular obsidian.
* Tachylite (also spelled tachylyte), a basaltic glass with relatively low silica content.
* Sideromelane, a less common form of tachylyte.
* Palagonite, an alteration product of basaltic glass.
* Hyaloclastite, a hydrated tuff-like breccia of sideromelane and palagonite.
* Pele&#x27;s hair, threads or fibers of volcanic glass, usually basaltic.
* Pele&#x27;s tears, tear-like drops of volcanic glass, usually basaltic.
* Limu o Pele (Pele&#x27;s seaweed), thin sheets and flakes of brownish-green to near-clear volcanic glass, usually basaltic.

==Alteration==
Volcanic glass is chemically unstable and readily decomposes. Water molecules readily react with the open, disordered structure of volcanic glass, removing soluble cations from the glass and precipitating secondary (&quot;authigenic&quot;) minerals. As a result, lithification of volcanic ash is one of the fastest low-temperature lithification processes. Alteration of volcanic glass at mid-ocean ridges may have contributed significantly to the formation of massive sulfide deposits, and alteration of volcanic ash beds formed economically important zeolite and bentonite deposits.

<doc id="247331" wikidata="Q212234" url="?curid=247331" title="Treaty of Roskilde">
<text>The Treaty of Roskilde was negotiated at Høje Taastrup Church and was concluded on 26 February (OS) or 8 March 1658 (NS) during the Second Northern War between Frederick III of Denmark–Norway and Karl X Gustav of Sweden in the Danish city of Roskilde. After a devastating defeat, Denmark–Norway was forced to give up a third of its territory to save the rest, the ceded lands comprising Blekinge, Bornholm, Bohuslän, Scania and Trøndelag, as well as Halland.

After the treaty entered into force, Swedish forces continued to campaign in the remainder of Denmark–Norway, but had to withdraw from the Danish isles and Trøndelag in the face of a Dano–Norwegian and Dutch alliance. The Treaty of Copenhagen restored Bornholm to Denmark and Trøndelag to Norway in 1660, while the other provinces transferred in Roskilde remained Swedish.

==Background==

As the Northern Wars progressed, Charles X Gustav of Sweden crossed the frozen straits from Jutland and occupied the Danish island of Zealand, with the invasion beginning on 11 February 1658. A preliminary treaty, the Treaty of Taastrup, was signed on 18 February 1658 with the final treaty, the Treaty of Roskilde, signed on 26 February 1658.

==Provisions==
The treaty&#x27;s conditions included:
*The immediate cession of the Danish province Scania to Sweden.
*The immediate cession of the Danish province Blekinge to Sweden.
*The immediate cession of the Danish province Halland to Sweden. Under the terms of the prior 1645 Peace of Brömsebro, Halland was on lease to Sweden for a term of 30 years.
*The immediate cession of the Danish province of Bornholm to Sweden.
*The immediate cession of the Norwegian province of Bohuslän to Sweden. This effectively secured for Sweden unrestricted access to western trade.
*The immediate cession of the Norwegian province of Trøndelag, then including Nordmøre and Romsdal, to Sweden.
*Danish renunciation of all anti-Swedish alliances.
*Danish prevention of any warships hostile to Sweden passing through the straits into the Baltic.
*Restoration of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp to his estates.
*Danish payment for Swedish occupation forces costs.
*Danish provision of troops to serve Charles in his broader wars.

==Aftermath==

===Copenhagen===
The Swedish king was not content with his stunning victory. At the Swedish Council held at Gottorp on 7 July, Charles X Gustav resolved to wipe his inconvenient rival from the map of Europe. Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, he ordered his troops to attack Denmark–Norway a second time. There followed an attack on the capital Copenhagen. Residents successfully defended themselves with help from the Dutch, who honored their 1649 treaty to defend Denmark against unprovoked invasion by sending an expeditionary fleet and army, defeating the Swedish fleet in the Battle of the Sound and relieving the capital. His army partly trapped at Landskrona and partly isolated on the Danish islands by superior Danish and Dutch forces under Vice-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, Charles was forced to withdraw in 1659.

===Bornholm and Trøndelag===
Sweden also invaded Romsdal in western Norway. The local farmers rebelled and defied the Swedish taxes and military conscription vigorously. The Swedish governor was forced to send a full company of soldiers and 50 cavalry to collect taxes. The action was not successful, and the area remained largely autonomous.

Meanwhile, Norwegian forces succeeded in expelling the Swedish occupiers from Trøndelag. Eventually, the resulting Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 restored Trøndelag to Norway, and the island of Bornholm to Denmark.

The relinquishment of Trøndelag by the Treaty of Copenhagen reflects strong local resistance to the Swedish occupation. Although the Swedish invasion had been welcomed, or at least not resisted, the Swedes issued conscription orders in Trøndelag and forced 2,000 men and boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting in Poland and Brandenburg. King Carl X Gustav was afraid that the Trønders would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away.

Only about one third of the men ever returned to their homes. Some of them were forced to settle in the Swedish province of Estonia, as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Trønders there. Many of Trøndelag&#x27;s men were already in the Dano-Norwegian army and navy, so the Swedish-forced conscription nearly emptied Trøndelag of males. The result was devastating, as the farms were left without enough hands to harvest the fields, and famine struck the region. Some local historians of Trøndelag have termed this the genocide of the Trønders.

The few months of experience with Swedish taxation and conscription left such bitter sentiments, that it served to strengthen Dano-Norwegian unity and patriotism, making resistance to Swedish invasions of Denmark–Norway stronger over the next 80 years.

===Scania===

In the ninth article of the Treaty of Roskilde, which ceded Scania (&quot;Skåne&quot;), the inhabitants of the Scanian lands were assured of their privileges, old laws and customs. However the territories were gradually integrated in the Swedish realm. The nobility was soon amalgamated with the Swedish nobility and introduced into the Swedish House of Lords with the same rights and privileges as the original Swedish noble families.

In 1676 Denmark attacked and conquered most of Scania in an attempt to take back the province, but Sweden reconquered it. The provincial Scanian Law was replaced by the national Swedish law in 1683. In the same year the national Danish law came into force in Denmark, also replacing provincial laws there. The Swedish Church Ordinance was introduced in 1686.

<text>Pacific Islanders, Pasifika, Pasefika, Pacificans, or rarely Pacificers are the peoples of the Pacific Islands. As an ethnic/racial term, it is used to describe the original peoples—inhabitants and diasporas—of any of the three major subregions of Oceania (Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia) or any other island located in the Pacific Ocean.

Melanesians include the Fijians (Fiji), Kanaks (New Caledonia), Ni-Vanuatu (Vanuatu), Papua New Guineans (Papua New Guinea), Solomon Islanders (Solomon Islands), West Papuans (Indonesia&#x27;s West Papua) and Moluccans (Indonesia&#x27;s Maluku Islands).

Micronesians include the Carolinians (Caroline Islands), Chamorros (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands), Chuukese (Chuuk), I-Kiribati (Kiribati), Kosraeans (Kosrae), Marshallese (Marshall Islands), Palauans (Palau), Pohnpeians (Pohnpei), and Yapese (Yap).

Polynesians include the New Zealand Māori (New Zealand), Native Hawaiians (Hawaii), Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Samoans (Samoa and American Samoa), Tahitians (Tahiti), Tokelauans (Tokelau), Niueans (Niue), Cook Islands Māori (Cook Islands), Tongans (Tonga), Wallisians, and Futunans (Wallis and Futuna). The term &quot;Pasifika&quot; was first used in New Zealand to designate the non-indigenous ethnic groups arriving from the aforementioned Pacific nations, excluding New Zealand itself; this term, when used in New Zealand, does not encompass the indigenous Māori people.

Auckland in New Zealand has the world&#x27;s largest concentration of urban Pacific Islanders living outside of their own countries, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Polynesian capital of the world.&quot; This came as result of a steady stream of immigration from Polynesian countries such as Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Niue, and French Polynesia in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The umbrella terms &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; and &quot;Pacific Islanders&quot; may also take on several other meanings. At times, the term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; only refers to islands within the cultural regions of Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia, and to tropical islands with oceanic geology in general, such as Clipperton Island. In some common uses, the term refers to the islands of the Pacific Ocean once colonized by the Portuguese, Spaniards, Dutch, British, French, Germans, Americans, Japanese, and Chinese. In other uses, it may refer to areas with Austronesian linguistic heritage like Taiwan, Indonesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and the Myanmar islands, which found their genesis in the Neolithic cultures of the island of Taiwan. In an often geopolitical context, the term has been extended even further to include the large South Pacific landmass of Australia.

==Extent==

In the North Pacific, non-tropical islands in and around Alaska, Japan, and Russia were inhabited by people related to Indigenous American and Far East Asian groups, with some Japanese ethnic groups also being theorized to be related to Indigenous Pacific groups. In the South Pacific, the easternmost oceanic island with any human inhabitation was Easter Island, settled by the Polynesian Rapa Nui people. Oceanic islands beyond that which neighbor Central America and South America (Galápagos, Revillagigedo, Juan Fernández Islands etc.) are among the last inhabitable places on earth to have been discovered by humans. All of these islands (excluding Clipperton) were annexed by Latin American nations a few hundred years after their discoveries, and initially were sometimes used as prisons for convicts. Today only a small number of them are inhabited, mainly by Spanish-speaking mainlanders of mestizo or White Latin American origin. These individuals are not considered Pacific Islanders under the standard ethnically based definition. In a broad sense, they could still possibly be seen as encompassing a small Spanish-speaking segment of Oceania, along with the Easter Island inhabitants, who were eventually colonized by Chileans. The 1996 book &quot;Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas&quot; notes that Spanish was once commonly spoken in the Pacific on the colonial-era Philippines, further stating, &quot;at the present time, the Spanish language is not widely used in the South Pacific, being unknown outside of a handful of places. Spanish is spoken by a resident population only on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands, the Chilean possessions of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Juan Fernández Islands and a few other tiny islands. Most Pacific insular possessions of Latin American nations are either unpopulated or used as military outposts, staffed by natives of the mainland.&quot;

Lord Howe Island, located between Australia and New Zealand, is one of the only other habitable oceanic islands to have had no contact with humans prior to European discovery.
The island is currently administered by Australia, and Its residents are primarily European Australians who originated from the mainland, with a small number also being Asian Australians. Like with the Spanish-speaking islanders in the southeastern Pacific, they would not normally be considered Pacific Islanders under an ethnically based definition. Remote and uninhabitable islands in the central Pacific such as Baker Island were also generally isolated from humans prior to European discovery. However, Pacific Islanders are believed to have possibly visited some of these locations, including Wake Island. In the case of Howland Island, there may have even been a brief attempt at settlement.

The Official Journal of the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS) considers the term Pacific Islands to encompass American Samoa, Cook Islands, Easter Island, the Galápagos Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Salas y Gómez Island, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, the United States Minor Outlying Islands, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna. The 1982 edition of the &quot;South Pacific Handbook&quot;, by David Stanley, groups Australia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island and the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia under the more restrictive label of the &quot;South Pacific Islands&quot;, even though Hawaii and most islands in Micronesia technically lie in the North Pacific. He additionally includes the Galápagos Islands in his definition of the South Pacific, but does not include any other islands located within the southeastern Pacific area, aside from Easter Island which is considered part of Polynesia.


Ian Todd&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Island Realm: A Pacific Panorama&quot; considers Oceania and the term &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; to also encompass the non-tropical Aleutian Islands, as well as Clipperton Island, the Coral Sea Islands, the Desventuradas Islands, Guadalupe Island, the Juan Fernández Islands, the Revillagigedo Islands, Salas y Gómez Island and the Torres Strait Islands. He notes that the terms are sometimes taken to include Australia, New Zealand and the non-oceanic Papua New Guinea, however he does not consider them to encompass the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Russia&#x27;s Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island or countries associated with Maritime Southeast Asia. The Philippines according to him are at a &quot;cross-roads of the Pacific—a racial and geographic link connecting Oceania, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.&quot; Debate exists over whether or not the Philippines should be categorized with Pacific Islands of shared Austronesian origin or with the mainland nations of Asia. The islands of the Philippines do not have oceanic geology, and instead sit on the continental shelf of Asia. As such, they are sometimes deemed as a geological extension of Asia. In his 2012 book &quot;Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education&quot;, American author James A. Banks claimed that, &quot;although islands such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan and the Aleutian Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, islanders from these locales are not typically considered Pacific Islanders. They are usually considered Asian, with Aleuts considered Alaskan natives.&quot; Thus, because proximity does not determine ethnicity, only through defined connections such as Maori(Polynesian) and Rapa Nui natives(Polynesian) it has to be evident that &quot;islands&quot; although nearby to Oceana, the inhabitants though distantly connected by similarities in language and practices similar to Melanesians, Micronesians and Polynesians are to be considered Southeast Asian, such as the Philippines.

The Pacific Islands Forum is the major governing organization for the Pacific Islands, and has been labelled as the &quot;EU of the Pacific region&quot;. Up until 2021, its member nations and associate members were American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna. Additionally, there have been pushes for Easter Island and Hawaii to join the Pacific Islands Forum, as they are primarily inhabited by Polynesian peoples. Japan and Malay Archipelago countries such as East Timor, Indonesia and the Philippines are dialogue partners of the Pacific Islands Forum, with East Timor having observer status, but none are full members. The nations of the Malay Archipelago have their own regional governing organization called ASEAN, which includes mainland Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam and Thailand. In July 2019, at the inaugural Indonesian Exposition held in Auckland, Indonesia launched its &#x27;Pacific Elevation&#x27; program, which would encompass a new era of elevated engagement with the region, with the country also using the event to lay claim that Indonesia is culturally and ethnically linked to the Pacific islands. The event was attended by dignitaries from Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific island countries.

Australia and New Zealand have been described as both continental landmasses and as Pacific Islands. New Zealand&#x27;s native population, the Māori, are Polynesians, and thus considered Pacific Islanders. Australia&#x27;s Indigenous population are loosely related to Melanesians and the United States Census categorize them under the Pacific Islander American umbrella. In &quot;Island Realm: A Pacific Panorama&quot; (1974), Ian Todd states that, &quot;New Zealand is uniquely gifted in its role as a Polynesian associate. A large section of its own indigenous population consists of Māori—a Polynesian race. Beyond her own sphere of association, New Zealand&#x27;s trading influence is prominent in Tonga, Fiji and other areas of the Pacific with Commonwealth affiliations.&quot; Regarding Australia, he further wrote, &quot;Australia plays a leading economic role in the south-west Pacific area—commonly known as Melanesia. Fiji, the New Hebrides, the Solomons, even French-controlled New Caledonia have a major trade connection with Australia. The thriving little republic of Nauru was administered by Australia before its recent independence. Further afield, in western Polynesia, Australia provides economic and technical aid in Tonga and Western Samoa. Much of Fiji&#x27;s tourist trade comes from &#x27;down under&#x27;. Among the oceanic islands which are part of the Commonwealth of Australia are Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, the Torres Strait Islands, the Willis Group and Coringa Islands.&quot;

==Pacific Islander regions==
The Pacific islands consist of three main traditional regions.

===Melanesia===
Melanesia is the great arc of islands located north and east of Australia and south of the Equator. The name derives the Greek words &quot;melas&quot; (&#x27;black&#x27;) and &quot;nēsos&quot; (&#x27;island&#x27;) for the predominantly dark-skinned peoples of New Guinea island, the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides), New Caledonia, and Fiji.

In addition those places listed above, Melanesia includes the Louisiade Archipelago, the Admiralty Islands, Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, Western New Guinea (part of Indonesia), Maluku Island, Aru Islands, Kei Islands, the Santa Cruz Islands (part of the Solomon Islands), Loyalty Islands (part of New Caledonia) and various smaller islands. East Timor, while considered to be geographically Southeast Asian, is still generally accepted as being ethnoculturally part of Melanesia. The Torres Strait Islands are politically part of nearby Queensland, Australia, although the inhabitants are considered to be Melanesians rather than Indigenous Australians. This is not the case with other Australian islands that were inhabited by Indigenous peoples prior to European discovery, such as Fraser Island, Great Palm Island and the Tiwi Islands. The Torres Strait Islands could be seen as a Melanesian territory in Australasia, similar to how East Timor is a Melanesian territory in Asia. Norfolk Island was uninhabited when discovered by Europeans, and later became politically integrated into Australia (and by extension, Australasia). The remote island is still sometimes considered to be in Melanesia, as it is close to the region, and has archeological evidence of prehistoric inhabitation.

New Caledonia (and Vanuatu to a lesser extent) were under French colonial influence from the 19th century onward. Most islands however have historically had close ties to Australia and the United Kingdom, with the United States having had little impact on the region.

===Micronesia===
Micronesia includes Kiribati, Nauru, the Marianas (Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae, all in the Caroline Islands).

The islands were under the influence of colonial powers such as Germany, Spain and Japan from the 16th century up until the end of World War II. Several of the island groups have since developed financially crucial political alignments with the United States. Nauru&#x27;s main political partner since World War I has been Australia, excluding a brief period of Japanese occupation in World War II.

===Polynesia===
The Polynesian islands are scattered across a triangle covering the east-central region of the Pacific Ocean. The triangle is bound by the Hawaiian Islands in the north, New Zealand in the west, and Easter Island in the east. The rest of Polynesia includes the Samoan islands (American Samoa and Samoa [formerly Western Samoa]); Cook Islands; French Polynesia (the Society Islands [Tahiti], Marquesas Islands, Austral Islands, and Tuamotu); Niue Island; Tokelau and Tuvalu; Tonga; Wallis and Futuna; Rotuma Island; Pitcairn Island; Nukuoro; and Kapingamarangi.

The majority of island groups are most closely aligned to New Zealand/Australia, with others being politically aligned to France or the United States. Hawaii is geographically isolated from Polynesia, and is situated in the North Pacific, unlike the rest of Polynesia, which is in the South Pacific. They are still a part of the subregion for ethnocultural reasons. Easter Island is located in a remote part of the Pacific which is thousands of kilometers removed from both Polynesia and the South American continent. It was annexed by Chile in 1888, and Spanish is now commonly spoken in a bilingual manner, with some having race-mixed with Mestizo Chilean settlers. However, the inhabitants consider their island and its culture to be Polynesian, and do not view themselves as South Americans.

==Ethnic groups==

The population of the Pacific Islands is concentrated in Papua New Guinea, New Zealand (which has a majority of people of European descent), Hawaii, Fiji, and Solomon Islands. Most Pacific Islands are densely populated, and habitation tends to be concentrated along the coasts.

Melanesians constitute over three quarters of the total indigenous population of the Pacific Islands; Polynesians account for more than one-sixth; and Micronesians make up about one-twentieth.

===Ethnolinguistics===
Several hundred distinct languages are spoken in the Pacific Islands. In ethnolinguistic terms, the Pacific islanders of Oceania are divided into two different ethnic classifications:
* Austronesian-speaking peoples – Austronesian peoples who speak the Oceanian languages, numbering about 2.3 million in population, who occupy Polynesia, Micronesia, and most of the smaller islands of Melanesia.
* Papuan-speaking peoples – Papuan peoples who speak the Papuan languages (the mutually unrelated, non-Austronesian language families), numbering about 7 million in population, and mostly reside on the island of New Guinea and a few of the smaller islands of Melanesia located off the northeast coast of New Guinea.

===List of Pacific peoples===
* Austronesian-speaking peoples
** Polynesians
*** Western Polynesian region
*** Northeast and South Polynesian region
** Melanesians
** Micronesians
* Papuan-speaking peoples
** Papua New Guinea region
** Papua region
** Indonesian New Guinea/West Papua region (see &quot;List of ethnic groups of West Papua&quot;)

==Terminology by country==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term was used to describe Australian descendants of people from the over-80 islands in the western Pacific who had been brought to Australia to work on the sugar fields of Queensland—these people were called in the 19th century.

The &quot;Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901&quot; was enacted to restrict entry of Pacific Islanders to Australia and to authorise their deportation. In this legislation, Pacific Islanders were defined as:
Despite this, Pacific Islanders were generally held in a much higher regard than Indigenous Australians were during the early 20th century.

In 2008, a &quot;Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme&quot; was announced as a three-year pilot experiment. It provides visas for workers from Kiribati, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea to work in Australia. Aside from Papua New Guinea, the scheme includes one country each from Melanesia (Vanuatu), Polynesia (Tonga), and Micronesia (Kiribati)—countries that already send workers to New Zealand under its seasonal labour scheme.

===New Zealand===


Local usage in New Zealand uses (also called &#x27;, or formerly &#x27;,) to distinguish those who have emigrated from one of these areas in modern times from the New Zealand Māori, who are also Polynesian but are indigenous to New Zealand.

In the 2013 New Zealand census, 7.4% of the New Zealand population identified with one or more Pacific ethnic groups, although 62.3% of these were born in New Zealand. Those with a Samoan background make up the largest proportion, followed by Cook Islands Māori, Tongan, and Niuean. Some smaller island populations such as Niue and Tokelau have the majority of their nationals living in New Zealand.

To celebrate the diverse Pacific island cultures, the Auckland Region hosts several Pacific island festivals. Two of the major ones are Polyfest, which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the region, and Pasifika, a festival that celebrates Pacific island heritage through traditional food, music, dance, and entertainment.

===United States===
By the 1980s, the United States Census Bureau grouped persons of Asian ancestry and created the category &quot;,&quot; which continued in the 1990s census. In 2000, &quot; and &quot; became two separate racial categories.

According to the Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program (PEP), a &quot; is,According to the Office of Management and Budget, &quot; refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

Eight out of 10 Pacific Islanders in the United States are native to the United States. Polynesians make up the largest group, including Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tahitians, and Tongans. Micronesians make up the second largest, including primarily Chamoru from Guam; as well as other Chamoru, Carolinian from the Northern Mariana Islands, Marshallese, Palauans, and various others. Among Melanesians, Fijian Americans are the largest in this group.

There are at least 39 different Pacific Island languages spoken as a second language in the American home.

<text>Auchinleck Talbot Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Auchinleck, East Ayrshire. They currently play in the .

The club is also a member of the Scottish Junior Football Association, and have won the Scottish Junior Cup on a record 14 occasions. They compete in a local derby against near neighbours and biggest rivals Cumnock Juniors.

==History==
Auchinleck Talbot was formed in 1909 and take their name from the 2nd Baron Talbot de Malahide, Richard Wogan Talbot, a landowner who donated the site of their Beechwood Park home.

Beechwood Park opened in 1909 with a charity match between The Old Players and The Merchants. Talbot made their team debut the same year when they defeat the juvenile side Highhouse Rangers 4–0. Weeks later they lost their first competitive game at Cronberry Eglinton in the league. Their first win came in September 1909 when they defeated Patna Doon Athletic in their first Scottish Junior Cup tie.

The early and middle history of the club is characterised by periods of fluctuating fortune, often related to the economic conditions in this coal mining district of rural Ayrshire. Talbot folded in 1916 due to financial problems and the First World War but made a comeback four years later, ushering in a relatively successful period for the club. The Ayrshire Cup was won in 1920 by defeating Irvine Meadow 3–0 at Rugby Park. That same year they set a club goalscoring record in the Scottish Junior Cup, defeating Craigbank 11–0 at home, a scoreline surpassed in 2008 when defeating Nairn St. Ninian, 13–1. The South Ayrshire League was won for the first time in 1921 and the following year, a terrace was raised at Beechwood Park to accommodate larger crowds ahead of a Junior Cup quarter-final tie against the eventual winners, a Jimmy McGrory inspired St Roch&#x27;s. Talbot made their first foray to the semi-finals of this tournament in 1924, losing 1–0 to Baillieston at Love Street. In the 1928–29 season however, the club were forced into abeyance due to financial difficulties.

Restarting the next year, Talbot suffered a lean decade through the 1930s until a second Ayrshire Cup victory arrived in 1939. The club closed down for the duration of World War II but on resuming after hostilities, they enjoyed another successful spell, winning five trophies in 1947–48 including the first of twelve West of Scotland Cups before lifting the Scottish Junior Cup for the first time in 1949. The 3–2 victory over Petershill at Hampden Park was watched by a then record crowd of 68,837 and it remains the third highest attendance at a Junior Cup final. Talbot&#x27;s first defence of the trophy drew a record crowd to Beechwood Park when 10,000 people saw Irvine Meadow knock the holders out in the 3rd round. The ground was expanded for the occasion with thousands of tons of mining spoil added to build up the terracing and the &quot;bing&quot; was a feature of the park for a number of years.

By the end of the 1950s, the club&#x27;s fortunes were again on the wane and the 60s was a down-at-heel decade of little success, with a constant battle being fought against vandalism at the ground. This culminated in the pavilion being burned down in 1972. Around this time, Talbot also suffered their record defeat, a humiliating 11–0 reverse at the hands of arch local rivals Cumnock Juniors. From the depths of despair however, a new resolve emerged. A public meeting on the future of the club infused Talbot with new blood. The clubhouse was rebuilt and onfield performances improved under a new manager, Jimsie Kirkland.

Willie Knox, a former Raith Rovers and Forfar wing half, was appointed as manager in 1977 and an unprecedented era of success for the club began. The Ayrshire League was won in Knox&#x27;s first season and in 1979, Talbot&#x27;s hegemony over the West of Scotland Cup began with the first of nine victories in eleven years. The Scottish Junior Cup proved initially elusive with two successive semi-final losses in 1983 and &#x27;84 before Talbot defeated Pollok 3–2 in the Junior Cup Centenary final of 1986, coming back from 2–0 down after fifteen minutes of the game. The club followed up with Junior Cup final victories against Kilbirnie Ladeside in 1987 (after a replay), and Petershill in 1988, becoming the first and so far, only club to win the tournament three times in a row. Talbot added a further two Junior Cup wins under Knox in 1991 and 1992 and when he stepped down as manager in 1993, the number of trophies accumulated under his 16-year tenure stood at 43.
Talbot made their seventh Junior Cup final appearance in 2002 under the management of Tam McDonald, a player in the 1980s three-in-a-row side, but lost on the big day for the first time to Linlithgow Rose. Tommy Sloan had joined the club from Kilwinning Rangers as a player–coach under McDonald in 2003 and he stepped up to the managers role later that year, assisted firstly by Iain Jardine, then by Allan McLuckie. Sloan has led the club to a further seven Scottish finals, winning five times. His first victory in 2006 against Bathgate Thistle also comprised one half of a Super League and Junior Cup double, a feat to be repeated in 2015. After escaping relegation on the final day in his first season, Sloan has established Talbot as the preeminent force in the West Super League with the club winning four successive league titles from 2012–13 onwards, and five in total.

Off the field, Beechwood Park has also been improved in recent years. A building sub-committee formed in 1989 oversaw the purchase of the Main Stand extension from Hamilton Accies old Douglas Park ground for £30,000 in the 1990s and the 460 seat structure was finally opened around 10 years later. The building committee was subsumed into a larger Beechwood Regeneration Committee in 2013 who continue to upgrade facilities. The club have also been accredited with the Scottish Football Association &quot;Standard&quot; Quality Mark award since 2012.

In the eventually cancelled 2019–20 season, a bizarre incident occurred, where Talbot, who were sitting 3rd place, and 12 points off the leaders, Kilwinning Rangers, were awarded the league title. However the debacle was quickly resolved by clearing up that the league was decided on a Points Per Game ratio, rather than calling it as it stood.

In 2020, Talbot moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League.

On 11 October 2020, the club announced it would not participate in the inaugural West of Scotland League season due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Scottish Junior Cup finals record==
Talbot&#x27;s record in the Scottish Junior Cup is the best of any club by some considerable distance. The 2021–22 final was their 17th appearance at this stage of the competition, ahead of Cambuslang Rangers (11 final appearances) and Petershill (10 appearances). In terms of cup victories, the margin is more marked. Talbot&#x27;s 14 Junior Cup wins is more than double the total of the next best clubs, Cambuslang Rangers, Parkhead and Petershill, who have all won the tournament five times.
==Participation in the Scottish Cup==
Since the 2007–08 season, a Junior club which wins the Scottish Junior Cup or one of the three regional Superleague competitions is eligible to compete in the following season&#x27;s Senior Scottish Cup.

Talbot&#x27;s victory over Clydebank in the 2009 Junior Cup final saw them enter the Senior tournament for the first time in 2009–10. The club was drawn at home to Highland League side Fort William in their first ever tie, winning the match 7–0. Talbot then defeated Huntly after a replay before eventually losing to Stirling Albion in the third round.

In their first three years of qualification, Talbot went out to League opposition although they took Stranraer to a replay in 2013–14. Their greatest run until that point had come two years before, when the club reached the fourth round and faced Scottish Premier League side Hearts at Tynecastle Stadium, losing narrowly 1–0. The club took over 2,000 supporters to Edinburgh for the occasion. Hearts would go on to win the cup.

In 2018–19, the club extended their longest run in front of 3,100 crowd at home with a 1–0 fourth round win over Championship side Ayr United; this victory was their first against full-time opponents.

==Former players==

Talbot have seen a number of players step up to Senior football over the years, although the club was not as prolific a nursery as some Junior sides. Two Auchinleck men who moved from their local club to the professional game are Hugh Robertson and Kris Doolan.

Winger Robertson was signed by Willie Thornton for Dundee from Talbot in 1957 at the age of 17 while working as a miner at Barony Colliery. He was a member of the &quot;Dark Blues&quot; League title winning side in 1961–62 managed by Bob Shankly and their subsequent European campaigns including an 8–1 rout of FC Cologne at Dens Park. Robertson was capped once for Scotland in a November 1961 World Cup qualification play-off against Czechoslovakia, setting up both Scotland goals for Ian St John in a 4–2 defeat. Shankly himself played for Talbot for a season in 1929 before joining his own local club, the famous Glenbuck Cherrypickers.

Kris Doolan was an established player with Kello Rovers when Tommy Sloan signed him for his hometown club aged 20 in 2007. His form at Beechwood earned him recognition at Junior international level for Scotland, winning three caps in the 2008 Junior International Quadrangular Tournament held in the Isle of Man. After a season and a half at Talbot, Doolan signed for Partick Thistle in January 2009 after a successful trial and has gone on to be the club&#x27;s fourth equal highest goal scorer of all time.

<text>Physiognomy () or face reading is the practice of assessing a person&#x27;s character or personality from their outer appearance—especially the face. The term can also refer to the general appearance of a person, object, or terrain without reference to its implied characteristics—as in the physiognomy of an individual plant (see plant life-form) or of a plant community (see vegetation).

Physiognomy as a practice meets the contemporary definition of pseudoscience and is regarded as such by academics because of its unsupported claims; popular belief in the practice of physiognomy is nonetheless still widespread and modern advances in artificial intelligence have sparked renewed interest in the field of study. The practice was well-accepted by ancient Greek philosophers, but fell into disrepute in the 16th century while practised by vagabonds and mountebanks. It revived and was popularised by Johann Kaspar Lavater, before falling from favour in the late 19th century. Physiognomy in the 19th century is particularly noted as a basis for scientific racism. Physiognomy as it is understood today is a subject of renewed scientific interest, especially as it relates to machine learning and facial recognition technology. The main interest for scientists today are the risks, including privacy concerns, of physiognomy in the context of facial recognition algorithms.

Physiognomy is sometimes referred to as anthroposcopy, a term originating in the 19th century.

==Ancient==

Notions of the relationship between an individual&#x27;s outward appearance and inner character date back to antiquity, and occasionally appear in early Greek poetry. Siddhars from ancient India defined as identifying personal characteristics with body features. Chinese physiognomy or Chinese face reading () dates back to at least the Spring and Autumn period.

Early indications of a developed physiognomic theory appear in 5th century BC Athens, with the works of Zopyrus (featured in dialogue by Phaedo of Elis), an expert in the art. By the 4th century BC, the philosopher Aristotle frequently referred to theory and literature concerning the relationship of appearance to character. Aristotle was receptive to such an idea, evidenced by a passage in his &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;:

The first systematic physiognomic treatise is a slim volume, (&quot;Physiognomonics&quot;), ascribed to Aristotle, but probably of his &quot;school&quot;, rather than created by Aristotle himself. The volume is divided into two parts, conjectured as originally two separate works. The first section discusses arguments drawn from nature and describes other races (non-Greek) and concentrates on the concept of human behavior. The second section focuses on animal behavior, dividing the animal kingdom into male and female types. From these are deduced correspondences between human form and character.

After Aristotle, the major extant works in physiognomy are:

*Polemo of Laodicea, (2nd century AD), in Greek
*Adamantius the Sophist, (4th century), in Greek
*An anonymous Latin author, (about 4th century)

Ancient Greek mathematician, astronomer, and scientist Pythagoras—who some believe originated physiognomics—once rejected a prospective follower named Cylon because, to Pythagoras, his appearance indicated bad character.

After inspecting Socrates, a physiognomist announced he was given to intemperance, sensuality, and violent bursts of passion—which was so contrary to Socrates&#x27;s image, his students accused the physiognomist of lying. Socrates put the issue to rest by saying, originally, he was given to all these vices, but had particularly strong self-discipline.

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==

The term &#x27;physiognomy&#x27; was common in Middle English, often written as or , as in the &quot;Tale of Beryn&quot;, a spurious addition to &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;: .

Physiognomy&#x27;s validity was once widely accepted. Michael Scot, a court scholar for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote in the early 13th century concerning the subject. English universities taught physiognomy until Henry VIII of England outlawed &quot;beggars and vagabonds playing &#x27;subtile, crafty and unlawful games such as physnomye or &#x27;palmestrye&#x27;&quot; in 1530 or 1531. Around this time, scholastic leaders settled on the more erudite Greek form &#x27;physiognomy&#x27; and began to discourage the entire concept of &#x27;fisnamy&#x27;.

Leonardo da Vinci dismissed physiognomy in the early 16th century as &quot;false&quot;, a chimera with &quot;no scientific foundation&quot;. Nevertheless, da Vinci believed that facial lines caused by facial expressions could indicate personality traits. For example, he wrote that &quot;those who have deep and noticeable lines between the eyebrows are irascible&quot;.

==Modern==
===Johann Kaspar Lavater===
The principal promoter of physiognomy in modern times was the Swiss pastor Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741–1801) who was briefly a friend of Goethe. Lavater&#x27;s essays on physiognomy were first published in German in 1772 and gained great popularity. These influential essays were translated into French and English, and influenced early criminological theory.

=== Lavater&#x27;s critics===

Lavater received mixed reactions from scientists, with some accepting his research and others criticizing it. His harshest critic was scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who said pathognomy, or discovering the character of a person by observing their behavior, was more effective. English religious writer Hannah More (1745–1833) complained to her contemporary writer Horace Walpole, &quot;In vain do we boast ... that philosophy had broken down all the strongholds of prejudice, ignorance, and superstition; and yet, at this very time ... Lavater&#x27;s physiognomy books sell at fifteen guineas a set.&quot;

===Thomas Browne===
Lavater found confirmation of his ideas from the English physician-philosopher Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682), and the Italian Giambattista Della Porta (1535–1615). Browne in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643) discusses the possibility of the discernment of inner qualities from the outer appearance of the face, and wrote:

Browne reaffirmed his physiognomic beliefs in &quot;Christian Morals&quot; (&quot;circa&quot; 1675):

Browne also introduced the word caricature into the English language, whence much of physiognomical belief attempted to entrench itself by illustrative means, in particular through visual political satire.

Italian scholar Giambattista della Porta&#x27;s works are well represented in the Library of Sir Thomas Browne including &quot;Of Celestial Physiognomy&quot;, in which della Porta argued that it was not the stars but a person&#x27;s temperament that influences their facial appearance and character. In &quot;De humana physiognomia &quot;(1586), della Porta used woodcuts of animals to illustrate human characteristics. Both della Porta and Browne adhered to the &#x27;doctrine of signatures&#x27;—that is, the belief that the physical structures of nature such as a plant&#x27;s roots, stem, and flower, were indicative keys (or &#x27;signatures&#x27;) to their medicinal potentials.

==Period of popularity==
The popularity of physiognomy grew throughout the first quarter of the 18th century and into the 19th century. It was discussed seriously by academics, who believed in its potential.

===Use in fiction and art===
Many European novelists used physiognomy in the descriptions of their characters, notably Balzac, Chaucer and portrait artists, such as Joseph Ducreux. A host of 19th-century English authors were influenced by the idea, notably evident in the detailed physiognomic descriptions of characters in the novels of Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Charlotte Brontë.

In addition to Thomas Browne, other literary authors associated with Norwich who made physiognomical observations in their writings include the romantic novelist Amelia Opie, and the travelogue author George Borrow.

Physiognomy is a central, implicit assumption underlying the plot of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. In 19th-century American literature, physiognomy figures prominently in the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe.

===Phrenology===
Phrenology, a form of physiognomy that measures the bumps on the skull in order to determine mental and personality characteristics, was created around 1800 by German physician Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Spurzheim, and was widely popular in the 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the U.S., physician James W. Redfield published his &quot;Comparative Physiognomy&quot; in 1852, illustrating with 330 engravings the &quot;Resemblances between Men and Animals&quot;. He finds these in appearance and (often metaphorically) character, e.g. Germans to Lions, Negroes to Elephants and Fishes, Chinamen to Hogs, Yankees to Bears, Jews to Goats.

In the late 19th century, phrenology became associated with physiognomy and consequently was discredited and rejected. Nevertheless, the German physiognomist Carl Huter (1861–1912) became popular in Germany with his concept of physiognomy, called &quot;psycho-physiognomy&quot;.

===Criminology===

During the late 19th century, English psychometrician Sir Francis Galton attempted to define physiognomic characteristics of health, disease, beauty, and criminality, via a method of composite photography. Galton&#x27;s process involved the photographic superimposition of two or more faces by multiple exposures. After averaging together photographs of violent criminals, he found that the composite image appeared &quot;more respectable&quot; than any of the faces comprising it; this was likely due to the irregularities of the skin across the constituent images being averaged out in the final blend. With the advent of computer technology during the early 1990s, Galton&#x27;s composite technique has been adopted and greatly improved using computer graphics software.

Physiognomy also became of use in the field of Criminology through efforts made by Italian army doctor and scientist, Cesare Lombroso. Lombroso, during the mid-19th century, championed the notion that &quot;criminality was inherited and that criminals could be identified by physical attributes such as hawk-like noses and bloodshot eyes&quot;. Lombroso took inspiration from Charles Darwin&#x27;s recently released theories of evolution and carried many of the misunderstandings that he had regarding evolution into the propagation of the use of physiognomy in criminology. His logic stemmed from the idea that &quot;criminals were &#x27;throwbacks&#x27; in the phylogenetic tree to early phases of evolution&quot;. It is reasonable to conclude that &quot;according to Lombroso, a regressive characteristic united the genius, the madman and the delinquent; they differed in the intensity of this characteristic and, naturally in the degree of development of the positive qualities&quot;. He believed that one could determine whether one was of savage nature just by their physical characteristics. Based on his findings, &quot;Lombroso proposed that the &quot;born criminal&quot; could be distinguished by physical atavistic &quot;stigmata&quot;, such as:
* Large jaws, forward projection of jaw
* Low sloping forehead
* High cheekbones
* Flattened or upturned nose
* Handle-shaped ears
* Hawk-like noses or fleshy lips
* Hard shifty eyes
* Scanty beard or baldness
* Insensitivity to pain
* Long arms relative to lower limbs

This interest in the relationship between criminology and physiognomy began upon Lombroso&#x27;s first interaction with &quot;a notorious Calabrian thief and arsonist&quot; named Giuseppe Villella. Lombroso was particularly taken by many striking personality characteristics that Villella possessed; agility and cynicism being some of them. Villella&#x27;s alleged crimes are disputed and Lombroso&#x27;s research is seen by many as northern Italian racism toward southern Italians. Upon Villella&#x27;s death, Lombroso &quot;conducted a post-mortem and discovered that his subject had an indentation at the back of his skull, which resembled that found in apes&quot;. He later referred to this anomaly as the &quot;median occipital depression&quot;. Lombroso used the term &quot;atavism&quot; to describe these primitive, ape-like behaviors that he found in many of those whom he deemed prone to criminality. As he continued analyzing the data he gathered from Villella&#x27;s autopsy and compared and contrasted those results with previous cases, he inferred that certain physical characteristics allowed for some individuals to have a greater &quot;propensity to offend and were also savage throwbacks to early man&quot;.

These sorts of examinations yielded far-reaching consequences for various scientific and medical communities at the time, and he wrote, &quot;the &quot;natural genesis&quot; of crime implied that the criminal personality should be regarded as a particular form of psychiatric disease&quot;., which is an idea still seen today in psychiatry&#x27;s diagnostic manual, the DSM-5, in its description of antisocial personality disorder. Furthermore, these ideas promoted the concept that when a crime is committed, it is no longer seen as &quot;free will&quot; but instead a result of one&#x27;s genetic pre-disposition to savagery. Lombroso had numerous case studies to corroborate many of his findings due to the fact that he was the head of an insane asylum at Pesaro. He was easily able to study people from various walks of life and was thus able to further define criminal types. Because his theories primarily focused on anatomy and anthropological information, the idea of degeneracy being a source of atavism was not explored till later on in his criminological theory endeavors. These &quot;new and improved&quot; theories led to the notion &quot;that the born criminal had pathological symptoms in common with the moral imbecile and the epileptic, and this led him to expand his typology to include the insane criminal and the epileptic criminal&quot;. In addition, &quot;the insane criminal type [was said to] include the alcoholic, the mattoid, and the hysterical criminal&quot;.

Lombroso&#x27;s ideologies are now recognized as flawed and regarded as pseudo-science. Many have remarked on the overt sexist and racist overtones of his research, and denounce it for those reasons alone. In spite of many of his theories being discredited, he is still hailed as the father of &quot;scientific criminology&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
In France, the concept was further developed in the 20th century under the name morphopsychology, developed by Louis Corman (1901–1995), a French psychiatrist who argued that the workings of vital forces within the human body resulted in different facial shapes and forms. The term &quot;morphopsychology&quot; is a translation of the French word &quot;morphopsychologie&quot;, which Louis Corman coined in 1937 when he wrote his first book on the subject, &quot;Quinze leçons de morphopsychologie&quot; (Fifteen Lessons of Morphopsychology).

== Present day ==

=== Social media ===
Since around 2023–2024, a resurgent discourse around physiognomy has been noted on social media among both male and female users, particularly with regards to memes, face filters, and anti-feminist and incel communities. Such content has raised concern about the normalization of pseudoscience and the idea that physical characteristics are inherently associated with one&#x27;s actions and social status. Examples include the perception of leftists as being unattractive and women&#x27;s femininity as dependent on their skull shape. An article in &quot;Dazed&quot; argued that these pseudosciences &quot;[play] into the appetite to categorise ourselves&quot;.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been reported to heavily employ physiognomy, such as the ability to predict homosexuality, criminality, and political affiliation from images of faces or other records of outwards appearance. Critics have said that this is a result of the biased databases that AI systems are trained on, and have noted its use and potential weaponization by governments and corporations.

== Scientific investigation ==

Due to its legacy of racism and junk science masquerading as criminology, scientific study or discussion of the relationship between facial features and character has become taboo. It had previously posited many links. For example, there is evidence that character can influence facial appearance. Also, facial characteristics influence first impressions of others, which influences our expectations and behavior, which in turn influences character. Lastly, there are several biological factors that influence both facial appearance and character traits, such pre- and post-natal hormone levels and gene expression.

Recent progress in AI and computer vision has been largely driven by the widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs are effective at recognizing patterns in large unstructured data such as digital images, sound, or text, and analyzing such patterns to make predictions. DNNs offer an opportunity to identify links between characteristics and facial features that might be missed or misinterpreted by the human brain.

The relationship between facial features and character traits such as political or sexual orientation is complex, but involves the fact that facial features can shape social behavior, partially as a result of the self-fulfilling prophecy effect. The self-fulfilling prophesy effect asserts that people perceived to have a certain attribute will be treated accordingly, and over time may engage in behaviors consistent with others&#x27; expectations of them. Conversely, social behavior such as addictions to drugs or alcohol, can shape facial features.

Research in the 1990s indicated that three elements of personality in particular – power, warmth and honesty – can be reliably inferred by looking at facial features.

Some evidence indicated that the pattern of whorls in the scalp had some correlation to male homosexuality, though subsequent research has largely refuted the findings on hair whorl patterns.

A February 2009 article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine reported that physiognomy is undergoing a small revival, with research papers trying to find links between personality traits and facial traits. A study of 90 ice hockey players found a statistically significant correlation between a wider face—a greater than average cheekbone-to-cheekbone distance relative to the distance between brow and upper lip—and the number of penalty minutes a player received for violent acts like slashing, elbowing, checking from behind, and fighting.

This revival has continued in the 2010s with the rise of machine learning for facial recognition. For instance, researchers have claimed that it is possible to predict upper body strength and some personality traits (propensity to aggression) only by looking at the width of the face. Political orientation can also be reliably predicted. In a study that used facial recognition technology by analyzing the faces of over one million individuals, political orientation was predicted correctly 74% of the time; considerably better than chance (50%), human ability (55%) or even personality questionnaires (68%). Other studies have used AI and machine learning techniques to identify facial characteristics that predict honesty, personality, and intelligence.

In 2017, a controversial study claimed that an AI algorithm could detect sexual orientation &#x27;more accurately than humans&#x27; (in 81% of the tested cases for men and 71% for women). The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) accused the study of being &quot;junk science&quot; to the BBC. The researchers, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang, responded that their critics were engaged in &quot;premature judgement&quot;. In early 2018, researchers, among them two specialists of AI working at Google (one of the two on face recognition), issued a reportedly contradicting study based on a survey of 8,000 Americans using Amazon&#x27;s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform. The survey yielded many traits that were used to discriminate between gay and straight respondents with a series of yes/no questions. These traits had actually less to do with morphology than with grooming, presentation, and lifestyle (makeup, facial hair, glasses, angle of pictures taken of self, etc.). For more information of this sexual orientation issue in general, see gaydar.

In 2020, a study on the use of consumer facial images for marketing research purposes concluded that deep learning on facial images can extract a variety of personal information relevant to marketers and so users&#x27; facial images could become a basis for ad targeting on Tinder and Facebook. According to the study, while most of facial images&#x27; predictive power is attributable to basic demographics (age, gender, race) extracted from the face, image artifacts, observable facial characteristics, and other image features extracted by deep learning all contribute to prediction quality beyond demographics.

<text>Benburb Football Club is a Scottish football club, based in Govan, Glasgow. Formed in 1885, the club is a member of the Scottish Junior Football Association and currently competes in the West of Scotland Football League. Benburb&#x27;s colours are blue and white.

The team have been managed since February 2024 by Marty Campbell. Campbell took over from former Airdrie defender Paul Lovering (who had in turn succeeded his father Frank who had been in the job for the previous thirteen seasons.) 

== History ==
The origins of the club name are not fully documented, although it has been suggested that the club&#x27;s name indicates roots in what is now Northern Ireland, with a village of the same name being located there, and a significant battle taking place there during the 1640s. The suggestion is that the club was formed by Northern Irish immigrants to Glasgow, but this is not clear. It appears the first team known as Benburb was formed in the Govanhill area of Glasgow (then a separate burgh) in about 1885. After an aborted merger with a Gorbals team, Crown Athletic, in 1895, a reformed Benburb FC played in the nearby Oatlands neighbourhood until June 1898, when its ground, Braehead Park, was taken over by Glasgow Corporation to be incorporated into the new Richmond Park. That team disbanded, but a &#x27;new&#x27; Benburb FC played during the new season later that year and there is thought to be a strong connection between the two clubs.

The new Benburb FC eventually found its home in the Govan area, some miles to the north-west of Oatlands. Initially taking over Govandale Park (situated between the south bank of the River Clyde and Govan Old Parish Church) from the defunct Linthouse club in 1900, they moved south as the demands of industry for the land in central Govan increased, first in 1911 to a park on Broomloan Road owned by Govan Police Force, then in 1925 to an open plot at Craigton Park, Drumoyne, immediately north of the Inverclyde Line railway tracks. In spite of the upheaval, they remained members of the various Junior leagues covering the Glasgow area continuously since 1905.

From 1932 until 29 March 2014, Benburb was based at the purpose-built Tinto Park, which in its heyday could hold 10,000 spectators but latterly fell badly into disrepair. After the final match on that day – a 2–1 victory against Johnstone Burgh in a Central League Division 1 game – the land was prepared for housebuilding. The 2014–15 season was spent ground-sharing with Neilston Juniors while a new ground was built adjacent to the old one (on the same land which was previously Craigton Park). New Tinto Park, now just north of both the railway and the M8 motorway and fitted with 3G artificial turf, became the new home for the club in summer 2015 (although the facilities were not fully completed until a few months later).

New Tinto Park has also been used as the home ground for Rangers W.F.C. from 2015 to 2019, and for Rossvale (originally from Bishopbriggs) since 2019. Harmony Row Juniors now ground share at New Tinto Park

<text>Cumnock Juniors Football Club are a Scottish football club based in Cumnock, Ayrshire.

&quot;The Nock&quot; play their home games at Townhead Park and compete in the West of Scotland Football League.

==History==
Birthed in 1912, they have a history of local and national success. Their nearest neighbours and rivals are Auchinleck Talbot. Both have shared many a hard-fought battle on the field.
These matches are often looked upon as Junior football&#x27;s equivalent to the &quot;Old Firm&quot; with passionate supporters from both sides. This rivalry has become less competitive over the years due to how much better Talbot are, this was proven in their most recent match-up being a 4–0 win for Talbot at Beechwood Park although Cumnock won the most important meeting of that season by beating Talbot on the way to winning the Scottish Junior cup in 2023.

In the 1970s and 1980s this game would often attract a crowd of around 6000; although it has dwindled a bit over the years, the respect and rivalry is still noticeable. A Scottish Junior Cup tie between the two sides in the mid-1970s attracted well over 8000 spectators. Cumnock won 2–1.

A &quot;senior&quot; team based in Cumnock also competed in the 19th century and participated in the early years of the Scottish Cup. Cumnock Juniors play in black and white. Their change strip is white and blue.

From December 2018 until late 2019, the team was managed by local boy and former Queen of the South midfielder, Paul Burns.

Tony McInally has been the manager of the club since November 2019.

In 2020, Cumnock moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League.

On 10 October 2020, the club announced they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two main factors cited were the health and wellbeing of players under the guidelines and fans not being able to attend games.

<text>The quintal or centner is a historical unit of mass in many countries which is usually defined as 100 base units, such as pounds or kilograms. It is a traditional unit of weight in France, Portugal, and Spain and their former colonies. It is commonly used for grain prices in wholesale markets in Ethiopia, Eritrea and India, where 1 quintal = .

In British English, it referred to the hundredweight; in American English, it formerly referred to an uncommon measurement of . 
Languages drawing its cognate name for the weight from Romance languages include French, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish , Italian , Esperanto , Polish . Languages taking their cognates from Germanicized &quot;centner&quot; include the German , Lithuanian , Swedish , Polish , Russian and Ukrainian () and Estonian .

Many European languages have come to translate both the British hundredweight (8 stone or ) and the American hundredweight (), as their cognate form of &quot;quintal&quot; or &quot;centner&quot;.

== Name ==
The concept has resulted in two different series of masses: Those based on the local pound (which after metrication was considered equivalent to , and those uprated to being based on the kilogram.

In Albania (), Ethiopia (), and India, the definition may have been introduced via Islamic trade. It is a standard measurement of mass for agricultural products in those countries.

In France it used to be defined as 100 (pounds), about , and has been redefined as 100 kg (), thus called &quot;metric quintal&quot; with symbol &quot;qq&quot;. In Spain, the is still defined as 100 , or about , but the &quot;metric quintal&quot; is also defined as 100 kg; In Portugal a quintal is 128 or about .

The German and the Danish are pound-based, and thus since metrication are defined as , whereas the Austrian and Swiss since metrication has been re-defined as 100 kg. In Germany a measure of 100 kg is named a .

In Italy, the is commonly used to refer to 100 kg and is abbreviated to &quot;q&quot;, but the usage is considered informal and is not considered legally valid since 1990.

Common agricultural units used in the Soviet Union were the 100 kg () and the term &quot; per hectare&quot;. These are still used by countries that were part of the Soviet Union.

==English use==

In English both terms &quot;quintal&quot; and &quot;centner&quot; were once alternative names for the hundredweight and thus defined either as 100 lb (exactly ) or as . Also, in the Dominican Republic it is about . The German was introduced to the English language via Hanseatic trade as a measure of the weight of certain crops including hops for beer production. Commonly used in the Dominion (and later province) of Newfoundland up until the 1960s as a measure for of salt cod.

The quintal was defined in the United States in 1866 as . However, it is no longer used in the United States or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), though it still appears in the statute.

In France, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Indonesia, and India, it is still in daily use by farmers. It is also used in Brazil and other South American countries and in some African countries including Angola.

<text>Glenafton Athletic Football Club is a Scottish football club, based in New Cumnock, Ayrshire. Members of the Scottish Junior Football Association, they play in the West of Scotland Football League. The club has won the Scottish Junior Cup twice, in 1993 and 2017.

==History==
Glenafton Athletic were founded in 1930, as the coal mining industry which sustained the local area took an upturn after a period of severe depression. The colliery owned Connel Park ground had long been used by the village&#x27;s former teams, including senior side Lanemark from 1877 until World War I, then by a previous Junior side, New Cumnock United, who burst brightly on to the scene in 1920 but failed to see out the decade. Glenafton got off to a flying start themselves, winning the South Ayrshire Junior League in their first season and retaining it the following year. By 1932, the South Ayrshire League had dwindled to six clubs, five of whom were admitted to the more North Ayrshire-centred, Western League in 1933. Glens&#x27; momentum saw them win a Western League and League Cup double in 1934–35, then lift the Ayrshire Cup in 1936. The club closed down for the duration of World War II.

On resuming, the club did not immediately reach their pre-war heights but towards the end of the 1950s things were improving and Glens&#x27; second Western League championship was won in 1958–59. Interest in the club was at an all-time high and a record crowd of 8,000 crammed into Connel Park to see Glens&#x27; Scottish Junior Cup fifth round tie against Kilsyth Rangers in January 1957. The confines of the old ground, surrounded by old miners rows one mile from the village, led the committee to seek an alternative ground and the 1959–60 season would be the last at Connel Park. The club&#x27;s new Loch Park ground in the centre of New Cumnock was formally opened in August 1960 with a league game against Cumnock Juniors. The match was ceremonially kicked off by then Motherwell and Scotland star Ian St John, who had been a Junior player himself only three years previously. The club also ushered in this new era with a change in kit colour, from black and white hoops to white with red.

Glenafton won three Western League championships in a row from 1961–62 to 1963–64, a feat never achieved outwith wartime and drew closer to the biggest prize in the game with their first Scottish Junior Cup semi-final appearance in 1962, losing 1–0 to Kirkintilloch Rob Roy at Rugby Park. The club went one better the following season. After thrashing Cumnock 5–0 in the quarter-final at Loch Park, then seeing off Bonnyrigg Rose in a second semi-final replay, Glens&#x27; lined up against Irvine Meadow at Hampden Park in the first ever all-Ayrshire final. Despite going in front, then missing a penalty at 1–1, Athletic lost the game 2–1 in front of 21,384 spectators. The club entered a period of decline in the late 1960s and early 70s. A Scottish Junior Cup run to the semi-finals in 1978–79 was ended by Cumnock at Rugby Park, but paved the way for improved fortunes. Glens&#x27; enjoyed some local cup success and won the Ayrshire League title in 1982–83.

Former Partick Thistle and Scotland goalkeeper Alan Rough was appointed as manager in 1990 and proceeded to lead the club to their most successful period. A signing policy of reinstating ex-senior footballers including a clutch from Thistle such as Dave MacFarlane, Alex O&#x27;Hara, Jamie Doyle and Alex Kennedy, saw the club reach a record five Junior Cup semi-finals in a row. The club went on to the final in three of those years from 1992 to 1994 and finally lifted the trophy for the first time in 1993 with a 1–0 victory over Tayport at Firhill Stadium. Striker Tom Brown stepped up to Kilmarnock the following season and won the Senior Scottish Cup in 1997, while winning goalscorer John Millar later won the Junior Cup as a player with Arthurlie in 1998 and as a manager with Beith Juniors in 2016 Glens&#x27; added the Ayrshire League and Cup that season to complete a memorable treble. Rough moved on in 1995 and Glens&#x27; next trophy would be the Jackie Scarlett Cup in 1999–2000, but their win over Kilwinning Rangers denied &quot;The Buffs&quot; a clean sweep of Junior trophies that season.

The Junior Superleague era dawned and Glens&#x27; were the last Ayrshire League champions before reconstruction in 2001–02 under manager John McStay. With Tommy Bryce installed in charge the following season, Glens&#x27; finished a creditable third in the first combined Super League Premier Division and also won the West of Scotland Cup for the first time in their history. The West Cup was won again in 2005–06 but the club were relegated after a play-off with Lanark United in 2008–09. Having lost a promotion play-off the previous season, Glens&#x27; won the Super League First Division title in 2012–13 under Darren Henderson. Henderson left for Hurlford United on the eve of the 2013–14 season leaving Tommy Bryce, who returned to the club for a second spell, to rebuild the squad. Bryce&#x27;s remodelled side secured a top six finish and made it all the way to the Scottish Junior Cup final for a fifth time where they ironically lost out to Henderson&#x27;s Hurlford team.

Former Raith Rovers and Ayr United player Craig McEwan took charge of the team in January 2015. A player in Glens&#x27; losing 2014 Junior Cup final side, McEwan led the club to their first Super League Premier Division championship in 2016–17, before completing the double by defeating local rivals Auchinleck Talbot to win the Scottish Junior Cup for a second time in June 2017.

In 2020, Glens&#x27; moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League.

On 11 October 2020, McEwan resigned as manager. The club had released a statement earlier announcing they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Scottish Junior Cup finals record==

Glenafton have a poor record in Scottish Junior Cup finals with two victories from their six appearances to date. The club appeared in the first all Ayrshire final in 1963 and each subsequent loss has also been to an Ayrshire opponent. Glenafton finally ended this run in 2017 with victory over near neighbours Auchinleck Talbot.

<text>Irvine Meadow XI Football Club is a Scottish football club, based in Irvine, North Ayrshire. They currently compete in the . The club&#x27;s home ground is Meadow Park in central Irvine, and they play in royal blue strips.

== History ==
Formed in 1897, they are one of the most successful Junior clubs still playing. Of the two clubs in Irvine, the other being Irvine Victoria, they are the larger. Meadow have set many attendance records at other Junior clubs&#x27; grounds and were at one stage invited to turn senior and play in the Scottish Football League. They decided to remain in the &#x27;juniors&#x27; and at present compete in the Western Region Junior League. 

Irvine Meadow&#x27;s closest rivals are Kilwinning Rangers, based in the neighbouring town of Kilwinning, and Irvine Victoria who play on the other side of the River Irvine at Victoria Park. An annual derby fixture is played each August to coincide with Irvine&#x27;s Marymass Festival. After recent dominance in the fixture over the past decade, Meadow lost 3–1 at Victoria Park in 2017, the first time in 11 years that they had not won the match.

In recent times, Irvine Meadow have another rivalry with Auchinleck Talbot, with the two often contending against each other for the regional title and cups. Talbot are sometimes regarded as Meadow&#x27;s largest rivals, despite the distance between the two clubs within Ayrshire.

In 1933, the club played two minor cup finals and the replay of one of those over two days due to fixture congestion at the end of the season, winning both (they also won the regional league and another cup that year). Meadow were the first junior club in Scotland to have a home game televised when the 1958 Scottish Junior Cup tie against Fauldhouse United was shown on Scotsport. They are the only junior football club to have travelled by air to a game when they went to St. Andrew&#x27;s stadium to play Birmingham City in a match in which they lost 4–3. 

Between 2006 and 2012, Meadow bought players from senior teams such as Brian McGinty and Mark Crilly and did well in the Scottish Junior Cup, as well as winning promotion from the Ayrshire League in 2005–06 and from Super League Division One in 2006–07. They have had a successful period in the subsequent years with Stagecoach West Premier Super League titles in 2008–09, 2010–11 and 2011–12 as well as Evening Times and West of Scotland Cup wins.

On 28 November 2009, Meadow became the first junior club to defeat Scottish Football League opposition in a competitive fixture when they beat Arbroath 1–0 in the third round of the 2009–10 Scottish Cup in front of a crowd of over 1,100. The club were then drawn away to SPL side Hibernian in the fourth round. The game, which took place on 9 January 2010, was arguably the biggest game in the club&#x27;s history. Irvine lost 3–0, but the club stood to make in the region of £55,000 from this fixture, and an estimated 2,000 Meadow fans made the journey to Edinburgh.

In the 2011–12 season, Meadow reached the third round of the Scottish Cup, where they hosted First Division side Livingston at Meadow Park. The tie took place on 19 November 2011. Meadow were well beaten 6–0.

Former players Gareth Turner and Michael Wardrope were appointed as the new management team in May 2016 to replace the departing Davie Greig, and the pair took charge for the start of the 2016–17 season. On 25 October 2017, the new management of Brian McGinty and Stevie Aitchison took over. In June 2018, Irvine Meadow gained promotion via the play-offs to the West Region Premiership for the 2018–19 season.

Brian McGinty resigned as manager on 28 January 2020.

In September 2023, former Irvine Meadow player Martin Ferry was appointed to the role of manager. Ferry will be assisted in his managerial duties by his long standing colleague Des Roache. Des, himself a former Scottish Commonwealth runner and referee. The new management team have indicated they are excited about the task ahead and look forward to introducing a &#x27;Winning Mentality&#x27; to Medda Park in the season ahead. 

The club moved to the senior West of Scotland Football League along with all other West Region Junior teams in 2020. Floodlights were installed at Meadow Park in February 2021 to meet SFA licensing criteria.

<text>Johnstone Burgh Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, and play in .

==History==
The club was formed in 1956, in response to an article in the &quot;Johnstone &amp; Linwood Gazette&quot; newspaper from a journalist that had been ordered out of the newspaper&#x27;s office on the corner of Johnstone&#x27;s Rankine Street by the office manager with instructions not to return until he had a story. The journalist proceeded to ask locals what they thought about forming a new football club to replace the former Scottish league side Johnstone F.C.

Their most successful period was in the late 1950s and 1960s when they twice won junior football&#x27;s top prize – the Scottish Junior Cup. Probably their most successful manager was Jimmy Blackburn who led them to both their Scottish Cup wins as well as West of Scotland Cup and Central League Championship wins. One of our local lads, Bobby Dick, who hails from Elderslie, played what was then right half for the Burgh, and can boast two Scottish Cup winner&#x27;s medals as well as a number of other medals. In those days the cup final was played at Hampden Park, which made it a day to remember. In later years, Bobby&#x27;s nephew Alan Donohoe played in goal for the Burgh and was involved in their cup final of 2000.

The 1967–68 season was Johnstone Burgh&#x27;s most successful season: they won the Scottish Junior Cup, beating Glenrothes 2–1 in extra time after a 2–2 draw at Hampden in the first match. Hugh Gilshan scored the winner. The team also won the Central League Championship and the Evening Times Trophy that season.

Johnstone Burgh has a home support of around 100–150, though this tends to increase vastly when the team is doing well. An OVD Cup tie between Johnstone Burgh and Glenafton Athletic in February 2000 attracted a crowd of over 2000. 

In the 2000 Scottish Junior Cup Final against Whitburn, goals by Colin Lindsay, who later had a spell as manager, and John McLay took the game to penalties after a 2–2 draw. Johnstone Burgh won on penalties in their semi-final at Love Street, but failed to repeat this success in the final.

==Ground==

Since their foundation, &quot;The Burgh,&quot; has been based at James Y. Keanie Park (named after the builder who donated the land the club was built upon). According to &quot;The Juniors, 100 Years A Centenary History of Scottish Football&quot; (McGlone/ McLure) the record attendance was 13,000 v Greenock in the 1963/64 Scottish Junior Cup. 

In 2014 Renfrew Juniors shared Keanie Park Stadium with Johnstone Burgh until October 2014 as a new stadium for Renfrew was not completed for the start of the 2014–15 season.

<doc id="247359" wikidata="Q6406554" url="?curid=247359" title="Kilbirnie Ladeside F.C.">
<text>Kilbirnie Ladeside Football Club are a Scottish football club, from Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire. Based at Valefield Park, they currently play in the West of Scotland Football League. Their main rivals are Beith Juniors. The club nickname, &quot;The Blasties&quot;, derives from a Robert Burns poem, &quot;The Inventory&quot;, written in 1786. However, a more likely reason for the nickname is the proximity of the club to the nearby blast furnaces of the former Glengarnock Steelworks.

==History==
Kilbirnie won their first Scottish Junior Cup title in 1952 with a 1–0 victory over Camelon Juniors at Hampden Park, with over 69,000 fans in attendance. The team&#x27;s Goalkeeper on the day was Tom McQueen, father of future Scotland international Gordon McQueen.

In 2020, Kilbirnie moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League.

On 10 October 2020, the club announced they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, citing the inability of fans to be able to attend games as a huge issue for the club.

==Valefield Park==
Valefield Park is home to Kilbirnie Ladeside. The average attendance is around two hundred (varying for cup games).

===History===
The Blasties&#x27; (the nickname of Kilbirnie Ladeside) original home of Ladeside Park on Mill Road was partly built on by the army during World War II and the club relocated to Valefield, the home of Glengarnock Vale, another local side. Vale did not re-appear after the war and Valefield Park became Ladeside&#x27;s permanent ground. The name &#x27;Ladeside&#x27; derives from the lade that runs near the ground from the old Nether Mill at Knoxsville Road near the Miller&#x27;s Knowe.

===Structure===
Although the ground is small it can comfortably hold up to six hundred spectators. On the north-west side there are two main stands which were both constructed at the start of the new millennium. The ground has around four main turnstiles, two of which are located on Kirkland Road.

<text>Kilwinning Rangers Football Club are a Scottish football club based in the town of Kilwinning, Ayrshire. Formed in 1899, the club competes in the West of Scotland Football League, and are eligible to participate in the Scottish Cup. Nicknamed &quot;The Buffs&quot;, they play in blue and white hoops. Home matches are played at Buffs Park, within Kilwinning Sports Club, where the club moved prior to the 2019–20 season having spent 90 years at Abbey Park.

== History ==
Kilwinning Rangers were originally formed as a Juvenile football club in 1899, sharing Blacklands Park with the local senior club - the now defunct Kilwinning Eglinton (the current Eglinton F.C. are unrelated). In 1902, the club joined the Junior grade however it was three years before the club won their first honour, emerging as winners of the Ayrshire Junior Challenge Cup in 1904–05.

They became the first Ayrshire club to win the Scottish Junior Cup in 1908–09 with a 1–0 victory over Strathclyde. A second appearance in the final followed in 1909–10, however Kilwinning were defeated 3–0 by Ashfield. Ninety years later, Kilwinning regained the Scottish Junior Cup with a 1–0 victory over Kelty Hearts, in a season which saw them win six out of the seven trophies available to them.

Kilwinning became the first Ayrshire side to win the West Super League in 2003–04 however financial issues resulted in the team finishing bottom of the league the following season and subsequently relegated. Most of the following decade was spent in the Ayrshire District League with a promotion to the Super First Division achieved in 2012–13. The following season almost resulted in Kilwinning avoiding relegation, however the club had fielded an ineligible player for twelve matches and the resulting nineteen point deduction relegated the side to the bottom division.

A change in management occurred in February 2014, with the appointment of Chris Strain and Colin Stewart; although Stewart left to take up a coaching role at Rangers in 2015 and Strain assumed the role of sole manager.

Kilwinning achieved successive promotions in 2014-15 and 2016–17, courtesy of a play-off victory against Shettleston and maintained their top flight status the following season by defeating Kilsyth Rangers in another play-off.

In 2020, Kilwinning applied to join the newly formed West of Scotland Football League, which would see them leave the Junior leagues after joining 118 years prior The following year, Kilwinning began their application to join the Scottish Football Association. This application was successful in June 2022, allowing the Buffs to participate in the Scottish Cup for the first time in the history in the 2022–23 season.

In early April 2022, Chris Strain was sacked. Former player and ex-professional, Mark Campbell was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season. Broomhill manager David Gormley was hired for the start of the next season. In January 2023 Gormley was relieved of his position as manager and former Clyde, Ayr United, Morton and Stirling Albion player Chris Aitken was appointed as manager in early February. Following Aitken&#x27;s resignation, Ex-Caledonian Locomotives boss Kevin Kelly was appointed along with his assistant Steven Saunders.

===Scottish Cup===
Kilwinning Rangers made their first ever foray into the Scottish Cup in the 2022–23 season; defeating Rutherglen Glencairn and Tranent, before succumbing to Scottish League Two side Forfar Athletic in the second round proper.

== Nickname ==
Several theories exists as to the origin of the nickname &quot;Buffs&quot;. Historic maps of Kilwinning show the site of the present day Abbey Park to have been within an area known as &quot;The Butts,&quot; an adaption of which may have led to the synonym.

Another theory is that one of the players around that time was a member of the East Kent Regiment of the British Army, who were nicknamed The Buffs.

The early Kilwinning Rangers were known to have played in a dull yellow or &quot;buff&quot; strip. However the origin of the nickname remains unknown.

In January 2025, to coincide with the opening of the new club museum, the origin of the nickname will be revealed as officially endorsed by the club.

== Ground ==
Several grounds were used by the club in the early years of its existence. Initially Kilwinning moved to a ground named Woodwynd Park which was located on Woodwynd itself, between Hamilton Street and Kilrig Avenue. Several years later the club began playing at Claremont Park, near to the now demolished Kilwinning East railway station. The Buffs moved to Abbey Park (near Kilwinning Abbey) in 1929 and remained there until 2019.

At the start of the 2019–20 season they relocated to the Kilwinning Sports Club ground in Pennyburn on the outskirts of the town which was upgraded and renamed Buffs Park.

In April 2020, the club agreed to buy the former Old Trafford floodlights from non-league York City to upgrade Buffs Park to SPFL standards, however, the plan fell through.

A seated stand was added ahead of the 2020-21 West of Scotland Football League season; with the new floodlights following the next year.

<text>Serinus is a genus of small birds in the finch family Fringillidae found in West Asia, Europe and Africa. The birds usually have some yellow in their plumage. The genus was introduced in 1816 by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch. Its name is Neo-Latin for &quot;canary-yellow&quot;.

Many species were at one time assigned to the genus but it became clear from phylogenetic studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that the genus was polyphyletic. This was confirmed by Dario Zuccon and coworkers in a comprehensive study of the finch family published in 2012. The authors suggested splitting the genus into two monophyletic groups, a proposal that was accepted by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The genus &quot;Serinus&quot; was restricted to the European serin and seven other species while a larger clade from Africa and Arabia was assigned to the resurrected genus &quot;Crithagra&quot;.

The genus contains eight species:

<text>The Bible Belt is a region of the Southern United States and the Midwestern state of Missouri (which also has significant Southern influence), where evangelical Protestantism exerts a strong social and cultural influence. The region has been described as one of the most socially conservative across the United States due to a significant impact of Protestant Christianity on politics and culture. The region is known to have a higher church attendance, more evangelical Protestant denominations, and greater emphasis on traditional religious values compared to other parts of the country. The region contrasts with the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes and the Mormon corridor in Utah, southern Idaho, and northern Arizona.

Whereas the states with the highest percentage of residents identifying as non-religious are in the West and New England regions of the United States (with Vermont at 37%, ranking the highest), in the Bible Belt state of Alabama it is just 12%, while Tennessee has the highest proportion of evangelical Protestants, at 52%. The evangelical influence is strongest in Alabama, Georgia, North Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, southern Missouri, Western North Carolina, the Upstate region of South Carolina, Oklahoma, northern and eastern Texas, southern and western Virginia, and West Virginia.

The earliest known usage of the term &quot;Bible Belt&quot; was by American journalist and social commentator H. L. Mencken, who in 1924 wrote in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot;: &quot;The old game, I suspect, is beginning to play out in the Bible Belt.&quot; In 1927, Mencken claimed the term as his invention. The term is now also used in other countries for regions with higher religious doctrine adoption.

===Geography===
The name &quot;Bible Belt&quot; has been applied historically to the South and parts of the Midwest, but is more commonly identified with the South. It encompasses both the Deep South (South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and most of Louisiana) and the Upland South (North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, and Oklahoma). In a 1961 study, Wilbur Zelinsky delineated the region as the area in which Protestant denominations, especially Southern Baptist, Methodist, and evangelical, are the predominant religious affiliations. 

The region also includes most of Texas and North Florida, and extends east to include most of Virginia outside of Northern Virginia. In addition, the Bible Belt covers Missouri south of the Missouri River (i.e. the Ozarks), as well as Southern Indiana and Southern Ohio along the Ohio River.

On the other hand, areas in the South which are &quot;not&quot; considered part of the Bible Belt include heavily Catholic Southern Louisiana, religiously diverse Central and South Florida, overwhelmingly Hispanic South Texas and Trans-Pecos, and Northern Virginia in the Washington metropolitan area. A 1978 study by Charles Heatwole identified the Bible Belt as the region dominated by 24 fundamentalist Protestant denominations, corresponding to essentially the same area mapped by Zelinsky.

According to Stephen W. Tweedie, an Associate Professor Emeritus in the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University, the Bible Belt was viewed in terms of numerical concentration of the audience for religious television when he first published his research in 1995. He finds two belts: one more eastern that stretches from North Florida through Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Southside Virginia, and the Carolinas; and another concentrated in Texas (excluding El Paso and South Texas), Arkansas, Louisiana, (excluding New Orleans and Acadiana), Oklahoma, Missouri (excluding Kansas City and St. Louis), and Mississippi. &quot;[H]is research also broke the Bible Belt into two core regions, a western region and an eastern region.&quot; Tweedie&#x27;s western Bible Belt was focused on a core that extended from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Tulsa, Oklahoma. His eastern Bible Belt was focused on a core that included the major population centers of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.

A study by the Pew Research Center in 2016 found that the ten most religious states were Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia, Oklahoma and North Carolina. A 2014 study by the Pew Research Center found that the states with the highest belief in the Bible as the literal word of God were Mississippi (56%), Alabama (51%), South Carolina (49%), West Virginia (47%), Tennessee (46%), Arkansas (45%), Louisiana (44%), Georgia (41%), Kentucky (41%), and Texas (39%).

====Other Bible Belts in the United States====
In addition to the South, there is a smaller Bible Belt in West Michigan, centered on the heavily Dutch-influenced cities of Holland and Grand Rapids. Christian colleges in that region include Calvin University, Hope College, Cornerstone University, Grace Christian University, and Kuyper College. Much like the South, West Michigan is generally fiscally and socially conservative.

There is also a Bible Belt in the western suburbs of Chicago (especially in DuPage County), centered on Wheaton. Christian colleges in that region include Wheaton College, North Central College, Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Elmhurst University. Christian publishing houses in that region include Crossway, InterVarsity Press, and Tyndale House. Carol Stream is home to the headquarters of &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.

Colorado Springs, Colorado could be considered a Bible belt due to the large amount of prominent evangelical organizations headquartered there including Focus on the Family, Compassion International, The Navigators, David C. Cook, Young Life, Biblica, and others, even though it has low church attendance compared to other Bible belts.

===History===
During the colonial period (1607–1776), the South was a stronghold of the Anglican church. Its transition to a stronghold of non-Anglican Protestantism occurred gradually over the next century as a series of religious revival movements, many associated with the Baptist denomination, gained great popularity in the region.

The northern colonial Bible Belt (especially New England with its Puritan heritage) frequently performed missionary work in the South. &quot;The centre of Particular Baptist activity in early America was in the Middle Colonies. In 1707 five churches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware were united to form the Philadelphia Baptist Association, and through the association they embarked upon vigorous missionary activity. By 1760 the Philadelphia association included churches located in the present states of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia; and by 1767 further multiplication of churches had necessitated the formation of two subsidiary associations, the Warren in New England and the Ketochton in Virginia. The Philadelphia association also provided leadership in organizing the Charleston Association in the Carolinas in 1751.&quot;

An influential figure was Shubal Stearns: &quot;Shubael Stearns, a New England Separate Baptist, migrated to Sandy Creek, North Carolina, in 1755 and initiated a revival that quickly penetrated the entire Piedmont region. The churches he organized were brought together in 1758 to form the Sandy Creek Association&quot;. Stearns was brother-in-law of Daniel Marshall, who was born in Windsor, Connecticut and &quot;is generally considered the first great Baptist leader in Georgia. He founded Kiokee Baptist Church, the oldest continuing Baptist congregation in the state&quot;. Also, Wait Palmer, of Toland, Connecticut, may have influenced African American Christianity in the South: &quot;The Silver Bluff, South Carolina, revival was a seminal development, whose role among blacks rivalled that played by the Sandy Creek revival of the Separate Baptists, to which it was indirectly related. It was probably the same Wait Palmer who had baptized Shubal Stearns in 1751 who came to Silver Bluff in 1775, baptizing and constituting a church. Abraham Marshall, who encouraged the later offshoots, was a Separate Baptist of the Sandy Creek school. The revival at the Silver Bluff plantation of George Galphin (some twelve miles from Augusta, Georgia) had brought David George to the Afro-Baptist faith and had provided a ministry for George Liele&quot;.

According to Thomas P. Kidd, &quot;As early as 1758, Sandy Creek missionaries helped organize a slave congregation, the Bluestone Church, on the plantation of William Byrd III, which may have been the first independently functioning African American church in North America. The church did not last long, but it reflected the Baptists&#x27; commitment to evangelizing African Americans&quot;. According to Gayraud S. Wilmore, &quot;The preaching of New England Congregationalists such as Jonathan Edwards about the coming millennium, and his conviction that Christians were called to prepare for it, reached the slaves through the far-ranging missionary work of white evangelists such as Shubal Stearns, Wait Palmer, and Matthew Moore - all of whom left Congregationalism and became Separatist Baptist preachers in the plantation country of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia&quot;.

===&quot;Buckle of the Bible Belt&quot;===

A study was commissioned by the American Bible Society to survey the importance of the Bible in the metropolitan areas of the United States. The report was based on 42,855 interviews conducted between 2005 and 2012. It determined the 10 most &quot;Bible-minded&quot; cities were Knoxville, Tennessee; Shreveport, Louisiana; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Springfield, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Lynchburg, Virginia; Huntsville-Decatur, Alabama; and Charleston, West Virginia.

Several locations are occasionally referred to as &quot;the Buckle of the Bible Belt&quot;:
* Abilene, Texas, a city of 117,000, is home to three Protestant universities: the Baptist affiliated Hardin–Simmons University, the Church of Christ&#x27;s Abilene Christian University, and Methodist founded McMurry University.
* Nashville, Tennessee, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Protestant Vatican&quot;, has over 700 churches, several seminaries, and a number of Christian schools, colleges and universities, including Belmont University, Trevecca Nazarene University, Lipscomb University, Welch College and American Baptist College. Nashville is the seat of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., the headquarters of the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association of Free Will Baptists, the Gideons International, the Gospel Music Association, and Thomas Nelson, the world&#x27;s largest producer of Bibles. 
* Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a city where Protestant and, in particular, Southern Baptist, the Word of Faith movement, and other evangelical Christian traditions are very prominent. Tulsa is home to Oral Roberts University, Phillips Theological Seminary, and RHEMA Bible Training College (in the suburb of Broken Arrow). A number of prominent Protestant Christians have lived or studied in Tulsa, including Joel Osteen, Kenneth E. Hagin, Carlton Pearson, Kenneth Copeland, Billy Joe Daugherty, Smokie Norful, and Billy James Hargis. Tulsa is also home to a number of vibrant Mainline Protestant congregations. Some of these congregations were founded during the oil boom of the early twentieth century and their facilities are noted for striking architecture, such as the art deco Boston Avenue Methodist Church and First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa. The metropolitan area has at least four religious radio stations (KCFO, KNYD, KXOJ, &amp; KPIM), and at least two religious TV stations (KWHB &amp; KGEB).
* Greenville, South Carolina, is a city where many Baptist churches, particularly Independent Baptist, are located. There are more than one hundred Baptist churches in the Greenville area, as well as Bob Jones University. It also is the home of WTBI-FM radio station which plays old-fashioned Christian music and preaching 24 hours a day.

===Political and cultural context===

Evangelical Protestantism in recent decades links to social conservatism. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman told Catholic leaders he wanted to send an ambassador to the Vatican. Truman said the leading Democrats in Congress approved, but they warned him, &quot;it would defeat Democratic Senators and Congressmen in the Bible Belt.&quot;

In presidential elections, the Bible Belt states of Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas have voted for the Republican candidate in all elections since 1980; Oklahoma has supported the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1968, with Republicans having carried every county in the state in all presidential elections since 2004. The states of Kentucky, Louisiana, West Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee have voted for the Republican candidate in all elections since 1996.

However, with the exception of Mississippi, historical geographer Barry Vann shows that counties in the upland areas of the Appalachians and the Ozarks have a more conservative voting pattern than the counties located in the coastal plains.

During Republican presidential primaries, Christian Social Conservatives tend to win most states from the Bible Belt. In the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries Mike Huckabee won most Bible Belt states. In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries Rick Santorum won most states. Both were Christian Social Conservatives. In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries Donald Trump won most of the states while Ted Cruz won few.

==Outside the United States==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term &quot;Bible Belt&quot; has been used to refer to areas within individual cities, which have a high concentration of Christian residents usually centralized around a megachurch, for example:
* Formerly, the northwestern suburbs of Sydney focusing on The Hills District were traditionally known as the &quot;bible belt&quot;, where Hillsong Church is located. Between the 2011 and 2016 census, however, the Christian population of The Hills district reduced by 18.5% and those without a religion grew from 1 in 8 in 2006 to 1 in 5 in the 2016 census.
*The Greater Western Sydney area, typically in the City of Fairfield area, in the suburbs between Fairfield and Horsley Park, where the megachurches are St Hurmizd Church, an Assyrian Church of the East and the Apostle Chaldean Catholic Church, a Chaldean Catholic church. Other bible belts include those with high Anglo-Saxon Protestant populations found in the Sutherland Shire, parts of City of Penrith, Camden Council and the Wollondilly Shire.
* The outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, where CityLife Church, Crossway Baptist Church, Stairway Church and Discovery Church are located.
* The northeastern suburbs of Adelaide focusing on Paradise, Modbury and Golden Grove, where Influencers Church is located
* The Brisbane southern suburbs of Mansfield, Springwood, Carindale and Mount Gravatt.
*In 2017 the far northern suburbs of Perth were forming this reputation, with the focus being on One Church and Globalheart in the suburbs of Merriwa and Joondalup respectively.
*Toowoomba city in Queensland has long been regarded as fertile ground for Christian fundamentalist right-wing movements that adhere to biblical literalism, particularly those within the Pentecostal and charismatic stream of Christianity.

===Canada===
The province of Alberta has been referred to as Canada&#x27;s Bible Belt with a significant Catholic, Anabaptist population, and other Protestants. Certain areas of Canada&#x27;s east coast region, such as the province of New Brunswick, also contain significant populations of Catholic, Baptist, Anglican, and United faith adherents, up to 85% overall. There is also a vast Bible belt across southern Manitoba.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, rural western Jutland in particular is considered to be the Bible Belt. This is due to the higher number of citizens who are associated (in this particular area) with conservative Lutheran Christian organizations such as the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark, which traditionally have had a very strong resistance to abortion and LGBT rights. Today, the movement is strongest around Hedensted, Løsning, Korning, and Øster Snede. The Danish Oasis Movement, the YMCA, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are also active in the area. The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church is active in Løsning and the Adventists in Vejle.

===Estonia===
Census results show religious belief in the country is more prevalent in the east running from north to south along the border with Russia, particularly in those areas with large populations of Russian Orthodox, Estonian Orthodox, and Orthodox Old Believers.

===Finland===
In North Ostrobothnia, Lapland, and Northern Savonia, the influence of the Laestadian movement, a Finnish Lutheran revival, is particularly strong. In South Ostrobothnia and Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia, the influence of awakenism and evangelicalism (&quot;evankelisuus&quot;) is strong, as is that of the Free Church. The Finnish Bible Belt has been described on the basis of various indicators, but there is no precise definition. Mika Gissler of the THL has identified the medical districts of the Ostrobothnian regions as the Bible zone, which have distinguished themselves in the long term by a lower number of abortions than the rest of the country. Perho in Central Ostrobothnia is the most Lutheran municipality in Finland. Church membership in Ostrobothnia is also more common than in the rest of the country. Voting of the Christian Democrats in 2019 parliamental elections was most common in Larsmo and Parkano.

===France===
Brittany has a long Catholic tradition, and the church has historically played an important role in the region&#x27;s cultural and social life. Today, the region is known for its many religious festivals and processions, as well as its numerous churches, chapels, and shrines. Another region with a strong Catholic tradition is the Vendée, which is located in western France. The Vendée has a long history of resistance to anti-clericalism and anti-Catholicism, dating back to the French Revolution.

===Germany===
An area in the Ore Mountains in Saxony has been described as the &quot;Saxon Bible Belt&quot; with a notable evangelical Protestant/Christian fundamentalist/free church community, as well as some conservative Lutheran parishes that are opposed to same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony approved church resolutions regarding the issue regardless of opinions within those parishes.

===Lithuania===
Among its Baltic neighbors, Lithuania is in general much more religious with Catholicism having long historical roots in the culture of Lithuanians, but even in this context Vilnius district and Šalčininkai district municipalities with a large number of Lithuanian Poles, are the most religious administrative regions of Lithuania. Both the Šalčininkai and Vilnius district municipalities by the ruling Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance were declared as guarded and ruled by Jesus Christ.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, there is what is known as the Rosary Belt (Spanish: Cinturón del Rosario). The term, created by journalist and writer Carlos Monsiváis in 1999, refers to a region comprising the states of Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Querétaro and, in more recent years, Zacatecas, where 90% of the population professes Roman Catholicism, which has a notable influence on local politics and society. Guanajuato, for example, is one of the most important electoral strongholds of the National Action Party, of Christian democrat tradition, mostly inspired by the Social Doctrine of the Church, and with strong conservative ideals. It was in this region where the first uprisings against the government took place during the Cristero War, demanding an end to the persecution of Catholics in the country as a result of the promulgation of the so-called Calles Law, which restricted Catholic worship in Mexico.

===Netherlands===
The Bible Belt of the Netherlands (Dutch: &quot;Bijbelgordel&quot;) stretches from Zeeland, through the West-Betuwe and Veluwe, to the northern parts of the province Overijssel. In this region, orthodox Calvinists prevail.

The ABC Islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao are all under 20% irreligious.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, Mount Roskill, Auckland, contains the highest number of churches per capita in the country, and is the home of several Christian political candidates. The electorate was one of the last in the country to go &quot;wet&quot;, in 1999, having formerly been a dry area where the selling of alcohol was prohibited.

In the 2013 New Zealand census, the Māngere-Ōtāhuhu Local Board area of Auckland had the highest concentration of Christians in New Zealand, with 67.7 percent of the local board&#x27;s 71,000 residents identifying as such. This is due to its high proportion of Pacifica immigrants. 

In contrast to other bible belts, both areas tend to vote for left-wing candidates and are both currently represented in parliament by the center-left Labour Party as of 2023.

===Norway===
The Bible Belt of Norway is located mainly in the western and southern parts of the country, especially rural areas of Agder and Rogaland counties, which contains numerous devout Lutherans.

===Poland===
The southern and eastern parts of Poland are much more religious than in the north and west. See Poland A and B.

===Soviet Union===
Before its independence, Soviet Ukraine was known as the Bible Belt of the Soviet Union, with a significant proportion of Baptists.

===Sweden===
The area normally called the Bible Belt of Sweden is centered on Jönköping in southern Sweden and contains numerous free churches. Of the Småland counties, Jönköping is characterized by the Free Church, Kalmar by the High Church, and Kronoberg by the Old Church. In a broader sense, the Bible Belt refers to the area between Jönköping and Gothenburg.

There are also numerous conservative Lutheran Laestadians in the Torne valley area in the far north of the country.

===United Kingdom===
In Northern Ireland, the area in County Antrim stretching from roughly Ballymoney to Larne and centered in the area of Ballymena is often referred to as a Bible Belt. This is because the area is heavily Protestant with a large evangelical community. From 1970 to 2010, the MP for North Antrim was Ian Paisley, a Free Presbyterian minister well known for his theological fundamentalism. The town of Ballymena, the largest town in the constituency, is often referred to as the &quot;buckle&quot; of the Bible Belt.

<text>The genus Carduelis
is a group of birds in the finch family Fringillidae.

The genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s specific epithet for the European goldfinch &quot;Fringilla carduelis&quot;. The name &quot;carduelis&quot; is the Latin word for the European goldfinch.

The polyphyletic nature of the genus was confirmed by Dario Zuccon and coworkers in a comprehensive study of the finch family published in 2012. The authors suggested splitting the genus into several monophyletic clades, a proposal that was accepted by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The siskins and goldfinches from the Americas formed a distinct clade and were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Spinus&quot;, the greenfinches were moved to the genus &quot;Chloris&quot;, the twite and linnets formed another clade and were moved to the genus &quot;Linaria&quot; and finally the redpolls were moved to the genus &quot;Acanthis&quot;.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; is now restricted to three European species:

<text>In computer science, communicating sequential processes (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems. It is a member of the family of mathematical theories of concurrency known as process algebras, or process calculi, based on message passing via channels. CSP was highly influential in the design of the occam programming language and also influenced the design of programming languages such as Limbo, RaftLib, Erlang, Go, Crystal, and Clojure&#x27;s core.async.

CSP was first described by Tony Hoare in a 1978 article, and has since evolved substantially. CSP has been practically applied in industry as a tool for specifying and verifying the concurrent aspects of a variety of different systems, such as the T9000 Transputer, as well as a secure e-commerce system. The theory of CSP itself is also still the subject of active research, including work to increase its range of practical applicability (e.g., increasing the scale of the systems that can be tractably analyzed).

== History ==
=== Original version ===
The version of CSP presented in Hoare&#x27;s original 1978 article was essentially a concurrent programming language rather than a process calculus. It had a substantially different syntax than later versions of CSP, did not possess mathematically defined semantics, and was unable to represent unbounded nondeterminism. Programs in the original CSP were written as a parallel composition of a fixed number of sequential processes communicating with each other strictly through synchronous message-passing. In contrast to later versions of CSP, each process was assigned an explicit name, and the source or destination of a message was defined by specifying the name of the intended sending or receiving process. For example, the process

 COPY = *[c:character; west?c → east!c]

repeatedly receives a character from the process named codice_1 and sends that character to process named codice_2. The parallel composition

 [west::DISASSEMBLE || X::COPY || east::ASSEMBLE]

assigns the names codice_1 to the codice_4 process, codice_5 to the codice_6 process, and codice_2 to the codice_8 process, and executes these three processes concurrently.

=== Development into process algebra ===

Following the publication of the original version of CSP, Hoare, Stephen Brookes, and A. W. Roscoe developed and refined the &quot;theory&quot; of CSP into its modern, process algebraic form. The approach taken in developing CSP into a process algebra was influenced by Robin Milner&#x27;s work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and conversely. The theoretical version of CSP was initially presented in a 1984 article by Brookes, Hoare, and Roscoe, and later in Hoare&#x27;s book &quot;Communicating Sequential Processes&quot;, which was published in 1985. In September 2006, that book was still the third-most cited computer science reference of all time according to Citeseer (albeit an unreliable source due to the nature of its sampling). The theory of CSP has undergone a few minor changes since the publication of Hoare&#x27;s book. Most of these changes were motivated by the advent of automated tools for CSP process analysis and verification. Roscoe&#x27;s &quot;The Theory and Practice of Concurrency&quot; describes this newer version of CSP.

=== Applications ===
An early and important application of CSP was its use for specification and verification of elements of the INMOS T9000 Transputer, a complex superscalar pipelined processor designed to support large-scale multiprocessing. CSP was employed in verifying the correctness of both the processor pipeline and the Virtual Channel Processor, which managed off-chip communications for the processor.

Industrial application of CSP to software design has usually focused on dependable and safety-critical systems. For example, the Bremen Institute for Safe Systems and Daimler-Benz Aerospace modeled a fault-management system and avionics interface (consisting of about 23,000 lines of code) intended for use on the International Space Station in CSP, and analyzed the model to confirm that their design was free of deadlock and livelock. The modeling and analysis process was able to uncover a number of errors that would have been difficult to detect using testing alone. Similarly, Praxis High Integrity Systems applied CSP modeling and analysis during the development of software (approximately 100,000 lines of code) for a secure smart-card certification authority to verify that their design was secure and free of deadlock. Praxis claims that the system has a much lower defect rate than comparable systems.

Since CSP is well-suited to modeling and analyzing systems that incorporate complex message exchanges, it has also been applied to the verification of communications and security protocols. A prominent example of this sort of application is Lowe&#x27;s use of CSP and the FDR refinement-checker to discover a previously unknown attack on the Needham–Schroeder public-key authentication protocol, and then to develop a corrected protocol able to defeat the attack.

== Informal description ==
As its name suggests, CSP allows the description of systems in terms of component processes that operate independently, and interact with each other solely through message-passing communication. However, the &quot;Sequential&quot; part of the CSP name is now something of a misnomer, since modern CSP allows component processes to be defined both as sequential processes, and as the parallel composition of more primitive processes. The relationships between different processes, and the way each process communicates with its environment, are described using various process algebraic operators. Using this algebraic approach, quite complex process descriptions can be easily constructed from a few primitive elements.

=== Primitives ===
CSP provides two classes of primitives in its process algebra: events and primitive processes.

;Events

Events represent communications or interactions. They are assumed to be instantaneous, and their communication is all that an external ‘environment’ can know about processes. An event is communicated only if the environment allows it. If a process does offer an event and the environment allows it, then that event &quot;must&quot; be communicated. Events may be atomic names (e.g. , ), compound names (e.g. , ), or input/output events (e.g. , ). The set of all events is denoted formula_1.

;Primitive processes

Primitive processes represent fundamental behaviors: examples include formula_2 (the process that immediately deadlocks), and formula_3 (the process that immediately terminates successfully).

=== Algebraic operators ===
CSP has a wide range of algebraic operators. The principal ones are informally given as follows.

; Prefix

The prefix operator combines an event and a process to produce a new process. For example, formula_4 is the process that is willing to communicate event formula_5 with its environment and, after formula_5, behaves like the process formula_7.

; Recursion

Processes can be defined using recursion. Where formula_8 is any CSP term involving formula_7, the process formula_10 defines a recursive process given by the equation
formula_11.
Recursions can also be defined mutually, such as
formula_12
which defines a pair of mutually recursive processes that alternate between communcating formula_13 and formula_14.

; Deterministic choice

The deterministic (or external) choice operator allows the future evolution of a process to be defined as a choice between two component processes and allows the environment to resolve the choice by communicating an initial event for one of the processes. For example, formula_15 is the process that is willing to communicate the initial events formula_5 and formula_17 and subsequently behaves as either formula_7 or formula_19, depending on which initial event the environment chooses to communicate.

; Nondeterministic choice

The nondeterministic (or internal) choice operator allows the future evolution of a process to be defined as a choice between two component processes, but does not allow the environment any control over which one of the component processes will be selected. For example, formula_20 can behave like either formula_4 or formula_22. It can refuse to accept formula_5 or formula_17 and is only obliged to communicate if the environment offers both formula_5 and formula_17.

Nondeterminism can be inadvertently introduced into a nominally deterministic choice if the initial events of both sides of the choice are identical. So, for example,
formula_27 and
formula_28
are equivalent.

; Interleaving

The interleaving operator represents completely independent concurrent activity. The process formula_29 behaves as both formula_7 and formula_19 simultaneously. The events from both processes are arbitrarily interleaved in time. Interleaving can introduce nondeterminism even if formula_7 and formula_19 are both deterministic: if formula_7 and formula_19 can both communicate the same event, then formula_29 nondeterministically chooses which of the two processes communicated that event.

; Interface parallel

The interface parallel (or generalized parallel) operator represents concurrent activity that requires synchronization between the component processes: for formula_37, any event in the interface set formula_38 can only occur when both formula_7 and formula_19 are able to engage in that event.

For example, the process formula_41 requires that formula_7 and formula_19 must both be able to perform event formula_5 before that event can occur. So, the process formula_45 is equivalent to formula_46, while formula_47 is equivalent to formula_2 (i.e. the process deadlocks).

; Hiding

The hiding operator provides a way to abstract processes by making some events unobservable by the environment. formula_49 is the process formula_7 with the event set formula_51 hidden.

A trivial example of hiding is formula_52 which, assuming that the event formula_5 doesn&#x27;t appear in formula_7, simply reduces to formula_7. Hidden events are internalized as τ-actions, which are invisible to and uncontrollable by the environment. The existence of hiding introduces an additional behaviour called divergence, where an infinite sequence of τ-actions is performed. This is captured by the process formula_56, whose behaviour is solely to perform τ-actions forever. For example, formula_57 is equivalent to formula_56.

=== Examples ===

One of the archetypal CSP examples is an abstract representation of a chocolate vending machine and its interactions with a person wishing to buy some chocolate. This vending machine might be able to carry out two different events, “coin” and “choc” which represent the insertion of payment and the delivery of a chocolate respectively. A machine which demands payment (only in cash) before offering a chocolate can be written as:

formula_59

A person who might choose to use a coin or card to make payments could be modelled as:

formula_60

These two processes can be put in parallel, so that they can interact with each other. The behaviour of the composite process depends on the events that the two component processes must synchronise on. Thus,

formula_61

whereas if synchronization was only required on “coin”, we would obtain

formula_62

If we abstract this latter composite process by hiding the “coin” and “card” events, i.e.

formula_63

we get the nondeterministic process

formula_64

This is a process which either offers a “choc” event and then stops, or just stops. In other words, if we treat the abstraction as an external view of the system (e.g., someone who does not see the decision reached by the person), nondeterminism has been introduced.

== Formal definition ==
=== Syntax ===
The syntax of CSP defines the “legal” ways in which processes and events may be combined. Let be an event, and be a set of events. Then the basic syntax of CSP can be defined as:

formula_65

Note that, in the interests of brevity, the syntax presented above omits the formula_56 process, which represents divergence, as well as various operators such as alphabetized parallel, piping, and indexed choices.

=== Formal semantics ===
CSP has been imbued with several different formal semantics, which define the &quot;meaning&quot; of syntactically correct CSP expressions. The theory of CSP includes mutually consistent denotational semantics, algebraic semantics, and operational semantics.

==== Denotational semantics ====
The three major denotational models of CSP are the &quot;traces&quot; model, the &quot;stable failures&quot; model, and the &quot;failures/divergences&quot; model. Semantic mappings from process expressions to each of these three models provide the denotational semantics for CSP.

The &quot;traces model&quot; defines the meaning of a process expression as the set of sequences of events (traces) that the process can be observed to perform. For example,

* formula_67 since formula_2 performs no events
* formula_69 since the process formula_70 can be observed to have performed no events, the event , or the sequence of events followed by 

More formally, the meaning of a process in the traces model is defined as formula_71 such that:
# formula_72 (i.e. formula_73 contains the empty sequence)
# formula_74 (i.e. formula_73 is prefix-closed)
where formula_76 is the set of all possible finite sequences of events.

The &quot;stable failures model&quot; extends the traces model with refusal sets, which are sets of events formula_38 that a process can refuse to perform. A &quot;failure&quot; is a pair formula_78, consisting of a trace , and a refusal set which identifies the events that a process may refuse once it has executed the trace . The observed behavior of a process in the stable failures model is described by the pair formula_79. For example,

formula_80
formula_81

The &quot;failures/divergence model&quot; further extends the failures model to handle divergence. The semantics of a process in the failures/divergences model is a pair formula_82 where formula_83 is defined as the set of all traces that can lead to divergent behavior and formula_84.

== Tools ==
Over the years, a number of tools for analyzing and understanding systems described using CSP have been produced. Early tool implementations used a variety of machine-readable syntaxes for CSP, making input files written for different tools incompatible. However, most CSP tools have now standardized on the machine-readable dialect of CSP devised by Bryan Scattergood, sometimes referred to as CSP&quot;M&quot;. The CSP&quot;M&quot; dialect of CSP possesses a formally defined operational semantics, which includes an embedded functional programming language.

=== FDR ===

The most well-known CSP tool is probably &quot;Failures-Divergences Refinement&quot;, which is a commercial product originally developed by Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd. FDR is often described as a model checker, but is technically a &quot;refinement&quot; checker, in that it converts two CSP process expressions into Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs), and then determines whether one of the processes is a refinement of the other within some specified semantic model (traces, failures, or failures/divergence). FDR applies various state-space compression algorithms to the process LTSs in order to reduce the size of the state-space that must be explored during a refinement check. FDR was succeeded by FDR2, FDR3 and FDR4.

=== ARC ===

The &quot;Adelaide Refinement Checker&quot; (&quot;ARC&quot;) is a CSP refinement checker developed by the Formal Modelling and Verification Group at The University of Adelaide. ARC differs from FDR2 in that it internally represents CSP processes as Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which alleviates the state explosion problem of explicit LTS representations without requiring the use of state-space compression algorithms such as those used in FDR2.

=== ProB ===

The &quot;ProB&quot; project, which is hosted by the Institut für Informatik, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, was originally created to support analysis of specifications constructed in the B method. However, it also includes support for analysis of CSP processes both through refinement checking, and LTL model-checking. ProB can also be used to verify properties of combined CSP and B specifications. A ProBE CSP Animator is integrated in FDR3.

=== PAT ===

The &quot;Process Analysis Toolkit&quot; (PAT)
 is a CSP analysis tool developed in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore. PAT is able to perform refinement checking, LTL model-checking, and simulation of CSP and Timed CSP processes. The PAT process language extends CSP with support for mutable shared variables, asynchronous message passing, and a variety of fairness and quantitative time related process constructs such as codice_9 and codice_10. The underlying design principle of the PAT process language is to combine a high-level specification language with procedural programs (e.g. an event in PAT may be a sequential program or even an external C# library call) for greater expressiveness. Mutable shared variables and asynchronous channels provide a convenient syntactic sugar for well-known process modelling patterns used in standard CSP. The PAT syntax is similar, but not identical, to CSP&quot;M&quot;. The principal differences between the PAT syntax and standard CSP&quot;M&quot; are the use of semicolons to terminate process expressions, the inclusion of syntactic sugar for variables and assignments, and the use of slightly different syntax for internal choice and parallel composition.

=== Others ===

&quot;VisualNets&quot; produces animated visualisations of CSP systems from specifications, and supports timed CSP.

&quot;CSPsim&quot; is a lazy simulator. It does not model check CSP, but is useful for exploring very large (potentially infinite) systems.

SyncStitch is a CSP refinement checker with interactive modeling and analyzing environment. It has a graphical state-transition diagram editor. The user can model the behavior of processes as not only CSP expressions but also state-transition diagrams. The result of checking are also reported graphically as computation-trees and can be analyzed interactively with peripheral inspecting tools. In addition to refinement checks, It can perform deadlock check and livelock check.

== Related formalisms ==
Several other specification languages and formalisms have been derived from, or inspired by, the classic untimed CSP, including:
* Timed CSP, which incorporates timing information for reasoning about real-time systems
* Receptive Process Theory, a specialization of CSP that assumes an asynchronous (i.e. nonblocking) send operation
* CSPP
* HCSP
* TCOZ, an integration of Timed CSP and Object Z
* Circus, an integration of CSP and Z based on the Unifying Theories of Programming
* CML (COMPASS Modelling Language), a combination of Circus and VDM developed for the modelling of Systems of Systems (SoS)
* CspCASL, an extension of CASL that integrates CSP
* LOTOS, an international standard that incorporates features of CSP and CCS.
* PALPS, a probabilistic extension with locations for ecological models developed by Anna Philippou and Mauricio Toro Bermúdez

== Comparison with the actor model ==

In as much as it is concerned with concurrent processes that exchange messages, the actor model is broadly similar to CSP. However, the two models make some fundamentally different choices with regard to the primitives they provide:
* CSP processes are anonymous, while actors have identities.
* CSP uses explicit channels for message passing, whereas actor systems transmit messages to named destination actors. These approaches may be considered duals of each other, in the sense that processes receiving through a single channel effectively have an identity corresponding to that channel, while the name-based coupling between actors may be broken by constructing actors that behave as channels.
* CSP message-passing fundamentally involves a rendezvous between the processes involved in sending and receiving the message, i.e. the sender cannot transmit a message until the receiver is ready to accept it. In contrast, message-passing in actor systems is fundamentally asynchronous, i.e. message transmission and reception do not have to happen at the same time, and senders may transmit messages before receivers are ready to accept them. These approaches may also be considered duals of each other, in the sense that rendezvous-based systems can be used to construct buffered communications that behave as asynchronous messaging systems, while asynchronous systems can be used to construct rendezvous-style communications by using a message/acknowledgement protocol to synchronize senders and receivers.

Note that the aforementioned properties do not necessarily refer to the original CSP paper by Hoare, but rather the modern incarnation of the idea as seen in implementations such as Go and Clojure&#x27;s core.async. In the original paper, channels were not a central part of the specification, and the sender and receiver processes actually identify each other by name.

==Award==
In 1990, “A Queen’s Award for Technological Achievement has been conferred ... on [Oxford University] Computing Laboratory. The award recognises a successful collaboration between the laboratory and Inmos Ltd. … Inmos’ flagship product is the ‘transputer’, a microprocessor with many of the parts that would normally be needed in addition built into the same single component.” 
According to Tony Hoare,
“The INMOS Transputer was as embodiment of the ideas … of building microprocessors that could communicate with each other along wires that would stretch between their terminals. The founder had the vision that the CSP ideas were ripe for industrial exploitation, and he made that the basis of the language for programming Transputers, which was called Occam. … The company estimated it enabled them to deliver the hardware one year earlier than would otherwise have happened. They applied for and won a Queen’s award for technological achievement, in conjunction with Oxford University Computing Laboratory.”

<doc id="247372" wikidata="Q2979687" url="?curid=247372" title="HKS (company)">
<text>is a publicly traded company headquartered in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan specializing in the engineering, manufacturing, and sales of high performance aftermarket and accessory automotive parts and components. With 50 years in business, and global efforts in aftermarket parts and motorsport, the company claims, &quot;HKS is perhaps the most known aftermarket brand in the world&quot;.

==History==
HKS was formed in 1973 by Hiroyuki Hasegawa, a former engineer for Yamaha Motor Company, and his partner Goichi Kitagawa, while the start up capital was supplied by Sigma Automotive (hence the name HKS). The company began operations by tuning gasoline engines in a dairy-farming shed at the foot of Mount Fuji. Their goal was to design and build high performance engines and components that major original equipment manufacturers could not, or would not, produce.

In July 1974, Hasegawa engineered and built the first commercialized turbocharger kit for passenger automobiles. Since then HKS has been developing turbocharger upgrades and bolt-on turbocharger kits that subsequently became the company&#x27;s core business. HKS also created the first commercially available electronic turbo timer and boost controller, and also pioneered piggy-back fuel computers and aftermarket fuel management tools.

In 1984, HKS brought in the Nara-based tuning and service shop Twin Power Co., Ltd. under the new name of HKS Kansai Service Co., Ltd. as an affiliated partner with HKS. The shop served as a service center, tuning partner, parts distributor, and R&amp;D partner for HKS. In 2002, HKS Kansai Service became a major suspension overhaul and servicing center for HKS suspension customers. HKS Kansai Service also gained their own accolades and accomplishments in motorsport and even began developing their own aftermarket parts. In 2010, the official affiliation came to a close and the company was renamed to Kansai Service Co., Ltd. but it still maintains a good working relationship with HKS.

In July 1984, HKS built a new factory in Kamiide, Fujinomiya, not far from the site of the original shop at the Mount Fuji dairy-farming shed. In April 1985, HKS built an additional factory in Kitayama specifically for muffler production for both HKS and on consignment. In 2003, the first HKS Technical Factory was established in Toda, Saitama and later another was established in Sapporo. These technical factories serve as HKS-owned service, tuning, and development centers, as well as offering the sale of select HKS complete vehicles and parts. Additionally, a dedicated HKS Service Center was also established in Kitakyushu. The company also operates three sales offices within Japan, in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. The HKS headquarters remains near Mount Fuji with its main 100,000 square foot manufacturing and R&amp;D facility in Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture with an international sales and distribution network spanning Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas to support its customer base.

The subsidiary HKS USA was originally established in 1982 but shut down operations in 2011, with HKS electing instead to use wholesale distributors to handle their supply chain in the USA. Motovicity Distribution was selected as the North American master distributor in 2011. HKS USA was reestablished in 2017 as the consolidated subsidiary HKS USA, Inc. in Chandler, Arizona. In May 2020, Motovicity Distribution&#x27;s assets were acquired by Turn 14 Distribution for authorized distribution of HKS&#x27;s products in the United States. Additional subsidiary companies have been established in Cambridgeshire, England (HKS Europe) in 1996, Bangkok, Thailand (HKS Thailand) in 2001, and Shanghai, China (HKS Shanghai) in 2012.

Since June 1999, HKS has been a publicly traded company, first with the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and later in 2004 on the JASDAQ Securities Exchange.

HKS also gained full ownership of the metal processing and manufacturing company Nissei Kogyo Co., Ltd. in May, 2000. Nissei Industries also produces crankshafts, camshafts, cylinders, pistons, and injector parts.

In 2024, HKS launched a new collaborative brand with Studie AG, a BMW-specific tuning company, named HKSTUDIE. The company specializes in manufacturing tuning parts for BMW sports cars, such as exhaust systems and coilover suspension.

==Products==

HKS also manufactures OEM parts to automakers from technologies developed in aftermarket tuning, and even in usage such as marine jets. The company also undertakes contract manufacturing for clients. HKS received the ISO 9001 quality management standard certification in 2010, certifying manufacturing standards for OEM and contract clients.

Additionally, the company has a division for compressed natural gas engineering, as well as bi-fuel systems that run on both gasoline and compressed natural gas. These systems are designed for usage in commercial trucks as well as road vehicles.

The subsidiary HKS Aviation was launched in 1996. The company produced the HKS 700E aircraft engine along with other light-sport aircraft products, but the subsidiary has since ceased operations.

The HKS IoT Connected Service division was launched in 2019 for engineering and manufacturing connected devices such as a 360° camera, sensor system, coronavirus countermeasure device, and shuttle bus safety device. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism approved the Shuttle Bus Safety Monitoring Device, named &quot;MAMORU&quot;, and HKS released it on March 31, 2023.

In 2021, the Ministry of the Environment commissioned HKS to join the &quot;Battery Exchangeable EV Development and Renewable Energy Utilization Group&quot; to aid in the development of exchangeable battery EV commercial (ExCVB) light-duty trucks. HKS began delivery demonstrations of prototypes at FamilyMart stores in November 2022.

==Motorsport==
Since the 1980s, HKS has competed in many forms of motorsports including time attack, drag racing, JTCC, JGTC, F3, D1 Grand Prix, Superbikes, plus many others. They also sponsor many racers to carry the HKS name and to become part of the HKS team. They notably have had the likes of Anthony Reid (Super Touring/JTCC), Nobuteru Taniguchi (D1 Grand Prix and time attack), Tetsuya Kawasaki (Drag racing), Akira Iida (Time attack), and Max Orido (Test driver) drive for their in-house team.

=== Time attack and speed records ===
Since 1983, HKS has been heavily involved in developing and racing cars for setting both time attack and speed records. In 1983, HKS developed the HKS M300, a highly tuned Toyota Celica XX with a twin-turbocharged 5M-GE engine, to set speed records. The M300 became the first ever Japanese automobile to exceed 300 km/h (186.41 mph) with a speed record of 301.25 km/h (187.19 mph) at the Yatabe proving grounds in 1983.

In 1993, the HKS T-001, a modified Toyota Supra (A80), was developed for time attack and speed trials. It produced over 730 ps (720 hp), reached 344 km/h (214 mph), and set a lap time at the Tsukuba Circuit of 1 minute 1.97 seconds.In 1995, the team began testing with the HKS T-002, a specially tuned Nissan Skyline GT-R (R33). The T-002 set the lap record at the Tsukuba Circuit at 58.71 seconds, and a 0 to 300 km/h (186.41 mph) record of 17.64 seconds at Yatabe. It also went on to win Best Tuning Vehicle at the Tokyo Auto Salon.

The next HKS time attack vehicle, the HKS TRB-01 (an internal codename for &quot;Tsukuba Record Breaker&quot;), also known as the HKS Racing Altezza, was launched at the 2000 Tokyo Auto Salon. It was a tuned Toyota Altezza producing over 600 hp with extensive weight-saving, aerodynamic, and handling methods taken. It went on to set a new lap record at the Tsukuba Circuit of 55.85 seconds, driven by Nobuteru Taniguchi.

The HKS TRB-02, a time attack Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII, was developed in 2003. Taniguchi set a lap record at Tsukuba in 2003 of 55.00 seconds and in 2004 of 54.73 seconds. It produced 560ps (552 hp) out of a tuned and turbocharged 4G63.

To compete in additional time attack events domestically and internationally, the HKS Racing Performer CT230R was developed in 2006. This tuned Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX set numerous lap records across Japan: 1 minute 42.37 seconds at Fuji Speedway, 1 minute 21.53 seconds at Tokachi Speedway, 1 minute 32.53 seconds at Okayama International Circuit, 1 minute 17.47 seconds at Central Circuit, 1 minute 23.15 seconds at Sportsland Sugo, and 53.99 seconds at Tsukuba Circuit. In the United States, the CT230R set a new record of 1 minute 43.52 seconds at Buttonwillow Raceway.

For the World Time Attack Challenge from 2014 to 2016, HKS developed the HKS GT1000+ Nissan GT-R R35. As the name implies, the GT1000+ produces over 1000 ps at 1200 ps (1183 hp). Driven by Taniguchi, the GT1000+ set a class record at Fuji Speedway of 1 minute 39.85 seconds in 2014 and 1 minute 37.77 seconds in 2015. It also won its class at the WTAC at Sydney Motorsport Park with a time of 1 minute 30.83 seconds. Notably, these lap records claim to be the fastest of any Nissan GT-R R35, and are even on par with the Nissan GT-R GT3 race car.

HKS returned to the Tsukuba Circuit in 2018 with the HKS TRB-03, a time attack Toyota 86 producing over 811 ps (800 hp). The TRB-03, again driven by Taniguchi, went on to set a new record and broke the 50-second barrier at Tsukuba with a lap time of 49.44 seconds. The TRB-03 also participated in the 2018 World Time Attack Challenge.

Later in 2018, HKS began a project to set the record for a front-wheel-drive tuner car at Tsukuba with the HKS TRB-04 Suzuki Swift. The TRB-04 weighed 930 kg (2050 lb) with a stripped body that heavily used carbon fiber, and was powered by a 4G63 MIVEC inline-four engine making 500 ps (492 hp) with an HKS GTIII turbocharger and sequential transmission. Taniguchi set the FF record at the time, with a lap time of 55.498 seconds in January 2019.

In the early 1990s, HKS undertook a Formula One engine development program, to hopefully produce a motor in-house for use in F1 race cars. The result was the HKS 300E in 1992. The 300E was a 3.5-litre V12 (75 degree, five-valves per cylinder) producing 680 ps (671 hp) on pump gas with a 13,500 RPM redline. The engine was comparable to other F1 V12s of the era such as the Honda RA121E and Ferrari Tipo 038. It was tested in a Lola T91/50 F3000 chassis at Fuji Speedway. The program produced valuable engineering, technology, and brand value growth for HKS. However, the 300E was never used in competition and the Formula One engine program was closed after two years.

=== Japanese Touring Car Championship ===
HKS entered in the 1992 Japanese Touring Car Championship Group A, the top Japanese automobile race at the time. The team won the race at Sugo with the specially developed HKS Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32). This R32 Skyline GT-R gained popularity with its HKS &quot;Oil Slick&quot; livery, growth of the HKS brand during the period, and coverage in &quot;Option&quot; magazine, as well as the general success of the R32 GT-R within homologated Group A motorsports at the time.

From 1994 to 1997, the team entered the HKS Vauxhall Cavalier and HKS Opel Vectra in the JTCC. The team won three races in 1994, finishing 4th overall in 1994 and 1995. HKS also won the 12th race in 1997.

In these drag racing series and other international drag racing competitions, the HKS team also developed the HKS Drag 70 Supra which set a 7-second 1/4 mile in 1991, the HKS Drag R33 GT-R which produced 1300 ps (1282 hp) and set a record 7.67 second 1/4 mile making it the world&#x27;s fastest AWD car in 2001, and the HKS Drag 80 Supra which produced 1400 ps (1381 hp) and a sub-7 second 1/4 mile in 2001.

=== Japanese Formula 3 Championship ===

In the inaugural D1 Grand Prix drifting series in 2001, the HKS-sponsored Team After Fire Nissan S15 Silvia won the championship, driven by Nobuteru Taniguchi. In 2002, the HKS works team officially entered with a S15 Silvia, winning the 2nd round, and finishing as the runner-up for the season championship. The team then finished 4th for the 2003 season, after winning the last round.

The HKS team entered a modified Toyota Altezza entitled the &quot;Racing Performer IS220R&quot; in the 2004 series, won the 4th round and finishing in 2nd place as the championship runner-up. The Racing Performer IS220-Z was revealed for the 2006 series.

After a six-year hiatus, HKS returned to the D1GP in 2012 with the HKS Racing Performer 86 driven by Taniguchi and finished in 10th place.

The HKS works team continued to compete through 2014, whereafter HKS has chosen to instead sponsor and assist in tuning for other drift teams such as Team Toyo Tires Drift, Fat Five Racing, and Evangelion Racing. HKS-sponsored Daigo Saito later won the 2016 D1GP Championship.

The team won the first round at the Kyoto Cosmos Park, a fifth round heat at the Wajima City Monzen Motor Sports Park, the seventh round at Auto Park Imajyo, and the eighth round at Techniques Stage Takata.

With the victories during the 2023 season, HKS and Taguchi won the 2023 All Japan Dirt Trial Championship, marking a series championship win for their first full season of participation.

During the 2024 season, HKS won rounds 1, 3, and 5, and clinched the 2024 All Japan Dirt Trial Championship by the 6th race with 3 races left on the calendar.

<text>A hymnwriter (or hymn writer, hymnist, hymnodist, hymnographer, etc.) is someone who writes the text, music, or both of hymns. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the composition of hymns dates back to before the time of David, who is traditionally believed to have composed many of the Psalms. The term hymnodist, in the United States more than in other regions, broadens the scope to include the study of hymns.

==History==
===Early Church and Middle Ages===

Many hymn writers in the early Church gained prominence and achieved canonisation. Saint John of Damascus ( or 676 – 749) was noted for his work as a hymn writer; some of the most popular English hymns which are translations of his works include &quot;Come ye faithful, raise the strain&quot;, &quot;Let us rise in early morning&quot; and &quot;The day of resurrection&quot;, all associated with the season of Eastertide and all translated by John Mason Neale.

Most early hymnists were anonymous, so it is uncertain how many of them were women. Saint Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) is the earliest known female hymnist outside hymnists recorded in the Bible.

===Post-Reformation===

Many leaders of the Reformation, including Martin Luther (1483–1546) himself, were hymn writers; Luther&#x27;s work included &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A mighty fortress is our God&quot;) and &quot;Christ lag in Todesbanden (Christ Jesus lay in death&#x27;s strong bonds)&quot;. Lutherans continued to compose hymns, and some of the popular hymn writers of the 16th and 17th centuries included the three saints commemorated in the American Lutheran Calendar of Saints on 26 October: Philipp Nicolai (1556–1608), Johann Heermann (1585–1647), and Paul Gerhardt (1607–76). Michael Praetorius (1571–1621), and Johann Crüger (1598–1662) also gained renown as German Lutheran hymn writers of that era.

In the English-speaking world, the art of writing hymns was brought to prominence by the approximately 750 hymns composed by Isaac Watts (1674–1748), followed by the almost tenfold Watts&#x27; output composed a generation later by co-founder of Methodism, Charles Wesley (1707–88).

===Nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries===

Major modern publishers include the Jubilate Group and Stainer &amp; Bell in the UK; CanticaNOVA Publications, World Library Publications and Oregon Catholic Press in the US; and Willow Publishing in Australia.

Leading British hymn writers have included John Henry Newman (1801–1890), John Mason Neale (1818–1866), William Herbert Jude (1851–1922), Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926–2024), Michael Perry (1942–96), Michael Saward (1932–2015), Christopher Idle (born 1938), Fred Pratt Green (1903–2000), as well as James Quinn (1919–2010) and Brian Foley (1919–2000). More recent evangelical hymn/songwriters have included Stuart Townend (born 1963), Keith Getty (born 1974) and his wife Kristyn Getty (born 1980).

Other modern hymn writers include French-American Lucien Deiss (1921–2007) and Australian duo James McAuley (1917–76) and Richard Connolly (born 1927). In the 21st century, Lu Xiaomin composed over 1,800 songs of praise for Chinese house churches, called the Canaan Hymns.

<doc id="247381" wikidata="Q7068952" url="?curid=247381" title="Null cipher">
<text>A null cipher, also known as concealment cipher, is an ancient form of encryption where the plaintext is mixed with a large amount of non-cipher material. Today it is regarded as a simple form of steganography, which can be used to hide ciphertext.

This is one of three categories of cipher used in classical cryptography along with substitution ciphers and transposition ciphers.

== Classical cryptography ==
In classical cryptography, a &quot;null&quot; is an extra character intended to confuse the cryptanalyst. In the most common form of a null cipher, the plaintext is included within the ciphertext and one needs to discard certain characters in order to decrypt the message (such as first letter, last letter, third letter of every second word, etc.) Most characters in such a cryptogram are nulls, only some are significant, and some others can be used as pointers to the significant ones.

Here is an example null cipher message, sent by a German during World War I:

Taking the first letter of every word reveals the hidden message &quot;Pershing sails from N.Y. June I&quot;.

Following is a more complicated example from England&#x27;s Civil War which aided Royalist Sir John Trevanian in his escape from a Puritan castle in Colchester:WORTHIE SIR JOHN,

HOPE, THAT IS YE BESTE COMFORT OF YE AFFLICTED, CANNOT MUCH, I FEAR ME, HELP YOU NOW. THAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU, IS THIS ONLY: IF EVER I MAY BE ABLE TO REQUITE THAT I DO OWE YOU, STAND NOT UPON ASKING ME. TIS NOT MUCH THAT I CAN DO; BUT WHAT I CAN DO, BEE YE VERY SURE I WILL. I KNOW THAT, IF DETHE COMES, IF ORDINARY MEN FEAR IT, IT FRIGHTS NOT YOU, ACCOUNTING IT FOR A HIGH HONOUR, TO HAVE SUCH A REWARDE OF YOUR LOYALTY. PRAY YET YOU MAY BE SPARED THIS SOE BITTER, CUP. I FEAR NOT THAT YOU WILL GRUDGE ANY SUFFERINGS; ONLY IF BIE SUBMISSIONS YOU CAN TURN THEM AWAY, TIS THE PART OF A WISE MAN. TELL ME, AN IF YOU CAN, TO DO FOR YOU ANYTHINGE THAT YOU WOLDE HAVE DONE. THE GENERAL GOES BACK ON WEDNESDAY. RESTINGE YOUR SERVANT TO COMMAND.The third letter after each punctuation reveals &quot;Panel at East end of Chapel slides&quot;.

A similar technique is to hide entire words, such as in this seemingly innocent message written by a prison inmate but deciphered by the FBI:

Taking only every fifth word, one can reconstruct the hidden text which recommends a &quot;hit&quot; on someone:

Historically, users of concealment ciphers often used substitution and transposition ciphers on the data prior to concealment. For example, Cardinal Richelieu is said to have used a grille to write secret messages, after which the blank spaces were filled out with extraneous matter to create the impression of a continuous text.

== Dot concealment cipher ==
A dot or pinprick concealment cipher is a common classical encryption method in which dot or pinprick is placed above or below certain letters in a piece of writing. An early reference to this appears in Aeneas Tacticus&#x27;s book &quot;On the Defense of Fortifications.&quot; The Germans improved upon this, using a dot of invisible ink during World War I and World War II.

In 19th-century England, pinpricks in newspapers were once a popular way to send letters with little or no cost.

If dots were placed far apart, this cipher could be used effectively. The dots should be small and the null text must make sense in the context of the senders and their relationship. Both also must have agreed on the page, chapter, article, or section to be used, typically several. Another option is to have an indicator, such as the date in a newspaper, which shows which page the message is on. This version is less secure.

== Acrostics ==
The acrostic puzzle is an extended form of null cipher, but not an anacrostic (which uses a set of lettered clues with numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer to figure out the second part, a long series of numbered blanks and spaces representing a message into which the answers for the clues fit). Hidden or otherwise unmentioned acrostics are a type of null cipher.

This method can be used to secretly insult a famous or important individual. For example, Rolfe Humphries received a lifelong ban from contributing to Poetry Magazine after he wrote and tried to publish &quot;a poem containing a concealed scurrilous phrase aimed at a well-known person&quot;, namely Nicholas Murray Butler.

== Definition of a null ==
Put simply, a null cipher is any cipher which involves a number of &quot;nulls,&quot; or decoy letters. As well as the methods shown above, a null cipher could be plaintext words with nulls placed in designated areas or even a plaintext message broken up in different positions with a null at the end of each word. However, a message with only a couple nulls (for example, one at the beginning and one at the end) is &quot;not&quot; a null cipher.

A null cipher is technically only a term for hidden letters or words within an otherwise unimportant message, however, it is occasionally used for the entire category of concealment ciphers.

== Usage ==
In general, it is difficult and time-consuming to produce covert texts that seem natural and would not raise suspicion, but a null cipher is an option if one is unable to use an advanced encryption method and has ample time. If no key or additional encryption is involved, the security of the message relies entirely on the secrecy of the concealment method. In the present day, null ciphers are used by prison inmates in an attempt to have their messages pass inspection.

Null ciphers are one of three major cipher types in classical cryptography (the other types being substitution and transposition), but they are less well known than the others. They are often marked as a subcategory of transposition ciphers, but that is not true, as transposition ciphers are scrambled messages.

<doc id="247386" wikidata="Q153545" url="?curid=247386" title="Albrecht von Wallenstein">
<text>Albrecht Wenzel Eusebius von Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland (; 24 September 1583 – 25 February 1634), also von Waldstein (), was a Bohemian military leader and statesman who fought on the Catholic side during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). His successful martial career made him one of the richest and most influential men in the Holy Roman Empire by the time of his death. Wallenstein became the supreme commander of the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and was a major figure of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Wallenstein was born in the Kingdom of Bohemia into a poor Czech Protestant noble family, affiliated with the Utraquist Hussites, a group of notable anti-German sentiment in some of its circles, and following the teachings of the early reformer Jan Hus. He acquired a multilingual university education across Europe and converted to Catholicism in 1606. A marriage in 1609 to the wealthy widow of a Bohemian landowner gave him access to considerable estates and wealth after her death at an early age in 1614. 
Three years later, Wallenstein embarked on a career as a mercenary by raising forces for the Holy Roman Emperor in the Uskok War against the Republic of Venice.

Wallenstein fought for the Catholics in the Protestant Bohemian Revolt of 1618 and was awarded estates confiscated from the rebels after their defeat at White Mountain in 1620. A series of military victories against the Protestants raised Wallenstein&#x27;s reputation in the imperial court and in 1625 he raised a large army of 50,000 men to further the Imperial cause. A year later, he administered a crushing defeat to the Protestants at Dessau Bridge. For his successes, Wallenstein became an imperial count palatine and made himself ruler of the lands of the Duchy of Friedland in northern Bohemia.

An imperial &quot;generalissimo&quot; by land, and Admiral of the Baltic Sea from 21 April 1628, Wallenstein found himself released from service in 1630 after Ferdinand grew wary of his ambition. Several Protestant victories over Catholic armies induced Ferdinand to recall Wallenstein (Gollersdorf April 1632), who then defeated the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus at Alte Veste. The Swedish king was later killed at the Battle of Lützen. Wallenstein realised the war could last decades and, during the summer of 1633, arranged a series of armistices to negotiate peace. These proved to be his undoing as plotters accused him of treachery and Emperor Ferdinand II ordered his assassination. Dissatisfied with the Emperor&#x27;s treatment of him, Wallenstein considered allying with the Protestants. However, he was assassinated at Eger in Bohemia by one of the army&#x27;s officials, with the emperor&#x27;s approval.

==Early life==
Wallenstein was born on 24 September 1583 in Heřmanice, Bohemia, which is the easternmost and largest region in what was then the Holy Roman Empire, in the present-day Czech Republic, into a poor Protestant Wallenstein branch of an old House of Waldstein, who owned Heřmanice Castle and seven surrounding villages. He was the son of Vilem (Wilhelm) IV von Waldstein (z Valdštejna) (1547-1595) and his wife, Markéta, Baroness Smiřická of Smiřice (1555-1593).

They had raised him bilingually – the father spoke both Czech and German while his mother preferred Czech – yet Wallenstein in his childhood had a better command of Czech than of German. His parents&#x27; religious affiliations were Lutheranism and Utraquist Hussitism. After their deaths, Albrecht for two years lived with his maternal uncle Heinrich (Jindřich) Slavata of Chlum and Košumberk (1549-1599), a member of the Unity of the Brethren (Bohemian Brethren), and adopted his uncle&#x27;s religious affiliation. His uncle sent him to the brethren&#x27;s school at Košumberk Castle in Eastern Bohemia.

In 1597, Albrecht was sent to the Protestant Latin school at Goldberg (now Złotoryja) in Silesia, where the then-German environment led him to hone his German language skills. While German became Wallenstein&#x27;s main language, he is said to have continued to curse in Czech. On 29 August 1599, Wallenstein continued his education at the Protestant University of Altdorf near Nuremberg, Franconia, where he was often engaged in brawls and épée fights, leading to his imprisonment in the town prison. He beat his servant so badly he had to purchase him a new suit of clothes on top of paying compensation.

In February 1600, Albrecht left Altdorf and travelled around the Holy Roman Empire, France and Italy, where he studied at the universities of Bologna and Padua. By this time, Wallenstein was fluent in German, Czech, Latin and Italian, was able to understand Spanish, and spoke some French.

Wallenstein then joined the army of the Emperor Rudolf II in Hungary, where, under the command of Giorgio Basta, he saw two years of armed service (1604–1606) in the Long Turkish War against the Ottoman Turks and Hungarian rebels.
In 1604, his younger sister, Kateřina Anna of Waldstein (1584-1605), married the leader of the Moravian Protestants, Karel the Older of Zierotin (1564–1636). He then studied at the University of Olomouc (matriculating in 1606). His contact with the Olomouc Jesuits is considered to be at least partially responsible for his conversion to Catholicism that same year.
The contributory factor to his conversion may have been the Counter-Reformation policy of the Habsburgs that effectively barred Protestants from being appointed to higher offices at court in Bohemia and in Moravia, and the impressions he gathered in Catholic Italy. However, there are no sources clearly indicating the reasons for Wallenstein&#x27;s conversion, except for a subjunctive anecdote by his contemporary Count Franz Christoph von Khevenhüller (1588-1650) about the Virgin Mary saving Wallenstein&#x27;s life when he fell from a window in Innsbruck. Wallenstein was later made a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

In 1607, based on recommendations by his brother-in-law, Zierotin, and another relative, Adam of Waldstein, often mistakenly referred to as his uncle, Wallenstein was made chamberlain at the court of Matthias, and later also chamberlain to archdukes Ferdinand and Maximilian.

In 1609, Wallenstein married the Czech Anna Lucretia of Víckov, née Nekšová of Landek (1582-1614), the wealthy widow of Arkleb of Víckov who owned the towns of Vsetín, Lukov, Rymice and Všetuly/Holešov (all in eastern Moravia). She was three years older than Wallenstein, and he inherited her estates after her death in 1614.

He used his wealth to win favour, offering and commanding 200 horses for Archduke Ferdinand of Styria for his war with Venice in 1617, thereby relieving the fortress of Gradisca from the Venetian siege. He later endowed a monastery in his late wife&#x27;s name and had her reburied there.

In 1623, Wallenstein married Countess Isabella Katharina von Harrach (1601-1655), daughter of Count Karl von Harrach. They had two children: a son who died in infancy and a surviving daughter. Examples of the couple&#x27;s correspondence survive. The two marriages made him one of the wealthiest men in the Bohemian Crown.

==Thirty Years&#x27; War==

The Thirty Years&#x27; War began in 1618 when the estates of Bohemia rebelled against Ferdinand of Styria and elected Frederick V of the Palatinate, the leader of the Protestant Union, as their new king. Wallenstein associated himself with the cause of the Catholics and the Habsburg dynasty.
In the summer of 1618, Count Jindřich Matyáš Thurn led 10,000 troops into Moravia to secure their loyalty to the rebellion. Nobles who wished for a rapprochement with Ferdinand faced a choice. Senior nobleman Zierotin&#x27;s son-in-law, Georg von Nachod, commanded the Moravian cavalry and his brother-in-law, Wallenstein, the infantry. Both decided to take their regiment into Austria. Nachod&#x27;s troops rebelled and he fled for his life. Wallenstein&#x27;s major demanded authorisation from the Estates upon which Wallenstein drew his sword and ran him through, &quot;A fresh major was immediately appointed and displayed greater tractability&quot;. Deserting the Bohemians, he marched his regiment to Vienna taking with him the Moravian treasury. There, however, the authorities told him that the money would go back to the Moravians – but he had shown his loyalty to Ferdinand, the future Emperor.

Wallenstein equipped a regiment of cuirassiers and won great distinction under Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy in the wars against Ernst von Mansfeld and Gabriel Bethlen (both supporters of the Bohemian revolt) in Moravia. Wallenstein recovered his lands (which the rebels had seized in 1619) and after the Battle of White Mountain (8 November 1620), he secured the estates belonging to his mother&#x27;s family and confiscated tracts of Protestant lands.

He grouped his new possessions into a territory called Friedland (Frýdlant) in northern Bohemia. A series of successes in battle led to Wallenstein becoming in 1622 an imperial count palatine, in 1623 a prince, and in 1625 Duke of Friedland. Wallenstein proved an able administrator of the duchy and sent a large representation to Prague to emphasize his nobility.

In order to aid Ferdinand (elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1619) against the Northern Protestants and to produce a balance in the army of the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, Wallenstein offered to raise a whole army for the imperial service following the &quot;bellum se ipsum alet&quot; principle, and received his final commission on 25 July 1625. Wallenstein&#x27;s successes as a military commander brought him fiscal credit, which in turn enabled him to receive loans to buy lands, many of them being the former estates of conquered Bohemian nobles. He used his credit to grant loans to Ferdinand II, which were repaid through lands and titles. Wallenstein&#x27;s popularity soon recruited 30,000 (not long afterwards 50,000) men. The two armies worked together over 1625–27, at first against Mansfeld.
Having beaten Mansfeld at Dessau (25 April 1626), Wallenstein cleared Silesia of the remnants of Mansfeld&#x27;s army in 1627. His army ravaged and burned down many Silesian towns and villages, including Prudnik, Głogówek, Żory, Pszczyna, Bytom, Rybnik, Koźle, and Strzelce Opolskie.

At this time he bought from the emperor the Duchy of Sagan (in Silesia). He then joined Tilly in the struggle against Christian IV of Denmark, and afterwards gained as a reward the Duchies of Mecklenburg, whose hereditary dukes suffered expulsion for having helped the Danish king. This awarding of a major territory to someone of the lower nobility shocked the high-born rulers of many other German states.

Wallenstein assumed the title of &quot;Admiral of the North and Baltic Seas&quot;. However, in 1628 he failed to capture Stralsund, which resisted the Capitulation of Franzburg and the subsequent siege with assistance of Danish, Scottish and Swedish troops, a blow that denied him access to the Baltic and the chance to challenge the naval power of the Scandinavian kingdoms and of the Netherlands.

Although he succeeded in defeating Christian IV of Denmark in the Battle of Wolgast and neutralizing Denmark in the subsequent Peace of Lübeck, the situation further deteriorated when the presence of Imperial Catholic troops on the Baltic and the Emperor&#x27;s &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; brought King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden into the conflict. Wallenstein attempted to aid the forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth under Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, which were fighting Sweden in 1629. However, Wallenstein failed to engage any major Swedish forces and this significantly affected the outcome of the conflict.

Over the course of the war Wallenstein&#x27;s ambitions and the abuses of his forces had earned him a host of enemies, both Catholic and Protestant, princes and non-princes alike. Ferdinand suspected Wallenstein of planning a coup to take control of the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor&#x27;s advisors advocated dismissing him, and in September 1630 envoys were sent to Wallenstein to announce his dismissal. The decision was taken at Regensburg on 13 August 1630 on the following day Wallenstein&#x27;s financier De Witte committed suicide (having accrued a mountain of debt financing Wallenstein).

Wallenstein gave over his army to General Tilly and retired to Jičín, the capital of his Duchy of Friedland. There he lived in an atmosphere of &quot;mysterious magnificence&quot;.

However, circumstances forced Ferdinand to recall Wallenstein into the field. The successes of Gustavus Adolphus over General Tilly at the Battle of Breitenfeld and the Lech (1632), where Tilly was killed, and his advance to Munich and occupation of Bohemia, required a vigorous response. It was during this time that Wallenstein had taken inspiration from the reforms of Gustavus Adolphus, instituting harsh discipline by providing rewards for bravery and punishment for disorder, thievery, and cowardice and with this in mind Wallenstein raised a fresh army within a few weeks and took to the field. He drove the Saxon army from Bohemia and then advanced against Gustavus Adolphus, whom he opposed near Nuremberg and, after the Battle of the Alte Veste, dislodged. In November, the great Battle of Lützen was fought, in which Wallenstein was forced to retreat but, in the confused melee, Gustavus Adolphus was killed. Wallenstein withdrew to winter quarters in Bohemia.

In the campaigning of 1633, Wallenstein&#x27;s apparent unwillingness to attack the enemy caused much concern in Vienna and in Spain. At this time the dimensions of the war had grown more European, and Wallenstein had begun preparing to desert the Emperor. He expressed anger at Ferdinand&#x27;s refusal to revoke the Edict of Restitution. Historic records tell little about his secret negotiations but some sources indicated he was preparing to force a &quot;just peace&quot; on the Emperor &quot;in the interests of united Germany&quot;. With this apparent &quot;plan&quot; he entered into negotiations with Saxony, Brandenburg, Sweden, and France. Apparently the Habsburgs&#x27; enemies tried to draw him to their side. In any case, he gained little support. Anxious to make his power felt, he resumed the offensive against the Swedes and Saxons, winning his last victory at Steinau on the Oder in October. He then resumed negotiations.

==Assassination==
In December, Wallenstein retired with his army to Bohemia, around Pilsen (now Plzeň). Vienna soon definitely convinced itself of his treachery, a secret court found him guilty, and the Emperor looked seriously for a means of getting rid of him (a successor in command, the later emperor Ferdinand III, was already waiting). Wallenstein was aware of the plan to replace him, but felt confident that when the army came to decide between him and the Emperor the decision would be in his favour.
On 24 January 1634 the Emperor signed a secret patent (shown only to certain officers of Wallenstein&#x27;s army) removing him from his command. Finally an open patent charging Wallenstein with high treason was signed on 18 February and published in Prague.

In the patent, Ferdinand II ordered Wallenstein brought under arrest to Vienna, dead or alive.

Losing the support of his army, Wallenstein now realized the extent of his peril, and on 23 February with a company of some hundred men, he went from Plzeň to Cheb, hoping to meet the Swedes under Prince Bernard.

After his arrival at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish officers in his force assassinated him on the night of 25 February. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter Butler and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first attacked Wallenstein&#x27;s trusted officers (Adam Trczka, Vilém Kinský, Christian von Ilow, and Henry Neumann), while they attended a feast at Cheb Castle, to which the officers had been invited by Gordon himself.

According to historian, A. E. J. Hollaender, quoting the &quot;holograph account&quot; of Denis MacDonell, aka Dionysius Macdaniel, Irish Captain of Colonel Butler&#x27;s regiment and participant in the events, Captain Walter Devereux with twelve dragoons and Sergeant Major Geraldine with eight burst into the room from two doors, surprising the feasting guests. Geraldine cried out &quot;Vivat Ferdinandus Imperator&quot; (&quot;Long live Emperor Ferdinand&quot;) with MacDonell responding with &quot;Et tota Domus Austriaca&quot; (&quot;And the whole House of Austria&quot;). By another account, as quoted in Peter H. Wilson&#x27;s work on the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the conspirators entered the room shouting &quot;Who is a good Imperialist?&quot;. All of Wallenstein&#x27;s loyal officers present were massacred. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers.

A few hours later, Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster&#x27;s house at the main square where Wallenstein had been lodging, and kicked open the bedroom door. Wallenstein, roused from sleep and unarmed, is said to have asked for quarter but Devereux ran his spear through Wallenstein, killing him. The Emperor rewarded the assassins.

In 1784, his descendant Vincenc von Wallenstein had the remains of the general and his wife transported from the Carthusian monastery in Valdice, after the monastery was abolished in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II, to St. Anne&#x27;s Chapel in the town of Mnichovo Hradiště, in the Czech Republic.

==Obsession with horoscopes==
While a student at Padua, Wallenstein had followed the lessons of the prominent astrologer Andrea Argoli, who had also initiated him into the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

In 1608, Wallenstein commissioned the imperial court mathematician Johannes Kepler issue his first horoscope through intermediaries. It seems that he did not receive the horoscope until late 1614 or early 1615. &quot;Why delivery should have taken so long is anyone&#x27;s guess. Perhaps Kepler had been defrauded too often and did not want too hand it over until he had his promised fee and that had been delayed.&quot; Wallenstein, through the same intermediary (Gerhard von Taxis) reached out to Kepler again in 1625 for amendments and amplifications on the chart.

Consulting an astrologer was not unusual at the time. Though astrology had been forbidden by the Church at the Council of Trent, Emperor Rudolph II (a nominally Catholic monarch and the ruler of Bohemia where Wallenstein served as his vassal) frequently consulted astrologers as did many at his court. Anyone who was wealthy and influential often had one. After a brief warning not to trust the stars alone, Kepler wrote that his client had a busy, restless mind who strove for new, untried or strange means. The horoscope characterized Wallenstein as a person with great ambition who strove for power. Dangerous enemies may challenge him, but he would mostly win. Wallenstein relied obsessively on horoscopes for the next several years prior to his death in 1634.

==Chronic illness==
Wallenstein began to suffer joint inflammation in the feet in 1620. It was believed to be a case of gout, or by excessive drinking. His condition deteriorated rapidly.

In November 1629 he became so ill that he lay down for weeks. In March 1630 he travelled to Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad) to seek relief. He found it difficult to walk. At the Battle of Lützen in November 1632, he mounted his horse in extreme pain. Half a year later he was no longer able to ride. On his flight to Eger in 1634 he had to be moved around in a wagon or lying in a transport litter.

In the 1970s the skeleton of Wallenstein was examined. The inner core of the leg bones showed abnormal changes that suggest terminal syphilis.

==Legacy==

=== Contemporaries ===
Shortly after Wallenstein&#x27;s assassination, several plays, poems and newspapers appeared, as well as a large number of pamphlets describing his life and death. Most of these early adaptations are completely unknown today and have often been lost.

=== Literature ===

==== Schiller&#x27;s Wallenstein ====
Schiller first commemorated Wallenstein as a historian in his extensive history of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In his play trilogy, completed in 1788, he concentrated mostly on the last period of Wallenstein&#x27;s life (Pilsen and Eger). The literary depiction largely corresponds to the historical facts with the only exception being the lovers – Ottavio Piccolomini&#x27;s fictional son Max and Wallenstein&#x27;s daughter Thekla. Although Wallenstein had a daughter, Maria Elisabeth, she was only ten years old when he died, and Piccolomini&#x27;s adopted son Joseph Silvio Max Piccolomini was only one year older.

==== Alfred Döblin&#x27;s novel ====
Wallenstein is also a main figure in Alfred Döblin&#x27;s eponymous novel. The title of the novel, published in 1920, is misleading, as it does not focus on Wallenstein, but rather on Emperor Ferdinand II, whom Döblin consistently calls Ferdinand the Other (German: &quot;Ferdinand der Andere&quot;). The sections of the book are also often misleadingly named. For example, the first book is called Maximilian of Bavaria, although it is almost exclusively about the emperor and his actions that are described. The supposed protagonist of this part is only mentioned in passing.

In the beginning, Döblin describes the emperor according to historical facts but enriches these descriptions with fictional elements. The description of the last phase of Ferdinand&#x27;s life and his death then have nothing to do with historical reality but are entirely a result of Döblin&#x27;s artistic freedom.

In the second book of the novel, Wallenstein is introduced rather marginally. He only becomes present with the events during his work within the Bohemian coin consortium. This corresponds to Döblin&#x27;s interpretation of Wallenstein in the novel as a whole. For Döblin, Wallenstein&#x27;s economic genius predominates; battles are only fought when they cannot be avoided, as Döblin mainly portrays Wallenstein as a modern manager of long-term war planning. Wallenstein is indifferent to religious questions, forcing his partners and opponents to admit to a lie of which they were not even aware. Just like Wallenstein, they strive for power and wealth but hide this pursuit behind their religious convictions and assurances of peace. Döblin&#x27;s Wallenstein has no political vision, and even less does he want to reform the empire. All that matters to him is wealth and power. Döblin&#x27;s judgment of Wallenstein is thus close to Marxist historiography, which sees all action as the result of economic motives.

==== Biographies by Hellmut Diwald and Golo Mann ====
Hellmut Diwald first began to write a biography of Wallenstein in 1967 with the publication of Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte Wallensteins&quot; (English: &quot;History of Wallenstein&quot;), to which he added a hundred-page introduction. Two years later, his portrayal of Wallenstein appeared, which was soon regarded as a new standard reference. Golo Mann must have realized this two years before the publication of his biography &quot;Wallenstein. Sein Leben erzählt von Golo Mann&quot;. &quot;He was downright disgusted by the apologetic Hellmut Diwald&quot; (Klaus-Dietmar Henke). The editor of the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Rudolf Augstein, judged Mann&#x27;s work to be &quot;a highly subjective representation that pretends to be objective&quot;.

==== El Prodigio de Alemania ====
He is also the subject of Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s play &quot;El Prodigio de Alemania&quot;.

=== Festivals ===
In Memmingen, the Wallenstein Festival (&#x27;) is held every four years to commemorate Wallenstein&#x27;s stay in the town in 1630. In Altdorf bei Nürnberg, the Wallenstein Festival (&quot;Wallenstein-Festspiele&quot;) has been held every three years since 1894. The plays &#x27; and an adaptation of Schiller&#x27;s Wallenstein trilogy are performed. In the city of Stralsund, the Wallenstein Days (&quot;&quot;), the largest historical festival in northern Germany, takes place every year and commemorates the liberation of the city from the siege by Wallenstein in 1628.

=== Museums ===
By imperial decree of Franz Joseph I on 28 February 1863, Wallenstein was included in the list of &quot;Austria&#x27;s most famous warlords and generals worthy of eternal admiration&quot; and a life-size statue was erected in the Feldherrenhalle of the then newly built &quot;Imperial-Royal Court Weapons Museum&quot;, now the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The statue was created in 1877 by the sculptor Ludwig Schimek (1837–1886) from Carrara marble.
The Cheb Regional Museum has a permanent exhibition dedicated to Wallenstein. In addition to portraits and paintings, his stuffed horse, the room where he was murdered and his murder weapon, are on display. In the museum of Lützen Castle, Wallenstein is portrayed as a general in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and in the Battle of Lützen.

A visit to the Wallestein Palace, which the general had built between 1623 and 1630 in Prague&#x27;s district of Malá Strana, offers an insight into the life of the Generalissimo. The Czech National Museum produced a large exhibition about Wallenstein at the same palace from 15 November 2007 to 15 February 2008.

=== Music ===
Composer Bedřich Smetana honored Wallenstein in his 1859 symphonic poem &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot;, which was originally intended as an overture to a play by Schiller.

Josef Rheinberger composed a symphonic tone painting &quot;Wallenstein&quot; in 1866. The work in four movements is also called a symphony. It was premiered in Munich on 26 November 1866.

Composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy honored Wallenstein in his 1871 symphonic triptych &quot;Wallenstein&quot;.

=== Other ===

Wallenstein is examined by economist Arthur Salz in his book &quot;Wallenstein als Merkantilist&quot; (&quot;Wallenstein as Mercantilist&quot;).

A Czech television film &quot;Popel a hvězdy&quot; (&quot;The Ashes and The Stars&quot;) about Albrecht von Wallenstein was produced in 1990 by Czech Television. Jiří Adamíra stars as Wallenstein.

<text>HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was a 98-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched from Woolwich Dockyard on 24 October 1805. She was the only ship built to her draught, and designed by Sir John Henslow.

She was converted to serve as a depot ship in 1841, and was eventually broken up in 1875. Her figurehead is preserved at Queenborough, Kent.
