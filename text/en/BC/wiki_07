<text>The Bovidae comprise the biological family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes cattle, bison, buffalo, antelopes (including goat-antelopes), sheep and goats. A member of this family is called a bovid. With 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family Bovidae consists of 11 (or two) major subfamilies and thirteen major tribes. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene.

The bovids show great variation in size and pelage colouration. Except some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species, females possess horns, too. The size and shape of the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.

Most bovids are diurnal. Social activity and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use different forms of vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate at least once a year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.

The greatest diversities of bovids occur in Africa. The maximum concentration of species is in the savannas of Eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes a number of domesticated species, including three whose use has spread worldwide, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products, such as milk, butter, and cheese, are manufactured largely from domestic cattle. Bovids are also raised for their leather, meat, and wool.

==Naming and etymology==
The name &quot;Bovidae&quot; was given by the British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1821. The word &quot;Bovidae&quot; is the combination of the prefix &quot;bov-&quot; (originating from Latin , &quot;ox&quot;, through Late Latin ) and the suffix &quot;-idae&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

The family Bovidae is placed in the order Artiodactyla (which includes the even-toed ungulates). It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the ungulates, and 300 known extinct species.

Until the beginning of the 21st century it was understood that the family Moschidae (musk deer) was sister to Cervidae. However, a 2003 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of National Museum of Natural History, France) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae form a clade sister to Cervidae. According to the study, Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28 million years ago. The following cladogram is based on the 2003 study.

Molecular studies have supported monophyly in the family Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions of as many as ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies: Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains &quot;Tethytragus&quot; (mid-Miocene).

In 1992, Alan W . Gentry of the Natural History Museum, London divided the eight major subfamilies of Bovidae into two major clades on the basis of their evolutionary history: the Boodontia, which comprised only the Bovinae, and the Aegodontia, which consisted of the rest of the subfamilies. Boodonts have somewhat primitive teeth, resembling those of oxen, whereas aegodonts have more advanced teeth like those of goats.

A controversy exists about the recognition of Peleinae and Pantholopinae, comprising the genera &quot;Pelea&quot; and &quot;Pantholops&quot; respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested the inclusion of &quot;Pelea&quot; in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of &quot;Pelea&quot;, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. &quot;Pantholops&quot;, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the inclusion of &quot;Pantholops&quot; in Caprinae.

Below is a cladogram based on Yang &quot;et al&quot;.&quot;,&quot; 2013 and Calamari, 2021:

Alternatively, all members of the Aegodontia can be classified within the subfamily Antilopinae, with the individual subfamilies being tribes in this treatment.

==Evolutionary history==
===Early Miocene and before===

In the early Miocene, bovids began diverging from the cervids (deer) and giraffids. The earliest bovids, whose presence in Africa and Eurasia in the latter part of early Miocene (20 Mya) has been ascertained, were small animals, somewhat similar to modern gazelles, and probably lived in woodland environments. &quot;Eotragus&quot;, the earliest known bovid, weighed and was nearly the same in size as the Thomson&#x27;s gazelle. Early in their evolutionary history, the bovids split into two main clades: Boodontia (of Eurasian origin) and Aegodontia (of African origin). This early split between Boodontia and Aegodontia has been attributed to the continental divide between these land masses. When these continents were later rejoined, this barrier was removed, and both groups expanded into the territory of the other. The tribes Bovini and Tragelaphini diverged in the early Miocene. Bovids are known to have reached the Americas in the Pleistocene by crossing the Bering land bridge.

The present genera of Alcelaphinae appeared in the Pliocene. The extinct Alcelaphine genus &quot;Paramularius&quot;, which was the same in size as the hartebeest, is believed to have come into being in the Pliocene, but became extinct in the middle Pleistocene. Several genera of Hippotraginae are known since the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This subfamily appears to have diverged from the Alcelaphinae in the latter part of early Miocene. The Bovinae are believed to have diverged from the rest of the Bovidae in the early Miocene. The Boselaphini became extinct in Africa in the early Pliocene; their latest fossils were excavated in Langebaanweg (South Africa) and Lothagam (Kenya).

===Middle Miocene===
The middle Miocene marked the spread of the bovids into China and the Indian subcontinent. According to Vrba, the radiation of the subfamily Alcelaphinae began in the latter part of middle Miocene. The Caprinae tribes probably diverged in the early middle Miocene. The Caprini emerged in the middle Miocene, and seem to have been replaced by other bovids and cervids in Eurasia. The earliest fossils of the antilopines are from the middle Miocene, though studies show the existence of the subfamily from the early Miocene. Speciation occurred in the tribe Antilopini during the middle or upper Miocene, mainly in Eurasia. Tribe Neotragini seems to have appeared in Africa by the end of Miocene, and had become widespread by the Pliocene.

===Late Miocene===
By the late Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, leading to the creation of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and no significant difference in the sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of ovibovines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.

=== Plio-Pleistocene ===
African bovids continued becoming more adapted to mixed feeding, indicated by dental mesowear evidence, as their palaeoenvironment opened up.

==Characteristics==

All bovids have the similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, one or more pairs of horns (generally present on males) immediately after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.

The bovids show great variation in size: the gaur can weigh more than , and stand high at the shoulder. The royal antelope, in sharp contrast, is only tall and weighs at most . The klipspringer, another small antelope, stands at the shoulder and weighs just .

Differences occur in pelage colouration, ranging from a pale white (as in the Arabian oryx) to black (as in the black wildebeest). However, only the intermediate shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.
Some species, such as the gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant&#x27;s gazelle, are camouflaged with strongly disruptive facial markings that conceal the highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example &quot;Bos&quot;, &quot;Ovis&quot;, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.

Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have horns, and in many species, females, too, possess horns. The size and shape of the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.

Male horn development has been linked to sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as non-territorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.

===Anatomy===

In bovids, the third and fourth metapodials are combined into the cannon bone. The ulna and fibula are reduced, and fused with the radius and tibia, respectively. Long scapulae are present, whereas the clavicles are absent. Being ruminants, the stomach is composed of four chambers: the rumen (80%), the omasum, the reticulum, and the abomasum. The ciliates and bacteria of the rumen ferment the complex cellulose into simpler fatty acids, which are then absorbed through the rumen wall. Bovids have a long small intestine; the length of the small intestine in cattle is . Body temperature fluctuates through the day; for instance, in goats the temperature can change slightly from nearly in the early morning to in the afternoon. Temperature is regulated through sweating in cattle, whereas goats use panting for the same. The right lung, consisting of four to five lobes, is around 1.5 times larger than the left, which has three lobes.

===Dentition===
Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth. While the upper incisors are absent, the upper canines are either reduced or absent. Instead of the upper incisors, bovids have a thick and tough layer of tissue, called the dental pad, that provides a surface to grip grasses and foliage. They are hypsodont and selenodont, since the molars and premolars are low-crowned and crescent-shaped cusps. The lower incisors and canines project forward. The incisors are followed by a long toothless gap, known as the diastema. The general dental formula for bovids is . Most members of the family are herbivorous, but most duikers are omnivorous. Like other ruminants, bovids have four-chambered stomachs, which allow them to digest plant material, such as grass, that cannot be used by many other animals. Ruminants (and some others like kangaroos, rabbits, and termites) are able to use micro-organisms living in their guts to break down cellulose by fermentation.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The bovids have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each be divided into territorial and non-territorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which other members of the species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.

Excluding the cephalophines (duikers), tragelaphines (spiral-horned antelopes) and the neotragines, most African bovids are gregarious and territorial. Males are forced to disperse on attaining sexual maturity, and must form their own territories, while females are not required to do so. Males that do not hold territories form bachelor herds. Competition takes place among males to acquire dominance, and fights tend to be more rigorous in limited rutting seasons. With the exception of migratory males, males generally hold the same territory throughout their lives. In the waterbuck, some male individuals, known as &quot;satellite males&quot;, may be allowed into the territories of other males and have to wait till the owner grows old so they may acquire his territory. Lek mating, where males gather together and competitively display to potential mates, is known to exist among topis, kobs, and lechwes. The tragelaphines, cattle, sheep, and goats are gregarious and not territorial. In these species, males must gain absolute dominance over all other males, and fights are not confined to territories. Males, therefore, spend years in body growth.

===Activity===

Most bovids are diurnal, although a few such as the buffalo, bushbuck, reedbuck, and grysbok are exceptions. Social activity and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. The bovids usually rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. Grooming is usually by licking with the tongue. Rarely do antelopes roll in mud or dust. Wildebeest and buffalo usually wallow in mud, whereas the hartebeest and topi rub their heads and horns in mud and then smear it over their bodies. Bovids use different forms of vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. These involve varied postures of neck, head, horns, hair, legs, and ears to convey sexual excitement, emotional state, or alarm. One such expression is the flehmen response. Bovids usually stand motionless, with the head high and an intent stare, when they sense danger. Some like the impala, kudu, and eland can even leap to heights of a few feet. Bovids may roar or grunt to caution others and warn off predators. Bovids such as gazelles stot or pronk in response to predators, making high leaps on stiff legs, indicating honestly both that the predator has been seen, and that the stotting individual is strong and not worth chasing.

In the mating season, rutting males bellow to make their presence known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.

Fighting techniques differ amongst the bovid families and also depend on their build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds. As a rule, only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent&#x27;s head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.

===Diet===

Most bovids alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrate feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small species such as the duiker browse for a few hours during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.
Subfamilies exhibit different feeding strategies. While Bovinae species graze extensively on fresh grass and diffused forage, Cephalophinae species (with the exception of &quot;Sylvicapra&quot;) primarily consume fruits. Reduncinae and Hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources, but the latter are specially adapted to arid areas. Members of Caprinae, being flexible feeders, forage even in areas with low productivity. Tribes Alcelaphini, Hippotragini, and Reduncini have high proportions of monocots in their diets. On the contrary, Tragelaphini and Neotragini (with the exception of &quot;Ourebia&quot;) feed extensively on dicots. No conspicuous relationship exists between body size and consumption of monocots.

===Sexuality and reproduction===

Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, individuals are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be slightly larger than males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This is the case in duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance, the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.

All bovids mate at least once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur typically during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundings, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except for the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.

Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker gestation ranges from 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), and it is able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, but that is not the case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species, the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for the defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).

===Lifespan===
Most wild bovids live for 10 to 15 years. Larger species tend to live longer; for instance, American bison can live up to 25 years and gaur up to 30 years. The mean lifespan of domesticated individuals is nearly ten years. For example, domesticated goats have an average lifespan of 12 years.
Usually males, mainly in polygynous species, have shorter lifespans than females. This can be attributed to several reasons: early dispersal of young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence.
==Distribution==
Most of the diverse bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum concentration is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.

==Interaction with humans==
===Domesticated animals===

The domestication of bovids has contributed to shifting the dependence of human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The Bovidae includes three domesticated species whose use has spread around the world: cattle, sheep, and goats; all are from Eurasia. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which have less ubiquitous distributions include the domestic buffalo (from the wild water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng). Some antelopes have been domesticated including the oryxes, addax, elands and the extinct bubal hartebeest. In Ancient Egypt oryxes, addaxes and bubal hartebeests are depicted in carved walls.

The earliest evidence of cattle domestication is from 8000 BC, suggesting that the process began in Cyprus and the Euphrates basin.

===Animal products===

Dairy products such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used in some parts of the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and &quot;gulab jamun&quot; dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.
Beef is a food source high in zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins. Bison meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, but has a higher protein content.

Bovid leather is tough and durable, with the additional advantage that it can be made into leathers of varying thicknesses - from soft clothing leather to hard shoe leather. While goat and cattle leather have a wide variety of use, sheepskin is suited only for clothing purposes. Wool from Merino hoggets is the finest and most valuable. Merino wool is long and very soft. Coarse wools, being durable and resistant to pilling, are used for making tough garments and carpets.

Bone meal is an important fertilizer rich in calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, effective in removing soil acidity. Bovid horns have been used as drinking vessels since antiquity.

===In human culture=== 
Bovidae have featured in stories since at least the time of Aesop&#x27;s fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include &quot;The Crow and the Sheep&quot;, &quot;The Frog and the Ox&quot;, and &quot;The Wolf and the Lamb&quot;. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake&#x27;s head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.

<text>Avadis &quot;Avie&quot; Tevanian (born 1961) is an American software engineer. At Carnegie Mellon University, he was a principal designer and engineer of the Mach operating system (also known as the Mach Kernel). He used that work at NeXT Inc. as the foundation of the NeXTSTEP operating system. He was senior vice president of software engineering at Apple from 1997 to 2003, and then chief software technology officer from 2003 to 2006. There, he redesigned NeXTSTEP to become macOS. Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS both incorporate the Mach Kernel, and iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS are all derived from iOS. He was a longtime friend of Steve Jobs.

==Early life==
Tevanian is from Westbrook, Maine. He is of Armenian descent. Tevanian cloned the 1980s arcade game &quot;Missile Command&quot;, giving it the same name in a version for the Xerox Alto, and &quot;Mac Missiles!&quot; for the Macintosh platform. He has a B.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Rochester and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. There, he was a principal designer and engineer of the Mach operating system, along with Richard Rashid.

==Career==
===NeXT Inc.===
He was Vice President of Software Engineering at NeXT Inc. and was responsible for managing NeXT&#x27;s software engineering department. There, he designed the NeXTSTEP operating system, based upon his previous academic work on Mach.

===Apple Inc.===
He was senior vice president of software engineering at Apple from 1997 to 2003, and then chief software technology officer from 2003 to 2006. There, he redesigned NeXTSTEP to become macOS, which became iOS.

In &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot; in 2001, he was a witness for the United States Department of Justice, testifying against Microsoft.

In 2001, Bertrand Serlet and Tevanian initiated a secret project at the request of Steve Jobs, to sell MacOS on Vaio laptops. Apple demonstrated the product to Sony executives at a golf party in Hawaii, with the most expensive Vaio they could acquire. Sony refused, arguing Vaio&#x27;s sales had just started to grow after years of difficulties.

===Theranos and Dolby Labs===
Tevanian left Apple on March 31, 2006, and joined the boards of both Dolby Labs and Theranos, Inc. He resigned from the board of Theranos in late 2007, with an acrimonious ending as he faced legal threats and was forced to waive his right to buy a company cofounder&#x27;s shares, actions he believed were in retaliation for the skepticism he was often alone in expressing about the company&#x27;s finances and progress in developing its technology at board meetings.

In May 2006, he joined the board of Tellme Networks, which was later sold to Microsoft. On January 12, 2010, he became managing director of Elevation Partners. In July 2015, he cofounded NextEquity Partners and as of 2017 is serving as Managing Director.

<text>The &quot;National Anthem of the Republic of China&quot;, also known by its incipit &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot;, is the national anthem of the Republic of China, commonly called Taiwan, as well as the party anthem of the Kuomintang. It was adopted in 1930 as the national anthem and was used as such in mainland China until 1949, when the Republic of China central government relocated to Taiwan following its defeat by the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War. It replaced the &quot;Song to the Auspicious Cloud&quot;, which had been used as the Chinese national anthem before. The national anthem was adopted in Taiwan on October 25, 1945 after the surrender of Imperial Japan. Mainland China, being governed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China today, discontinued this national anthem for &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;.

The national anthem&#x27;s words are adapted from a 1924 speech by Sun Yat-sen in 1927. The lyrics relate to how the vision and hopes of a new nation and its people can be achieved and maintained. Informally, the song is sometimes known as &quot;San Min Chu-i&quot; from its opening line, which references the Three Principles of the People (), but this name is never used on formal or official occasions. During flag-raising ceremonies, the national anthem is played at the start prior to flag-raising followed by the National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China during actual flag-raising.

== History ==
The text was a collaboration between several Kuomintang (KMT) party members: Hu Hanmin, Tai Chi-tao, Liao Zhongkai, and Shao Yuanchong. The text debuted on 16 June 1924, as the opening of a speech by Sun Yat-sen at the opening ceremony of the Whampoa Military Academy. After the success of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang party chose the text to be its party anthem and publicly solicited for accompanying music. Cheng Maoyun won in a contest of 139 participants.

On 24 March 1930, numerous Kuomintang party members proposed to use the speech by Sun as the lyrics to the national anthem. At the time, the national anthem of the republic was the &quot;Song to the Auspicious Cloud&quot;. Due to opposition over using a symbol of a political party to represent the entire nation, the National Anthem Editing and Research Committee () was set up, which endorsed the KMT party song. On 3 June 1937, the Central Standing Committee () approved the proposal, and in the 1940s, the song formally became the official national anthem of the Republic of China. For many Taiwanese, the anthem carries a number of meanings, often conflicting. Some Taiwanese reject the anthem outright as an anachronistic symbol of the vanquished KMT dictatorship.

&lt;/score&gt;

== Lyrics ==


The lyrics are in classical literary Chinese. For example:
* () is a literary equivalent of both singular and plural &quot;you&quot; (which are differentiated in modern Chinese) depending on the context. In this case, it is the plural of &quot;you&quot;.
* () is a classical synonym of &quot;not&quot; ( fēi).
* () is a classical, archaic interjection, and is not used in this sense in the modern vernacular language.
In this respect, the national anthem of the Republic of China stands in contrast to the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, which was written a few years later entirely in modern vernacular Chinese.

As well as being written in classical Chinese, the national anthem follows classical poetic conventions. The ancient &quot;Fu&quot; style follows that of a four-character poem, where the last character of each line rhymes in or , which are equivalent.

<text>In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called Lobachevskian geometry or [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]]–[[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevskian]] geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry. The parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with:
:For any given line &quot;R&quot; and point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;R&quot;, in the plane containing both line &quot;R&quot; and point &quot;P&quot; there are at least two distinct lines through &quot;P&quot; that do not intersect &quot;R&quot;.
(Compare the above with Playfair&#x27;s axiom, the modern version of Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate.)

The hyperbolic plane is a plane where every point is a saddle point. 
Hyperbolic plane geometry is also the geometry of pseudospherical surfaces, surfaces with a constant negative Gaussian curvature. Saddle surfaces have negative Gaussian curvature in at least some regions, where they locally resemble the hyperbolic plane.

The hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry provides a representation of events one temporal unit into the future in Minkowski space, the basis of special relativity. Each of these events corresponds to a rapidity in some direction.

When geometers first realised they were working with something other than the standard Euclidean geometry, they described their geometry under many different names; Felix Klein finally gave the subject the name hyperbolic geometry to include it in the now rarely used sequence elliptic geometry (spherical geometry), parabolic geometry (Euclidean geometry), and hyperbolic geometry.
In the former Soviet Union, it is commonly called Lobachevskian geometry, named after one of its discoverers, the Russian geometer Nikolai Lobachevsky.

==Properties==

===Relation to Euclidean geometry===

Hyperbolic geometry is more closely related to Euclidean geometry than it seems: the only axiomatic difference is the parallel postulate.
When the parallel postulate is removed from Euclidean geometry the resulting geometry is absolute geometry.
There are two kinds of absolute geometry, Euclidean and hyperbolic.
All theorems of absolute geometry, including the first 28 propositions of book one of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, are valid in Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry.
Propositions 27 and 28 of Book One of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; prove the existence of parallel/non-intersecting lines.

This difference also has many consequences: concepts that are equivalent in Euclidean geometry are not equivalent in hyperbolic geometry; new concepts need to be introduced.
Further, because of the angle of parallelism, hyperbolic geometry has an absolute scale, a relation between distance and angle measurements.

===Lines===
Single lines in hyperbolic geometry have exactly the same properties as single straight lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, two points uniquely define a line, and line segments can be infinitely extended.

Two intersecting lines have the same properties as two intersecting lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, two distinct lines can intersect in no more than one point, intersecting lines form equal opposite angles, and adjacent angles of intersecting lines are supplementary.

When a third line is introduced, then there can be properties of intersecting lines that differ from intersecting lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, given two intersecting lines there are infinitely many lines that do not intersect either of the given lines.

These properties are all independent of the model used, even if the lines may look radically different.

====Non-intersecting / parallel lines====
Non-intersecting lines in hyperbolic geometry also have properties that differ from non-intersecting lines in Euclidean geometry:

:For any line &quot;R&quot; and any point &quot;P&quot; which does not lie on &quot;R&quot;, in the plane containing line &quot;R&quot; and point &quot;P&quot; there are at least two distinct lines through &quot;P&quot; that do not intersect &quot;R&quot;.

This implies that there are through &quot;P&quot; an infinite number of coplanar lines that do not intersect &quot;R&quot;.

These non-intersecting lines are divided into two classes:
* Two of the lines (&quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the diagram) are limiting parallels (sometimes called critically parallel, horoparallel or just parallel): there is one in the direction of each of the ideal points at the &quot;ends&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, asymptotically approaching &quot;R&quot;, always getting closer to &quot;R&quot;, but never meeting it.
* All other non-intersecting lines have a point of minimum distance and diverge from both sides of that point, and are called &quot;ultraparallel&quot;, &quot;diverging parallel&quot; or sometimes &quot;non-intersecting.&quot;
Some geometers simply use the phrase &quot;&quot;parallel&quot; lines&quot; to mean &quot;&quot;limiting parallel&quot; lines&quot;, with &quot;ultraparallel&quot; lines meaning just &quot;non-intersecting&quot;.

These limiting parallels make an angle &quot;θ&quot; with &quot;PB&quot;; this angle depends only on the Gaussian curvature of the plane and the distance &quot;PB&quot; and is called the angle of parallelism.

For ultraparallel lines, the ultraparallel theorem states that there is a unique line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each pair of ultraparallel lines.

=== Circles and disks ===

In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference of a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; is greater than formula_1.

Let formula_2, where formula_3 is the Gaussian curvature of the plane. In hyperbolic geometry, formula_4 is negative, so the square root is of a positive number.

Then the circumference of a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; is equal to:

:formula_5

And the area of the enclosed disk is:

:formula_6

Therefore, in hyperbolic geometry the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius is always strictly greater than formula_7, though it can be made arbitrarily close by selecting a small enough circle.

If the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1 then the geodesic curvature of a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; is: formula_8

=== Hypercycles and horocycles ===

In hyperbolic geometry, there is no line whose points are all equidistant from another line. Instead, the points that are all the same distance from a given line lie on a curve called a hypercycle.

Another special curve is the horocycle, whose normal radii (perpendicular lines) are all limiting parallel to each other (all converge asymptotically in one direction to the same ideal point, the centre of the horocycle).

Through every pair of points there are two horocycles. The centres of the horocycles are the ideal points of the perpendicular bisector of the line-segment between them.

Given any three distinct points, they all lie on either a line, hypercycle, horocycle, or circle.

The length of a line-segment is the shortest length between two points.

The arc-length of a hypercycle connecting two points is longer than that of the line segment and shorter than that of the arc horocycle, connecting the same two points.

The lengths of the arcs of both horocycles connecting two points are equal, and are longer than the arclength of any hypercycle connecting the points and shorter than the arc of any circle connecting the two points.

If the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1, then the geodesic curvature of a horocycle is 1 and that of a hypercycle is between 0 and 1.

=== Triangles ===
Unlike Euclidean triangles, where the angles always add up to π radians (180°, a straight angle), in hyperbolic space the sum of the angles of a triangle is always strictly less than π radians (180°). The difference is called the defect. Generally, the defect of a convex hyperbolic polygon with formula_9 sides is its angle sum subtracted from formula_10. 

The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by its defect in radians multiplied by &quot;R&quot;, which is also true for all convex hyperbolic polygons. Therefore all hyperbolic triangles have an area less than or equal to &quot;R&quot;π. The area of a hyperbolic ideal triangle in which all three angles are 0° is equal to this maximum.

As in Euclidean geometry, each hyperbolic triangle has an incircle. In hyperbolic space, if all three of its vertices lie on a horocycle or hypercycle, then the triangle has no circumscribed circle.

As in spherical and elliptical geometry, in hyperbolic geometry if two triangles are similar, they must be congruent.

===Regular apeirogon and pseudogon===

Special polygons in hyperbolic geometry are the regular apeirogon and pseudogon uniform polygons with an infinite number of sides.

In Euclidean geometry, the only way to construct such a polygon is to make the side lengths tend to zero and the apeirogon is indistinguishable from a circle, or make the interior angles tend to 180° and the apeirogon approaches a straight line.

However, in hyperbolic geometry, a regular apeirogon or pseudogon has sides of any length (i.e., it remains a polygon with noticeable sides).

The side and angle bisectors will, depending on the side length and the angle between the sides, be limiting or diverging parallel. If the bisectors are limiting parallel then it is an apeirogon and can be inscribed and circumscribed by concentric horocycles.

If the bisectors are diverging parallel then it is a pseudogon and can be inscribed and circumscribed by hypercycles (all vertices are the same distance of a line, the axis, also the midpoint of the side segments are all equidistant to the same axis).

=== Tessellations ===


Like the Euclidean plane it is also possible to tessellate the hyperbolic plane with regular polygons as faces.

There are an infinite number of uniform tilings based on the Schwarz triangles (&quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot;) where 1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot; + 1/&quot;r&quot; &lt; 1, where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; are each orders of reflection symmetry at three points of the fundamental domain triangle, the symmetry group is a hyperbolic triangle group. There are also infinitely many uniform tilings that cannot be generated from Schwarz triangles, some for example requiring quadrilaterals as fundamental domains.

== Standardized Gaussian curvature ==

Though hyperbolic geometry applies for any surface with a constant negative Gaussian curvature, it is usual to assume a scale in which the curvature &quot;K&quot; is −1.

This results in some formulas becoming simpler. Some examples are:
* The area of a triangle is equal to its angle defect in radians.
* The area of a horocyclic sector is equal to the length of its horocyclic arc.
* An arc of a horocycle so that a line that is tangent at one endpoint is limiting parallel to the radius through the other endpoint has a length of 1.
* The ratio of the arc lengths between two radii of two concentric horocycles where the horocycles are a distance 1 apart is &quot;e&quot; :1.

===Cartesian-like coordinate systems===


Compared to Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry presents many difficulties for a coordinate system: the angle sum of a quadrilateral is always less than 360°; there are no equidistant lines, so a proper rectangle would need to be enclosed by two lines and two hypercycles; parallel-transporting a line segment around a quadrilateral causes it to rotate when it returns to the origin; etc.

There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based around choosing a point (the origin) on a chosen directed line (the &quot;x&quot;-axis) and after that many choices exist.

The Lobachevsky coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are found by dropping a perpendicular onto the &quot;x&quot;-axis. &quot;x&quot; will be the label of the foot of the perpendicular. &quot;y&quot; will be the distance along the perpendicular of the given point from its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other).

Another coordinate system measures the distance from the point to the horocycle through the origin centered around formula_11 and the length along this horocycle.

Other coordinate systems use the Klein model or the Poincaré disk model described below, and take the Euclidean coordinates as hyperbolic.

=== Distance ===
A Cartesian-like coordinate system (&quot;x, y&quot;) on the oriented hyperbolic plane is constructed as follows. Choose a line in the hyperbolic plane together with an orientation and an origin &quot;o&quot; on this line. Then:
*the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of a point is the signed distance of its projection onto the line (the foot of the perpendicular segment to the line from that point) to the origin; 
*the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate is the signed distance from the point to the line, with the sign according to whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the oriented line. 

The distance between two points represented by (&quot;x_i, y_i&quot;), &quot;i=1,2&quot; in this coordinate system is
formula_12

This formula can be derived from the formulas about hyperbolic triangles.

The corresponding metric tensor field is: formula_13.

In this coordinate system, straight lines take one of these forms ((&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a point on the line; &quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;0, &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;α&quot; are parameters):

ultraparallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis
:formula_14
asymptotically parallel on the negative side
:formula_15
asymptotically parallel on the positive side
:formula_16
intersecting perpendicularly
:formula_17
intersecting at an angle &quot;α&quot;
:formula_18
Generally, these equations will only hold in a bounded domain (of &quot;x&quot; values). At the edge of that domain, the value of &quot;y&quot; blows up to ±infinity.

== History ==

Since the publication of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; circa 300BC, many geometers tried to prove the parallel postulate. Some tried to prove it by assuming its negation and trying to derive a contradiction. Foremost among these were Proclus, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen), Omar Khayyám, Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī, Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, and later Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, John Wallis, Johann Heinrich Lambert, and Legendre.
Their attempts were doomed to failure (as we now know, the parallel postulate is not provable from the other postulates), but their efforts led to the discovery of hyperbolic geometry.

The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam and al-Tūsī on quadrilaterals, including the Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral and Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral, were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri.

In the 18th century, Johann Heinrich Lambert introduced the hyperbolic functions and computed the area of a hyperbolic triangle.

===19th-century developments===

In the 19th century, hyperbolic geometry was explored extensively by Nikolai Lobachevsky, János Bolyai, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Franz Taurinus. Unlike their predecessors, who just wanted to eliminate the parallel postulate from the axioms of Euclidean geometry, these authors realized they had discovered a new geometry.

Gauss wrote in an 1824 letter to Franz Taurinus that he had constructed it, but Gauss did not publish his work. Gauss called it &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot; causing several modern authors to continue to consider &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot; and &quot;hyperbolic geometry&quot; to be synonyms. Taurinus published results on hyperbolic trigonometry in 1826, argued that hyperbolic geometry is self-consistent, but still believed in the special role of Euclidean geometry. The complete system of hyperbolic geometry was published by Lobachevsky in 1829/1830, while Bolyai discovered it independently and published in 1832.

In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami provided models of hyperbolic geometry, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if and only if Euclidean geometry was.

The term &quot;hyperbolic geometry&quot; was introduced by Felix Klein in 1871. Klein followed an initiative of Arthur Cayley to use the transformations of projective geometry to produce isometries. The idea used a conic section or quadric to define a region, and used cross ratio to define a metric. The projective transformations that leave the conic section or quadric stable are the isometries. &quot;Klein showed that if the Cayley absolute is a real curve then the part of the projective plane in its interior is isometric to the hyperbolic plane...&quot;

=== Philosophical consequences ===

The discovery of hyperbolic geometry had important philosophical consequences. Before its discovery many philosophers (such as Hobbes and Spinoza) viewed philosophical rigor in terms of the &quot;geometrical method&quot;, referring to the method of reasoning used in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

Kant in &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; concluded that space (in Euclidean geometry) and time are not discovered by humans as objective features of the world, but are part of an unavoidable systematic framework for organizing our experiences.

It is said that Gauss did not publish anything about hyperbolic geometry out of fear of the &quot;uproar of the Boeotians&quot; (stereotyped as dullards by the ancient Athenians), which would ruin his status as &quot;princeps mathematicorum&quot; (Latin, &quot;the Prince of Mathematicians&quot;).
The &quot;uproar of the Boeotians&quot; came and went, and gave an impetus to great improvements in mathematical rigour, analytical philosophy and logic. Hyperbolic geometry was finally proved consistent and is therefore another valid geometry.

=== Geometry of the universe (spatial dimensions only) ===

Because Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry are all consistent, the question arises: which is the real geometry of space, and if it is hyperbolic or elliptic, what is its curvature?

Lobachevsky had already tried to measure the curvature of the universe by measuring the parallax of Sirius and treating Sirius as the ideal point of an angle of parallelism. He realized that his measurements were not precise enough to give a definite answer, but he did reach the conclusion that if the geometry of the universe is hyperbolic, then the absolute length is at least one million times the diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit (, 10 parsec).
Some argue that his measurements were methodologically flawed.

Henri Poincaré, with his sphere-world thought experiment, came to the conclusion that everyday experience does not necessarily rule out other geometries.

The geometrization conjecture gives a complete list of eight possibilities for the fundamental geometry of our space. The problem in determining which one applies is that, to reach a definitive answer, we need to be able to look at extremely large shapes – much larger than anything on Earth or perhaps even in our galaxy.

=== Geometry of the universe (special relativity) ===
Special relativity places space and time on equal footing, so that one considers the geometry of a unified spacetime instead of considering space and time separately. Minkowski geometry replaces Galilean geometry (which is the 3-dimensional Euclidean space with time of Galilean relativity).

In relativity, rather than Euclidean, elliptic and hyperbolic geometry, the appropriate geometries to consider are Minkowski space, de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space, corresponding to zero, positive and negative curvature respectively.

Hyperbolic geometry enters special relativity through rapidity, which stands in for velocity, and is expressed by a hyperbolic angle. The study of this velocity geometry has been called kinematic geometry. The space of relativistic velocities has a three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, where the distance function is determined from the relative velocities of &quot;nearby&quot; points (velocities).

== Physical realizations of the hyperbolic plane ==

There exist various pseudospheres in Euclidean space that have a finite area of constant negative Gaussian curvature.

By Hilbert&#x27;s theorem, one cannot isometrically immerse a complete hyperbolic plane (a complete regular surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature) in a 3-D Euclidean space.

Other useful models of hyperbolic geometry exist in Euclidean space, in which the metric is not preserved. A particularly well-known paper model based on the pseudosphere is due to William Thurston.

The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes, the first such demonstration having been made by Daina Taimiņa.

In 2000, Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick-to-make paper model dubbed the &quot;hyperbolic soccerball&quot; (more precisely, a truncated order-7 triangular tiling).

Instructions on how to make a hyperbolic quilt, designed by Helaman Ferguson, have been made available by Jeff Weeks.

== Models of the hyperbolic plane ==
Various pseudospheres – surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature – can be embedded in 3-D space under the standard Euclidean metric, and so can be made into tangible models. Of these, the tractoid (or pseudosphere) is the best known; using the tractoid as a model of the hyperbolic plane is analogous to using a cone or cylinder as a model of the Euclidean plane. However, the entire hyperbolic plane cannot be embedded into Euclidean space in this way, and various other models are more convenient for abstractly exploring hyperbolic geometry.

There are four models commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the Klein model, the Poincaré disk model, the Poincaré half-plane model, and the Lorentz or hyperboloid model. These models define a hyperbolic plane which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry. Despite their names, the first three mentioned above were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincaré or Klein. All these models are extendable to more dimensions.

===The Beltrami–Klein model===
The Beltrami–Klein model, also known as the projective disk model, Klein disk model and Klein model, is named after Eugenio Beltrami and Felix Klein.

For the two dimensions this model uses the interior of the unit circle for the complete hyperbolic plane, and the chords of this circle are the hyperbolic lines.

For higher dimensions this model uses the interior of the unit ball, and the chords of this &quot;n&quot;-ball are the hyperbolic lines.
* This model has the advantage that lines are straight, but the disadvantage that angles are distorted (the mapping is not conformal), and also circles are not represented as circles.
* The distance in this model is half the logarithm of the cross-ratio, which was introduced by Arthur Cayley in projective geometry.

=== The Poincaré disk model ===

The Poincaré disk model, also known as the conformal disk model, also employs the interior of the unit circle, but lines are represented by arcs of circles that are orthogonal to the boundary circle, plus diameters of the boundary circle.
* This model preserves angles, and is thereby conformal. All isometries within this model are therefore Möbius transformations.
* Circles entirely within the disk remain circles although the Euclidean center of the circle is closer to the center of the disk than is the hyperbolic center of the circle.
* Horocycles are circles within the disk which are tangent to the boundary circle, minus the point of contact.
* Hypercycles are open-ended chords and circular arcs within the disc that terminate on the boundary circle at non-orthogonal angles.

=== The Poincaré half-plane model ===

The Poincaré half-plane model takes one-half of the Euclidean plane, bounded by a line &quot;B&quot; of the plane, to be a model of the hyperbolic plane. The line &quot;B&quot; is not included in the model.

The Euclidean plane may be taken to be a plane with the Cartesian coordinate system and the x-axis is taken as line &quot;B&quot; and the half plane is the upper half (&quot;y&quot; &gt; 0 ) of this plane.
* Hyperbolic lines are then either half-circles orthogonal to &quot;B&quot; or rays perpendicular to &quot;B&quot;.
* The length of an interval on a ray is given by logarithmic measure so it is invariant under a homothetic transformation formula_19
* Like the Poincaré disk model, this model preserves angles, and is thus conformal. All isometries within this model are therefore Möbius transformations of the plane.
* The half-plane model is the limit of the Poincaré disk model whose boundary is tangent to &quot;B&quot; at the same point while the radius of the disk model goes to infinity.

=== The hyperboloid model ===
The hyperboloid model or Lorentz model employs a 2-dimensional hyperboloid of revolution (of two sheets, but using one) embedded in 3-dimensional Minkowski space. This model is generally credited to Poincaré, but Reynolds says that Wilhelm Killing used this model in 1885
* This model has direct application to special relativity, as Minkowski 3-space is a model for spacetime, suppressing one spatial dimension. One can take the hyperboloid to represent the events (positions in spacetime) that various inertially moving observers, starting from a common event, will reach in a fixed proper time.
* The hyperbolic distance between two points on the hyperboloid can then be identified with the relative rapidity between the two corresponding observers.
* The model generalizes directly to an additional dimension: a hyperbolic 3-space three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry relates to Minkowski 4-space.

=== The hemisphere model ===

The hemisphere model is not often used as model by itself, but it functions as a useful tool for visualizing transformations between the other models.

The hemisphere model uses the upper half of the unit sphere:
formula_20

The hyperbolic lines are half-circles orthogonal to the boundary of the hemisphere.

The hemisphere model is part of a Riemann sphere, and different projections give different models of the hyperbolic plane:
* Stereographic projection from formula_21 onto the plane formula_22 projects corresponding points on the Poincaré disk model
* Stereographic projection from formula_21 onto the surface formula_24 projects corresponding points on the hyperboloid model
* Stereographic projection from formula_25 onto the plane formula_26 projects corresponding points on the Poincaré half-plane model
* Orthographic projection onto a plane formula_27 projects corresponding points on the Beltrami–Klein model.
* Central projection from the centre of the sphere onto the plane formula_28 projects corresponding points on the Gans Model

===Connection between the models===
All models essentially describe the same structure. The difference between them is that they represent different coordinate charts laid down on the same metric space, namely the hyperbolic plane. The characteristic feature of the hyperbolic plane itself is that it has a constant negative Gaussian curvature, which is indifferent to the coordinate chart used. The geodesics are similarly invariant: that is, geodesics map to geodesics under coordinate transformation. Hyperbolic geometry is generally introduced in terms of the geodesics and their intersections on the hyperbolic plane.

Once we choose a coordinate chart (one of the &quot;models&quot;), we can always embed it in a Euclidean space of same dimension, but the embedding is clearly not isometric (since the curvature of Euclidean space is 0). The hyperbolic space can be represented by infinitely many different charts; but the embeddings in Euclidean space due to these four specific charts show some interesting characteristics.

Since the four models describe the same metric space, each can be transformed into the other.

See, for example:
* the Beltrami–Klein model&#x27;s relation to the hyperboloid model,
* the Beltrami–Klein model&#x27;s relation to the Poincaré disk model,
* and the Poincaré disk model&#x27;s relation to the hyperboloid model.

=== Other models of hyperbolic geometry ===

==== The Gans model ====
In 1966 David Gans proposed a flattened hyperboloid model in the journal &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;. It is an orthographic projection of the hyperboloid model onto the xy-plane.
This model is not as widely used as other models but nevertheless is quite useful in the understanding of hyperbolic geometry.
* Unlike the Klein or the Poincaré models, this model utilizes the entire Euclidean plane.
* The lines in this model are represented as branches of a hyperbola.

==== The conformal square model ====
The conformal square model of the hyperbolic plane arises from using Schwarz-Christoffel mapping to convert the Poincaré disk into a square. This model has finite extent, like the Poincaré disk. However, all of the points are inside a square. This model is conformal, which makes it suitable for artistic applications. 

==== The band model ====

The band model employs a portion of the Euclidean plane between two parallel lines. Distance is preserved along one line through the middle of the band. Assuming the band is given by formula_29, the metric is given by formula_30.

== Isometries of the hyperbolic plane ==
Every isometry (transformation or motion) of the hyperbolic plane to itself can be realized as the composition of at most three reflections. In &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperbolic space, up to &quot;n&quot;+1 reflections might be required. (These are also true for Euclidean and spherical geometries, but the classification below is different.)

All isometries of the hyperbolic plane can be classified into these classes:
* Orientation preserving
** the identity isometry — nothing moves; zero reflections; zero degrees of freedom.
** inversion through a point (half turn) — two reflections through mutually perpendicular lines passing through the given point, i.e. a rotation of 180 degrees around the point; two degrees of freedom.
** rotation around a normal point — two reflections through lines passing through the given point (includes inversion as a special case); points move on circles around the center; three degrees of freedom.
** &quot;rotation&quot; around an ideal point (horolation) — two reflections through lines leading to the ideal point; points move along horocycles centered on the ideal point; two degrees of freedom.
** translation along a straight line — two reflections through lines perpendicular to the given line; points off the given line move along hypercycles; three degrees of freedom.
* Orientation reversing
** reflection through a line — one reflection; two degrees of freedom.
** combined reflection through a line and translation along the same line — the reflection and translation commute; three reflections required; three degrees of freedom.

== Hyperbolic geometry in art ==

M. C. Escher&#x27;s famous prints &quot;Circle Limit III&quot; and &quot;Circle Limit IV&quot;
illustrate the conformal disc model (Poincaré disk model) quite well. The white lines in &quot;III&quot; are not quite geodesics (they are hypercycles), but are close to them. It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.

For example, in &quot;Circle Limit III&quot; every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this, we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is exponential growth. In &quot;Circle Limit III&quot;, for example, one can see that the number of fishes within a distance of &quot;n&quot; from the center rises exponentially. The fishes have an equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius &quot;n&quot; must rise exponentially in &quot;n&quot;.

The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes (pictured above) with the first being made by Daina Taimiņa, whose book &quot;Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes&quot; won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.

HyperRogue is a roguelike game set on various tilings of the hyperbolic plane.

==Higher dimensions==
Hyperbolic geometry is not limited to 2 dimensions; a hyperbolic geometry exists for every higher number of dimensions.

==Homogeneous structure==
Hyperbolic space of dimension &quot;n&quot; is a special case of a Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type, as it is isomorphic to the quotient
:: formula_31
The orthogonal group acts by norm-preserving transformations on Minkowski space R1,&quot;n&quot;, and it acts transitively on the two-sheet hyperboloid of norm 1 vectors. Timelike lines (i.e., those with positive-norm tangents) through the origin pass through antipodal points in the hyperboloid, so the space of such lines yields a model of hyperbolic &quot;n&quot;-space. The stabilizer of any particular line is isomorphic to the product of the orthogonal groups O(&quot;n&quot;) and O(1), where O(&quot;n&quot;) acts on the tangent space of a point in the hyperboloid, and O(1) reflects the line through the origin. Many of the elementary concepts in hyperbolic geometry can be described in linear algebraic terms: geodesic paths are described by intersections with planes through the origin, dihedral angles between hyperplanes can be described by inner products of normal vectors, and hyperbolic reflection groups can be given explicit matrix realizations.

In small dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms of Lie groups that yield additional ways to consider symmetries of hyperbolic spaces. For example, in dimension 2, the isomorphisms allow one to interpret the upper half plane model as the quotient and the Poincaré disc model as the quotient . In both cases, the symmetry groups act by fractional linear transformations, since both groups are the orientation-preserving stabilizers in of the respective subspaces of the Riemann sphere. The Cayley transformation not only takes one model of the hyperbolic plane to the other, but realizes the isomorphism of symmetry groups as conjugation in a larger group. In dimension 3, the fractional linear action of on the Riemann sphere is identified with the action on the conformal boundary of hyperbolic 3-space induced by the isomorphism . This allows one to study isometries of hyperbolic 3-space by considering spectral properties of representative complex matrices. For example, parabolic transformations are conjugate to rigid translations in the upper half-space model, and they are exactly those transformations that can be represented by unipotent upper triangular matrices.

<text>The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus), also known as the lizard shark, is one of the two extant species of shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae (the other is the southern African frilled shark, &quot;Chlamydoselachus africana&quot;). The frilled shark is considered a living fossil, because of its primitive, anguilliform (eel-like) physical traits, such as a dark-brown color, amphistyly (the articulation of the jaws to the cranium), and a –long body, which has dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins located towards the tail. The common name, &quot;frilled shark&quot;, derives from the fringed appearance of the six pairs of gill slits at the shark&#x27;s throat.

The two species of frilled shark are distributed throughout regions of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, usually in the waters of the outer continental shelf and of the upper continental slope, where the sharks usually live near the ocean floor, near biologically productive areas of the ecosystem. To live on a diet of cephalopods, smaller sharks, and bony fish, the frilled shark practices diel vertical migration to feed at night at the surface of the ocean. When hunting food, the frilled shark curls its tail against a rock and moves like an eel, bending and lunging to capture and swallow whole prey with its long and flexible jaws, which are equipped with 300 recurved, needle-like teeth.

Reproductively, the two species of frilled shark, &quot;C. anguineus&quot; and &quot;C. africana&quot;, are aplacental viviparous animals, born of an egg, without a placenta to the mother shark. Contained within egg capsules, the shark embryos develop in the body of the mother shark; at birth, the infant sharks emerge from their egg capsules in the uterus, where they feed on yolk. Although it has no distinct breeding season, the gestation period of the frilled shark can be up to 3.5 years long, to produce a litter of 2–15 shark pups. Usually caught as bycatch in commercial fishing, the frilled shark has some economic value as a meat and as fishmeal; and has been caught from depths of , although its occurrence is uncommon below ; whereas in Suruga Bay, Japan, the frilled shark commonly occurs at depths of .

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The zoologist Ludwig Döderlein first identified, described, and classified the frilled shark as a discrete species of shark. After three years (1879–1881) of marine research in Japan, Döderlein took two specimen sharks to Vienna, but lost the taxonomic manuscript of the research. Three years later, in the &quot;Bulletin of the Essex Institute&quot; (vol. XVI, 1884) the zoologist Samuel Garman published the first taxonomy of the frilled shark, based upon his observations, measurements, and descriptions of a –long female shark from Sagami Bay, Japan. In the article &quot;An Extraordinary Shark&quot; Garman classified the new species of shark within its own genus and family, and named it &quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot; (eel-like shark with frills). The Graeco–Latin nomenclature of the frilled shark derives from the Greek &quot;chlamy&quot; (frill) and &quot;selachus&quot; (shark), and the Latin &quot;anguineus&quot; (like an eel); besides its common name, the frilled shark also is known as the &quot;lizard shark&quot; and as the &quot;scaffold shark&quot;.
The frilled-shark is considered a &quot;living fossil&quot;, because its family lineage dates to the Carboniferous period. Initially, marine scientists considered the frilled shark a living, evolutionary representative of extinct groups of elasmobranchs (rays, sharks, skates, sawfish), because the shark&#x27;s body featured primitive anatomic traits, such as long jaws with trident-shaped, multi-cusp teeth; &quot;amphistyly&quot;, the direct articulation of the jaws to the cranium, at a point behind the eyes; and a quasi-cartilaginous notochord (a proto-spinal-column) composed of indistinct vertebrae. From that anatomy, Garman proposed that the frilled shark was related to the cladodont sharks of the &quot;Cladoselache&quot; genus that existed during the Devonian period (419–359 mya) in the Palaeozoic era (541–251 mya). In contrast to Garman&#x27;s thesis, the ichthyologist Theodore Gill and the paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, suggested that the frilled shark&#x27;s evolutionary tree indicated relation to the Hybodontiformes (hybodonts), which were the dominant species of shark during the Mesozoic era (252–66 mya); and Cope categorized the &quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot; species to the fossil genus &quot;Xenacanthus&quot; that existed from the late Devonian period to the end of the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era.

The anatomic traits of body, muscle, and skeleton phylogenically include the frilled shark to the neoselachian clade (modern sharks and rays) which relates it to the cow shark, in the order &quot;Hexanchiformes&quot;. In addition, a genetic analysis conducted by researchers in 2016 may also suggest that the species is part of the order &quot;Hexanchiformes&quot;. Nonetheless, the systematic biologist Shigeru Shirai proposed the &quot;Chlamydoselachiformes&quot; taxonomic order exclusively for the &quot;C. anguinesis&quot; and the &quot;C. africana&quot; species of frilled sharks. As a marine animal, the frilled shark is a living fossil because of its relatively unchanged anatomy and physique, since first appearing in the primeval seas of the Late Cretaceous (c. 95 mya) and the Late Jurassic (150 mya) epochs. In evolutionary terms, the frilled shark is an animal species of recent occurrence in the natural history of the Earth; the earliest discoveries of the fossilized teeth of the &quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot; species of shark date to the early Pleistocene epoch (2.58–0.0117 mya). In 2009, marine biologists identified, described, and classified the &quot;Chlamydoselachus africana&quot; (southern African frilled shark) of the Atlantic waters of southern Angola and of southern Namibia as a species of frilled shark different from the &quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot; identified in 1884.

==Habitat and distribution==
The habitats of the frilled shark include the waters of the outer continental shelf and the upper-to-middle continental slope, favoring upwellings and other biologically productive areas. Usually, the shiver lives close to the ocean floor, yet its diet of cephalopods, smaller sharks, and bony fish, indicates that the frilled shark practices diel vertical migration, and swims up to feed at night at the surface of the ocean. In their Atlantic- and Pacific-ocean habitats, frilled sharks practice spatial segregation determined by the individual size, the sex, and the reproductive condition of each shark in the shiver. In Suruga Bay, on the Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan, the frilled shark is most common at the depth of , except in the August-to-November period, when the temperature at the water-layer exceeds , and then the sharks swim into deeper, cooler water.

In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the frilled shark occurs off northern Norway, northern Scotland, and western Ireland, ranging from France to Morocco, the archipelago of Madeira, and the coast of Mauritania, in northwest Africa. In the central Atlantic Ocean, the frilled shark has been caught along the region of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, ranging from north of the Azores islands to the Rio Grande Rise, off southern Brazil, and the Vavilov Ridge, off West Africa. Frilled sharks tend to be very solitary organisms; interacting with multiple individuals of their kind is rare. However, in the late 2000s a large capture was made over an underwater seamount of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, hauling in over 30 frilled sharks. The mass capture of a wide variety of male and female specimens emphasized these seamounts as a location for the mating of the species. In the western Atlantic, the frilled shark occurs in the waters of New England and Georgia, in the US, and in the waters of Suriname, in the northeastern coast of South America.

In the western Pacific Ocean, the frilled shark ranges from southeastern Honshu, Japan, north to Taiwan, off the coast of China, to the coast of New South Wales, Australia, and the islands of Tasmania and New Zealand. In the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, the frilled shark occurs in the regional waters of Hawaii and the coast of California, in the US, and the northern coast of Chile, in western South America. Although it has been caught at the depth of , the frilled shark usually does not occur deeper than .

==Description==
The eel-like bodies of &quot;C. anguineus&quot; and &quot;C. africana&quot; differ anatomically; &quot;C. anguineus&quot; has a longer head and shorter gill slits, a spinal column with more vertebrae (160–171 vs. 147), and a lower-intestine spiral valve with more turns (35–49 vs. 26–28) than does &quot;C. africana&quot;. The skin color of either species ranges from uniformly dark-brown to uniformly grey. In addition, &quot;C. anguineus&quot; has smaller pectoral fins than &quot;C. africana&quot;, and the mouth is narrower. The recorded, maximum body-length of a male frilled shark is , and the recorded, maximum body-length of a female frilled shark is .

The head of the frilled shark is broad and flat, with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils are vertical slits, separated by a flap of skin that forms the incurrent opening and the excurrent opening. The moderately large eyes are horizontal ellipsoids, which have no nictitating membrane, which is a protective, third-eyelid. Ligaments articulate the long jaws to the cranium, and the corners of the mouth have neither furrows nor folds. The jaws contain 300 trident-shaped teeth, each needle-tooth has a cusp and two cusplets; the rows of teeth are widely spaced, with 19–28 tooth rows in the upper jaw, and 21–29 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Frilled sharks are able to open jaws and devour food sources that are considerably greater than that of their size, this is a physical trait that is present in gulper eels and viperfish. At the throat, there are six pairs of long gill slits; the first pair of gill slits form a collar, while the extended tips of the gill filaments create a fleshy frill, hence, the &quot;frilled shark&quot; name of this fish.

The pectoral fins are short and rounded; the single, small dorsal fin has a rounded margin, and is positioned at the far end of the body, approximately opposite the anal fin. The pelvic and the anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and are positioned to the tail-end of the frilled shark&#x27;s body. The very long caudal fin is a triangular tail that has neither a lower lobe nor a ventral notch in the upper lobe, and has a margin equipped with sharp, chisel-shaped dermal denticles, which the shark can enlarge. The underside of the shark&#x27;s eel-like body features a pair of long, thick folds of skin, separated by a groove, which run the length of the belly; the function of the ventral skin-folds is unknown. In the female frilled shark, the mid-section is of the body longer, with the pelvic fins located closer to the anal fin.

==Biology and ecology==
A cartilaginous skeleton and a large liver (filled with low-density lipids) are the mechanical means with which the frilled shark controls and maintains its buoyancy in the deep waters of the ocean. The shark has an open, lateral-line organ system featuring mechanoreceptor hair cells in grooves exposed to the ocean environment; such a basal clade configuration enhances the frilled shark&#x27;s perception and detection of changes in the movement, the vibration, and the pressure of the surrounding water. Like all animals, the frilled shark is afflicted by parasites, such as the &quot;Monorygma&quot; tapeworm, the trematoda flatworm, the &quot;Otodistomum veliporum&quot;, and the &quot;Mooleptus rabuka&quot; nematode; and by predators, such as other sharks, as indicated by missing tail-tips lost to a hungry attacker.

In New Zealand, the Takatika Grit, in the Chatham Islands, yielded frilled-shark, bird, and conifer-cone fossils that dated to the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (66.043 ± 0.011 mya) which suggested that the sharks lived inland, in shallow bodies of water far from the ocean. The shallow-water frilled shark had larger, stronger teeth, suitable for eating mollusks; scarcity and plenty of food are indicated in the tooth&#x27;s morphology of sharper points (cusps) oriented into the mouth. From the Late Paleocene epoch (66–56 mya) until the contemporary era, other species of sharks out-matched the &quot;Chlamydoselachus&quot; sharks in competition for feeding grounds and living space, which restricted their geographic distribution to the deep-water ocean. Regarding the frilled shark&#x27;s survival of the mass-extinction event which occurred at the Cretaceous–Paleogene time-boundary, one hypothesis proposes that the sharks survived in bodies of shallow water, both inland and on the continental shelf; afterwards, the frilled shark migrated to deep-water habitats.

===Diet===
The frilled shark eats a diet of cephalopods, Nudibranchs, smaller sharks, and bony fish; 60 percent of the diet is composed of squid varieties, such as the &quot;Chiroteuthis&quot;, the &quot;Histioteuthis&quot;, and the &quot;Onychoteuthis&quot;, the &quot;Sthenoteuthis&quot; and the &quot;Todarodes&quot;; and other sharks, as indicated by the stomach contents of a –long frilled shark which had swallowed a Japanese catshark (&quot;Apristurus japonicus&quot;). The high tendency to primarily consume the squids in their habitat can be supported by the frequent observation of beak remnants left behind during digestive processes. Because frilled sharks live on the ocean floor, they may also feed on carrion floating down from the surface.

In hunting and eating prey that are tired or exhausted or dying (after spawn), the frilled shark&#x27;s physiology suggests that it may curve its anguilline body, and brace its rear fins against the water, for leverage to effect a rapid-strike bite that captures the prey. The wide gape of the distended, long jaws allows devouring whole prey that are more than half the size of the frilled shark, itself. The jaws&#x27; 300 recurved teeth (19–28 upper rows and 21–29 lower rows) readily snag and capture the soft body and tentacles of a cephalopod, especially with the rows of trident-shaped teeth are rotated outwards, when the jaws are open and protruded. Moreover, unlike the strong bite of sharks with an underslung jaw attached below the cranium, the frilled shark has a relatively weak bite, because of the limited leverage and force possible with long jaws that are directly articulated to the cranium, at a point behind the eyes.

The behavior of captive specimen sharks suggests that the frilled shark also hunts with its mouth open, by using the dark-and-light contrast of white teeth and darkness to lure prey into its gaping maw; and also hunts with negative pressure, to suck prey into its maw. Forensic examination of frilled sharks&#x27; revealed little-to-no food in their stomachs, which suggests that the frilled shark either has a fast-rate of digestion or goes hungry in the long intervals between feedings.

===Reproduction===
The extant species of frilled shark, &quot;C. anguineus&quot; and &quot;C. africana&quot;, do not have a defined breeding season, because their oceanic habitats register no seasonal influence from the ocean&#x27;s surface; the male shark reaches sexual maturity when he is long, and the female shark reaches sexual maturity when she is long. The mature female shark has two ovaries and a uterus, which is in the right side of her body; ovulation occurs fortnightly; and pregnancy ceases vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the production of new ova. Both ovulated eggs and early-stage shark embryos are enclosed in chondrichthyes, ellipsoid egg-cases made of a thin, golden-brown membrane.

Reproductively, the frilled shark is an ovoviviparous animal born from an encapsulated egg retained within the mother shark&#x27;s uterus. During gestation, the shark embryos develop in membranous egg-cases contained within the body of the mother shark, when the infant sharks emerge from their egg capsules in the uterus they feed on yolk until birth. The frilled-shark embryo is long, has a pointed head, slightly developed jaws, nascent external gills, and possesses all fins. The growth of the jaw for elasmobranchs seem to begin early in the embryonic stage, however, it has been observed not to be the case for frilled sharks. The elongation of the jaws seemed to begin later in embryonic development. This leads to some studies suggesting that the terminal position of their mouth, due to anterior elongation of the jaw, is a derived trait instead of ancestral. When the embryo is long, the mother shark expels the egg capsule, at which developmental stage the frilled shark&#x27;s external gills are developed. Throughout embryonic development, the size of the yolk sac remains constant, until the shark embryo is long, whereupon the sac shrinks until disappearing when the embryo has grown to in length. In the course of pregnancy, the embryo&#x27;s average rate-of-growth is per month until birth, when the shark pups are long, therefore, the frilled shark&#x27;s gestation period can be as long as 3.5 years; at birth, a frilled shark&#x27;s litter comprises 2–15 pups, with an average litter comprises 6.0 pups.

==Human interactions==
In pursuit of food, the frilled shark usually is a bycatch of commercial fishing, accidentally caught in the nets used for trawl-, gillnet-, and longline-fishing. In Japan, at Suruga Bay, the frilled shark is usually caught in the gillnets used to catch sea bream and gnomefish, and in the trawl nets used to catch shrimp in the mid-waters of the ocean. Despite being a nuisance fish that damages fishing nets, the economic and commercial value of the frilled shark is as fishmeal and as meat.

In 2004, marine biologists first observed the frilled shark (&quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot;) at the depth of , in its deep-water habitat at the Blake Plateau, off the southeastern coast of the U.S. In 2007, a Japanese fisherman caught a –long female frilled shark at the surface of the ocean and delivered it to the Awashima Marine Park, at Shizuoka city, where the shark died after hours of captivity. In 2014, a trawler fishing-boat caught a –long frilled shark in –deep water at Lakes Entrance, Victoria, Australia; later, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) confirmed that the shark was a &quot;Chlamydoselachus anguineus&quot;, an eel-like shark with a frill.

In 2016, consequent to the depletion of food sources caused by commercial overfishing of the feeding areas of the shark&#x27;s deep-water habitat, and because of the shark&#x27;s slow rate of reproduction, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified the frilled shark as a fish species under near-threat of extinction, and then reclassified it as a species of Least Concern of extinction. In 2018, the New Zealand Threat Classification System identified the frilled shark as an animal &quot;At Risk — Naturally Uncommon&quot;, not easily found living in the wild.

<doc id="241296" wikidata="Q16386522" url="?curid=241296" title="Kant and the Platypus">
<text>Kant and the Platypus: Essays on Language and Cognition () is a book by Umberto Eco which was published in Italian as &quot;Kant e l&#x27;ornitorinco&quot; in 1997. An English edition, translated by Alastair McEwen, appeared in 1999.

The book develops some aspects of Eco&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Semiotics&quot; which came out in 1976.

In the first chapter Eco argues against Nietzsche&#x27;s assertion that the truth is a poetically elaborated &quot;mobile army of metaphors, metonymies and anthropomorphisms&quot; that subsequently get into knowledge, &quot;illusions whose illusory nature has been forgotten&quot;.

In chapter two, working with ideas derived from Charles Sanders Peirce and Immanuel Kant, Eco compares linguistic and perceptual meaning when confronted with the unencountered.

Chapter three explores the Aztec encounter with the horse in terms of Cognitive Type, the private mechanism that allows identification of an object, and of Nuclear Content, which clarifies the relevant features inter-subjectively. To this is added Molar Content, which provides a much broader range of knowledge, even if restricted to specific competences. From these he develops an understanding of social elements in the organisation of knowledge.

In chapter four he discusses the different ordering of knowledge with a dictionary and an encyclopedia - that is, the differences between categorical knowledge and knowledge by properties. Using the example of the arrival of the first platypus in Europe, Eco looks at the problem faced by scientists in their attempts to classify the creature for eighty years, and at the contractual nature of the negotiations that produce shared meaning.

In chapter five Eco discusses the Sarkiiapone, an animal whose sole nature is that it is fictive. He then discusses how the meaning of a term is affected by the context, using examples to tease out different meanings.

Chapter six deals with iconism and hypoicon. Eco compares and contrasts &quot;likeness&quot; and &quot;similarity&quot; in relation to perception and conception. To this end he addresses basic semiotic processes that take place within perception and provide determinations from which cognitive types can be constructed, with all the cultural baggage that is involved.

<text>The Winter Triangle is an astronomical asterism formed from three of the brightest stars in the winter sky. It is an imaginary isosceles triangle drawn on the celestial sphere, with its defining vertices at Sirius, Betelgeuse, and Procyon, the primary stars in the three constellations of Canis Major, Orion, and Canis Minor, respectively.

==Visibility==

For much of the night in the northern winter, the Winter Triangle is high in the sky at mid-northern latitudes, but can also be seen during autumn in the early morning to the East. In the spring the winter triangle is visible early in the evening to the West before its stars set below the horizon. From the southern hemisphere it appears upside down and lower in the sky during the summer months.

The Winter Triangle surrounds most of the faint constellation Monoceros, although its brightest stars are of fourth magnitude and hardly noticeable to the naked eye. The triangle includes two first magnitude stars, while Sirius is even brighter. The other bright stars of the winter sky lie around the triangle: Orion including Rigel; Aldebaran in Taurus; Castor and Pollux in Gemini; and Capella in Auriga.

<doc id="241300" wikidata="Q350472" url="?curid=241300" title="Eddie Cantor">
<text>Eddie Cantor (born Isidore Itzkowitz; January 31, 1892 – October 10, 1964) was an American comedian, actor, dancer, singer, songwriter, film producer, screenwriter and author. Cantor was one of the prominent entertainers of his era.

Some of his hits include &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;, &quot;Ida (Sweet as Apple Cider)&quot;, &quot;If You Knew Susie&quot;, &quot;Ma! He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me&quot;, “Mandy”, &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me”, &quot;Margie&quot;, and &quot;How Ya Gonna Keep &#x27;em Down on the Farm (After They&#x27;ve Seen Paree)?&quot; He also wrote a few songs, including &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; Warner Bros. cartoon theme.

His eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot;. In 1933, artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor&#x27;s eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; (1941).

He helped to develop the March of Dimes and is credited with coining its name. Cantor was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1956 for distinguished service to the film industry.

==Early life==
Reports and accounts of Cantor&#x27;s early life often conflict with one another. He was born in New York City, the son of Mechel (a.k.a. Michael) Iskowitz, an amateur violinist; and his wife (a.k.a. Maite) Meta Kantrowitz Iskowitz, a young Jewish couple from Russia. It is generally accepted that he was born in 1892, though the day is subject to debate, with either January 31 or Rosh Hashanah, which was on September 10 or September 11, being reported. Although it was reported Cantor was an orphan, his mother dying in childbirth and his father of pneumonia, official records say otherwise; Meta died from complications of tuberculosis in July 1894, and the fate of Mechel is unclear, as no death certificate exists for him. There is also discrepancy as to his name; both his 1957 autobiography and &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary for Cantor report his birth name as Isidore Iskowitch, although some articles published after the 20th century give his birth name as Edward (a nickname given him by his future wife, Ida, in 1913) or Israel Itzkowitz. His grandmother, Esther Kantrowitz (died January 29, 1917), took custody of him, and referred to him as Izzy and Itchik (both diminutives for Isidor), and his last name, due to a clerical error, was thought to be Kantrowitz and shortened to Kanter. No birth certificate existed for him, though this is not unusual for someone born in New York in the 19th century.

==Stage==

===Saloon songs to vaudeville===
By his early teens, Cantor began winning talent contests at local theaters and started appearing on stage. One of his earliest paying jobs was doubling as a waiter and performer, singing for tips at Carey Walsh&#x27;s Coney Island saloon, where a young Jimmy Durante accompanied him on piano. He made his first public appearance in Vaudeville in 1907 at New York&#x27;s Clinton Music Hall. In 1912, he was the only performer over the age of 20 to appear in Gus Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Kid Kabaret&quot;, where he created his first blackface character &quot;Jefferson&quot;. He later toured with Al Lee as the team Cantor and Lee. Critical praise from that show got the attention of Broadway&#x27;s top producer Florenz Ziegfeld, who gave Cantor a spot in the Ziegfeld rooftop post-show, &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot; (1917).

===Broadway===
A year later, Cantor made his Broadway debut in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1917&quot;. He continued in the &quot;Follies&quot; until 1927, a period considered the best years of the long-running revue. For several years, Cantor co-starred in an act with pioneer comedian Bert Williams, both appearing in blackface; Cantor played Williams&#x27;s fresh-talking son. Other co-stars with Cantor during his time in the &quot;Follies&quot; included Will Rogers, Marilyn Miller, Fanny Brice, and W.C. Fields. He moved on to stardom in book musicals, starting with &quot;Kid Boots&quot; (1923) and &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1928). The successful Broadway run of &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; was cut short when Cantor suffered a major heart attack, the first of several that would plague his later years.

==Radio and recordings==

===Radio===
Cantor appeared on radio as early as February 3, 1922, as indicated by this news item from Connecticut&#x27;s &quot;Bridgeport Telegram&quot;:
Cantor&#x27;s appearance with Rudy Vallee on Vallee&#x27;s &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; on February 5, 1931, led to a four-week tryout with &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;. Replacing Maurice Chevalier, who was returning to Paris, Cantor joined &quot;Chase and Sanborn&quot; on September 13, 1931. This hour-long Sunday evening variety series teamed Cantor with announcer Jimmy Wallington and violinist Dave Rubinoff. The show established Cantor as a leading comedian, and his scriptwriter, David Freedman, as &quot;the Captain of Comedy&quot;. Freedman&#x27;s team included, among others, Samuel &quot;Doc&quot; Kurtzman, who also wrote for song-and-dance man, Al Jolson, and the comedian Jack Benny. Cantor soon became the world&#x27;s highest-paid radio star. His shows began with a crowd chanting &quot;We want Can-tor! We want Can-tor!&quot;, a phrase said to have originated in vaudeville, when the audience chanted to chase off an act on the bill before Cantor. Cantor&#x27;s theme song was his own lyric to the Leo Robin/Richard Whiting song, &quot;One Hour with You&quot;. His radio sidekicks included Bert Gordon, (comic Barney Gorodetsky, AKA The Mad Russian) and Harry Parke (better known as Parkyakarkus). Cantor also discovered and helped guide the career of singer Dinah Shore, first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, as well as other performers, including Deanna Durbin, Bobby Breen in 1936, and Eddie Fisher in 1949.

Indicative of his effect on the mass audience, he agreed in November 1934 to introduce a new song by the songwriters J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie that other well-known artists had rejected as being &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;childish&quot;. The song, &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, immediately had orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music the next day. It sold 400,000 copies by Christmas of that year.

His NBC radio show &quot;Time to Smile&quot; was broadcast from 1940 to 1946, followed by his &quot;Pabst Blue Ribbon Show&quot; from 1946 through 1949. The Pabst program ended when the sponsor wanted Cantor to add a weekly television program. Cantor refused to take on the additional broadcast. The trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Cantor and Pabst &quot;parted friends&quot; after &quot;several months of negotiation.&quot; He also served as emcee of &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; during 1949–1950, and hosted a weekly disc jockey program for Philip Morris during the 1952–1953 season. In addition to film and radio, Cantor recorded for Hit of the Week Records, then again for Columbia, for Banner and Decca and various small labels.

In the early 1960s, he syndicated the short radio segment &quot;Ask Eddie Cantor&quot;.

His heavy political involvement began early in his career, including his participation in the strike to form Actors Equity in 1919, provoking the anger of father figure and producer, Florenz Ziegfeld. At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Cantor publicly denounced antisemitic radio personality Father Charles Coughlin and then was dropped by his radio sponsor Camel cigarettes. A year and a half later, Cantor was able to return to the air because of help from his friend Jack Benny.

===Recordings===
Cantor began making phonograph records in 1917, recording both comedy songs and routines and popular songs of the day, first for Victor, then for Aeoleon-Vocalion, Pathé, and Emerson. From 1921 through 1925, he had an exclusive contract with Columbia Records, returning to Victor for the remainder of the decade.

Cantor was one of the era&#x27;s most successful entertainers, but the 1929 stock market crash took away his multimillionaire status and left him deeply in debt. However, Cantor&#x27;s relentless attention to his own earnings to avoid the poverty he knew growing up caused him to use his writing talent, quickly building a new bank account with his highly popular, bestselling books of humor and cartoons about his experience, &quot;Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street&quot; in 1929 &quot;A.C.&quot; (After Crash), and &quot;Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!&quot;

Cantor was also a composer, with his most famous song seldom attributed to him. In 1935, along with Charles Tobias (Ida&#x27;s brother) and Murray Mencher, Cantor wrote &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;. It was adapted as the theme song for the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of animated cartoons, distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures between 1936 and 1964. Cantor himself was frequently caricatured in Warner cartoons of the period, (see Film and television: Animation).

==Film and television==
Cantor also made numerous film appearances. He had previously appeared in a number of short films, performing his &quot;Follies&quot; songs and comedy routines, and two silent features (&quot;Special Delivery&quot; and &quot;Kid Boots&quot;) in the 1920s. He was offered the lead in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; after it was turned down by George Jessel. Cantor also turned the role down (so it went to Al Jolson), but he became a leading Hollywood star in 1930 with the film version of &quot;Whoopee!,&quot; shot in two-color Technicolor. He continued making films over the next two decades until his last starring role in &quot;If You Knew Susie&quot; (1948). 

On May 25, 1944, pioneer television station WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia presented a special, all-star telecast which was also seen in New York over WNBT (now WNBC) and featured cut-ins from their Rockefeller Center studios. Cantor, one of the first major stars to agree to appear on television, was to sing &quot;We&#x27;re Havin&#x27; a Baby, My Baby and Me&quot;. Arriving shortly before airtime at the New York studios, Cantor was reportedly told to cut the song because the NBC New York censors considered some of the lyrics too risqué. Cantor refused, claiming no time to prepare an alternative number. NBC relented, but the sound was cut and the picture blurred on certain lines in the song. This is considered the first instance of television censorship.
From 1950 to 1954, Cantor was a regular guest host on the television variety series &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. In 1950, he became the first of several hosts alternating on the NBC television variety show &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, in which he would introduce musical acts, stage and film stars and play comic characters such as &quot;Maxie the Taxi&quot;. In the spring of 1952, Cantor landed in an unlikely controversy when a young Sammy Davis Jr., appeared as a guest performer. Cantor embraced Davis and mopped Davis&#x27;s brow with his handkerchief after his performance. When worried sponsors led NBC to threaten cancellation of the show, Cantor&#x27;s response was to book Davis for two more weeks. Cantor suffered a heart attack following a September 1952 Colgate broadcast, and thereafter, curtailed his appearances until his final program in 1954. In 1955, he appeared in a filmed series for syndication and a year later, appeared in two dramatic roles (&quot;George Has A Birthday&quot;, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; broadcast in color, and &quot;Size.man and Son&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;). He continued to appear as a guest on several shows, and was last seen on the NBC color broadcast of &quot;The Future Lies Ahead&quot; on January 22, 1960, which also featured Mort Sahl.

===Animation===
Cantor appears in caricature form in numerous &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons produced for Warner Bros., although he was often voiced by an imitator. Beginning with &quot;I Like Mountain Music&quot; (1933), other animated Cantor cameos include &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot; (Harman-Ising, 1933) and &quot;Billboard Frolics&quot; (Friz Freleng, 1935). Eddie Cantor is one of the four &quot;down on their luck&quot; stars (along with Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, and Jack Benny) snubbed by Elmer Fudd in &quot;What’s Up, Doc?&quot; (Bob McKimson, 1950). In &quot;Farm Frolics&quot; (Bob Clampett, 1941), a horse, asked by the narrator to &quot;do a canter&quot;, promptly launches into a singing, dancing, eye-rolling impression. The Cantor gag that got the most mileage, however, was his oft-repeated wish for a son after five famous daughters. &quot;Slap-Happy Pappy&quot; (Clampett, 1940) features an &quot;Eddie Cackler&quot; rooster that wants a boy, to little avail. Other references can be found in &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot; (Clampett, 1946) and &quot;Circus Today&quot; (Tex Avery, 1940). In &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, &quot;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&quot; Cantor&#x27;s many daughters are referenced by a group of singing quintuplet girls. In &quot;Porky’s Naughty Nephew&quot; (Clampett, 1938) a swimming Cantor gleefully adopts a &quot;buoy&quot;. An animated Cantor also appears prominently in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; (Wilfred Jackson, 1938) as Little Jack Horner, who sings &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;.

==Books and merchandising==

Cantor&#x27;s popularity led to merchandising of such products as &quot;Eddie Cantor&#x27;s Tell It to the Judge&quot; game from Parker Brothers. In 1933, Brown and Bigelow published a set of 12 Eddie Cantor caricatures by Frederick J. Garner. The advertising cards were purchased in bulk as a direct-mail item by such businesses as auto body shops, funeral directors, dental laboratories, and vegetable wholesale dealers. With the full set, companies could mail a single Cantor card each month for a year to their selected special customers as an ongoing promotion. Cantor was often caricatured on the covers of sheet music and in magazines and newspapers. Cantor was depicted as a balloon in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, one of the very few balloons based on a real person.

In addition to &quot;Caught Short!&quot;, Cantor wrote or co-wrote at least seven other books, including booklets released by the then-fledgling firm of Simon &amp; Schuster, with Cantor&#x27;s name on the cover. (Some were &quot;as told to&quot; or written with David Freedman.) Customers paid a dollar and received the booklet with a penny embedded in the hardcover. They sold well, and H.L. Mencken asserted that the books did more to pull America out of the Great Depression than all government measures combined.

== Activism and philanthropy ==
Cantor was the second president of the Screen Actors Guild, serving from 1933 to 1935.

He invented the title &quot;The March of Dimes&quot; for the donation campaigns of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was organized to combat polio. It was a play on &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreels popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt was the most notable American victim of polio. Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the White House mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimes—a large sum at the time.

Cantor also recorded a spoken introduction on a 1938 Decca recording of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; by Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell in which he thanks the listener for buying the record, which supported the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. That record hit No. 1 on the charts, though Cantor did not sing on it. A lifelong Democrat, Cantor supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

==Tributes==
Cantor was profiled on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, a program in which an unsuspecting person (usually a celebrity) would be surprised on live television by host Ralph Edwards, with a half-hour tribute. Cantor was the only subject who was told of the &quot;surprise&quot; in advance; he was recovering from a heart attack, and it was felt that the shock might harm him.

In 1951 he received an honorary doctorate from Temple University.

There was an Eddie Cantor caricature featured in Comedy Store, and flashing lights on it marked the end of auditions for comedians. 

Warner Bros., in an attempt to duplicate the box-office success of &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;, filmed a big-budget Technicolor feature film &quot;The Eddie Cantor Story&quot; (1953). The film found an audience but might have done better with someone else in the leading role. Actor Keefe Brasselle played Cantor as a caricature with high-pressure dialogue and bulging eyes wide open; the fact that Brasselle was considerably taller than Cantor did not lend realism. Eddie and Ida Cantor were seen in a brief prologue and epilogue set in a projection room, where they are watching Brasselle in action; at the end of the film, Eddie tells Ida &quot;I never looked better in my life&quot;... and gives the audience a knowing, incredulous look. George Burns, in his memoir &quot;All My Best Friends&quot;, claimed that Warner Bros. created a miracle producing the movie in that &quot;it made Eddie Cantor&#x27;s life boring&quot;.

Probably the best summary of Cantor&#x27;s career is on one of the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; shows. Re-issued on DVD as &quot;Eddie Cantor in Person&quot;, the hour-long episode is a virtual video autobiography, with Eddie recounting his career, singing his greatest hits, and recreating his singing-waiter days with another vaudeville legend, his old pal Jimmy Durante.

Cantor appears as a recurring character, played by Stephen DeRosa, on the series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

== Personal life and family ==
Cantor adopted the first name &quot;Eddie&quot; when he met his future wife Ida Tobias in 1913, because she felt that &quot;Izzy&quot; was not the right name for an actor. Cantor and Ida (1892–1962) were married on June 6, 1914. They had five daughters – Marjorie (1915–1959), Natalie (1916–1997), Edna June (1919–2003), Marilyn (1921–2010), and Janet (1927–2018). The girls provided comic fodder for Cantor&#x27;s longtime running gag, especially on radio, about his five unmarriageable daughters. Several radio historians, including Gerald Nachman (in his book &quot;Raised on Radio&quot;), have said that this gag did not always sit well with the girls.

Natalie&#x27;s first husband was Joseph Louis Metzger, a businessman from Boston; they married in 1937. Her second husband was the French-born American actor Robert Clary, who was best known for his role as Corporal Louis LeBeau on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. Edna married James Francis McHugh Jr., in 1938. McHugh Sr. was a songwriter who was close friends with Eddie Cantor. Janet married the actor Roberto Gari. Marilyn married a Canadian, Michael Baker, in 1960. She was the only child in the family to follow her father into show business.

Following the death of their daughter Marjorie at the age of 44, Eddie&#x27;s and Ida&#x27;s health declined rapidly. She had been her father&#x27;s secretary and a magazine writer. Ida died on August 9, 1962, at age 70 of &quot;cardiac insufficiency&quot;, and Eddie died on October 10, 1964, in Beverly Hills, California, after suffering his second heart attack at age 72. He is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Culver City, California.

Cantor was a Freemason via Munn Lodge No. 190 in New York City.

<text>Im Kwon-taek (; born December 8, 1934) is one of South Korea&#x27;s most renowned film directors. In an active and prolific career, his films have won many domestic and international film festival awards, as well as considerable box-office success, and helped bring international attention to the Korean film industry. As of spring 2015, he has directed 102 films.

==Early life==
Im Kwon-taek was born in Jangseong, Zenranan Prefecture, Korea, Empire of Japan, and grew up in Gwangju. After the Korean War, he moved to Busan in search of work. He then moved to Seoul in 1956, where Jeong Chang-hwa, director of &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; (1972), offered him room and board for work as a production assistant. Jeong recommended him for directing in 1961.

==Career==
Im&#x27;s directorial premiere was with the 1962 film, &quot;Farewell to the Duman River&quot; (&quot;Dumanganga jal itgeola&quot;).

Before 1980, he was known primarily as a commercial filmmaker who could efficiently direct as many as eight genre pictures a year, helping to fulfill the quota for domestic pictures set by the government . His desire to make more artistically satisfying films began to show itself with his 1978 film &quot;Jokbo&quot; (&quot;Genealogy&quot; or &quot;The Family Tree&quot;), but the turning point of his career came with the 1981 film &quot;Mandala&quot;. From this point his films have been regarded as art-house cinema, and have been regularly shown at international film festivals, and have won numerous awards.

Im has continued to explore themes from Korea&#x27;s past while also focusing on the Korean cultural identity in modern times. Among Im&#x27;s most notable recent films are &quot;Sopyonje&quot; (1993) and &quot;Chunhyang&quot; (2000), both of which concentrate on the traditional Korean musical art of pansori. The latter film was also based on a traditional Korean legend. Apart from being a critical success, &quot;Sopyonje&quot; was also a success at the box office, becoming the first domestic film to draw over a million viewers in Seoul alone. &quot;Chihwaseon&quot; (2002) was also a critical success, earning him Korea&#x27;s first Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. Im Kwon-taek was awarded an Honorary Golden Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 2005.

Im Kwon-taek&#x27;s status, brought on by the critical success of his films, overlapped with a period of the film movement called &quot;New Korean Cinema&quot; or &quot;Korean New Wave&quot;. Along with other directors, such as Park Gwang-su and Jang Sun-woo, Im is recognized as one of the founding figures of the movement, which gained international critical recognition and acclaim for Korean Cinema.

In April 2007, Im released his 100th film &quot;Beyond the Years&quot;, an informal sequel to &quot;Sopyonje&quot;. In November 2007 the French government announced that it would make Im a knight of the French Legion of Honor.

In 2013, a museum dedicated to Im opened in Busan, on the Dongseo University Centum City Campus.

A documentary on Im, &quot;Cloud, Encore&quot; (2018) by well-known film critic-turned-director Jung Sung-il, made its world premiere at the 23rd Busan International Film Festival in 2018.

==Personal life==
He married the actress (), who appeared in several of his films. Their two sons Im Dong-joon and Im Dong-jae ( Kwon Hyun-sang) are also active in the film industry.

<text>Chemnitzer Land is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the district of Mittweida, the city of Chemnitz, the districts of Stollberg and Zwickauer Land and the state of Thuringia (district Altenburger Land).

== History ==
The history of the region is largely influenced by the neighbouring cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau. In medieval times the town of Glauchau, today the capital of the district, was the centre of the county of Schönburg-Glauchau. The East German government attempted to turn the region into a huge industrial complex, which is the reason for the dense population.

The district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Glauchau and Hohenstein-Ernstthal. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Zwickauer Land, Chemnitzer Land and the urban district Zwickau were merged into the new district Zwickau.

== Geography ==
Once a densely forested region, Chemnitzer Land now is a highly urbanised region with few green areas left. The Zwickauer Mulde river runs through the northernmost part of the district.

<text>Rat snakes are members – along with kingsnakes, milk snakes, vine snakes and indigo snakes – of the subfamily Colubrinae of the family Colubridae. They are medium to large constrictors and are found throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere. They feed primarily on rodents. Many species make attractive and docile pets and one, the corn snake, is one of the most popular reptile pets in the world. Like all snakes, they can be defensive when approached too closely, handled, or restrained. However, rat snake bites are not dangerous to humans. Like nearly all colubrids, rat snakes pose no threat to humans. Rat snakes were long believed to be completely nonvenomous, but recent studies have shown that some Old World species do possess small amounts of venom, though the amount is negligible relative to humans.

Previously, most rat snakes were assigned to the genus &quot;Elaphe&quot;, but many have been since renamed following mitochondrial DNA analysis performed in 2002. For the purpose of this article, names will be harmonized with the TIGR Database.

== Taxonomy ==
In recent years, some taxonomic controversy has occurred over the genus of North American rat snakes. Based on mitochondrial DNA, Utiger et al. (2002) showed that North American rat snakes of the genus &quot;Elaphe&quot;, along with closely related genera such as &quot;Pituophis&quot; and &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;, form a monophyletic group separate from Old World members of the genus. They therefore suggested the resurrection of the available name &quot;Pantherophis&quot; Fitzinger for all North American taxa (north of Mexico). Crother et al. (2008) accepted the taxonomic change to &quot;Pantherophis&quot;.

== Venom ==
Like nearly all colubrids, rat snakes pose no threat to humans. Although rat snakes were long believed to be completely nonvenomous, recent studies have shown that some Old World species do possess small amounts of venom, though the amount is negligible relative to humans. Rat snakes usually hunt and kill mice and other small animals by grasping with their teeth to prevent escape, wrapping their body around that of the prey, and suffocating the prey by constriction.

== In captivity ==
Rat snakes are commonly kept as pets by reptile enthusiasts. The corn snake, one of the most popular pet reptiles, is a rat snake. New World species are generally thought to be more docile in captivity as opposed to Old World rat snakes, of which the opposite is assumed.

== Effects of climate change on rat snakes ==

=== Positive impacts ===
All snakes are ectotherm species, meaning they depend on the temperature of the environment to maintain homeostasis. Although it is predicted that the current rate of climate change will be too rapid for many reptiles and amphibian species to adapt or to evolve, studies have suggested that a warmer climate may actually be beneficial to rat snake species. Global warming also poses less threats to rat snakes in temperate zones than in tropical zones as rat snake species in temperate zones can tolerate broader ranges of temperature. Global climate change will increase both day and night time temperatures. This will make the night time environment more thermally suitable for rat snakes to hunt, thereby making them more active at night. Increasing night time activity allows rat snakes to catch larger prey such as birds, since female birds usually incubate their eggs in the nest at night and have decreased ability to detect rat snakes due to poor visibility conditions. Global warming may also lead to changes in predation. Rat snakes are prey species to predators like hawks. While rat snakes are being hunted during the day, being more active at night due to warmer temperatures may allow rat snakes to be less vulnerable to predation from hawks. A warming climate also enhances food digestion in rat snakes thereby making them more efficient, which enables rat snake individuals to grow larger in size and allowing them to consume more prey. In comparison to rat snake species at relatively colder regions, rat snake species at lower latitudes tend to be larger in size due to warmer climate conditions. As the global climate warms, the average body size of rat snakes at higher latitudes will become larger, which will allow the species to catch more prey and thus increase their overall reproductive success.

=== Negative impacts ===
Eastern rat snake species in North America are experiencing negative shifts in their behaviour due to Global Warming and increasing temperatures. These shifts differ between the large distribution of rat snakes that range from Ontario to Texas. The increasing Global Warming can negatively impact this species and can be responsible for population declines in some areas.

Rat snake populations from their northern range, such as Ontario, are experiencing a shift in hibernation emergence. The populations in these regions typically emerge from hibernation in late April. However, the increasing variability in temperature may cause rat snakes to emerge on a warm sunny day in the months of February or March. Climate change has caused winters that can have weather turn back very quickly from sunny periods with high temperatures to snow and below freezing temperatures. The early emergence of these rat snakes will begin to expose them to these fatal conditions if a snake cannot return to its hibernaculum in time. Therefore, the fluctuations in temperature affect the thermoregulation that rat snakes need for bodily functions like digestion and movement. The unpredictability of the weather is causing more rat snakes in their northern range to get caught in these cold snaps and freeze to death.

Increasing temperatures due to climate change have increased the nocturnal activity of rat snakes, especially in warmer climates such as Texas. This has allowed them to alter their predation habits and feed more on nesting birds and other accessible prey. However, their increased nocturnal activity puts them at risk to a new range of nocturnal predators. Rat snakes may not be used to the presence of nocturnal predators such as raccoons and owls and may be more vulnerable as prey. Until rat snakes are able to adapt to their relatively new predators, populations may be at risk due to heavy predation.

=== Life history alterations in Ontario gray rat snakes ===
As rat snakes are ectothermic species, they require sunlight and heat to maintain their body temperatures. Across their range in North America each species of rat snake has different ideal body temperatures. In Ontario, the average ideal body temperature of a rat snake is 28.1 degrees Celsius with free ranging gravid females tending to require a bit higher in order to meet their thermoregulatory requirements for gestation. With ambient air temperatures over the course of their entire active season (from May to September) almost never reaching the required 28.1 °C, rat snakes in Ontario resort to basking habitats where conditions allow temperatures to rise above normal and up to 43 degrees Celsius at the hottest times of day and year. These habitats include areas such as rock outcrops, bare ground, or edge habitat where they can bask on tree branches fully exposed to the sun. However, with climate change and an associated increase in ambient air temperature by 3 °C, the amount of required time spent by snakes in these habitats will decrease. This will result in alterations in the amount and time of activity of rat snakes in the province. They will have the potential to be generally more active during both the day and night as it will be easier for them to maintain their ideal body temperature. Habitat choices may also shift with increased temperatures. More time could be spent in areas such as forests or barns where the temperatures are currently too low for the snakes to spend most of their time. There will be less of a need to expose themselves in their open basking habitats, causing decreases in predator vulnerability as well as increases in thermoregulatory ability and foraging time. In addition, rat snakes in Ontario have a slower growth and maturation rates due to the cooler climate and shorter active seasons compared to other species of rat snakes further South in North America. This means that Ontario&#x27;s rat snakes are more vulnerable to population declines. But, with an increase in temperature and an increase in the duration of the active season from climate change, it is possible that the growth and maturation rates of these snakes will increase.

<text>Iyar (Hebrew: or , &quot;ʾĪyyar&quot; &quot;ʾĪyyār&quot;; from &quot;rosette; blossom&quot;) is the eighth month of the civil year (which starts on 1 Tishrei) and the second month of the Jewish religious year (which starts on 1 Nisan) on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin. It is a month of 29 days. Iyar usually falls in April–May on the Gregorian calendar.

In the Hebrew Bible, before the Babylonian captivity, the month was called Ziv (, , ). Ziv is a Hebrew word that means &quot;light&quot; or &quot;glow&quot;.

Along with all other current, post-biblical Jewish month names, Iyar was adopted during the Babylonian captivity. In the Babylonian calendar its name was Araḫ Āru, which can be interpreted as &quot;month of blossoming&quot;.

<doc id="241321" wikidata="Q1539513" url="?curid=241321" title="Battle of Camden">
<text>The Battle of Camden (August 16, 1780), also known as the Battle of Camden Court House, was a major victory for the British in the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War. On August 16, 1780, British forces under Lieutenant General Charles, Lord Cornwallis routed the numerically superior American forces led by Major General Horatio Gates about four miles north of Camden, South Carolina, thus strengthening the British hold on the Carolinas following the capture of Charleston.

The rout was a personally humiliating defeat for Gates, the American general best known for commanding the Patriot forces at the British defeat at Saratoga three years previously. His army had possessed a great numerical superiority over the British force, having twice the personnel, but his command of them was seen as disorganized and chaotic. Following the battle, he was regarded with disdain by his colleagues and he never held a field command again. His political connections, however, helped him avoid any military inquiry into the debacle or court martial.

==Background==
Following the British defeat at Saratoga in 1777, and the Battle of Monmouth in 1778, the French entered the American Revolutionary War in June 1778, followed by the Spanish in June 1779. With the war at a stalemate in the north, the British decided to renew their &quot;southern strategy&quot; to win back their rebellious North American colonies. The strategy relied on the Loyalists joining forces with British regulars to roll northward through North Carolina and Virginia, besieging the rebels in the north on all sides. This campaign repeated the successful December 1778 Capture of Savannah, with Sir Henry Clinton&#x27;s successful Siege of Charleston in May 1780. British forces then campaigned in the Back Country, capturing the key towns of Georgetown, Cheraw, Camden, Ninety Six, and Augusta. Clinton returned to New York on 5 June, after the southern remnants of the Continental Army were defeated in May at the Battle of Waxhaws, tasking Lord Cornwallis with the pacification of the remaining portions of the state.

The Patriot resistance remaining in South Carolina consisted of militia under commanders such as Thomas Sumter, William Davie, and Francis Marion. Washington sent Continental Army regiments south, consisting of the Maryland Line and Delaware Line, under the temporary command of Major General Jean, Baron de Kalb. Departing New Jersey on 16 April, they arrived at the Buffalo Ford on the Deep River, 30 miles south of Greensboro, in July. Horatio Gates, the &quot;Hero of Saratoga&quot; arrived in camp on 25 July, to take command. Two days later, Gates ordered his army to take the direct road to Camden, against the advice of his officers, including Otho Holland Williams. Williams noted the country they were marching through &quot;was by nature barren, abounding with sandy plains, intersected by swamps, and very thinly inhabited,&quot; and what few inhabitants they might come across were most likely hostile. All of the troops had been short of food since arrival at the Deep River.

On 7 August, Gates was joined by 2,100 North Carolina militiamen under the command of General Richard Caswell. At Rugeley&#x27;s Mill, 15 miles north of Camden, 700 Virginia Militia under the command of General Edward Stevens joined Gates&#x27; &quot;Grand Army&quot;. In addition, Gates had Armand&#x27;s Legion. However, at this stage, Gates no longer had the help of Marion&#x27;s or Sumter&#x27;s men, and in fact had sent 400 of his Continentals to help Sumter with a planned attack on a British supply convoy. Gates also refused the help of Col. William Washington&#x27;s cavalry. Apparently Gates planned on building defensive works 5.5 miles north of Camden in an effort to force British abandonment of that important town. Gates told his aide Thomas Pinckney he had no intention of attacking the British with an army consisting mostly of militia.

Camden was garrisoned by about 1,000 men under Lord Rawdon. General Cornwallis, alerted to Gates&#x27; movement on August 9, marched from Charleston with reinforcements, arriving at Camden on August 13, increasing the effective British troop strength to 2,239 men.

Gates ordered a night march to commence at 10:00 p.m. on 15th Aug., despite his army of 3,052, of which two-thirds were militia, having never maneuvered together. Unfortunately, their evening meal acted as a purgative while they marched, with Armand&#x27;s horse in the lead. On a collision course was Cornwallis&#x27; army, also on a 10:00 p.m. night march, with Tarleton&#x27;s dragoons in the lead. A short period of confusion ensued when the two forces collided around 2:00 a.m., but both sides soon separated, not wanting a night battle.

==Deployments==
Gates formed up before first light. On his right flank he placed Mordecai Gist&#x27;s 2nd Maryland Brigade (three regiments) and the Delaware Regiment, with Baron de Kalb in overall command of the right wing. On his left flank, he placed Caswell&#x27;s 1,800 North Carolina militia; to the left of them were Stevens&#x27; 700 Virginians, and behind the Virginians were 120 men of Armand&#x27;s Legion. Gates and staff stayed behind the reserve force, Smallwood&#x27;s 1st Maryland Regiment, about 200 yards behind the battle line. Thus, the total number of Continentals on the field numbered 900. Gates placed seven guns along the line, manned by about 100 men. Also present, but whose disposition was unknown, were 70 mounted volunteer South Carolinians. Gates&#x27; formation, though a typical British practice of the time, placed his weakest troops against the most experienced British regiments, while his best troops would face only the weaker elements of the British forces.

Cornwallis had roughly 2,239 men, including Loyalist militia and Volunteers of Ireland. Cornwallis also had the highly experienced Tarleton&#x27;s Legion, who were formidable in a pursuit situation. Cornwallis formed his army into two brigades. On the right was Lt. Col James Webster, facing the inexperienced militia with the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers and the 33rd Regiment of Foot. Lord Rawdon was in command of the left, facing the Continental Infantry with the Irish Volunteers, Banastre Tarleton&#x27;s infantry and the Loyalist troops. In reserve, Cornwallis had two battalions of the 71st Regiment of Foot and Tarleton&#x27;s cavalry force. He also placed four guns in the British center. As Gates had done, Cornwallis placed his more experienced units on the right flank, and his less experienced units on the left flank.

==Battle==

Gates ordered Stevens and de Kalb to attack, while Cornwallis issued the same order to Webster. The 800 strong 33rd Fusiliers advanced with bayonets towards the 2,500 soldiers in the Virginia and North Carolina militia. The militia, however, had never used bayonets before. The American left wing collapsed as the Virginians and then the North Carolinians fled. The Virginians fled so fast that they suffered only three wounded. The North Carolinians fled all the way back to Hillsborough, North Carolina.
According to Williams, referring to the British charge, &quot;the impetuosity with which they advanced, firing and huzzaing, threw the whole body of militia into such a panic that they generally threw down their loaded arms and fled in the utmost consternation. The unworthy example of the Virginians was almost instantly followed by the North Carolinians.&quot;

Furthermore, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, then governor of Virginia, &quot;picture it as bad as you possibly can and it will not be as bad as it really is.&quot;

A member of the North Carolina militia, Garret Watts, later confessed, &quot;It was instantaneous. There was no effort to rally, no encouragement to fight. Officers and men joined in the flight. I threw away my gun...&quot;

Rawdon&#x27;s troops advanced in two charges, but heavy fire repulsed his regiments. The Continental troops then launched a counterattack which came close to breaking Rawdon&#x27;s line, which began to falter. Cornwallis rode to his left flank and steadied Rawdon&#x27;s men. Instead of pursuing the fleeing militia, Webster wheeled to the left, into the Continentals. One of the North Carolina militia brigades that had been stationed next to the Delaware Line held its ground, the only militia unit to do so.

De Kalb called up the reserve 1st Maryland Brigade to support the 2nd, but they could get no closer than several hundred feet. However, as Lt. Col. Benjamin Ford of the 6th Maryland Regiment stated to Williams&#x27; entreaties, &quot;We are outnumbered and outflanked. See the enemy charge with bayonets.&quot; With the British closing in on three sides, Cornwallis ordered Tarleton&#x27;s cavalry to charge into the rear of the Continental line. The cavalry charge broke up the formation of the Continental troops, who finally broke and fled. However, Gist was able to move 100 Continentals in good order through a swamp, where the cavalry could not follow. Additionally, about 50 to 60 Maryland Line Continentals, under the leadership of Maj. Archibald Anderson, Lt. Col. John Eager Howard, and Capt. Robert Kirkwood, were able to retreat in good order.

According to Tarleton, &quot;rout and slaughter ensued in every quarter.&quot;

De Kalb, attempting to rally his men, was unhorsed, and would die of his numerous wounds (11 in total; 8 by bayonet and 3 by musket balls) two days later as a British prisoner. After just one hour of combat, the American troops had been utterly defeated, suffering over 2,000 casualties. Tarleton&#x27;s cavalry pursued and harried the retreating Continental troops for some before drawing rein. By that evening, Gates, mounted on a swift horse, had taken refuge away in Charlotte, North Carolina.

According to Charles Stedman, one of Cornwallis&#x27; officers. &quot;The road for some miles was strewn with the wounded and killed who had been overtaken by the legion in their pursuit. The numbers of dead horses, broken wagons, and baggage scattered on the road formed a perfect scene of horror and confusion: Arms, knapsacks, and accoutrements found were innumerable; such was the terror and dismay of the Americans.&quot;

==Casualties==
The British casualties were 69 killed, 245 wounded and 11 missing.
Hugh Rankin says, &quot;of the known dead, 162 were Continentals, 12 were South Carolina militiamen, 3 were Virginia militiamen and 63 were North Carolina militiamen&quot;. David Ramsay says, &quot;290 American wounded prisoners were carried into Camden after this action. Of this number, 206 were Continentals, 82 were North Carolina militia and 2 were Virginia militia. The resistance made by each corps may in some degree be estimated from the number of wounded. The Americans lost the whole of their artillery – 8 field pieces, upwards of 200 wagons and the greatest part of their baggage.&quot; A letter from Cornwallis to Lord George Germain, dated 21 August 1780, says that his army took &quot;about one thousand Prisoners, many of whom wounded&quot; on August 18.

Of 48 Continental officers at Camden: 5 were killed, 4 died of wounds, 4 were wounded without being captured, 11 were wounded and captured and 24 were captured without being wounded. These ratios would suggest that many of the Americans wounded in the battle escaped capture.

==Analysis==
There are many reasons given for Gates&#x27; defeat. The most prominent are the following:

===Tactical evaluation===
Gates, as a former British officer, was accustomed to the traditional British deployment of the most experienced regiments on the place of honor: the &quot;right&quot; flank of the battle line. Gates had therefore placed the Continental regiments on his right flank, and the mass of militia which had joined him—of whom nearly all of the Virginians had never been in a battle—on the left flank, facing the most experienced British regiments. Gates was also too far behind his troops to observe the battle or see what the British were doing. Tarleton believed Gates made four errors, including not taking a stronger position on Saunders&#x27; Creek before Cornwallis arrived, moving his army at night, the placement of his militia, and the adjustment of his disposition just before battle.

===Strategic evaluation===
Aside from tactics on the battlefield, Gates had made several strategic errors before joining the battle:
* His aggressive movement brought his forces deep into pro-British territory, where residents still loyal to the Crown would provide no supplies, nor join his army.
* So far from their supply lines, Gates&#x27; forces were weakened by lack of adequate food, many of them falling victim to diarrhea.
* Gates took great confidence in his victory at Saratoga but erred in mapping the inexperience of Burgoyne (his opponent in that battle) onto Cornwallis, who was a gifted strategist.

==Aftermath==

Gates proceeded onwards to Hillsborough, a distance of 180 miles, where he arrived on the 19th and then composed his report to Congress on 20 Aug. The report to the President of the Continental Congress, Samuel Huntington, began, &quot;In deepest Distress and Anxiety of Mind, I am obliged to acquaint your Excellency with the Total Defeat of the Troops under my Command.&quot; In a 30 Aug. letter to George Washington, Gates wrote, But if being unfortunate is solely a Reason sufficient for removing me from Command I shall most cheerfully submit to the Orders of Congress; and resign an office few Generals would be anxious to possess...&quot;

Gates lost control of the southern army. However, Daniel Morgan and Nathanael Greene defended Gates&#x27; actions, but not his decision to fight. Major General Greene, George Washington&#x27;s original preference, was subsequently given command of the southern army.

==Legacy==
The Camden Battlefield is located about north of Camden. Approximately 479 acres of the core of the battlefield is owned by the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, and is undergoing preservation in private-public partnership. The original five acres were owned by the Hobkirk Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution who gave their portion over to the current owners. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved more than 294 acres of the battlefield as of mid-2023. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

Aspects of the battle were included in the 2000 movie &quot;The Patriot&quot;, in which Ben and Gabriel Martin are seen watching a similar battle. Ben comments at the stupidity of Gates fighting &quot;muzzle to muzzle with Redcoats&quot;. The film is not historically accurate, depicting too many Continental troops relative to the number of militia, and showing the Continentals and militia retreating at the same time.

In 2022, the remains of 13 soldiers were discovered in shallow graves: 12 who fought for the Continental Army, and one from the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders who fought for the British. They were subsequently reburied in 2023 with full military honours. The Royal Highland Fusiliers took part in the funeral.

<doc id="241323" wikidata="Q186733" url="?curid=241323" title="Great Australian Bight">
<text>The Great Australian Bight is a large oceanic bight, or open bay, off the central and western portions of the southern coastline of mainland Australia.

There are two definitions for its extent—one by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and another by the Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS). The bight is generally considered part of the Indian Ocean, although the AHS classifies it as part of the Southern Ocean. Its coastline is characterized by cliff faces and rocky capes, making it an ideal location for whale-watching.

This oceanic feature was first encountered by European explorers in 1627, and was accurately charted by English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802. The Great Australian Bight came into existence about 50 million years ago when the supercontinent Gondwana broke apart, separating Antarctica from Australia.

The Bight&#x27;s waters are highly biodiverse, especially in zooplankton, due to specific ocean currents. However, more research is needed to fully understand the region&#x27;s complex ecosystems and the potential impacts of human activities, such as resource extraction. Southern bluefin tuna are a popular fishing target in the Bight, and there have been attempts to explore the area for oil and gas since the 1960s. However, these proposals have faced significant opposition due to the potential environmental impacts.

==Extent==

Two definitions of the extent are in use – one used by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the other used by the Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS).

The IHO defines the Great Australian Bight as having the following limits:

&quot;On the North.&quot; The south coast of the Australian mainland.

&quot;On the South.&quot; A line joining West Cape Howe () Australia to South West Cape, Tasmania.

&quot;On the East.&quot; A line from Cape Otway, Victoria to King Island and thence to Cape Grim, the northwest extreme of Tasmania.
The AHS defines the bight with a smaller area, from Cape Pasley, Western Australia, to Cape Carnot, South Australia - a distance of .

Much of the bight lies due south of the expansive Nullarbor Plain, which straddles South Australia and Western Australia. The Eyre Highway passes close to the cliffs of the bight between the Head of the Bight and Eucla.

Outside of Australia, the Great Australian Bight is generally considered part of the Indian Ocean. The AHS considers it to be part of the Southern Ocean, using the expanded Australian definition used for this ocean. The IHO in its Limits of Oceans and Seas (both the currently in-force 1953 edition and the 2002 never-approved draft) includes the bight with the Indian Ocean, while Bass Strait and the Tasman Sea are included by IHO with the South Pacific Ocean in the 2002 draft. In the 1953 edition, IHO includes Bass Strait as part of the Indian Ocean.
==Coastline==
The area around Cape Pasley is an eastern outcrop of the ancient crystalline rocks of the Yilgarn Craton. From there the coast curves north-eastwards, with an escarpment parallel to the coast. The Israelite Plain lies between the escarpment, here called the Wylie Scarp, and the shore, with a chain of coastal lagoons behind coastal dunes. As the coast turns eastwards the escarpment meets the shore, creating the Baxter Cliffs which extend for . Near Cocklebiddy the escarpment curves inland again. Here the Roe Plains extends for about along the coast, reaching about inland at their widest point. There are extensive dunefields near the shore, some bare of vegetation, and others stabilized by coastal strand vegetation, shrubland, and mallee woodland. Near Eucla and the Western Australia–South Australia border the escarpment reaches the coast again, and the Bunda Cliffs or Nullarbor Cliffs extend for to Head of the Bight.

At Head of the Bight the escarpment turns inland to the northeast. The coastline of the western Eyre Peninsula is characterised by rocky capes, bays, and islands, including Fowlers Bay, Smoky Bay, Streaky Bay, and the Nuyts Archipelago. The coastline is formed from aeolianite limestone. Waves and currents have formed beaches and dunes from eroded aeolianite sand. The southern Eyre peninsula is an outcrop of the granitic Gawler Craton.

==History and exploration==
The Great Australian Bight was first encountered by European explorers in 1627 when Dutch navigator François Thijssen sailed along its western margins. The coast was later first accurately charted by the English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802, during his circumnavigation of the Australian continent. A later land-based survey was accomplished by the English explorer Edward John Eyre.

==Natural history==

The bight came into existence when Gondwana, along what is now Wilkes Land and Terre Adélie, broke apart and separated Antarctica from Australia around 50 million years ago.

The coastline of the Great Australian Bight is characterised by cliff faces (up to high), surfing beaches and rock platforms, ideal for whale-watching. This is a popular activity during the southern hemisphere winter, when increasing numbers of southern right whales migrate to the region from their summer feeding grounds in the Antarctic. The whales come to the Bight region, especially to the Head of Bight, to calve and breed, and do not feed until they return to the Antarctic. Their numbers were severely depleted by whaling, particularly during the 19th century, but have since recovered to some extent.

The Nullarbor Plain, which borders much of the length of the Bight&#x27;s coastline, is a former seabed, uplifted during the Miocene. Consisting of limestone, it is very flat, and has an arid or semi-arid climate with very little rainfall, and high summer temperatures and high evaporation rates. It has no surface drainage, but has a karst drainage system through cave formation in the underlying limestone. North of the Nullarbor lies the Great Victoria Desert, which has an internal drainage system terminating in numerous small salt lakes.

The lack of surface runoff and terrestrial nutrients results in the relatively shallow waters of the Great Australian Bight being generally low in nutrients, and therefore oligotrophic, compared with many other continental shelves which support major fisheries. Seasonal upwelling of deep ocean water along the coast of the Eyre Peninsula in the eastern part of the Bight brings nutrients to the surface waters, with the resulting fertility creating an important marine hotspot.

The waters of the Great Australian Bight are highly biodiverse, particularly in zooplankton, due to a particular series of ocean currents. A literature review undertaken by SARDI (South Australian Research and Development Institute) on the Benthic Protection Zone of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park in 2003 states: &quot;Upwelling events during summer and autumn produce cool patches of surface water along the coast of the southern Eyre Peninsula. These patches contain elevated nutrient concentrations and support enhanced levels of primary productivity. High densities of zooplankton to the northwest of the patches indicate that the prevailing southeasterly winds transport the products of this enhanced biological production into the central GAB. These plankton communities support the highest densities of small planktivorous fishes, including sardine and anchovy, in Australian waters. Juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT) migrate into the GAB annually to feed on these rich pelagic resources.&quot;
As the nutrients are swept up from the deep water ocean floor and pushed in towards the coast, the food chain is injected with a massive influx of the bottom rung.

There is not enough known about the full scope of species that dwell in or migrate to the Great Australian Bight, so more studies are required. &quot;The Interim Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia (IMCRA) classification suggests that high biodiversity in the GAB may be explained by the presence of temperate species with eastern and western affinities, as well as “tropical stragglers” from northern regions. However, patterns of diversity vary between taxa. Mangroves are poorly represented due to the lack of estuaries. Seagrasses are confined mainly to sheltered bays and the lees of reefs and islands due to the frequent disturbance of inshore habitats by large swells. In contrast, the macroalgal assemblage of the GAB is one of the world&#x27;s most diverse and includes &gt;1200 species. Over 90% of species in most invertebrate groups are endemic to southern Australia, but the proportion that is confined to the GAB is unknown.&quot;

There is still much research needed to fully understand the complex ecosystems of the Great Australian Bight and how any resource extraction or other human activity may affect them. The Literature review also states: &quot;Approximately 370 of the 600 fish species that occur in southern Australia have been recorded in SA. Several species, including the coastal stingaree (&quot;Urolophus orarius&quot;) and crested threefin (&quot;Trinorfolkia cristata&quot;), are restricted to South Australia and occur in the GAB. The patterns of distribution and abundance of fishes in the GAB are poorly understood.&quot;

There are some clear findings from the review, &quot;The GAB provides critical habitat for two species of marine mammals that are recognised internationally as being priorities for conservation. The southern right whale (&quot;Eubalaena australis&quot;), which is listed as ‘endangered’ under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, breeds at the Head of Bight during winter. The Australian sea lion (&quot;Neophoca cinerea&quot;), which is endemic to Australia and is currently listed as “near threatened”, breeds in small colonies along the cliffs of the GAB.&quot; These marine mammals require this habitat to remain in existence, which has been recognised by Australian law.

One location on the bight that is specifically oriented towards the understanding of the natural history on its coastline is the Eyre Bird Observatory.

==Current conditions==
Economically, the Bight has been exploited over many years as part of the fishing, whaling and shellfish industries. Southern bluefin tuna have been a favoured target of fishing in the Bight.

Exploration for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight first began in the late 1960s. Several oil majors — BP, Statoil/Equinor, and Chevron — proposed plans to drill exploration wells in the southern part of the area from 2017 onwards. On 11 October 2016, BP withdrew its plans to explore the area stating that it was not competitive and did not align with BP&#x27;s strategic goals. The proposal to explore in the bight was the focus of community opposition. The Wilderness Society showed that a worst-case scenario leak of oil could have a catastrophic effect on the southern coastline of Australia. The Australian Senate commenced an inquiry into oil or gas production in the Great Australian Bight on 22 February 2016. The committee was reestablished on 13 September 2016 following the Australian Federal Election. In October 2017, Chevron withdrew from the project, but it returned alongside BP in 2019. Though the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority approved exploration plans in late 2019, Equinor withdrew from the project in February 2020, citing profitability reasons.

The settlements existing along the coastline of the bight, such as Ceduna and Eucla have facilities to access the bight. Some other locations on the Eyre Highway or located on the Nullarbor do not have facilities or easy access.

<text>Stewardship is a practice committed to ethical value that embodies the responsible planning and management of resources. The concepts of stewardship can be applied to the environment and nature, economics, health, places, property, information, theology, and cultural resources.

==Etymology==
Stewardship was originally made up of the tasks of a domestic steward, from (&quot;house&quot;, &quot;hall&quot;) and , (&quot;ward&quot;, &quot;guard&quot;, &quot;guardian&quot;, &quot;keeper&quot;). In the beginning, it referred to the household servant&#x27;s duties for bringing food and drink to the castle&#x27;s dining hall. Stewardship responsibilities were eventually expanded to include the domestic, service and management needs of the entire household.

Commercial stewardship tends to the domestic and service requirements of passengers on ships, trains, airplanes or guests in restaurants. This concept of stewardship continues to be referenced within these specific categories. Stewardship is now generally recognized as the acceptance or assignment of responsibility to shepherd and safeguard the valuables of others.

The NOAA Planet Stewards Education Project (PSEP) is an example of an environmental stewardship program in the United States to advance scientific literacy especially in areas that conserve, restore, and protect human communities and natural resources in the areas of climate, ocean, and atmosphere. It includes professional teachers of students of all ages and abilities, and informal educators who work with the public in nature and science centers, aquaria, and zoos. The project began in 2008 as the NOAA Climate Stewards Project. Its name was changed to NOAA Planet Stewards Educational Project in 2016.</text><links>

<doc id="241330" wikidata="Q754747" url="?curid=241330" title="Corn snake">
<text>The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus), sometimes called red rat snake is a species of North American rat snake in the family Colubridae. The species subdues its small prey by constriction. It is found throughout the southeastern and central United States. Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;) and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, the corn snake lacks functional venom and is harmless. The corn snake is beneficial to humans because it helps to control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease.

==Nomenclature==
The corn snake is named for the species&#x27; regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that eat harvested corn (maize). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites this usage as far back as 1675, whilst other sources maintain that the corn snake is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake&#x27;s belly scales resembles the kernels of variegated corn.

The genus name &quot;Panthērophis&quot; literally means &quot;panther snake&quot; in reference to the snake&#x27;s panther-like skin pattern; from : &quot;pánthēr&quot; &quot;panther&quot;, and : &quot;óphis&quot; &quot;snake&quot;.

The species name is from meaning &quot;spotted, speckled&quot;, again in reference to the snake&#x27;s skin pattern.

==Description==
As an adult the corn snake may have a total length (including tail) of . In the wild, it usually lives around ten to fifteen years, but in captivity can live to an age of 23 years or more. The record for the oldest corn snake in captivity was 32 years and 3 months. The natural corn snake is usually orange or brown bodied with large red blotches outlined in black down their backs. The belly has distinctive rows of alternating black and white marks. This black and white checker pattern is similar to Indian corn (maize) which is where the name corn snake may have come from. The corn snake can be distinguished from a copperhead by the corn snake&#x27;s brighter colors, slender build, slim head, round pupils, and lack of heat-sensing pits.

==Taxonomy==
Until 2002, the corn snake was considered to have two subspecies: the nominate subspecies (&quot;P. g. guttatus&quot;) described here and the Great Plains rat snake (&quot;P. g. emoryi)&quot;. The latter has since been split off as its own species (&quot;P. emoryi)&quot;, but is still occasionally treated as a subspecies of the corn snake by hobbyists.

&quot;P. guttatus&quot; has been suggested to be split into three species: the corn snake (&quot;P. guttatus&quot;), the Great Plains rat snake (&quot;P. emoryi&quot;, corresponding with the subspecies &quot;P. g. emoryi)&quot;, and Slowinski&#x27;s corn snake (&quot;P. slowinskii&quot;, occurring in western Louisiana and adjacent Texas).

&quot;P. guttatus&quot; was previously placed in the genus &quot;Elaphe&quot;, but &quot;Elaphe&quot; was found to be paraphyletic by et al., leading to placement of this species in the genus &quot;Pantherophis&quot;. The placement of &quot;P. guttatus&quot; and several related species in &quot;Pantherophis&quot; rather than in &quot;Elaphe&quot; has been confirmed by further phylogenetic studies. Many reference materials still use the synonym &quot;Elaphe guttata&quot;. Molecular data have shown that the corn snake is actually more closely related to kingsnakes (genus &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;) than it is to the Old World rat snakes (genus &quot;Elaphe&quot;) with which it was formerly classified. The corn snake has even been bred in captivity with the California kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis californiae&quot;) to produce fertile hybrids known as &quot;jungle corn snakes&quot;.

==Range==
===Natural habitat===
In the wild, the corn snake prefers habitats such as overgrown fields, forest openings, trees, palmetto flatwoods, and abandoned or seldom-used buildings and farms, from sea level to as high as . Typically, the corn snake remains on the ground until the age of four months but can ascend trees, cliffs, and other elevated surfaces. It can be found in the Southeastern United States ranging from New Jersey to the Florida Keys.

In colder regions, the corn snake brumates during winter. However, in the more temperate climate along the coast, it shelters in rock crevices and logs during cold weather. It also can find shelter in small, closed spaces, such as under a house, and come out on warm days to soak up the heat of the sun. During cold weather, the corn snake is less active so it hunts less.

===Introduced range===
Often called the &quot;American corn snake&quot;, &quot;P. guttatus&quot; is a proscribed pest in much of Australia. There are active extermination campaigns and advice for the public in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.

==Reproduction==
It has been found that corn snakes (along with other colubrids) reach sexual maturity by means of size, as opposed to age.

Corn snakes are relatively easy to breed. Although not necessary, they are usually put through a cooling (also known as brumation) period that takes 60–90 days to get them ready for breeding. Corn snakes brumate around in a place where they cannot be disturbed and with little sunlight.

Corn snakes usually breed shortly after the winter cooling. The male courts the female primarily with tactile and chemical cues, then everts one of his hemipenes, inserts it into the female, and ejaculates his sperm. If the female is ovulating, the eggs will be fertilized and she will begin sequestering nutrients into the eggs, then secreting a shell.

Egg-laying occurs slightly more than a month after mating, with 12–24 eggs deposited into a warm, moist, hidden location. Once laid, the adult snake abandons the eggs and does not return to them. The eggs are oblong with leathery, flexible shells. About 10 weeks after laying, the young snakes use a specialized scale called an egg tooth to slice slits in the egg shell, from which they emerge at about long.

Reproduction in captivity has to be done correctly so the clutch&#x27;s mortality rate decreases. This includes accurate sexing, establishing proper pre-breeding conditioning, and timely pairing of adults. Corn snakes are temperate zone colubrids, and share a reproductive pattern where females increase their feeding during summer and fall. This only applies to corn snakes that are sexually mature, which typically indicates the snake is around 75 cm (30 inches) in length or weight 250 g.

==Diet==

Like all snakes, corn snakes are carnivorous and, in the wild, they eat every few days. While most corn snakes eat small rodents, such as the white-footed mouse, they may also eat other reptiles, or amphibians, or climb trees to find unguarded bird eggs.

Seasons play a large role in the thermal regulation patterns of corn snakes, which is the main mechanism of digestion for snakes. During fall, corn snakes maintain a body temperature approximately 3 degrees Celsius higher than the surrounding environment after consuming a meal, while corn snakes in the winter are not seen to thermoregulate after digestion. Captive snakes do this by using heat mats as an underneath heat source replicates their natural conditions. Corn snakes demonstrate nocturnal patterns, and use the warm ground at night to thermoregulate, therefore heat mats replicate this source.

American &quot;rat snakes&quot;, such as &quot;P. guttatus&quot;, had venomous ancestors, which lost their venom after they evolved constriction as a means of prey capture.

==Intelligence and behavior==
Like many species of the Colubridae, corn snakes exhibit defensive tail vibration behavior.
Behavioral and chemosensory studies with corn snakes suggest that odor cues are of primary importance for prey detection, whereas visual cues are of secondary importance.

A study conducted by Dr. David Holzman of the University of Rochester in 1999 found that snakes&#x27; capacity for spatial learning rivals those of birds and rodents. Holzman challenged the typical testing method that was being used by biologists to examine snakes&#x27; navigational abilities, claiming the structure of the arena itself was biologically in favor of rodents. He hypothesized that if the typical arena being used to test the animals was modified to cater to snakes&#x27; instinctive goals, thus providing them with problem sets that they would likely encounter in their natural environment, this would give a more accurate view of their intelligence.

The study involved testing 24 captive-bred corn snakes, placing them in an open tub with walls too high for them to climb out. Eight holes were cut out underneath, with one hole leading to a shelter. An intense light was positioned to shine directly on the arena, exploiting the snake&#x27;s natural aversion to bright open spaces. This provided a biologically meaningful objective for the snakes: to seek out cozy dark shelter.

The study found that when given the incentive of finding shelter, the snakes exhibited an acute ability to learn and navigate their surroundings. They also found snakes rely on their sense of vision much more than many herpetologists had previously assumed. They found that younger snakes were able to more quickly locate the holes than older snakes, as the younger snakes were more resourceful in their application of senses and older snakes relied more heavily on their sense of sight.

==In captivity==
Corn snakes are one of the most popular types of snakes to keep in captivity or as pets, second only to the ball python. Outside of their native range, they are a popular pet snake in Brazil, where they risk becoming an invasive species. Their size, calm temperament, and ease of care contribute to this popularity. Captive corn snakes tolerate being handled by their owners, even for extended periods. 

== Variations ==

After many generations of selective breeding, captive bred corn snakes are found in a wide variety of different colors and patterns. These result from recombining the dominant and recessive genes that code for proteins involved in chromatophore development, maintenance, or function. New variations, or morphs, become available every year as breeders gain a better understanding of the genetics involved.

===Color morphs===
* Normal / Carolina / Wildtype – Orange with black lines around red-colored saddle markings going down their back and with black-and-white checkered bellies. Regional diversity is found in wild-caught corn snakes, the most popular being the Miami and Okeetee Phases. These are the most commonly seen corn snakes.
* Miami Phase (originates in the Florida Wildtype) – Usually smaller corn snakes with some specimens having highly contrasting light silver to gray ground color with red or orange saddle markings surrounded in black. Selective breeding has lightened the ground color and darkened the saddle marks. The &quot;Miami&quot; name is now considered an appearance trait.
* Okeetee Phase – Characterized by deep red dorsal saddle marks, surrounded by very black borders on a bright orange ground color. As with the Miami Phase, selective breeding has changed the term &quot;Okeetee&quot; to an appearance rather than a locality. Some on the market originate solely from selectively breeding corn snakes from the Okeetee Hunt Club.
* Candy-cane (selectively bred amelanistic) – Amelanistic corn snakes, bred toward the ideal of red or orange saddle marks on a white background. Some were produced using light Creamsicle (an amel hybrid from Great Plains rat snake x corn snake crosses) bred with Miami Phase corn snakes. Some Candy-canes will develop orange coloration around the neck region as they mature and many labeled as Candy-canes later develop significant amounts of yellow or orange in the ground color. The contrast they have as hatchlings often fades with maturity.
* Reverse Okeetee (selectively bred amelanistic) – An amelanistic Okeetee Phase corn snake, which has the normal black rings around the saddle marks replaced with wide white rings. Ideal specimens are high contrast snakes with light orange to yellow background and dark orange/red saddles. Note: An Albino Okeetee is not a locale-specific Okeetee—it is a selectively bred amelanistic.
* Fluorescent Orange (selectively bred amelanistic) – A designer amelanistic corn snake that develops white borders around bright red saddle marks as adults on an orange background.
* Sunglow (selectively bred amelanistic) – Another designer amelanistic corn snake that lacks the usual white speckling that often appears in most albinos and selected for exceptionally bright ground color. The orange background surrounds dark orange saddle marks.
* Blood Red (selectively bred &quot;diffused&quot;) – Carry a recessive trait (known as diffused) that eliminates the ventral checkered patterns. These originated from a somewhat unicolor Jacksonville, Florida and Gainesville, Florida strain of corn snake. Through selective breeding, an almost solid ground color has been produced. Hatchlings have a visible pattern that can fade as they mature into a solid orange-red to ash-red colored snake. The earlier Blood Red corn snakes tended to have large clutches of smaller than average eggs that produce hard-to-feed offspring, though this is no longer the case.
* Crimson (Hypomelanistic + Miami) – Very light high contrast corn snakes, with a light background and dark red/orange saddle marks.
* Anerythristic (anerythristic type A, sometimes called &quot;Black Albino&quot;) – The complement to amelanism. The inherited recessive mutation of lacking erythrin (red, yellow and orange) pigments produces a corn snake that is mostly black, gray and brown. When mature, many anerythristic type A corn snakes develop yellow on their neck regions, which is a result of the carotenoids in their diet.

* Charcoal (sometimes known as anerythristic type B) – Can lack the yellow color pigment usually found in all corn snakes. They are a more muted contrast compared to Anerythristics.
* Caramel – Another Rich Zuchowski-engineered corn snake. The background is varying shades of yellow to yellow-brown. Dorsal saddle marks vary from caramel yellow to brown and chocolate brown.
* Lavender – Have a light pink background with darker purple-gray markings. They also have ruby- to burgundy-colored eyes.
* Cinder – Originated with Upper Keys corn snakes and, as such, are often built slimmer than most other morphs. They may resemble anerythristics, but they have wavy borders around their saddles.
* Kastanie – Hatch out looking nearly anerythristic, but gain some color as they mature, to eventually take on a chestnut coloration. This gene was first discovered in Germany.
* Hypomelanistic (or Hypo for short) – Carry a recessive trait that reduces the dark pigments, causing the reds, whites and oranges to become more vivid. Their eyes remain dark. They range in appearance between amelanistic corn snakes to normal corn snakes with greatly reduced melanin.
* Ultra – A hypomelanistic-like gene that is an allele to the amelanistic gene. Ultra corn snakes have light gray lines in place of black. The Ultra gene is derived from the gray rat snake (&quot;Pantherophis spiloides&quot;). All Ultra and Ultramel corn snakes have some amount of gray rat snake in them.
* Ultramel – An intermediate appearance between Ultra and amel, which is the result of being heterozygous for Ultra and amel at the albino locus.
* Dilute – Another melanin-reducing gene in which the corn snake looks as if it is getting ready to shed.
* Sunkissed – A hypo-like gene which was first found in Kathy Love&#x27;s corn snake colony.
* Lava – An extreme hypo-like gene which was discovered by Joe Pierce and named by Jeff Mohr. What would normally be black pigment in these corn snakes is, instead, a grayish-purple.

===Pattern morphs===

* Motley – Has a clear belly and an &quot;inverted&quot; spotting pattern. May also appear as stripes or dashes.
* Striped – This morph also has a clear belly and a striping pattern. Unlike the Motley corn snake, the striped corn snake&#x27;s colors will not connect, but may sometimes break up and take on a &quot;cubed&quot; appearance. Cubes and spots on a striped corn snake are the same as the saddle color on a similar-looking normal corn snake, unlike Motley corn snakes. Striped is both allelic and recessive to Motley, so breeding a striped corn snake and a (homozygous) Motley corn snake will result in all-Motley corn snakes and then breeding the (heterozygous) Motley corn snake offspring will result in ¾ Motley corn snakes and ¼ striped corn snakes.
* Diffused – Diffuses the patterning on the sides and eliminates the belly pattern. It is one component of the Blood Red morph.
* Sunkissed – While considered a hypo-like gene, sunkissed corn snakes also have other effects, such as rounded saddles and unusual head patterns.
* Aztec, Zigzag and Banded – Selectively bred multigenetic morphs that are not dependent on a single gene.

===Compound morphs===
There are tens of thousands of possible compound morphs. Some of the most popular ones are listed here.
* Snow (amelanistic + Anerythristic) – As hatchlings, this color variation is composed of white and pink blotches. These corn snakes are predominantly white and tend to have yellow neck and throat regions when mature (due to carotenoid retention in their diet). Light blotches and background colors have subtle shades of beige, ivory, pink, green or yellow.
* Blizzard (amelanistic + Charcoal) – Totally white with red eyes, with very little to no visible pattern. This morph is formed by combining amelanistic (amel) gene and anerythristic gene.
* Ghost (Hypomelanistic + Anerythristic type A) – Exhibit varying shades of grays and browns on a lighter background. These often create pastel colors in lavenders, pinks, oranges and tans.
* Phantom – A combination of Charcoal and Hypomelanistic.
* Pewter (Charcoal + Diffused) – Silvery-lavender, with very little pattern as adults.
* Butter (amelanistic + Caramel) – A two-tone yellow corn snake.
* Amber (Hypomelanistic + Caramel) – Have amber-colored markings on a light brown background.

* Plasma (Diffused + Lavender) – Hatch out in varying shades of grayish-purple.
* Opal (amelanistic + Lavender) – Look like Blizzard corn snakes once mature, with pink to purple highlights.
* Granite (Diffused + Anerythristic) – Tend to be varying shades of gray as adults, with males often having pink highlights.
* Fire (amelanistic + Diffused) – An albino version of the Diffused morph. These corn snakes are typically very bright red snakes, with very little pattern as adults.

===Scale mutations===
* Scaleless corn snakes are homozygous for a recessive mutation of the gene responsible for scale development. While not completely scaleless above, some do have fewer scales than others. However, all of them possess ventral (belly) scales. They can also be produced with any of the aforementioned color morphs. The first Scaleless corn snakes originated from the cross of another North American rat snake species to a corn snake and they are therefore, technically, hybrids. Scaleless mutants of many other snake species have also been documented in the wild.

===Hybrids===
Hybrids between corn snakes and any other snake is very common in captivity, but rarely occurs in the wild. Hybrids within the genera &quot;Pantherophis&quot;, &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;, or &quot;Pituophis&quot; so far have been proven to be completely fertile.

Many different corn snake hybrids are bred in captivity. A few common examples include:
* Jungle corn snakes are hybrids between a corn snake and a California kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis californiae&quot;). These show extreme pattern variations, taking markings from both parents. Although they are hybrids of different genera, they are not sterile.
* Tri-color Jungle corn snakes are hybrids between a Querétaro kingsnake and a corn snake. The color is similar to that of an amelanistic corn snake.
* Creamsicle corn snakes are hybrids between an albino corn snake and a Great Plains rat snake (&quot;P. emoryi&quot;). The first-generation hybrids are known as &quot;Rootbeers&quot;. Breeding these back to each other can produce Creamsicles.
* Turbo corn snakes are hybrids between a corn snake and any &quot;Pituophis&quot; species.
* Corn snakes hybridized with milk snakes are called a variety of names, depending on the subspecies of milk snake used. For example, a Honduran milk snake × corn snake is called a Cornduran, a Sinaloan milk snake × corn snake is called a Sinacorn and a Pueblan milk snake × corn snake is called a Pueblacorn.
* Brook Korn corn snakes are hybrids between a Brook&#x27;s kingsnake and a corn snake. Like the jungle corn snake, these hybrids also show extreme pattern variations.

When hybrids of corn snakes are found in the wild, they have usually hybridized with other &quot;Pantherophis&quot; species whose ranges overlap with corn snakes.

<doc id="241331" wikidata="Q159995" url="?curid=241331" title="Walter Hallstein">
<text>Walter Hallstein (17 November 1901 – 29 March 1982) was a German academic, diplomat and statesman who was the first president of the Commission of the European Economic Community and one of the founding fathers of the European Union.

Hallstein began his academic career in the 1920s Weimar Republic and became Germany&#x27;s youngest law professor in 1930, at the age of 29. During World War II he served as a First Lieutenant in the German Army in France. Captured by American troops in 1944, he spent the rest of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp in the United States, where he organised a &quot;camp university&quot; for his fellow soldiers. After the war he returned to Germany and continued his academic career; he became rector of the University of Frankfurt in 1946 and spent a year as a visiting professor at Georgetown University from 1948. In 1950 he was recruited to a diplomatic career, becoming the leading civil servant at the German Foreign Office, where he gave his name to the Hallstein Doctrine, West Germany&#x27;s policy of isolating East Germany diplomatically.

A keen advocate of a federal Europe, Hallstein played a key role in West German foreign policy and then in European integration. He was one of the architects of the European Coal and Steel Community and the first President of the Commission of the European Economic Community, which would later become the European Union. He held the office from 1958 to 1967 and was the only German to be selected as president of the European Commission or its predecessors until the selection of Ursula von der Leyen in 2019. Hallstein famously described his role as &quot;a kind of European prime minister&quot; and dismissed national sovereignty as a &quot;doctrine of yesteryear.&quot;

Hallstein left office following a clash with the President of France, Charles de Gaulle; he turned to German politics as a member of the Bundestag, also serving as President of the European Movement from 1968 to 1974. He is the author of books and numerous articles and speeches on European integration and on the European Communities.

==Early life and pre-war academic career==
Walter Hallstein was born on 17 November 1901 in Mainz, Germany. After primary school in Darmstadt he attended a classical school in Mainz from 1913 until his matriculation (&quot;Abitur&quot;) in 1920.
From 1920 Hallstein studied law in Bonn, later moving to Munich and then to Berlin. He specialized in international private law and wrote his doctoral dissertation on commercial aspects of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. He obtained his doctorate from the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1925  – at the age of 23. From 1923 to 1926 he was a legal clerk at the &#x27;, and in 1927, having passed his &quot;qualifying&quot; examination, he was employed for a very brief spell as a judge. He then worked as an academic at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Foreign Private and International Private Law in Berlin, where he specialized in comparative commercial and company law, working under Professor Martin Wolff, a leading scholar of private law. He would remain there until 1930. In 1929 he obtained his &quot;Habilitation&quot; from the University of Berlin, based on a thesis on company law. In 1930, at the age of 29, he was appointed professor of private law and company law at the University of Rostock, making him Germany&#x27;s youngest professor of law. He was made Deputy Dean (&#x27;) of the Faculty of Law in 1935 and then Dean in 1936. He remained in Rostock until 1941. From 1941 to 1944 Hallstein lectured at Frankfurt University, where he was Director of the Institute for Comparative Law and Economic Law.

In 1935, Hallstein attempted to start a military career alongside his academic duties. In 1936, he managed to integrate a voluntary military service in an artillery unit. In the years between 1936 and 1939, he attended several military courses and was made a reserve officer.
Hallstein was a member of several nominally Nazi professional organizations, but he was not a member of the Nazi Party or of the SA. He is reputed to have rejected Nazi ideology and to have kept his distance from the Nazis. There was opposition from Nazi officials to his proposed appointment, in 1941, as professor of law at the University of Frankfurt, but the academics pushed through his candidacy, and he soon advanced to become dean of the faculty.

==Soldier and prisoner of war (1942–1945)==

In 1942 Hallstein was called up; he served in an artillery regiment of the Wehrmacht in Northern France with the rank of first lieutenant (&#x27;). In early 1944, Hallstein&#x27;s name was submitted by the University of Frankfurt as a potential &#x27; to the National Socialist Lecturers League. On 26 June 1944, during the Battle of Cherbourg, he was captured by the Americans and sent to Camp Como, a prisoner-of-war camp in Mississippi.

As a German prisoner of war (POW) in the United States, Hallstein started a &quot;camp university&quot;, where he held law courses for the prisoners. As part of the &quot; Sunflower Project&quot;, a project to re-educate German POWs, he attended an &quot;administrative school&quot; at Fort Getty, where teaching included the principles of the Constitution of the United States. Hallstein remained a prisoner of war from June 1944 to mid-1945.

==Post-war academic career (1945–1950)==
In November 1945 Hallstein returned to Germany, where he campaigned for Frankfurt University to be re-opened. Turning down an offer from Ludwig Erhard to be deputy minister at the Bavarian Ministry of Economics, he became a professor at Frankfurt University on 1 February 1946, and in April he was elected its rector, a position he retained until 1948. He was president of the South German Rectors&#x27; Conference, which he founded. From 1948 to 1949, he spent a year as visiting professor at Georgetown University in Washington D.C.

Hallstein was co-founder of the German national UNESCO committee and was its president from 1949 to 1950.

==Diplomatic career (1950–1957)==

===Foreign affairs at the Chancellery (1950–1951)===

Against the background of the Second World War, a conflict that had caused massive destruction and left the continent split in two by the Iron Curtain, there were calls for increased cooperation in Europe. The French foreign minister, Robert Schuman, put forward a plan, originating from Jean Monnet, for a European Coal and Steel Community that would unify control of German and French coal and steel production, and talks were started with this aim.
Germany had still not regained its sovereignty following defeat in World War II, and was represented internationally by the Allied High Commission. There was no German foreign office and, for a time, foreign affairs were dealt with by the Chancellery.

Konrad Adenauer, the German Chancellor, called Hallstein to Bonn, at the suggestion of Wilhelm Röpke, and in June 1950 he appointed him to head the German delegation at the Schuman Plan negotiations in Paris, which were to lead to the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community. Jean Monnet, the leader of the French delegation, and Hallstein drew up the Schuman Plan, which was the basis for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established by the Treaty of Paris in 1951. The ECSC was to develop into the European Economic Community, and later the European Union. In August 1950, to general surprise, Hallstein was made head of the Office of Foreign Affairs (&#x27;) at the Federal Chancellery (&#x27;). At this time, little was known about Hallstein, except that he had not been a member of the Nazi Party and that he was on good terms with US officials.

===State Secretary at the Foreign Office (1951–1958)===

Following a change in the Occupation Statute, the German Foreign Office was re-created in March 1951, but the post of Foreign Minister was filled by Adenauer himself. On 2 April 1951, Hallstein was made the leading civil servant at the newly created Foreign Office. Foreign policy continued to be managed by Adenauer himself with his group of intimates, including Hallstein, Blankenhorn and others. In many respects, Hallstein was the West German Foreign Minister in all but name, but there was a growing awareness that a separate officeholder was needed. Adenauer is said to have considered Hallstein for the position, even though he was not a member of a political party.
Hallstein also played an important part in promoting West Germany&#x27;s goals of regaining sovereignty and creating a European Defence Community (EDC), of which West Germany would be a member. Negotiations at first resulted in two international agreements:
* On 26 May 1952, the Treaty of Bonn was signed by the United States, United Kingdom, France, and West Germany; on ratification, it would largely restore sovereignty to the Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;de facto&quot; West Germany, but not including West Berlin, which retained a special status).
* On 27 May 1952, the Treaty of Paris was signed by the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany; on ratification, it would have established the European Defence Community (EDC).
However, the Treaty of Paris failed to obtain the necessary approval of the French Parliament. Instead, a solution involving the Western European Union (WEU) was agreed upon, and West Germany was to become a member of NATO. The efforts to resolve the issues culminated, in 1954, in a series of conferences in London and Paris. The German side was represented by Adenauer, the German chancellor, together with the top civil servants at the German Foreign Office: Hallstein, his colleague Blankenhorn, and his deputy, Grewe. Hallstein helped negotiate various treaties at the London Nine-Power Conference from 23 September to 3 October 1954; they were finalized at the Paris conference from 20 to 23 October 1954. The conferences in Paris included a meeting of the parties to the Nine-Power Conference in London (20 October), a meeting of the seven WEU members (20 October), a meeting of the Four Powers to end the occupation of Germany (21–22 October), and a meeting of all fourteen NATO members to approve Germany&#x27;s membership.

After the ratification of the Paris Accords on 5 May 1955, the General Treaty (&quot;Deutschlandvertrag&quot;), which largely restored (West) German sovereignty, took full effect; the Federal Republic of Germany became a member of NATO.


Once the major foreign policy objectives were in hand, Hallstein set about restoring Germany&#x27;s diplomatic service and re-organizing the Foreign Office, based on the findings of the Maltzan Report, a report commissioned by Hallstein on 26 June 1952 and produced a month later by Vollrath Freiherr von Maltzan, a former diplomat, at that time on loan from the Ministry of Economics.

There was criticism of a lack of information and consultation and an atmosphere of secrecy, possibly resulting from Adenauer&#x27;s distrust of the old hands at the Foreign Office, the &quot;Wilhelmstraße&quot; veterans, as well as the desire to fill top jobs with outsiders not tainted by having served as diplomats under the Nazis.
There were suggestions of a disconnect between the leadership (consisting of Adenauer and a small group of close advisers, including Hallstein and Blankenhorn) on the one hand and the division leaders at the Foreign Office and the diplomatic missions on the other. In particular, Hallstein was also criticised in the press after the European Defence Community was rejected by the French National Assembly, as had been predicted by the German diplomatic mission in Paris.

On 6 June 1955, Adenauer, who had until then been Foreign Minister as well as Chancellor, appointed Heinrich von Brentano foreign minister and there was a reshuffling of responsibilities, but Hallstein retained the trust of Adenauer and continued to attend cabinet meetings. Herbert Blankenhorn, who until then been the head of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, became the German Permanent Representative to NATO in Paris; Wilhelm Grewe took over the Political Department under Hallstein and was made Hallstein&#x27;s deputy.
Hallstein was involved in discussions with the French concerning the return of the coal-rich Saar to Germany. In October 1955 there was a referendum held to decide whether the Saar would remain separate from Germany or be re-integrated into Germany, following which it was agreed with France that there would be political integration into the Federal Republic of Germany by 1 January 1957 and economic integration by 1 January 1960. In September 1956, Hallstein announced that France had agreed to hand over control of the Saar to Germany; on 27 October 1956, the Saar Treaty was signed.

====Hallstein Doctrine====

In 1955, Germany had in large measure regained its sovereignty and become integrated into western defence-organizations, the WEU and NATO; European integration had progressed, with the establishment of the ECSC; the Saar question was to be resolved by the referendum in October 1955. In all of these matters, Hallstein had played a major role.

Some of the main issues of German foreign policy were now German re-unification and the relations of West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany) with its eastern neighbours, including East Germany (the German Democratic Republic). Being more involved in Western European integration, Hallstein delegated much of this work to his deputy, Wilhelm Grewe. But in this area particularly, German foreign policy became associated with the name Hallstein. In 1955, Hallstein and Grewe accompanied Adenauer as members of a delegation to Moscow, where the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bonn and Moscow was agreed. It was on the flight back from Moscow that the policy that was later to become known as the Hallstein Doctrine was fleshed out, though the Foreign Office had already devised and practised elements of the policy. The idea behind the Hallstein Doctrine came from Hallstein&#x27;s deputy, Wilhelm Grewe. The doctrine would become one of the major elements of West German foreign policy from September 1955 – until official recognition of the German Democratic Republic in October 1969.
Based on the Basic Law, its &quot;de facto&quot; constitution, the Federal Republic of Germany – then commonly known in the English-speaking world as West Germany – claimed an exclusive mandate to represent the whole of Germany, including the Communist East Germany, which was aligned with the Soviet Union. One of the early objectives of West German foreign policy was the diplomatic isolation of East Germany. In 1958, journalists named this policy the &quot;Hallstein–Grewe Doctrine&quot;, which later became shortened to the &quot;Hallstein Doctrine&quot;. Grewe himself writes that he did devise the broad outlines of the policy, but mainly as one of a number of options, the decisions being made by the foreign minister, Brentano, and the chancellor, Adenauer; in any case, the name Hallstein doctrine may have been something of a misnomer.

No official text of the so-called &quot;doctrine&quot; was made public, but it was explained publicly in a radio interview by its main architect, Wilhelm Grewe. Adenauer also explained the outlines of the policy in a statement to the German parliament on 22 September 1955. It meant that the Federal German government would regard it as an &quot;unfriendly act&quot; if third countries were to recognize or maintain diplomatic relations with the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; (East Germany). The exception was the Soviet Union, as one of the Four Powers responsible for Germany. The threatened response to such an unfriendly act was often understood to mean breaking off diplomatic relations; this was not stated as an automatic response under the policy, but remained the ultima ratio.

====European integration and the Rome treaties====

Members of the German government had different positions on European integration. Hallstein and his team at the Foreign Office advocated a federal solution with a form of &quot;constitutional integration&quot; broadly based on the European Coal and Steel Community, with the scope gradually increasing to include additional sectors, and with true parliamentary representation of the European populace.
Hallstein contended that institutional integration was in the interests of a successful German export industry.
Ludwig Erhard and the Ministry of Economics argued for a looser &quot;functional integration&quot; and advocated intergovernmental economic cooperation.
Erhard opposed supranational structures and characterized the Foreign Office proponents of a federal Europe as out of touch with economic realities.
In the dispute, Adenauer finally supported Hallstein, settling the acrimonious, and public, conflict between Hallstein and Erhard.
In 1955 the foreign ministers of the European Coal and Steel Community met at the Messina Conference, among other things to nominate a member of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community and to appoint its new president and vice-presidents for the period ending 10 February 1957. The conference, which was held from 1 to 3 June 1955 in the Italian city of Messina, Sicily, would lead to the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Shortly before the conference, Adenauer had given up his double post as Foreign Minister and, since Brentano had not yet been sworn in, Hallstein led the German delegation. The agenda included discussion of an action programme to relaunch European integration following the collapse, in August 1954, of the plans to create a European Political Community and a European Defence Community, when France failed to ratify the treaty.
On 6 September 1955, shortly before Adenauer&#x27;s trip to Moscow, Hallstein, standing in for Brentano, attended the Noordwijk Conference of foreign ministers convened to evaluate progress made by the Spaak Committee. On 9 November 1955, Hallstein reported the results to the West German Cabinet, where the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Agriculture opposed the plans for a common market rather than a free trade area. The Ministry of Economics feared that a customs union meant protectionism; the Ministry of Agriculture was concerned that the interests of German farmers would be betrayed; Franz Josef Strauss opposed the perceived discrimination against German industry regarding access to uranium. Finally, the chancellor, Adenauer, again settled the dispute between the ministries by a decision in favour of Hallstein and the Foreign Office. When the Spaak Report (the &quot;Brussels Report on the General Common Market&quot;) was finally presented in April 1956, it recommended a customs union. In the Cabinet meeting of 9 May 1956, there was renewed opposition to the position of the Foreign Office from other ministers, but Adenauer lent his support to Hallstein, and the Cabinet authorized intergovernmental negotiations, to be held at the conference of foreign ministers in Venice at the end of May, the German delegation again to be led by Hallstein.
In July 1956, Britain made proposals for the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to examine the possibility of a free trade area for industrial goods. The French, mainly interested in Euratom, attempted to separate the debate on the two topics and proposed a compromise treaty under which only the general principles of a common market would be agreed, leaving details to be decided later, but Germany made negotiations on Euratom dependent on negotiations on a common market. At the Venice Conference, the French foreign minister, Christian Pineau agreed to intergovernmental negotiations, with three provisos: the economic community was to be established in stages; customs tariffs should be reduced by only 30%; and national governments should not be overly constrained with regard to economic policy. Hallstein warned against accepting the French terms, which in his view meant that the French would push for a quick decision in favour of Euratom and delay the negotiations on the common market. Hallstein was supported by the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, against France, in demanding a fixed deadline and timetable for the establishment of a common market. The French National Assembly approved the commencement of intergovernmental negotiations in July 1956, after the prime minister, Guy Mollet, gave an assurance that Euratom would not impose restrictions on the French nuclear weapons programme.
Another cause of disagreement was the inclusion of French overseas territories in any common market. Erhard strongly opposed this, partly because of the perceived danger of France involving the other member states in its colonial responsibilities. The Foreign Office shared these concerns to some extent but Hallstein and Carstens were willing to accept the French position, believing it would help gain support from the French National Assembly; Hallstein also accepted the argument of his French counterpart, Faure, that it would benefit Germany. Hallstein helped to strike a deal by which the imports and exports of overseas territories would be treated like products of the mother country and private investment and company branches of other member states would be permitted, thus opening up the overseas territories for German exports. Hallstein helped deal with these problems at two conferences of foreign ministers, one from 26 to 27 January 1957 and another on 4 February.

On 25 March 1957, the six countries Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, and the Netherlands signed the Treaties of Rome. Adenauer and Hallstein signed for Germany. The foreign minister, Brentano had largely left the negotiations to Hallstein, so the signing of the treaty represented a major success for Hallstein. It was also Hallstein who explained the treaties to the German parliament on 21 March 1957, before they were signed on 25 March 1957.

====Choosing the President of the Commission====
There had been previous suggestions of Hallstein becoming president of the European Court, but now he was put forward as the German candidate for the president of the Commission, though the Belgian Minister of Economics, Rey and the Netherlands Agriculture Minister, Mansholt were regarded as the strongest contenders for the position. The conference of foreign ministers on 20 December 1957 could not reach a decision, so when the Treaties of Rome took effect on 1 January 1958, the position had not been filled. At the conference of foreign ministers on 6 and 7 January 1958, however, Hallstein was finally chosen as the first president of the EEC Commission. Hallstein&#x27;s selection for this position at the head of a major European organization, a decade after the end of World War II, was a major achievement for Germany.

==President of the Commission of the European Economic Community (1958–1967)==
===Laying the foundations of the EEC===
Barely a decade after the end of World War II, the German Walter Hallstein was unanimously elected the first president of the Commission of the European Economic Community (now the European Commission) in Brussels. He was elected on 7 January 1958, and he was to remain in the position until 1967.

Hallstein&#x27;s Commission, which held its first meeting on 16 January 1958, comprised nine members (two each from France, Italy and Germany, one each from Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands). The tasks it faced included the implementation of a customs union and the Four Freedoms, as well as common policies on competition, trade, transport and agriculture.

Hallstein famously described his role as &quot;a kind of European prime minister&quot; and regarded national sovereignty as a &quot;doctrine of yesteryear.&quot; Though Hallstein&#x27;s personal vision of a federal Europe was clear, the EEC treaty left many questions open. Opinions were divided, for instance, on whether a common market could succeed without a common economic policy, on enlargement of the European Union – in particular, whether Britain should join – and whether the final goal should be a political union in the sense of a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;.

Differing interests and traditions in the member states and differences of opinion among the politicians meant that consensus was difficult. The disagreements that had preceded the creation of the EEC continued after it was established, and these were reflected within the Commission.
For instance, the protectionist Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the responsibility of Sicco Mansholt, the Commissioner for Agriculture, was at odds with the liberal foreign trade policy of the Commissioner for External relations, Jean Rey.


Britain had at first been against the formation of the EEC, preferring a looser free trade area, and later proposed a larger free trade area that would include the EEC and other European countries. The German government, German industry, and – especially – the Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, wanted Britain to be part of an integrated Europe.
Hallstein opposed the idea of a wider free trade area at this time, advocating first achieving a greater degree of integration among a smaller number of countries.
Discussions on the possibility of a wider trade area, avoiding the tariff wall between the EEC and the EFTA countries, continued, but in the middle of preparations for the negotiations the French government, on instructions from de Gaulle, withdrew. This unilateral action by the French in November 1958 displeased the other EEC members and effectively ended the negotiations. German politicians like Erhard felt that Hallstein and his Commission had not done enough to promote the wider free trade area.
The six countries of the EEC had decided on a customs union: they agreed to remove tariffs between one another within a period of twelve years, and to erect a common tariff barrier between themselves and other countries. Seven of the excluded European countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal) responded with an alternative free trade area, EFTA, which also removed tariff barriers between each other, but did not insist on a tariff barrier with other countries.
The EFTA convention was signed in January 1960 and was to come into force in May 1960.
On 3 March 1960, Hallstein announced a plan for accelerating the implementation of the common market, which commentators regarded as sabotaging hopes of a joint free trade area that included the EEC and EFTA.
This invoked the displeasure, not only of the EFTA countries, but also of the Economics Ministry under Erhard. Commentators talked of Hallstein&#x27;s &quot;religious zeal&quot;.
In 1961 Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, finally gave up the idea of the larger free trade area, and the United Kingdom applied to join the EEC.
Edward Heath, as Lord Privy Seal in the Macmillan government, led the negotiations in Britain&#x27;s first attempt to join the EEC. Hallstein, as president of the EEC Commission, was cautious, considering the British application premature. Of British politicians, only Heath was able to establish a rapport with Hallstein. The Financial Times (of 2 August 1961) wrote that Hallstein was one of the least enthusiastic about British membership of the EEC. In British government circles he was at first seen as siding with the French and de Gaulle, against Britain and the other five members of the EEC, who were more welcoming to Britain, and as favouring the French protectionist position. Elements of the British Press, notably the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, were critical of Hallstein – or what he represented.

It was in 1961 that de Gaulle proposed the Fouchet Plan, a plan for an intergovernmental &quot;union of states&quot;, as an alternative to the European Communities. There was little support from the other European countries, and negotiations were abandoned on 17 April 1962.

While Hallstein had a decidedly federal vision for Europe, and regarded the Commission as a quasi-federal organ, de Gaulle&#x27;s vision was of a confederation.
From the beginning, Hallstein did not believe that de Gaulle&#x27;s approach of cooperation between sovereign nation states would be able to realize his vision of a powerful Europe that could play its proper part on the world stage.
De Gaulle also envisaged a pooling of sovereignty in certain areas, such as external defence, harmonization of industrial production and foreign trade, currency, exploitation of resources in overseas territories, and cultural and scientific development, but at the same time he was developing the French nuclear deterrent capability, the &quot;&quot;, which he envisaged as part of a European defence capability independent of the United States.
This independence from the United States was one of de Gaulle&#x27;s main objectives; he was against the increased integration of Europe under the umbrella of transatlantic integration as provided for in the Rome treaties.
The Hallstein Commission drew up plans and a timetable for an economic and currency union, and Hallstein presented these to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in October 1962.
A second attempt by de Gaulle to establish a closer political union in Europe that would be independent of the United States was the Franco-German bilateral treaty on political cooperation. This treaty between France and Germany, which was signed on 22 January 1963, was criticized by other countries as being incompatible with the EEC and NATO treaties. Hallstein and other members of the Commission also criticized the treaty, and this angered de Gaulle.
When the treaty was ratified by West Germany, the German Bundestag unilaterally added a preamble that re-affirmed the commitment to close transatlantic ties, the enlargement of the existing European Communities and attempts to secure Britain&#x27;s accession. Since Britain had firmly expressed its unwillingness to support an autonomous European defence independent of America, de Gaulle regarded the treaty as a failure.

Further attempts by de Gaulle at military cooperation with Germany to the exclusion of America were rebuffed by Erhard (now Federal Chancellor) and his foreign minister Gerhard Schröder. Britain&#x27;s application for membership of the EEC was vetoed by de Gaulle in 1963, which also further antagonized the other participants.

===Confrontation with de Gaulle===
De Gaulle took a confrontational course on the Common Agricultural Policy, and on 21 October 1964, the French Minister of Information, Alain Peyrefitte announced that France would leave the EEC if the European Agricultural market were not implemented in the agreed form by 15 December 1964. On 1 December 1964, Erhard, now head of government in Germany, announced that Germany would accede to French demands for a common wheat price, and on 15 December the Council of Ministers laid down common grain prices from 1 July 1967 and instructed the Commission to submit proposals for financing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by 1 July 1965.
Differences between France and the Commission – and especially between de Gaulle and Hallstein – were exacerbated when France held the rotating six-month Presidency of the council, from January to June 1965.

The Council of Ministers instructed the Commission to submit plans by 1 April 1965 on how to finance the Common Agricultural Policy as from July 1965, including its financing from direct levies rather than national contributions; this would entail a transfer of revenues to the Community. 
The ministers representing other countries, in particular the Netherlands, indicated that their national parliaments would not approve the transfer of revenues to the Community unless the rights of the European Parliament were strengthened.
On 20 January 1965, the European Parliament passed a resolution appealing to the governments to take this step toward strengthening a democratic and federal Europe.
Hallstein supported this.
Hallstein had received indications that other countries shared his point of view and decided to risk the confrontation with de Gaulle, interpreting the instructions from the Council broadly, with the support of Dutch Commissioner for Agriculture, Sicco Mansholt.
The majority of the Commission backed Hallstein.
On 24 March 1965, Hallstein presented the Commission&#x27;s proposals for financing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the European Parliament. It was proposed that customs duties collected at EEC borders would go to the community budget and that the Common Agricultural Market would be implemented as scheduled on 1 July 1967 – but the customs union for industrial products would also be implemented at the same time, two and a half years earlier than provided for in the Rome Treaty.
The proposals would have allowed the Community to develop its own financial resources independently of the member states and given more budgetary powers to the European Parliament.
From 1 January 1966, voting in the Council was to be by simple majority, removing the implicit veto power of individual countries. The French government stated it could not agree to this.

Since the legislation would increase not only the Commission&#x27;s powers but also the Parliament&#x27;s, Hallstein had the support of the Parliament, which had long been campaigning for more powers.
Before the proposals were presented to the Council, they became public, and Hallstein then presented them to the European Parliament on 24 March, a week before presenting them to the council. When Hallstein put forward his proposals, the council was already concerned.
France rejected the idea of the increased powers for the European Parliament and of the Community having its own independent revenues, insisting that what had been agreed by the Council regarding the financing of the common agricultural policy be implemented by 30 June 1965.
He accused Hallstein of acting as if he were a head of state. 
France was particularly concerned about protecting the CAP because – under a majority system – it could be challenged by the other members.
After discussions between France and Germany, a compromise was at first reached, postponing implementation of the agricultural levies until 1970, but at the Council meeting of 28 June the Netherlands foreign minister, Joseph Luns, and his Italian counterpart, Amintore Fanfani, insisted that all of the Commission&#x27;s proposals should be discussed as a package. German diplomats supported this position, and the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; passed a resolution stating that the Commission&#x27;s proposals did not go far enough; Germany did not want to agree to the plans for agricultural financing without being assured that France would not hinder a general reduction in tariffs in the Kennedy Round.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives of the foreign ministers produced a report recommending a compromise by making both the agricultural levies and the customs duties available to be used for Community purposes but not centralizing the process; however, Hallstein refused to broker this deal and suggested employing the common practice of &quot;stopping the clock&quot; until the issue could be resolved.
Under pressure from Couve de Murville, who was the rotating President of the Council at the time, Hallstein agreed, on 30 June 1965, to work out a compromise. The same day, however, after consulting with de Gaulle, Couve de Murville announced that no agreement had been reached by the agreed deadline and that the negotiations had failed. 
France&#x27;s presidency of the council, which rotated every six months, terminated on 30 June 1965.

====Empty Chair Crisis====

A few days later, on de Gaulle&#x27;s instructions, France ceased participation in all meetings of the Council of Ministers and the Council of Permanent Representatives that dealt with any new decisions. Participation in many working groups ceased, and the French Permanent Representative to the EU, Jean-Marc Boegner was recalled, together with 18 high-ranking civil servants and diplomats.
In an attempt to resolve the situation, Hallstein, together with Marjolin, the (French) vice-president of the Commission, drew up a new plan, continuing the provisional arrangement for agricultural finances until 1 January 1970. This proposal was presented to the council on 22 June 1965.
De Gaulle, however, remained confrontational toward Hallstein and the Brussels &quot;technocrats&quot;. In September 1965, he publicly declared his opposition to majority voting and the political role of the Commission. Since a treaty change required unanimity, there was a stalemate, and there was no provision in the treaties to cover such a boycott of the normal running of the Community. At least in Hallstein&#x27;s eyes, it was a breach of treaty obligations, and he was unprepared for such a scenario.
On 20 October 1965 Couve de Murville, in the National Assembly, pushed for a revision of the treaties; this was opposed by the other five member states. At the Council meeting of 25 to 26 October, they passed a resolution stating that a solution &quot;must be found within the provisions of the existing treaties&quot;. As a compromise, however, they offered the possibility of an extraordinary meeting of the council to discuss &quot;the general situation of the Community&quot; – without the Commission being invited.
Following the French presidential elections on 5 and 19 December 1965, de Gaulle accepted this offer. In the negotiations on 17/18 January 1966, the French foreign minister, Couve de Murville, dropped the more extreme of France&#x27;s demands.
In January 1966, the six foreign ministers agreed to suggest to the Commission that the Permanent Representatives of the ministers should be consulted before making any major proposals and not to publish such proposals before they had been dealt with by the Council of Ministers. The other five took note of – but did not formally accept – the opinion of the French delegation that for matters of very important national interest, the discussion should continue until a unanimous agreement was reached.

This became known as the Luxembourg Compromise.
It was not specified what could be invoked as a national interest and how to resolve disputes, so majority decisions were avoided and – until it was abolished by the Single European Act – it became a &quot;de facto&quot; veto, requiring unanimity for Council decisions.
Some concessions were also made to French sensibilities; for instance, diplomats no longer presented their credentials to Hallstein alone but jointly to the presidents of the Commission and the council.

When the &quot;Empty Chair Crisis&quot; was finally resolved, it had lasted from 30 June 1965 to 29 January 1966.

When the French foreign minister Couve de Murville returned to the negotiating table after Hallstein&#x27;s official term of office in January 1966, he insisted on Hallstein&#x27;s departure and the nomination of someone else to be the head of the new Commission, which would in future be the Commission shared by all three communities when the EEC, the ECSC, and Euratom were merged.

Since there was no agreement on a replacement for Hallstein when his term ended on 8 January 1966, he remained in office as a caretaker (based on Article 159 of the EEC Treaty). This also meant that the planned merger of the three communities, which was to have taken place on 1 January 1966, was postponed.
In view of the confrontation with de Gaulle, there was a proposal that Hallstein should be nominated for a further term but that he should serve for only six months. The German Chancellor, Georg Kiesinger agreed to this compromise, but Hallstein considered this was a breach of the Treaty and on 5 May 1967 he asked not to be re-nominated at all.

In this way, the national governments had refused to accept the Commission becoming a European executive, blocking Hallstein&#x27;s vision of a United States of Europe.

====Issues behind confrontation with de Gaulle====

De Gaulle recognized Hallstein&#x27;s service to European integration but attributed it to German patriotism, serving the interests of Germany, enabling Germany to re-attain respect and status in Europe that it had lost because of Hitler. De Gaulle resented the status that Hallstein, for him a mere technocrat, was accorded by foreign states. Hallstein, for his part, was watchful that, as representative of the Commission, he was accorded the status normally accorded to a head of state. De Gaulle complained of the Commission usurping a political role reserved for governments and of Hallstein usurping a role reserved for heads of government or heads of state; he attacked Hallstein personally saying that Hallstein was trying to turn the EEC into a superstate, with Brussels as its capital; he talked of defending French democracy against an unaccountable and stateless technocracy, &quot;a technocratic Areopagus, stateless and unaccountable&quot; [De Gaulle at a press conference at the Élysée Palace on 9 September 1965.]
In his memoirs, de Gaulle wrote of Hallstein 
According to &quot;, de Gaulle&#x27;s complaints included 
* Hallstein&#x27;s being frequently received by US presidents, although the Commission had no foreign relations mandate;
* Hallstein&#x27;s claim to be a sort of European prime minister;
* the rank of ambassador held by the representatives of the 65 states accredited with the European Commission;
* foreign ambassadors&#x27; presentation of their credentials to Hallstein (ambassadors normally present their credentials, signed by the country&#x27;s head of state to the head of state of the host country);
* the participation of Commission staff in the Kennedy Round negotiations in Geneva, in negotiations with EFTA, and in negotiations with non-European states, in particular South American states.

On the political role of the Commission, Hallstein stated in an interview with &quot; 

The issue that triggered the Empty Chair Crisis was the financing of the common agricultural policy, which was of critical interest to France: from 1962 to 1964, France had received 46 million US dollars from the agricultural fund, eighty-five per cent of all revenue.

The clash between Hallstein and de Gaulle demonstrated a clash between two opposing visions of Europe.
The differences included:
* the debate on the inclusion of the United Kingdom
* the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy
* the rights of the European Parliament, especially with respect to the budget
* majority voting in the Council of Ministers.
On most of these issues, de Gaulle regarded Hallstein as an opponent. Hallstein&#x27;s response to de Gaulle&#x27;s attacks was also somewhat confrontational, comparing de Gaulle&#x27;s actions with those of Hitler.

==Later life (1967–1982)==
Hallstein left the Commission at the end of 1967, aged 68.
On 20 January 1968, Hallstein was elected president of the &quot;European Movement&quot;, a private organization founded in 1948 as the umbrella organization of various organizations in favour of European integration, where he continued to promote his vision of a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;. Hallstein retained this office until 1974, when he did not stand for re-election, being followed by Jean Rey, who had also succeeded him as President of the Commission.
In the run-up to the federal elections in 1969, Helmut Kohl, then minister-president and head of the CDU in the state of Rhineland Palatinate offered Hallstein the opportunity of standing as a direct candidate in the Neuwied constituency in the Westerwald area and heading up the CDU party list in the state of Rhineland Palatinate. At the time, the CDU under Kurt Georg Kiesinger was the governing party. At the CDU &quot;Euroforum 68&quot; congress in Saarbrücken in January 1968, Hallstein was celebrated as the future foreign minister, should the CDU win the 1969 federal election. He proposed to confront de Gaulle and counter his attempts to &quot;devalue&quot; and &quot;weaken&quot; the European Community. However, the party lost the election, leaving Hallstein as a member of the Bundestag, but with no government office.

As reported by &quot;&quot;, Hallstein was later approached by Kohl as a possible candidate to replace Heinrich Lübke as Federal President, but this did not come to fruition. From 1969 to 1972, he was a member of the German Federal Parliament for the Christian Democratic Union, where he was on the Foreign Affairs Committee and was one of the party&#x27;s spokesmen for European affairs, along with Erik Blumenfeld and Carl-Ludwig Wagner. In the party, he supported the Junge Union, the CDU youth organization. Hallstein had little personal contact with his constituency, the work being done mainly by his assistant Christian Franck. At the next elections in 1972, he was not re-nominated. In his speeches in the Bundestag, he continued to express his vision of the European Union. He also spoke out in favour of direct election of the European Parliament in Germany. At that time, the members of the European Parliament were delegated by the Bundestag, and a direct election was not introduced until 1979.
Having left the Bundestag in 1972 and the presidency of the European Movement in 1974, Hallstein retired from active political life but continued to write and give talks. He moved from his country house in the Westerwald to Stuttgart and continued his work as an author.

Hallstein fell ill in early 1980 and died in Stuttgart on 29 March 1982, at the age of 80. He was buried, following a state funeral, on 2 April 1982 at the Waldfriedhof Cemetery in Stuttgart.

Hallstein remained a bachelor all his life.

==Vision of Europe==
Central to Hallstein&#x27;s ideas on Europe was his vision of a federal Europe. He called European integration a &quot;revolutionary endeavour&quot; that would take a long time. According to Hallstein&#x27;s analysis of the situation, European integration was favoured by the external threat from the Soviet bloc and the internal threat of conflict between the states of central and western Europe and the political and economic fragility of some European democracies.
Hallstein and his staff at the Foreign Office aimed for a constitutional framework in the federalist sense – a supranational concept that was opposed by the school centred around Ludwig Erhard and the Ministry of Economics, who advocated intergovernmental, economic cooperation, founded on free trade.

Hallstein spoke early in favour of the proposed European Defence Community, which never came to fruition, and of West German&#x27;s integration in the West, which he saw as necessary for the solution of other problems, including German reunification.

In a speech in 1953, in London, Hallstein talked of three &quot;dimensions&quot; of European integration:
* &quot;Intensity&quot; expressed the degree to which member states give up individual sovereignty to create a supranational community.
* &quot;Extensity&quot; expressed the size of the community, that is the number of member states.
* &quot;Time&quot; expressed the order and speed of steps toward complete integration.
He spoke of a trade-off between the different dimensions, for instance: the larger the number of members, the less integration would be possible in a given time. His model included the coexistence of different European organizations of differing sizes and with differing degrees of integration. Such considerations were particularly relevant to the United Kingdom, which had been more in favour of intergovernmental organizations such as the Council of Europe and had shown less interest in supranational organizations like the European Coal and Steel Community and the proposed European Defence Community.

Though Hallstein first pursued the goal of economic integration, he stated that this was not an end in itself but was a means of achieving a political union that &quot;pool[ed] all the appropriate functions of the member-states. For Hallstein the Schuman Plan was a way for Europe to become an equal partner of the United States – and as a way for Germany to &quot;rejoin the organized community of free peoples&quot;.
He envisaged a planned, gradual evolution involving a number of projects, coming together to produce a coherent whole. At first he talked of the &quot;dynamic aspect of the constituent plans&quot; (&quot;&quot;), but later of what he – or rather his unenviable translator – called &quot;material logic&quot; (, an &quot;anonymous force [that] only works through human will ... [an] inner logic, which is stronger than the capricious dictates of politics&quot;).
This meant setting up a situation in such a way that the desired goal would be achieved because people faced with future problems and choices would naturally choose the desired path – not automatically, but because the inherent logic of the situation would favour the desired choice. For instance, installing common tariffs would naturally lead to the need for a common trade policy; prescribing free movement for people, services, and capital would tend to lead to a common infrastructure, including a common tax policy, a common budgetary policy, and a common currency.

The Schuman Plan was the first step, applied to the field of economics; the next step was to be defence; these would then &quot;necessarily&quot; lead to integration in the related fields of industrial relations and social policy, energy policy and foreign policy.
Hallstein strove for a Europe based on the rule of law (&quot;law in place of force&quot;). His concept of European Union was that of a &quot;community&quot; based on democracy and the rule of law — not a federation (because it was not yet a state), nor a confederation (&quot;because it was endowed with the power of exercising authority directly over every citizen in each of its member states&quot;).

A lawyer and an expert in international law, Hallstein saw a strong legal foundation as essential. His model of a federal Europe borrowed from the federal structures of Germany, the United States and Switzerland.
Hallstein later wrote that the experience of Nazi Germany led him to distrust not only the idea of absolute and inalienable national sovereignty but also the British idea of a European balance of power. Partly as a result of the Americans&#x27; re-education programme, Hallstein developed an interest in the United States Constitution and American history between independence in 1776 and the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, when the United States was a confederation of states. The problems that the United States experienced were, in his view, due partly to the states defending their sovereignty. He rejected the concept of the unitary nation-state favoured by the French, in favour of a federal solution, and concluded that Europe should follow the American path towards a federal solution. However, he wished to retain Europe&#x27;s diversity and opposed the idea of Europe becoming a &quot;melting pot&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
People who knew Hallstein described him as someone with a keen intellect, an excellent command of language, and high reliability. But he was also perceived by those who knew him as cold, unapproachable, and excessively intellectual, respected rather than liked. British Prime Minister Edward Heath allegedly said of him &quot;He is just a brain&quot;. He was also characterized as having a keen sense of duty: Franz Josef Strauss called him one of the last Prussians.
During his lifetime, Walter Hallstein received honorary doctorates from nine European universities, including Padua, Sussex, Liège, Nancy, Leuven, Oviedo, and Tübingen, and nine American universities, including Georgetown, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins University.

He was also awarded numerous other honours and prizes from European governments.

In 1997, the Walter Hallstein Institute for European Constitutional Law at the Humboldt University in Berlin was named in his honour.

==Works==
The documented total number of publications by Hallstein exceeds 365.

Hallstein&#x27;s major popular work was &quot;Der unvollendete Bundesstaat&quot; [The Unfinished Federation], which was first published in 1969: 
This book can be seen as Hallstein&#x27;s political testament. The second German edition was titled simply &quot;Die Europäische Gemeinschaft&quot; [&quot;The European Community&quot;]:
A later version was published in English with the title &quot;Europe in the Making&quot;:
He also wrote a number of academic books and numerous articles, and he gave innumerable speeches. Some of his speeches were published as a book:

<text>Johann von Robais, [[Freiherr|Baron]] de Kalb (June 19, 1721 – August 19, 1780), born Johann Kalb, was a Franconian-born French military officer who served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was mortally wounded while fighting against the British Army during the Battle of Camden.

==Early life and education==
Kalb was born in Hüttendorf, a German village near Erlangen, Principality of Bayreuth, the son of Johann Leonhard Kalb and Margarethe Seitz. He learned French, English, and the social skills to earn a substantial military commission in the Loewendal German Regiment of the French Army in 1743.

==Career==
Kalb served with distinction in the War of the Austrian Succession in Flanders. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made assistant quartermaster general in the Army of the Upper Rhine, a division created by the disbanding of the Loewendal Regiment. He was awarded the Order of Military Merit in 1763 and elevated to the nobility with the title of baron&quot;.&quot;

In 1764, Kalb resigned from the army and married Anna Elizabeth Emilie van Robais, the French heiress to a fortune from cloth manufacturing. He bought the &quot;Milon-la-Chapelle&quot; chateau near Versailles, where he took up a quiet life of farming. He had three children: Élie, Frederic, and Caroline; Eli later married Elise Signard d&#x27;Ouffières and have a daughter, Nicette de Kalb, who married Raymond de Vandière de Vitrac d&#x27;Abzac, and continued to live in Milon la Chapelle; Frederic would die during the French Revolution without children.

In 1768, Kalb traveled to North America on a covert mission from the Duc de Choiseul, the Foreign Minister of France, to determine the level of discontent among colonists towards Great Britain, a major French adversary. During his four-month trip, Kalb gained respect for the colonists and their &quot;spirit of independence&quot;, producing detailed reports for the French government; upon his return to Europe, he expressed a strong desire to go back to colonial America and join their nascent fight against the British.

===American Revolutionary War===
In July 1777, Kalb returned to North America with his protégé, the Marquis de Lafayette, and joined the Continental Army. He was disappointed and angry to learn that he would not be made a major general, but with Lafayette&#x27;s influence was appointed to the rank on September 5, 1777, which he learned of as he was on the road to return to France.

Kalb was at Valley Forge for most of the winter between 1777 and 1778, commanding a division of Patterson&#x27;s and Learned&#x27;s Brigades. During this time, he wrote letters of introduction for John Adams to the French court, expressing a poor opinion of French forces:

On the whole, I have annoyances to bear, of which you can hardly form a conception. One of them is the mutual jealousy of almost all the French officers, particularly against those of higher rank than the rest. These people think of nothing but their incessant intrigues and backbitings. They hate each other like the bitterest enemies, and endeavor to injure each other wherever an opportunity offers. I have given up their society, and very seldom see them. La Fayette is the sole exception; I always meet him with the same cordiality and the same pleasure. He is an excellent young man, and we are good friends ... La Fayette is much liked, he is on the best of terms with Washington.

Kalb was assigned to command a division of Maryland and Delaware troops, and he was ordered south to the Carolinas in command of these reinforcements. During the British southern campaign, he was disappointed to learn that Horatio Gates had been appointed to command instead of him. Gates led the army to a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780. De Kalb&#x27;s horse was shot from under him, causing him to tumble to the ground. Before he could get up, he was shot three times and bayonetted repeatedly by British soldiers. His friend and aide, the Chevalier du Buysson, was seriously wounded blocking additional blows with his own body.

Upon seeing Kalb, Cornwallis told him, &quot;I am sorry, sir, to see you, not sorry that you are vanquished, but sorry to see you so badly wounded.&quot; It is reported that Cornwallis supervised the dressing of Kalb&#x27;s wounds by his own surgeons in Camden, South Carolina. As he lay dying, Kalb was reported to have said to a British officer, &quot;I thank you sir for your generous sympathy, but I die the death I always prayed for: the death of a soldier fighting for the rights of man.&quot; He died three days later.

Upon visiting de Kalb&#x27;s grave several years after his death, George Washington is reported to have said:

==Legacy==

De Kalb was greatly revered by his contemporaries and is still regarded as a hero of the American Revolution. Numerous towns and counties in the U.S. bear his name, including in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Texas. Streets include DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn, New York City, and Merrick, New York, DeKalb Pike (U.S. Route 202) between King of Prussia and Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania, and others. 

In Brooklyn, New York, the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal order, established the Baron DeKalb Council #1073 in 1906. His portrait was painted posthumously by Charles Willson Peale, who was best known for his paintings of leading figures of the American Revolution. In 1886, a monument to Kalb was erected on the grounds of the Maryland state house to honor his contributions to the American Revolution.

Two warships of the U.S. Navy were named after him: the Civil War river ironclad USS &quot;Baron DeKalb&quot; and the World War I troop transport USS &quot;DeKalb&quot;.

An American elementary school run by the U.S. Department of Defense in Nuremberg, Germany was named for him; it closed in the 1990s. Since 2006, the Major General Baron DeKalb Army Reserve Center hosts the headquarters of the 200th Military Police Command at Fort Meade, Maryland.

In Camden, South Carolina, outside the Revolutionary War Visitor Center, is a statue of de Kalb to commemorate his bravery in the Battle of Camden.

<text>Rising Force is the first studio album by guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, released in late 1984 through Polydor Records. This was originally planned as an instrumental side-project of his then-current band Alcatrazz, but due to singer Jeff Scott Soto&#x27;s appearance on the album, Malmsteen opted to release it as a solo album. It reached No. 14 on the Swedish albums chart and No. 60 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and received a nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1986 Grammy Awards. The album is regarded as a landmark release in the shred and neoclassical metal genres.

==Critical reception==
Steve Huey at AllMusic gave &quot;Rising Force&quot; four stars out of five, calling it &quot;a revelation upon its release&quot; and &quot;The true inauguration of the age of the guitar shredder.&quot; He praised Malmsteen&#x27;s technique and &quot;blinding virtuosity&quot;, as well as highlighting his &quot;obsessions with Bach, Beethoven, and Paganini&quot;.

In a 2009 article by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, &quot;Rising Force&quot; was ranked first in the all-time top ten list of shred albums. The staff wrote: &quot;Yngwie J. Malmsteen was, is, and always will be the greatest shredder of all time. Hell, he invented the genre with his 1985 debut.&quot;

&quot;Black Star&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond the Sun&quot; have endured as two of Malmsteen&#x27;s most popular songs, as well as being staples of his live setlist. In a 2008 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, Malmsteen said of the two songs: &quot;I&#x27;ll probably play &#x27;Far Beyond the Sun&#x27; and &#x27;Black Star&#x27; until the day I die.&quot;

<doc id="241335" wikidata="Q1152009" url="?curid=241335" title="Either/Or (Kierkegaard book)">
<text>Either/Or (Danish: &quot;Enten – Eller&quot;) is the first published work of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. It appeared in two volumes in 1843 under the pseudonymous editorship of &quot;Victor Eremita&quot; (Latin for &quot;victorious hermit&quot;). It outlines a theory of human existence, marked by the distinction between an essentially hedonistic, aesthetic mode of life and the ethical life, which is predicated upon commitment.

&quot;Either/Or&quot; portrays two life views. Each life view is written and represented by a fictional author, with the prose reflecting and depending on the life view. The aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views are expressed as experiences embodied by the fictional authors. The book&#x27;s central concern is Aristotle&#x27;s primal question, &quot;How should we live?&quot; His motto comes from Plutarch, &quot;The deceived is wiser than one not deceived.&quot;

The aesthetic is the personal, subjective realm of existence, where an individual lives and extracts pleasure from life for its own sake. This realm offers the possibility of the highest and lowest experiences. The ethical, on the other hand, is the civic realm of existence, where value and identity are judged and at times superseded by the objective world. The choice is whether to remain oblivious to the outside world or to become involved. More specifically, the ethical realm starts with a conscious effort to choose one&#x27;s life. Either way it is possible to go too far in one direction and lose sight of the self. Only faith can rescue the individual from these two opposing realms. &quot;Either/Or&quot; concludes with a brief sermon hinting at the religious sphere of existence, which consumed most of Kierkegaard&#x27;s publishing career. Ultimately, his challenge is for the reader to &quot;discover a second face hidden behind the one you see&quot; internally, and then in others.

==Historical context==
After writing and defending his dissertation &quot;On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates&quot; (1841), Kierkegaard left Copenhagen in October 1841 to spend the winter in Berlin. His main purpose was to attend lectures by German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, an eminent figure at the time. The lectures disappointed many in Schelling&#x27;s audience, including Mikhail Bakunin and Friedrich Engels, while Kierkegaard described it as &quot;unbearable nonsense&quot;. During his stay, Kierkegaard worked on the manuscript for &quot;Either/Or&quot;, took daily lessons to perfect his German, and attended operas and plays, particularly by Mozart and Goethe. He returned to Copenhagen in March 1842 with a draft of the manuscript, which he completed late that year and published in February 1843.

According to a journal entry from 1846, &quot;Either/Or&quot; was written &quot;lock, stock, and barrel in eleven months&quot; (&quot;Rub og Stub, i 11 Maaneder&quot;), although a page from the &quot;Diapsalmata&quot; section in the &quot;A&quot; volume was written earlier.

The title &quot;Either/Or&quot; affirmed Aristotelian logic, particularly as modified by Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Immanuel Kant. Is the question, &quot;Who am I?&quot; a scientific question or one for the individual to answer?

Kierkegaard argues that Hegel&#x27;s philosophy dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the &quot;either/or&quot;. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel&#x27;s theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear through a natural process that requires no individual choice other than a submission to the Will of the Idea or &quot;Geist&quot;. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice.

==Structure==
The book is the first of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works written pseudonymously, a practice he employed during the first half of his career. In this case, he employed four pseudonyms:
*&quot;Victor Eremita&quot; - the fictional compiler and editor, which he claims to have found in an antique escritoire.
*&quot;A&quot; - the fictional author of the first text (&quot;Part I&quot;) by Victor Eremita, whose real name he claims not to have known.
* B &quot;Judge Vilhelm&quot; (or &quot;Wilhelm&quot; - &quot;William&quot;) - the fictional author of the second text (&quot;Part II&quot;).
*&quot;Johannes&quot; - the fictional author of a section of &quot;Part I&quot; titled &quot;The Diary of a Seducer&quot; and &quot;Cordelia&quot; his lover.

== Publication ==
Kierkegaard published the second edition of &quot;Either/Or&quot; on May 14, 1849, the same day he published &quot;The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air: Three Devotional Discourses&quot;. He published three books on the same day October 16, 1843.

==Part I==
The first part describes the &quot;aesthetic&quot; phase of existence. It contains a collection of papers, notionally found by &quot;Victor Eremita&quot; and written by &quot;A&quot;, the aesthete.

The aesthete, according to Kierkegaard, eventually falls into despair, a psychological state (explored further in Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot; and &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot;) that results from a recognition of the limits of the aesthetic approach to life. Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;despair&quot; is a somewhat analogous precursor of existential angst. The natural reaction is to make an eventual leap to the second phase, the ethical, which is characterized by rational choice and commitment that replace the capricious and inconsistent longings of the aesthetic mode.

===Diapsalmata===
The first section of Part I is a collection of tangential aphorisms, epigrams, anecdotes, and musings on the aesthetic mode. The word &quot;diapsalmata&quot; is related to &quot;psalms&quot;, and means &quot;refrains&quot;. It contains some of Kierkegaard&#x27;s best-known and poetic lines, such as &quot;What is a poet?&quot;, &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; vs. &quot;Freedom of Thought&quot;, the &quot;Unmovable chess piece&quot;, the tragic clown, and the laughter of the gods.

Reading these as written shows a constant movement from the outer poetic experience to the inner experience of humor. The movement from the outer to the inner is a theme in Kierkegaard&#x27;s works.

===Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic===
This essay discusses the idea that music expresses sensuality. &quot;A&quot; evaluates Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, as well as Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. &quot;A&quot; accepts the task of proving, through the works of Mozart, that &quot;music is a higher, or more spiritual art, than language&quot;. During this process, he offers three stages of the musical-erotic.

He distinguishes a seducer such as Don Juan, who falls under aesthetic categories, and Faust, who falls under ethical categories. &quot;The musical Don Juan enjoys the satisfaction of desire; the reflective Don Juan enjoys the deception, enjoys the cunning.&quot; Don Juan is split between the aesthetic and the ethical. He becomes lost in the multiplicity of the &quot;1,003 women he has to seduce&quot; (as in the famous &quot;aria&quot; &quot;Madamina, il catalogo è questo&quot;), Faust seduces just one woman.

This section deals with theological questions. &quot;A&quot; asks if God seduces 1,003 people at one time or if he seduces one individual at a time in order to make a believer. He writes: Achim v. Arnim tells somewhere of a seducer of a very different style, a seducer who falls under ethical categories. About him he uses an expression which in truth, boldness, and conciseness is almost equal to Mozart’s stroke of the bow. He says he could so talk with a woman that, if the devil caught him, he could wheedle himself out of it if he had a chance to talk with the devil’s grandmother. This is the real seducer; the aesthetic interest here is also different, namely: how, the method.

===Essays read before the Symparanekromenoi===

The next three sections are essay lectures from &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;symparanekromenoi&quot;, a club or fellowship of the dead who practice the art of writing posthumous papers.

The first essay, which discusses ancient and modern tragedy, is the &quot;Ancient Tragical Motif as Reflected in the Modern&quot;. He writes about tragedy&#x27;s inner and outer aspects. Can remorse be shown on a stage? What about sorrow and pain? Which is easier to portray? He also discusses guilt, sin, fear, compassion, and responsibility in what can be considered a foreshadowing of &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; and &quot;Repetition&quot;. He then writes a modern interpretation of &quot;Antigone&quot; that presages &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;.

The second essay, &quot;Shadowgraphs: A Psychological Pastime&quot;, discusses modern heroines, including Mozart&#x27;s Elvira and Goethe&#x27;s Gretchen (Margaret). He studies how desire can come to grief. He asks whether love can be deceived.

He is asking whether one person can reveal the inner life of a historical figure. Psychologically he is asking whether psychologists can give an accurate account of the inner world. Religiously he&#x27;s asking whether one person can accurately perceive the inner world of another. He conducts several thought experiments to attempt this.

The third essay, called &quot;The Unhappiest One&quot;, discusses the hypothetical question: &quot;who deserves the distinction of being unhappier than everyone else?&quot; Kierkegaard has expanded his search for the highest to a search for the lowest. He wants to find the unhappy person by looking to the past. Is it Niobe, Job, the father of the prodigal son, or Periander, Abraham or Christ?

Ultimately, for Kierkegaard, the aesthetical and the ethical are both superseded by a final phase which he terms the &quot;religious&quot; mode. This is introduced later in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;.

=== The First Love ===
In this volume, Kierkegaard examines the concept of &quot;First Love&quot; as a pinnacle for the aesthete, using his concepts of &quot;closedness&quot; (&quot;indesluttethed&quot; in Danish) and &quot;demonic&quot; (&quot;demoniske&quot;) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe wanted to create a template for all playwrights. He insisted that people value plays to escape reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard rejected any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing literature, because the system forces the artist to settle down within the system.

He wrote about the muse as the occasion for inspiration. He considers how much of the muse&#x27;s calling depends on the muse, how much on the individual, and how much on will/volition. Later in &quot;Concluding Unscientific Poscript&quot; he wrote; &quot;inspiration is indeed an object of faith, is qualitatively dialectical, not attainable by means of quantification.&quot;

Kierkegaard attacks reading about love instead of discovering love. Scribe&#x27;s play is 16 pages long leading Kierkegaard to write a 50-page review. He attacked the practice of reading reviews instead of the subject books.

He attends a performance and sees his lover at a play called &quot;First Love&quot;; for him this is a sign, like a four-leaf clover, that she must be the one. Confusion sets in for her because of mistaken identity. She is unable to make up her mind about love and says, &quot;The first love is the true love, and one loves only once.&quot; Kierkegaard rejects this as sophistry, &quot;because the category first, is at the same time a qualitative and a numerical category.&quot;

===Crop Rotation: An Attempt at a Theory of Social Prudence===
To Kierkegaard&#x27;s aesthete, boredom is the root of all evil, and must be avoided. In this section, &quot;A&quot; explains that, just as a farmer rotates crops to keep the soil fertile, so must a man continue to change in order to remain interesting. &quot;A&quot; speaks out against anything that may prevent this rotation and lock one into boredom, including friends, family, and most importantly for the second half of the book, marriage. 

===Diary of a Seducer===
Written by &quot;Johannes the Seducer&quot;, this volume illustrates how the aesthete holds the &quot;interesting&quot; as his highest value and that to satisfy his voyeuristic reflections, he manipulates the girl Cordelia into becoming interesting – he seduces her, but then schemes to have her question the idea of engagement. Finally, Johannes succeeds in having Cordelia break the engagement. He uses irony, artifice, caprice, imagination and arbitrariness to engineer poetically satisfying possibilities; he is not so much interested in the act of seduction as in willfully creating its interesting possibility.

The Seducer is reminiscent of &quot;Faust&quot; Part 1, Scene VII (A Street). Faust says to Mephistopheles, &quot;Listen, you must get that girl for me!&quot; Mephistopheles says she&#x27;s an &quot;innocent&quot; girl, but Faust says she&#x27;s &quot;older than 14&quot;. Mephistopheles says he&#x27;s &quot;speaking like some Don Juan&quot;. Faust then calls the devil a Master Moraliser. But Goethe may have been responding to Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; (1616); Goethe and Marlowe have devils and angels as third person or persons between him and his love, but Kierkegaard has a different third person involved in the discussions between Johannes the Seducer and Cordelia. He has this power called chance. The Seducer knows the value of chance and wants to use chance to be &quot;a possibility which seems an impossibility&quot;.

Kierkegaard had this seducer speak again in &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;, where he explored possibilities and then once more where he tried to explain that misunderstanding can be the root of the unity of the tragic and the comic:

Kierkegaard explores the category of choice and the aesthetic as well as the ethical. Both can choose to love each other but the &quot;how&quot; of love is Kierkegaard&#x27;s subject.

==Part II==
The second part represents the ethical stage. Eremita found a group of letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William (in Danish: &quot;Assessor Wilhelm&quot;), another pseudonymous author, to &quot;A&quot;, trying to convince &quot;A&quot; of the value of the ethical life by arguing that the ethical person can still appreciate aesthetic values. The difference is that the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities. Letters:

*&quot;The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage&quot;: This letter is about the aesthetic value of marriage and defends marriage as a way of life.
*&quot;Equilibrium between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Development of Personality&quot; concerns the subject of choosing the good, or one&#x27;s self, and of the value of making binding life-choices.
*&quot;Ultimatum&quot;: The volume ends in a discourse on the Thought that, against God everyone is always wrong. His spiritual advice for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is that they make peace with each other. Kierkegaard quotes from: the Gospel of Luke 19:42 NIV &quot;and said, &quot;If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace --but now it is hidden from your eyes.&quot; Sennacherib&#x27;s prism &quot;That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp When the people got up the next morning -- there were all the dead bodies!&quot; to the end for this discourse.

It is human nature to look to external forces when faced with obstacles, but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and has nothing to do with ethics and religion. He says, &quot;Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.&quot; He also asks if a someone in love can know whether they are more in love than another. He advances this thought in &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&quot; and expands on looking inward in &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. ... All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Works of Love&quot; (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement. Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;, 1850 p.157 Hong

It is unclear if Kierkegaard acknowledges an ethical stage without religion. Freedom seems to denote freedom to choose the will to do the right and to denounce the wrong in a secular, almost Kantian style. However, remorse (&quot;angeren&quot;) seems to be a religious category specifically related to the Christian concept of deliverance. Moreover, Kierkegaard is constant in his point of view that each individual can become conscious of a higher self and embrace the spiritual self in an &quot;eternal understanding&quot;. 

==Discourses and sequel==
Along with this work, Kierkegaard published, under his own name, &quot;Two Upbuilding Discourses&quot; on May 16, 1843, intended to complement &quot;Either/Or&quot;, &quot;The Expectancy of Faith&quot; and &quot;Every Good and Every Perfect Gift is from Above&quot;.

Kierkegaard also published another discourse during the printing of the second edition of &quot;Either/Or&quot; in 1849. This discourse has to do with the difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. &quot;As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle.&quot; Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to &quot;faith as the highest&quot; expectancy because faith is something everyone has, or can have. He says: &quot;The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all.&quot;

The characters in &quot;Either/Or&quot; believe everyone is alike in that everyone has talent or everyone has the conditions that would allow them to live an ethical life. Goethe wanted to love and complained that he couldn&#x27;t be loved, but everyone else could be. But he wished, he didn&#x27;t have an expectancy to work his will to love. Kierkegaard responds to him: 

The &quot;Ultimatum&quot; at the end of the second volume of &quot;Either/Or&quot; hinted at a future discussion of the religious stage in &quot;The Two Upbuilding Discourses&quot;, &quot;Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it-and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart’s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you-for only the truth that builds up is truth for you.&quot; This discussion is included in &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot; (1845). The first two sections revisit and refine the aesthetic and ethical stages elucidated in &quot;Either/Or&quot;, while the third section, &quot;Guilty/Not Guilty&quot; is about the religious stage and refers specifically to Goethe&#x27;s other book, &quot;The Autobiography of Goethe: Truth and Poetry, from My Own Life&quot; vol 1, 2

In addition to the discourses, one week after &quot;Either/Or&quot; was published, Kierkegaard published a newspaper article in &quot;Fædrelandet&quot;, titled &quot;Who Is the Author Of Either/Or?&quot;, attempting to create authorial distance from the work, emphasizing the content of the work and the embodiment of a particular way of life in each of the pseudonyms. Kierkegaard, using the pseudonym &quot;A.F.&quot;, writes, &quot;most people, including the author of this article, think it is not worth the trouble to be concerned about who the author is. They are happy not to know his identity, for then they have only the book to deal with, without being bothered or distracted by his personality.&quot;

==Themes==

The various essays in &quot;Either/Or&quot; help clarify the various forms of aestheticism and ethical existence. Both A and Judge Vilhelm attempt to focus primarily upon the best that their mode of existence has to offer.

A fundamental characteristic of the aesthete is &quot;immediacy&quot;. In &quot;Either/Or&quot;, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments that do not require effort or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The &quot;theory&quot; of social prudence given in &quot;Crop Rotation&quot; is an example of refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and &quot;cultivated&quot; for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. If things go wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one&#x27;s self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to &quot;Either/Or&quot;, &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Commitment is an important characteristic of the ethicist. Commitments are made by being an active participant in society, rather than a detached observer or outsider. The ethicist has a strong sense of responsibility, duty, honor and respect for his friendships, family, and career. Judge Vilhelm uses the example of marriage as an example of an ethical institution requiring strong commitment and responsibility. Whereas the aesthete would be bored by the repetitive nature of marriage (e.g. married to one person only), the ethicist believes in the necessity of self-denial (e.g. self-denying unmitigated pleasure) in order to uphold one&#x27;s obligations.

Kierkegaard stresses the &quot;eternal&quot; nature of marriage and says &quot;something new comes into existence&quot; through the wedding ceremony. The aesthete doesn&#x27;t see it that way. The aesthete makes a &quot;half hour’s resolution&quot; but the ethical person, and especially the religious person, makes the &quot;good resolution&quot;. Someone devoted to pleasure finds it impossible to make this kind of resolution. The ethical and &quot;Christian religious&quot; person make the resolution because they have the &quot;will&quot; to have &quot;a true conception of life and of oneself&quot;.&quot; A resolution involves change but for the single individual this involves only change in oneself. It never means changing the whole world or even changing the other person.

==Interpretation==
The extremely nested pseudonymity of this work adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are the authors of the work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard&#x27;s role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms&quot; bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Papers&quot; first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. He discussed Either/Or in first and second edition in his 1848, 1859 book &quot;The Point of View of My Work as an Author&quot;. In my career as an author, a point has now been reached where it is permissible to do what I feel a strong impulse to do and so regard as my duty — namely, to explain once for all, as directly and frankly as possible, what is what: what I as an author declare myself to be. The moment (however unpropitious it may be in another sense) is now appropriate; partly because (as I have said) this point has been reached, and partly because I am about to encounter for the second time in the literary field my first production. 
&quot;Either/Or,&quot; in its second edition, which I was not willing to have published earlier. Point of View, Lowrie translation 1962 p. 5

Furthermore, Kierkegaard was a close reader of the aesthetic works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the ethical works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Each presented a way of living one&#x27;s life in a different manner. Kierkegaard&#x27;s writings in this book are close to what Goethe wrote in his Autobiography.

===Existential interpretation===
A common interpretation of &quot;Either/Or&quot; presents the reader with a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted the idea that there is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm&#x27;s ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one&#x27;s choices, one creates what one is.

However, the aesthetic and the ethical ways of life are not the only ways of living. Kierkegaard continues to flesh out other stages in further works, and the &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot; is considered a direct sequel to &quot;Either/Or&quot;. It is not the same as &quot;Either/Or&quot; as he points out in &quot;Concluding Postscript&quot; in 1846.

===Christian interpretation===
The whole book can be viewed as the struggle individuals go through as they attempt to find meaning in their lives. Victor Eremita bought a secretary (desk), which was something external, and said, &quot;a new period of your life must begin with the acquisition of the secretary&quot;. 
&quot;A&quot; desires the absolute highest. He can find no meaning in his life until he begins to study. He writes letters for the dead like the historians do. He&#x27;s trying to find God by studying the past as Hegel did. Don Juan seduces him away from God and Faust robs him of his innocent faith through the power of language. For him, tautology is the highest realm of thought. He&#x27;s someone who is in complete &quot;conflict with his environment&quot; because he is relating himself to externals.

&quot;B&quot; argues with &quot;A&quot;. He says ethics are the highest. &quot;A&quot; wants to remain a mystery to himself but &quot;B&quot; says it&#x27;s the meaning of life to become open to yourself. It&#x27;s more important to know yourself than historical persons. The more you know about yourself the more you can find your eternal validity. God will bless the most ethical person. Each one knows what&#x27;s best for the other but neither knows what&#x27;s best for himself.

Kierkegaard, speaking in the voice of the upbuilding discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They&#x27;re both trying to find God in a childish way. Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma, and ethics constantly change. We all want to be in the right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn&#x27;t what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.

A recent way to interpret &quot;Either/Or&quot; is to read it as an applied Kantian text. Scholars for this interpretation include Alasdair MacIntyre and Ronald M. Green. In &quot;After Virtue&quot;, MacIntyre claims Kierkegaard is continuing the Enlightenment project set forward by Hume and Kant. Green notes several points of contact with Kant in &quot;Either/Or&quot;:

However, other scholars think Kierkegaard adopts Kantian themes in order to criticize them, while yet others think that although Kierkegaard adopts some Kantian themes, their final ethical positions are substantially different. George Stack argues for this latter interpretation, writing, &quot;Despite the occasional echoes of Kantian sentiments in Kierkegaard&#x27;s writings (especially in &quot;Either/Or&quot;), the bifurcation between his ethics of self-becoming and Kant&#x27;s formalistic, meta-empirical ethics is, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, complete ... Since radical individuation, specificity, inwardness, and the development of subjectivity are central to Kierkegaard&#x27;s existential ethics, it is clear, essentially, that the spirit and intention of his practical ethics is divorced from the formalism of Kant.&quot;

===Biographical interpretation===
From a purely literary and historical point of view, &quot;Either/Or&quot; can be seen as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fiancée Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in &quot;The Diary of a Seducer&quot; treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. &quot;Either/Or&quot;, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard&#x27;s decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, &quot;Either/Or&quot; stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard&#x27;s life.

Yet, Kierkegaard was concerned about Regine because she tended to assume the life view of characters she saw in the plays of Shakespeare at the theater. One day she would be &quot;Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot;&quot; and another Juliet.

==Reception==

===Early reception===
&quot;Either/Or&quot; established Kierkegaard&#x27;s reputation as a respected author. Henriette Wulff, in a letter to Hans Christian Andersen, wrote, &quot;Recently a book was published here with the title &quot;Either/Or&quot;! It is supposed to be quite strange, the first part full of Don Juanism, skepticism, et cetera, and the second part toned down and conciliating, ending with a sermon that is said to be quite excellent. The whole book attracted much attention. It has not yet been discussed publicly by anyone, but it surely will be. It is actually supposed to be by a Kierkegaard who has adopted a pseudonym...&quot;

Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a prominent Hegelian, at first criticized the aesthetic section, &quot;Either&quot; (Part I), then he had much better things to say about &quot;Or&quot;, Part II. Julia Watkin said &quot;Kierkegaard replied to Heiberg in &quot;The Fatherland&quot; as Victor Eremita, blaming Heiberg for not reading the preface to Either/Or which would have given him the key to the work.&quot; Kierkegaard later used his book &quot;Prefaces&quot; to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard also published a short article, &quot;Who is the Author of Either/Or?&quot;, a week after the publication of &quot;Either/Or&quot; itself.

In 1886, Georg Brandes compared &quot;Either/Or&quot; with Frederik Paludan-Müller&#x27;s &quot;Kalanus&quot; in &quot;Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, which was translated into English at that time. Later, in 1906, he compared Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Diary of the Seducer&quot; with Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, or the New Heloise&quot; and with Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;. He also compared &quot;Either/Or&quot; to Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Brand&quot; but Edmund Gosse disagreed with him.

Kierkegaard later referred to his concept of choosing yourself as the single individual in &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;, June 17, 1844, and then in his &quot;&quot;, August 31, 1844, and once again in &quot;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&quot;, 1847. William James echoed Kierkegaard in his lecture on &quot;The Sick Soul&quot; where he wrote, &quot;the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life.&quot;
August Strindberg was familiar with &quot;Either/Or&quot; and this book made him &quot;forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful to the idea that art and knowledge must be subservient to life, and that life itself must be lived as we know best, chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings.&quot; Strindberg was obviously attracted to &quot;Either/Or Part II&quot; where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in &quot;Growth of a Soul&quot; published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Either—Or&quot;: &quot;it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and &quot;Don Juan&quot; were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination&quot;. Part II was his &quot;Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he reached the end of the work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine.&quot; He then states that Kierkegaard&#x27;s discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn&#x27;t know if he could come back to something &quot;which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire&quot;. However, after reading the book he &quot;felt sinful&quot;.

Kierkegaard put an end to his own double-mindedness about devoting himself completely to aesthetics or developing a balance between the aesthetic and the ethical and going on to an ethical/Christian religious existence in the first part of his authorship (1843-1846) and then described what he had learned about himself and about being a Christian beginning with &quot;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&quot; (1847). He learned to choose his own Either/Or. 

===Later reception===
Although &quot;Either/Or&quot; , published in 1843, was Kierkegaard&#x27;s first major book, it was one of his last books to be translated into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: &quot;In general, we have a right to discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as &quot;Either/Or&quot;, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author&#x27;s later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard&#x27;s brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure&quot;.

David F. Swenson, a professor at the University of Minnesota, introduced three lectures about Kierkegaard in 1918 in which he &quot;presented Soren Kierkegaard’s delineation of three fundamental modes of life: First, the Life of Enjoyment – Folly and Cleverness in the Pursuit of Pleasure; second, the Life of Duty – Realizing the Self through Victorious Accomplishments; third, the Life of Faith – The Religious Transformation of the Self through Suffering.

Miguel de Unamuno published his 1914 novel Mist in response to his reading of Kierkegaard&#x27;s Diary of a Seducer.

Thomas Henry Croxall was impressed by &quot;A&quot;″s thoughts on music in the essay, &quot;The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic&quot;. Croxall argues that &quot;the essay should be taken seriously by a musician because it makes one think, and think hard enough to straighten many of one&#x27;s ideas; ideas, I mean, not only on art, but on life&quot; and goes on to discuss the psychological, existential, and musical value of the work.

Reinhold Niebuhr questioned Kierkegaard&#x27;s emphasis in his pastoral epistle at the end of Or. He wrote the following in 1949. 

Johannes Edouard Hohlenberg wrote a biography about Søren Kierkegaard in 1954 and in that book he speculated that the &quot;Diary of the Seducer&quot; was meant to depict the life of P.L. Moller who later (1845) wrote the articles in &quot;The Corsair&quot; detrimental to the character of Kierkegaard. The &quot;Diary of a Seducer&quot; by itself, is a provocative novella, and has been reproduced separately from &quot;Either/Or&quot; several times. John Updike said of the &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;In the vast literature of love, &quot;The Seducer&#x27;s Diary&quot; is an intricate curiosity – a feverishly intellectual attempt to reconstruct an erotic failure as a pedagogic success, a wound masked as a boast&quot;.

Many authors were interested in separating the esthetic, the ethical and the religious but it may have been, as far as Kierkegaard was concerned, of more importance for the single individual to have a way to decide when one was becoming dominant over the other two. Henrik Stangerup, (1937–1998) a Danish writer, wrote three books as a way to illustrate Kierkegaard&#x27;s three stages of existence, 1981, &quot;The Road to Lagoa Santa&quot;, which was about Kierkegaard&#x27;s brother-in-law Peter Wilhelm Lund (the ethicist), 1985 &quot;The Seducer: It Is Hard to Die in Dieppe&quot;, Peder Ludvig Moller was the esthetic in that novel, and in 1991 &quot;Brother Jacob&quot; which describes Søren Kierkegaard as a Franciscan friar.
In contemporary times, &quot;Either/Or&quot; received new life as a grand philosophical work with the publication of Alasdair MacIntyre&#x27;s &quot;After Virtue&quot; (1981), where MacIntyre situates &quot;Either/Or&quot; as an attempt to capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. &quot;After Virtue&quot; renewed &quot;Either/Or&quot; as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre&#x27;s accusation in &quot;Kierkegaard After MacIntyre&quot;.

<doc id="241342" wikidata="Q216589" url="?curid=241342" title="24-hour clock">
<text>The modern 24-hour clock is the convention of timekeeping in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours. This is indicated by the hours (and minutes) passed since midnight, from to , with as an option to indicate the end of the day. This system, as opposed to the 12-hour clock, is the most commonly used time notation in the world today, and is used by the international standard ISO 8601.

A number of countries, particularly English speaking, use the 12-hour clock, or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of medicine, the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient&#x27;s medical history.

== Description ==


A time of day is written in the 24-hour notation in the form hh:mm (for example 01:23) or hh:mm:ss (for example, 01:23:45), where hh (00 to 23) is the number of full hours that have passed since midnight, mm (00 to 59) is the number of full minutes that have passed since the last full hour, and ss (00 to 59) is the number of seconds since the last full minute. To indicate the exact end of the day, hh may take the value 24, with mm and ss taking the value 00. In the case of a leap second, the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, ISO 8601).

Where subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a decimal fraction; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the colon, which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the dot on the line as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including some computer protocols and military time), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, &quot;2359&quot;.

=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===

In the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00 or 0:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date — that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.

The notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. &quot;00:00–24:00&quot;, &quot;07:00–24:00&quot;). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.

While the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. Style guides and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead. Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided. In variance with this, an older version of the correspondence manual for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps specified 0001 to 2400. The manual was updated in June 2015 to use 0000 to 2359.

=== Times after 24:00 ===

Time-of-day notations beyond 24:00 (such as 24:01 or 25:00 instead of 00:01 or 01:00) are not commonly used and not covered by the relevant standards. However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling. The GTFS public transport schedule listings file format has the concept of service days and expects times beyond 24:00 for trips that run after midnight.

=== Computer support ===
In most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, Microsoft Windows and macOS activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of specific language and region settings. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. POSIX programs such as ls default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.

=== Military time ===

In American English, the term &quot;military time&quot; is a synonym for the 24-hour clock. In the US, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; distinguishing the two diurnal repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the ambiguities of the 12-hour notation are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.

Military usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces, differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:
*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example &quot;0340Z&quot;).
*Leading zeros are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43 a.m. is spoken &quot;zero five forty-three&quot; (casually) or &quot;zero five four three&quot; (military radio), as opposed to &quot;five forty-three&quot; or &quot;five four three&quot;.
*Military time zones are lettered and given word designations from the NATO phonetic alphabet. For example, in US Eastern Standard Time (UTC−5), which is designated time zone R, 2:00 a.m. is written &quot;0200R&quot; and spoken &quot;zero two hundred Romeo&quot;.
*Local time is designated as zone J or &quot;Juliett&quot;. &quot;1200J&quot; (&quot;twelve hundred Juliett&quot;) is noon local time.
*Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called &quot;Zulu time&quot;. (When used as a modern time zone, in practice, GMT and UTC coincide. For other purposes there may be a difference of about a second.)
*Hours are always &quot;hundred&quot;, never &quot;thousand&quot;; 1000 is &quot;ten hundred&quot; not &quot;one thousand&quot;; 2000 is &quot;twenty hundred&quot; not &quot;two thousand&quot;.

== History ==
The first mechanical public clocks introduced in Italy were mechanical 24-hour clocks which counted the 24 hours of the day from one-half hour after sunset to the evening of the following day. The 24th hour was the last hour of day time.

From the 14th to the 17th century, two systems of time measurement competed in Europe:
* Italian (Bohemian, Old-Bohemian) hours (full-dial): 24 hours system with the day starting after sunset; on the static dial, the 24th hour was on the right side. In Italy, it was prevalently modified to a 4×6 hours system, but some 24-hour dials lasted until the 19th century. The system has spread especially to the Alpine countries, Czech countries and Poland. In Bohemia, this system was finally banned in 1621 after the defeat on White Mountain. The Prague Astronomical Clock struck according to the Old Bohemian Clock until its destruction in 1945. The variant with counting from dawn is also rarely documented and used, e.g. on a 16th-century cabinet clock in the Vienna Art-History Museum.
* German (Gallic) hours (half-dial): 2×12 hour system starting at midnight and restarted at noon. It is typical with the 12-hour dial with 12 at the top. 
The modern 24-hour system is a late-19th century adaptation of the German midnight-starting system, and then prevailed in the world with the exception of some Anglophone countries.

Striking clocks had to produce 300 strokes each day, which required a lot of rope, and wore out the mechanism quickly, so some localities switched to ringing sequences of 1 to 12 twice (156 strokes), or even 1 to 6 repeated four times (84 strokes).

Sandford Fleming, the engineer-in-chief of the Canadian Intercolonial Railway, was an early proponent of using the 24-hour clock as part of a programme to reform timekeeping, which also included establishing time zones and a standard prime meridian. At the International Meridian Conference in 1884, the following resolution was adopted by the conference:

The Canadian Pacific Railway was among the first organisations to adopt the 24-hour clock, at midsummer 1886. A report by a government committee in the United Kingdom noted Italy as the first country among those mentioned to adopt 24-hour time nationally, in 1893. Other European countries followed: France adopted it in 1912 (the French army in 1909), followed by Denmark (1916), and Greece (1917). By 1920, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Switzerland had switched, followed by Turkey (1925), and Germany (1927). By the early 1920s, many countries in Latin America had also adopted the 24-hour clock. Some of the railways in India had switched before the outbreak of the war.

During World War I, the British Royal Navy adopted the 24-hour clock in 1915, and the Allied armed forces followed soon after, with the British Army switching officially in 1918. The Canadian armed forces first started to use the 24-hour clock in late 1917. In 1920, the United States Navy was the first United States organisation to adopt the system; the United States Army, however, did not officially adopt the 24-hour clock until 1 July 1942.
The use of the 24-hour clock in the United Kingdom has grown steadily since the beginning of the 20th century, although attempts to make the system official failed more than once. In 1934, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) switched to the 24-hour clock for broadcast announcements and programme listings. The experiment was halted after five months following a lack of enthusiasm from the public, and the BBC continued using the 12-hour clock. In the same year, Pan American World Airways Corporation and Western Airlines in the United States both adopted the 24-hour clock. In modern times, the BBC uses a mixture of both the 12-hour and the 24-hour clock. British Rail, London Transport, and the London Underground switched to the 24-hour clock for timetables in 1964. A mixture of the 12- and 24-hour clocks similarly prevails in other English-speaking Commonwealth countries: French speakers have adopted the 24-hour clock in Canada much more broadly than English speakers, and Australia as well as New Zealand also use both systems.

<doc id="241365" wikidata="Q133667" url="?curid=241365" title="Sohn Kee-chung">
<text>Sohn Kee-chung (; ; August 29, 1912 – November 15, 2002) was a Korean Olympic athlete and long-distance runner. He became the first Korean to win a medal at the Olympic Games, winning gold in the marathon at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He was born in the Korean Peninsula, but he was forced to compete as a member of the Japanese delegation because Korea was under Japanese rule at the time. Sohn set an Olympic record of 2 hours 29 minutes 19.2 seconds.

Sohn competed under the Japanese name , as Korea was under Japanese occupation during his career.

==Early life==
Sohn Kee-chung was born on August 29, 1912, in Sinuiju (then &quot;Shingishū&quot;), Heianhoku-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now in North Korea). He was born into the .

Sohn reportedly had a talent for running even at a young age. In sixth grade, he placed first in a regional 5 km race, beating out older competitors. He studied at Yangchung High School in Seoul, which was reputed for its track and field program. He then enrolled in and graduated from Meiji University in Tokyo.

==Athletics career==
In 1931, he ran as the representative of his province at the Chōsen Shrine Competition () in Seoul (Keijō), and placed first. In 1932, he came in second in the Kyŏngyŏng Race (), which was hosted by newspaper &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot;. In April 1932, he won the Tokyo-Yokohama &quot;ekiden&quot; (road race).

Sohn first competed in the 1,500 and 5,000 m, but turned to longer distances after winning the Chōsen Shrine Competition in October 1933. Between 1933 and 1936, he ran 12 marathons; he finished in the top three on all occasions and won nine. On November 3, 1935, in Tokyo, Japan, Sohn set a world record in the marathon with a time of 2:26:42, which broke the world record 2:26:44 set by Yasuo Ikenaka of Japan at the Berlin Olympic trials on April 3, 1935, in Tokyo, Japan. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the record remained unbroken until Sohn&#x27;s own trainee, Suh Yun-Bok, won the 1947 Boston Marathon. Unofficially, he ran a marathon with a time under 2:24 on April 27, 1935, in Seoul, South Korea.

==1936 Berlin Olympics==

Sohn, competing for the Empire of Japan, won the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in the marathon. He ran the course in 2:29:19.2, breaking the Olympic record. His teammate Nam Sung-yong took the bronze medal. As Korea was under Japanese rule at the time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially credited Japan with Sohn&#x27;s gold and Nam&#x27;s bronze in the 1936 Summer Olympics medal count.

On December 9, 2011, the IOC recognized Sohn&#x27;s Korean nationality in his official profile. It cited his efforts to sign his Korean name and his stress on Korea&#x27;s status as a separate nation during interviews. The move was part of the Korean Olympic Committee&#x27;s repeated requests to acknowledge Sohn&#x27;s background. However, the IOC ruled out changing the nationality and registered name per official records to prevent historical distortions.

===Political significance ===
Under orders from Tokyo, Sohn Kee-chung had to compete using the Latin alphabet name of . It is the romanization of the Japanese pronunciation of his Korean name in hanja.

Sohn refused to acknowledge the Japanese anthem while it was played at his award ceremony and later told reporters that he was ashamed to run for Japan. When the &quot;Dong-a Ilbo&quot; published a photograph of Sohn at the medal ceremony, it altered the image to remove the Japanese flag from his running tunic. The act enraged the Japanese Governor-General of Korea Minami Jiro in Seoul. The Kempetai military police imprisoned eight people connected with the newspaper and suspended its publication for nine months.

=== Hellenic prize ===
For winning the marathon, Sohn was to have received an ancient Corinthian helmet from the 8th century BC, which was discovered at Olympia, Greece, and later purchased by a newspaper in Athens to give as an Olympic award. However, the IOC believed that presenting such a valuable gift to a runner would violate its amateur rules. The helmet was placed in a Berlin museum and remained there for 50 years. It was finally presented to Sohn in 1986. Sohn donated the helmet to the National Museum of Korea, which designated it as the 904th and only Western National Treasure. There was initially a plan to award replicas of this helmet to the winners of the 2006 Sohn Kee-chung marathon, but they eventually got only a chance to wear a replica.

==Later life==

Sohn was the team manager for the Korea at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics and was the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the London 1948 opening ceremony. Sohn spent the remainder of his career in South Korea coaching other notable runners such as Suh Yun-Bok, the winner of the Boston Marathon in 1947; Ham Kee-Yong, winner of the Boston Marathon in 1950; and Hwang Young-Cho, who was the gold medalist of the 1992 Summer Olympics marathon, and whom Sohn Kee-chung especially went to Barcelona to see. Sohn also became the Vice Chairman of the Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, he was given the honor of carrying the Olympic torch in the stadium during the opening ceremony.

Sohn authored an autobiography entitled &quot;My Motherland, My Marathon&quot; ().

He was honored with the Moran Class of the Korean Order of Civil Merit.

==Death and legacy==
Sohn died at midnight on November 15, 2002, at age 90 from pneumonia. He was buried at the Daejeon National Cemetery. The Sohn Kee-chung Park in Seoul was established in his honor. He was also posthumously made a Grand Cordon (Blue Dragon) of the Order of Sport Merit.

==In popular culture==
Sohn appears in Zainichi author Yu Miri&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The End of August&quot; () about her grandfather, Yang Im-deuk, who was a rival of Sohn&#x27;s when they were young.

* Portrayed by Ha Jung-woo in the 2023 film &quot;Road to Boston&quot;.

<text>Eleanor Rosalynn Carter ( ; ; August 18, 1927 – November 19, 2023) was an American activist and humanitarian who served as the first lady of the United States from 1977 to 1981, as the wife of President Jimmy Carter. Throughout her decades of public service, she was a leading advocate for women&#x27;s rights and mental health.

Carter was born and raised in Plains, Georgia, graduated as valedictorian of Plains High School, and soon after attended Georgia Southwestern College, where she graduated in 1946. She first became attracted to her future husband, also from Plains, after seeing a picture of him in his U.S. Naval Academy uniform, and they married in 1946. Carter helped her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, and decided to focus her attention in the field of mental health when she was that state&#x27;s first lady. She campaigned for him during his successful bid to become president of the United States in the 1976 election, defeating incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford.

Carter was politically active during her husband&#x27;s presidency, though she declared that she had no intention of being a traditional first lady. During his term of office, Carter supported her husband&#x27;s public policies, as well as his social and personal life. To remain fully informed, she sat in on Cabinet meetings at the invitation of the President. Carter also represented her husband in meetings with domestic and foreign leaders, including as an envoy to Latin America in 1977. He found her to be an equal partner. She campaigned for his failed re-election bid in the 1980 election, which he lost in a landslide to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan.

After leaving the White House in 1981, Carter continued to advocate for mental health and other causes, wrote several books, and became involved in the national and international work of the Carter Center. Her husband and she also contributed to the expansion of the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. In 1987, she founded the Institute for Caregivers, to inform and support the efforts of caregivers. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom alongside her husband in 1999.

==Early life==
Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on August 18, 1927, in Plains, Georgia. She was the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar Smith, an auto mechanic, bus driver, and farmer, and Frances Allethea &quot;Allie&quot; Murray Smith, a teacher, dressmaker, and postal worker. Her brothers were William Jerrold &quot;Jerry&quot; Smith (1929–2003), an engineer, and Murray Lee Smith (1932–2003), a teacher and minister. Her sister, Lillian Allethea (Smith) Wall (born 1936), known as Allethea, named for her mother and for Lillian Gordy Carter (the Smith and Carter families being friends), is a real estate broker. Rosalynn was named after Rosa Wise Murray, her maternal grandmother. Smith&#x27;s grand-uncle W.S. Wise was one of the American Brazilians known as Confederados who emigrated from the United States to the Brazilian Empire after the American Civil War.

Smith&#x27;s family lived in poverty, although she later said that her siblings and she were unaware of it, because even though their family &quot;didn&#x27;t have much money [...] neither did anyone else, so as far as we knew, we were well off.&quot; Churches and schools were at the center of her family&#x27;s community, and the people of Plains were familiar with each other. Smith played with the boys during her early childhood, since no girls on her street were her age. She drew buildings and was interested in airplanes, which led her to believe that she would someday become an architect.

Rosalynn&#x27;s father died of leukemia in 1940, when she was 13. She called the loss of her father the conclusion of her childhood. Thereafter, she helped her mother raise her younger siblings, and assisted in the dressmaking business to meet the family&#x27;s financial obligations. Rosalynn would credit her mother with inspiring her own independence and said that she learned from her mother that &quot;you can do what you have to do&quot;. At Plains High School, Rosalynn worked hard to achieve her father&#x27;s dream of seeing her go to college. Rosalynn graduated as valedictorian of Plains High School. Soon after, she attended Georgia Southwestern College and graduated in 1946. During her time in college, Rosalynn served as vice president of her class and was a founding member of her school&#x27;s Young Democrats, Campus Marshal, and Tumbling Clubs. She graduated with a junior college diploma.

Rosalynn first dated Jimmy Carter in 1945 while he was attending the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Rosalynn agreed to marry Jimmy in February 1946, when she went to Annapolis with his parents. The two scheduled their marriage to take place in July and kept the arrangement secret. Rosalynn was hesitant to tell her mother she had chosen to marry instead of continuing her education. On July 7, 1946, they married in Plains. Their marriage caused Rosalynn to cancel her plans to attend Georgia State College for Women, where she had planned to study interior design. The couple had four children: John William &quot;Jack&quot; (b. 1947), James Earl &quot;Chip&quot; III (b. 1950), Donnel Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; (b. 1952), and Amy Lynn (b. 1967).

==Politics==

=== First Lady of Georgia (1971–1975) ===

After helping her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, Rosalynn decided to focus her attention mainly in the field of mental health when she was that state&#x27;s first lady. She was appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. Many of the commission&#x27;s recommendations were approved and became law. In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental-health facilities across Georgia. She described her efforts on behalf of mentally disabled children as her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia.

Carter also served as a volunteer at the Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta, and for four years was honorary chairperson for the Georgia Special Olympics.

Her work in addressing social issues made her &quot;virtually revered in professional health-care circles.&quot; Her activities included entertaining as many as 750 people a week for dinner at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Governor Carter once claimed that he had supported the Equal Rights Amendment, while his wife was opposed to the measure; the First Lady privately confronted him upon hearing news of the claim, and Carter corrected himself by later announcing to the press, &quot;I thought I knew what Rosalynn thought, but I was wrong.&quot;

===1976 presidential campaign===
When her husband&#x27;s gubernatorial term ended in January 1975, Rosalynn, Jimmy, and Amy Carter returned to Plains. Jimmy had already announced his plans to run for president of the United States. Rosalynn got back on the campaign trail, this time on a national quest to gather support for her husband. She campaigned alone on his behalf in 41 states. Because of her husband&#x27;s obscurity at the time, she often had to answer the question, &quot;Jimmy who?&quot; She promoted the establishment of additional daycare facilities and adjustments to &quot;Social Security and so many other things to help the elderly.&quot;

During the months when she was campaigning across the country, she was elected to the board of directors of the National Association of Mental Health, honored by the National Organization for Women with an Award of Merit for her vigorous support for the Equal Rights Amendment, and received the Volunteer of the Year Award from the Southwestern Association of Volunteer Services.

Rosalynn sat in the balcony at Madison Square Garden with friends and family the night of the nomination, while her husband was with his mother and daughter. She had &quot;butterflies in her stomach&quot; until the Ohio delegation announced its votes were for her husband. Rosalynn wished she could have been with him at that time. The Carters met with all the potential running mates, and instantly gained affinity for Walter Mondale after meeting with him and his wife Joan. Following the election, the Carters traveled to the White House and met with President Ford and First Lady Betty Ford, the latter becoming a role model for Rosalynn.

===First Lady of the United States (1977–1981)===

====Major initiatives====

When her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down Pennsylvania Avenue during his presidential inauguration parade. The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the Atlanta balls when Jimmy became governor.
Carter declared that she had no intention of being a traditional first lady of the United States. During her husband&#x27;s administration, she supported his public policies, as well as his social and personal life. To remain fully informed, she sat in on Cabinet meetings at the invitation of the President. The first meeting she attended was on February 28, 1977, where she felt comfortable since she was among other officials who were not members. The idea for her to be in attendance came at her husband&#x27;s suggestion when she started to question him about a news story.

Carter took notes at the meetings, but never spoke. As she put it, &quot;I was there to be informed so that when I traveled across the country, which I did a great deal, and was questioned by the press and other individuals about all areas of government, I&#x27;d know what was going on.&quot; When the cultural exchange program Friendship Force International launched at the White House on March 1, 1977, she became honorary chairperson, a position she held until 2002. She joined Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford in supporting the unsuccessful campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) at the Houston conference celebrating the International Women&#x27;s Year in 1977.

For Christmas 1977, she decorated the White House&#x27;s Christmas tree with ornaments made from pine cones, peanuts, and egg shells. On July 27, 1978, Carter was the host of &quot;First Lady&#x27;s Employment Seminar&quot;. Between 200 and 300 delegates came and shared information to learn how other communities responded to the problem of unemployment. Carter remembered 1979 and 1980 as years of never-ending crises, the years having &quot;Big ones and small ones, potential disasters and mere annoyances.&quot;

During 1978, Carter became involved with an effort to reform D.C. General Hospital after criticizing its appearance, and traveled to the hospital for reviews of changing conditions as more work was done in remodeling.
Despite finding time to entertain, the Carters never were able to match their immediate predecessors and Carter never considered it a major part of her job as first lady.
Criticism came towards her role as first lady by a U.S. diplomat in Brazil, who insisted that women were meant to be kept &quot;at home and that&#x27;s all&quot;. The cultural factor had also caused many to oppose her trip. Critics called her too programmed and disciplined, while others said she lacked admirable qualities of Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford. Despite this, Carter was pleased by her viewed role as a demanding first lady and remembered the times of presidents&#x27; wives being &quot;confined&quot; to &quot;official hostess&quot; and other demeaning roles. In efforts to advance the appearance of the White House, she accumulated American paintings.

After the Carter administration began losing popularity, Carter advised that Gerald Rafshoon be brought on as White House Director of Communications and that key media figures be invited to the White House for &quot;informal, off‐the‐record, deep discussions about issues.&quot; Rafshoon was selected and confirmed for the position.

====Mental health campaign====
In March 1977, Carter gave her first interview since becoming first lady. She outlined her goals in focusing on mental health: &quot;For every person who needs mental-health care to be able to receive it close to his home, and to remove the stigma from mental-health care so people will be free to talk about it and seek help. It&#x27;s been taboo for so long to admit you had a mental-health problem.&quot;

Carter served as an active honorary chair of the President&#x27;s Commission on Mental Health. On behalf of the Mental Health System Bill enacted in 1980, she testified before a Senate committee, making her the second first lady to appear before the Congress (the first being Eleanor Roosevelt). Of her priorities, mental health was the highest. Working to change the nature of government assistance to the mentally ill, Carter wanted to allow people to be comfortable admitting their disabilities without fear of being called crazy.

====Influence====
After Carter had been first lady for two years, &quot;Time&quot; called her the &quot;second-most powerful person in the United States.&quot; Many times, Carter&#x27;s husband called her an equal partner. He also said she was a &quot;perfect extension of myself.&quot; During a 1977 interview, Carter admitted that she quarreled with him over his policies, but his own decision was what he acted on, and she denied influencing his major decisions. In an interview the following year, Carter stated that she did not publicly disagree with her husband&#x27;s policies out of a belief that she &quot;would lose all my effectiveness with him&quot;, as well as her opinion that the gesture would not assist in changing his perspective to her own. She said that a first lady could influence officials or the public by discussing an issue or giving attention to it.

Biographer MaryAnne Borrelli wrote that Carter considered her attempts to portray herself as a traditional wife and influencing factor in her husband&#x27;s administration would be &quot;viewed by some as dependent upon her husband, by others as lacking accountability, and by still others as doing too little—or too much&quot;. Years after leaving the White House, Carter would remain bothered by claims that she exerted too much influence on her husband, insisting they had an equal partnership. Jimmy Carter would later write that the two engaged in discussions on a variety of issues, and she was aware of everything within the administration apart from &quot;a few highly secret and sensitive security matters&quot;.

====Travels====

Carter represented her husband in meetings with domestic and foreign leaders, most notably as an envoy to Latin America in 1977. She purposely scheduled her meetings so as not to have any with the heads of state. President Carter said that while his wife had initially been met with hesitance as an American representative, &quot;at the conclusion of those meetings, they now rely on her substantially to be sure that I understand the sensitivities of the people&quot;. Following the Latin America meetings, David Vidal observed, &quot;Mrs. Carter has achieved a personal and diplomatic success that goes far beyond the modest expectations of both her foreign policy tutors at the State Department and her hosts.&quot;

In a June 7, 1977, news conference, Carter stated that her meetings with Brazilian leaders included discussions on human rights and her wishes for Brazil to include itself among other countries seeking a reduction in nuclear weapons via an international study. On December 30, 1977, Rosalynn Carter and National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met with Stefan Wyszyński at the Cardinal&#x27;s Warsaw residence. President Carter said the meeting was intended to display American &quot;appreciation for the degree of freedom of worship in the country&quot;.

Carter led the American delegation to the May 1978 inauguration of Rodrigo Carazo Odio as president of Costa Rica. In August 1978, she led the American delegation to the funeral of Pope Paul VI in Rome.

She also led a delegation to Thailand in 1979 to address the problems of Cambodian and Laotian refugees. She examined camps where Cambodian refugees had fled to avoid the combat between the Vietnamese troops and the government of Pol Pot. Helping the refugees, particularly the children, became a special cause for her. She returned to the United States and played a prominent role in expediting an appeal for large assistance after she witnessed their suffering during her visit. By this time, however, her husband had met with families of the hostages in Iran. The families were more concerned about what they needed to do to get their loved ones out than they were about whether or not they would ever get out. Carter stated that she had wanted to return to the U.S. as quickly as possible to mobilize assistance to assuage the refugees&#x27; plight.

====Life in the White House====
Carter was the first of all the first ladies to keep her own office in the East Wing. She also oversaw her family at the White House. Her daughter, Amy, attracted much public attention. The two youngest sons, Chip and Jeff, and their families also lived in the White House. Other members of the family, including son Jack and his wife and children, were frequent visitors. Carter&#x27;s Secret Service codename was &quot;Dancer&quot;. In 1977, Carter reported that her family was divided in their reaction to public perception of them, saying her sons were worried about how they would be perceived living there, while she personally thought nothing of it as the public was not financing their residence and she favored the family being together.

On August 16, 1979, Carter released a statement announcing Edith J. Dobelle had accepted &quot;the newly created position of staff director for the East Wing&quot;.

After leaving the White House, Carter reflected of Washington, &quot;I love this city. I loved living here and being so close to the seat of power, being a part of the political system. When you watched television you knew the people involved, you were familiar with both sides of the issues.&quot;

====Equal Rights Amendment====
During the 1976 campaign, Carter spoke to feminists about her equal partnership with her husband. In January 1977, prior to his inauguration, Carter substituted for him in speaking with Senator Birch Bayh over the phone, as the latter wanted President-elect Carter to lobby for support of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) being ratified in Indiana. She persuaded Wayne Townsend to switch his vote and the ERA was approved in an Indiana Senate vote of 26 to 24.

In reference to Carter&#x27;s role in supporting the ERA, Texas Christian University Associate Professor of Religion Elizabeth Flowers said, &quot;[Rosalynn Carter] wanted to temper down some of the more radical elements of feminism, as she saw it, and challenge what she felt were caricatures of the movement. She wanted to be sure that the struggle for ERA really appealed to mainstream America.&quot;

====Public image====
During the 1976 election cycle, journalists dubbed Carter the &quot;steel magnolia&quot; for having a fragile and feminine appearance that concealed a &quot;tough as nails&quot; interior. Carter was known for a lack of attention paid to fashion, and her choice to wear the gown she wore at her husband&#x27;s swearing-in as governor to his presidential inauguration reinforced this view of her. Carter&#x27;s public interest in national policy prompted Kandy Stroud of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to speculate she might become the most activist first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Amid the sinking approval ratings of her husband, Carter maintained high favorable viewpoints in the eyes of the public, and was tied with Mother Teresa for most-admired woman in the world. In April 1979, during her speech as guest speaker at the 1979 Matrix Awards Luncheon of New York Women in Communications Inc., Carter said the issues she was championing were being met with opposition due to their lack of sexiness in being topics a first lady discusses.

===1980 presidential campaign===
President Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy for his re-election bid in the Democratic presidential primaries. He would later write that the ongoing Iran hostage crisis impacted his choice to rely on his wife among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail. Vice President Mondale would come to view himself and Rosalynn as President Carter&#x27;s proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle. She would reflect that the Iowa victory of the Carter re-election campaign, which saw President Carter defeat Kennedy 59.2% to 31.2%, made it easier for her to be unbothered by Kennedy&#x27;s attacks. Although President Carter was able to secure the nomination, Rosalynn would come to believe that Kennedy had damaged the Democratic Party through his campaign and inadequately assisted in the general election: &quot;He was a poor loser. I thought that once he saw that he could not win, he would try to help the Democratic Party, because I thought it was so important to keep Ronald Reagan out of the White House and I thought he should have helped. Instead, he tore the Democratic Party to pieces.&quot;

In the last few months of her husband&#x27;s presidency, Rosalynn was confident that her husband and she would be able to defeat Reagan in the general election. On her birthday, she saw polls that showed they were gaining on Reagan, whose previous lead of 25% had decreased to 7%. In the November 4 election, Carter lost to Reagan in a landslide. She later cited Christian conservatives, the Iran hostage crisis, inflation, and the desire to wage a protest vote against the current administration with having contributed to Carter&#x27;s defeat. Her husband&#x27;s loss came shortly after the passing of the Mental Health System Act, which sought to do much of what she had worked for during her tenure as first lady. However, after Ronald Reagan was elected, she reflected, &quot;funding of our legislation was killed, by the philosophy of a new President. It was a bitter loss.&quot;

In the days following the election, Carter experienced depression, which led her husband to express the benefits of his impending post-presidency. She telephoned supporters of the re-election campaign to thank them for their involvement, and met with Reagan&#x27;s wife, Nancy, during the transitional period and gave her a tour of the White House. Carter and Nancy Reagan developed a friendship as a result of their shared support for the ERA. She was also satisfied that the Iran hostages were released on the day of Reagan&#x27;s inauguration.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===

Their families were already acquainted when Rosalynn first dated Jimmy Carter in 1945 while he was attending the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. She became attracted to him after seeing a picture of him in his Annapolis uniform. The two were riding in the back seat of the car of Ruth Carter Stapleton&#x27;s boyfriend when Jimmy surprised Rosalynn by kissing her. This was the first time that Rosalynn had ever allowed a boy to do so on the first date. Rosalynn agreed to marry Jimmy in February 1946 when she went to Annapolis with his parents. The two scheduled their marriage to take place in July, and kept the arrangement secret. Rosalynn resisted telling her mother she had chosen to marry instead of continuing her education. On July 7, 1946, they married in Plains. Their marriage caused Rosalynn to cancel her plans to attend Georgia State College for Women, where she had planned to study interior design.

The couple had four children: John William &quot;Jack&quot; (b. 1947), James Earl &quot;Chip&quot; III (b. 1950), Donnel Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; (b. 1952), and Amy Lynn (b. 1967). Due to Jimmy&#x27;s military duties, the first three were born in different parts of the country and away from Georgia. During that time, Rosalynn enjoyed the independence she had gained from raising the children on her own. However, their relationship faced its first major crisis when she opposed Jimmy&#x27;s resigning to return to Plains in 1953 after he learned his father was dying. Jimmy reflected that she &quot;avoided talking to me as much as possible&quot; as a result of his decision and would interact with him through their children. The Carters were fans of the New York Yankees until the Braves moved to Atlanta. They said they never went to bed arguing with each other.

In 1953, after her husband left the Navy, Rosalynn helped run the family peanut farm and warehouse business, handling accounting responsibilities. Around this time, yearning for another child, the Carters discovered Rosalynn had physical ailments preventing pregnancy. She underwent surgery to remove a large tumor from her uterus 12 years later. Her obstetrician confirmed she could have another child, and their daughter Amy was born thereafter.
Rosalynn had different relationships with each member of Jimmy&#x27;s family. Becoming friends with his sister, who was two years younger than she, Rosalynn gave her dresses she had outgrown. However, she and Jimmy&#x27;s mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, had difficulty living together.

In later years, the couple rode two and a half miles a day on three-wheel electric scooters, and they read the Bible aloud to each other in Spanish before they went to bed each night.

From 1962 (the year Jimmy was elected to the Georgia State Senate) until her death, she had been active in the political arena. Carter backed Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 presidential election, which she stated put her and her family at odds with other Georgians and caused them to develop a closeness with each other over shared values that others opposed.

Jimmy thoroughly consulted with Rosalynn before he mounted a bid for governor of Georgia in 1966. She traveled to many towns throughout the state with promotional materials, visiting establishments such as radio stations and newspaper offices, and attending meetings of civic organizations. In one encounter, she tried endorsing her husband to a man in Washington, Georgia, the latter declaring his support for Republican candidate Bo Callaway before spitting on her. Rosalynn would later describe the encounter as the &quot;worst political experience of my life.&quot; Summarizing the race, Carter wrote, &quot;This was a brief and rushed campaign, but we all learned many things that were helpful to us later.&quot; The 1966 gubernatorial campaign saw the beginning of new interactions between the Carters, as Rosalynn was now determined to know her husband&#x27;s positions on issues and be informed.

The month after the election, Jimmy Carter began campaigning for the 1970 Georgia gubernatorial election. In this campaign, Rosalynn made speeches, which she had not done in prior campaigns. The Carters were separated for most of their travels, and she also began writing speeches for the first time in her involvement in politics. When she met a Carter campaign worker who confided in Rosalynn that her daughter had a mental illness, the sight of the exhausted woman haunted Carter and became a factor in her eventual focus on mental health. Jimmy would later disclose that during the campaign and in the years of his governorship they became &quot;keenly aware of the unmet needs of people in our state who suffered from mental and emotional disabilities.&quot;

Mary Prince (an African-American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was Amy&#x27;s nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency ended, partly thanks to Rosalynn&#x27;s belief in Prince&#x27;s innocence.

===Other activities===
Rosalynn and her husband former President Jimmy Carter traveled to Mongolia in 2013 and both Carters fished for taimen.

Rosalynn created the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers in 1987.

===Health and death===
In April 1977, Carter underwent surgery to remove a nonmalignant breast tumor. She underwent a gynecological procedure at Bethesda Naval Hospital in August 1977, which her press secretary Mary Hoyt described as a routine private matter.

On May 30, 2023, the Carter Center announced that Carter had been diagnosed with dementia. The statement also noted that she continued to live at home with her husband – who was in hospice care at the time of the announcement – &quot;enjoying spring and visits with loved ones&quot;. On November 17, 2023, Carter entered hospice care. Her health had been failing amid a urinary tract infection which had not improved with antibiotics. She died two days later at her home in Plains, Georgia, at age 96.
Jimmy Carter said of his wife following her death, &quot;Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished.&quot; He died thirteen months later on December 29, 2024.

===Funeral===
On November 27, a motorcade which began in Plains arrived in Americus, where Carter&#x27;s casket was carried from the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center to a waiting hearse by former members of Carter&#x27;s United States Secret Service detail. The motorcade stopped at Carter&#x27;s alma mater Georgia Southwestern State University (GSW), where GSW president Neal Weaver and Jennifer Olsen, CEO of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, placed two wreaths near her statue at the university&#x27;s Rosalynn Carter Health and Human Sciences Complex. The motorcade then traveled via Interstates 75 and 285 to The Carter Center in Atlanta, where she lay in repose at the center&#x27;s Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum. During this time, a service was held and the public paid their respects.

A tribute service was held at the Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church at Emory University in northeast Atlanta on November 28. The service was televised on all television stations in the Atlanta market, and was also carried on some networks nationally. Jimmy Carter, who was in hospice care, attended, donning a blanket featuring images of Rosalynn and himself and with references to their hometown of Plains. President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and former president Bill Clinton also attended. All living former first ladies, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama, and Melania Trump attended the tribute service. Georgia governor and first lady Brian and Marty Kemp were also in attendance, as well as Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens. In addition to several others, friend and PBS journalist Judy Woodruff offered a spoken tribute. Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood performed John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; at the ceremony.

A private funeral was held on November 29 at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, with the Carter family and invited close friends in attendance. Jimmy Carter attended the Plains funeral, where he and their children wore leis to reference the family&#x27;s time in Hawaii. After a final procession through Plains, Carter was buried during a private service at her residence.

==Activism==
===The Carter Center===
After the Carters left the White House in 1981, they continued to lead a very active life. In 1982, she co-founded the Carter Center, a private, nonprofit institution based in Atlanta, Georgia. The Carters returned to the home they had built in 1961 in Plains, Georgia. She was a member of the center&#x27;s board of trustees and participated in many of the center&#x27;s programs, but gave special attention to the mental health program. Carter and her husband fell into serious debt immediately after leaving the White House, but were able to pay off their debts by engaging in writing projects and eventually were able to open the Carter Center from their revenue. She, like Betty Ford before her, would say the American people made a mistake in not re-electing her husband and was bitter over the election. At this time she expressed resentment of Ronald Reagan, and even told interviewer Mike Wallace that he was ruining the country. Rumors at this time spread that she was running for Governor of Georgia, which she denied and outright stated that she had no political ambition. Nearly two decades later when Hillary Clinton was pondering whether or not to run for Senator in New York, Carter was asked why she had not run for the Georgia Senate. She responded &quot;What would I have done in Washington, with Jimmy in Georgia?&quot;

Carter and her husband&#x27;s first major project with the Carter Center was to help broker a peace deal between Israel and its neighbors. They visited the Middle East in March 1983 and worked with Kenneth W. Stein and other associates of the Carter administration. They invited top leaders from a wide range of cities and countries to participate, including the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.

In the early summer of 1986, the Carters aided the poor by helping to build homes on the north and west sides of Chicago. They were accompanied by members of Habitat for Humanity as they wielded hammers and saws while working for a week to construct homes in a vacant lot. In 1991, the Carters removed themselves and the Carter Center from direct involvement in the Middle East at the time that President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s administration, especially Secretary of State James Baker, became more active in that region. However, they did monitor the Oslo peace agreement of 1993, which sprang from the President and Secretary of State&#x27;s bringing Palestinians and other parties involved in the matter to a conference in Madrid.

====Mental health advocacy====

Carter created and served as the chair of The Carter Center Mental Health Task Force, an advisory board of experts, consumers, and advocates promoting positive change in the mental health field. She hosted the annual Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy, bringing together nationwide leaders in the mental health field.

In April 1984, she became an Honorary Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and served as a board member emeritus of the National Mental Health Association. In 1985, she started the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy. The launch and its proceeds allowed representatives of mental health organizations to come together and collaborate on prominent issues. The success of the symposium led to the creation of the Mental Health Program in 1991. Carter established the Mental Health Task Force that same year to guide the Symposia as well as other Mental Health programs. She became chair of the International Women Leaders for Mental Health in 1992, and three years later she was honored with the naming of the Rosalynn Carter Mental Georgia Health Forum after her.

The Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism provide stipends to journalists to report on topics related to mental health or mental illnesses. The one-year fellowship seeks to promote public awareness of mental health issues, as well as to erase the stigma associated with them. In September 2004, Carter met with the recipients of the eighth annual Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism at the Carter Center.

In 2007, Carter joined with David Wellstone, son of one-time U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, in pushing Congress to pass legislation regarding mental health insurance. She and Wellstone worked to pass the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 which requires equal coverage of mental and physical illnesses when policies include both types of coverage. Furthermore, both testified before a House subcommittee regarding the bill in July 2007.

Legislation requiring parity in health insurance coverage for treatment of mental illnesses was ultimately passed and signed into law in October 2008.

===Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers===
Carter was president of the board of directors for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving (RCI) at Georgia Southwestern State University, her alma mater in Americus, Georgia. The RCI, which was established in 1987, aims to address issues related to caregiving in both the United States and internationally. The institute focuses its work on both family and professional caregivers for individuals living with chronic illness and disabilities, limitations related to aging, and other health concerns people encounter in their lifespan. It plays a major role in moving science into practice for caregivers by supporting the implementation of evidence-based programs and interventions for caregivers in community settings. The inaugural Rosalynn Carter Institute Gala Celebration of Caregivers took place in June 2004 in Atlanta Symphony Hall and featured Carter presenting bronze medallions to award winners.

===Advocacy for women and children===
In 1977, Carter was a speaker at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference among other speakers including Betty Ford, Bella Abzug, Lady Bird Johnson, Barbara Jordan, Audrey Colom, Claire Randall, Gerridee Wheeler, Cecilia Burciaga, Gloria Steinem, Lenore Hershey and Jean O&#x27;Leary.

In 1988, she convened with three other former first ladies—Betty Ford, Lady Bird Johnson, and Pat Nixon—at the &quot;Women and the Constitution&quot; conference in The Carter Center to assess that document&#x27;s impact on women. The conference featured over 150 speakers and 1,500 attendees from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries. The conference was meant to promote awareness of sexual inequality in other countries, and to fight against it in the United States.

Carter served on the Policy Advisory Board of The Atlanta Project (TAP) of The Carter Center, addressing social ills associated with poverty and quality of life citywide.

In 1991, Carter launched Every Child By Two, a nationwide campaign that sought to increase early childhood immunizations along with Betty Bumpers, wife of former U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. Carter served as president of the organization and Bumpers as vice president. The campaign&#x27;s launch was in response to the deaths of nearly 150 people after a resurgence of measles.

Carter also served on the board of advisors for Habitat for Humanity and as an honorary chair of Project Interconnections, both of which aim to provide housing for those in need. Additionally, she was a deacon at her and her husband&#x27;s Plains Baptist church.

==Other activities==
Shortly after leaving office, Carter signed with Houghton Mifflin for the writing of her autobiography. Carter&#x27;s memoir, &quot;First Lady from Plains&quot;, was released in 1984. Mark Updegrove wrote that her memoir, and that of her husband, &quot;Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a President&quot;, succeeded in &quot;boosting the bank account and spirits of their authors.&quot; In a March 1981 interview, Carter&#x27;s work on the autobiography was noted by her husband, who said that she would be &quot;starting on a book shortly&quot; without disclosing what the contents would be.

After the Carters left the White House, Carter still had sour feelings about her husband&#x27;s loss of the election, and questioned how he could not be re-elected despite what she believed were the good choices he had made during his presidency.
In a 1984 interview, Carter was asked about her opinions on the 1984 presidential election, saying she was unsure if it was the right time for a female vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket and that the most important thing for the Democrats should be winning against Reagan, whose policies she charged were tragic. Carter also voiced her desire for her husband to run for a second non-consecutive term. She knew in her heart that her husband would not seek a non-consecutive term and went into depression in the early weeks of the retirement, Jimmy&#x27;s attempts at portraying an artificial happiness strained the relationship due to him seeming to not understand her reasons for being disappointed in their current state of affairs.

Throughout the 1980s, Carter gave many speeches to audiences on the subject of caring for caregivers. She later reflected that members of the audience &quot;came up to me crying, saying that this was the first time someone understood what they were going through.&quot;

After the October 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, the Carters contacted his wife Jehan Sadat and traveled with former presidents Nixon and Ford to represent the United States at his funeral. The Carters visited Jehan, who Rosalynn pledged to stay with during the funeral. Later that month, the Carters attended the National Mental Health Association&#x27;s gala dinner dance, their first visit to Washington since leaving the White House. Carter presented former Governor of New York W. Averell Harriman with an award during the event. In December, she released a statement on the death of her personal secretary Rita Regina Merthan.

In October 1982, Carter attended the funeral of Bess Truman in Independence, Missouri.

In March 1983, the Carters traveled throughout the Middle East. In late 1983, Carter visited her ailing mother-in-law Lillian Carter at Americus-Sumter County Hospital, and was by her bedside when she died. Days later, she attended the funeral, where a eulogist hailed Lillian&#x27;s many good works.

In October 1985, the Carters traveled to Nepal for a thirteen-day vacation in the Himalayan kingdom.

In July 1986, Carter traveled with her husband to Chicago, Illinois for a weekend assisting with construction projects for Habitat for Humanity. In October, the Carters gave President Reagan and his wife Nancy a tour of the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum.

On January 19, 1988, Carter was given the honor of christening the cruise ship &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; in a gala ceremony in Miami. It was the largest cruise ship in the world at the time. A special oversized liter bottle of Taittinger&#x27;s champagne was used.

In March 1988, Carter attended a hearing on mental health by the House Select Committee on Aging. She lamented that ten years after a presidential commission found that 10 percent of Americans needed some form of mental health care, &quot;most who were underserved at that time are still underserved in 1988&quot;. Later that month, the Carters traveled to Nigeria for discussions with officials on disease control and rural development projects.

Carter attended the November 4, 1991, dedication of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum.

On September 13, 1993, the Carters returned to the White House for a ceremony that featured the signing by Israel and the PLO of an agreement on Palestinian self-government. Former president George H. W. Bush joined the Carters in staying overnight at the invitation of President Bill Clinton so that they could attend a ceremony promoting the North American Free Trade Agreement the next day. This marked &quot;the first time ever that two former presidents have stayed as guests of the President overnight&quot;, according to a presidential aide.

In August 1994, the Carters organized a Habitat for Humanity crew for the rebuilding of the house of family friend Annie Mae after it had been destroyed in a flood the previous month.

===2000s===
On December 4, 2001, Carter delivered a speech to the National Press Club.

In January 2003, Carter attended the benefit for the 20th anniversary celebration of the Betty Ford Center in Indian Wells, California.

During the June 5, 2004, christening of the USS &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; in Groton, Connecticut, Carter served as the ship sponsor and christened the ship with a bottle of champagne. On October 11, 2004, Carter delivered the keynote address at the AAP National Conference &amp; Exhibition, stating that she would favor medical school curricula requiring doctors to have the ability to recognize mental health symptoms and stressing the importance of recognizing symptoms in early childhood.

In December 2006, Carter was ordained a deacon at the Maranatha Baptist Church.

In January 2007, Carter and her husband joined other first ladies and presidents in attending the funeral of Gerald Ford, and six months later attended Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s as well. In a 2007 interview shortly before her 80th birthday, Carter said she would continue keeping a full schedule despite wanting to curtail it due to her advancing age, and that she had planned to lower her workload, but failed to do so because she still did not &quot;want to miss anything.&quot;

In March 2009, the Carters met with National Security Advisor James L. Jones for a &quot;general briefing&quot;. Carter was present for the April 21, 2009, signing by President Barack Obama of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.

===2010s===
In 2010, Carter criticized television crime dramas that portrayed mentally ill people as violent, when in fact they were more prone to being victims of crime. On May 7, 2010, she attended the Michelle Obama-hosted Mother&#x27;s Day Tea at the White House, and was joined by her granddaughter Sarah and infant great-granddaughter. On October 26, Carter appeared on a discussion panel at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum.

After the death of Betty Ford on July 8, 2011, Carter delivered a eulogy during a memorial service. Carter called her one who had the courage to speak the truth and fight stigmas surrounding illness and addiction, even calling her &quot;a tireless advocate for those struggling.&quot;

Carter attended a speech given by Georgia National Guard&#x27;s Colonel Brent Bracewell in the morning hours of October 25, 2012. Carter gave out the Georgia Paraprofessional Caregiver of the Year, Volunteer Caregiver of the Year, Family Caregiver of the Year, and an award with her namesake, the Rosalynn Carter Leadership in Caregiving Award later that day and expressed happiness in the amount of progress that had been made &quot;since we started.&quot;
On April 25, 2013, Carter attended the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum with her husband and other former first ladies and presidents. In October 2013, Carter spoke about her confidence in the American people and her lack of confidence in the government on the issue of the income gap in the United States. Carter saw &quot;one of the greatest disappointments&quot; corrected in November 2013 when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced that the Obama administration had passed a mental health insurance rule. She said she was &quot;shaking&quot; upon learning that the new government rules required equal treatment for mental health care. She and her husband were saddened by the death of Nelson Mandela.

In 2013, Rosalynn traveled to the neighborhood of Queens Village in New York City to help with 5 housing construction projects. Jimmy Carter, Chip Carter, and Chip&#x27;s wife Becky also traveled to New York with her to volunteer.

In August 2015, Jimmy announced his cancer diagnosis, stating that it had spread throughout his body. At the time of the announcement, Betty Pope, cousin of the former president, attested to Rosalynn&#x27;s strength and voiced her belief that the former first lady would remain committed to her husband. Carter made her first public comments about the illness a month later in September, saying, &quot;In spite of what&#x27;s going on, it&#x27;s been kind of wonderful just to know we have that kind of support, and also Jimmy&#x27;s attitude is helping.&quot; In November 2015, she and her husband traveled to Memphis, Tennessee where they assisted in construction for the town&#x27;s Habitat for Humanity affiliate.

In January 2016, Jimmy Carter confirmed that he was having regular treatments and said of Rosalynn at the time, &quot;Her support has helped me through the last 69 years since we&#x27;ve been married in everything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Of course, when I was ill and thought I might die at any time, she was there for me.&quot; Carter attended the March 11, 2016, funeral of Nancy Reagan at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. In July 2016, Carter endorsed Proposition 62, which would abolish the death penalty in California, releasing a joint statement with her husband in support of the measure. She voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary of that year. Carter differed from her husband in believing Russia had interfered with determining the results of the general election. Upon the death of Barbara Bush on April 17, 2018, Carter became the oldest living former first lady. On October 17, 2019, she became the longest-married former first lady.

===2020s===
In July 2021, the Carters celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary, becoming the first presidential couple to do so.

<doc id="241375" wikidata="Q1435042" url="?curid=241375" title="LaSalle, Ontario">
<text>LaSalle is a town in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. It is a bedroom community of the City of Windsor and part of the Windsor Census Metropolitan Area, and is located south of that city. LaSalle, along with Windsor, is the oldest French settlement area in Southwestern Ontario, and the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in Canada west of the Quebec border. The town was named for explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.

The current Town of Lasalle was originally incorporated as the Township of Sandwich West in 1861. A portion of the township incorporated as the Town of Lasalle in 1924, but was dissolved in 1959 and rejoined Sandwich West. In 1991, the Township changed its status to that of a Town and was renamed Lasalle. It is the second most populous municipality within Essex County after the Municipality of Lakeshore. The town&#x27;s land area includes Fighting Island in the Detroit River at its western side. Fighting Island is privately owned by BASF, the world&#x27;s largest chemical company.

== Town features ==
One of LaSalle&#x27;s biggest events is the annual Strawberry Festival which takes place on the first weekend in June. The annual LaSalle Craft Beer Festival, put on by the Corporation of the Town of LaSalle, is another annual event that features different types of beer, from popular brands to smaller microbreweries.

In LaSalle, there are two secondary schools: Sandwich Secondary School and St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic Secondary School. Elementary schools include Sacred Heart Elementary School, Legacy Oak Trail Public School, LaSalle Public School, Sandwich West Public School, École Monseigneur Augustin Caron, and Holy Cross Catholic Elementary School.

LaSalle also has a bicycle trail network called the LaSalle Trail, which links up to neighbouring Windsor Trail network, allowing people to ride from Sandwich Secondary School to Windsor&#x27;s Riverfront Trail. The town has expressed intention to connect LaSalle (and indirectly, Windsor) to the Chrysler Canada Greenway by constructing a link to the Trans Canada Trail near Oldcastle.

LaSalle&#x27;s Brunet Park has a 2.6 km loop trail, and is generally considered an easy route which takes an average of 28 minutes to complete. With 40 km of paved trails in LaSalle, you can walk, jog or ride your bicycle throughout the town. There are 16 signs along the trails, with facts about LaSalle, Ontario and/or Canada.

The town also features the Vollmer Culture and Recreation Complex, home to the LaSalle Vipers, of the GOJHL and the LaSalle Sabres, of the OMHA. It is also home to the LaSalle Stompers, of the Ontario Soccer Association. The complex has multiple rooms for hosting of events, 2 arenas, an Olympic-sized pool and slide, outdoor skate park, splash pad, soccer fields, and baseball diamonds.

==LaSalle Landing==

LaSalle is currently revitalizing their waterfront with an initiative called the LaSalle Landing. This project will include an event centre, a retention pond, sport zone, water fountain, skate trail, boat launch and multiple new bridges. This project is projected to cost 48.5 million dollars. LaSalle will be using $4 500 000 from the Federal Gas Tax and $500 000 from the Pedestrian Safety Reserve to help pay for the project. LaSalle has taken on $12 000 000 of debt after being denied a grant through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

==Communities==
Besides the urban area proper of LaSalle itself, the town of LaSalle comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Delisle&#x27;s Corners, Heritage Estates, Lukerville, Oliver and River Canard.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, LaSalle had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="241376" wikidata="Q4693960" url="?curid=241376" title="Agricultural fencing">
<text>In agriculture, fences are used to keep animals in or out of an area. They can be made from a wide variety of materials, depending on terrain, location and animals to be confined. Most agricultural fencing averages about high, and in some places, the height and construction of fences designed to hold livestock is mandated by law.

A  is the strip of land by a fence that is left uncultivated. It may be a hedgerow or a shelterbelt (windbreak) or a refugee for native plants. If not too narrow, it acts as a habitat corridor.

==History==

Historically throughout most of the world, domesticated livestock would roam freely and were fenced out of areas, such as gardens or fields of crops, where they were unwanted. Over time, especially where crop agriculture became dominant and population density of both humans and animals was significant, livestock owners were made to fence their animals in.

The earliest fences were made of available materials, usually stone or wood, and these materials are still used for some fences today. In areas where field stones are plentiful, fences have been built up over the years as the stones are removed from fields during tillage and planting of crops. The stones were placed on the field edge to get them out of the way. In time, the piles of stones grew high and wide.

In other areas, fences were constructed of timber. Log fences or split-rail fences were simple fences constructed in newly cleared areas by stacking log rails. Earth could also be used as a fence; an example was what is now called the sunken fence, or &quot;ha-ha,&quot; a type of wall built by digging a ditch with one steep side (which animals cannot scale) and one sloped side (where the animals roam).
==Fence laws==
The tradition of fencing out unwanted livestock prevails even today in some sparsely populated areas. For example, until the mid-20th century, most states in the American West were called &quot;open range&quot; (&quot;fence out&quot;) states, in contrast to Eastern and Midwestern states which long had &quot;fence in&quot; laws where livestock must be confined by their owners. Though the open range was part of the western tradition, over time, open range was limited long before it was eliminated; first came an obligation to keep cattle from roaming onto state and federal highways, where collisions with fast-moving cars and trucks created a public safety hazard. In addition, voters could voluntarily choose to make certain heavily farmed areas a &quot;herd district,&quot; where livestock needed to be fenced in, a process that also became popular in areas where development of hobby farms created conflicts between large and small landowners. Over time, court cases steadily limited the application of open range law until the present day, where it is the exception rather than the rule in many parts of the American West.

In the United Kingdom, the law is different for private land and common land. On private land it is the owner&#x27;s responsibility to fence livestock in, but it is the responsibility of landowners bordering a common to fence the common&#x27;s livestock out.

Additionally, railways in the UK are fenced to keep livestock and people out, since it is a requirement to do so, unlike many other countries. Either Network Rail or the landowner are responsible for maintaining the fences.

==Fence styles==

===Wire fences===
The principle of wire fences is that they are supported mainly by tension, being stretched between heavy strutted or guy-wired posts at ends, corners, and ideally at intervals in longer stretches (every 50 to 300 metres, 150 to 1000 feet). Between these braced posts are additional smaller wooden or metal posts which keep the wires spaced and upright, usually 3 to 6 metre (10 to 20 feet) apart, depending on the style of fencing used.

Traditionally, wire fencing material is made of galvanized mild steel, but galvanized high-tensile steel is now also used in many places. To prevent sagging of the fence, which raises the risk of entanglement or escape, the wire is tensioned as much as the material will safely allow during construction by various means, including a hand-operated &quot;wire stretcher&quot; or &quot;fence stretcher&quot; (called a &quot;monkey strainer&quot; in some areas) or other leverage devices, a winch, or even by carefully pulling with a tractor or other vehicle.

Wire fences are typically run on wooden posts, either from trees commercially grown in plantations or (particularly in the American West) cut from public lands. When less expensive or more readily available than wood, steel T-posts or star posts are used, usually alternating every 2 to 5 steel posts with a more stable wood post. Non-electrified wire is attached to wooden posts using fencing staples (for intermediate posts, these are fitted loosely, not gripping the wire). Non-electrified wire is held on T-posts by means of wire &quot;clips&quot; made of smooth galvanized wire that wrap around the back of the post and hook onto the wire on either side of the post.

Other than in a truly desert climate, use of rot-resistant wooden posts or steel posts is advised. In the United States, wood with natural rot resistance, such as oak and juniper, was often used until it became in short supply in the 1950s. Then, chemically treated pine and spruce posts became prevalent, and these are also widely used in Britain, together with chestnut. Creosote, pentachlorophenol, and chromated copper arsenate are all widely used in the US and elsewhere for treatment (although some of these chemicals are subject to legal controls).

====Barbed wire====

The Industrial Revolution brought the first barbed wire (also &quot;barbwire&quot; or just &quot;barb&quot;) fences, which were widely used after their introduction in the mid-19th century. This technology made it economically feasible to fence rangeland for the first time. In the United States, introduction of barbed wire contributed to the range wars of that century, as various ranch interests attempted to use barbed wire fences to claim exclusive access to the best pasture and water resources, including those lands in the public domain. It also exacerbated tensions between cattle ranchers and crop farmers, partly when access to water was involved.

Barbed wire has been made by many manufacturers in an almost endless variety of styles. For the most part these were functionally identical. The differences reflected peculiarities of each manufacturing process rather than deliberate design of the end product. Sections of unusual barbed wire are collected by some enthusiasts.

The traditional barbed wire used since the late 19th century and into the present day was made from two mild steel wires twisted together, usually of about 12 or 14 gauge, with about 15-30 twists per metre. Steel barbs were attached every 10–20 cm. Barbs had either two or four points, with the two point design using somewhat heavier and longer barbs. The relative merits of two point vs. four point barbed wire are the subject of deeply held views among many farmers and ranchers, to the extent that both types are still made today.

Typically four strands of barbed wire, with the lowest strand no more than from the ground and the top strand at least 48 inches above the ground, make up a legal fence in the western United States. Better-quality fences have five strands, older fences often had only three strands, and just two strands is widely used in Britain if only adult cattle are being contained. Other variations exist, depending on local laws and the purpose of the fence.

Barbed wire is particularly effective for containing cattle. In pastures containing both cattle and sheep, one or two strands of barbed wire is used in conjunction with woven wire to both discourage cattle from reaching over the top of a fence and to keep sheep from crawling under. Though often used in many areas for horses, barbed wire is not advised; its use is considered poor management. There is very high risk of injury occurring when a thin-skinned, fast-moving animal with long legs runs into it or puts a leg through the strands.

====Smooth wire====

Smooth (or plain) wire is essentially the same product as barbed wire with no barbs – either a two-wire twist or a single strand. Its primary advantage is that it is less likely to cause lacerations and cuts if an animal becomes entangled in it or rubs against it. However, animals will readily lean on mild steel smooth wire, stretching it out of shape or loosening it from the posts, and for this reason it is often used in high-tensile form, which more easily springs back to its original length. Smooth wire fencing is often used as an inexpensive material to safely contain horses and other animals that run a high risk of entanglement, usually in conjunction with a line of electric fence. Smooth wire is also used in securing fence-post braces and other uses where barbed wire is not recommended

====High tensile wire====
High tensile (H-T or HT) fencing is a special hard, springy steel wire that was introduced in the 1970s and has slowly gained acceptance. The wire may be a single strand plain or barbed wire, or woven mesh, and is capable of much higher tension than mild steel. It permits the use of wider post spacings and is neither stretched easily by animals, nor by fallen trees or branches. It can be insulated and electrified. Because of the wide spacing of the posts, thin metal or wood spacers (or &quot;droppers&quot;) may be attached to the wires between posts to maintain their spacing.

Joining HT wire is difficult because of its stiffness and its reduction in strength when bent sharply. However, it may be joined effectively with proprietary clips. HT wire is more expensive than mild steel, but because of the need for fewer posts, the overall cost of the fencing is usually comparable.

Because it does not stretch, animals are less likely to become entangled in HT wire. However, for the same reason, if an animal does become entangled or runs into a few strands at a high speed, it can be deadly, and is sometimes referred to as having a &quot;cheese cutter&quot; effect on the animal.

Trellising for horticultural purposes is generally constructed from HT wire as it is able to withstand a higher crop load without breaking or stretching.

====Woven and mesh wire====

Woven and mesh wire fencing material has smooth horizontal wires and vertical wires (called stays). Wire spacing and height of fence is dependent on which type of animal is being contained. Agricultural woven wire is identifiable by wire &quot;knots&quot; wrapped around each intersecting wire. Mesh wire material is spot welded at each junction. Woven wire and mesh wire fences are also called square wire, box wire, page wire, sheep fence, or hog fence in the United States, sheep netting or pig netting in Britain, and ringlock in Australia.

Barbed wire fences cannot effectively contain smaller livestock such as pigs, goats or sheep. Where these animals are to be fenced, woven wire is used instead, sometimes with one or more strands of barbed wire at the top, and sometimes at the bottom to prevent animals from pushing under. For swine, a ground-level barbed wire strand or electrified wire is used as well to prevent digging beneath the fence.

Woven wire with large openings has some potential hazards. Large hoofed animals can put a foot through wide squares while grazing along the edge of the fenceline or while reaching over it, and then become tangled in the fence. A variation, called &quot;field fence,&quot; has narrower openings at the bottom and wider openings at the top, which helps prevent animals from putting their feet through the fence. For example, horses in particular are safer kept inside woven wire fence with smaller openings, such as &quot;no climb&quot; fence with openings no larger than two inches by four inches.

==== Hog panel ====
Hog panels or cattle panels consist of heavy wire approximately or more in diameter running horizontal and vertical, and welded at the intersections. The panels, which are sold in lengths of 16 ft or 8 ft rather than in rolls, are rigid and self-supporting. No corner bracing is needed with panels as they are not stretched and there is no tension on corner posts.

====Chain link====
Chain link fencing is occasionally used for some livestock containment. However, due to cost, it is not particularly common for fencing large areas where less-expensive forms of woven wire are equally suitable. When used in small enclosures, it is easily deformed by livestock, resulting in high ongoing maintenance costs.

===Electric fence===
Electric fencing became widely available in the 1950s and has been widely used both for temporary fences and as a means to improve the security of fences made of other materials. It is most commonly made using lightweight steel wire (usually 14-17 gauge) attached to posts with insulators made of porcelain or plastic. Synthetic web or rope with thin steel wires interwoven to carry the electrical charge has become popular in recent years, particularly where additional visibility is desired.

A fence charger places an electrical pulse from ground to the wire about once per second. The pulse is narrow and usually around 5-20 kV. Animals receive an uncomfortable but harmless shock when contacting the wire, and learn to stay away from it.
=== Synthetic fence ===


Synthetic fences encompass a wide range of products. Vinyl-coated wire fence is usually based on high-tensile wire with a vinyl coating. Some forms are non-electric, others embed layers of graphite to carry a current from the wire to the outside of the coated product so that it can be electrified. It can be of any color, with white particularly common in the United States so that the fencing is visible to livestock. Most forms can be installed on either wood posts or steel t-posts.

A variant, sometimes called &quot;vinyl rail&quot; or &quot;strap fencing&quot; consists of two or more vinyl-encased wires with vinyl or other synthetic between them to create a &quot;rail&quot; that is anywhere from wide. Some forms may be electrified by use of a special coating on the top wire of the &quot;rail.&quot;

Vinyl fence is installed in a manner similar to plain high-tensile fence and must be stretched tight. Strong bracing of posts at corners and in the middle of long fencelines is required. Like other wire fences, keeping vinyl fencing tightened on a regular basis is key to safety and appearance.

A mesh form of vinyl fencing without internal wires is marketed as &quot;deer fence&quot; and used in some locations to augment other fencing to keep out wild animals. There are also some forms of vinyl fencing that look similar to vinyl-coated wire, but do not contain an internal wire, that are marketed to livestock owners. They are marketed as particularly safe, but their strength in containing animals is under debate.

===Wood, pipe and other materials ===

Fences of wood, stranded cable, and pipe are used where cost is less of a consideration, particularly on horse farms, or in pens or corrals where livestock are likely to challenge the fence. Synthetic materials with wood-like qualities are also used, though they are the most expensive option in most situations. In some areas, these types of fencing materials can be cost-effective if plentiful. For example, scrap pipe is often easily obtained at a low price if oil fields are nearby, and wooden rails can sometimes be harvested from the owner&#x27;s own land if it contains suitable standing timber.

A cattle grid is an obstacle used to prevent livestock, such as sheep, beeves, pigs, horses, or mules from passing along a road or railway which penetrates the fencing surrounding an enclosed piece of land or border.

==Maintenance==

All types of agricultural fencing require regular maintenance to ensure their effectiveness. Cattle and horses are strong enough to go through most types of fence by main force, and occasionally do so when frightened or motivated by hunger, thirst, or sex drive. Weather, flood, fire, and damage from vandals or motor vehicle accidents can do similar damage and may allow livestock to escape.

==Wildlife issues==

All types of livestock fencing can be barriers and traps for wildlife, causing injuries and fatalities. Wildlife can get their legs tangled in barbed wire or woven wire with a strand of barbed on top. Woven wire can barricade animals that cannot jump the fence but are too large to crawl through the holes, such as fawns, bears and bobcats. Some wire fences are too difficult to see for larger fast moving birds, which can get entangled in it.

Adding visibility to wire fences can help reduce wildlife collisions. Reducing the height of woven and strand wire fences to no more than 40 inches can make it easier for wildlife to jump over with less risk of entanglement. Using barbless wires on top and bottom reduces cuts on wildlife which crawl under strand fences or those that try to climb over.

Fladry lines, made of cloth, metal and/or other materials, are sometimes used on fences to discourage wolves from entering a livestock enclosure.

Deer and many goats can easily jump an ordinary agricultural fence, and so special fencing is needed for farming goats or deer, or to keep wild deer out of farmland and gardens. Deer fence is often made of lightweight woven wire netting nearly high on lightweight posts, otherwise made like an ordinary woven wire fence. In areas where such a tall fence is unsuitable (for example, on mountains subject to very high winds), deer may be excluded (or contained) by a fence of ordinary height (about ), with a smaller one of about high, about away from it, on the same side as the deer. The additional width prevents deer approaching the fence close enough to jump it.

<text>Livonian ( or ) is a Finnic language whose native land is the Livonian Coast of the Gulf of Riga, located in the north of the Kurzeme peninsula in Latvia but also used to be spoken in the Salaca River valley. Although its last known native speaker died in 2013, a child, Kuldi Medne, born in 2020 is reported to be a native speaker of Livonian. Her parents are Livonian language revival activists Jānis Mednis and Renāte Medne. Also, there are about 40 reported L2 speakers and 210 having reported some knowledge of the language. Possibly uniquely among the Uralic languages but similarly to Latvian and Lithuanian, Livonian has been described as a pitch-accent language (or &quot;restricted tone language&quot;, see below).
Some ethnic Livonians are learning or have learned Livonian in an attempt to revive it, but because ethnic Livonians are a small minority, opportunities to use Livonian are limited. The Estonian newspaper erroneously announced that Viktors Bertholds, who died on 28 February 2009, was the last native speaker who started Latvian-language school as a monolingual. Some other Livonians had argued, however, that there were some native speakers left, including Viktors Bertholds&#x27; cousin, Grizelda Kristiņa, who died in 2013. An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. In a 2009 conference proceeding, it was mentioned that there could be &quot;at best 10 living native&quot; speakers of the language.

The promotion of the Livonian language as a living language has been advanced mostly by the Livonian Cultural Centre (), an organisation of mostly young Livonians. Livonian as a lesser used language in Latvia – along with Latgalian – is represented by the Latvian Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (LatBLUL), formerly a national branch of the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (EBLUL).

The language is taught in universities in Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, which constantly increases the pool of people with some knowledge of the language who do not permanently reside in Latvia.

== History ==

In the 19th century, about 2,000 people still spoke Livonian; in 1852, the number of Livonians was 2,394. Various historical events have led to the near total language death of Livonian:
* In the 13th century, speakers of Livonian numbered 30,000.
* The German invasion: around the year 1200, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Teutonic knights conquered Livonia, leading to contention of rule of the area between these orders and the Archbishopric of Riga.
* 1522: The introduction of the Protestant Reformation. 
* 1557: The Russian invasion, also known as the Russo-Swedish War.
* 1558–1583: Livonian War. Russians, Swedes, Danes, Lithuanians and Poles fought over the area.
* 1721: The Treaty of Nystad. Northern Livonia became provinces of Tsarist Russia.
* 1918: The founding of Latvia; the Livonian language re-blossomed.
* World War II and Soviet Union: marginalisation of Livonian.
* Declared extinct on 6 June 2013.
*Revival of the Livonian language started after the last native speaker died.

In the 13th century, the native Livonians inhabited all the areas around the Gulf of Riga, except for the Estonian island of Saaremaa. In the 12th–13th centuries the Livonian lands were conquered by the Teutonic Order. The conquest led to a strong decrease in the number of speakers of the Livonian language, empty Livonian lands inhabited by the Latvians, which contributed to the replacement of the Livonian language in favor of Latvian. It is estimated that at the time of the German colonization, there were 30,000 Livonians. In the 19th century the number of speakers of the Couronian dialect is estimated as follows: 2,074 people in 1835, 2,324 people in 1852, 2,390 people in 1858, 2,929 people in 1888. According to the Soviet Census of 1989, 226 people were Livonian, and almost half of them spoke Livonian. According to estimates of the Liv Culture Center in 2010, only 40 people spoke Livonian in everyday life. In 2013, there were none who spoke Livonian in everyday life.

===Early literature===
The first Livonian words were recorded in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry. The first written sources about Livonian appeared in the 16th century. The collection of Livonian poems &quot;Mariners sacred songs and prayers&quot; () was translated to Latvian by Jānis Prints and his son Jānis Jr. and was published in 1845. The first book in Livonian was the Gospel of Matthew, published in 1863 in London in both the eastern and western Courland dialects. It was translated into eastern Curonian by Nick Pollmann and into western Curonian by Jānis Prints and Peteris. The plan with the book was to establish a standard orthography by F. Wiedemann, which consisted of 36 letters with many diacritics. The total circulation was 250 copies. The Livonians received only one copy of each dialect. The second book in Livonian was the same Gospel of Matthew, published in 1880 in St. Petersburg, with an orthography based on Latvian and German.

In the interwar period, there were several dozen books published in Livonian, mainly with the help of Finnish and Estonian organizations. In 1930, the first newspaper in Livonian, &quot;, was published. In 1942, a translation of the New Testament was published in Helsinki. It was translated by Kōrli Stalte, with help from the Finnish linguist Lauri Kettunen. After WWII, books in Livonian were no longer published, as Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union. The whole area of the Livonian Coast became a restricted border zone under tight Soviet supervision. Coastal fishing was gradually eliminated in the smaller villages and concentrated in the larger population centres of Kolka, Roja, and Ventspils. Limits were placed on freedom of movement for inhabitants. All of these factors contributed to the decline of the language, although some initiatives appeared from the early 1970s onwards.

After Latvia regained its independence, the newsletter &quot; was published in Livonian in 1994, dedicated to the Livonian culture, art, and figures of the national movement, and in 1998 with the support of the &quot;Open Society,&quot; the first collection of poetry in Livonian, &quot;&quot;, was published and presented in Finland and Estonia. It combines the works of famous Livonian poets. To date, the only Livonian media outlet is the trilingual (English-Latvian-Livonian) Livones.lv (livones.net) operated by the Liv Culture Center.

Two sites were included in the Atlas Linguarum Europae to study Livonian: Miķeļtornis and Mazirbe.

===Speakers of Livonian in the twenty-first century===
Viktors Bertholds (10 July 1921 – 28 February 2009), one of the last Livonian speakers of the generation who learnt Livonian as a first language in a Livonian-speaking family and community, died on 28 February 2009. Though it was reported that he was the last native speaker of the language, Livonians themselves claimed that there were more native speakers still alive, albeit very few.

As reported in the Estonian newspaper , Viktors Bertholds was born in 1921 and probably belonged to the last generation of children who started their (Latvian-medium) primary school as Livonian monolinguals; only a few years later it was noted that Livonian parents had begun to speak Latvian with their children. During World War II, Bertholds, unlike most Livonian men, managed to avoid being mobilized in the armies of either occupation force by hiding in the woods. After the war, Bertholds worked in various professions and shared his knowledge of the Livonian language with many field linguists; in the 1990s, he also taught Livonian in children&#x27;s summer camps.

Bertholds&#x27; Livonian-speaking brother and wife died in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, many other prominent &quot;last Livonians&quot; also died, such as Poulin Klavin (1918–2001), keeper of many Livonian traditions and the last Livonian to reside permanently on the Courland coast, and Edgar Vaalgamaa (1912–2003), clergyman in Finland, translator of the New Testament and author of a book on the history and culture of the Livonians.

The last native speaker of Livonian was Grizelda Kristiņa, née Bertholde (1910–2013, a cousin of Viktors Bertholds), who lived in Canada from 1949. According to linguist and activist Valts Ernštreits, she spoke Livonian as well &quot;as if she had stepped out of her home farm in a Livonian coastal village just yesterday&quot; and qualified as the last living native speaker of the Livonian language of her generation. She died on June 2, 2013.

The survival of the Livonian language now depends on young Livonians who learnt Livonian in their childhood from grandparents or great-grandparents of the pre-war generations. There are not many of them, though there are a few hundred ethnic Livonians in Latvia now who are interested in their Livonian roots. Some young Livonians not only sing folk-songs in Livonian but even strive to use Livonian actively in everyday communication. One such younger generation Livonian speaker is , who performs with the Livonian-Estonian world music group . In 2018, the Livonian Institute at the University of Latvia () was established to promote research and awareness of the language. It is led by Valts Ernštreits.

In 2020 Livonian language revival activists Jānis Mednis and Renāte Medne started teaching Livonian as the first language to their newborn daughter Kuldi Medne. As of 2023 she was the only Livonian native speaker in Latvia. In October 2022, her parents published (&#x27;Golden Child&#x27;), a book in Livonian and Latvian for children and parents, with plans for subsequent books and an audio version. 

2023 was proclaimed as Livonian Heritage Year () by the UoL Livonian Institute in cooperation with the UNESCO Latvian National Commission and the Latvian National Cultural Center, with various events held by individuals and institutions. In January 2023, the first of 171 approved road signs in Latvia with Latvian and Livonian text were placed on the border of Talsi Municipality. Similar signs are being placed in Latgale featuring Latgalian. During the 2023 Latvian Song and Dance Festival, for the first time in the history of the event, a song with Livonian lyrics was featured. (Latvian: &#x27;Livonians are coming&#x27;), the second part of the musical cycle by and was performed during the Grand Choir Concert .

==Phonology==
Livonian, like Estonian, has lost vowel harmony, but unlike Estonian, it has also lost consonant gradation.

===Vowels===
Livonian has 8 vowels in the table below. Additionally two archaic vowels are given in parentheses:


All vowels can be long or short. Short vowels are written as indicated in the table; long vowels are written with an additional macron (&quot;ˉ&quot;) over the letter, so, for example, = . The Livonian vowel system is notable for having a &quot;stød&quot; similar to Danish. As in other languages with this feature, it is thought to be a vestige of an earlier pitch accent.

Livonian has also a large number of diphthongs, as well as a number of triphthongs. These can also occur as short or long.

The two opening diphthongs and vary in their stress placement depending on length: short , are realized as rising , , while long , are realized as falling , . The same applies to the triphthongs : .

===Consonants===
Livonian has 23 consonants:


 are restricted to loans, except for some interjections containing . Voiced obstruents are subject to being either devoiced or half-voiced in the word-final position, or before another unvoiced consonants ( &quot;third&quot;).

== Alphabet ==
The Livonian alphabet is a hybrid which mixes Latvian and Estonian orthography.

==Grammar==
==Language contacts with Latvians and Estonians==
Livonian has for centuries been thoroughly influenced by Latvian in terms of grammar, phonology and word derivation etc. The dative case in Livonian, for example, is very unusual for a Finnic language. There are about 2,000 Latvian and 200 Low Saxon and German loanwords in Livonian and most of the Germanic loanwords were adopted through Latvian. Latvian, however, was influenced by Livonian as well. Its regular syllable stress, which is based on Livonian, is very unusual in a Baltic language. Especially as of the end of the nineteenth century there was a great deal of contact with Estonians, namely between (Kurzeme) Livonian fishers or mariners and the Estonians from Saaremaa or other islands. Many inhabitants of the islands of Western Estonia worked in the summer in Kurzeme Livonian villages. As a result, a knowledge of Estonian spread among those Livonians and words of Estonian origin also came into Livonian. There are about 800 Estonian loanwords in Livonian, most of which were borrowed from the Saaremaa dialect.

==Common phrases==
* Hello! – 
* Enjoy your meal! – 
* Good morning! – &#x27;/&#x27;
* Good day! – &#x27;/&#x27;
* Good night! – 
* Thank you! – 
* Happy new year! – 
* one – 
* two – 
* three – 
* four –

* eleven - 
* twelve - 
* thirteen - 
* fourteen - 
* fifteen - 
* sixteen - 
* seventeen - 
* eighteen - 
* nineteen - 
* twenty - 

== Revitalization ==
The Livonian language once spoken on about a third of modern-day Latvian territory, died in the 21st century with the death of the last native speaker Grizelda Kristiņa on 2 June 2013. Today there are about 210 people mainly living in Latvia who identify themselves as Livonian and speak the language on the A1-A2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and between 20 and 40 people who speak the language on level B1 and up. Today all speakers learn Livonian as a second language. There are different programs educating Latvians on the cultural and linguistic heritage of Livonians and the fact that most Latvians have common Livonian descent.
Programs worth mentioning include:
* Livones.net with extensive information about language, history and culture
* The Livonian Institute of the University of Latvia doing research on the Livonian language, other Finnic languages in Latvia and providing an extensive Livonian-Latvian-Estonian dictionary with declinations/conjugations
* Virtual Livonia providing information on the Livonian language and especially its grammar
* : An annual summer camp for children to teach children about the Livonian language, culture etc.
* (Livonian Union)

<text>Colubridae (, commonly known as colubrids , from , &#x27;snake&#x27;) is a family of snakes. With 249 genera, it is the largest snake family. The earliest fossil species of the family date back to the Late Eocene epoch, with earlier origins suspected. Colubrid snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica.

==Description==
Colubrids are a very diverse group of snakes. They can exhibit many different body styles, body sizes, colors, and patterns. They can also live in many different types of habitats including aquatic, terrestrial, semi-arboreal, arboreal, desert, mountainous forests, semi-fossorial, and brackish waters. 
A primarily shy and harmless group of snakes, the vast majority of colubrids are not venomous, nor do most colubrids produce venom that is medically significant to mammals. However, the bites of a few groups (such as &quot;Boiga&quot; sp.) can escalate quickly to emergency situations. Furthermore, within the Colubridae, the South African boomslang and twig snakes, as well as the Asian keelback snakes (&quot;Rhabdophis&quot; sp.) have long been notorious for inflicting the worst bites on humans, with the most confirmed fatalities.

Some colubrids are described as &quot;opisthoglyphous&quot; (often simply called &quot;rear-fanged&quot;), meaning they possess shortened, grooved &quot;fangs&quot; located at the back of the upper jaw. It is thought that opisthoglyphy evolved many times throughout the natural history of squamates and is an evolutionary precursor to the larger, frontal fangs of vipers and elapids. These grooved fangs tend to be sharpest on the anterior and posterior edges. While feeding, colubrids move their jaws backward to create a cutting motion between the posterior edge and the prey&#x27;s tissue. In order to inject venom, colubridae must chew on their prey. Colubrids can also be proteroglyphous (fangs at the front of the upper jaw, followed by small solid teeth)

Most Colubridae are oviparous (mode of reproduction where an egg is produced that will later hatch) with clutch size varying by size and species of snake. However, certain species of snakes from the subfamilies of Natricinae and Colubrinae are viviparous (mode of reproduction where young are live birthed). These viviparous species can birth various amounts of offspring at a time, but the exact number of offspring depends on the size and species of snake.

==Characteristics of Colubridae==
Characteristics of Colubridae include limbless bodies, left lung that is reduced or absent with or without a tracheal lung, well-developed oviducts, premaxillaries that lack teeth, maxilaries oriented longitudinally with teeth that are solid or grooved, mandible without a coronoid bone, dentary that has teeth, only a left carotid artery, intracostal arteries arising from the dorsal aorta every few trunk segments, no cranial infrared receptors occurring in pits or surface indentations, and optic foramina that typically traverse the frontal–parietal–parasphenoid sutures.

==Classification==
In the past, the Colubridae were not a natural group, as many were more closely related to other groups, such as elapids, than to each other. This family was historically used as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot; for snakes that do not fit elsewhere. Until recently, colubrids were basically colubroids that were not elapids, viperids, or &quot;Atractaspis&quot;.

However, recent research in molecular phylogenetics has stabilized the classification of historically &quot;colubrid&quot; snakes and the family as currently defined is a monophyletic clade, although additional research will be necessary to sort out all the relationships within this group. As of May 2018, eight subfamilies are recognized.

===Current subfamilies===

Sibynophiinae – three genera
Natricinae – 36 genera (sometimes given as family Natricidae)


Pseudoxenodontinae – two genera
Dipsadinae – over 100 genera (sometimes given as family Dipsadidae)

Grayiinae – one genus
* &quot;Grayia&quot;

Calamariinae – seven genera
Ahaetuliinae – five genera
Colubrinae – 93 genera

Sub-family currently undetermined
===Former subfamilies===
These taxa have been at one time or another classified as part of the Colubridae, but are now either classified as parts of other families, or are no longer accepted because all the species within them have been moved to other (sub)families.
* Subfamily Aparallactinae (now a subfamily of Lamprophiidae, sometimes combined with Atractaspidinae)
* Subfamily Boiginae (now part of Colubrinae)
* Subfamily Boodontinae (some of which now treated as subfamily Grayiinae of the new Colubridae, others moved to family Lamprophiidae as part of subfamilies Lamprophiinae, Pseudaspidinae and Pseudoxyrhophiidae, which are now sometimes treated as families)
* Subfamily Dispholidinae (now part of Colubrinae)
* Subfamily Homalopsinae (now family Homalopsidae)
* Subfamily Lamprophiinae (now a subfamily of Lamprophiidae)
* Subfamily Lycodontinae (now part of Colubrinae)
* Subfamily Lycophidinae (now part of Lamprophiidae)
* Subfamily Pareatinae (now family Pareidae, sometimes incorrectly spelled Pareatidae)
* Subfamily Philothamninae (now part of Colubrinae)
* Subfamily Psammophiinae (now a subfamily of Lamprophiidae)
* Subfamily Pseudoxyrhophiinae (now a subfamily of Lamprophiidae)
* Subfamily Xenoderminae (now family Xenodermidae, sometimes incorrectly spelled Xenodermatidae)
* Subfamily Xenodontinae (which many authors put in Dipsadinae/Dipsadidae)

==Fossil record==
The oldest colubrid fossils are indeterminate vertebrae from Thailand and specimens of the genus &quot;Nebraskophis&quot; from the U.S. state of Georgia, both from the Late Eocene. The presence of derived colubrids in North America so early on, despite their presumed Old World origins, suggests that they originated even earlier. The Pliocene (Blancan) fossil record in the Ringold Formation of Adams County, Washington has yielded fossils from a number of colubrids including &quot;Elaphe pliocenica&quot;, &quot;Elaphe vulpina&quot;, &quot;Lampropeltis getulus&quot;, &quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;, a &quot;Thamnophis&quot; species, and the extinct genus &quot;Tauntonophis&quot;.

<text>A road surface (British English) or pavement (North American English) is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, macadam, hoggin, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the beginning of the 20th century and are of two types: metalled (hard-surfaced) and unmetalled roads. Metalled roadways are made to sustain vehicular load and so are usually made on frequently used roads. Unmetalled roads, also known as gravel roads or dirt roads, are rough and can sustain less weight. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic.

Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways to prevent flooding. Pavements are crucial to countries such as United States and Canada, which heavily depend on road transportation. Therefore, research projects such as Long-Term Pavement Performance have been launched to optimize the life cycle of different road surfaces.

Pavement, in construction, is an outdoor floor or superficial surface covering. Paving materials include asphalt, concrete, stones such as flagstone, cobblestone, and setts, artificial stone, bricks, tiles, and sometimes wood. In landscape architecture, pavements are part of the hardscape and are used on sidewalks, road surfaces, patios, courtyards, etc.

The term &quot;pavement&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning a floor beaten or rammed down, through Old French &quot;pavement&quot;. The meaning of a beaten-down floor was obsolete before the word entered English.

Pavement, in the form of beaten gravel, dates back before the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Pavement laid in patterns like mosaics were commonly used by the Romans.

The bearing capacity and service life of a pavement can be raised dramatically by arranging good drainage by an open ditch or covered drains to reduce moisture content in the pavements subbase and subgrade.

==Development==

Wheeled transport created the need for better roads. Generally, natural materials cannot be both soft enough to form well-graded surfaces and strong enough to bear wheeled vehicles, especially when wet, and stay intact. In urban areas it began to be worthwhile to build stone-paved streets and, in fact, the first paved streets appear to have been built in Ur in 4000 BC. Corduroy roads were built in Glastonbury, England in 3300 BC, and brick-paved roads were built in the Indus Valley Civilisation on the Indian subcontinent from around the same time. Improvements in metallurgy meant that by 2000 BC stone-cutting tools were generally available in the Middle East and Greece allowing local streets to be paved. Notably, in about 2000 BC, the Minoans built a 50 km paved road from Knossos in northern Crete through the mountains to Gortyn and Lebena, a port on the south coast of the island, which had side drains, a 200 mm thick pavement of sandstone blocks bound with clay-gypsum mortar, covered by a layer of basaltic flagstones and had separate shoulders. This road could be considered superior to any Roman road. Roman roads varied from simple corduroy roads to paved roads using deep roadbeds of tamped rubble as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from between the stones and fragments of rubble, instead of becoming mud in clay soils.

Although there were attempts to rediscover Roman methods, there was little useful innovation in road building before the 18th century. The first professional road builder to emerge during the Industrial Revolution was John Metcalf, who constructed about of turnpike road, mainly in the north of England, from 1765, when Parliament passed an act authorising the creation of turnpike trusts to build toll funded roads in the Knaresborough area.

Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet is widely credited with establishing the first scientific approach to road building in France at the same time as Metcalf. He wrote a memorandum on his method in 1775, which became general practice in France. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel.

By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, new methods of highway construction had been pioneered by the work of two British engineers: Thomas Telford and John Loudon McAdam. Telford&#x27;s method of road building involved the digging of a large trench in which a foundation of heavy rock was set. He designed his roads so that they sloped downwards from the centre, allowing drainage to take place, a major improvement on the work of Trésaguet. The surface of his roads consisted of broken stone. McAdam developed an inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (known as macadam). His road building method was simpler than Telford&#x27;s, yet more effective at protecting roadways: he discovered that massive foundations of rock upon rock were unnecessary, and asserted that native soil alone would support the road and traffic upon it, as long as it was covered by a road crust that would protect the soil underneath from water and wear. Size of stones was central to McAdam&#x27;s road building theory. The lower road thickness was restricted to stones no larger than .

Modern tarmac was patented by British civil engineer Edgar Purnell Hooley, who noticed that spilled tar on the roadway kept the dust down and created a smooth surface. He took out a patent in 1901 for tarmac. Hooley&#x27;s 1901 patent for tarmac involved mechanically mixing tar and aggregate prior to lay-down, and then compacting the mixture with a steamroller. The tar was modified by adding small amounts of Portland cement, resin, and pitch.

==Asphalt==

Asphalt (specifically, asphalt concrete), sometimes called flexible pavement since its viscosity causes minute deformations as it distributes loads, has been widely used since the 1920s. The viscous nature of the bitumen binder allows asphalt concrete to sustain significant plastic deformation, although fatigue from repeated loading over time is the most common failure mechanism. Most asphalt surfaces are laid on a gravel base, which is generally at least as thick as the asphalt layer, although some &#x27;full depth&#x27; asphalt surfaces are laid directly on the native subgrade. In areas with very soft or expansive subgrades such as clay or peat, thick gravel bases or stabilization of the subgrade with Portland cement or lime may be required. Polypropylene and polyester geosynthetics are also used for this purpose, and in some northern countries a layer of polystyrene boards are used to delay and minimize frost penetration into the subgrade.

Depending on the temperature at which it is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, half warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of , resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool too much on the long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.

An asphalt concrete surface will generally be constructed for high-volume primary highways having an average annual daily traffic load greater than 1,200 vehicles per day. Advantages of asphalt roadways include relatively low noise, relatively low cost compared with other paving methods, and perceived ease of repair. Disadvantages include less durability than other paving methods, less tensile strength than concrete, the tendency to become slick and soft in hot weather, and a certain amount of hydrocarbon pollution to soil and groundwater or waterways.In the mid-1960s, rubberized asphalt was used for the first time, mixing crumb rubber from used tires with asphalt. While a potential use for tires that would otherwise fill landfills and present a fire hazard, rubberized asphalt has shown greater incidence of wear in freeze-thaw cycles in temperate zones because of the non-homogeneous expansion and contraction with non-rubber components. The application of rubberized asphalt is more temperature-sensitive and in many locations can only be applied at certain times of the year. Study results of the long-term acoustic benefits of rubberized asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of rubberized asphalt may provide a reduction of 3–5 decibels (dB) in tire-pavement-source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 dB in total traffic-noise reduction when combined with the other components of traffic noise. Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), rubberized asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.

==Concrete==

Concrete surfaces (specifically, Portland cement concrete) are created using a concrete mix of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, sand, and water. In virtually all modern mixes there will also be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions, and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases there will also be Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.

Concrete surfaces have been classified into three common types: jointed plain (JPCP), jointed reinforced (JRCP) and continuously reinforced (CRCP). The one item that distinguishes each type is the jointing system used to control crack development.

One of the major advantages of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. The surface can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. Concrete roads are more economical to drive in terms of fuel consumption, they reflect light better, and they last significantly longer than other paving surfaces; but they have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern paving methods and design methods have changed the economics of concrete paving so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be cheaper in initial cost and significantly cheaper over the life cycle. Another important advantage is that waterproof concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains next to the road and reduces the need for a slightly sloped driveway to drain rainwater. Avoiding rainwater discharge by using runoff also means less electricity is needed (otherwise more pumps would be needed in the water distribution system) and rainwater is not polluted because it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the earth. A previous disadvantage was that they had a higher initial cost and could be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement and the higher cost of bitumen. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.

The first street in the United States to be paved with concrete was Court Avenue in Bellefontaine, Ohio in 1893. The first mile of concrete pavement in the United States was on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan in 1909. Following these pioneering uses, the Lincoln Highway Association, established in October 1913 to oversee the creation of one of the United States&#x27; earliest east-west transcontinental highways for the automobile, began to establish &quot;seedling miles&quot; of specifically concrete-paved roadbed in various places in the American Midwest, starting in 1914 west of Malta, Illinois, while using concrete with the specified concrete &quot;ideal section&quot; for the Lincoln Highway in Lake County, Indiana, during 1922 and 1923.

Concrete roadways may produce more noise than asphalt from tire noise on cracks and expansion joints. A concrete pavement composed of multiple slabs of uniform size will produce a periodic sound and vibration in each vehicle as its tires pass over each expansion joint. These monotonous repeated sounds and vibrations can cause a fatiguing or hypnotic effect upon the driver over the course of a long journey.

==Composite pavement==

Composite pavements combine a Portland cement concrete sublayer with an asphalt overlay. They are usually used to rehabilitate existing roadways rather than in new construction. Asphalt overlays are sometimes laid over distressed concrete to restore a smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes &quot;reflective cracks&quot; in the asphalt. 

To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a &quot;break and seat,&quot; &quot;crack and seat&quot;, or &quot;rubblization&quot; process. Geosynthetics can be used for reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement and the size of the resulting pieces. The theory is that frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. &quot;Rubblization&quot; is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.

The whitetopping process uses Portland cement concrete to resurface a distressed asphalt road.

==Recycling==

Distressed pavement can be reused when rehabilitating a roadway. The existing pavement is broken up and may be ground on-site through a process called milling. This pavement is commonly referred to as reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). RAP can be transported to an asphalt plant, where it will be stockpiled for use in new pavement mixes, or it may be recycled in-place using the techniques described below. 

===In-place recycling methods===
*Rubblizing of pavement: Existing concrete pavement is milled into gravel-sized particles. Any steel reinforcing is removed, and the ground pavement is compacted to form the base and/or sub-base layers for new asphalt pavement. Ground pavement may also be compacted for use on gravel roads.  
*Cold in-place recycling: Bituminous pavement is ground or milled into small particles. The asphalt millings are blended with asphalt emulsion, foamed bitumen, or soft bitumen to rejuvenate the aged asphalt binder. New aggregate may also be added. The resulting asphalt mix is paved and compacted. It may serve as the top pavement layer, or it may be overlaid with new asphalt after curing.
*Hot in-place recycling: Bituminous pavement is heated to , milled, combined with a rejuvenating agent and/or virgin asphalt binder, and compacted. It may then be overlaid with new asphalt concrete. This process typically recycles the top or less and may be used to correct surface defects, such as rutting or polishing. To preserve the condition of the asphalt binder and avoid excessive hydrocarbon emissions, heating is typically achieved gradually through the use of infrared or hot air heaters.
*Full depth reclamation: The full thickness of the asphalt pavement and underlying material is pulverized to provide a uniform blend of material. A binding agent or stabilizing material may be mixed in to form a base course for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a sub-base course. Common binding agents include asphalt emulsion, fly ash, hydrated lime, Portland cement, and calcium chloride. Virgin aggregate, RAP, or crushed Portland cement may also be added to improve the gradation and mechanical properties of the mix. This technique is typically used to address structural failures in the pavement, such as alligator cracking, deep rutting, and shoulder drop-off.

==Bituminous surface==
Bituminous surface treatment (BST) or chipseal is used mainly on low-traffic roads, but also as a sealing coat to rejuvenate an asphalt concrete pavement. It generally consists of aggregate spread over a sprayed-on asphalt emulsion or cut-back asphalt cement. The aggregate is then embedded into the asphalt by rolling it, typically with a rubber-tired roller. This type of surface is described by a wide variety of regional terms including &quot;chip seal&quot;, &quot;tar and chip&quot;, &quot;oil and stone&quot;, &quot;seal coat&quot;, &quot;sprayed seal&quot;, &quot;surface dressing&quot;, &quot;microsurfacing&quot;, &quot;seal&quot;, or simply as &quot;bitumen&quot;.

BST is used on hundreds of miles of the Alaska Highway and other similar roadways in Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and northern British Columbia. The ease of application of BST is one reason for its popularity, but another is its flexibility, which is important when roadways are laid down over unstable terrain that thaws and softens in the spring.

Other types of BSTs include micropaving, slurry seals and Novachip. These are laid down using specialized and proprietary equipment. They are most often used in urban areas where the roughness and loose stone associated with chip seals is considered undesirable.

===Thin membrane surface===
A thin membrane surface (TMS) is an oil-treated aggregate which is laid down upon a gravel road bed, producing a dust-free road. A TMS road reduces mud problems and provides stone-free roads for local residents where loaded truck traffic is negligible. The TMS layer adds no significant structural strength, and so is used on secondary highways with low traffic volume and minimal weight loading. Construction involves minimal subgrade preparation, following by covering with a cold mix asphalt aggregate. The Operation Division of the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure in Saskatchewan has the responsibility of maintaining of thin membrane surface (TMS) highways.

===Otta seal===
Otta seal is a low-cost road surface using a mixture of bitumen and crushed rock.

== Gravel surface ==
Gravel is known to have been used extensively in the construction of roads by soldiers of the Roman Empire (see Roman road) but in 1998 a limestone-surfaced road, thought to date back to the Bronze Age, was found at Yarnton in Oxfordshire, Britain. Applying gravel, or &quot;metalling&quot;, has had two distinct usages in road surfacing. The term road metal refers to the broken stone or cinders used in the construction or repair of roads or railways, and is derived from the Latin &quot;metallum&quot;, which means both &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;quarry&quot;. The term originally referred to the process of creating a gravel roadway. The route of the roadway would first be dug down several feet and, depending on local conditions, French drains may or may not have been added. Next, large stones were placed and compacted, followed by successive layers of smaller stones, until the road surface was composed of small stones compacted into a hard, durable surface. &quot;Road metal&quot; later became the name of stone chippings mixed with tar to form the road-surfacing material tarmac. A road of such material is called a &quot;metalled road&quot; in Britain, a &quot;paved road&quot; in Canada and the US, or a &quot;sealed road&quot; in parts of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

A granular surface can be used with a traffic volume where the annual average daily traffic is 1,200 vehicles per day or less. There is some structural strength if the road surface combines a sub base and base and is topped with a double-graded seal aggregate with emulsion. Besides the of granular pavements maintained in Saskatchewan, around 40% of New Zealand roads are unbound granular pavement structures.

The decision whether to pave a gravel road or not often hinges on traffic volume. It has been found that maintenance costs for gravel roads often exceed the maintenance costs for paved or surface-treated roads when traffic volumes exceed 200 vehicles per day.

Some communities are finding it makes sense to convert their low-volume paved roads to aggregate surfaces.

==Other surfaces==
Pavers (or paviours), generally in the form of pre-cast concrete blocks, are often used for aesthetic purposes, or sometimes at port facilities that see long-duration pavement loading. Pavers are rarely used in areas that see high-speed vehicle traffic.

Brick, cobblestone, sett, wood plank, and wood block pavements such as Nicolson pavement, were once common in urban areas throughout the world, but fell out of fashion in most countries, due to the high cost of labor required to lay and maintain them, and are typically only kept for historical or aesthetic reasons. In some countries, however, they are still common in local streets. In the Netherlands, brick paving has made something of a comeback since the adoption of a major nationwide traffic safety program in 1997. From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000 km of city streets were converted to local access roads with a speed limit of 30 km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming. One popular measure is to use brick paving - the noise and vibration slows motorists down. At the same time, it is not uncommon for cycle paths alongside a road to have a smoother surface than the road itself.

Although rarely constructed today, early-style macadam and tarmac pavements are sometimes found beneath modern asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete pavements, because the cost of their removal at the time of renovation would not significantly benefit the durabilty and longevity of the newer surface.

There are ways to create the appearance of brick pavement, without the expense of actual bricks. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar method is to use rubber imprinting tools to press over a thin layer of cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.

==Acoustical implications==
Roadway surfacing choices are known to affect the intensity and spectrum of sound emanating from the tire/surface interaction. Initial applications of noise studies occurred in the early 1970s. Noise phenomena are highly influenced by vehicle speed.

Roadway surface types contribute differential noise effects of up to 4 dB, with chip seal type and grooved roads being the loudest, and concrete surfaces without spacers being the quietest. Asphaltic surfaces perform intermediately relative to concrete and chip seal. Rubberized asphalt has been shown to give a 3–5 dB reduction in tire-pavement noise emissions, and a marginally discernible 1–3 dB reduction in total road noise emissions when compared to conventional asphalt applications.

==Surface deterioration==

As pavement systems primarily fail due to fatigue (in a manner similar to metals), the damage done to pavement increases with the fourth power of the axle load of the vehicles traveling on it. According to the AASHO Road Test, heavily loaded trucks can do more than 10,000 times the damage done by a normal passenger car. Tax rates for trucks are higher than those for cars in most countries for this reason, though they are not levied in proportion to the damage done. Passenger cars are considered to have little practical effect on a pavement&#x27;s service life, from a materials fatigue perspective.

Other failure modes include aging and surface abrasion. As years go by, the binder in a bituminous wearing course gets stiffer and less flexible. When it gets &quot;old&quot; enough, the surface will start losing aggregates, and macrotexture depth increases dramatically. If no maintenance action is done quickly on the wearing course, potholes will form. The freeze-thaw cycle in cold climates will dramatically accelerate pavement deterioration, once water can penetrate the surface. Clay and fumed silica nanoparticles may potentially be used as efficient UV-anti aging coatings in asphalt pavements.

If the road is still structurally sound, a bituminous surface treatment, such as a chipseal or surface dressing can prolong the life of the road at low cost. In areas with cold climate, studded tires may be allowed on passenger cars. In Sweden and Finland, studded passenger car tires account for a very large share of pavement rutting.

The physical properties of a stretch of pavement can be tested using a falling weight deflectometer.

Several design methods have been developed to determine the thickness and composition of road surfaces required to carry predicted traffic loads for a given period of time. Pavement design methods are continuously evolving. Among these are the Shell Pavement design method, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 1993/98 &quot;Guide for Design of Pavement Structures&quot;. A mechanistic-empirical design guide was developed through the NCHRP process, resulting in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG), which was adopted by AASHTO in 2008, although MEPDG implementation by state departments of transportation has been slow.

Further research by University College London into pavements has led to the development of an indoor, 80-sq-metre artificial pavement at a research centre called Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory (PAMELA). It is used to simulate everyday scenarios, from different pavement users to varying pavement conditions. There also exists a research facility near Auburn University, the NCAT Pavement Test Track, that is used to test experimental asphalt pavements for durability.

In addition to repair costs, the condition of a road surface has economic effects for road users. Rolling resistance increases on rough pavement, as does wear and tear of vehicle components. It has been estimated that poor road surfaces cost the average US driver $324 per year in vehicle repairs, or a total of $67 billion. Also, it has been estimated that small improvements in road surface conditions can decrease fuel consumption between 1.8 and 4.7%.

==Markings==

Road surface markings are used on paved roadways to provide guidance and information to drivers and pedestrians. It can be in the form of mechanical markers such as cat&#x27;s eyes, botts&#x27; dots and rumble strips, or non-mechanical markers such as paints, thermoplastic, plastic and epoxy.

<text>Donald James Yarmy (April 13, 1923 – September 25, 2005), known professionally as Don Adams, was an American actor. In his five decades on television, he was best known as bumbling Maxwell Smart (Secret Agent 86) in the television situation comedy &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1965–1970, 1995), which he also sometimes directed and wrote. Adams won three consecutive Emmy Awards for his performance in the series (1967–1969). Adams also provided voices for the animated series &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; (1963–1966) and &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (1983–1986) as well as several revivals and spinoffs of the latter in the 1990s.

==Early life==
Adams was born Donald James Yarmy on April 13, 1923, in Manhattan, New York, a son of William Yarmy and his wife, Consuelo (née Deiter) Yarmy. His father was of Hungarian Jewish descent and his mother was Irish American. Donald and his brother Dick Yarmy were each raised in the religion of one parent: Don in the Catholic faith of their mother, and Dick in the Jewish faith of their father. The brothers had an elder sister, Gloria Ella Yarmy (later Gloria Burton), a writer who wrote an episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;. Dropping out of New York City&#x27;s DeWitt Clinton High School, he worked as a theater usher. He later remarked that he had &quot;little use for school&quot;.

=== World War II service ===
Late in 1941, he joined the United States Marine Corps. Yarmy reported to the First Training Battalion in New River, North Carolina, and then was assigned to I Company of the Third Battalion, Eighth Marines in San Diego.

In May 1942, Yarmy&#x27;s unit was transported to Samoa for further training, and then participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal in August 1942 in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Contrary to urban legend, he was not wounded in combat, but did contract blackwater fever, a serious complication of malaria, known for a 90% rate of fatality. Yarmy was evacuated and then hospitalized for more than a year at a Navy hospital in Wellington, New Zealand. After his recovery, Yarmy served as a Marine Drill Instructor in the United States, holding the rank of corporal. He was an expert marksman and was noted for his competence.

==Career==
===Early career===
After his discharge in 1945, Yarmy went to Florida and worked as a comic in a strip club, doing impersonations of celebrities, but he refused to do &quot;blue&quot; material and was fired. In 1947, he married Adelaide Constance Efantis (1924–2016), nicknamed &quot;Dell&quot;, a singer who performed as Adelaide Adams. He decided to take her name because performers were called up for auditions in alphabetical order. Adams also worked as a commercial artist and restaurant cashier to help support his wife and three daughters.

Adams&#x27; work on television began in 1954 when he won on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; with a stand-up comedy act written by boyhood friend Bill Dana. In the late 1950s, he made eleven appearances on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, where Dana was part of the writing team. During the 1961–63 television seasons, he was a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; as part of The Kraft Music Hall Players, and frequently on the Jimmy Dean Show. He had a role on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot; (1963–65) as a bumbling hotel detective named Byron Glick.

===&quot;Get Smart&quot;===
Creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, prompted by producers Daniel Melnick and David Susskind, wrote &quot;Get Smart&quot; as the comedic answer to the successful 1960s spy television dramas such as &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot; and others. They were asked to write a spoof that combined elements from two of the most popular film series at the time: James Bond and The Pink Panther (Inspector Clouseau).

&quot;Get Smart&quot; was written as a vehicle for Tom Poston, to be piloted on ABC; when ABC turned it down, NBC picked up the show and cast Adams in the role because he was already under contract. When &quot;Get Smart&quot; debuted in 1965, it was an immediate hit. Barbara Feldon co-starred as Max&#x27;s young and attractive partner (later wife) Agent 99. They had great chemistry throughout the show&#x27;s run, despite a 10-year age difference, and they became best friends during and after.

Adams gave the character a clipped speaking style borrowed from actor William Powell. Feldon said, &quot;Part of the pop fervor for Agent 86 was because Don did such an extreme portrayal of the character that it made it easy to imitate.&quot; Adams created many popular catchphrases (some of which were in his act before the show), including &quot;Sorry about that, Chief&quot;, , &quot;Ahh ... the old [noun] in the [noun] trick. That&#x27;s the [number]th time this [month/week].&quot; (sometimes the description of the trick was simply, &quot;Ahh... the old [noun] trick.&quot;), and &quot;Missed it by &#x27;that much&#x27;&quot;.

Adams also produced and directed 13 episodes of the show. He was nominated for Emmys four seasons in a row, from 1966 to 1969, for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series. He won the award three times. The show moved to CBS for its final season, with ratings declining, as spy series went out of fashion. &quot;Get Smart&quot; was canceled in 1970 after 138 episodes.

===Typecasting===
Following this, Adams then wanted to move on to other projects. His efforts after &quot;Get Smart&quot; were less successful, including the comedy series &quot;The Partners&quot; (1971–72), a game show called &quot;Don Adams&#x27; Screen Test&quot; (1975–76, see below), and three attempts to revive the &quot;Get Smart&quot; series in the 1980s. His movie &quot;The Nude Bomb&quot; (1980) was unsuccessful at the box office. Adams had been typecast as Maxwell Smart and was unable to escape the image, although he had success as the voice of the title character of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;.

He earned most of his income from his work on stage and in nightclubs. As Adams had chosen a lower salary in exchange for a one-third ownership stake in &quot;Get Smart&quot; during the show&#x27;s production, he received a regular income for many years due to the show&#x27;s popularity in reruns.

===&quot;Don Adams&#x27; Screen Test&quot;===

&quot;Don Adams&#x27; Screen Test&quot; was a syndicated game show which lasted 26 episodes during the 1975–76 season. The show was filmed in two 15-minute segments, in each of which a randomly selected audience member would &quot;act&quot; to re-create a scene from a Hollywood movie as accurately as possible.

Such moments as the bar scene from &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, the duel scene from &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; or the beach scene from &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; were used, with Adams directing and a celebrity guest playing the other lead in the scene. Hokey effects, bad timing, forgotten lines, prop failures and the celebrity&#x27;s &quot;ad libs&quot; were maximized for comic effect as the audience watched &quot;bloopers&quot; and &quot;outtakes&quot; as they happened. At the end of the program, the final, serious, fully edited version of the &quot;screen test&quot; of each of the two contestants would be played, with audience reaction determining the winner, who would receive a trip to Hollywood and a real screen test for a motion picture.

===Later work===

Adams resurrected the Maxwell Smart character for a series of television commercials for Savemart, a retail chain that sold audio and video equipment. He also did a series of audio/radio commercials in the 1980s for Chief Auto Parts, a retail automobile parts establishment later sold to AutoZone.

He also appeared in the film &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1982) and played a cameo role as a harbormaster in &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987).

Adams attempted a situation-comedy comeback in Canada with &quot;Check it Out!&quot; in 1985. Set in a supermarket, the show ran for three years but was not successful in the United States. The show also starred Gordon Clapp, an unknown actor at the time, who developed a rapport with Adams.

In 1995, Adams reprised his Maxwell Smart role one last time on &quot;Get Smart&quot; for Fox; it co-starred Barbara Feldon and rising star Andy Dick as Max and 99&#x27;s son. Unlike the original version, this show did not appeal to younger viewers, and it was canceled after just seven episodes. One of Adams&#x27;s last public appearances was at the Get Smart Gathering on November 7, 2003, at a North Hollywood restaurant, in which fans of the show joined the cast and some of the creative talent of the series.

Adams was the voice of the title character in &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; (1963–66), with his bombastic catchphrase &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo will &quot;not&quot; fail!&quot; Later, he voiced himself in animated form for a guest shot in an episode of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, titled &quot;The Exterminator&quot;. His most notable voiceover work was that of the title character in &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. He voiced the character in the original television series (1983–85) and a 1992 Christmas special, as well as in subsequent 1990s spinoffs &quot;Gadget Boy&quot; and &quot;Inspector Gadget&#x27;s Field Trip&quot;. He retired from voicing Inspector Gadget in 1999.

His last roles were the character of Principal Hickey in the late-1990s/early-2000s Disney cartoon &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; and the voice of Brain the Dog in the end credits for the 1999 film version of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;.

==Personal life==
At the time of his enlistment in the U.S. Marines, he listed &quot;none&quot; on the section of the form asking about religion. During his difficult recovery from blackwater fever, he returned to his Catholic faith as he prayed to survive.

Adams divorced Adelaide in 1960 and married Dorothy Bracken, an actress. He left Bracken in 1977 to marry actress Judy Luciano with whom he had one child. That marriage also ended in divorce. He had seven children: Carolyn, Christine, Cathy, Cecily, Stacey, Sean, and Beige. Cecily died of lung cancer in 2004 and his son Sean died in 2006 at age 35 of a brain tumor, a year after Don Adams&#x27;s death.

His brother Richard Paul Yarmy, also known as Dick Yarmy (February 14, 1932 – May 5, 1992), was an actor. His sister Gloria Yarmy Burton was a writer. Robert Karvelas, who played the role of Agent Larabee on &quot;Get Smart&quot;, was Adams&#x27; cousin on his mother&#x27;s side of the family.

A compulsive gambler, according to his longtime friend Bill Dana, Adams &quot;could be very devoted to his family if you reminded him about it, [but] Don&#x27;s whole life was focused around gambling.&quot;

==Death==
Adams died on September 25, 2005, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He suffered from lymphoma and a lung infection. His health had declined after the death of his daughter Cecily. Before his death, Adams had joked about not wanting a mournful funeral, preferring, he said, to have his friends get together &quot;and bring me back to life.&quot;

Among his eulogists were his decades-long friends Barbara Feldon; Don Rickles; James Caan; Bill Dana; and his son-in-law, actor Jim Beaver (widower of Adams&#x27; daughter Cecily). His funeral Mass was held at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. He is interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

<doc id="241391" wikidata="Q922445" url="?curid=241391" title="Pavement (band)">
<text>Pavement is an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California, in 1989. For most of their career, the group consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums), and Bob Nastanovich (percussion, synthesizers and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and ten EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, followed by another international tour from 2022 to 2024.

Though only briefly attracting mainstream attention with the single &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot; in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career, including Flying Nun and Matador. They have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the 1990s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called them the best band of the 1990s. They have achieved a cult following.

==History==
=== 1987–1992: Formation and &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; ===
Pavement officially formed in Stockton, California, in January 1989 as a studio project of guitarists and vocalists Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, known originally only as &quot;S.M.&quot; and &quot;Spiral Stairs&quot;. Kannberg had previously started a band of the same name and played one show in 1987 before quickly disbanding. Their debut EPs were the lo-fi releases &quot;Slay Tracks: 1933–1969&quot;, &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Sound Forever&quot;. They were recorded at Louder Than You Think, the home studio of Stockton local and former hippie Gary Young who also played drums on the recordings. Upon first hearing the duo&#x27;s songs, Young was quoted as saying, &quot;this Malkmus idiot is a complete songwriting genius&quot;.

During this time the band was often compared to English rock band the Fall. Kannberg stated in a 1992 interview that he preferred Minneapolis rock band the Replacements. The Fall singer Mark E. Smith claimed that Pavement were a &quot;rip-off&quot; and that they did not &quot;have an original idea in their heads&quot;; other members of the Fall have been more positive.

After the release of &quot;Slay Tracks&quot;, a new drummer, Jason Turner, was drafted to replace Young. However, after just one tour and a handful of recording sessions, when it became apparent that Turner and Malkmus did not get along, Young was reinstated. Malkmus later described Turner as &quot;this depressed guy who might assassinate me one day... He&#x27;s very competitive.&quot; Around the same time, Bob Nastanovich was incorporated into the live Pavement band as an auxiliary percussionist. Malkmus had been roommates with Nastanovich in New York City.

Pavement&#x27;s first performance was on December 14, 1989, on their local college radio station KDVS-FM in Davis, with Malkmus, Kannberg, and Turner. In 1990, Pavement embarked on their first tour, with a third guitarist, Rob Chamberlin, who left to join a band called Sugartime before Ibold joined the group.

British indie rock band the Wedding Present covered the &quot;Slay Tracks&quot; song &quot;Box Elder&quot; after their bassist discovered the album during a trip to the United States. As Pavement were still unknown at the time, people erroneously grew to believe that Pavement&#x27;s original recording was the cover. The Wedding Present frontman David Gedge gave a Pavement EP to John Peel, who quickly became one of Pavement&#x27;s biggest fans.

Around 1992, Pavement became a full-time band, with Malkmus, Kannberg, Young, Nastanovich, and bassist Mark Ibold, who had been one of the band&#x27;s earliest fans. They played their first show at punk club The Court Tavern in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Their debut album, &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot;, was released commercially in 1992 after copies had been circulated on cassette tape for nearly a year. Though the percussive influence of the Fall was still pervasive, as was that of English post-punk band Swell Maps, many of the songs also exhibited a strong sense of melody. Since its release &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; has appeared on many critics&#x27; best-of lists and is frequently cited as being among the most influential indie rock albums of the 1990s. It is listed on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Later the same year, the band released the EP &quot;Watery, Domestic&quot;.

=== 1993–1994: &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; ===
During the &quot;Slanted &amp; Enchanted&quot; tour, Gary Young&#x27;s behavior became more eccentric; he would hand out cabbage and mashed potatoes to fans at the door of the venue, perform handstands, drunkenly fall off his drum stool, and run around the venue while the band was playing. The band only understood how severe Young&#x27;s drinking problem was after Pavement&#x27;s first few tours. Malkmus later told &quot;Tape Op&quot;, &quot;We knew that he was like a hippie and kinda flaky, but we didn&#x27;t know he had such a bad drinking problem. We found out on that tour, because he really got sick from being nervous... That&#x27;s why I let Bob be in the band...&#x27;Keep the beat going if Gary passes out.&#x27;&quot; In 1993, Malkmus unsuccessfully attempted to record some songs at Young&#x27;s studio. He later said, &quot;We kind of wanted to not record with him anymore, but we were too nice to fire people or even really talk about it... We tried to record there, but it wasn&#x27;t sounding good and he didn&#x27;t have his studio ready and he was also in a drinking funk.&quot;

At the conclusion of a 1993 tour of Australia, Japan, and Europe, the group held a meeting in a hotel room in Copenhagen. Malkmus, Kannberg, and Ibold remained silent while Nastanovich, Young&#x27;s best friend at the time, argued with Young. Young agreed to leave the band. He was replaced by Steve West, who had been a fellow museum security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art along with Malkmus and David Berman. West&#x27;s debut performance was in 1993 at a Drag City festival in Chicago. Also that year, the band contributed to the AIDS-Benefit Album &quot;No Alternative&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization with their song &quot;Unseen Power of the Picket Fence&quot;.

Pavement&#x27;s second album &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; was released in 1994. The record was more indebted to the classic rock tradition than their debut. The single &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot; was the most successful song, and briefly enjoyed airplay on alternative rock radio and MTV. Pavement performed the song on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Additionally, the video aired on &quot;Career Day&quot;, a season five episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;, who termed it &quot;buttwipe music&quot; and also wanted the band to &quot;try harder.&quot; The song was also featured briefly in the movie &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot;. Like its predecessor, the album received widespread acclaim, including being listed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

The lyrics from another single from the album, &quot;Range Life&quot;, criticized alternative rock stars the Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots. Malkmus has insisted over the years that the line is meant to be light-hearted and is sung from the point of view of the aging hippie character in the song. Later live versions of the track had Malkmus substituting &quot;the Spice Girls&quot;, &quot;Counting Crows&quot;, or others for &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;. In response, Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan threatened to drop his band from their slot headlining the 1994 Lollapalooza Festival if Pavement was allowed to play. Corgan and Malkmus traded barbs in the press for several years afterwards.

=== 1995–1997: &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; and &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; ===
The next album, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot;, recorded in Memphis and released April 11, 1995, covered a wide range of styles including punk, country and balladry across its 18 tracks, which often avoided conventional song structures. On the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD, Malkmus attributed his odd choice of singles to his marijuana smoking, stating that &quot;I was smoking a lot of grass back then but to me they sounded like hits.&quot; Although Malkmus has said in recent interviews that the album is the last &quot;classic Pavement record&quot;, Kannberg has voiced regrets about &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot;. &quot;We made some mistakes on that record... we were kind of pressured into putting out a record a little faster than we were ready to. I mean, I&#x27;m totally into the record. It&#x27;s just if we had another six months to think about it, it would&#x27;ve been much different.&quot;

During the tour for the album, Nastanovich stated on the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD, the band would often not work out a setlist before shows, opting for drug and alcohol fueled jams over hit singles. Some of these shows were held during the 1995 Lollapallooza festival, where the incoherent performances received a hostile reaction from many audiences. Footage from &quot;Slow Century&quot; shows the band being pelted with mud and rocks. The band left the stage immediately and dubbed themselves &quot;The Band That Ruined Lollapallooza&quot;.

&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; was followed up by the EP &quot;Pacific Trim&quot;, which was recorded with only Malkmus and drummers Nastanovich and Steve West. Their studio time was originally reserved for a Silver Jews recording, but frontman David Berman walked out in frustration and the trio decided not to waste prepaid recording time.

&quot;Brighten the Corners&quot;, released in 1997 and produced by Mitch Easter, was a shorter, more conventional record than &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot;. Malkmus said on the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD that the album was an attempt to show audiences that Pavement had more mainstream and classic rock influences than it had previously portrayed. The album contained two of the band&#x27;s best known singles in &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Shady Lane&quot;. It was the only Pavement album to include a lyric sheet except &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; and sold better than its predecessors. Despite increased success, the band continued to fragment, with its members focusing more on other musical projects or on raising families.

=== 1998–2000: &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; and breakup ===
In 1998, Pavement began work on their final album, &quot;Terror Twilight&quot;. The band originally planned to self-produce &quot;Terror Twilight&quot;, renting out Jackpot! Studios in Portland, Oregon. The group stalled though, with Malkmus, Ibold, Nastanovich, and Jackpot! employee and future Jicks bassist Joanna Bolme usually opting to play Scrabble over getting any sort of work accomplished. Kannberg was especially frustrated over the sessions, particularly at Malkmus&#x27;s refusal to include any of Kannberg&#x27;s songs on the album. Fan favorite &quot;For Sale: The Preston School of Industry&quot; and one other song penned by Kannberg were briefly worked on during the sessions, but abandoned.

Nigel Godrich, known for his work with Radiohead and Beck, was hired to produce. He wanted to make an album that &quot;stood up straighter&quot; and would &quot;reach people who were turned off by the beautiful sloppiness of other Pavement records&quot;. The group began work in Sonic Youth&#x27;s studio in lower Manhattan, New York. Godrich found the studio limiting, so they moved to RPM Studios near Washington Square Park. According to Nastanovich, Godrich struggled with the band&#x27;s casual approach, and called for more takes than they were used to. Though Nastanovich said Godrich took on a &quot;substantial challenge&quot; and &quot;did a good job&quot;, he felt he only connected with Malkmus and disregarded the other band members; Nastanovich realized after several days that Godrich did not know his name. Kannberg was unhappy that Malkmus was not interested in working on songs Kannberg had written, and said it was the hardest Pavement record to make.

Pavement released one last EP, &quot;Major Leagues&quot;. It features three Malkmus songs, two original Spiral Stairs songs and two covers, &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and &quot;The Classical&quot; by the Fall. Pavement embarked on a six-month world tour for &quot;Terror Twilight&quot;, during which time relationships within the group frayed, especially between Malkmus and the other members. After their show at the 1999 Coachella Festival, Malkmus told his bandmates he did not want to continue. During the final concert of the tour, at Brixton Academy in London on November 20, 1999, Malkmus had a pair of handcuffs attached to his microphone stand and told the audience: &quot;These symbolize what it&#x27;s like being in a band all these years.&quot; About two weeks later, a spokesperson for their record label told &quot;NME&quot; that Pavement had &quot;retired for the foreseeable future&quot;.

In mid-2000, Malkmus called Kannberg and told him, &quot;You need to change the website to say we aren&#x27;t a band any more. People keep asking me if we&#x27;re breaking up and you know we&#x27;re not a band any more, right?&quot; Kannberg told Malkmus that he needed to call the other members of the band to inform them that the band was finally breaking up, but Malkmus refused and Kannberg was left with the task of informing them. West said he had never received any call about the breakup from anyone in the band, and discovered that Pavement had dissolved via the internet. Nastanovich later said &quot;there was too much exhaustion for heavy emotion&quot;.

=== 2010: First reunion and second hiatus ===

On September 15, 2009, Brooklyn Vegan reported that Pavement were scheduled to perform multiple benefit show dates in New York City&#x27;s Central Park from September 21, 2010. Official statements by the band, label, venue and promoter were released on September 17, 2009, confirming the reunion. The announcement included one concert in Central Park and the promise of a tour, but said that the reunion may only be a one-off event. It said, &quot;Please be advised this tour is not a prelude to additional jaunts and/or a permanent reunion.&quot; Tickets for the first Central Park concert sold out in two minutes, leading to the announcement of three more shows at the same venue. The band later confirmed a world-wide tour which started in Auckland, New Zealand, on March 1 at the Auckland Town Hall, before heading on to Australia then heading to the UK, including the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Minehead, Somerset (May 14–16) and several European shows. They also performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2010, the Sasquatch! and Primavera Sound Festivals in May, the Toronto Island Concert in June with Broken Social Scene, Band Of Horses, and others, Open&#x27;er Festival, Roskilde Festival and Les Ardentes and Pitchfork Music Festival in July.

The band released a &quot;best-of&quot; compilation album in March 2010, entitled &quot;Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pavement&quot;. On June 24, 2010, Pavement performed at the Bob Hope Theatre in Stockton, their first-ever hometown show. Original drummer Gary Young joined the band for an encore, playing three songs from &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot;. Young also joined the band during six songs the next night at The Greek Theater in Berkeley.

In September 2010, Pavement appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. After concluding their proper US tour at the Hollywood Bowl on September 30, the band played the following night in Las Vegas at the Palms Casino as a part of the Matador At 21 festival. During their set, Scott Kannberg kicked his monitor and smashed his guitar into his amp in frustration of not being able to hear himself while performing. &quot;NME&quot; noted the band had an &quot;icy atmosphere onstage&quot;. The band honored a further two South American show commitments in November 2010.

Kannberg joined Malkmus and the Jicks onstage at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles on March 28, 2014, for an encore performance of the Pavement song &quot;Stereo&quot;. On October 1 and 2, 2016, Malkmus and the Jicks performed at Spiral Stairs&#x27; 50th birthday celebration at the Chapel in San Francisco. On the first night, Kannberg joined Malkmus and the Jicks for four songs. The following night, Kannberg played three more songs with the group, joined by Gary Young on the final two.

=== 2022–2024: Second reunion ===
On June 1, 2019, Pavement announced that they would reunite to perform two 30th-anniversary shows at the 2020 Primavera Sound festivals in Barcelona and Porto. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was rescheduled for June 2021. In March 2021, the festival was delayed to 2022. In September 2021, Pavement announced a European tour for late 2022, their first in 12 years, and announced a North American leg on November 2, 2021. On May 23, 2022, the band played their first show since 2010 for a sold-out crowd at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles. In June, the band at last performed at Primavera Sound 2022 in Barcelona and Porto, respectively.

For the tour, Pavement were joined by the keyboardist and backing vocalist Rebecca Cole, a former member of the Minders and Wild Flag. Nastanovich said Cole gave them more versatility and allowed them to play songs they had not performed live before.

As a prelude to their tour, Pavement worked with the bakery Rudy&#x27;s Strudel and the Current Year Records and Tapes in Parma, Ohio, to come up with five flavors of pierogi based on their albums. Nastanovich and the Current Year&#x27;s Michael Stutz played records at a benefit show for Parma seniors to raise thousands for charity, put together by the Parma for Pavement International Committee. Pavement did not rule out playing new songs live, but Malkmus said it would be &quot;total cringe&quot; to record new music.

The band began their North American tour at the Balboa Theater on September 7, 2022, followed by concerts across 12 US states and Canada, ending at Austin City Limits, Texas on October 11. On October 17, the band began their European tour at the O2 Academy Leeds, England, which included touring the countries of England, Scotland, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Ireland. The final European tour date took place at Vicar Street in Dublin, Ireland, on November 11.

The band then toured Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2023. While in Australia, the band appeared at the Mona Foma festival in Hobart alongside Bikini Kill, Angel Olsen and Jockstrap. The band then scheduled additional shows in Salt Lake City, Reykjavík, and Galway. That summer, the band was referenced in the film &quot;Barbie&quot;. Original drummer Gary Young died on August 17, 2023, at the age of 70. A documentary on Young&#x27;s life, &quot;Louder Than You Think&quot;, had premiered earlier that year at SXSW.

The band performed their final show of the year at Smale Park in Cincinnati at the National&#x27;s Homecoming festival on September 16, 2023. Kannberg and Malkmus hinted that it would be the band&#x27;s last show for a while, but the band then announced a new performance at São Paulo&#x27;s C6 Festival on May 19, 2024. In conjunction with the New York Film Festival premier of &quot;Pavements&quot;, a film about the band, Pavement played a one-off show on October 1, 2024 at New York City&#x27;s Sony Hall, which Nastanovich said would be the band&#x27;s &quot;last show for a long time&quot;.

Malkmus&#x27; new supergroup, The Hard Quartet, released their self-titled debut album on October 4, 2024. While promoting the release, Malkmus noted that he would be open to recording a sixth Pavement album: &quot;It did creep into my mind that actually, [an album] could be a possibility, but really, we just never got around to it [on the 2022-2024 reunion tour]. There&#x27;s a classic reason too, that we&#x27;d want to get it right - like period-correct, those feelings. That being said, I&#x27;m not averse to it. You go around the world for a year and a half with these really nice guys that are your friends, and everyone was jacked about the whole thing.&quot; In December 2024, Scott Kannberg revealed that a new Pavement song will appear on the soundtrack album to &quot;&quot;Pavements&quot;&quot;, marking their first new material in over twenty-five years.

== Musical style and influences==
Categorized as an indie rock band, Pavement were known for their &quot;fractured&quot; song structures and lo-fidelity production values. Heather Phares of AllMusic said, &quot;Standing detached from the tumult of grunge, Pavement seemed laconic, sometimes lazy, as they threaded their love of underground American rock and British post-punk, dressing their winding melodies with squalls of feedback and shambolic rhythms.&quot; Pavement is credited for defining the modern &quot;indie rock&quot; sound and was a large presence in 1990s &quot;slacker culture&quot;. Malkmus&#x27; humorous and often cryptic lyrical themes were a key factor in gaining their cult following. Malkmus rarely wrote ballads or love songs and only a small portion of their discography contained personal reflections or similar lyrical themes, and most were satirical or laced with sarcasm. Malkmus&#x27;s vocal style in his work with Pavement was characterized as &quot;half-sung, half-spoken&quot;.

Pavement was noted for their heavy use of heavy guitar distortion, and for having no designated rhythm and lead guitar player. Malkmus and Kannberg switched roles frequently although Malkmus played lead for the majority of their career. The band was also noted for their use of a foil, or a &#x27;hype-man&#x27; usually present in hip hop groups. Bob Nastanovich filled the role although he has detested the term himself. Nastanovich also served as a second drummer during their live performances and served as lead vocalist on select songs that required screaming to prevent strain on Malkmus&#x27; voice.

Early in their career, Pavement were influenced by the Fall. Influences cited by Kannberg include the Replacements and Swell Maps.

The band has also listed Sonic Youth, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and R.E.M. as direct influences. Pavement referenced R.E.M. in the song &quot;Unseen Power of The Picket Fence&quot; featured on the compilation &quot;No Alternative&quot; and covered &quot;Camera&quot; which appeared as a B-side on the single of &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot;. They have also covered Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; on the &quot;Major Leagues&quot; EP.

== Other media ==
In 2002, &quot;Slow Century&quot;, a documentary by Lance Bangs coupled with all of the band&#x27;s music videos, was released as a 2 DVD set. Included was extensive footage, both professionally shot and taped by fans on camcorders, from the band&#x27;s earliest shows in 1989 forward. The three final songs from the band&#x27;s final concert (&quot;Stop Breathin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Conduit for Sale&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;) are presented at the end of the documentary. Also on the DVD is a hidden easter egg clip from the same show, wherein Malkmus talks about how the handcuffs attached to his microphone stand &quot;represent what it&#x27;s like being in a band all these years.&quot; A bonus disc with a complete concert in Seattle, Washington, from the early part of the &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; tour was included on the second disc, as well as several songs from their penultimate show.

2004 saw the publication of &quot;Perfect Sound Forever: The Story of Pavement&quot;, a biography on the band written by Rob Jovanovic. Reviews for the book were mixed, with some saying that it contained much of the same information as the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD and expanded very little on it, while others called it a &quot;fond retrospection&quot;.

&quot;Slanted! Enchanted! A Pavement Musical&quot;, a play consisting of songs from the Pavement discography and following a Stephen Malkmus–like protagonist, opened with a limited run off-broadway in December 2022.

<text>The cosmological model of concentric (or homocentric) spheres, developed by Eudoxus, Callippus, and Aristotle, employed celestial spheres all centered on the Earth. In this respect, it differed from the epicyclic and eccentric models with multiple centers, which were used by Ptolemy and other mathematical astronomers until the time of Copernicus.

==Origins of the concept of concentric spheres==

Eudoxus of Cnidus was the first astronomer to develop the concept of concentric spheres. He was originally a student at Plato&#x27;s academy and is believed to have been influenced by the cosmological speculations of Plato and Pythagoras. He came up with the idea of homocentric spheres in order to explain the perceived inconsistent motions of the planets and to develop a uniform model for accurately calculating the movement of celestial objects. None of his books have survived to the modern day and everything we know about his cosmological theories comes from the works of Aristotle and Simplicius. According to these works, Eudoxus’ model had twenty-seven homocentric spheres with each sphere explaining a type of observable motion for each celestial object. Eudoxus assigns one sphere for the fixed stars which is supposed to explain their daily movement. He assigns three spheres to both the sun and the moon with the first sphere moving in the same manner as the sphere of the fixed stars. The second sphere explains the movement of the sun and the moon on the ecliptic plane. The third sphere was supposed to move on a “latitudinally inclined” circle and explain the latitudinal motion of the sun and the moon in the cosmos. Four spheres were assigned to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn which were the only known planets at that time. The first and second spheres of the planets moved exactly like the first two spheres of the sun and the moon. According to Simplicius, the third and fourth sphere of the planets were supposed to move in a way that created a curve known as a hippopede. The hippopede was a way to try and explain the retrograde motions of planets. Many historians of science, such as Michael J. Crowe, have argued that Eudoxus did not consider his system of concentric spheres to be a real representation of the universe but thought it was merely a mathematical model for calculating planetary motion.

==Later additions to Eudoxus&#x27; model==

Callippus, a contemporary of Eudoxus, attempted to improve his system by increasing the total number of homocentric spheres. He added two additional spheres for the sun and the moon as well as one additional sphere for Mars, Mercury, and Venus. These additional spheres were supposed to fix some of the calculation problems in Eudoxus’ original system. Callippus’ system was able to better predict the motions of certain celestial objects but his system still had many problems and was not able to account for many astronomical observations.

Aristotle developed his own system of concentric spheres in &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and &quot;De Caelo&quot; (On the Heavens). He thought that both Eudoxus and Callippus had too few spheres within their models and added more spheres onto Callippus’ system. He added three spheres to Jupiter and Mars as well as four spheres to Venus, Mercury, the sun, and the moon for a total of fifty-five spheres. He later doubted the accuracy of his results and stated that he believed there were either forty seven or forty nine concentric spheres. Historians are unsure about how many spheres Aristotle thought there were in the cosmos with theories ranging from 43 to 55. Unlike Eudoxus, Aristotle believed that his system represented an actual model of the cosmos.

<text>Palestine, officially the State of Palestine, is a country in the Southern Levant region of West Asia. Recognized by a majority of UN member states, it encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, collectively known as the occupied Palestinian territories, within the broader geographic and historical Palestine region. Palestine shares most of its borders with Israel, and it borders Jordan to the east and Egypt to the southwest. It has a total land area of while its population exceeds five million people. Its proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, while Ramallah serves as its administrative center. Gaza City was its largest city prior to evacuations in 2023.

Situated at a continental crossroad, the region of Palestine was ruled by various empires and experienced various demographic changes from antiquity to the modern era. Being a bridge between Asia and Africa, it was treading ground for the Nile and Mesopotamian armies and merchants from North Africa, China and India. The region is known for its religious significance. The ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict dates back to the rise of the Zionist movement, supported by the United Kingdom during World War I. The war saw Britain occupying Palestine from the Ottoman Empire, where it set up Mandatory Palestine under the auspices of the League of Nations. Increased Jewish immigration led to intercommunal conflict between Jews and Palestinian Arabs, which escalated into a civil war in 1947 after a proposed partitioning by the United Nations was rejected by the Palestinians.

The 1948 Palestine war saw the forcible displacement of most of its predominantly Arab population, and consequently the establishment of Israel, in what Palestinians call the Nakba (&quot;catastrophe&quot;). In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which had been held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared independence in 1988. In 1993, the PLO signed the Oslo Accords with Israel, creating limited PLO governance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip through the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel withdrew from Gaza in its unilateral disengagement in 2005, but the territory is still considered to be under military occupation and has been blockaded by Israel. In 2007, internal divisions between political factions led to a takeover of Gaza by Hamas. Since then, the West Bank has been governed in part by the Fatah-led PA, while the Gaza Strip has remained under the control of Hamas. Israel has constructed large settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967, which currently house more than 670,000 Israeli settlers, which are illegal under international law. Attacks by Hamas-led armed groups in October 2023 in Israel were followed by the Gaza war, which has caused widespread destruction and a humanitarian crisis throughout the Gaza Strip, including the displacement of nearly all of its population. The United Nations special committee and a number of experts and rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people during its ongoing invasion and bombing of the Gaza Strip.

Some of the challenges to Palestine include ineffective government, Israeli occupation, a blockade, restrictions on movement, Israeli settlements and settler violence, as well as an overall poor security situation. The questions of Palestine&#x27;s borders, the legal and diplomatic status of Jerusalem, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees remain unsolved. Despite these challenges, the country maintains an emerging economy and sees frequent tourism. Arabic is the official language of the country. While the majority of Palestinians practice Islam, Christianity also has a presence. Palestine is also a member of several international organizations, including the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. 

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;Palestine&quot; (in Latin, &quot;Palæstina&quot;) comes via ancient Greek from a Semitic toponym for the general area dating back to the late second millennium BCE, a reflex of which is also to be found in the Biblical ethnonym Philistines. The term &quot;Palestine&quot; has been used to refer to the area at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea beside Syria. In the 5th century BCE, in his work &quot;The Histories&quot; Herodotus used the term to describe a &quot;district of Syria, called Palaistine&quot; in which Phoenicians interacted with other maritime peoples.

=== Terminology ===
This article uses the terms &quot;Palestine&quot;, &quot;State of Palestine&quot;, &quot;occupied Palestinian territory (oPt or OPT)&quot; interchangeably depending on context. Specifically, the term &quot;occupied Palestinian territory&quot; refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Palestine can, depending on contexts, be referred to as a country or a state, and its authorities can generally be identified as the Government of Palestine.

== History ==

=== From prehistory to the Ottoman era ===
=== Rise of Palestinian nationalism ===
Though Palestinian elites, in particular urban notable families who worked within the Ottoman bureaucracy, generally retained their loyalty to the Ottomans, they also played a significant role proportionately in the rise of Arab nationalism, and the Pan-Arabic movements that arose in response to both the emergence of the Young Turks movement and the subsequent weakening of Ottoman power in World War 1. The onset of the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, also exercised a strong influence on Palestinian national consciousness. Abdul Hamid, the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, opposed the Zionist movement&#x27;s efforts in Palestine. The end of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s rule in Palestine coincided with the conclusion of World War I. The failure of Emir Faisal to establish a Greater Syria in the face of French and British colonial claims to the area, also shaped Palestinian elites&#x27; efforts to secure local autonomy. In the aftermath of the war Palestine came under British control with the implementation of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1920.

=== British Mandate ===
The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule. In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration. In 1917, Jerusalem was captured by British forces led by General Allenby, marking the end of Ottoman rule in the city. By 1920, tensions escalated between Jewish and Arab communities, resulting in violent clashes and riots across Palestine. The League of Nations approved the British Mandate for Palestine in 1922, entrusting Britain with the administration of the region. Throughout the 1920s, Palestine experienced growing resistance from both Jewish and Arab nationalist movements, which manifested in sporadic violence and protests against British policies. In 1929, violent riots erupted in Palestine due to disputes over Jewish immigration and access to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The 1930s witnessed the outbreak of the Arab Revolt, as Arab nationalists demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the establishment of an independent Arab state. In response to the Arab Revolt, the British deployed military forces and implemented stringent security measures in an effort to quell the uprising.

Arab nationalist groups, led by the Arab Higher Committee, called for an end to Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews. The issuance of the 1939 White Paper by the British government aimed to address escalating tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. This policy document imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases, with the intention to limit the establishment of a Jewish state. Met with strong opposition from the Zionist movement, the White Paper was perceived as a betrayal of the Balfour Declaration and Zionist aspirations for a Jewish homeland. In response to the White Paper, the Zionist community in Palestine organized a strike in 1939, rallying against the restrictions on Jewish immigration and land acquisition. This anti-White Paper strike involved demonstrations, civil disobedience, and a shutdown of businesses. Supported by various Zionist organizations, including the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut (General Federation of Jewish Labor), the anti-White Paper strike aimed to protest and challenge the limitations imposed by the British government.

In the late 1930s and 1940s, several Zionist militant groups, including the Irgun, Hagana, and Lehi, carried out acts of violence against British military and civilian targets in their pursuit of an independent Jewish state. While the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, not all Muslims supported his actions, and there were instances where Muslims helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust. In 1946, a bombing orchestrated by the Irgun at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of 91 people, including British officials, civilians, and hotel staff. Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, who later became political leaders in the state of Israel, were behind these terrorist attacks. The Exodus 1947 incident unfolded when a ship carrying Jewish Holocaust survivors, who sought refuge in Palestine, was intercepted by the British navy, leading to clashes and the eventual deportation of the refugees back to Europe. During World War II, Palestine served as a strategically significant location for British military operations against Axis forces in North Africa. In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan for Palestine, suggesting separate Jewish and Arab states, but it was rejected by Arab nations while accepted by Jewish leaders.

=== Arab–Israeli wars ===
In 1947, the UN adopted a partition plan for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the Jewish Agency for Israel, headed by David Ben-Gurion, declared the establishment of the State of Israel according to the proposed UN plan. The Arab Higher Committee did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with Transjordan, Egypt, and the other members of the Arab League of the time, commenced military action resulting in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were designated to be part of the Arab state under the UN plan. Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and Transjordan occupied and then annexed the West Bank. Egypt initially supported the creation of an All-Palestine Government but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form Jordan. The annexation was ratified in 1950 but was rejected by the international community.

In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The Palestinian National Charter of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. The Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, ended with Israel occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, besides other territories. Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but relocated to Lebanon in 1971.

The October 1974 Arab League summit designated the PLO as the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot; and reaffirmed &quot;their right to establish an independent state of urgency&quot;. In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly granting them observer status as a &quot;non-state entity&quot; at the UN. Through the Camp David Accords of 1979, Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan ceded its claims to the West Bank—with the exception of guardianship over Haram al-Sharif—to the PLO.

After Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish Israeli settlements there. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the Israeli Civil Administration of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories and by local municipal councils present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.

=== Uprising, declaration and peace treaty ===
The First Intifada broke out in 1987, characterized by widespread protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank against Israeli occupation. In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the &quot;State of Palestine&quot;. In the month following, it was quickly recognized by many states, including Egypt and Jordan. In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the &quot;Palestinian territory&quot;, without explicitly specifying further. After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknowledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation &quot;Palestine&quot; instead of &quot;Palestine Liberation Organization&quot; in the UN. In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine&#x27;s government. Violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces intensified throughout 1989, resulting in a significant loss of life and escalating tensions in the occupied territories. 1990 witnessed the imposition of strict measures by the Israeli government, including curfews and closures, in an attempt to suppress the Intifada and maintain control over the occupied territories.

The 1990–1991 Gulf War brought increased attention to the conflict, leading to heightened diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution. Saddam Hussein was a supporter of Palestinian cause and won support from Arafat during the war. Following the invasion of Kuwait, Saddam surprised the international community by presenting a peace offer to Israel and withdrawing Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in exchange of withdrawal from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Though the peace offer was rejected, Saddam then ordered firing of scud missiles into Israeli territory. This movement was supported by Palestinians. The war also led to the expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as their government supported Iraq.

In 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and a potential path to peace. Yasser Arafat was elected as president of the newly formed Palestinian Authority in 1994, marking a significant step towards self-governance.

Israel acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as &quot;representing the Palestinian people&quot;, in return for the PLO recognizing Israel&#x27;s right to exist in peace, acceptance of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and its rejection of &quot;violence and terrorism&quot;. As a result, in 1994 the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA) territorial administration, that exercises some governmental functions in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA. It was given civilian control in Area B and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in Area C.

The peace process gained opposition from both Palestinians and Israelis. Islamist militant organizations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposed the attack and responded by conducting attacks on civilians across Israel. In 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli extremist shot 29 people to death in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. These events led an increase in Palestinian opposition to the peace process. Tragically, in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir – an extremist, causing political instability in the region.

The first-ever Palestinian general elections took place in 1996, resulting in Arafat&#x27;s re-election as president and the formation of a Palestinian Legislative Council. Initiating the implementation of the Oslo Accords, Israel began redeploying its forces from select Palestinian cities in the West Bank in 1997. Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority continued, albeit with slow progress and contentious debates on Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees in 1998. In 1997, Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian government signed the Hebron Protocol, which outlined the redeployment of Israeli forces from parts of Hebron in the West Bank, granting the government greater control over the city. Israel and the Palestinian government signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, aiming to advance the implementation of the Oslo Accords. The agreement included provisions for Israeli withdrawals and security cooperation.

The period of the Oslo Years brought a great prosperity to the government-controlled areas, despite some economic issues. The Palestinian Authority built the country&#x27;s second airport in Gaza, after the Jerusalem International Airport. Inaugural ceremony of the airport was attended by Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela. In 1999, Ehud Barak assumed the position of Israeli Prime Minister, renewing efforts to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians. The Camp David Summit in 2000 aimed to resolve the remaining issues but concluded without a comprehensive agreement, serving as a milestone in the peace process.

=== Second intifada and civil war ===
A peace summit between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak was mediated by Bill Clinton in 2000. It was supposed to be the final agreement ending conflict officially forever. However the agreement failed to address the Palestinian refugee issues, status of Jerusalem and Israeli security concerns. Both sides blamed each other for the summit failures. This became one of the main triggers for the uprising that would happen next. In September 2000, then opposition leader from the Likud Party, Ariel Sharon, made a proactive visit to the Temple Mount and delivered a controversial speech, which angered Palestinian Jerusalemites. The tensions escalated into riots. Bloody clashes took place around Jerusalem. Escalating violence resulted in the closure of Jerusalem Airport, which haven&#x27;t operated till date. More and more riots between Jews and Arabs took place in October 2000 in Israel.

In the same month, two Israeli soldiers were lynched and killed in Ramallah. Between November and December clashes between Palestinians and Israelis increased further. In 2001 Taba summit was held between Israel and Palestine. But the summit failed to implement and Ariel Sharon became prime minister in the 2001 elections. By 2001, attacks from Palestinian militant groups towards Israel increased. Gaza Airport was destroyed in an airstrike by the Israeli army in 2001, claiming itself in retaliation to previous attacks by Hamas. In January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos captured the &quot;Karine A&quot;, a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel. UNSC Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed a two-state solution and laid the groundwork for a road map for peace. Another attack by Hamas left 30 people killed in Netanya. A peace summit was organized by the Arab League in Beirut, which was endorsed by Arafat and nearly ignored by Israel.

In 2002, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield after the Passover massacre. Heavy fighting between IDF and Palestinian fighters took place in Jenin. The Church of the Nativity was besieged by the IDF for one week until successful negotiations took place, which resulted in withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the church. Between 2003 and 2004, people from Qawasameh tribe in Hebron were either killed or blew themselves in suicide bombing. Ariel Sharon ordered construction of barriers across Palestinian-controlled areas and Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent future attacks. Saddam Hussein provided financial support to Palestinian militants from Iraq during the intifada period, from 2000 until his overthrow in 2003. A peace proposal was made in 2003, which was supported by Arafat and rejected by Sharon. In 2004 Hamas&#x27;s leader and co-founder Ahmed Yassin was assassinated by the Israeli army in Gaza. Yasser Arafat was confined to his headquarters in Ramallah. On 11 November, Yasser Arafat died in Paris.

In the first week of 2005, Mahmoud Abbas was elected as the president of the State of Palestine. In 2005, Israel completely withdrew from the Gaza Strip by destroying its settlements over there. By 2005, the situation began de-escalating. In 2006, Hamas won in Palestinian legislative elections. This led to a political standoff with Fatah. Armed clashes took place across both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The clashes turned into a civil war, which ended in bloody clashes on the Gaza Strip. As a result, Hamas gained control over all the territory of Gaza. Hundreds of people were killed in the civil war, including militants and civilians. Since then Hamas has gained more independence in its military practices. Since 2007, Israel has been leading a partial blockade on Gaza. Another peace summit was organized by the Arab League in 2007, with the same offer which was presented at the 2002 summit. However the peace process could not progress. The PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters.

=== Continued conflict ===
The division between the West Bank and Gaza complicated efforts to achieve Palestinian unity and negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel. Multiple rounds of reconciliation talks were held, but no lasting agreement was reached. The division also hindered the establishment of a unified Palestinian state and led to different governance structures and policies in the two territories.

Throughout this period, there were sporadic outbreaks of violence and tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. Since 2001, Incidents of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli territory and Israeli military operations in response often resulted in casualties and further strained the situation. Following the inter-Palestinian conflict in 2006, Hamas took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and Fatah took control of the West Bank. From 2007, the Gaza Strip was governed by Hamas, and the West Bank by the Fatah party led Palestinian Authority.

International efforts to revive the peace process continued. The United States, under the leadership of different administrations, made various attempts to broker negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

However, significant obstacles such as settlement expansion, the status of Jerusalem, borders, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees, remained unresolved. In recent years, diplomatic initiatives have emerged, including the normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. These agreements, while not directly addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have reshaped regional dynamics and raised questions about the future of Palestinian aspirations for statehood. The status quo remains challenging for Palestinians, with ongoing issues of occupation, settlement expansion, restricted movement, and economic hardships.

The most recent outbreak of violence in the region is the Israel-Hamas war (2023–present), involving fighting between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian forces in the Gaza Strip, with a simultaneous spillover of the war occurring in the West Bank.

== Geography ==

Areas claimed by the country, known as the Palestinian territories, lie in the Southern Levant of the Middle East region. Palestine is part of the Fertile Crescent, along with Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. The Gaza Strip borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east. The West Bank is bordered by Jordan to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west. Palestine shares its maritime borders with Israel, Egypt and Cyprus. Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by the State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by Israel. These areas would constitute the world&#x27;s 163rd largest country by land area.

The West Bank is a mountainous region. It is divided in three regions, namely the Mount Nablus (&quot;Jabal Nablus&quot;), the Hebron Hills and Jerusalem Mountains (&quot;Jibal al–Quds&quot;). The Samarian Hills and Judean Hills are mountain ranges in the West Bank, with Mount Nabi Yunis at a height of in Hebron Governorate as their highest peak. Until 19th century, Hebron was highest city in the Middle East. While Jerusalem is located on a plateau in the central highlands and is surrounded by valleys. The territory consists of fertile valleys, such as the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan River Valley. Palestine is home to world&#x27;s largest olive tree, located in Jerusalem. Around 45% of Palestine&#x27;s land is dedicated to growing olive trees.

Palestine features significant lakes and rivers that play a vital role in its geography and ecosystems. The Jordan River flows southward, forming part of Palestine&#x27;s eastern border and passing through the Sea of Galilee before reaching the Dead Sea. According to Christian traditions, it is site of the baptism of Jesus. The Dead Sea, bordering the country&#x27;s east is the lowest point on the earth. Jericho, located nearby, is the lowest city in the world. Villages and suburban areas around Jerusalem are home to ancient water bodies. There are several river valleys (&quot;wadi)&quot; across the country. These waterways provide essential resources for agriculture and recreation while supporting various ecosystems.

Three terrestrial ecoregions are found in the area: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests, Arabian Desert, and Mesopotamian shrub desert. Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by the ongoing dispute.

=== Climate ===
Temperatures in Palestine vary widely. The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate. Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being . The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at . Rain is scarce and generally falls between November and March, with annual precipitation rates approximately at .

=== Biodiversity ===

Palestine does not have officially recognized national parks or protected areas. However, there are areas within the West Bank that are considered to have ecological and cultural significance and are being managed with conservation efforts. These areas are often referred to as nature reserves or protected zones. Located near Jericho in the West Bank, Wadi Qelt is a desert valley with unique flora and fauna.

The reserve is known for its rugged landscapes, natural springs, and historical sites such as the St. George Monastery. Efforts have been made to protect the biodiversity and natural beauty of the area. The Judaean Desert is popular for &quot;Judaean Camels&quot;. Qalqilya Zoo in Qalqilya Governorate, is the only zoo currently active in the country. Gaza Zoo was closed due to poor conditions. Israeli government have built various national parks in the Area C, which is also considered illegal under international law.

== Government and politics ==



Palestine operates a semi-presidential system of government. The country consists of the institutions that are associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which includes the President of the State of Palestine, who is appointed by the Palestinian Central Council, the Palestinian National Council, and the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which performs the functions of a government in exile, maintaining an extensive foreign-relations network. The PLO is combination of several political parties.

These should be distinguished from the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Palestinian Legislative Council, and PNA Cabinet, all of which are instead associated with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Palestine&#x27;s founding document is the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, which should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO Palestinian National Covenant and PNA Palestine Basic Law.

The Palestinian government is divided into two geographic entities – the Palestinian Authority governed by Fatah, which has partial control over the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, which is under control of the militant group Hamas. Fatah is a secular party that was founded by Yasser Arafat and enjoys relatively good relations with the western powers. On the other hand, Hamas is a militant group based on Palestinian nationalist and Islamic ideology, inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas has tense relations with the United States, but receives support from Iran. Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is another popular secular party, which was founded by George Habash. Mahmoud Abbas is the president of the country since 2005. Mohammad Shtayyeh was the prime minister of Palestine, who resigned in 2024. In 2024, Mohammad Mustafa was appointed as the new prime minister of the country, after resigning of Shtayyeh. Yahya Sinwar was leader of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip before his death on 16 October 2024. According to Freedom House, the PNA governs Palestine in an authoritarian manner, including by repressing activists and journalists critical of the government.

Jerusalem including &quot;Haram ash-Sharif&quot;, is claimed as capital by Palestine, which has been under occupation by Israel. Currently the temporary administration center is in Ramallah, which is 10km from Jerusalem. &quot;Muqata&quot; hosts state ministries and representative office. In 2000, a government building was built in Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis, to house office of Yasser Arafat and Palestinian parliament. Since second intifada, condition of the town made this site unsuitable to operate as a capital, either temporarily or permanently. Nevertheless, the Palestinian entity have maintained their presence in the city. As few parts of the city is also under Palestinian control and many some countries have their consulates in Jerusalem.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The State of Palestine is divided into sixteen administrative divisions. The governorates in the West Bank are grouped into three areas per the Oslo II Accord. Area A forms 18% of the West Bank by area, and is administered by the Palestinian government. Area B forms 22% of the West Bank, and is under Palestinian civil control, and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control. Area C, except East Jerusalem, forms 60% of the West Bank, and is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration, however, the Palestinian government provides the education and medical services to the 150,000 Palestinians in the area, an arrangement agreed upon in the Oslo II accord by Israeli and Palestinian leadership. More than 99% of Area C is off limits to Palestinians, due to security concerns and is a point of ongoing negotiation. There are about 330,000 Israelis living in settlements in Area C. Although Area C is under martial law, Israelis living there are entitled to full civic rights. Palestinian enclaves currently under Palestinian administration in red (Areas A and B; not including Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule).

East Jerusalem (comprising the small pre-1967 Jordanian eastern-sector Jerusalem municipality together with a significant area of the pre-1967 West Bank demarcated by Israel in 1967) is administered as part of the Jerusalem District of Israel but is claimed by Palestine as part of the Jerusalem Governorate. It was effectively annexed by Israel in 1967, by application of Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration under a 1948 law amended for the purpose, this purported annexation being constitutionally reaffirmed (by implication) in Basic Law: Jerusalem 1980, but this annexation is not recognised by any other country. In 2010 of the 456,000 people in East Jerusalem, roughly 60% were Palestinians and 40% were Israelis. However, since the late 2000s, Israel&#x27;s West Bank Security Barrier has effectively re-annexed tens of thousands of Palestinians bearing Israeli ID cards to the West Bank, leaving East Jerusalem within the barrier with a small Israeli majority (60%). Under Oslo Accords, Jerusalem was proposed to be included in future negotiations and according to Israel, Oslo Accords prohibits the Palestinian Authority to operates in Jerusalem. However, certain parts of Jerusalem, those neighborhoods which are located outside the historic Old City but are part of East Jerusalem, were allotted to the Palestinian Authority.a


=== Foreign relations ===
Foreign relations are maintained in the framework of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the State of Palestine and maintains embassies in countries that recognize it. It also participates in international organizations as a member, associate, or observer. In some cases, due to conflicting sources, it is difficult to determine if the participation is on behalf of the State of Palestine, the PLO as a non-state entity, or the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The Vatican shifted recognition to the State of Palestine in May 2015, following the 2012 UN vote. This change aligned with the Holy See&#x27;s evolving position.

Currently, 146 UN member states (75%) recognize the State of Palestine. Though some do not recognize it, they acknowledge the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. The PLO&#x27;s executive committee acts as the government, empowered by the PNC. It is a full member of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Union for the Mediterranean. Sweden took a significant step in 2013 by upgrading the status of the Palestinian representative office to a full embassy. They became the first EU member state outside the former communist bloc to officially recognize the state of Palestine.

Members of the Arab League and member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation have strongly supported the country&#x27;s position in its conflict with Israel. Iran has been a strong ally of Palestine since the Islamic revolution and has provided military support to Palestinian fedayeen and militant groups, including Hamas through its Axis of Resistance, which includes a military coalition of governments and rebels from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Hamas is also part of the axis of resistance. Even before the emergence of the Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Iraq was a strong supporter of Palestine when it was under the Ba&#x27;athist government of Saddam Hussein. Turkey is a supporter of Hamas and Qatar has been a key-financial supporter and has hosted Hamas leaders. In 1988, as part of the request to admit it to UNESCO, an explanatory note was prepared that listed 92 states that had recognized the State of Palestine, including both Arab and non-Arab states such as India. Once a strong ally of Palestine, India has strengthened its ties with Israel since 1991.

Muammar Gaddafi of Libya was a supporter of Palestinian independence and was sought as a mediator in the Arab–Israeli conflict when he presented a one-state peace offer titled &quot;Isratin&quot; in 2000. Relations with the United Arab Emirates deteriorated when it signed normalization agreement with Israel. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, the PLO provided training for Tamil rebels to fight against the Sri Lankan government. The Republic of Ireland, Venezuela and South Africa are political allies of Palestine and have strongly advocated for establishment of independent Palestine. As a result of the ongoing war, support for the country has increased. Since Israel&#x27;s invasion of Gaza, many countries in support of Palestinians have officially recognized the country. This includes Armenia, Spain, Norway, The Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago.

=== Status and recognition ===
The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared the establishment of the State of Palestine on 15 November 1988. There is a wide range of views on the legal status of the State of Palestine, both among international states and legal scholars. The existence of a state of Palestine is recognized by the states that have established bilateral diplomatic relations with it. In January 2015, the International Criminal Court affirmed Palestine&#x27;s &quot;State&quot; status after its UN observer recognition, a move condemned by Israeli leaders as a form of &quot;diplomatic terrorism&quot;. In December 2015, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources in the occupied territories. It called on Israel to cease exploitation and damage while granting Palestinians the right to seek restitution. In 1988, the State of Palestine&#x27;s declaration of independence was acknowledged by the General Assembly with Resolution 43/177. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 67/19, granting Palestine &quot;non-member observer state&quot; status, effectively recognizing it as a sovereign state.

In August 2015, Palestine&#x27;s representatives at the United Nations presented a draft resolution that would allow the non-member observer states Palestine and the Holy See to raise their flags at the United Nations headquarters. Initially, the Palestinians presented their initiative as a joint effort with the Holy See, which the Holy See denied. In a letter to the Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly, Israel&#x27;s Ambassador at the UN Ron Prosor called the step &quot;another cynical misuse of the UN ... in order to score political points&quot;. After the vote, which was passed by 119 votes to 8 with 45 countries abstaining, the US Ambassador Samantha Power said that &quot;raising the Palestinian flag will not bring Israelis and Palestinians any closer together&quot;. US Department of State spokesman Mark Toner called it a &quot;counterproductive&quot; attempt to pursue statehood claims outside of a negotiated settlement.

At the ceremony itself, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the occasion was a &quot;day of pride for the Palestinian people around the world, a day of hope&quot;, and declared &quot;Now is the time to restore confidence by both Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful settlement and, at last, the realization of two states for two peoples.&quot;

=== International recognition ===
The State of Palestine has been recognized by 146 of the 193 UN members and since 2012 has had a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations. This limited status is largely due to the fact that the United States, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power, has consistently used its veto or threatened to do so to block Palestine&#x27;s full UN membership.

On 29 November 2012, in a 138–9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences), the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19, upgrading Palestine from an &quot;observer entity&quot; to a &quot;non-member observer state&quot; within the United Nations System, which was described as recognition of the PLO&#x27;s sovereignty. Palestine&#x27;s UN status is equivalent to that of the Holy See.

The UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as &quot;The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations&quot;, and Palestine has instructed its diplomats to officially represent &quot;The State of Palestine&quot;—no longer the Palestinian National Authority. On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon declared that &quot;the designation of &#x27;State of Palestine&#x27; shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents&quot;, thus recognising the title &#x27;State of Palestine&#x27; as the state&#x27;s official name for all UN purposes; on 21 December 2012, a UN memorandum discussed appropriate terminology to be used following GA 67/19. It was noted therein that there was no legal impediment to using the designation Palestine to refer to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory. At the same time, it was explained that there was also no bar to the continued use of the term &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem&quot; or such other terminology as might customarily be used by the Assembly. () of the member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine. Many of the countries that do not recognise the State of Palestine nevertheless recognise the PLO as the &quot;representative of the Palestinian people&quot;. The PLO&#x27;s Executive Committee is empowered by the Palestinian National Council to perform the functions of government of the State of Palestine.

On 2 April 2024, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, requested that the Security Council consider a renewed application for membership. As of April, seven UNSC members recognize Palestine but the US has indicated that it opposes the request and in addition, US law stipulates that US funding for the UN would be cut off in the event of full recognition without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. On 18 April, the US vetoed a widely supported UN resolution that would have admitted Palestine as a full UN member.

A May 2024 UNGA resolution came into force with the 2024 general assembly. The resolution, which recognized the Palestinian right to become a full member state, also granted the right to Palestinians to submit proposals and amendments and Palestine was permitted to take a seat with other member states in the assembly.

=== Military ===

The Palestinian Security Services consists of the armed forces and intelligence agencies, which were established during the Oslo Accords. Their function is to maintain internal security and enforce law in the PA-controlled areas. It does not operate as an independent armed force of a country. Before the Oslo Accords, the PLO led armed rebellion against Israel, which included coalition of militant groups and included its own military branch – the Palestine Liberation Army. However, since the 1993–1995 agreements, it has been inactive and operates only in Syria. Palestinian fedayeen are the Palestinian militants and guerilla army. They are considered as &quot;freedom fighter&quot; by Palestinians and &quot;terrorists&quot; by Israelis. Hamas considers itself as an independent force, which is more powerful and influential than PSF, along with other militant organizations such as Islamic Jihad (Al-Quds Bridage). It is a guerilla army, which is supported by Iran, Qatar and Turkey. According to the CIA World Factbook, the Qassam Brigades have 20,000 to 25,000 members, although this number is disputed. Israel&#x27;s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to develop its military wing.

Iran and Hezbollah have smuggled weapons to Hamas overland through the Sinai Peninsula via Sudan and Libya, as well as by sea. Intensive military training and accumulated weapons have allowed Hamas to gradually organize regional units as large as brigades containing 2,500–3,500 fighters each. Since 2020, joint exercises conducted with other militant groups in Gaza like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have habituated units to operating in a coordinated fashion, supported Hamas command and control, and facilitated cooperation between Hamas and smaller factions. Such efforts began in earnest in 2007, upon Hamas&#x27;s seizure of power in the Gaza Strip. Iran has since supplied materiel and know-how for Hamas to build a sizable rocket arsenal, with more than 10,000 rockets and mortar shells fired in the current conflict. With Iran&#x27;s help, Hamas has developed robust domestic rocket production that uses pipes, electrical wiring, and other everyday materials for improvised production.

The State of Palestine has a number of security forces, including a Civil Police Force, National Security Forces and Intelligence Services, with the function of maintaining security and protecting Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian State. All of these forces are part of Palestinian Security Services. The PSF is primarily responsible for maintaining internal security, law enforcement, and counterterrorism operations in areas under Palestinian Authority control.

The Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) is the standing army of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was established during the early years of the Palestinian national movement but has largely been inactive since the Oslo Accords. The PLA&#x27;s role was intended to be a conventional military force but has shifted to a more symbolic and political role.

== Economy ==
Palestine is classified as a middle income and developing country by the IMF. In 2023, GDP of the country was $40 billion and per-capita around $4,500. Due to its disputed status, the economic condition have been affected. The CO2 emission (metric tons per capita) was 0.6 in 2010. According to a survey of 2011, Palestine&#x27;s poverty rate was 25.8%. According to a new World Bank report, Palestinian economic growth is expected to soften in 2023. Economy of Palestine relies heavily on international aids, remittances by overseas Palestinians and local industries.

According to a report by the World Bank, the economic impact of Israel&#x27;s closure policy has been profound, directly contributing to a significant decline in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and a rise in poverty since the onset of the Second Intifada in September 2000. The Israeli restrictions imposed on Area C alone result in an estimated annual loss of approximately $3.4 billion, which accounts for nearly half of the current Palestinian GDP. These restrictions have severely hindered economic growth and development in the region. In the aftermath of the 2014 Gaza War, where many structures were damaged or destroyed, the flow of construction and raw materials into Gaza has been severely limited. Additionally, regular exports from the region have been completely halted, exacerbating the economic challenges faced by the population.

One of the burdensome measures imposed by Israel is the &quot;back-to-back&quot; system enforced at crossing points within Palestinian territories. This policy forces shippers to unload and reload their goods from one truck to another, resulting in significant transportation costs and longer transit times for both finished products and raw materials. These additional expenses further impede economic growth and viability. Under the 1995 Oslo II Accord, it was agreed that governance of Area C would be transferred to the Palestinian Authority within 18 months, except for matters to be determined in the final status agreement. However, Israel has failed to fulfill its obligations under the Oslo agreement, highlighting the urgent need for accountability and an end to impunity. The European Commission has highlighted the detrimental impact of the Israeli West Bank barrier, estimating that it has led to an annual economic impoverishment of Palestinians by 2–3% of GDP. Furthermore, the escalating number of internal and external closures continues to have a devastating effect on any prospects for economic recovery in the region.

According to a 2015 study, the economic impact of Israel&#x27;s illegal use of Palestinian natural resources was conservatively estimated at US$1.83 billion, equivalent to 22% of Palestine&#x27;s GDP that year. According to a World Bank report, the manufacturing sector&#x27;s share of GDP decreased from 19% to 10% between the signing of the Oslo Accords until 2011. The same report, which adopted conservative estimates, suggests that access to Area &#x27;C&#x27; in specific sectors like Dead Sea minerals, telecommunications, mining, tourism, and construction could contribute at least 22% to Palestinian GDP. In fact, the report notes that Israel and Jordan together generate around $4.2 billion annually from the sale of these products, representing 6% of the global potash supply and 73% of global bromine output. Overall, if Palestinians had unrestricted access to their own land in Area &#x27;C,&#x27; the potential economic benefits for Palestine could increase by 35% of GDP, amounting to at least $3.4 billion annually. Similarly, water restrictions incurred a cost of US$1.903 billion, equivalent to 23.4% of GDP, while Israel&#x27;s ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip resulted in a cost of $1.908 billion US$, representing 23.5% of GDP in 2010. These burdens are unsustainable for any economy, artificially limiting Palestine&#x27;s economic potential and its right to develop a prosperous society with a stable economy and sustainable growth.

The State of Palestine&#x27;s overall gross-domestic-product (GDP) has declined by 35% in the first quarter of 2024, due to the ongoing war in Gaza, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reports. There was a stark difference between the West Bank, which witnessed a decline of 25% and in the Gaza Strip, the number is 86% amid the ongoing war. The manufacturing sector decreased by 29% in the West Bank and 95% in Gaza, while the construction sector decreased by 42% in the West Bank and essentially collapsed in Gaza, with a 99% decrease.

=== Agriculture ===
After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, Palestinian agriculture suffered significant setbacks. The sector&#x27;s contribution to the GDP declined, and the agricultural labor force decreased. The cultivated areas in the West Bank continuously declined since 1967. Palestinian farmers face obstacles in marketing and distributing their products, and Israeli restrictions on water usage have severely affected Palestinian agriculture. Over 85% of Palestinian water from the West Bank aquifers is used by Israel, and Palestinians are denied access to water resources from the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers.

In Gaza, the coastal aquifer is suffering from saltwater intrusion. Israeli restrictions have limited irrigation of Palestinian land, with only 6% of West Bank land cultivated by Palestinians being irrigated, while Israeli settlers irrigate around 70% of their land. The Gulf War in 1991 had severe repercussions on Palestinian agriculture, as the majority of exports were previously sent to Arab Gulf countries. Palestinian exports to the Gulf States declined by 14% as a result of the war, causing a significant economic impact.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories are characterized by severe water shortage and are highly influenced by the Israeli occupation. The water resources of Palestine are partially controlled by Israel due in part from historical and geographical complexities with Israel granting partial autonomy in 2017. The division of groundwater is subject to provisions in the Oslo II Accord, agreed upon by both Israeli and Palestinian leadership. Israel provides the Palestinian territories water from its own water supply and desalinated water supplies, in 2012 supplying 52 MCM.

Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the Gaza Strip when compared to the West Bank. About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is lost in the distribution network. The lasting blockade of the Gaza Strip and the Gaza War have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.
Concerning wastewater, the existing treatment plants do not have the capacity to treat all of the produced wastewater, causing severe water pollution. The development of the sector highly depends on external financing.

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturing sectors in Palestine include textiles, food processing, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, furniture, plastic products, stone, and electronics. Notable products include clothing, olive oil, dairy, furniture, ceramics, and construction materials. Before the Second Intifada, Palestine had a strong industrial base in Jerusalem and Gaza. Barriers erected in the West Bank have made movement of goods difficult; the blockade of the Gaza Strip has severely affected the territory&#x27;s economic conditions. , according to the Ministry of Economy, the manufacturing sector expected to grow by 2.5% and create 79,000 jobs over the following six years. Palestine mainly exports articles of stone (limestone, marble – 13.3%), furniture (11.7%), plastics (10.2%) and iron and steel (9.1%). Most of these products are exported to Jordan, the United States, Israel and Egypt.

Hebron is industrially most advanced city in the region and serves as an export hub for Palestinian products. More than 40% of the national economy produced there. The most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Many quarries are in the surrounding region. Silicon reserves are found in the Gaza territory. Jerusalem stone, extracted in the West Bank, has been used for constructing many structures in Jerusalem. Hebron is widely known for its glass production. Nablus is noted for its Nablus soap. Some of the companies operating in the Palestinian territories include Siniora Foods, Sinokrot Industries, Schneider Electric, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.

Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts have resulted in several initiatives, such as the Valley of Peace initiative and Breaking the Impasse, which promote industrial projects between Israel, Palestine and other Arab countries, with the goal of promoting peace and ending conflict. These include joint industrial parks opened in Palestine. The Palestinian Authority has built industrial cities in Gaza, Bethlehem, Jericho, Jenin and Hebron. Some are in joint cooperation with European countries.

=== Energy ===
Palestine does not produce its own oil or gas. But as per UN reports, &quot;sizeable reserves of oil and gas&quot; lie in the Palestinian territories. Due to its state of conflict, most of the energy and fuel in Palestine are imported from Israel and other all neighboring countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

In 2012, electricity available in West Bank and Gaza was 5,370 GW-hour (3,700 in the West Bank and 1,670 in Gaza), while the annual per capita consumption of electricity (after deducting transmission loss) was 950 kWh. The Gaza Power Plant is the only power plant in the Gaza Strip. It is owned by Gaza Power Generating Company (GPGC), a subsidiary of the Palestine Electric Company (PEC). Jerusalem District Electricity Company, a subsidiary of PEC, provides electricity to Palestinian residents of Jerusalem.

Government officials have increasingly focused on solar energy to reduce dependency on Israel for energy. Palestine Investment Fund have launched &quot;Noor Palestine&quot;, a project which aims to provide power in Palestine. Qudra Energy, a joint venture between Bank of Palestine and NAPCO have established solar power plants across Jammala, Nablus, Birzeit and Ramallah. In 2019, under Noor Palestine campaign, first solar power plant and solar park was inaugurated in Jenin. Two more solar parks have been planned for Jericho and Tubas. A new solar power plant is under construction at Abu Dis campus of Al-Quds University, for serving Palestinian Jerusalemites.

=== Oil and gas ===
Palestine holds massive potential reserves of oil and gas. Over of oil are estimated to exist off the coast and beneath occupied Palestinian lands. The Levant Basin holds around of oil, with another beneath the occupied West Bank area. Around of oil reserves are believed to exist in shore of the Gaza Strip. According to a report by the UNCTAD, around of oil reserves are in the occupied Palestinian territory of the West Bank, probably the Meged oil field. As per the Palestinian Authority, 80% of this oil field falls under the lands owned by Palestinians.

Masadder, a subsidiary of the Palestine Investment Fund is developing the oilfield in the West Bank. Block-1 field, which spans an area of from northwest Ramallah to Qalqilya in Palestine, has significant potential for recoverable hydrocarbon resources. It is estimated to have a P90 (a level of certainty) of of recoverable oil and . The estimated cost for the development of the field is $390 million, and it will be carried out under a production sharing agreement with the Government of Palestine. Currently, an initial pre-exploration work program is underway to prepare for designing an exploration plan for approval, which will precede the full-fledged development of the field.

Natural gas in Palestine is mostly found in Gaza Strip. Gaza Marine is a natural gas field, located around from the coast of the territory in the Mediterranean shore. It holds gas reserves ranging between to . These estimates far exceed the needs of the Palestinian territories in energy. The gas field was discovered by the British Gas Group in 1999. Upon the discovery of the gas field, it was lauded by Yasser Arafat as a &quot;Gift from God&quot;. A regional cooperation between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and Egypt were signed for developing the field and Hamas also gave approval to the Palestinian Authority. However, since the ongoing war in Gaza, this project have been delayed.

=== Transportation ===
Two airports of Palestine – Jerusalem International Airport and Gaza International Airport – were destroyed by Israel in the early years of the second intifada. Since then no airport has been operational in the country. Palestinians used to travel through airports in Israel – Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport – and Queen Alia International Airport of Amman, capital of Jordan. Many proposals have been made by both the government and private entities to build airports in the country. In 2021, the most recent proposal was made by both the Palestinian government and Israeli government to redevelop Qalandia Airport as a binational airport for both Israelis and Palestinians.

Gaza Strip is the only coastal region of Palestine, where Port of Gaza is located. It is under naval siege by Israel, since the territory&#x27;s blockade. During Oslo years, the Palestinian government collaborated with the Netherlands and France to build an international seaport but the project was abandoned. In 2021, then prime minister of Israel Naftali Bennett launched a development project for Gaza, which would include a seaport.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism in the country refers to tourism in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 2010, 4.6million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2million were foreign tourists while 2.7million were domestic. Most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a day trip itinerary. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada. Lonely Planet travel guide writes that &quot;the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded.&quot; Sacred sites such as the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque draw countless pilgrims and visitors each year.

In 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister Rula Ma&#x27;ay&#x27;a stated that her government aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the occupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a major income source to Palestinians. There are no visa conditions imposed on foreign nationals other than those imposed by the visa policy of Israel. Access to Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza is completely controlled by the government of Israel. Entry to the occupied Palestinian territories requires only a valid international passport. Tourism is mostly centered around Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Jericho is a popular tourist spot for local Palestinians.

=== Communications ===

Palestine is known as the &quot;Silicon Valley of NGOs&quot;. The high tech industry in Palestine, have experienced good growth since 2008. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Ministry of Telecom and Information Technology said there were 4.2million cellular mobile subscribers in Palestine compared to 2.6million at the end of 2010 while the number of ADSL subscribers in Palestine increased to about 363 thousand by the end of 2019 from 119 thousand over the same period. 97% of Palestinian households have at least one cellular mobile line while at least one smartphone is owned by 86% of households (91% in the West Bank and 78% in Gaza Strip). About 80% of the Palestinian households have access to the internet in their homes and about a third have a computer.

On 12 June 2020, the World Bank approved a US$15million grant for the Technology for Youth and Jobs (&quot;TechStart&quot;) Project aiming to help the Palestinian IT sector upgrade the capabilities of firms and create more high-quality jobs. Kanthan Shankar, World Bank Country Director for West Bank and Gaza said 

=== Financial services ===
The Palestine Monetary Authority has issued guidelines for the operation and provision of electronic payment services including e-wallet and prepaid cards. Protocol on Economic Relations, also known as Paris Protocol was signed between the PLO and Israel, which prohibited Palestinian Authority from having its own currency. This agreement paved a way for the government to collect taxes.

Prior to 1994, the occupied Palestinian territories had limited banking options, with Palestinians avoiding Israeli banks. This resulted in an under-banked region and a cash-based economy. Currently, there are 14 banks operating in Palestine, including Palestinian, Jordanian, and Egyptian banks, compared to 21 in 2000. The number of banks has decreased over time due to mergers and acquisitions. Deposits in Palestinian banks have seen significant growth, increasing from US$1.2 billion in 2007 to US$6.9 billion in 2018, representing a 475% increase. The banking sector has shown impressive annual growth rates in deposits and loan portfolios, surpassing global averages.

The combined loan facilities provided by all banks on 31 December 2018, amounted to US$8.4 billion, marking a significant growth of 492 percent compared to US$1.42 billion in 2007. Palestinian registered banks accounted for US$0.60 billion or 42 percent of total deposits in 2007, while in 2018, the loans extended by Palestinian registered banks reached US$5.02 billion, representing 61 percent of total loans. This showcases a remarkable 737 percent increase between 2007 and 2018. Currently, Palestinian registered banks hold 57 percent of customer deposits and provide 61 percent of the loans, compared to 26 percent of deposits and 42 percent of loans in 2007.

== Demographics ==

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), as of 26 May 2021, the State of Palestine 2021 mid-year population is 5,227,193. Ala Owad, the president of the PCBS, estimated a population of 5.3million as of end year 2021. Within an area of , there is a population density of about 827 people per square kilometer. To put this in a wider context, the average population density of the world was 25 people per square kilometre as of 2017.

Half of the Palestinian population live in the diaspora or are refugees. Due to being in a state of conflict with Israel, the subsequent wars have resulted in the widespread displacement of Palestinians, known as &quot;Nakba&quot; or &quot;Naksa&quot;. In the 1948 war, around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled. Most of them are seeking refuge in neighboring Arab countries like Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt, while others live as expats in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait. A large number of Palestinians can be found in the United States, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.

Additionally, there are significant group of Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics (Melkites), and Protestant denominations.

With a population of 350 people, Samaritans are highly concentrated around the Mount Gerizim. Due to similarities between Samaritanism and Judaism, Samaritans are often referred to as &quot;the Jews of Palestine&quot;. The PLO considers those Jews as Palestinians, who lived in the region peacefully before the rise of Zionism. Certain individuals, especially anti-Zionists, consider themselves Palestinian Jews, such as Ilan Halevi and Uri Davis. Around 600,000 Israeli settlers, mostly Jews, live in the Israeli settlements, illegal under international law, across the West Bank. Jericho synagogue, situated in Jericho is the only synagogue maintained by the Palestinian Authority.

Since 1987, 400,000 to 500,000 Turks live in Palestine. Due to the 1947–1949 civil war, many Turkish families fled the region and settled in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. According to a 2022 news article by &quot;Al Monitor,&quot; many families of Turkish origin in Gaza have been migrating to Turkey due to the &quot;deteriorating economic conditions in the besieged enclave&quot;. Minorities of the country are also subjected to occupation and restrictions by Israel.

Culture of Palestine is an amalgamation of indigenous traditions, Arab customs, and the heritage of various empires that have ruled the region. The land of Palestine has witnessed the presence of ancient civilizations such as the Canaanites, Philistines, and Israelites, each contributing to its cultural fabric. The Arab conquest in the 7th century brought the influence of Islam, which has been a cornerstone of Palestinian identity ever since. Islamic traditions, including language, art, and architecture, have infused the culture with distinct features.

Palestinian cultural expression often serves as a form of resistance against occupation and oppression. Street art, such as the work of Banksy in Bethlehem, and the annual Palestinian music and arts festival, Al-Mahatta, are examples of this cultural resistance. The Old City of Jerusalem, with its religious sites like the Western Wall, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, holds immense cultural and historical significance.

<doc id="241408" wikidata="Q7280126" url="?curid=241408" title="Rader's FFT algorithm">
<text>Rader&#x27;s algorithm (1968), named for Charles M. Rader of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of prime sizes by re-expressing the DFT as a cyclic convolution (the other algorithm for FFTs of prime sizes, Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm, also works by rewriting the DFT as a convolution).

Since Rader&#x27;s algorithm only depends upon the periodicity of the DFT kernel, it is directly applicable to any other transform (of prime order) with a similar property, such as a number-theoretic transform or the discrete Hartley transform.

The algorithm can be modified to gain a factor of two savings for the case of DFTs of real data, using a slightly modified re-indexing/permutation to obtain two half-size cyclic convolutions of real data; an alternative adaptation for DFTs of real data uses the discrete Hartley transform.

Winograd extended Rader&#x27;s algorithm to include prime-power DFT sizes formula_1, and today Rader&#x27;s algorithm is sometimes described as a special case of Winograd&#x27;s FFT algorithm, also called the &quot;multiplicative Fourier transform algorithm&quot; (Tolimieri et al., 1997), which applies to an even larger class of sizes. However, for composite sizes such as prime powers, the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm is much simpler and more practical to implement, so Rader&#x27;s algorithm is typically only used for large-prime base cases of Cooley–Tukey&#x27;s recursive decomposition of the DFT.

==Algorithm==

Begin with the definition of the discrete Fourier transform:

:formula_2

If &quot;N&quot; is a prime number, then the set of non-zero indices formula_3 forms a group under multiplication modulo &quot;N&quot;. One consequence of the number theory of such groups is that there exists a generator of the group (sometimes called a primitive root, which can be found by exhaustive search or slightly better algorithms). This generator is an integer &quot;g&quot; such that formula_4 for any non-zero index &quot;n&quot; and for a unique formula_5 (forming a bijection from &quot;q&quot; to non-zero &quot;n&quot;). Similarly, formula_6 for any non-zero index &quot;k&quot; and for a unique formula_7, where the negative exponent denotes the multiplicative inverse of formula_8. That means that we can rewrite the DFT using these new indices &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; as:

:formula_9

:formula_10

(Recall that &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; are implicitly periodic in &quot;N&quot;, and also that formula_11 (Euler&#x27;s identity). Thus, all indices and exponents are taken modulo &quot;N&quot; as required by the group arithmetic.)

The final summation, above, is precisely a cyclic convolution of the two sequences &quot;a&quot;&quot;q&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;q&quot; (of length &quot;N&quot;–1, because formula_5) defined by:

:formula_13
:formula_14

===Evaluating the convolution===

Since &quot;N&quot;–1 is composite, this convolution can be performed directly via the convolution theorem and more conventional FFT algorithms. However, that may not be efficient if &quot;N&quot;–1 itself has large prime factors, requiring recursive use of Rader&#x27;s algorithm. Instead, one can compute a length-(&quot;N&quot;–1) cyclic convolution exactly by zero-padding it to a length of at least 2(&quot;N&quot;–1)–1, say to a power of two, which can then be evaluated in O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) time without the recursive application of Rader&#x27;s algorithm.

This algorithm, then, requires O(&quot;N&quot;) additions plus O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) time for the convolution. In practice, the O(&quot;N&quot;) additions can often be performed by absorbing the additions into the convolution: if the convolution is performed by a pair of FFTs, then the sum of &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is given by the DC (0th) output of the FFT of &quot;a&quot;&quot;q&quot; plus &quot;x&quot;0, and &quot;x&quot;0 can be added to all the outputs by adding it to the DC term of the convolution prior to the inverse FFT. Still, this algorithm requires intrinsically more operations than FFTs of nearby composite sizes, and typically takes 3–10 times as long in practice.

If Rader&#x27;s algorithm is performed by using FFTs of size &quot;N&quot;–1 to compute the convolution, rather than by zero padding as mentioned above, the efficiency depends strongly upon &quot;N&quot; and the number of times that Rader&#x27;s algorithm must be applied recursively. The worst case would be if &quot;N&quot;–1 were 2&quot;N&quot;2 where &quot;N&quot;2 is prime, with &quot;N&quot;2–1 = 2&quot;N&quot;3 where &quot;N&quot;3 is prime, and so on. Such &quot;N&quot;j are called Sophie Germain primes, and such a sequence of them is called a Cunningham chain of the first kind. However, the alternative of zero padding can always be employed if &quot;N&quot;–1 has a large prime factor.
