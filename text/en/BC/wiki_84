<text>Keratoconus (KC) is a disorder of the eye that results in progressive thinning of the cornea. The protrusion of the cornea may result in blurry vision, double vision, nearsightedness, irregular astigmatism, and light sensitivity leading to poor quality-of-life. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases, a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.
While the cause is unknown, it is believed to occur due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. Patients with a parent, sibling, or child who has keratoconus have 15 to 67 times higher risk in developing corneal ectasia compared to patients with no affected relatives. Proposed environmental factors include rubbing the eyes and allergies. The underlying mechanism involves changes of the cornea to a cone shape. Diagnosis is most often by topography. Topography measures the curvature of the cornea and creates a colored &quot;map&quot; of the cornea. Keratoconus causes very distinctive changes in the appearance of these maps that allow doctors to make the diagnosis.
Initially, the condition can typically be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses. As the disease progresses, special contact lenses (such as scleral contact lenses) may be required. In most people, the disease stabilizes after a few years without severe vision problems. In 2016, the FDA approved corneal collagen cross-linking to halt the progression of keratoconus. In some cases when the cornea becomes dangerously thin or when sufficient vision can no longer be achieved by contact lenses due to steepening of the cornea, scarring, or lens intolerance, corneal cross-linking is not an option, and a corneal transplant may be required.
Keratoconus affects about 1 in 2,000 people. However, some estimates suggest that the incidence may be as high as 1 in 400 individuals. It occurs most commonly in late childhood to early adulthood. While it occurs in all populations, it may be more frequent in certain ethnic groups such as those of Asian descent. The word is from the Greek &quot;kéras&quot; meaning cornea and the Latin &quot;cōnus&quot; meaning cone.
== Signs and symptoms ==

People with early keratoconus often notice a minor blurring or distortion of their vision, as well as an increased sensitivity to light, so they may visit their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly due to irregular astigmatism. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than the other eye. The disease is often bilateral though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.

The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple &quot;ghost&quot; images, known as monocular polyopia. This effect is most clearly seen with a high contrast field, such as a point of light on a dark background. Instead of seeing just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. People also commonly notice streaking and flaring distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heartbeat.
The predominant optical aberration of the eye in keratoconus is coma. The visual distortion experienced by the person comes from two sources, one being the irregular deformation of the surface of the cornea, and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints. These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the retina. The effect can worsen in low light conditions, as the dark-adapted pupil dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea.

== Genetics ==
Six genes have been found to be associated with the condition. These genes include BANP-ZNF469, COL4A4, FOXO1, FNDC3B, IMMP2L and RXRA-COL5A1. Others likely also exist.

Patients with a parent, sibling, or child who has keratoconus have 15 to 67 times higher risk in developing corneal ectasia compared to patients with no affected relatives.

== Pathophysiology ==

Despite considerable research, the cause of keratoconus remains unclear. Several sources suggest that keratoconus likely arises from a number of different factors: genetic, environmental or cellular, any of which may form the trigger for the onset of the disease. Once initiated, the disease normally develops by progressive dissolution of Bowman&#x27;s layer, which lies between the corneal epithelium and stroma. As the two come into contact, cellular and structural changes in the cornea adversely affect its integrity and lead to the bulging and scarring characteristic of the disorder. Within any individual keratoconic cornea, regions of degenerative thinning coexisting with regions undergoing wound healing may be found. Scarring appears to be an aspect of the corneal degradation; however, a recent, large, multicenter study suggests abrasion by contact lenses may increase the likelihood of this finding by a factor over two.

A number of studies have indicated keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases, a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors. Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase may be responsible for a build-up of free radicals and oxidising species in the cornea. Whatever the pathogenetical process, the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation. While keratoconus is considered a noninflammatory disorder, one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in the tear fluid.

A genetic predisposition to keratoconus has been observed, with the disease running in certain families, and incidences reported of concordance in identical twins. The frequency of occurrence in close family members is not clearly defined, though it is known to be considerably higher than that in the general population, and studies have obtained estimates ranging between 6% and 19%. Two studies involving isolated, largely homogenetic communities have contrarily mapped putative gene locations to chromosomes 16q and 20q. Most genetic studies agree on an autosomal dominant model of inheritance. A rare, autosomal dominant form of severe keratoconus with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of mir-184, a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens. Keratoconus is diagnosed more often in people with Down&#x27;s syndrome, though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined.

Researches also have shed light on the role of hormones in the pathophysiology of keratoconus. Hormones such as androgen, prolactin, estrogen and progesterone have been shown to influence corneal biomechanics and tissue remodeling, potentially affecting the integrity of the cornea in individuals predisposed to keratoconus. Moreover, fluctuations in hormonal levels during puberty and pregnancy have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of keratoconus in some cases.

Keratoconus has been associated with atopic diseases, which include asthma, allergies, and eczema, and it is not uncommon for several or all of these diseases to affect one person. Keratoconus is also associated with Alport syndrome, Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome. A number of studies suggest vigorous eye rubbing contributes to the progression of keratoconus, and people should be discouraged from the practice. Keratoconus differs from ectasia, which is caused by LASIK eye surgery. Post-LASIK Ectasia has been associated with the excessive removal of the eye&#x27;s stromal bed tissue during surgery.

== Diagnosis ==
Prior to any physical examination, the diagnosis of keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist&#x27;s or optometrist&#x27;s assessment of the person&#x27;s medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury that might affect vision, and the presence of any family history of ocular disease. An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person&#x27;s visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument&#x27;s measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person&#x27;s retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors.

If keratoconus is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will search for other characteristic findings of the disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring can be observed in around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt&#x27;s striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person&#x27;s gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson&#x27;s sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson&#x27;s sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.

A handheld keratoscope, sometimes known as &quot;Placido&#x27;s disk&quot;, can provide a simple noninvasive visualization of the surface of the cornea by projecting a series of concentric rings of light onto the cornea. A more definitive diagnosis can be obtained using corneal topography, in which an automated instrument projects the illuminated pattern onto the cornea and determines its topography from analysis of the digital image. The topographical map indicates any distortions or scarring in the cornea, with keratoconus revealed by a characteristic steepening of curvature that is usually below the centerline of the eye. The technique can record a snapshot of the degree and extent of the deformation as a benchmark for assessing its rate of progression. It is of particular value in detecting the disorder in its early stages when other signs have not yet presented.

=== Stages ===

Once keratoconus has been diagnosed, its degree may be classified by several metrics:
* The steepness of greatest curvature from &#x27;mild&#x27; (&lt; 45 D), &#x27;advanced&#x27; (up to 52 D) or &#x27;severe&#x27; (&gt; 52 D);
* The morphology of the cone: &#x27;nipple&#x27; (small: 5 mm and near-central), &#x27;oval&#x27; (larger, below-center and often sagging), or &#x27;globus&#x27; (more than 75% of cornea affected);
* The corneal thickness from mild (&gt; 506 μm) to advanced (&lt; 446 μm).

Increasing use of corneal topography has led to a decline in use of these terms.

== Treatment ==

=== Lenses ===

In early stages of keratoconus, glasses or soft contact lenses can suffice to correct for the mild astigmatism. As the condition progresses, these may no longer provide the person with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity, and most practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses, known as rigid, gas-permeable, (RGP) lenses. RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction, but do not arrest progression of the condition.

In people with keratoconus, rigid contact lenses improve vision by means of tear fluid filling the gap between the irregular corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens, thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea. Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for keratoconus, and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea, and contact lens fitters who have experience managing people with keratoconus. The irregular cone presents a challenge and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact, stability and steepness. Some trial-and-error fitting may prove necessary.

==== Hybrid lenses ====
Traditionally, contact lenses for keratoconus have been the &#x27;hard&#x27; or RGP variety, although manufacturers have also produced specialized &#x27;soft&#x27; or hydrophilic lenses and, most recently, silicone hydrogel lenses. A soft lens has a tendency to conform to the conical shape of the cornea, thus diminishing its effect. To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed that are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt. However, soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective for every person. Early generation lenses have been discontinued. The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved, giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.

==== Scleral lenses ====
Scleral lenses are sometimes prescribed for cases of advanced or very irregular keratoconus; these lenses cover a greater proportion of the surface of the eye and hence can offer improved stability. Easier handling can find favor with people with reduced dexterity, such as the elderly.

==== Piggybacking ====
Some people find good vision correction and comfort with a &quot;piggyback&quot; lens combination, in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses, both providing a degree of vision correction. One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a countersunk central area to accept the rigid lens. Fitting a piggyback lens combination requires experience on the part of the lens fitter, and tolerance on the part of the person with keratoconus.

=== Surgery ===

==== Corneal transplant ====

Between 11% and 27% of cases of keratoconus will progress to a point where vision correction is no longer possible, thinning of the cornea becomes excessive, or scarring as a result of contact lens wear causes problems of its own, and a corneal transplantation or penetrating keratoplasty becomes required. Keratoconus is the most common grounds for conducting a penetrating keratoplasty, generally accounting for around a quarter of such procedures. The corneal transplant surgeon trephines a lenticule of corneal tissue and then grafts the donor cornea to the existing eye tissue, usually using a combination of running and individual sutures. The cornea does not have a direct blood supply, so the donor tissue is not required to be blood type matched. Eye banks check the donor corneas for any disease or cellular irregularities.

The acute recovery period can take four to six weeks, and full postoperative vision stabilization often takes a year or more, but most transplants are very stable in the long term. The National Keratoconus Foundation reports that penetrating keratoplasty has the most successful outcome of all transplant procedures, and when performed for keratoconus in an otherwise healthy eye, its success rate can be 95% or greater. The sutures used usually dissolve over a period of three to five years, but individual sutures can be removed during the healing process if they are causing irritation to the person.

In the US, corneal transplants (also known as corneal grafts) for keratoconus are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, the operation is commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) for a number of years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.

One way of reducing the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person&#x27;s rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet&#x27;s membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.

===== Epikeratophakia =====
Rarely, a nonpenetrating keratoplasty known as an epikeratophakia (or epikeratoplasty) may be performed in cases of keratoconus. The corneal epithelium is removed and a lenticule of donor cornea is grafted on top of it. The procedure requires a greater level of skill on the part of the surgeon, and is less frequently performed than a penetrating keratoplasty, as the outcome is generally less favorable. However, it may be seen as an option in a number of cases, particularly for young people.

==== Corneal ring implants ====
A possible surgical alternative to corneal transplant is the insertion of intrastromal corneal ring segments. A small incision is made in the periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of polymethyl methacrylate are slid between the layers of the stroma on either side of the pupil before the incision is closed by a suture. The segments push out against the curvature of the cornea, flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape. The procedure offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially exchangeable as it involves no removal of eye tissue.

Corneal intrastromal implantation surgery involving the implantation of a full ring is also available as a treatment option for keratoconus. Evidence supports that the full-ring implant improves vision outcomes for at least a year.

==== Cross-linking ====
Corneal collagen cross-linking is a developing treatment that aims to strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus. In 2016, however, the FDA approved cross-linking surgery as a treatment for keratoconus and recommended that a registry system should be set-up to evaluate the long-term treatment effect. The Save Sight Keratoconus Registry is an international database of keratoconus patients that is tracking outcomes of cross-linking in patients with keratoconus.

==== Radial keratotomy ====
Radial keratotomy is a refractive surgery procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for myopia has been largely superseded by LASIK and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea. For similar reasons, radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for people with keratoconus.

== Prognosis ==

Patients with keratoconus typically present initially with mild astigmatism and myopia, commonly at the onset of puberty, and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood. A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life. Patients&#x27; vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, contact lenses are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.

=== Corneal hydrops ===
In advanced cases, bulging of the cornea can result in a localized rupture of Descemet&#x27;s membrane, an inner layer of the cornea. Aqueous humor from the eye&#x27;s anterior chamber seeps into the cornea before Descemet&#x27;s membrane reseals. The patient experiences pain and a sudden severe clouding of vision, with the cornea taking on a translucent milky-white appearance known as a corneal hydrops.

Although disconcerting to the patient, the effect is normally temporary and after a period of six to eight weeks, the cornea usually returns to its former transparency. The recovery can be aided nonsurgically by bandaging with an osmotic saline solution. Although a hydrops usually causes increased scarring of the cornea, occasionally it will benefit a patient by creating a flatter cone, aiding the fitting of contact lenses. Corneal transplantation is not usually indicated during corneal hydrops.

== Epidemiology ==
The National Eye Institute reports keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy in the United States, affecting about one in 2,000 Americans, but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500. In the pediatric populations, ages three to 18, the prevalence of keratoconus was found to be as high as one in 334 children. The inconsistency may be due to variations in diagnostic criteria, with some cases of severe astigmatism interpreted as those of keratoconus, and&quot; vice versa&quot;. A long-term study found a mean incidence rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population per year. Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence amongst females, or that people of South Asian ethnicity are 4.4 times as likely to develop keratoconus as Caucasians, and are also more likely to be affected with the condition earlier.

Keratoconus is normally bilateral (affecting both eyes) although the distortion is usually asymmetric and is rarely completely identical in both corneas. Unilateral cases tend to be uncommon, and may in fact be very rare if a very mild condition in the better eye is simply below the limit of clinical detection. It is common for keratoconus to be diagnosed first in one eye and not until later in the other. As the condition then progresses in both eyes, the vision in the earlier-diagnosed eye will often remain poorer than that in its fellow.

== History ==

The German oculist Burchard Mauchart provided an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation of a case of keratoconus, which he called &quot;staphyloma diaphanum&quot;. However, it was not until 1854 that British physician John Nottingham (1801–1856) clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other ectasias of the cornea. Nottingham reported the cases of &quot;conical cornea&quot; that had come to his attention, and described several classic features of the disease, including polyopia, weakness of the cornea, and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient&#x27;s vision. In 1859, British surgeon William Bowman used an ophthalmoscope (recently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to diagnose keratoconus, and described how to angle the instrument&#x27;s mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea. Bowman also attempted to restore vision by pulling on the iris with a fine hook inserted through the cornea and stretching the pupil into a vertical slit, like that of a cat. He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique, restoring vision to an 18-year-old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8 inches (20 cm).

By 1869, when the pioneering Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Horner wrote a thesis entitled &quot;On the treatment of keratoconus&quot;, the disorder had acquired its current name. The treatment at that time, endorsed by the leading German ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe, was an attempt to physically reshape the cornea by chemical cauterization with a silver nitrate solution and application of a miosis-causing agent with a pressure dressing. In 1888, the treatment of keratoconus became one of the first practical applications of the then newly invented contact lens, when the French physician Eugène Kalt manufactured a glass scleral shell that improved vision by compressing the cornea into a more regular shape. Since the start of the 20th century, research on keratoconus has both improved understanding of the disease and greatly expanded the range of treatment options. The first successful corneal transplantation to treat keratoconus was done in 1936 by Ramón Castroviejo.

== Society and culture ==
According to the findings of the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK), people who have keratoconus could be expected to pay more than $25,000 over their lifetime post-diagnosis, with a standard deviation of $19,396. There is limited evidence on the costs of corneal cross-linking, a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK National Health Service, but this may be as high as $6,500 per eye in other countries. A 2013 cost-benefit analysis by the Lewin Group for Eye Bank Association of America, estimated an average cost of $16,500 for each corneal transplant.

=== Notable individuals with keratoconus ===
The following individuals have publicly stated they have keratoconus:
*Stephen Curry, American basketball player
*Ashton Irwin, Australian musician
*Mandy Patinkin, American actor
*Michaela Strachan, British TV presenter

== Related disorders ==
Several other corneal ectatic disorders also cause thinning of the cornea:
* Keratoglobus is a very rare condition that causes corneal thinning primarily at the margins, resulting in a spherical, slightly enlarged eye. It may be genetically related to keratoconus.
* Pellucid marginal degeneration causes thinning of a narrow (1–2 mm) band of the cornea, usually along the inferior corneal margin. It causes irregular astigmatism that, in the early stages of the disease can be corrected by spectacles. Differential diagnosis may be made by slit-lamp examination.
* Posterior keratoconus, a distinct disorder despite its similar name, is a rare abnormality, usually congenital, which causes a nonprogressive thinning of the inner surface of the cornea, while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal. Usually only a single eye is affected.
* Post-LASIK ectasia is a complication of LASIK eye surgery.

<text>The Florentine florin was a gold coin (in Italian &quot;Fiorino d&#x27;oro&quot;) struck from 1252 to 1533 with no significant change in its design or metal content standard during that time. 

It had 54 grains () of nominally pure or &#x27;fine&#x27; gold with a purchasing power difficult to estimate (and variable) but ranging according to social grouping and perspective from approximately 140 to 1,000 modern US dollars. The name of the coin comes from the &quot;Giglio bottonato&quot; (it), the floral emblem of the city, which is represented at the head of the coin.

==History==

The &quot;fiorino d&#x27;oro&quot; (gold florin) was minted in the Republic of Florence after the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade disrupted the minting of fine gold coins in the Byzantine Empire. It came to be accepted across Europe like the Byzantine Solidus had been. The territorial usage of the &quot;lira&quot; and the florin often overlapped; where the lira was used for smaller transactions (wages, food purchases), the florin was for larger transactions such as those used in dowries, international trade or for tax-related matters.

The first minting of the florin occurred in 1252. At the time the value of the florin was equal to the &quot;lira&quot;, but by 1500 the florin had appreciated; seven &quot;lire&quot; amounted to one florin.

In the 14th century, about 150 European states and local coin-issuing authorities made their own copies of the florin. The most important of these was the Hungarian forint, because the Kingdom of Hungary was a major source of European gold (until mining in the New World began to contribute to the supply in the 16th and 17th centuries, most of the gold used in Europe came from Africa).

The design of the original Florentine florins was the distinctive fleur-de-lis badge of the city on one side and on the other a standing and facing figure of St. John the Baptist wearing a cilice. On other countries&#x27; florins, the inscriptions were changed (from &quot;Florentia&quot; around the fleur, and the name of the saint on the other), and local heraldic devices were substituted for the fleur-de-lis. Later, other figures were often substituted for St. John. On the Hungarian forints, St. John was re-labelled St. Ladislaus, an early Christian king and patron saint of Hungary, and a battle axe substituted for the original&#x27;s sceptre. Gradually the image became more regal looking.

==Other coins==
The term &quot;florin&quot; was borrowed elsewhere in Europe. A variant of the florin was the Rheingulden, minted by several German states encompassing the commercial centers of the Rhein (Rhine) River valley, under a series of monetary conventions starting in 1354, initially at a standard practically identical to the Florentine florin (98% gold, 3.54 grams). By 1419, the weight had been slightly reduced (to 3.51 grams) and the alloy was substantially reduced (to 79% gold). By 1626, the alloy had been slightly reduced again (to 77% gold), while the weight was more substantially reduced (to 3.240 grams). In 1409, the Rheingulden standard (at the time 91.7% gold) was adopted for the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s Reichsgulden.

The Dutch guilder is symbolized as Fl. or ƒ, which means florijn (florin). 

The English coin first issued in 1344 by Edward III of England is also known as a florin. Originally valued at six shillings, it was composed of 108 grains (6.99828 grams) of gold with a purity of 23 carats and grains (or carats) – and more recently (minted between 1849-1967 although circulating alongside the decimal ten pence coin until 1993 when it was withdrawn due to a resizing) relating to a British pre-decimal silver coin (later nickel silver) also known as a two shilling (or two bob) &quot;bit&quot; (abbreviation 2/-) worth 24 pence or one-tenth of a pound.

In Ireland, a silver florin coin (worth one-tenth of an Irish pound, with Irish inscription ) was minted between 1928 and 1943; it became cupronickel in 1943 and was withdrawn from use on 1 June 1994.

The Hungarian forint, first introduced in 1325 under King Charles Robert, is named after the florin.

<doc id="252633" wikidata="Q297462" url="?curid=252633" title="Marty Friedman">
<text>(born December 8, 1962) is an American guitarist, best known for his tenure as the lead guitarist of thrash metal band Megadeth from 1990 to 2000. He is also known for playing alongside Jason Becker in Cacophony from 1986 until 1989, as well as his 13 solo albums and tours. Friedman has resided in Tokyo since 2003, where he has appeared on over 700 Japanese television programs such as &quot;Rock Fujiyama&quot;, &quot;Hebimeta-san&quot;, &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; and &quot;Jukebox English&quot;. He has released albums with several record labels, including Avex Trax, Universal, EMI, Prosthetic, and Shrapnel Records.

==Early career (1982–1989)==
Friedman took up the guitar at the age of 14 after attending a KISS concert, and is largely self-taught. He rushed to form a band and started playing original songs, the reason being that originals are easier to play than covers. &quot;Because&quot;, he says, &quot;even if you screw up, you just claim that the song is written like that and no one can challenge you.&quot; The mother of one of Friedman&#x27;s friends ran an event center with a two-level stage, and Friedman and his friends used it as a rehearsal space. Word quickly spread about their band, and, since they were in a rural area, people would come from miles around to socialize and listen to music. Rehearsals soon became live shows. Friedman formed and played lead guitar in several other bands, including Deuce, Hawaii (which had previously been called Vixen), and notably Cacophony. Cacophony featured neoclassical metal elements and synchronized twin guitar harmonies and counterpoints shared with guitarist Jason Becker. He played guitar on the 1989 album &quot;In Your Face&quot; by Christian rock band Shout. In 1988, he recorded demos for Jet Red that eventually were released as bonus tracks on the 2009 Jet Red release &quot;Flight Plan&quot;. In August 1988, he released his first solo album, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

==Megadeth (1990–2000, 2023)==
When Cacophony disbanded in 1989, Friedman auditioned for the thrash metal band Megadeth after a tip from his friend Bob Nalbandian. Friedman officially joined Megadeth in February 1990. Friedman&#x27;s audition can be seen on the Megadeth DVD &quot;Arsenal of Megadeth&quot;. The first album he recorded with them was &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, which was released on September 24, 1990. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1994 and was nominated for the Best Metal Performance Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards.

Friedman further developed his style of playing exotic scale solos from the Cacophony era, and integrated it into the music of Megadeth. In July 1992, Megadeth released &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, which was a more commercial album, aimed at a wider audience, and sold double platinum. Friedman played on Megadeth&#x27;s further releases &quot;Youthanasia&quot; (1994), &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; (1997), and &quot;Risk&quot; (1999). After a total of five studio albums with Megadeth, in December 1999 Friedman announced his departure from Megadeth. His last show with the band was on January 9, 2000, at 4th &amp; B in San Diego.

In his memoir, &quot;Dreaming Japanese&quot;, Friedman discussed experiencing severe panic attacks during his final months with the band. After informing his bandmates of his decision to leave, he began suffering from debilitating anxiety that impacted him both mentally and physically. To cope, he relied on antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and a routine of protein-heavy meals and long hot baths. Despite his condition, Friedman maintained high performance standards on stage, which led to tensions with bandmates and staff who were unaware of the extent of his struggles. Following his departure, he spent months recovering and reflecting on this challenging period.

Friedman later stated that he got tired of &quot;holding the flag&quot; for traditional metal and felt that he could not evolve as a musician. In an interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com in March 2007, Friedman claimed that he wanted Megadeth to move towards a more aggressive sound and that he&#x27;d rather have been playing straight pop music than the pop-influenced metal Megadeth was playing at the time. During Friedman&#x27;s time in the band, they sold over ten million albums worldwide.

During his time in Megadeth, Friedman released three solo albums between 1992 and 1996, which featured Megadeth bandmate Nick Menza on drums.

Friedman reunited with Megadeth for the songs &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; and &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo on February 27, 2023.

Friedman reunited with Megadeth again at Wacken Open Air for the songs &quot;Trust&quot;, &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot;, &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; and &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; on August 4, 2023.

== In Japan and recent work (2000–present) ==
Friedman appeared on the Tourniquet albums &quot;Where Moth and Rust Destroy&quot; (2003) and &quot;Antiseptic Bloodbath&quot; (2012), and Tourniquet drummer Ted Kirkpatrick&#x27;s solo album &quot;Onward to Freedom.&quot;

In 2003, Friedman collaborated with Nanase Aikawa on her third mini album R.U.O.K. In 2021 he toured with Aikawa on her 25th anniversary concert tour.

In 2009, Friedman collaborated with Emma Gelotte and Tinna Karlsdotter from &quot;All Ends&quot; as the lead guitarist for the song &quot;With Me&quot;, which was featured in the game, &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot;. In 2010, Friedman launched a record label under Avex Group, called Gokukara Records.
In February 2010, during C. J. Ramone&#x27;s Japan tour, he made a guest appearance on guitar for &quot;California Sun&quot;, a cover song previously released by The Ramones on their 1977 album, &quot;Leave Home&quot;.

In 2011, Friedman collaborated with Japanese idol group Momoiro Clover Z, providing guitar for their song &quot;Mōretsu Uchū Kōkyōkyoku Dai 7 Gakushō &quot;Mugen no Ai&quot;&quot;, which would become a hit in 2012.

In 2011, Friedman worked with Ayanocozey Show to make the song SAMURAI STRONG STYLE, theme of the Tokusatsu movie &quot;Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Fourze &amp; OOO: Movie War Mega Max&quot;. The catchphrase for the movie is . Friedman and Ayanocozey had previously worked together when they joined the Japanese promotional super-group FANTA, releasing the 2010 single &quot;Fantastic Love&quot;. Friedman stood for the &quot;F&quot; in FANTA, Ayanocozey stood for the first &quot;A&quot;, and the other members of the group made up the other letters.

Friedman recorded with Daniel Tompkins of Tesseract in Tompkins&#x27; band Skyharbor&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blinding White Noise&quot;. At the end of 2012, a full album containing heavy metal covers of Momoiro Clover Z&#x27;s songs was also released by a band named &quot;Metal Clone X&quot;. Although band members remained anonymous, Friedman was cited as label producer and arranger.

In 2013, Friedman released his first library of guitar loops on LoopArtists. Friedman recorded collections of clean-tone, high gain lead and rhythm guitar loops that are intended for use in a production and remix environment. Friedman has been doing concert tours for the &quot;Bravely Default&quot; original soundtrack in 2013 as well as the Budokan concert tours among others. In combination with these tours he has also released his new album &quot;Inferno&quot; in 2014 which he is now touring across Europe going to places such as Norway, Poland, Netherlands and Germany.

In 2014, Friedman collaborated again with Momoiro Clover Z, providing the guitar track for their single &quot;Moon Pride&quot;. The song was also used as the opening theme music for the television series &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, which premiered in July that year.

In 2018, he collaborated with Man with a Mission&#x27;s Jean-Ken Johnny, KenKen, and Kōji Fujimoto for the song &quot;The Perfect World&quot;, which was used as main theme for the Netflix original anime series &quot;B: The Beginning&quot;.

===Television===
Friedman appears on Japanese television and is also a contributing columnist to Japanese music magazines and national newspapers. Speaking Japanese, he became a regular member of the cast of TXN&#x27;s musical TV program &quot;Hebimeta-san&quot; (ヘビメタさん) (anglicized as &quot;Mr. Heavy-Metal&quot;) with Japanese idol Yoko Kumada until the show came to an end in 2005. Friedman had his own heavy metal TV program called &quot;Rock Fujiyama&quot; alongside Shelly, Ken Ayugai (Kenny Guy), Yorimasa Hisatake (Rock Ninja Yorimasa) and ex-Scanch member Rolly Teranishi from April 2006 until March 2007. From November till December 2005, he toured with singer Ami Suzuki on her &quot;Suzuki Ami Around the World&quot; live house tour, which took place in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.
Friedman was featured on &quot;Jukebox&quot;, a television program in which Friedman and two Japanese people translate the lyrics of various English songs into understandable Japanese. He has also made guest appearances on the television programs &quot;Eigo de Shabera Night&quot; and &quot;Tamori Club&quot;.
In 2008, Friedman played the role of Paul Weinberg, an English language teacher, in Isshin Inudou&#x27;s &quot;Gou-Gou Datte Neko de Aru&quot;.

Friedman was a guest star in the Adult Swim original &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; by playing driving teacher Mr. Gojira. He has appeared on Cool Japan several times as a music expert.

In 2009, Friedman appeared on &quot;The Quiz Show&quot;, a Japanese TV drama starring Sho Sakurai as a guest professor. In January 2014, Friedman took part in New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome event, playing Hiroshi Tanahashi to the arena.

In 2024, Friedman performed on &quot;2024最美的夜 bilibili跨年晚会&quot;, a yearly new year&#x27;s celebration show hosted by Chinese streaming platform Bilibili alongside Ichika Nito and Marcin Patrzalek.

==Personal life==
Friedman is of Jewish descent. He lives in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo.

Shortly after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Friedman began auctioning off a great variety of his musical equipment and paraphernalia that he used as a member of Megadeth and Cacophony, including some of the earliest productions of Jackson Kelly guitars and his signature Carvin V220.

In December 2012, Friedman married Japanese cellist Hiyori Okuda in Yokohama.

In 2018, Friedman confirmed that his hair is genuinely curly but hates it; he prefers to have it straight.

==Guitar technique==

Friedman is known for his improvisation and for fusing Eastern music with Western music and other styles, such as neoclassical, thrash metal and later progressive rock. When playing, he often uses arpeggiated chords and various customized scales and arpeggios, some of which relate to Asian (Chinese and Japanese), Middle Eastern and other exotic scales, which are different from the typical minor/major pentatonic and seven modes based on the Major scale.

As a right-handed guitarist, Friedman has an unorthodox picking technique; the angle in which his hand is clenched goes against the conventional palm mute frequently used by right-handed players in metal music. He also frequently utilizes upstrokes as opposed to downstrokes, especially on the B and high E strings. Rather than strictly picking from his elbow or wrist, Friedman will also pick moving his fingers—a technique known as &quot;circle picking&quot;.

Friedman is critical of being called a shredder. He opined that the term is &quot;a guy who plays fast meaningless shit all the time. Shredders are the guys in your friend&#x27;s basement who play insanely fast, and it just looks so mind-blowing and amazingly cool with their fingers flying all around the neck, but if you close your eyes and actually listen, what you hear is a pile of shit. You all know what I&#x27;m talking about.&quot;

<text>Daleside Brewery is an independent brewery founded in 1988 by Bill Witty. Its headquarters are located in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England.

In March 2024, it was reported that the company had been acquired by Rooster&#x27;s Brewery.

==History==
Three years after his father founded the company, Craig Witty became head brewer in 1991. When Billy died in 2007, his son took over running Daleside Brewery and continues to be a driving force behind the popular English microbrewery.

Established in Hurrogate, the firm moved to Starbeck in 1992 and went through periods of enlargement up until 1999. It has won numerous awards for its ales, including its Morocco Ale.

===Morocco Ale===
The 17th-century recipe for this ale, which had been brewed especially for Charles II of England and named after his wife, Catherine of Braganza, who was described as being &quot;Moorish&quot;, was rediscovered in the early 1990s after being lost and was given to Daleside under special licence. Morocco Ale is specially brewed for Levens Hall in Cumbria, who are the owners of the secret recipe.

==Products==
Daleside produce a wide range of beers including;
*Morocco Ale, a traditional spiced beer based on an Elizabethan recipe
*Old Legover, a low abv Old Ale 
*Monkey Wrench, a stronger Old Ale (CAMRA award-winning) which was brewed especially for a beer festival in Hartlepool (so named after the colloquial nickname for people from Hartlepool who are known as Monkey hangers)
*Ripon Jewel, a strong pale ale, commissioned by Ripon Cathedral in honour of a gemstone associated with the founding of the cathedral. Brewed since 1999; a percentage of the profits go to the cathedrals maintenance fund.
*Chocolate Stout, a stout where the barley is heavily roasted and Nestlé chocolate is added
*Duff, a 5% abv dark ale (&#x27;Duff&#x27; sounds like &#x27;dubh&#x27; Gaelic for &quot;Dark&quot;)
*Crack Shot Ale, named in honour of Jane Ingilby who supposedly dressed as a man and fought at the Battle of Marston Moor, later standing guard over Oliver Cromwell when he hid in Ripley Castle overnight after the battle
*EU in, a golden fruity ale
*EU out, a light hoppy ale (both of these were brewed in spring 2016 during the EU Referendum campaign in the United Kingdom)
*Greengrass, named after the curmudgeonly character Claude Jeremiah Greengrass from the TV show &quot;Heartbeat&quot;

==Sponsorship==
Daleside Brewery sponsor the annual Auld Lang Syne fell race in Haworth every New Year&#x27;s Eve.

<text>The diabolo ( ; commonly misspelled &quot;diablo&quot;) is a juggling or circus prop consisting of an axle () and two cups (hourglass/egg timer shaped) or discs derived from the Chinese yo-yo. This object is spun using a string attached to two hand sticks (&quot;batons&quot; or &quot;wands&quot;). A large variety of tricks is possible with the diabolo, including tosses, and various types of interaction with the sticks, string, and various parts of the user&#x27;s body. Multiple diabolos can be spun on a single string.

Like the Western yo-yo (which has an independent origin), it maintains its spinning motion through a rotating effect based on conservation of angular momentum.

== History ==
===Origin===

The Diabolo is derived from the Chinese yo-yo encountered by Europeans during the colonial era. However, the origin of the Chinese yo-yo is unknown. The earliest mention of the Chinese yo-yo is in the late Ming dynasty Wanli period (1572–1620), with its details well recorded in the book &quot;Dijing Jingwulue&quot; by the Liu Tong. The book refers to Chinese yo-yos as &quot;kong zhong&quot; ().

Diabolos are made of different materials and come in different sizes and weights.

There are many names in the Chinese language for the Chinese yo-yo:

===Spread to the West===
The first known mention of a diabolo in the Western world was made by a missionary, Father Amiot, in Beijing in 1792 during Lord Macartney&#x27;s ambassadorship, after which examples were brought to Europe, as was the sheng (eventually adapted to the harmonica and accordion). Amiot described it as follows:

It consists of two hollow cylinders of metal, wood, or bamboo, joined together in the middle by a cross-piece. Each of the cylinders is pierced by a hole in opposite directions. The rope loops around the crossbeam. By holding this rattle in the air, and moving it with speed, a rapid current of air is established in each of the portions of the cylinder, and a snoring is heard, similar to that produced by the German spinning top. 


The diabolo was part of a presentation of Chinese culture edited by stenographer in 1811-2 (&quot;La Chine en miniature&quot;). The toy&#x27;s popularity waxed and waned throughout the 19th century. In 1812 the diabolo &quot;was all the rage&quot;; then it &quot;enjoyed an ephemeral vogue&quot; until it &quot;finally fell into discredit&quot; some time before 1861. Some consider the toy dangerous; injuries and deaths of players and bystanders have been claimed; and Préfet de Police Louis Lépine once outlawed the game in the streets of Paris.

The name &quot;diabolo&quot; was coined by Belgian engineer Gustave Philippart, who developed the modern diabolo in the early twentieth century, although credit has also been given to Charles Burgess Fry (&quot;The Outdoor Magazine&quot; in 1906) or Fry and Philippart. The ODE gives the term&#x27;s origin as from ecclesiastical Latin &quot;diabolus&quot; (devil) via Italian, reflecting the older name, &quot;The devil on two sticks&quot;.

Strong derives the name from the Greek &quot;dia bolo&quot;, roughly meaning &#x27;across throw&#x27;: &quot;In Greek, the term &#x27;diaballo&#x27;, means to throw across. It comes from a combination of &#x27;dia&#x27; meaning across or through (as in the meter of a circle, a line that crosses circle), and &#x27;bolla&#x27; or originally &#x27;ballo&#x27; which means to throw...&quot; However, Philippart&#x27;s intention is clear in his 1905 patent, where he gives it the alternative French name &quot;Diable&quot;, &quot;Devil&quot;. The term &quot;loriot&quot; was also used in England early in the twentieth century, as well as &quot;rocket-ball&quot;. The earlier name &quot;The devil on two sticks&quot; is sometimes still seen, although nowadays this more often refers to another circus-based skill toy, the devil stick: &quot;In time &#x27;diabolo&#x27; was retained for the spinning version of the Chinese stick toy while the hitting version of the stick toy was rendered into English as the Devil Stick.&quot;

Philippart claimed &quot;Diabolo&quot; to be his invention. In reality, he had improved a Napoleonic toy, which in turn had originated long ago in China.&quot; However, Charles Parker acquired the U.S. license for the term &quot;diabolo&quot; in 1906, and the fad for the toy lasted until 1910 (caricatures of public figures with the toy made it to newspapers), when it was hurt greatly by a glut of unsold poor quality off-brand versions (costs ranged from one to eight dollars). The toy was even removed from the Parker Brothers catalogue, a rare occurrence (its two-year return in 1929 also failed). 

An earlier occurrence of the fad, in Paris, is mentioned in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1893. The Wright brothers became enamored with the toy during a lull in a trip to France they had taken to market their Wright Flyer III airplane.

The diabolo’s temporary fall from favour was commented on by the narrator of Marcel Proust’s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;:
One morning … I was taking a short walk with Albertine, whom I had found on the beach tossing up and catching again at the end of a string a weird object which gave her a look of Giotto’s &quot;Idolatry&quot;; it was called, as it happened, a ‘diabolo’, and has so fallen into disuse now that, when they come upon a picture of a girl playing with one, the commentators of future generations will solemnly discuss, as it might be in front of the allegorical figures in the Arena Chapel, what it is that she is holding.

==Design==
A diabolo is described as &quot;a double-coned bobbin that [is] twirled, tossed, and caught on a string secured by two wands, one held in each hand,&quot; and, more generally, as &quot;an object that can be suspended on a string made taut by two held sticks&quot;. The Chinese yo-yo, often considered a type of diabolo, has been described as &quot;a short round wooden stick with two round disks, 1.5 cm thick with a space between them, attached on either end of the stick...It will rotate on a string, each end tied to a thin stick,&quot; and as &quot;two hollow discs of light wood, with openings in the sides, united by a peg tapering to its center&quot;.

As with the yo-yo, the design of the diabolo has varied through history and across the world. Chinese diabolos have been made of bamboo. Wooden diabolos were common in Victorian times in Britain. Rubber diabolos were first patented by Gustave Philippart in 1905. In the late twentieth century a rubberised plastic material was first used. Metal has also been used, especially for fire diabolos. &quot;Parker Brothers used steel for the bobbins [axles], with molded rubber ends, and also made some versions out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its &#x27;frictionless&#x27; properties, spun even faster than steel.&quot; Holes and metal strips alter the sound of the spinning diabolo, but create friction.

The size and weight of diabolos varies. Diabolos with more weight tend to retain their momentum for longer, whereas small, light diabolos can be thrown higher and are easier to accelerate to high speeds. Rubber diabolos are less prone to breakage but are more prone to deformations. More commonly used are plastic-rubber hybrids that allow flex but hold their shape. The size of the disc or cone varies, as do the presence and size of holes in the discs or cones which may alter the sound produced. In yo-yos a cone is known as the butterfly shape. Regardless of the presence, size, and shape, &quot;once a diabolo is spinning, the friction of the spinning diabolo against the string creates a whining sound; this is called &#x27;making the diabolo sing.&#x27;&quot; &quot;When played hard, the [Chinese] yoyo will give out a sharp shrill sound...The shrill sound would add an exciting atmosphere to the [Shanghai winter] festivals...A skillful player can use a pot cover [with a round handle] as a yoyo [without sound].&quot; A fast whirling kouen-gen produces &quot;a shrill whistling sound...not unlike the note of the steam siren&quot;. Diabolos with only one cup (&quot;monobolos&quot;) are also used.

The axle can be either a fixed axle or a bearing axle. The former does not spin, while the latter variety spins in one direction. Noticeable differences between the two include friction involved, the amount of time the diabolo can spin for, and tension. There are also certain tricks that are only possible with one type of axle.

== Basic principles ==
The most basic act of diabolo manipulation is to spin it on the string. &quot;The string is placed between the circles, but in order for the diabolo to balance, it must maintain a spinning motion, much like a yo-yo.&quot; However, &quot;considerably more skill is needed to twirl a diabolo...than the Yo-yo it resembles.&quot; &quot;Diabolo requires hard practice and highly developed skills&quot;

Typically, the player pulls the stick in his or her dominant hand so that the string moves along the axle, turning it. &quot;The player...swing[s] the string right and left.&quot; By doing this repeatedly and rapidly the diabolo rotates faster. The diabolo spin can be accelerated more quickly using various methods: the &#x27;whip&#x27; rotates the diabolo faster by moving one handstick in front of the user&#x27;s body and past the other handstick, the &#x27;wrap&#x27; rotates the diabolo faster when the user wraps a loop of the string around the axle. Both methods increase the amount of string contact with the axle in any given time.

Once spin speed is increased to a sufficient level that the diabolo is stable, the user can then perform tricks. &quot;Skillful players can set it whirling at a rate of 2,000 revolutions a minute, it is said.&quot; Depending on how long a trick takes to perform, the user will normally have to spend some time increasing the spin speed of the diabolo before performing other tricks. Skilled users can perform multiple tricks while maintaining the spin speed of the diabolo. &quot;A skilled person [can] catch it, hurl it fifty or sixty feet into the air, then catch it again with little effort.&quot;

== Tricks and styles ==

=== Fundamental tricks ===

=== Advanced tricks ===
There are countless tricks and variations that fall outside the above categories; these are often more difficult and form the cutting edge of modern diabolo routines. Some examples are:

=== Multiple diabolos ===
Perhaps the most active area of development for diabolo performance involves tricks with more than one diabolo on a single string. When manipulating multiple diabolos &quot;low&quot;, the diabolos orbit continuously on the string in a &quot;shuffle&quot;. Shuffles are either synchronous (commonly referred to as &quot;sync&quot;) or asynchronous (&quot;async&quot;), depending on whether the diaboloist&#x27;s hands&#x27; movements occur simultaneously or not; shuffles may also be performed with only one hand.

Juggling multiple diabolos &quot;high&quot; involves continuously catching and throwing a number of diabolos, never with more than one diabolo on the string simultaneously. Diaboloists have pushed the number of diabolos juggled at once up to six &quot;high&quot; (although there is some controversy as to whether this counts as the number of catches achieved is so small) and five &quot;low&quot;. Most diaboloists, however, stick to using only two or three diabolos at once. The introduction of multiple diabolos on a single string allows for many new moves. Many are applications of one-diabolo moves to multiple diabolos.

=== Vertax ===
Another advanced diabolo style is &quot;vertax&quot; (vertical axis; also known as &quot;Excalibur&quot;). This is where the diabolo is &quot;turned vertically&quot; by means of &quot;whipping&quot; and is continually spun in this upright state. The person spinning it needs to rotate their body to keep up with the constant whipping action due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax; this feat has been achieved by a small number of diaboloists. It has also been done in the form of a fan. Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC. Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first &#x27;infinite suicide vertax&#x27;), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups. Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques. Finally, Alexis Levillon invented many vertax tricks including vertax integrals, furthered multidiabolo vertax, and has also invented the &quot;Galexis&quot; style, where one diabolo is horizontal, while the other is in vertax.

=== Contact diabolo ===
This is a relatively recent style of diabolo that is gaining popularity. It utilizes the diabolo so that it has little or no spin at all. Then it can be caught and passed and manipulated with different parts of the body instead of just the sticks and string. It has new possibilities and new ideas are arising from this. Examples include catching the diabolo between one&#x27;s arm and the stick before throwing it back. Tricks with multiple diabolos have also been developed.
=== Loop diabolo ===
Instead of having two sticks connected by a string, the diabolo is manipulated on a loop of string held around the hands. This opens up a variety of new tricks. Yo-yo type slack tricks can also be performed in a loop.

=== Monobolo ===
Monobolo is a variation of the diabolo where instead of having two diabolo cups, there is only one and a weight on the other side. The monobolo can be used in the same fashion as normal diabolos. However, if a monobolo is put into excalibur, or horizontally, monobolos can be manipulated to be like a spinning top. To start a monobolo, twist the string around the axle and then let it gain some speed.

== Performances ==
Cirque du Soleil has combined diabolos with acrobatics during feature acts in five shows: &quot;Quidam&quot;, &quot;La Nouba&quot;, &quot;Dralion&quot;, &quot;Ovo&quot; &quot;and Viva Elvis.&quot;

In 2006 Circus Smirkus presented a duo diabolo act starring Jacob and Nate Sharpe, with advanced tricks including the first double sprinkler pass in a performance as well as some five-diabolo passing.

The diabolo programs of many Chinese schools provide performances during the Chinese New Year or near the end of the school year.

<doc id="252658" wikidata="Q158874" url="?curid=252658" title="Carlos I of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Carlos I (; ; 28 September 1863 – 1 February 1908), known as the Diplomat (), the Martyr (), and the Oceanographer (), among many other names, was King of Portugal from 1889 until his assassination in 1908. He was the first Portuguese king to die a violent death since King Sebastian in 1578.

==Early life==

Carlos was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the son of King Luís and Queen Maria Pia, daughter of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, and was a member of the House of Braganza. He had a brother, Infante Afonso, Duke of Porto. He was baptised with the names &quot;Carlos Fernando Luís Maria Víctor Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier Francisco de Assis José Simão&quot;.

He had an intense education and was prepared to rule as a constitutional monarch. In 1883, he traveled to Italy, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, where he increased his knowledge of the modern civilization of his time. In 1883, 1886 and 1888, he ruled as Regent as his father was traveling in Europe, as had become traditional among the Portuguese constitutional kings. His father Luis I advised him to be modest and to study with focus.

His first bridal candidate was one of the daughters of German Emperor Frederick III, but the issue of religion presented an insurmountable problem, and diplomatic pressure from the British government prevented the marriage. He then met and married Princess Amélie of Orléans, eldest daughter of Philippe, comte de Paris, pretender to the throne of France.

==Reign==

Carlos became king on 19 October 1889. After the 1890 British Ultimatum, a series of treaties were signed with the United Kingdom. One signed in August 1890 defined colonial borders along the Zambezi and Congo rivers, whereas another signed on 14 October 1899 confirmed colonial treaties dating back to the 17th century. These treaties stabilised the political balance in Africa, ending Portuguese claims of sovereignty on the Pink Map, a geographical conception of how Portuguese colonies would appear on a map if the territory between the coastal colonies of Angola and Mozambique could be connected with territory in central Africa. These central African territories became part of the British Empire with the Portuguese concession becoming a source of national resentment in the country.

Domestically, Portugal declared bankruptcy twice – on 14 June 1892, then again on 10 May 1902 – causing industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism and press criticism of the monarchy. Carlos responded by appointing João Franco as prime minister and subsequently accepting parliament&#x27;s dissolution.

As a patron of science and the arts, King Carlos took an active part in the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1894. The following year he decorated the Portuguese poet João de Deus in a ceremony in Lisbon.

Carlos took a personal interest in deep-sea and maritime exploration and used several yachts named &quot;Amélia&quot; on his oceanographical voyages. He published an account of his own studies in this area.

==Assassination==
On 1 February 1908, the royal family was returning to Lisbon from the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa in Alentejo, where they had spent part of the hunting season during the winter. The royal party traveled by train to Barreiro, from there taking a steamer to cross the Tagus River and disembarking at Cais do Sodré in central Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the open carriage containing Carlos I and his family passed through the Terreiro do Paço fronting on the river. In spite of recent political unrest there was no military escort, except for a single mounted officer
riding by the carriage. While the carriage was crossing the square at dusk, shots were fired from amongst the sparse crowd by two republican activists, Alfredo Luís da Costa and Manuel Buíça.

Buíça, a former army sergeant and sharpshooter, fired five shots from a rifle hidden under his long overcoat. The king died immediately, his heir Luís Filipe was mortally wounded, and Prince Manuel was hit in the arm. The queen escaped injury. The two assassins were killed on the spot by police, and an innocent bystander, João da Costa, was also shot dead in the confusion. The royal carriage turned into the nearby Navy Arsenal, where, about twenty minutes later, Prince Luís Filipe died. Several days later, the younger son, Prince Manuel, was proclaimed king of Portugal. He was the last of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty and the final king of Portugal.

==Marriage and children==

Carlos I was married to Princess Amélie of Orléans on 22 May 1886. She was the daughter of Philippe, Count of Paris, and Princess Marie Isabelle of Orléans. They had three children:
* Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal (21 March 1887 – 1 February 1908)
* Infanta Maria Ana of Braganza (b/d 14 December 1887)
* Manuel II, King of Portugal between 1908 and 1910 (15 November 1889 – 2 July 1932)

Allegedly, Carlos I had several extramarital relationships, from which some bastards were born. He may have had a daughter from an American. By Grimaneza Viana de Lima, a Peruvian widow of a Brazilian diplomat, he possibly had a daughter called Maria Pia, born before 1902. Grimaneza was his last great passion. Allegedly, he also had, from the Brazilian Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça, another bastard daughter, born in 1907 and also called Maria Pia. During his life, Carlos I never officially recognized the paternity of any bastard child, despite the fact that he himself was responsible for fueling suspicions about his illegitimate offspring.

<doc id="252669" wikidata="Q7944876" url="?curid=252669" title="Völkner incident">
<text>The Völkner incident describes the execution of the German-born Protestant missionary Carl Sylvius Völkner in New Zealand in 1865 by an independent Māori judiciary, consisting of members of the Pai Mārire faith. It has come to be seen by historians as a major and consequential miscarriage of justice by the Government of New Zealand during the New Zealand Wars. The event led to the arrest and execution of several major chieftains, and the confiscation of 85,000 acres of Māori land.

Born in the Electorate of Hesse, Völkner&#x27;s mission took him to the lands of Te Whakatōhea at the behest of their chieftain, Mokomoko, initially an ally, who patronised him. With Whakatōhea support and guidance he established a church in Ōpōtiki in the Auckland Province (present-day Bay of Plenty). Völkner fell out with Te Whakatōhea after the Invasion of the Waikato, after which point many converted to the nascent Pai Mārire religion. Völkner was soon suspected of spying for the Crown by his former beneficiaries.

Despite hostilities Völkner had remained at Ōpōtiki, making several visits to Auckland in 1864, and again in January 1865. This further aroused suspicion that he was reporting to Governor George Grey on Whakatōhea activities without their approval. Ignoring warnings from several locals, he returned to Ōpōtiki on 1 March. Völkner was arrested almost immediately and tried on charges of espionage by Whakatōhea members of the Pai Mārire. Völkner was found guilty after a night of deliberation, and, sentenced to death, was hanged and decapitated at his church grounds.

In response to Völkner&#x27;s death, George Grey authorised a military expedition to Ōpōtiki to arrest those who had convicted and executed him. Between 16 and 58 people were killed in the attack, which took place on 11 September 1865, and the pā was burnt to the ground. A number of local people were arrested and some were executed without trial. A large parcel of land, from Matatā to east of Ōpōtiki, was confiscated from eastern Bay of Plenty iwi. Despite being uninvolved in Völkner’s death, Mokomoko was arrested after Ōpōtiki Pā was looted and burnt to the ground by colonial forces. He surrendered to them on the condition that his tribe be left alone, but was wrongfully convicted for the crime, and executed among with several others in Auckland in May 1866.

==Background==
The Battle of Te Ranga, on 21 June 1864, was the last major conflict of the Tauranga Campaign and is said to mark the effective end of the fighting involved with the Invasion of the Waikato. It left an uneasy peace – not so much a peace as an absence of conflict, one that lasted for several months. This period saw two significant changes in disposition of the warring parties.

The Pai Marire (or Hauhau) movement, a syncretic religious group, was gaining ground and converts among the East Coast Māori. Pai Mārire began in 1862 as a combination of Christianity and traditional Māori beliefs. Originally peaceful, a sub-branch known as Hauhau became violent after experiencing Christian hypocrisy.

Meanwhile, the Imperial Troops were fighting their last campaign in New Zealand before being withdrawn to garrison duty and then complete withdrawal from New Zealand. At the same time the Colonial Militia were being reorganised and rearmed to take up the slack.

==Völkner&#x27;s trial and execution==

Among the Māori community, Völkner was rumoured to be a government spy. It was thought he sent Governor George Grey a plan of a pa near Te Awamutu where British troops burned women and children alive in a whare that had been converted to a church. The wife and two daughters of Kereopa were among the victims. Pai Mārire (or Hauhau) arrived in the Ōpōtiki area of the Bay of Plenty in February 1865. On 2 March Protestant missionary Carl Völkner discovered that his Māori congregation had moved on from Christianity to Pai Mārire (or Hauhau). Like many Europeans in isolated communities, Völkner had sent reports of anti-Government activity to the governor. Although warned to stay away from the town, on his next visit he was captured, put on trial and hanged from a tree, and his body was decapitated an hour later. Kereopa Te Rau, a Hauhau, was alleged to have re-entered the church and conducted a service with Völkner&#x27;s head in the pulpit beside him. He was also alleged to have plucked out the dead missionary&#x27;s eyes and swallowed them. One eye allegedly represented Parliament and the other the Queen and British law. News of the murder caused great alarm and anger among Pākehā.

==Response==
For several months nothing happened—then came the capture of Weraroa Pa—the relief of the siege of Pipiriki in August 1865 that virtually ended that phase of the Second Taranaki War. This freed up the militia for action elsewhere.

George Grey was enraged upon hearing of the execution. He proclaimed its perpetrators “fanatics” and in September 1965 declared martial law in the Bay of Plenty, ordering Ōpōtiki locals to assist government forces or face land confiscation. Then forces then available to the New Zealand government, some 500 men, were transported by &quot;HMS Eclipse&quot; from Wanganui through Cook Strait, around the East Cape to Ōpōtiki. The composition of this force was significant. There were four companies of militia, a troop of cavalry and a contingent of Ngāti Hau warriors led by Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui. These were the units that had already been campaigning together during the Taranaki War and had a history of successful cooperation and mutual respect.

The landing at Ōpōtiki was accomplished with difficulty. One of the ships ran aground on a falling tide and came under fire from the shore. Eventually it had to be abandoned and the crew and militia waded ashore but it was another twenty-four hours before the other ships were able to land their men and supplies. Once Grey&#x27;s men had made successful landfall at Ōpōtiki, they opened fire indiscriminately at the local inhabitants, forcing them to retreat into nearby forest. Rather than pursue them, the Crown troops looted the pā, before burning it to the ground.

As soon as they were established and the snipers driven away, the militia occupied the church where Völkner had been murdered. While some of the Pākehā soldiers worked at turning this into a fortress, the others with Keepa and the Ngāti Hau were turned loose on the countryside. They employed the military tactic of denying the enemy food supplies, keeping what they needed and destroying the rest. Beyond a few muskets the East Coast Hauhau lacked many modern weapons with which to defend themselves. This accounts for the numerous one-sided battles and the Hauhau resorting to attempted treachery to defeat the government forces. It was made clear to them that these depredations would continue until the men responsible for the murder of Völkner were captured or surrendered. But the man they wanted most, Kereopa, had retreated to Tuhoe lands in the Urewera mountains and had no intention of surrendering.

Mokomoko, unaware he was the prime suspect behind the orchestration of Völkner’s death, surrendered in Ōpōtiki on condition that no punishment be inflicted upon Te Whakatōhea. Instead, he and four other men were arrested for murder and tried in Auckland. The rope used to hang Völkner was deemed sufficient evidence for the five men to be sentenced to death. Mokomoko and the other men were executed in Mount Eden Prison on 17 May 1866.

Before he was hanged, Mokomoko said “Tangohia mai te taura i taku kakī kia waiata au i taku waiata” (&quot;Take the rope from my neck that I may sing my song”). He then sang:

==Aftermath==
After Mokomoko’s execution, large areas of land around Ōpōtiki were confiscated under the &quot;New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863&quot; and sold to settlers.

In the early 1870s, the Ureweras were invaded by the government forces searching for Te Kooti and the Tuhoe were effectively conquered and subdued. They were forced to yield Kereopa to Ropata Wahawaha, and he was tried and hanged for Völkner&#x27;s murder on 5 January 1872. Some Crown witnesses in the trial were given immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony, and Kereopa had no defence witnesses because the Crown would not pay for their travel from Napier. The jury took only about 15 minutes to return their verdict. Kereopa&#x27;s iwi Ngati Rangiwewehi say that the trial had a predetermined outcome and was a miscarriage of justice.

In 1993, Justice Minister Doug Graham delivered an apology to Te Whakatōhea along with an official pardon of Mokomoko, one of the chiefs hanged. In 1996, the New Zealand Government signed a Deed of Settlement, acknowledging and apologising for the wrongful invasion and confiscation of Te Whakatōhea lands, and the subsequent economic, cultural and developmental devastation suffered by the iwi. In 1998 the New Zealand government offered the Whakatōhea iwi NZ$40 million as compensation for all their historical claims including the invasion and the confiscation of land following the Völkner Incident; however the offer was not accepted. Te Whakatōhea are presently preparing to negotiate a full settlement with the New Zealand Government. As part of the settlement of neighbouring iwi Ngāti Awa&#x27;s claims in 2003, the Völkner Rocks near Whakaari/White Island were renamed &quot;Te Paepae Aotea (Völkner Rocks)&quot;.

Kereopa was posthumously pardoned in November 2014. This means that Kereopa is no longer guilty of the murder of Völkner. This pardon was part of the Ngāti Rangiwewehi Treaty of Waitangi settlement.

<doc id="252670" wikidata="Q332504" url="?curid=252670" title="Absolute continuity">
<text>In calculus and real analysis, absolute continuity is a smoothness property of functions that is stronger than continuity and uniform continuity. The notion of absolute continuity allows one to obtain generalizations of the relationship between the two central operations of calculus—differentiation and integration. This relationship is commonly characterized (by the fundamental theorem of calculus) in the framework of Riemann integration, but with absolute continuity it may be formulated in terms of Lebesgue integration. For real-valued functions on the real line, two interrelated notions appear: absolute continuity of functions and absolute continuity of measures. These two notions are generalized in different directions. The usual derivative of a function is related to the &quot;Radon–Nikodym derivative&quot;, or &quot;density&quot;, of a measure. We have the following chains of inclusions for functions over a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line:

: &quot;absolutely continuous&quot; ⊆ &quot;uniformly continuous&quot; formula_1 &quot;continuous&quot;

and, for a compact interval,

: &quot;continuously differentiable&quot; ⊆ &quot;Lipschitz continuous&quot; ⊆ &quot;absolutely continuous&quot; ⊆ &quot;bounded variation&quot; ⊆ &quot;differentiable almost everywhere&quot;.

==Absolute continuity of functions==

A continuous function fails to be absolutely continuous if it fails to be uniformly continuous, which can happen if the domain of the function is not compact – examples are tan(&quot;x&quot;) over , &quot;x&quot;2 over the entire real line, and sin(1/&quot;x&quot;) over (0, 1]. But a continuous function &quot;f&quot; can fail to be absolutely continuous even on a compact interval. It may not be &quot;differentiable almost everywhere&quot; (like the Weierstrass function, which is not differentiable anywhere). Or it may be differentiable almost everywhere and its derivative &quot;f&quot; ′ may be Lebesgue integrable, but the integral of &quot;f&quot; ′ differs from the increment of &quot;f&quot; (how much &quot;f&quot; changes over an interval). This happens for example with the Cantor function.

===Definition===
Let formula_2 be an interval in the real line formula_3. A function formula_4 is absolutely continuous on formula_2 if for every positive number formula_6, there is a positive number formula_7 such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals formula_8 of formula_2 with formula_10 satisfies
:formula_11
then
:formula_12

The collection of all absolutely continuous functions on formula_2 is denoted formula_14.

===Equivalent definitions===

The following conditions on a real-valued function &quot;f&quot; on a compact interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] are equivalent:

# &quot;f&quot; is absolutely continuous;
# &quot;f&quot; has a derivative &quot;f&quot; ′ almost everywhere, the derivative is Lebesgue integrable, and formula_15 for all &quot;x&quot; on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;];
# there exists a Lebesgue integrable function &quot;g&quot; on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] such that formula_16 for all &quot;x&quot; in [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;].

If these equivalent conditions are satisfied, then necessarily any function &quot;g&quot; as in condition 3. satisfies &quot;g&quot; = &quot;f&quot; ′ almost everywhere.

Equivalence between (1) and (3) is known as the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integral calculus, due to Lebesgue.

For an equivalent definition in terms of measures see the section Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity.

===Properties===
* The sum and difference of two absolutely continuous functions are also absolutely continuous. If the two functions are defined on a bounded closed interval, then their product is also absolutely continuous.
* If an absolutely continuous function is defined on a bounded closed interval and is nowhere zero then its reciprocal is absolutely continuous.
* Every absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous and, therefore, continuous. Every (globally) Lipschitz-continuous function is absolutely continuous.
* If &quot;f&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] → R is absolutely continuous, then it is of bounded variation on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;].
* If &quot;f&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] → R is absolutely continuous, then it can be written as the difference of two monotonic nondecreasing absolutely continuous functions on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;].
* If &quot;f&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] → R is absolutely continuous, then it has the Luzin &quot;N&quot; property (that is, for any formula_17 such that formula_18, it holds that formula_19, where formula_20 stands for the Lebesgue measure on R).
* &quot;f&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → R is absolutely continuous if and only if it is continuous, is of bounded variation and has the Luzin &quot;N&quot; property. This statement is also known as the Banach-Zareckiǐ theorem.
* If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → R is absolutely continuous and &quot;g&quot;: R → R is globally Lipschitz-continuous, then the composition &quot;g ∘ f&quot; is absolutely continuous. Conversely, for every function &quot;g&quot; that is not globally Lipschitz continuous there exists an absolutely continuous function &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;g ∘ f&quot; is not absolutely continuous.

===Examples===
The following functions are uniformly continuous but not absolutely continuous:
* The Cantor function on [0, 1] (it is of bounded variation but not absolutely continuous);
* The function:formula_21 on a finite interval containing the origin.

The following functions are absolutely continuous but not α-Hölder continuous:
* The function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;xβ&quot; on [0, &quot;c&quot;], for any 

The following functions are absolutely continuous and α-Hölder continuous but not Lipschitz continuous:
* The function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) =  on [0, &quot;c&quot;], for &quot;α&quot; ≤ 1/2.

===Generalizations===
Let (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) be a metric space and let &quot;I&quot; be an interval in the real line R. A function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is absolutely continuous on &quot;I&quot; if for every positive number formula_6, there is a positive number formula_7 such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals [&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot;] of &quot;I&quot; satisfies:

:formula_24

then:

:formula_25

The collection of all absolutely continuous functions from &quot;I&quot; into &quot;X&quot; is denoted AC(&quot;I&quot;; &quot;X&quot;).

A further generalization is the space AC&quot;p&quot;(&quot;I&quot;; &quot;X&quot;) of curves &quot;f&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that:

:formula_26

for some &quot;m&quot; in the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; space &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;(I).

===Properties of these generalizations===
* Every absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous and, therefore, continuous. Every Lipschitz-continuous function is absolutely continuous.
* If &quot;f&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] → &quot;X&quot; is absolutely continuous, then it is of bounded variation on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;].
* For &quot;f&quot; ∈ AC&quot;p&quot;(&quot;I&quot;; &quot;X&quot;), the metric derivative of &quot;f&quot; exists for &quot;λ&quot;-almost all times in &quot;I&quot;, and the metric derivative is the smallest &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;I&quot;; R) such that:formula_27

==Absolute continuity of measures==

===Definition===
A measure formula_28 on Borel subsets of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure formula_20 if for every formula_20-measurable set formula_31 formula_32 implies formula_33. Equivalently, formula_34 implies formula_35. This condition is written as formula_36 We say formula_28 is &quot;dominated&quot; by formula_38

In most applications, if a measure on the real line is simply said to be absolutely continuous — without specifying with respect to which other measure it is absolutely continuous — then absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure is meant.

The same principle holds for measures on Borel subsets of formula_39

===Equivalent definitions===
The following conditions on a finite measure formula_28 on Borel subsets of the real line are equivalent:

# formula_28 is absolutely continuous;
# For every positive number formula_6 there is a positive number formula_43 such that formula_44 for all Borel sets formula_45 of Lebesgue measure less than formula_46
# There exists a Lebesgue integrable function formula_47 on the real line such that: formula_48 for all Borel subsets formula_45 of the real line.

For an equivalent definition in terms of functions see the section Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity.

Any other function satisfying (3) is equal to formula_47 almost everywhere. Such a function is called Radon–Nikodym derivative, or density, of the absolutely continuous measure formula_51

Equivalence between (1), (2) and (3) holds also in formula_52 for all formula_53

Thus, the absolutely continuous measures on formula_52 are precisely those that have densities; as a special case, the absolutely continuous probability measures are precisely the ones that have probability density functions.

===Generalizations===
If formula_28 and formula_56 are two measures on the same measurable space formula_57 formula_28 is said to be with respect to formula_56 if formula_33 for every set formula_45 for which formula_62 This is written as &quot;formula_63&quot;. That is:
formula_64

When formula_65 then formula_56 is said to be formula_51

Absolute continuity of measures is reflexive and transitive, but is not antisymmetric, so it is a preorder rather than a partial order. Instead, if formula_68 and formula_69 the measures formula_28 and formula_56 are said to be equivalent. Thus absolute continuity induces a partial ordering of such equivalence classes.

If formula_28 is a signed or complex measure, it is said that formula_28 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_56 if its variation formula_75 satisfies formula_76 equivalently, if every set formula_45 for which formula_78 is formula_28-null.

The Radon–Nikodym theorem states that if formula_28 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_81 and both measures are σ-finite, then formula_28 has a density, or &quot;Radon-Nikodym derivative&quot;, with respect to formula_81 which means that there exists a formula_56-measurable function formula_85 taking values in formula_86 denoted by formula_87 such that for any formula_56-measurable set formula_45 we have:
formula_90

===Singular measures===
Via Lebesgue&#x27;s decomposition theorem, every σ-finite measure can be decomposed into the sum of an absolutely continuous measure and a singular measure with respect to another σ-finite measure. See singular measure for examples of measures that are not absolutely continuous.

==Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity==
A finite measure &quot;μ&quot; on Borel subsets of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure if and only if the point function:
:formula_91
is an absolutely continuous real function. More generally, a function is locally (meaning on every bounded interval) absolutely continuous if and only if its distributional derivative is a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

If absolute continuity holds then the Radon–Nikodym derivative of &quot;μ&quot; is equal almost everywhere to the derivative of &quot;F&quot;.

More generally, the measure &quot;μ&quot; is assumed to be locally finite (rather than finite) and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is defined as &quot;μ&quot;((0,&quot;x&quot;]) for , 0 for , and −&quot;μ&quot;((&quot;x&quot;,0]) for . In this case &quot;μ&quot; is the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure generated by &quot;F&quot;. The relation between the two notions of absolute continuity still holds.

<text>The Mikoyan MiG-31 (; NATO reporting name: Foxhound) is a supersonic interceptor aircraft developed for the Soviet Air Forces by the Mikoyan design bureau as a replacement for the earlier MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot;; the MiG-31 is based on and shares design elements with the MiG-25.

The MiG-31 is one of the fastest known operational combat aircraft in the world as of 2021, with a top speed around . It continues to be operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The other operator, the Kazakh Air Defence Forces, retired the type in 2023. The Russian Defence Ministry expects the MiG-31 to remain in service until at least 2030; that was confirmed in 2020 when an announcement was made to extend the service lifetime of the existing airframes from 2,500 to 3,500 hours.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
The single-seat MiG-25 could achieve high speed, altitude, and rate of climb, but it lacked manoeuvrability at interception speeds and was difficult to fly at low altitudes. The MiG-25&#x27;s speed was normally limited to Mach 2.83, but it could reach a maximum speed of at least Mach 3.2 with the risk of engine damage.
Development of the MiG-25&#x27;s replacement began with the Ye-155MP () prototype, which first flew on 16 September 1975. Although it bore a superficial resemblance to the MiG-25, it had a longer fuselage to accommodate the radar operator&#x27;s cockpit, and was in many respects a new design. An important development was the MiG-31&#x27;s advanced radar, capable of both look-up and look-down/shoot-down engagement, as well as multiple target tracking. This gave the Soviet Union an interceptor with the capability to engage the most likely Western intruders (low-flying cruise missiles and bombers) at long range. The MiG-31 replaced the Tu-128 as the Soviet Union&#x27;s dedicated long-range interceptor, with far more advanced sensors and weapons, while its range is almost double that of the MiG-25.

Like that of its MiG-25 predecessor, the introduction of the MiG-31 was surrounded by early speculation and misinformation concerning its design and abilities. The West learned of the new interceptor from Lieutenant Viktor Belenko, a pilot who defected to Japan in 1976 with his MiG-25P. Belenko described an upcoming &quot;Super Foxbat&quot; with two seats and an ability to intercept cruise missiles. According to his testimony, the new interceptor was to have air intakes similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, which the MiG-31 does not have, at least in production variants.

=== Production ===
Serial production of the MiG-31 began in 1979. The first production batch of 519 MiG-31s including 349 &quot;baseline models&quot; was produced at the Sokol plant between 1976 and 1988. The second batch of 101 MiG-31DZs was produced from 1989 to 1991. The final batch of 69 MiG-31B aircraft was produced between 1990 and 1994. From the final batch, 50 were retained by the Kazakhstan Air Force after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Of the &quot;baseline models&quot;, 40 airframes were upgraded to MiG-31BS standard.

=== Upgrades and replacement ===
Some upgrade programs have found their way into the MiG-31 fleet, such as the MiG-31BM multirole version with upgraded avionics, new multimode radar, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls, liquid crystal (LCD) colour multifunction displays (MFDs), ability to carry the R-77 missile and various Russian air-to-ground missiles (AGMs) such as the Kh-31 anti-radiation missile (ARM), a new and more powerful computer, and digital data links. A project to upgrade the Russian MiG-31 fleet to the MiG-31BM standard began in 2010; 100 aircraft were to be upgraded to the MiG-31BM standard by 2020. Russian Federation Defence Ministry chief Colonel Yuri Balyko has claimed that the upgrade would increase the combat effectiveness of the aircraft several times over. 18 MIG-31BMs were delivered in 2014. The Russian military was to receive more than 130 upgraded MiG-31BMs, with the first 24 aircraft already delivered according to Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yuri Borisov in his press briefing on 9 April 2015.

Russia planned to start development of a replacement for the MiG-31 by 2019. The aircraft would be called PAK-DP (ПАК ДП, &quot;Перспективный авиационный комплекс дальнего перехвата&quot; – Prospective Air Complex for Long-Range Interception). Development of the new aircraft, designated MiG-41, began in April 2013. Such development is favored over restarting MiG-31 production. In March 2014, Russian test pilot Anatoly Kvochur said that work began on a Mach 4 capable MiG-41 based on the MiG-31. Later reports stated that the development of the MiG-31 replacement was to begin in 2017, with the first aircraft to be delivered in 2020, and the replacement entering service in 2025.

== Design ==
Like the MiG-25, the MiG-31 is a large twin-engined aircraft with side-mounted air intake ramps, a shoulder-mounted wing with an aspect ratio of 2.94, and twin vertical tailfins. Unlike the MiG-25, it has two seats, with the rear occupied by a dedicated weapon systems officer.

The MiG-31 was designed to fulfill these mission objectives:
* Intercept cruise missiles and their launch aircraft by reaching missile launch range in the shortest possible time after departing the loiter area
* Detect and destroy low flying cruise missiles, UAVs and helicopters
* Long-range escort of strategic bombers
* Provide strategic air defense in areas not covered by ground-based air defense systems

The MiG-31 is limited to five &quot;g&quot; when travelling at supersonic speeds. While flying under combat weight, its wing loading is marginal and its thrust-to-weight ratio is favorable. The MiG-31 is not designed for close combat or rapid turning.

The wings and airframe of the MiG-31 are stronger than those of the MiG-25, permitting supersonic flight at low altitudes. Like the MiG-25, its flight surfaces are built primarily of nickel-steel alloy, enabling the aircraft to tolerate kinetic heating at airspeeds approaching Mach 3. The MiG-31 airframe comprises 49% arc-welded nickel steel, 33% light metal alloy, 16% titanium, and 2% composites. Its D30-F6 jet engines, each rated at 152 kN thrust, allow a maximum speed of Mach 1.23 at low altitude. High-altitude speed is temperature-redlined to Mach 2.83 – the thrust-to-drag ratio is sufficient for speeds in excess of Mach 3, but such speeds pose unacceptable hazards to engine and airframe life in routine use.

=== Electronics suite ===
The MiG-31 was among the first aircraft with a phased-array radar.

The MiG-31 was the world&#x27;s first operational fighter with a passive electronically scanned array radar, the &quot;Zaslon S-800&quot;. Its maximum range against fighter-sized targets is about , and it can track up to 10 targets and simultaneously attack four of them with its Vympel R-33 missiles. The radar is matched with an infrared search and track system in a retractable under-nose fairing.

The MiG-31 was equipped with RK-RLDN and APD-518 digital secure datalinks. The RK-RLDN datalink is for communication with ground-control centers. The APD-518 datalink enables a flight of four MiG-31s to automatically exchange radar-generated data within of each other. It also enables other aircraft with less sophisticated avionics, such as MiG-23s, 25s, and 29s and Su-15s and 27s, to be directed to targets spotted by MiG-31 (a maximum of four (long-range) for each MiG-31 aircraft). The A-50 AEW aircraft and MiG-31 can automatically exchange aerial and terrestrial radar target designation, as well as air defense. The MiG-31 is equipped with ECM of radar and infrared ranges.

The flight-navigation equipment of the MiG-31 includes a complex of automatic control system SAU-155МP and sighting-navigation complex KN-25 with two inertial systems and IP-1-72A with digital computer, electronic long-range navigation system Radical NP (312) or A-331, electronic system of the long-range navigation A-723. Distant radio navigation is carried out by means of two systems: Chayka (similar to the system of Loran) and «Route» (similar to the system of Omega).

Similarly to the complex S-300 missile system, aircraft group with APD-518 can share data obtained by various radars from different directions (active or passive scanning of radiation) and summarize the data. The target can be detected passively (via its emissions of jamming or use of its radar) and/or actively simultaneously from many different directions (with the MiG-31 using its radar). Every aircraft with the APD-518 will have the exact data, even if it is not involved in the search.
* interacting with ground-based automated digital control system (ACS «Rubezh» Operating radius of , can control multiple groups of planes), operating modes of remote aiming, semiautomated actions (coordinate support), singly, and also to direct on the target missiles launched from the other aircraft.
* Digital immune system provides the automatic exchange of tactical information in a group of four interceptors, remote one from another at a distance of and aiming at the target group of fighters with less-powerful avionics (in this case the aircraft performs the role of guidance point or repeater).
A group of four MiG-31 interceptors is able to control an area of air space across a total length of ; its radar possessing a maximum detection range of in distance (radius) and the typical width of detection along the front of .

=== Radars ===
Adopted in 1981, RP-31 N007 &quot;backstop&quot; (Russian: &quot;Zaslon&quot;).
* the range of detection of air targets with Zaslon-A: (for the purpose of a radar cross-section of 19 m2 on a collision angle with probability 0.5)
* target detection distance with radar cross-section of in the rear within with a probability of 0.5
* number of detected targets: 24 (was originally 10)
* number of targets for attack: 6 (was originally 4)
* range of automatic tracking: 
* detection of infrared signature targets: 
* Effective in the detection of cruise missiles and other targets against ground clutter
* Until 2000, it was the world&#x27;s only fighter in service equipped with phased array radar, when the Mitsubishi F-2 entered service with the J/APG-1 active phased array radar.
* Able to intercept and destroy cruise missiles flying at extremely low altitudes.

=== Variant differences ===
The basic differences between other versions and the MiG-31BM are:
* The onboard radar complex of the MiG-31BM can track 24 airborne targets at one time, six of which can be simultaneously attacked by R-33S missiles.
* Modernized variants of the aircraft can be equipped with anti-radiation missiles Kh-31, Kh-25MR or MPU (up to six units), anti-ship Kh-31A (up to six), air-to-surface class missiles Kh-29 and Kh-59 (up to three) or Kh-59M (up to two units), up to six precision bombs KAB-1500 or eight KAB-500 with television or laser-guidance. Maximum mass of payload is .
* The MiG-31M, MiG-31D, and MiG-31BM standard aircraft have an upgraded &quot;Zaslon-M&quot; radar, with larger antenna and greater detection range (said to be against AWACS-size targets) and the ability to attack multiple targets  – air and ground – simultaneously. The Zaslon-M has a diameter (larger) antenna, with 50–100% better performance than Zaslon. In April 1994 it was used with an R-37 to hit a target at distance. It has a search range of for a RCS target and can track 24 targets at once, engaging six, or for . Relative target speed detection increased from Mach 5 to Mach 6, improving the probability of destroying fast-moving targets. The MiG-31BM is one of only a few Soviet aircraft able to intercept and destroy cruise missiles flying at extremely low altitude.

=== Cockpit ===
The aircraft is a two-seater with the rear seat occupant controlling the radar. Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a centre stick and left hand throttles. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero ejection seats which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.

=== Armament ===

The MiG-31&#x27;s main armament is four R-33 air-to-air missiles (NATO codename AA-9 &#x27;Amos&#x27;) carried under the belly.
* One GSh-6-23 cannon with 260 rounds. (The MiG-31&#x27;s predecessor, the MiG-25 did not include a cannon.)
* Fuselage recesses for four R-33 (AA-9 &#x27;Amos&#x27;) or four R-37 (AA-13 &#x27;Arrow&#x27;) (MiG-31BM only).
* Four underwing pylons for a combination of six places for charging (two spaces to add removable fuel tanks)
** Six R-37 long-range air-to-air missiles .
** Four R-33 long-range missiles .
** (?)× Kh-31 (AS-17 &#x27;Krypton&#x27;) long-range air-to-ground missiles () for high-speed target (maneuvering with an overload of 8 g).
** (?)× R-33 (AA-9 &quot;Amos&quot;) (1981) , R-33S (1999) .
** Two or four (superior limit)× R-40TD1 (AA-6 &#x27;Acrid&#x27;) medium-range missiles (R-40 – ), MiG-25P, 1970) launched at altitudes of (maneuvering with overload four g).
** Four R-60 (AA-8 &#x27;Aphid&#x27;)
*** Four R-73 (AA-11 &#x27;Archer&#x27;) short-range IR missiles,
*** Four R-77 (AA-12 &#x27;Adder&#x27;) medium-range missiles () for high-speed target (maneuvering with overload of 12 g).
* Some aircraft are equipped to launch the Kh-31P (AS-17 &#x27;Krypton&#x27;) and Kh-58 (AS-11 &#x27;Kilter&#x27;) anti-radiation missiles in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role. Anti-ship missiles Kh-31A (up to six) and air-to-surface missiles Kh-59 and Kh-29T (up to three) or X-59M (up to two units), up to six air bombs KAB-1500, or up to eight KAB-500 with a television or laser-guidance. Maximum weight of the combat load is .
* One Kh-47M2 Kinzhal high-precision ballistic missile with a range of about (including range of launching aircraft), Mach 10 speed. It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. This gave the MiG-31 long range strike capabilities for the first time, alongside its primary interceptor role. (Only MiG-31K variants equipped)

== Operational history ==

Serial production of the MiG-31 began in 1979. The MiG-31 entered operational service with the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) in 1981.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, MiG-31 aircraft have reportedly shot down several Ukrainian aircraft, mainly by using the long range R-37 air-to-air missile. By remaining at high speed and high altitude, MiG-31s have been able to operate virtually unopposed due to Ukrainian fighters lacking range, speed, or altitude necessary to engage the MiG-31.

As of 8 September 2024, three MiG-31BMs have been visually confirmed as lost, with two being destroyed by Ukrainian missile strike on Belbek airfield in occupied Crimea on 15th of May 2024, and third crashed during takeoff on the same airfield on 1 October 2022, with satellite images showing clear visible wreck, with jet having run off the end of the runway and fell off a cliff before exploding.

The R-37M has, since October 2022, been the main threat against the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force has a significant lack of fire-and-forget missiles. They relied on the R-27 missiles, both the R-27ER and R-27ET; the R-27ER&#x27;s range is . A Ukrainian pilot must illuminate a Russian aircraft with radar to guide the missile to the target. Russian pilots firing the active-radar, fire-and-forget R-77 give them the ability to launch their missiles and then take evasive action. Ukrainian pilots were forced to &quot;exploit ground clutter and terrain-masking to get close enough to fire before being engaged&quot;. During the first three days of the war both sides lost aircraft. The Ukrainians replaced them with older airframes that were made flyable. The Russian Aerospace Forces turned to the MiG-31 with the R-37M missile that has a range of . Combined with the superior radar on the MiG-31, the Ukrainian Air Force has started losing more aircraft. A report by the Royal United Services Institute states that in October some six R-37Ms were being fired at the Ukrainian Air Force a day. Four MiG-31s were also deployed to Crimea. To avoid R-37M missiles, Ukraine has had to attempt to destroy MiG-31s while they are still on the ground, such as the attack on the Belbek airbase and an attempted drone attack in August.

On the early morning of 4 May 2023, a Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile was intercepted by the Patriot air defense system according to the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, general Mykola Oleschuk. The missile was fired from a MiG-31K in Russian airspace. Ukraine confirmed the intercept, saying it used the Patriot missile system protecting the Kyiv region.

On 15 May 2024, Russian-installed officials in Crimea claimed that a missile attack caused explosions and fires near the Belbek airfield. Some missiles (possibly ATACMS) struck dropping cluster munitions on the airfield, and according to photographic evidence and satellite imagery, at least two Russian ground-based air defense systems destroyed, likely destroying two MiG-31s, destroyed a fuel farm and damaged one Su-27.

On the morning of 16 May 2023, some six Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles were fired at Kyiv. Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson said that they were launched from six MiG-31Ks. Ukraine claims that all Kinzhals were intercepted but one may have damaged a Patriot battery launcher according to US officials, although there is limited evidence.

=== Export ===
In 1992 Russia offered the MiG-31 to Finland, which had a selection programme ongoing for a new fighter, but the offer was not submitted to the program, where Russia had submitted the MiG-29. Finland did not accept the offer, and chose the new fighter from the selection programme.

Syria ordered eight MiG-31E aircraft in 2007 for the Syrian Air Force. The order was suspended in May 2009 reportedly either due to Israeli pressure or lack of Syrian funds.

== Variants ==

;Ye-155MP (MiG-25MP): Prototype modification of the early MiG-31. First flight on 16 September 1975.

;MiG-31: First variant which entered in serial production. 349 aircraft were built.

;MiG-31M:Development of a more comprehensive advanced version, the MiG-31M, began in 1984 and first flew in 1985, but the dissolution of the Soviet Union prevented it from entering full production. One piece rounded windscreen, small side windows for rear cockpit, wider and deeper dorsal spine. Digital flight controls added, multifunction CRT cockpit displays, multi-mode phased array radar. No gun fitted in this model, refueling probe moved to starboard side of aircraft, fuselage weapon stations increased from 4 to 6 by adding two centre-line stations. Maximum TO weight increased to using increased thrust D-30F6M engines instead of the D-30F6 engines. 1 prototype and 6 flyable pre-production units were produced.

;MiG-31D: Two aircraft were designated as Type 31D and were manufactured as dedicated anti-satellite models with ballast in the nose instead of radars, flat fuselage undersurface (i.e. no recessed weapon system bays) and had large winglets above and below the wing-tips. Equipped with Vympel ASAT missiles. Two prototypes were built.

;MiG-31LL: Special modification used as a flying laboratory for testing of ejection seats during flight.

;MiG-31 01DZ: Two-seat all weather, all altitude interceptor. Designated as MiG-31 01DZ when fitted with air-to-air refueling probe. One hundred produced of DZ variant.

;MiG-31B: Second production batch with upgraded avionics and in-flight refueling probe introduced in 1990. Its development was the result of the Soviet discovery that Phazotron radar division engineer Adolf Tolkachev had sold information on advanced radars to the West. A new version of the compromised radar was hastily developed. MiG-31B also have the improved ECM and EW equipment with integration of improved R-33S missiles. Long range navigation system compatible with Loran/Omega and Chaka ground stations added. This model replaced the 01DZ models in late 1990.

;MiG-31E: Export version of the MiG-31B with simplified avionics. Never entered in serial production.

;MiG-31BS: Designation applied to type 01DZ when converted to MiG-31B standard.

;MiG-31BM: After passing state testing in 2008, this modernized variant of MiG-31B was approved for introduction into air force of Russia. 50 planes are modified to the MiG-31BM (Bolshaya Modernizatsiya/Big Modernization) standard, in accordance with the 2011 contract. The efficiency of the modernized MiG-31BM is 2.6 times greater than the basic MiG-31. The MiG-31BМ&#x27;s maximum detection range for air targets was increased in the upgrade to . It had the ability to automatically track up to ten targets, and the latest units can track up to 24 targets and simultaneously engage up to eight targets. The on-board Argon-K is replaced with the new Baget 55-06 computer that selects four targets of the highest priority, which simultaneously are engaged by long-range R-33S air-to-air missiles. A new long range missile R-37 (missile) with a speed of Mach 6 and a range of up to is developed during the modernization process for use with the newly modernized MiG-31. The MiG-31BM has a multi-role capability, and is capable of using anti-radar, air-to-ship and air-to-ground missiles. Some of its avionics are unified with the MiG-29SMT. It also has a refueling probe. MiG-31BM set a sustained flight record for the model while spending seven hours and four minutes in the air while covering the distance of .

;MiG-31BSM: An upgrade of the BS version, it is the latest modernization variant first time contracted in 2014 for modernization of 60 aircraft, it is very similar in some aspects to the BM standard. Unlike the BS standard, aircraft modernized into the BSM standard are equipped with air refueling probe. Improvements were made to the aircraft canopy, where new and better heat resistant glass was used, thus enabling the MiG-31BSM to fly with cruise speed of at long distances without any damage. Furthermore, new faster central computer Baget-55-06 is used with addition of multi-functional displays, one for the pilot and three for the weapons operator-navigator. Also there is a new set of navigation equipment. The MiG-31BSM has multi-role capability with ability to use anti-radar, anti-ship and air-to-ground missiles. The main visible difference between the BS and BSM standards a rear-view periscope above the front cockpit canopy.

;MiG-31K: Modified MiG-31BM variant able to carry the hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ALBM. Ten aircraft were modified by May 2018. With this modification and with removed APU for air-to-air missiles, the aircraft gained a sole role of an attack aircraft.

;MiG-31F: Planned fighter-bomber intended for use with TV, radar and laser-guided ASM weapon systems. Never entered serial production.

;MiG-31FE: Planned export version of the MiG-31F.

;MiG-31I (Ishim): Proposed modification for air launch to orbit of small spacecraft with a payload of to altitude or to altitude orbit.

;MiG-31 (&quot;Izdeliye 08&quot;): MiG-31 modified into a launch-platform for the &quot;Izdeliye 293&quot; &quot;Burevestnik&quot; anti-satellite missile. At least two prototypes are converted. Tests from September 2018.

;MiG-31I: The latest version of the aircraft which reportedly adds an in-flight refueling capability and includes different engines, avionics and missiles, fly-by-wire and an electronic remote control system which allows to launch Kinzhal missiles at a predetermined moment. It is assumed that all MiG-31K aircraft will be upgraded to this standard. Completed flight tests in April 2024.

== Notable accidents ==
On 4 April 1984, a MiG-31 crashed while on a test flight, killing Mikoyan chief test pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov and his navigator V. Zaitsev.

On 26 April 2017, a MiG-31 crashed after it was accidentally hit by &quot;friendly fire&quot; during a training session near the Telemba proving ground in the Russian Far East. This occurred during a training exercise over the Telemba proving ground in Buryatia; both crew members ejected successfully. While Russian state media did not offer any details, independent investigators discovered from a leaked government document that the aircraft was shot down by an R-33 missile fired from another MiG-31 and that pilot error from both airplanes was at fault. The report also suggested problems with the Zaslon-AM radar and Baget-55 fire control system that might increase the risk of more accidental shootdowns.

On 16 April 2020, a MiG-31 interceptor of the Kazakh Air Force crashed in the country&#x27;s Karaganda region.

On 8 April 2022, a MiG-31 of the Russian Aerospace Forces crashed in the Leningrad region.

On 2 December 2022, a MiG-31 of the Russian Aerospace Forces crashed during a training flight in the far eastern Primorsky Region.

On 26 April 2023, a MiG-31 of the Russian Aerospace Forces crashed during a training flight in northern Murmansk. The pilots reportedly ejected and survived.

On 4 July 2023, a MiG-31 of the Russian Aerospace Forces crashed during a training flight over Avacha Bay.

<text>Courtney Andrew Walsh OJ (born 30 October 1962) is a Jamaican former cricketer who represented the West Indies from 1984 to 2001, captaining the West Indies in 22 Test matches. He is a fast bowler and considered one of the all-time greats, best known for a remarkable opening bowling partnership along with fellow West Indian Curtly Ambrose for several years. Walsh played 132 Tests and 205 ODIs for the West Indies and took 519 and 227 wickets respectively. He shared 421 Test wickets with Ambrose in 49 matches. He held the record of most Test wickets from 2000, after he broke the record of Kapil Dev. This record was later broken in 2004 by Shane Warne. He was the first bowler to reach 500 wickets in Test cricket. His autobiography is entitled &quot;Heart of the Lion&quot;. Walsh was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1987. In October 2010, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was appointed as the Specialist Bowling Coach of Bangladesh Cricket Team in August 2016.

==Early life and first-class career==
Courtney Andrew Walsh was born on 30 October 1962 in Kingston, Jamaica. He played his early cricket there with the same cricket club for which Michael Holding also played cricket—the Melbourne club. Walsh&#x27;s first claim to fame came in 1979 when he took 10 wickets in an innings in school cricket, and three years later he made his first-class cricket debut. He played 427 matches of this format between 1981 and 2001, and took 1,807 wickets at the average of 21.71, including 104 five-wicket hauls and 20 ten-wicket hauls. Walsh played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club (Gloucestershire CCC) from 1985 to 1998.

Walsh played cricket for the West Indies from 1984 to 2001, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club (Gloucestershire CCC) from 1984 to 1998, Jamaica cricket team from 1981–82 to 1999–00, Rest of the World XI in 1987 and West Indies A in 1991–92. He first played for Gloucestershire CCC in 1984 and was a mainstay of the side until 1998.

==International career==
Walsh made his Test debut against Australia in Perth in 1984, taking 2 wickets for 43 runs. He played six Test matches during the 1984–85 season, five against Australia in the 1984–85 series between the teams, and one Test against New Zealand in the home series. He took 16 wickets in the season conceding 507 runs. In the same season, Walsh also made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka at Hobart during the World Series Cup. He took one wicket for 47 from 10 overs in the match. In the next two seasons, Walsh played a match at home against England, three matches against Pakistan and three matches against New Zealand, both outside the West Indies. He took 29 wickets from seven matches in these seasons, including a five-wicket haul against New Zealand. In 1987, Walsh was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performance the previous year.

In the 1987–88 season, Walsh toured India and played four Test matches against them, taking 26 wickets at an average of 16.80. In the first Test of the series at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, he took six wickets for 67 runs, including five wickets for 54 runs in India&#x27;s second innings. In the first innings of the second Test at Wankhede Stadium, he repeated the same performance of five for 54. In that season, Pakistan cricket team visited the West Indies and played three Tests there. In the 1987 Cricket World Cup Walsh backed out to ball and run out Saleem Jaffar as he was backing up as Pakistan required two off the last ball to qualify for the semi-finals, Abdul Qadir eventually scored the winning runs and West Indies lost but Walsh was deservedly feted for his sportsmanship, he even received a hand-woven carpet from a local fan. Walsh underperformed in the series, taking only four wickets from three matches. He played four matches against England in 1988, and took 12 wickets at an average of 34.33. During the West Indies tour of Australia in 1988–89, Walsh played five Tests and took 17 wickets at 29.41. His best bowling in the series came the first innings of the first match, taking four wickets for 62 runs, including a hat-trick. He took an unusual hat-trick that covered two innings at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, dismissing Australia&#x27;s Tony Dodemaide with the last ball of the first innings and Mike Veletta and Graeme Wood with his first two deliveries in the second. During that winter he also took 10 wickets in a Test match for the first time against India in Kingston.

In 1994, he was appointed captain of the West Indies for the tours of India and New Zealand after Richie Richardson was ordered to rest because of &quot;acute fatigue syndrome&quot;. In 1995, he took 62 Test wickets at an average of 21.75 runs per wicket, a performance which he bettered in 2000 when he took 66 Test wickets at an average of 18.69, including 34 wickets in the Test series against England at an average of 12.82 runs per wicket. Coming close to the record for a West Indian bowler of 35 wickets in a Test series (set by Malcolm Marshall in 1988). In the 1990s, his partnership with Curtly Ambrose was one of the most feared bowling attacks in world cricket.

During the first part of his career, Walsh served as the &quot;stock&quot; bowler in an attack featuring Marshall, Joel Garner and later Ambrose, but after the retirement of Marshall and Garner took the role as opening bowler. His action lacked the elegance of those bowlers, but its economy and his natural athleticism ensured he was accurate and durable, even over very long spells and he used his height (about 198 cm, or six-foot-six) to extract vicious bounce. Even as he lost pace in the later stage of his career he continued to take wickets at an undiminished rate; teams tended to defend against him and Ambrose and attack the weaker third and fourth bowlers.

Walsh played his last ODI against New Zealand in 2000 and his last Test match against South Africa in his homeland, Jamaica, in 2001.

Walsh is one of only seven bowlers to have bowled over 5000 overs in Test cricket, the others being Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka, Shane Warne and Nathan Lyon of Australia, Anil Kumble of India and James Anderson and Stuart Broad of England. He is also one of only seven bowlers to have taken 500 or more Test wickets. In ODIs, Walsh was not as successful although he will be remembered for his best performance, 5 wickets for just 1 run against Sri Lanka in 1986. In first-class cricket, he took 5 wickets in an innings more than 100 times and 10 wickets in a match 20 times.

His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both forms of the game. By the end of his career, he had such a reputation for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced. Whether this was in appreciation of his batting or an attempt to wind up the bowling side is open to interpretation. His most significant (if scoreless) innings came when he kept Brian Lara company during a last-wicket stand to ensure victory in the match (and thus a draw in the series) against Australia in the Third Test in 1999 (Walsh also took seven wickets in the match). A trademark of his batting was an elaborate windmilling leave-alone. Walsh is a much loved and respected cricketer and the West Indies have yet to find a fast bowler with anything approaching his talents.

Walsh is also famous for his sportsmanlike gesture of not mankading last man Saleem Jaffar of Pakistan in a World Cup match in 1987, which cost the West Indies the match and a place in the semi-finals.

He is currently a regular feature of the Lashings World XI alongside other cricket legends including Sachin Tendulkar and fellow West Indian Richie Richardson. In May 2004, Walsh was chosen one of the Jamaica&#x27;s five greatest cricketers of all time.

He has a dubious distinction of being one of three players to play more than 100 test matches and not make a half-century, the others being Nathan Lyon and Makhaya Ntini.

==Records==

Walsh took 5 wickets in an ODI match conceding only one run against Sri Lanka in December 1986, a match which the West Indies won at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, Sharjah by 193 runs. This was his solitary five-wicket haul in the format. In February 1998, he played his 100th Test, against England in Georgetown, Guyana. In 2000, Walsh became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket, breaking a six-year-old record of Kapil Dev&#x27;s 434 wickets. He achieved the feat in his 114th match, which are 17 matches less than Kapil Dev. Walsh became the first bowler to reach 500 wickets in the history of Test cricket. He achieved the feat against South Africa in 2001, getting Jacques Kallis leg before wicket in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. Throughout his Test career, Walsh produced one of the greatest opening partnership with Curtly Ambrose as a bowler, and shared 421 wickets from 49 matches with the latter. Walsh&#x27;s 519 wickets in Test cricket was a record at that time, which was surpassed by Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan in 2004.

Walsh&#x27;s feats with the bat are rather less flattering, as indicated by an average of seven in both Test cricket and ODIs. He also holds the record for the most Test ducks (43), and also held the record for the most &quot;not outs&quot; – 61 times – until passed by James Anderson in 2017.

Walsh played 132 Tests and 205 ODI matches, and took 519 and 227 wickets respectively. He took 22 five wicket hauls in Tests—of which five fifers came in the first 63 appearances and 17 in the later 69 appearances—and one in ODIs.

Walsh holds the record for the best bowling figures (13 for 55) for a captain in a Test match.

==Retirement==
During his Test career, spanned over seventeen years, Walsh bowled 5004.1 overs, captured 519 wickets at an average of 24.45 runs and at a strike rate of 57.55 in 132 Test matches. Cricket critics considered him that he was &quot;one of the most admired cricketers of recent times and will long be remembered as one of the game&#x27;s most revered players.&quot; He played last time in Test cricket against South Africa in April 2001, a match 
West Indies won by 130 runs at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica. He took six wickets for 103 runs in the match. In ODIs, he took 227 wickets from 205 matches at an average of 30.47. His last ODI came in January 2000, against New Zealand at Jade Stadium, Christchurch in which he took one wicket for 70 runs.

Former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd attributed Walsh: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find another Courtney Walsh around and if I was a young fast bowlers, I&#x27;d want to emulate him.&quot; Former West Indian all-rounder Garry Sobers said about him that the &quot;young crop of fast bowlers can take from him his dedication to West Indies and his ability to be always there, trying and giving 100 per cent in difficult conditions.&quot;

==Post-retirement==
After his career as a selector for the West Indies national cricket team, Walsh signed as bowling coach of Bangladesh in August, 2016. His contract expired after the 2019 Cricket World Cup and he left his position as Bangladesh bowling coach along with then Bangladesh head coach Steve Rhodes.

Courtney Walsh is the son of Joan Wollaston and also owns a restaurant in Jamaica called Cuddyz. In November 2019, he was appointed as the assistant coach to the head coach Gus Logie for the West Indies women&#x27;s cricket team.

==Coaching career==
Walsh was appointed bowling coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team in September 2016 on a three-year contract. He was appointed interim head coach in February 2018 following the resignation of Chandika Hathurusingha, with his first tournament in charge being the 2018 Nidahas Trophy.

In October 2020, he was appointed as head coach of West Indies women&#x27;s national cricket team. After the 2023 T20 World Cup, Cricket West Indies decided not to renew his contract.

==Awards and honours==
Walsh was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1987, and the cricket almanack &quot;Wisden&quot; noted his &quot;three distinct speeds, all delivered with the same action&quot;, and his &quot;sparing use of the bouncer, his shorter deliveries generally threatening the batsman&#x27;s rib-cage, a tactic which, allied to change of pace, produced many catches in the short-leg area off splice or glove.&quot; Walsh was selected as one of the &quot;West Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year&quot; in 1988. He was named one Jamaica&#x27;s greatest cricketers of all time in 2004.

In October 2010, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame along with Joel Garner, joining the other fifteen West Indian players.

<text>Urbain Grandier (1590 – 18 August 1634) was a French Catholic priest who was burned at the stake after being convicted of witchcraft, following the events of the so-called &quot;Loudun possessions&quot;. Most modern commentators have concluded that Grandier was the victim of a politically motivated persecution led by the powerful Cardinal Richelieu.

The circumstances of Father Grandier&#x27;s trial and execution have attracted the attention of writers Alexandre Dumas père, Eyvind Johnson, Aldous Huxley and the playwright John Whiting, filmmaker Ken Russell, composers like Krzysztof Penderecki and Peter Maxwell Davies, as well as historian Jules Michelet and various scholars of European witchcraft.

==Life==

Grandier attended the Jesuit college of La Madeleine in Bordeaux. His uncle was a priest who held some influence with the Jesuits there. They held the right to appoint the parish priest for the Church of Saint-Pierre-du-Marche in Loudun, and in 1617 chose Grandier. They also had the right to name a canon to the collegiate Church of Sainte Croix, also in Loudun, and Grandier was appointed to that as well. Thus, as the eldest son, he was able to support his widowed mother and siblings. That he should receive both valuable positions over a local candidate caused some resentment. Both benefices were in the Diocese of Poitiers.

Sometime around 1629 or 1630, Philippa Trincant, daughter of Louis Trincant, the king&#x27;s prosecutor and a friend of Grandier, gave birth to a son. It was widely suspected that Grandier was the father. He was also believed to have had intimate relations with a number of women.

==Allegations of sorcery==
In 1632, a group of nuns from the local Ursuline convent accused him of having bewitched them, sending the demon Asmodai, among others, to commit evil and impudent acts with them. Aldous Huxley, in his non-fiction book, &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;, argued that the accusations began after Grandier refused to become spiritual director of the convent, unaware that the Mother Superior, Jeanne des Anges, had become obsessed with him after having seen him from afar and heard of his sexual exploits. According to Huxley, Mother Jeanne, enraged by his rejection, instead invited Canon Jean Mignon, an enemy of Grandier, to become the director. Jeanne then accused Grandier of using black magic to seduce her. The other nuns gradually began to make similar accusations. However, Monsieur des Niau, Counsellor at la Flèche, said that Grandier applied for the position, but that it was instead awarded to Canon Jean Mignon, a nephew of Monsieur Trincant.

The Archbishop of Bordeaux intervened and ordered the nuns sequestered, upon which the instances of possession seemed to have stopped.

==Richelieu==

Grandier had gained the enmity of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of France. In its continuing efforts to consolidate and centralize power, the Crown had ordered the walls around Loudun to be demolished. The populace were of two minds concerning this, whether to keep the wall or rely on the central government for protection. Grandier supported those who wished to retain the walls. In addition, not only had Grandier written a book attacking the discipline of clerical celibacy, he had also penned a scathing satire on the cardinal.

Around the time of the nuns&#x27; accusations, M. Jean de Laubardemont, a relative of the Mother Superior of the convent of Loudun, was sent to demolish the town tower. He was prevented from doing so by the town militia, and upon returning to Paris reported on the state of affairs in Loudun including the recent disturbance at the Ursuline convent. In November 1633, Laubardemont was commissioned to investigate the matter. Grandier was arrested and confined to the prison at Angers. Laubardemont returned to Paris, where letters in support of Grandier from the Bailly of Loudun to the Procurator-General of the Parliament, stating that the possession was an &quot;imposture&quot;, were intercepted.

==Trial==
Laubardemont returned to Loudun with a Decree of the Council, dated 31 May 1634, confirming all his powers and prohibiting Parlement and all other judges from interfering in the matter, and forbidding all parties concerned from appealing, under penalty of a fine of five hundred livres. Grandier, who had been held at the prison of Angers, was returned to Loudun. Both the examination of witnesses and the exorcisms of the Ursulines continued. After Grandier had been tortured, documents were introduced purportedly signed by him and several demons as evidence that he had made a diabolical pact. It is not clear whether Grandier wrote or signed the pacts under duress, or whether they were forged.

Grandier was found guilty and sentenced to death. The judges who condemned Grandier ordered that he be put to the &quot;extraordinary question&quot;, a form of torture which was usually, but not immediately, fatal, and was therefore administered to only those victims who were to be executed soon afterwards. In addition, Grandier was subjected to a form of the Spanish boot, an iron vise filled with spikes, that was brought to red heat and then applied to the calves and ankles to shatter the bones. Despite torture, Grandier never confessed to witchcraft. He was then burned alive at the stake.

Many theories exist as to the cause of the Loudun &quot;possessions&quot;. One of the most likely explanations is that the whole affair was orchestrated by Richelieu. Huxley in his book &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; (1952) and in the Ken Russell film version of the Huxley book (1971) alleged that the initial accusations against Grandier by the nuns of the convent of Loudun were part of a case of collective hysteria.

Augustin Calmet, among others, compared this case to the pretended possession of Martha Broissier (1578), which received a great deal of circulation at the time. This criticism was in part due to the fact that the circumstances revolving the incidents and the examinations of possession in question show more indications of pretended possessions than that of more dominantly legitimate cases, such as the possession of Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing (1621). In his Treatise, it is stated that the causes of the injustice committed at Loudun were a mixture of political ambition, the need for attention, and a basic desire to dispose of political opponents. The Loudun affair took place in the reign of Louis XIII; Cardinal Richelieu is accused of having caused this tragedy, in order to ruin Grandier, the Curé of Loudun, for having written a cutting satire against him.

==Diabolical pact==

One of the documents introduced as evidence during Grandier&#x27;s second trial is a diabolical pact written in Latin and apparently signed by Grandier. Another, which looks illegible, is written backwards, in Latin with scribal abbreviation, and has since been published and translated in a number of books on witchcraft. This document also carries many strange symbols, and was signed by several demons including Satan himself. Deciphered and translated to English, it reads:
We, the influential Lucifer, the young Satan, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Elimi,
and Astaroth, together with others, have today accepted the covenant pact
of Urbain Grandier, who is ours. And him do we promise 
the love of women, the flower of virgins, the respect of monarchs, honours, lusts and powers.
He will go whoring three days long; the carousal will be dear to him. He offers us once
in the year a seal of blood, under the feet, he will trample the holy things of the church and
he will ask us many questions; with this pact, he will live twenty years happy
on the earth of men, and will later join us to sin against God.
Bound in Hell, in the council of demons.
Lucifer Beelzebub Satan
Astaroth Leviathan Elimi
The seals placed the Devil, the master, and the demons, princes of the lord.
Baalberith, writer.

An 18th-century book written by historian Nicholas Aubin contains his findings on the Devils of Loudun. The book is titled, &quot;The Cheats and Illusions of Romish Priests and Exorcists Discovered in the History of the Devils of Loudun.&quot;

Grandier&#x27;s trials were the subject of two treatments by Alexandre Dumas, père: an entry in volume four of his &quot;Crimes Célèbres&quot; (1840) and a novel, &quot;Urbain Grandier&quot; (1850).

The French historian Jules Michelet discussed Grandier in a chapter of &quot;La Sorcière&quot; (1862).

The Swedish author Eyvind Johnson based his 1949 novel &quot;Drömmar om rosor och eld&quot; on Grandier and the Loudun possessions.

The same subject was revisited in the book-length essay &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;, by Aldous Huxley, published in 1952. Huxley&#x27;s book was adapted for the stage in 1961 by John Whiting (commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company). The play was adapted for the movie screen by Ken Russell in 1971 (as &quot;The Devils&quot;). The novel was also adapted for the opera stage in 1969 by Krzysztof Penderecki (as &quot;Die Teufel von Loudun&quot;). It was also an inspiration for &quot;Matka Joanna od Aniołów&quot; (&quot;Mother Joan of the Angels&quot;) – a film by Jerzy Kawalerowicz after the story (&quot;Matka od Aniołów|Mother Joan of the Angels&quot;) by Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz.

Grandier is the subject of &quot;Grandier&#x27;s Funeral Pyre&quot;, a song by Elvenking off the album &quot;The Pagan Manifesto&quot; (2014).

Grandier is also the subject of the song &quot;Devils&quot; by the pagan rock band Inkubus Sukkubus from their 1993 album &quot;Wytches&quot;.

Florida death metal band Morbid Angel used Grandier&#x27;s life as one of the main themes for their album &quot;Covenant&quot;.

The Loudun possessions and Grandier&#x27;s trial are the subject of &quot;Les brasiers ne s&#x27;éteignent jamais&quot; (&quot;The Braziers Never Go Out&quot;) by Michel Gaudo, an adventure module for the French horror RPG &quot;Malefices&quot;. Learning about the historical case helps the investigators solve the mystery.

Grandier is portrayed by Oliver Reed in the 1971 Ken Russell film &quot;The Devils&quot;.

<doc id="252683" wikidata="Q613420" url="?curid=252683" title="Latin Monetary Union">
<text>The Monetary Convention of 23 December 1865 was a unified system of coinage that provided a degree of monetary integration among several European countries, initially Belgium, France, Italy and Switzerland, at a time when the circulation of banknotes in these countries remained relatively marginal. In early 1866, it started being referred to in the British press as the Latin Monetary Union, with intent to make clear that the United Kingdom would not join, and has been generally referred to under that name () and the acronym LMU since then. A number of countries minted coins according to the LMU standard even though they did not formally join the LMU. 

The LMU has been viewed as a forerunner of late-20th-century European monetary union but cannot be directly compared with it, not least since the LMU did not rely on any common institutions. Unlike the Scandinavian Monetary Union established a few years later, the Latin Monetary Union remained limited to coinage and never extended to paper money. That made the LMU increasingly less relevant, and it was quietly disbanded in 1926.

==History==
===Preliminary context===
The LMU adopted the specifications of the French gold franc, which had been introduced by Napoleon I in 1803 and was struck in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 50 and 100 francs, with the 20 franc coin ( of .900 fine gold struck on a planchet) being the most common. In the French system the gold franc was interchangeable with the silver franc based on an exchange ratio of 1:15.5, which was the approximate relative value of the two metals at the time of the law of 1803.

===Initial treaty===

By treaty dated 23 December 1865, France, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland formed the Latin Monetary Union. They agreed to a combined gold and silver standard (bimetallism) with a gold-to-silver ratio of 15.5 to 1 as established in the French Franc. One LMU Franc represented of fine silver or of fine gold. 

The treaty required that all four contracting states strike freely exchangeable gold coins and silver coins according to common specifications. Before the treaty, for example, the fineness of the silver coins in the four states varied from 0.800 to 0.900. The treaty required that the largest silver coin of 5 francs be struck 0.900 fine and the fractional silver of 2 francs, 1 franc, 50 centimes and 20 centimes all be struck at 0.835 fine. The agreement came into force on 1 August 1866.

The LMU served the function of facilitating trade between different countries by setting the standards by which gold and silver currency could be minted and exchanged. In this manner a French trader could accept Italian lire for his goods with confidence that it could be converted back to a comparable amount of francs.

===Further joining members===
Following the International Monetary Conference of 1867, the original four nations were joined by Greece on April 10, 1867. Greece took advantage of a clause in the treaty that guaranteed admission of foreign states that agreed to abide by the treaty. Spain and Romania also considered joining. The discussions broke off unsuccessfully, but both countries nevertheless made an attempt to conform their currencies to the LMU standard. Austria-Hungary refused to join the LMU because it rejected bimetallism, but signed a separate monetary treaty with France on December 24, 1867 whereby both states agreed to receive into their treasuries one another&#x27;s gold coins at specified rates. Austria-Hungary thereafter minted some but not all of its gold coins on the LMU standard, including the 4 and 8 florin, which matched the specifications of the French 10 and 20 francs.

Other states later adopted the system without formally joining the treaty: The colonies of France (including Algeria) came under the scope of the treaty in 1865; Peru adopted the franc system by law on July 31, 1863; Colombia and Venezuela followed in 1871; the Grand Duchy of Finland adopted the system on August 9, 1877; Serbia on November 11, 1878; and Bulgaria on May 17, 1880. Coins struck for the Spanish territory of Puerto Rico in 1895 adhered to the standard, with one peso to five Spanish pesetas. In 1904, the Danish West Indies were also placed on this standard but did not join the Union itself. When Albania emerged from the Ottoman Empire as an independent nation in 1912, coins of the Latin Monetary Union from France, Italy, Greece, and Austria-Hungary began to circulate in place of the Ottoman Lira. Albania did not however mint its own coins, or issue its own paper money until it adopted an independent monetary system in 1925.

With the tacit agreement of Napoleon III of France, Giacomo Antonelli, the administrator of the Papal Treasury, embarked from 1866 on an ambitious increase in silver coinage without the prescribed amount of precious metal, equivalent to Belgium&#x27;s total. The papal coins quickly became debased and excessively circulated in other union states, to the profit of the Holy See, but Swiss and French banks rejected papal coins and the Papal States were ejected from the Union in 1870, owing 20 million lire.

==Issues==
===Bimetallism failure===
From the beginning, fluctuations in the relative value of gold and silver on the world market stressed the currency union. This is today recognized as an inevitable effect of a currency based on bimetallism when precious metal prices fluctuate. When the LMU was formed in 1865, silver was nearing the end of a period of high valuation compared to gold. In 1873 the value of silver dropped significantly, followed by a sharp increase in silver imports in the LMU countries, particularly in France and Belgium. By 1873, the decreasing value of silver made it profitable to mint silver in exchange for gold at the Union&#x27;s standard rate of . Indeed, in all of 1871 and 1872 the French mint had received just 5,000,000 francs of silver for conversion to coin, but in 1873 alone received 154,000,000 francs. Fearing an influx of silver coinage, the member nations of the Union agreed in Paris on January 30, 1874, to limit the free conversion of silver temporarily. By 1878, with no recovery in the silver price in sight, minting of silver coinage was suspended absolutely. From 1873 onwards, the Union was on a &quot;de facto&quot; gold standard. The law still permitted payment in silver, but custom demanded and enforced payment in gold. The 5 franc silver pieces were &quot;essentially upon the same footing as bank notes&quot;.

More importantly, because new discoveries and better refining techniques increased the supply of silver, the fixed LMU exchange rate eventually overvalued silver relative to gold. German traders, in particular, were known to bring silver to LMU countries, have it minted into coinage then exchanged those for gold coins at the discounted exchange rate. These destabilizing tactics eventually forced the LMU to convert to a pure gold standard for its currency in 1878.

===Debasement of the coinage ===
Some members began to debase their currency. and then exchanged them for coins from other countries that had been minted correctly, thus in effect forcing other members of the Union to do the same. According to the BBC, Greece with its &quot;chronically weak economy meant successive Greek governments responded by decreasing the amount of gold in their coins, thereby debasing their currency in relation to those of other nations in the union and in violation of the original agreement&quot;. Greece was formally expelled from the Latin Monetary Union in 1908. It was readmitted in 1910, however.

===Paper money issues===
According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, another major problem of the LMU was that it failed to outlaw the printing of paper money based on the bimetallic currency. France and Italy exploited this weakness by printing banknotes to fund their own endeavours, effectively &quot;forcing other members of the union to bear some of the cost of its fiscal extravagance by issuing notes backed by their currency&quot;. 

===Effect of the Great War ===
In 1922 Latvian lat and in 1924 Polish złoty adopted LMU standard.

The political turbulence of the early twentieth century which culminated in the First World War brought the Latin Monetary Union to its final end in practice, even though it continued &quot;de jure&quot; until 1927, when it came to a formal end.

The last coins made according to the standards (i.e., diameter, weight and silver fineness) of the Union were the Swiss half, one-franc, and two-franc pieces of 1967. However, Austria still mints gold 4 and 8 florin gold coins to the LMU specifications for collectors and investors, and modern gold rounds to LMU standards are also commercially minted.

==Impact==
A 2018 study in the &quot;European Review of Economic History&quot; found that the LMU had no significant effects on trade, except during the period 1865–1874.

The Latin Monetary Union inspired the Scandinavian Monetary Union, established in 1873.

<doc id="252685" wikidata="Q1327315" url="?curid=252685" title="Analogue switch">
<text>An analogue switch, also called a bilateral switch, is an electronic component that behaves in a similar way to a relay, but has no moving parts. The switching element is normally a pair of MOSFET transistors, one an N-channel device, the other a P-channel device. The device can conduct analog or digital signals in either direction when on and isolates the switched terminals when off. Analogue switches are usually manufactured as integrated circuits in packages containing multiple switches (typically two, four or eight). These include the 4016 and 4066 from the 4000 series.

The control input to the device may be a signal that switches between the positive and negative supply voltages, with the more positive voltage switching the device on and the more negative switching the device off. Other circuits are designed to communicate through a serial port with a host controller in order to set switches on or off.

The signal being switched must remain within the bounds of the positive and negative supply rails which are connected to the P-MOS and N-MOS body terminals. The switch generally provides good isolation between the control signal and the input/output signals. They are not used for high voltage switching.

Important parameters of an analogue switch are:
*on-resistance: the resistance when switched on. This commonly ranges from 5 ohms to a few hundred ohms.
*off-resistance: the resistance when switched off. This is typically a number of megaohms or gigaohms.
*signal range: the minimum and maximum voltages allowed for the signal to be passed through. If these are exceeded, the switch may be destroyed by excessive currents. Older types of switches can even &quot;latch up&quot;, which means that they continue to conduct excessive currents even after the faulty signal is removed.
*charge injection. This effect causes the switch to inject a small electric charge into the signal when it switches on, causing a small spike or glitch. The charge injection is specified in coulombs.

Analogue switches are available in both through-hole technology or by surface-mount technology packages.

<doc id="252686" wikidata="Q994399" url="?curid=252686" title="Simplicial complex">
<text>In mathematics, a simplicial complex is a structured set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their &quot;n&quot;-dimensional counterparts, called simplices, such that all the faces and intersections of the elements are also included in the set (see illustration). Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a simplicial set appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory. The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an abstract simplicial complex. To distinguish a simplicial complex from an abstract simplicial complex, the former is often called a geometric simplicial complex.&quot;&quot;

==Definitions==
A simplicial complex formula_1 is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:
:1. Every face of a simplex from formula_1 is also in formula_1.
:2. The non-empty intersection of any two simplices formula_4 is a face of both formula_5 and formula_6.

See also the definition of an abstract simplicial complex, which loosely speaking is a simplicial complex without an associated geometry.

A simplicial &quot;k&quot;-complex formula_1 is a simplicial complex where the largest dimension of any simplex in formula_1 equals &quot;k&quot;. For instance, a simplicial 2-complex must contain at least one triangle, and must not contain any tetrahedra or higher-dimensional simplices.

A pure or homogeneous simplicial &quot;k&quot;-complex formula_1 is a simplicial complex where every simplex of dimension less than &quot;k&quot; is a face of some simplex formula_10 of dimension exactly &quot;k&quot;. Informally, a pure 1-complex &quot;looks&quot; like it&#x27;s made of a bunch of lines, a 2-complex &quot;looks&quot; like it&#x27;s made of a bunch of triangles, etc. An example of a &quot;non&quot;-homogeneous complex is a triangle with a line segment attached to one of its vertices. Pure simplicial complexes can be thought of as triangulations and provide a definition of polytopes.

A facet is a maximal simplex, i.e., any simplex in a complex that is &quot;not&quot; a face of any larger simplex. (Note the difference from a &quot;face&quot; of a simplex). A pure simplicial complex can be thought of as a complex where all facets have the same dimension. For (boundary complexes of) simplicial polytopes this coincides with the meaning from polyhedral combinatorics.

Sometimes the term &quot;face&quot; is used to refer to a simplex of a complex, not to be confused with a face of a simplex.

For a simplicial complex embedded in a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional space, the &quot;k&quot;-faces are sometimes referred to as its cells. The term &quot;cell&quot; is sometimes used in a broader sense to denote a set homeomorphic to a simplex, leading to the definition of cell complex.

The underlying space, sometimes called the carrier of a simplicial complex, is the union of its simplices. It is usually denoted by formula_11 or formula_12.

== Support ==
The relative interiors of all simplices in formula_1 form a partition of its underlying space formula_11: for each point formula_15, there is exactly one simplex in formula_1 containing formula_17 in its relative interior. This simplex is called the support of &quot;x&quot; and denoted formula_18.&quot;&quot;

==Closure, star, and link==
Let &quot;K&quot; be a simplicial complex and let &quot;S&quot; be a collection of simplices in &quot;K&quot;.

The closure of &quot;S&quot; (denoted formula_19) is the smallest simplicial subcomplex of &quot;K&quot; that contains each simplex in &quot;S&quot;. formula_19 is obtained by repeatedly adding to &quot;S&quot; each face of every simplex in &quot;S&quot;.

The star of &quot;S&quot; (denoted formula_21) is the union of the stars of each simplex in &quot;S&quot;. For a single simplex &quot;s&quot;, the star of &quot;s&quot; is the set of simplices in &quot;K&quot; that have &quot;s&quot; as a face. The star of &quot;S&quot; is generally not a simplicial complex itself, so some authors define the closed star of S (denoted formula_22) as formula_23 the closure of the star of S.

The link of &quot;S&quot; (denoted formula_24) equals formula_25. It is the closed star of &quot;S&quot; minus the stars of all faces of &quot;S&quot;.

==Algebraic topology==

In algebraic topology, simplicial complexes are often useful for concrete calculations. For the definition of homology groups of a simplicial complex, one can read the corresponding chain complex directly, provided that consistent orientations are made of all simplices. The requirements of homotopy theory lead to the use of more general spaces, the CW complexes. Infinite complexes are a technical tool basic in algebraic topology. See also the discussion at Polytope of simplicial complexes as subspaces of Euclidean space made up of subsets, each of which is a simplex. That somewhat more concrete concept is there attributed to Alexandrov. Any finite simplicial complex in the sense talked about here can be embedded as a polytope in that sense, in some large number of dimensions. In algebraic topology, a compact topological space which is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a finite simplicial complex is usually called a polyhedron (see , , ).

==Combinatorics==
Combinatorialists often study the &quot;f&quot;-vector of a simplicial d-complex Δ, which is the integer sequence formula_26, where &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of (&quot;i&quot;−1)-dimensional faces of Δ (by convention, &quot;f&quot;0 = 1 unless Δ is the empty complex). For instance, if Δ is the boundary of the octahedron, then its &quot;f&quot;-vector is (1, 6, 12, 8), and if Δ is the first simplicial complex pictured above, its &quot;f&quot;-vector is (1, 18, 23, 8, 1). A complete characterization of the possible &quot;f&quot;-vectors of simplicial complexes is given by the Kruskal–Katona theorem.

By using the &quot;f&quot;-vector of a simplicial &quot;d&quot;-complex Δ as coefficients of a polynomial (written in decreasing order of exponents), we obtain the f-polynomial of Δ. In our two examples above, the &quot;f&quot;-polynomials would be formula_27 and formula_28, respectively.

Combinatorists are often quite interested in the h-vector of a simplicial complex Δ, which is the sequence of coefficients of the polynomial that results from plugging &quot;x&quot; − 1 into the &quot;f&quot;-polynomial of Δ. Formally, if we write &quot;F&quot;Δ(&quot;x&quot;) to mean the &quot;f&quot;-polynomial of Δ, then the h-polynomial of Δ is

:formula_29

and the &quot;h&quot;-vector of Δ is

:formula_30

We calculate the h-vector of the octahedron boundary (our first example) as follows:

:formula_31

So the &quot;h&quot;-vector of the boundary of the octahedron is (1, 3, 3, 1). It is not an accident this &quot;h&quot;-vector is symmetric. In fact, this happens whenever Δ is the boundary of a simplicial polytope (these are the Dehn–Sommerville equations). In general, however, the &quot;h&quot;-vector of a simplicial complex is not even necessarily positive. For instance, if we take Δ to be the 2-complex given by two triangles intersecting only at a common vertex, the resulting &quot;h&quot;-vector is (1, 3, −2).

A complete characterization of all simplicial polytope &quot;h&quot;-vectors is given by the celebrated g-theorem of Stanley, Billera, and Lee.

Simplicial complexes can be seen to have the same geometric structure as the contact graph of a sphere packing (a graph where vertices are the centers of spheres and edges exist if the corresponding packing elements touch each other) and as such can be used to determine the combinatorics of sphere packings, such as the number of touching pairs (1-simplices), touching triplets (2-simplices), and touching quadruples (3-simplices) in a sphere packing.

== Computational problems ==

The simplicial complex recognition problem is: given a finite simplicial complex, decide whether it is homeomorphic to a given geometric object. This problem is undecidable for any &quot;d&quot;-dimensional manifolds for &quot;d&quot; ≥ 5.

<text>Lester Garfield Maddox Sr. (September 30, 1915 – June 25, 2003) was an American politician who served as the 75th governor of Georgia from 1967 to 1971. A populist Southern Democrat, Maddox came to prominence as a staunch segregationist, when he refused to serve black customers in his Atlanta restaurant, the Pickrick, in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As he was ineligible to run for a second consecutive gubernatorial term, he sought and won election as lieutenant governor, serving alongside his successor as governor, Jimmy Carter.

==Childhood==
Maddox was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of nine children born to Dean Garfield Maddox, a steelworker, and his wife, the former Flonnie Castleberry. Maddox left school shortly before graduation to help support the family by taking odd jobs, including real estate and grocery. He received his high school diploma through correspondence courses. During World War II, Maddox worked at the Bell Aircraft factory in Marietta, Georgia producing the B-29 Superfortress bomber.

==Restaurant owner==
In 1944, Maddox, along with his wife Hattie Virginia (&quot;née&quot; Cox, 1918–1997), used $400 in savings to open a combination grocery store-and-restaurant called Lester&#x27;s Grill. Building on that success, the couple then bought property on Hemphill Avenue near the Georgia Institute of Technology campus to open up the Pickrick Restaurant.

Maddox made the Pickrick a family affair, with his wife and children also working with him. Known for its simple, inexpensive Southern cuisine, including its specialty, skillet-fried chicken, the Pickrick soon became a thriving business. The restaurant also provided Maddox with his first political forum. He placed advertising which featured cartoon chickens in the Atlanta newspapers. Following the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision of the United States Supreme Court, these restaurant ads began to feature the cartoon chickens commenting on the political questions of the day. However, Maddox&#x27;s refusal to adjust to changes following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 manifested itself when he filed a lawsuit to continue his segregationist policies. Maddox said that he would close his restaurant rather than serve African Americans. An initial group of black demonstrators came to the restaurant but did not enter when Maddox informed them that he had a large number of black employees. In April 1964, more African Americans attempted to enter the restaurant. Maddox confronted the group with a bare pickaxe handle. Maddox provides the following account of the events:

Mostly customers, with only a few employees, voluntarily removed the twelve Pickrick Drumsticks, (a euphemism for pickaxe handles) from the nail kegs on each side of the large dining room fireplace. They had been forewarned by the arrival of Atlanta&#x27;s news media of an impending attempted invasion of our restaurant by the racial demonstrators and once the demonstrators and agitators arrived, the customers and employees pulled the drumsticks (pickaxe handles) from the kegs and went outside to defend against the threatened invasion.

The &quot;invasion&quot; Maddox referred to was three black seminary students who had asked to be seated.

Maddox gained the approval of segregationists by leasing and then selling the restaurant to employees rather than agreeing to serve black customers. He claimed that the issue was not hostility to blacks, but constitutional property rights. He even built a monument to &quot;private property rights&quot; near the restaurant.

The Civil Rights Digital Library at the University of Georgia contains the following account of the closing of his restaurant:

Maddox closed the Pickrick on August 13 and reopened the business on September 26 as the Lester Maddox Cafeteria, where he pledged to serve only &quot;acceptable&quot; Georgians. During a trial for contempt of court on September 29, Maddox argued against the charges because he was no longer offering service to out-of-state travelers or integrationists. On February 5, 1965, a federal court ruled that Maddox was in contempt of court for failing to obey the injunction and assigned fines of two hundred dollars a day for failing to serve African Americans. Maddox ultimately closed his restaurant on February 7, 1965, rather than integrate it; he claimed that President Lyndon Johnson and communists put him out of business.

The building was purchased by Georgia Tech in 1965; it was used for many years as the placement center and was later known as the Ajax building. It was demolished in May 2009.

==Political career==

===Early campaigns===
During his ownership of the Pickrick, Maddox, a Democrat, failed in two bids for mayor of Atlanta. In 1957, he lost to incumbent William B. Hartsfield, for whom the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is named. Hartsfield had pursued a more moderate approach to racial issues. In 1961, Maddox lost to Ivan Allen, Jr., with whom he split the white vote. Allen&#x27;s ability to garner virtually all of the black vote provided his margin of victory.

In 1962, Maddox ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat, against Peter Zack Geer, a candidate with whom he shared segregationist and states&#x27; rights views. In an effort to differentiate themselves from each other, each attempted to paint the other as an extremist. Geer won the race, 55–45%, but Maddox gained attention across the state.

In the following years, Maddox proclaimed himself a &quot;Society of Liberty&quot; martyr intent on opposing a central government which thwarted states&#x27; rights and gave special protection to minority groups. He was recognized by his rimless eyeglasses, dome-shaped forehead, bald head, and nervous energy. It was said of Maddox, &quot;We have a populist revolution in its truest sense moving here. White people who work with their hands see in Lester Maddox a man of their own kind and are fighting to elect him [as governor].&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine termed Maddox a &quot;strident racist&quot;; &quot;Newsweek&quot; viewed him as a &quot;backwoods demagogue out in the boondocks&quot;. According to one account, the former restaurateur&#x27;s appeal transcended race to embrace a right-wing brand of &quot;populism&quot;, picturing government, rather than big business, as the villain.

===1966 election===

When Maddox sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1966, his principal primary opponent was former governor Ellis Arnall. That election was still in the era of Democratic Party dominance in Georgia, when winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to election. There was no Republican primary at the time, but there were voters who identified with the Republican Party. Republicans cast ballots in the open Democratic primary election, and some chose the candidate they believed would most likely lose the general election to their nominee, Howard &quot;Bo&quot; Callaway. In the primary, Arnall won a plurality of the popular vote, but he was denied the required majority. Maddox, the second-place candidate, entered the runoff election against Arnall. State senator Jimmy Carter finished in a strong third place. Again, some Republicans voted in the Democratic primary runoff. Arnall barely campaigned in the runoff, and Maddox emerged victorious, 443,055 to 373,004.

Maddox quipped that he had been nominated despite having &quot;no money, no politicians, no television, no newspapers, no Martin Luther King, no Lyndon Johnson, and we made it!&quot; He joked further that Johnson had been &quot;the best campaign manager I&#x27;ve got even if he did put me out of business&quot;, a reference to the closing of the Pickrick Restaurant to avoid desegregation. On winning the runoff, the Baptist Maddox, who neither smoked nor drank alcohol, described God as his &quot;campaign manager&quot;.

Stunned Arnall supporters announced a write-in candidacy for the general election, insisting that Georgians must have the option of a moderate Democrat beside the conservatives Maddox and Callaway. In his general election campaign, Maddox equated the Callaway Republicans to the American Civil War and the 1864 March to the Sea waged in Georgia by Union general William Tecumseh Sherman. He criticized the Callaway family textile mill, which he alleged had kept wages at $10 a week in Troup county. Maddox said that Callaway was unable to relate to farmers, small businessmen, and the unemployed: &quot;He would be a lot better off if he knew about people as well as dollars.&quot; Maddox said that Callaway Gardens had hired off-duty police officers to maintain segregation at the tourist park in Pine Mountain, but a superior court judge verified that Callaway had an open admission policy at the facility.

Callaway won a plurality in the general election, becoming the first Republican gubernatorial candidate to top the polls in Georgia since the close of Reconstruction, and Maddox finished second. More than 52,000 wrote in Arnall&#x27;s name. Under the election rules then in effect, the state legislature was required to elect one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes, which meant that the lawmakers could not consider Arnall. With the legislature overwhelmingly dominated by Democrats, all of whom had been required to sign a Democratic loyalty oath, Maddox became governor. He was sworn in on the evening of January 10, 1967, minutes after the legislature certified his election.

===Governor of Georgia===

Maddox campaigned hard for states&#x27; rights and maintained a segregationist stance while in office. Upon the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., he denied the slain civil rights leader the honor of lying in state in the Georgia state capitol after being told by undercover agents in the Atlanta Police Department that there was a planned storming of the state capitol by participants in the crowd of mourners. No evidence has ever emerged that this was anything more than a rumor; the undercover agents provided no evidence for it other than their statement. As a precaution, Maddox stationed 160 state troopers to surround the capitol. Regardless, the funeral procession, attended by tens of thousands; was entirely peaceful. Maddox called MLK an &quot;enemy of the people&quot; after his assassination and refused to attend his funeral. Maddox considered personally raising flags that had been placed at half-mast at the State Capitol after MLK&#x27;s assassination and reportedly decided against doing so because news cameras were nearby. In 1968, Maddox endorsed the former Democrat George Wallace, the then pro-segregation American Independent Party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. After leaving office, Maddox said &quot;“I’m still a segregationist. I’ve told you that 15 times. When are you going to start believing me?”

When he was asked what might be done to improve the abysmal conditions in Georgia prisons, Maddox replied that what was really needed was a better class of prisoner. Maddox&#x27;s chief of staff was Zell Miller, who went on to serve two terms as governor in the 1990s and as Paul Coverdell&#x27;s successor in the U.S. Senate. Maddox received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Bob Jones University in 1969.

In 1968, a small Atlanta repertory company produced a play entitled &quot;Red, White and Maddox&quot;. The play ridiculed Maddox and imagined him winning the 1972 U.S. presidential election, then starting a war with the Soviet Union. The show came to Broadway and ran for forty-one performances at the Cort Theatre before closing. Maddox was a supporter of the Vietnam War because of his anti-communist views, and he often told Georgia about the threats of communist and socialist influences.

====Accomplishments in office====

In the 1966 campaign, the &quot;Savannah Morning News&quot; forecast that as governor, Maddox would &quot;tell off the federal government forty times a day, but four years after his inauguration, he would have accomplished little else&quot;. Once in office, however, Maddox accomplished the following:

* Maddox was favorably influenced by Murray M. Silver, Esq., General Counsel of the Georgia Department of Labor, and Commissioner Sam Caldwell to hire blacks and to approve legislation affecting unemployment insurance of automobile workers within the state.
* Maddox integrated the Georgia State Patrol, appointed the first African American to head a state-wide government department, appointed the first African American Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, appointed the first African American to a draft board in Georgia, integrated Georgia&#x27;s farmer&#x27;s markets&#x27; lines, and directed state troopers not to address African Americans as &quot;niggers&quot;.
* Maddox introduced Little People&#x27;s Day where normal people could meet the governor twice a month. After 4 escaped African-American convicts met with him on Little People&#x27;s Day and informed him about terrible conditions in state prisons, Maddox launched an investigation of state prisons and ordered state prisons to make improvements.

Years after Maddox&#x27;s gubernatorial term ended, Republican Benjamin B. Blackburn described Maddox as a &quot;far better governor than his critics will ever admit&quot;. Blackburn, a former U.S. representative, also noted that no accusation of corruption was made against Maddox, whose administration was characterized by economic development and the appointment of African Americans to state executive positions.

===Lieutenant Governor of Georgia===
Under the Georgia constitution of 1945, Maddox was prohibited from running for a second consecutive term. He therefore waged his second bid for lieutenant governor, the first having resulted in defeat to Peter Zack Geer in 1962. Although Maddox was elected as a Democratic candidate at the same time as Jimmy Carter&#x27;s election as governor, the two were not running mates; in Georgia, particularly in that era of Democratic dominance, the winners of the primary elections went on to easy victories in the general elections without campaigning together as an official ticket or as running mates. Carter and Maddox found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.

Shortly after that election, Maddox appeared as a guest on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; on December 18, 1970. During a commercial break, fellow guest and former football player Jim Brown asked Maddox if he had &quot;any trouble with the white bigots because of all the things you did for blacks&quot;. On the air, Cavett substituted the word &quot;admirers&quot; in place of &quot;bigots&quot;, enraging Maddox. After demanding an apology from Cavett, and getting a carefully worded form of it, following further conversation, Maddox still walked off the show. Making light of the incident during a subsequent appearance by Maddox, Cavett walked off this time, and Maddox applauded.

Because the lieutenant governor was a mostly ceremonial role, Maddox spent most of his time as lieutenant governor preparing for a run for governor in 1974. Maddox was considered to be a near shoo-in to regain the governor&#x27;s mansion in 1974, with the &quot;New York Times&quot; predicting that only John Wayne could beat him for Georgia governor. However, Maddox was instead forced into a runoff for the Democratic nomination, where he was shockingly defeated by George Busbee.

===1976 presidential election===
When Carter ran for president in 1976, Maddox ran against him as the nominee of Wallace&#x27;s former American Independent Party, saying that his former rival was &quot;the most dishonest man I ever met&quot;. Maddox and running mate William Dyke, the former mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, received 170,373 votes in the election (less than 1% of the vote) and no electoral votes.

===Retirement===
With his political career seemingly over and with massive debts stemming from his 1974 gubernatorial bid, Maddox began a short-lived nightclub comedy career in 1977 with an African American musician, Bobby Lee Fears, who had worked as a busboy in his restaurant. Fears had served time in prison for a drug offense before Maddox, as lieutenant governor, was able to assist him in obtaining a pardon. Calling themselves &quot;The Governor and the Dishwasher,&quot; the duo performed comedy bits built around the Governor&#x27;s subjugation over the Dishwasher, the Dishwasher&#x27;s lack of intelligence, and musical numbers with Maddox on harmonica and Fears on guitar.

==Later years==

===1980s===
After Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down in 1983, with U.S. Representative Larry McDonald aboard, a special election was held to fill his seat in Congress. Lester Maddox stated his intention to run for the seat if McDonald&#x27;s wife, Kathy McDonald, did not. However, Kathy McDonald decided to run, and Maddox stayed out of the race; she lost to Democrat George &quot;Buddy&quot; Darden.

Maddox had been using drugs from a Bahamian cancer clinic to treat his prostate cancer. In July 1985, he revealed that the clinic had been shut down by Bahamian officials after its drugs had been found to be contaminated with the AIDS virus. Maddox underwent testing, and two months later announced that he was free of the virus.

During the 1987 Forsyth County protests in January of that year, Maddox attended a rally organized by members of the Ku Klux Klan after the group had attacked several dozen marchers who were protesting against racial discrimination in the county. J. B. Stoner, a white supremacist who had previously been imprisoned for bombing a black church in 1958, was also at the rally.

===1990s===
Maddox made one final unsuccessful bid for governor in 1990, then underwent heart surgery the following year. In the 1990 Democratic primary for governor, Maddox finished with about three percent of the vote. He remained a visible figure in his home community of Cobb County for the remainder of his life. In 1992 and 1996, Maddox crossed party lines and endorsed unsuccessful populist Republican Pat Buchanan for the presidency. His last public speech was in Atlanta in 2001 at the annual national conference of the Council of Conservative Citizens. The CCC, of which Maddox was a charter member, is considered by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League to be a white supremacist group.

==Personal life==
In 1935, Maddox married seventeen-year-old Hattie Virginia Cox. Maddox&#x27;s wife nursed him through all his illnesses and supported his political and business career, even though he had to spend much time away from the family.

===Death===
On June 25, 2003, after a fall while recuperating from intestinal surgery in an Atlanta hospice, Maddox died of complications from pneumonia and prostate cancer. He and his wife Virginia are both interred at Arlington Memorial Park in Sandy Springs in northern Fulton County, Georgia. Due to a successful business career, Maddox was relatively wealthy when he died.

==Legacy==
After Maddox&#x27;s death in 2003, Tom Murphy, the former Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, said of the former governor: &quot;He had a reputation as a segregationist, but he told us he was not a segregationist, but that you should be able to associate with whoever you wanted. He went on to do more for African Americans than any governor of Georgia up until that time.&quot; This view is not universally shared. In its obituary of the former governor, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him an &quot;arch segregationist&quot;; to support this contention, the &quot;Times&quot; noted that his convictions included &quot;the view that blacks were intellectually inferior to whites, that integration was a Communist plot, that segregation was somewhere justified in scripture and that a federal mandate to integrate [all-white] schools was &#x27;ungodly, un-Christian and un-American.&#x27;&quot; Despite this, the obituary notes that after becoming governor, Maddox &quot;surprised many by hiring and promoting blacks in state government and by initiating an early release program for the state prison system&quot;.

The Interstate Highway 75 bridge over the Chattahoochee River at the boundary of Cobb County (Vinings) and Fulton County (Atlanta), is named the &quot;Lester and Virginia Maddox Bridge&quot;.

Maddox was the primary inspiration for Randy Newman&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Rednecks&quot;.

<text>Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. () is an Italian car manufacturer and a subsidiary of Stellantis Europe, which is the European subsidiary of Stellantis. The present legal entity of Lancia was formed in January 2007 when its corporate parent reorganised its businesses, but its history is traced back to &quot;Lancia &amp; C.&quot;, a manufacturing concern founded in 1906 in Torino by Vincenzo Lancia (1881–1937) and Claudio Fogolin. It became part of Fiat in 1969.

The brand is known for its strong rallying heritage, and technical innovations such as the unibody chassis of the 1922 Lambda and the five-speed gearbox introduced in the 1948 Ardea. Despite not competing in the World Rally Championship since 1992, Lancia still holds more Manufacturers&#x27; Championships than any other brand.

Sales of Lancia-branded vehicles declined from over 300,000 annual units sold in 1990 to less than 100,000 by 2010. After corporate parent Fiat acquired a stake in Chrysler in 2009, the Lancia brand portfolio was modified to include rebadged Chrysler products, for sale in most European markets. In the United Kingdom and Ireland however, Lancias were rebadged as Chryslers. As sales continued to drop the Lancia-badged Chryslers were no longer offered after 2015. Since then, the company&#x27;s only product has been the Lancia Ypsilon, and sales outside of Italy ended in 2017. Despite Lancia&#x27;s much smaller brand presence, the Ypsilon continues to be popular in Italy; in fact it was the second best-selling car there in 2019.

The newly merged Franco-Italian-American company Stellantis stated that it would try to revive Italy&#x27;s Lancia, with the move also suggesting there would be more than one model for the brand, as well as sales outside of Italy for the first time in years.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===

Lancia &amp; C. Fabbrica Automobili was founded on 27 November 1906 in Turin by Fiat racing drivers, Vincenzo Lancia and his friend, Claudio Fogolin. The first car manufactured by Lancia was the &quot;Tipo 51&quot; or &quot;12 HP&quot; (later called &quot;Alfa&quot;), which remained in production from 1907 to 1908. It had a small four-cylinder engine with a power output of .

In 1910, Lancia components were exported to the United States where they were assembled and sold as SGVs by the SGV Company. In 1915, Lancia also manufactured its first truck, the Jota, that continued as a dedicated series. In 1937, Vincenzo died of a heart attack. His wife, Adele Miglietti Lancia, and his son, Gianni Lancia, took over control of the company. They persuaded Vittorio Jano to join as an engineer. Jano had already made a name for himself by designing various Alfa Romeo models, including some of its most successful race cars ever such as the 6C, P2 and P3.

Lancia is renowned in the automotive world for introducing cars with numerous innovations. These include the Theta of 1913, which was the first European production car to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment. Lancia&#x27;s first car adopting a monocoque chassis, the Lambda produced from 1922 to 1931, featured &#x27;Sliding Pillar&#x27; independent front suspension that incorporated the spring and hydraulic damper into a single unit (a feature that would be employed in subsequent Lancias, up to the Appia that was replaced in 1963). In 1948, the first 5-speed gearbox was fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia, after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first manufacturer to produce a V4 engine. Other innovations involved the use of independent suspension in production cars (in an era where live axles were common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car), and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia range. This drive for innovation, constant quest for excellence, fixation of quality, complex construction processes and antiquated production machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to rise, while flat demand eventually affected Lancia&#x27;s viability.

Gianni Lancia, a graduate engineer, was president of Lancia from 1947 to 1955. In 1956, the Pesenti family took control, with Carlo Pesenti in charge of the company.

===1969 to 2021===

Fiat launched a take-over bid in October 1969. It was accepted by Lancia as the company was losing significant sums of money, with losses in 1969 being 20 million. This was not the end of the distinctive Lancia marque, and new models in the 1970s such as the Stratos, Gamma and Beta proved that Fiat wished to preserve the image of the brand it had acquired. Autobianchi, bought by Fiat Group just a year before, was put under the control of Lancia.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Lancia had great success in rallying, winning many World Rally Championships.

During the 1980s, the company cooperated with Saab Automobile, with the Lancia Delta being sold as the Saab 600 in Sweden. The 1985 Lancia Thema also shared a platform with the Saab 9000, Fiat Croma and the Alfa Romeo 164. During the 1990s, all models were closely related to other Fiat models.

Starting from 1 February 2007, Fiat&#x27;s automotive operations were reorganised.
Fiat Auto became Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A., Fiat S.p.A.&#x27;s branch handling mainstream automotive production. Simultaneously the current company, &quot;Lancia Automobiles S.p.A.&quot;, was created from the pre-existing brand, and controlled 100% by FCA.
In 2011, Lancia moved in another direction and added new models manufactured by Chrysler and sold under the Lancia badge in many European markets, such as the 300 (named Thema), 200 Convertible (as Flavia) and Voyager. Conversely, Lancia-built models began to be sold in right-hand drive markets under the Chrysler badge.

In 2015 Lancia&#x27;s parent company Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. became FCA Italy S.p.A., reflecting the earlier incorporation of Fiat S.p.A. into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

After 2015, all models produced by Chrysler were discontinued in the European market. Since then, the Lancia brand has remained alive, only by continuing to manufacture and sell the Ypsilon - which received another slight facelift in 2020 - exclusively in the Italian market.

=== Since 2021 – Relaunch under Stellantis ===

Despite doubts about the brand&#x27;s future following the completion of the Stellantis merger in 2021, Lancia was made part of a joint group with sister companies Alfa Romeo and DS Automobiles, to develop new premium models for the 2024 model year. As part of Stellantis&#x27; recovery plan for Lancia, Luca Napolitano was appointed the car maker&#x27;s CEO, and Jean-Pierre Ploué its chief designer.

Three new electric models were announced in June 2021: a new subcompact car - which became the fourth generation of Ypsilon; a compact crossover (codenamed L74) - confirmed later in April 2023 as a five-door fastback CUV named Gamma, scheduled for a 2026 release; and a compact hatchback, likely to be a new Delta.

On November 28, 2022, Luca Napolitano laid the cornerstone of Lancia&#x27;s &quot;renaissance&quot; by revealing a new logo and introducing the new &quot;Pu+Ra&quot; (Pure + Radical) Design language - through a sculpture called Pu+Ra Zero. Inspired by historic models such as the Aurelia, Flaminia, Delta and the 1970 Stratos Zero concept car, future electric models will be adorned by both organic lines and geometric shapes at the same time. The iconic &quot;calice&quot; grille was reinterpreted as a new Y-shaped LED light signature, with the new wordmark above them, instead of the shield. At the rear, round taillights pays homage directly to the Stratos sports car. All these design shapes were later applied into a fully-functional concept car: the Lancia Pu+Ra HPE Concept presented on 15 April 2023 in Milan.

On 12 December 2023, a prototype of the fourth generation of Ypsilon was found at the deep of a canal in the Montbeliard region, France, close to a Stellantis&#x27; plant in Sochaux; unveiling its final design few months before the official unveil. The model had been presumed stolen during development testing rides before the sinking.

On 14 February 2024, Lancia officially launches the fourth generation of Ypsilon, first under a limited production edition called &quot;Ypsilon Edizione Limitata Cassina&quot;, codeveloped between Lancia and Italian high-end furniture manufacturer Cassina S.p.A.. Production of the model is capped at 1,906 units, the amount referencing Lancia&#x27;s foundation in 1906.

The Lancia Ypsilon dominated the Italian market in the first months of 2024, recording exceptional numbers for the brand. Concluding the first quarter with 12,923 units sold, up 16.4% compared to the same period in 2023.

In May 2024, Lancia announced the revival of the HF performance division, unveiling an all-new Ypsilon HF version, to be launched in May 2025, alongside a Rally4 version of the same model, signaling an (initially limited) return to rally championships.

As of July 2024, Lancia Ypsilon closed the first half of 2024 with 24,709 units sold, with a 3% increase in volumes and a market share of 2.8%, in line with last year&#x27;s performance, confirming itself as one of the best-selling cars in its segment.
On July 18, 2024, the first new Lancia Ypsilon is finally delivered.
As of August 2024, the new Lancia Ypsilon sold in the Italian market 1.362.
As of September 2024, the new Lancia Ypsilon sold in the Italian market 1.055.
While in October 2024 the data further decreased with only 805 registered cars.
As of November 2024. Lancia Ypsilon car sales are only 812 units in the Italian market.

However, it must be considered that the car has only been on the market for a few months in an unfavorable market context, dominated by the difficulties of the electric transition in addition to having only one model in production for Lancia. In this context, Lancia will close the year 2024, if massive incentives and tax breaks do not intervene with sales of approximately 30,000 units only for italian market.
Among the positive factors to consider for 2024, the expansion of Lancia dealers on the European market and beyond, while in previous years it was only present on the Italian market, and the future expansion of the range with the new planned models of Lancia Gamma and Lancia Delta. Furthermore, Lancia&#x27;s return to Rally competitions will certainly benefit sales and the relaunch of the brand.

In 1999, Lancia made a one-off limousine version of the Kappa and at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show, Stola showed a limousine version of the Thesis.

In January 2014, in an interview with &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne foreshadowed that Lancia would become an Italy–only brand, and focus only on the Ypsilon supermini range. However, in 2024, the brand began to be exported to other markets again.

===France===
In August 2024, Stellantis &amp; You, a subsidiary of the Stellantis group dedicated to automobile distribution in Europe, has opened the very first Lancia point of sale located in La Défense, near Paris.

===United States===
While some models had been imported on a small scale during the 1950s to the 1960s, Lancias were sold in the United States from 1975. Sales were comparatively slow, and the range was withdrawn at the same time as Fiat in 1982.

In 2009, following Fiat&#x27;s acquisition of a stake in United States–based Chrysler and part of Chrysler&#x27;s restructuring plans, it was stated that Fiat plans for the Chrysler brand and Lancia to co–develop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia&#x27;s CEO, took over as CEO of the Chrysler division in October 2009. Fiat also announced that, depending on the market, some Chrysler cars would be sold as Lancias and vice versa.

Francois&#x27; plans to re-establish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand were somewhat muddied by the discontinuance of the Plymouth brand. At the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, a Chrysler-badged Lancia Delta was on display, but this did not result in sales in the United States, with proposals to instead modify an Alfa Romeo for sale by 2013.

===United Kingdom===
Lancia&#x27;s reputation was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension sub-frame corrosion problems, were purchased back from owners by the company in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were later crushed. The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall and, combined with a range of related factors (including poor residual values, which made their range uncompetitive), decided to withdraw from the United Kingdom (and other right-hand drive markets) in February 1994. The last model to be sold in the United Kingdom was the Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation, withdrawn from sale in 1995, although a small number of left-hand drive Lancia models have since reached the UK as personal imports.

After 1995, there were continuous rumours suggesting Lancia&#x27;s return to the United Kingdom. In November 2005, &quot;What Car?&quot; reported rumours over the alleged return, to rival &quot;affordable&quot; premium makes, such as Saab and Volvo. In September 2006, &quot;What Car?&quot; reported that Lancia were returning to the United Kingdom. The relaunch date was set for August 2008. In April 2008, &quot;Car&quot; reported that Lancia had postponed the relaunch. In June 2009, &quot;Autocar&quot; reported that the relaunch of Lancia was now “very unlikely”.

These rumours were credible since Lancia models, by that time, shared common parts with Fiat and Alfa Romeo models that were imported, sold and maintained by an existing dealership network. The cost to reestablish the brand would therefore be minimal. In December 2008, however, Fiat cancelled relaunch plans, due to financial concerns coinciding with the global financial crisis, and the recession.

In 2011, Lancia Ypsilon and Delta models were eventually reintroduced to the United Kingdom, but were sold under the Chrysler marque. In January 2014, the slow-selling Delta model was dropped from this line-up. In March 2015, Fiat Group announced that the Chrysler brand would be discontinued in the United Kingdom in 2017, citing a desire to focus largely on the Jeep brand instead.

===Japan===
A small number of Lancia models were previously sold in Japan, such as Fulvia, Stratos and Delta. More recently, some models have been sold under the Chrysler brand, such as the Ypsilon.

==Lancia in motorsport==
===Formula One===

After Vincenzo Lancia&#x27;s son Gianni became director of the firm, it started to take part more frequently in motorsport, eventually deciding to build a Grand Prix car. Vittorio Jano was the new designer for Lancia and his Lancia D50 was entered into the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix, where Alberto Ascari took the pole position and drove the fastest lap. In the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix Ascari crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. One week later Ascari was killed in an accident driving a Ferrari sports car at Monza. With Ascari&#x27;s death and Lancia&#x27;s financial problems the company withdrew from Grand Prix racing. Altogether Lancia took two victories and ten podiums in Formula One.

Remnants of the Lancia team were transferred to Scuderia Ferrari, where Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1956 championship with a Lancia-Ferrari car.

===Rallying===
Lancia has been very successful in motorsport over the years, and mostly in the arena of rallying. Prior to the forming of the World Rally Championship (WRC), Lancia took the final International Championship for Manufacturers title with the Fulvia in 1972. In the WRC, they remain the most statistically successful marque (despite having withdrawn at the end of the 1993 season), winning constructors&#x27; titles with the Stratos (1974, 1975 and 1976), the 037 (1983) and the Delta (six consecutive wins from 1987 to 1992). The Delta is also the most successful individual model designation ever to compete in rallying. All this gave Lancia a total of 11 Championships over the years and 15 European Championship from 1969 to 1992.

Juha Kankkunen and Miki Biasion both won two drivers&#x27; titles with the Delta. Among other drivers to take several World Rally Championship wins with Lancia were Markku Alén, Didier Auriol, Sandro Munari, Bernard Darniche, Walter Röhrl, Björn Waldegård and Henri Toivonen. The history of the brand in rallying is also tainted with tragedy, with deaths of Italian driver Attilio Bettega at the 1985 Tour de Corse in a Lancia 037 and then Finnish championship favourite Toivonen in a Lancia Delta S4 at the same rally exactly a year later. These deaths would eventually lead to the end of Group B rallying.

===Sports car racing===

In 1951 Mille Miglia, Lancia Aurelia B20 GT came second overall. .

In 1953, Umberto Maglioli won the Targa Florio at the wheel of the Lancia D20. The same year Lancia introduced the D24 sports racer, which was an evolution of D23 model, but rebodied as a spider by Pinin Farina. Its most significant victories were the 1953 Carrera Panamericana, the 1954 Mille Miglia and the 1954 Targa Florio.
During Lancia&#x27;s dominance of rallying, the company also expanded into sports cars in the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. It first ran the Stratos HF in Group 4, and for a brief interlude with a rare Group 5 version. The car was replaced with the successful Beta Montecarlo Turbo winning the FIA&#x27;s 1980 World Championship for Makes and 1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes and the 1980 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft.
In 1982 the team moved up to Group 6 with the LC1 Spyder, followed by the Group C LC2 coupé which featured a Ferrari powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting Porsche 956 in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime; however, its results were hampered by poor reliability and fuel economy, and it only managed to win three European and World Endurance Championship races. The team&#x27;s inability to compete against the dominant Porsche 956 and 962 sports cars led it to drop out of sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.

==Commercial vehicles==
Lancia produced a wide range of vans, trucks, buses and military vehicles from the beginning, forming Lancia Veicoli Industriali in 1912. Lancia slowly withdrew from the commercial sectors during the late 1960s and production of commercial vehicles ended in the early 1970s, shortly after Fiat&#x27;s takeover of the company, with some models transferred to Iveco.

==Logo==
;1907
From 1907 to 1910 Lancia cars didn&#x27;t bear a true badge, but rather a brass plaque identifying the manufacturer (Lancia &amp; C.) and chassis code; although some models did have a brass Lancia script on the grille.

;1911
The original Lancia logo was designed by Count Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia.
In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia to design a badge for the company: the Count submitted six watercolour proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue lance and flag bearing a Lancia script (&quot;Lancia&quot; means &quot;lance&quot; in Italian) in gold, over a four-spoke steering wheel, with a hand throttle detail on the right spoke. The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the Gamma 20 HP in 1911.

;1929
In 1929 the logo acquired its final layout: the previous round badge was superimposed on a blue shield in the shape of a Reuleaux triangle (as found in one of Biscaretti di Ruffia&#x27;s six original proposals). Though first applied on the 1929 Dikappa, this badge was only used consistently starting with the 1936 Aprilia.

;1957
Beginning with the 1957 Flaminia, Lancia cars switched from the traditional vertical split grille to a horizontal, full-width one. The logo was moved inside the grille opening, and changed to a more stylized chromed metal open-work design; shield and steering wheel became chrome frames, the only remaining enameled surface being the blue field of the flag. This new metal logo was used on most models with some exceptions, namely Zagato-bodied Lancia Fulvias and Flavias, the Lancia 2000 Berlina (which reprised the traditional upright grille and the round enameled badge) and the Stratos HF (whose ornaments lacked the triangular shield).

;1974
In 1974 the badge was redesigned on Umberto Agnelli&#x27;s request; it went back to a modernised silver, white and blue version of the 1929 design. Flag and lance were unified in a single shape and dispensed with the earlier minute detailing, the Lancia letters became all of the same size, and the steering wheel became also outlined in blue and lost the hand throttle detail. This logo debuted on the 1979 Lancia Delta, and made its way on the other models as they adopted the split grille introduced by the Delta. Though lightly revised in 2000 with the addition of a chrome shield surround, the 1974 logo was used through four decades, up to 2006.

;2007
A redesigned logo, designed by Robilant Associati, was presented at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show—a couple of months after the creation of Lancia Automobiles. While the traditional chrome-framed blue shield has been retained and made three-dimensional, for the first time since 1911 lance and flag are absent; the steering wheel has been stylized into a chromed circle, from which two spikes converge towards the modern Lancia logotype in the centre.

;2022
The current logo was unveiled in late 2022, as part of Lancia&#x27;s newest design language dubbed &quot;Pu+Ra&quot;. The logo retains the colour scheme of the 2007 logo, while also reinstating and streamlining the flag, circle and lance theme of the 1957 logo.
==Media and sponsorship==

In 2009, the British motoring television show &quot;Top Gear&quot; suggested that Lancia had more &#x27;great&#x27; models than any other car company. The presenters went on to test the Gamma Coupé, Fulvia Coupé, Aprilia, Montecarlo, Beta Coupé, HPE, Stratos, 037, Delta Integrale Evo II and Thema 8.32. They also stated during their review that Lancia made the best-looking cars, even though they are unreliable.

Lancia sponsored the Venice Film Festival for five years, ending in 2012, with the Lancia Thema used to transport stars to the festival. Lancia was sponsor of the ninth and eleventh World Summits of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates.

<text>The Saab 900 is a mid-sized automobile produced by Swedish manufacturer Saab from 1978 until 1998 in two generations: the first from 1978 to 1994, and the second from 1994 to 1998.

The first-generation car was based on the Saab 99 chassis, though with a longer front end to meet U.S. frontal crash regulations and to make room for the turbo-charged engines, air conditioning and other equipment that was not available in the early days of the 99 model. The 900 was produced in 2- and 4-door sedan, and 3- and 5-door hatchback configurations and, from 1986, as a cabriolet (convertible) model. There were single- and twin-Zenith carburettor; fuel injected, and turbocharged engines, including Full Pressure Turbo (FPT) and, in European models during the early 1990s, Low Pressure Turbos (LPT).

== Saab 900 &quot;Classic&quot; ==

The 900 was originally introduced on 12 May 1978, for the 1979 model year. Sales commenced in the fall of 1978. It has a longitudinally mounted, 45-degree canted, inline four-cylinder engine, double wishbone front suspension and beam-axle rear suspension.

Like its predecessor, the 900 contained a number of unusual design features that distinguish it from most other cars. First, the B-engine, that was installed &quot;backwards&quot;, with power delivered from the crank at the front of the car. Second, the transmission, technically a transaxle, bolted directly to the bottom of the engine to form the oil pan (albeit with separate oil lubrication). Thus, power from the crank would be delivered out of the engine at the front, then transferred down and back to the transmission below, via a set of chain-driven primary gears. In similar fashion, Minis also had their gearbox mounted directly below the engine; however, the Mini gearbox and engine shared the same oil, whereas the gearboxes used by Saab contained a separate sump for engine oil.

The body was developed from the older 99 model, keeping the basic layout but with a new longer front-end. This allowed for more space in the engine bay and better crash protection for passengers. The middle and rear parts of the body were identical to those of the 99 Combi Coupé (which was withdrawn from the lineup at the same time). Later a new rear end was designed for the 2-door and 4-door sedans. In the early 1980s, most 900s were produced in Trollhättan. However, coinciding with the introduction of the 9000, most of the 900&#x27;s production took place elsewhere. The Valmet plant in Finland also produced the base models of the 900, a total of 238,898 examples. The plant in Arlöv (now closed), near Malmö, also produced the car. 

Refined over several decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900&#x27;s double wishbone suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel. The rear suspension comprised a typical beam axle design, stabilized with a Panhard rod. However, the attachment points between the axle and chassis made up an unusual configuration that, in essence, consists of two Watt&#x27;s linkages at either end of the axle: A lower control arm attaches the axle to the bottom of the vehicle, while an upper link attaches at the top but faces towards the rear, unlike a typical four-link design with both lower and upper links facing forward.
The design-principle being similar with the rear suspension presented in Alfa Romeo Alfasud already in 1971, except in the Alfasud, the beam axle itself functioned as a sway-bar, hence separate sway-bars in the rear suspension were not needed.



The 900 underwent minor cosmetic design changes for 1987, including a restyled front end and bumpers that went from a vertical to a more sloped design. To save money, Saab kept the basic undercarriage more or less unchanged throughout the 900&#x27;s production run.

The Saab 900 could be ordered with different options, including a high performance option called the &quot;Aero&quot; or, as it was known in the U.S. &quot;Special Performance Group&quot; (SPG). The Aero/SPG incorporated (depending on the market and model year) a body skirt; a sport-suspension (1987 onwards) that included shorter, stiffer springs, stiffer shocks, and sway bars; leather seats; premium stereo; and air conditioning. Each of these features could also be ordered independently from Saab&#x27;s Accessories Catalog for fitment to standard models.

Another UK option at this time was the fitment of Minilite alloy wheels. Initially these had the words &#x27;Minilite&#x27; and &#x27;Saab&#x27; cast in raised lettering; later cars had similar wheel made by Ronal.

Power output varied by model year and market, but 900S and 900 Turbo models produced from 1985 and onward were fitted with a 16-valve engine, while the base 900 models kept the earlier 8-valve engine.

A 1989 Saab 900 SPG, owned by Peter Gilbert of Wisconsin, was driven over a million miles before being donated to The Wisconsin Automotive Museum. Peter Gilbert claimed a million miles out of the turbocharging unit in addition to the engine itself. Saab gave Mr Gilbert a Saab 9-5 Aero.

=== History ===

The 900 in 1979 was available in three versions of the B-engine: The GL had the single-carb engine, the GLs had twin carburettors rated at , the EMS and GLE had Bosch jetronic fuel injection rated , and the 900 Turbo was rated at . The Turbo had a different grille from the naturally aspirated models, which received a design with a hexagonal central element. The only bodywork originally available was the three or five-door hatchback, which was seen as more modern at the time. The EMS was only available with three doors while the automatic-equipped GLE was only offered with five. Saab&#x27;s model years were generally introduced in August/September of the preceding year.

In the most important foreign market, the USA, the model range was different, mainly due to the omission of carburettor engines due to the stricter emissions regulations in force. The Saab 900 was introduced only with two engines: the fuel injected version of , producing in Western and Rocky Mountain states, and the Turbo with . Engine performance was lower than in other markets due to emissions regulations. The body shapes included three-door GLi, EMS and 900 Turbo variants, along with the 900 GLE and Turbo 5-doors. An optional automatic transmission was available on all models except the Turbos. 

For the 1980 model year, all versions in all markets received the sleeker turbo-style grille. The 900 also received larger taillights rather than the earlier units shared with the 99, as well as lower, adjustable head restraints. 1980 was also the first year for a five-speed gearbox, originally only available in the EMS and the Turbo. By 1980 in the US, all naturally-aspirated models were now powered by the , &quot;Lambda&quot; emission control engine which required unleaded fuel only. 1980 was also the last model year for the Saab 99 in the US market.

First shown during the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, Saab introduced for the MY 1981 a new body style: a 4-door sedan. With the introduction of the new 4-door sedan, the country importers finally decided which models and in which forms they wanted to offer the 900 in their respective markets. So not all engine and body variants were offered in every country. A policy that Saab maintained in the following years and makes generalization impossible. The information here on individual models and engines depending on the model year is therefore only indicative. While the new body shape complemented the model range in all markets, it replaced the 5-door variant in the U.S. The introduction went along with a considerable boost in equipment (except the base model &quot;GL&quot;) as well as broader side trims, larger luggage compartments and fuel tanks on all models. Another big change: the spare tyre was moved to underneath the floor, rather than standing upright in the luggage compartment (this was the case again with the later introduced convertible).

With the introduction of the new 4-door body type for MY 1981, Saab simplified the model designation on the international markets (with the exception of the US): GL for the model with the single carburettor (with 3, 4, or 5 doors), GLs for the models with the twin carburettor engine (also with 3, 4, or 5 doors), GLi as designation for the models with fuel injection (with 3 or 4 doors), and the GLE was now offered as a better equipped GLi only as four-door Sedan. Top of the range was the &quot;Turbo&quot; with the corresponding engine (with 3, 4, or 5 doors). The EMS designation was dropped. In the USA the simplification went even further: &quot;900&quot; for the base model with the 110 hp (81 kW) 8V mechanical Bosch injection engine, &quot;900 S&quot; with the same engine, but better equipment, and &quot;900 TURBO&quot; with the 8V Turbo 135 PS (100 kW) engine. Since 1980 engines in the US were always equipped with catalytic converters. All models were available only as 3- or 4-door type.

Also a big change underneath the bonnet for MY 1981 was the evolution of the old &quot;B engine&quot; to the new &quot;H engine&quot; (which was retained until the end of the 900 series in 1994). The H engine was simplified compared to the old engine design, making it more robust and lighter and, according to Saab, should also reduce fuel consumption. The power output remained the same in all variants as the B engine. Characteristics of the new engine type: no countershaft, ignition distributor driven directly by the camshaft. It is assumed that Saab used up old B engine blocks in the Saab 99, so the new engine layout was not officially introduced in the 99 until the MY 82. 

A big change for 1982 was the introduction of Saab&#x27;s Automatic Performance Control (APC), a.k.a. boost controller for the turbo models. The APC employed a knock sensor, allowing the engine to use different grades of gasoline without engine damage. Another new feature that year was the introduction of central locking doors (on the GLE and Turbo). The long-wheelbase 900 CD was also introduced. Asbestos-free brakes were introduced in 1983, an industry first. The front pads were semi-metallic while the rears were made from silica. The GLE model gained a new central console, while the decor strips on the bumpers of all models were made wider (necessitating wider trim pieces on the flanks as well). A new luxury package was made available on Turbo models.

Model year 1984 in Europe saw the introduction of the 16-valve DOHC &quot;B202&quot; engine (introduced in the US in 1985). With a turbocharger and intercooler, it was rated at in the Turbo 16 model (less for catalyst-equipped engines) without catalytic converter ( with cat). The Turbo 16 Aero (designated SPG, Special Performance Group in North American Markets) had a body kit allowing the car to attain speeds up-to . A different grille and a three-spoke steering wheel appeared across all models. The connection between the side strips and the bumpers was changed, Turbo hatchbacks received a black trim piece between the taillights, and the GLi began replacing the twin-carburetted GLs. At the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show a two-door sedan was shown; it went on sale in January 1984, initially only as a GLi. The 2-door was only ever built at the Valmet plant in Finland.

In the 1985 model year, Saab deleted the 2-carburettor engine and simplified the naming again. The entry-level model with the single carburettor was only called &quot;900&quot; and the models with the 8V injection engine were called &quot;900i&quot;. Depending on the market, models with the 8V Turbo engine were simply called either &quot;900 Turbo&quot;. Models with the 16V turbo engine were called &quot;900 Turbo 16&quot; or (with special equipment &quot;900 Turbo 16 S&quot;).
The nomenclature GL and GLs was discontinued from 1985 onwards. Now, the base 900 had the single-carburettor engine. Two turbocharged models were offered: The 900 Turbo had the 8-valve engine, while the Turbo 16 (also Aero) had the 16-valve intercooled unit. Wheel trims (naturally aspirated cars) and alloys (turbos) were redesigned, and the Turbos also received chromed grilles. The 8-valve turbo received an intercooler for 1986, bringing up power to , while the 16-valve cars had hydraulic engine mounts. The eight-valve Turbo was also available as a two-door. Side marker lights at the rear of the front fenders were also added, while the 900i gained new interior fabrics. The new Saab-Scania badge was introduced, placed in the steering wheel, on the bonnet, and on the bootlid. 1986 also marked the introduction of the 16-valve 900i 16 and 900 convertible, both only for North America initially.

==== 1987 facelift ====
A new grille, headlamps, front turn signal lights and &quot;integrated&quot; bumpers freshened the 900&#x27;s look for 1987, though the sheetmetal was largely unchanged. Several common parts for the 900 and 9000 were introduced for 1988 model year, including brakes and wheel hubs. This also meant that Saab finally abandoned the use of parking brakes on the front wheels, in favor of the rear wheels. Power steering was added on the 900i. The base 900, available with two or four doors, kept the pre-facelift appearance for 1987. Also new was the carburetted 900c. The Aero model received slightly bigger fender extensions so as to accommodate larger wheels, while the window trim was blacked out on all models. For 1988 catalytic converters became available with all fuel injected engines in Europe, all with cruise control as standard equipment to further help lower emissions. A water- and oil-cooled turbocharger (replacing the older oil-cooled unit) was also introduced to improve the unit&#x27;s durability.

In each of the seasons 1987 and 1988, there was a special &#x27;one-make&#x27; race series, in the UK, called the Saab Turbo Mobil Challenge, sponsored by Saab Great Britain and Mobil. It was run by the BARC.

The eight-valve engines were phased out in 1989 and 1990, with the turbo versions taken off North American markets by the end of 1984; North American 900S models received the non-turbo 16-valve engine for 1986. A non-turbo 16-valve engine replaced the 8-valve FI unit in the 900i (900S in North America) as well, while the carbureted engines were dropped. In Europe the eight-valve Turbo dropped out with the 1989 model year, with the limited production 900 T8 Special built to celebrate end of production. 805 were built for Sweden, featuring Aero trim and equipment. The 900i 16 arrived in Europe, with . Anti-lock brakes were introduced as well, and were standard on Turbo models. High-mounted rear brake lights appeared during 1988, and power of the catalyzed Turbo 16 Aero jumped from .

Larger pinion bearings were fitted to manual gearboxes for 1989 to improve their strength and reliability. For 1990, the eight-valve engine was taken out of production while a low-pressure turbo engine with was available in European markets. ABS brakes and driver&#x27;s side airbags were standardized for all North American market cars beginning with the 1990 model year. In the spring of 1990 the naturally aspirated 900i 16 Cabriolet was added.

A (B212) engine, bored out by , was introduced in 1991. This engine was available in the United States until the end of the original 900, but in most of Europe, this engine saw limited availability because of tax regulations in many European countries for engines with a displacement of more than 2000 cc. In Sweden, the 2.1-16 was introduced in late summer 1991 for the 1992 model year and had rather than the of the 2.0. The 2.1 was made standard fitment on the naturally aspirated Cabriolet, except in markets where the tax structure did not suit it. Front seats from the 9000 were standard from 1991 on and electronically adjustable units were available as an option. Airbags became available as an option in Europe as well, while there was also an Aero trim of the Cabriolet. The 900 no longer offered the mesh wheels. There was also a change in the door locks, which carried over to the 900NG.

For 1992 there were mostly equipment adjustments, with ABS brakes finding their way into most of the lineup everywhere. 1993 brought no changes, and &quot;classic&quot; 900 production ended on 26 March 1993. The final classic convertibles were still sold as 1994 models. Production of the 900 &quot;classic&quot; totaled 908,817 units, including 48,888 convertibles.

Influenced by then owner General Motors (GM), in 1994 Saab introduced the New Generation (NG) 900 SE, based on the Opel Vectra chassis. While this design contained styling cues reminiscent of the &quot;classic&quot; 900, the 900 (NG) was fundamentally a different car.

=== Convertible ===
In the mid-1980s, the president of Saab-Scania of America (U.S. importer owned by Saab AB), Robert J. Sinclair, suggested a convertible version to increase sales. The first prototype was built by ASC, American Sunroof Company (now American Specialty Cars). Similarly, Lynx Motors International Ltd produced two cars, just prior to the official 1986 launch.

The Trollhättan design department, headed by Björn Envall, based its version on the 3-door hatchback while the Finnish plant used the sturdier 2-door sedan version, with the latter being selected for production as it was deemed more attractive. A limited production run was initially planned but due to the high influx of orders, production was extended.

The new car was shown for the first time at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in the autumn of 1983. The first prototype generated enormous interest and in April 1984, Saab decided to put the car in production at Valmet Automotive in Finland. The production of the first 900 convertible started during the spring of 1986.

The convertible usually had a 16-valve turbocharged engine, with some trim levels equipped with the intercooler, but it was also offered in certain markets with a fuel-injected 2.1 L naturally aspirated engine from 1991 onwards.

The cabriolet/convertible, was made on the &#x27;classic&#x27; chassis for an additional year after the discontinuation of the 900 Classic in 1994.

In US and Canadian markets, commemorative versions were produced for 1994 featuring special charcoal metallic &quot;Nova Black&quot; paint, wooden trim for the dashboard, black leather piping on the seats and higher-performing engines.

=== Engine development ===
Saab introduced a turbocharger in 1978 in its 99 Turbo with the B engine (based on the Triumph Slant-4 engine). This engine was also used in early 900 Turbo models.

For 1981 the B-engine was re-designed as the H engine, which was used through to 1993 (and 1994 cabriolets). Unlike the earlier version, the H-engine is very durable. Saab used Bosch-made mechanical K-Jetronic continuous fuel injection in the fuel injected and 8-valve turbocharged versions, and the Bosch LH 2.2, 2.4 and 2.4.2 and Lucas Automotive electronic fuel injection systems were used in the 16-valve versions. The 2.1 L inline-four 16-valve engine used the Bosch LH 2.4.2 EZK electronic ignition system with a knock sensor. 1981 was also the first year that the Turbo was available with an automatic transmission. The four-speed manual option disappeared after this year.

What set the 900 Turbo apart from its turbo-equipped competitors, especially in the early- and mid-1980s, was the development and use of the &quot;Automatic Performance Control&quot; (APC) boost controller from 1982. The system allowed the engine to run at the limits of engine knocking. The system had a knock sensor attached to the intake side of the engine block and if knocking of any kind was present, the APC-system would decrease the charge pressure by opening a wastegate, a bypass to the exhaust. This enabled the use of various octane fuels and also made the use of the turbocharger safer for the engine. Some 900 Aeros, Carlssons and Commemorative Editions had special APC controllers in red and black enclosures that provided more boost and increased power to or without a catalytic converter. By 1983, Saab had sold 100,000 turbo-charged cars.

At first, Saab used a Garrett T3 turbocharger, which was oil-cooled. From 1988 through 1990, water-cooled T3s were fitted. In 1990, Saab fitted Mitsubishi TE-05 turbochargers in the SPG models only for the US; for other countries, and for the US from 1991, all 900 Turbos were fitted with the TE-05. Also water-cooled, the TE-05 was slightly smaller than the Garrett T3, providing improved throttle response and quicker spool-up. The TE-05&#x27;s exhaust inlet flange utilizes a Garrett T3 pattern.

=== Special models ===

==== 900 GLi Gold ====
The Gold special edition was available in the UK in 1981 as the first 900 4-door saloons; these had turbo-spec velour interior finished in either blue or black with gold pinstripes, twin air vent bonnet and fuel gauge showing tank contents in litres.

==== 900 Tjugofem ====
The &quot;Tjugofem&quot; (&quot;Twenty-five&quot; in Swedish) Saloon introduced to celebrate Saab&#x27;s 25th year in the UK. Only 300 units were built. These had the 1,985 cc 8-Valve engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Interior trim was blue turbo velour with a special gear knob with the car&#x27;s number. Outside, the model was a standard non-turbo apart from alloy wheels, Tjugofem pinstriping and Turbo style rear spoiler.

==== 900c ====
The 900c was built in Uusikaupunki, Finland and in Arlöv, Sweden just outside Malmö, was a late 1980s carburetted model. It used an eight-valve B201 engine with a single carburettor rated at and included power steering as standard equipment.

==== 900 Aero/T16S or 900 SPG ====

In 1984, Saab introduced a high-performance model known in Europe as the Aero. In North America, the model designation became SPG (Special Performance Group – per Saab USA&#x27;s own literature – SAAB data correctly refers to it as Sports PacKage) due to a model and trademark conflict with GM in English speaking countries and the US. In the UK it was known as the T16S. The Aero/SPG was the first Saab to be delivered with the 16-valve turbocharged engine. 

The most notable difference from the 900 Turbo was the body kit that wrapped around the car and the specialty wheels. The engine was tuned to produce higher output. The SPG also had a lowered and stiffer suspension.

These prototypes were painted a mother of pearl white and had red leather interiors with matching Colorado Red dashboards. Unfortunately, during testing, the colour was found to be too difficult to repair in terms of color, and as such, this color was never offered to the public for sale. Only 29 of these prototype Aero/SPGs were manufactured. The factory retained, and subsequently destroyed, 22 of the white prototypes. The remaining seven vehicles were employed as press vehicles for the series launch. 

In 1984, the first year of consumer production, the Aero/SPG was delivered in black and in silver (in markets other than US). In Australia the 1985 models painted in silver colour had a dark red leather interior. In the US, cars painted in black colour were featured tan leather interiors. In Canada and in the rest of the world, the cars were black with red leather interiors. Production of the SPG was extremely limited and paint color availability varied by year. The final year of production was 1991 in the US. In total, over the course of six years, 7,625 SPGs were built and imported to North America. In the rest of the world, Aeros were equally rare—especially those equipped with leather interiors, A/C and other amenities.

==== 900EP (900S) ====
The EP was a special Ecopower model for the Italian market. It uses a 16 valve low pressure turbo (LPT) engine and has a pre-heated catalytic converter. It was sold outside Italy with a 900S badge.

====900 CD====

In 1977 Saab&#x27;s Finnish subsidiary Saab-Valmet (Today Valmet Automotive) had created an elongated executive model of the 99 combi coupé named Finlandia. With the introduction of the 900, the concept was transferred onto the new chassis. The Finlandia was 20 cm (7.9 in) longer than standard, by adding 10 cm (3.9 in) to the front and rear doors, but only the rear leg room was larger. The idea behind the car was to produce an executive car which would appeal to the Nordic market as an option to big German and US sedans. The first cars were sold as the Saab 900 Finlandia. These cars made between 1979 and 1982 were combi coupés, and did not have the &#x27;CD&#x27; designation. Very few examples of these early models were exported outside of Finland. After the more elegant 4-door sedan was introduced, the CD designation replaced the nickname and the Swedish Saab headquarters started to officially offer the car for export. The 900 CD was made at the Valmet Automotive factory in Uusikaupunki, Finland. At least in the domestic market, the cars were essentially built to the buyer’s wishes. The list of optional extras for the CD included a leather interior, reading lights, rear blinds, footrests, and even an in-car telephone. However, due to the cars’ special nature and demanding customer base, the trim and technical specifications of some examples can be unique. The Uusikaupunki factory clearly had high aspirations for the car. Valmet Automotive even developed a prototype of an even longer, seven seat limousine as a concept car of an official state car. These aspirations were moderately met, although the Finnish government did not actually ever commission Saab to build such a car, the Saab 900CD was favoured as an official executive vehicle by several local municipalities, such as the city of Oulu, and several larger corporations in the wood and paper industry and electronics manufacture industry. It was also used by the Finnish government as the official state car of the Prime Minister during The Second Government of Mauno Koivisto between 1979 and 1982. He was particularly fond of its performance as it was equipped with a turbocharged engine, and he could thus out-run his bodyguards’ Saab 900&#x27;s which were naturally aspirated. In total, 579 cars were built between 1979 and 1986.

==== 900 Springtime in Sweden [SIS] ====


==== 900 Enduro ====
The Enduro was a special version of the 1980 900 Turbo assembled by Saab Scania Australia Pty. Ltd.; only eleven 900 Enduros were made along with a full body kit as a spare. Ken Matthews Prestige (a large Sydney-based Saab dealer at the time) were originally commissioned by Saab Australia to oversee the design and implementation of the overall engineering package, with the body modifications themselves designed and built by Purvis Cars of &quot;Eureka&quot; fame.

The package consisted of large fibreglass wheel arches to accommodate the extra track width front and rear, front air dam and rear fiberglass spoiler fully wider than normal 900 Turbo of that year. Extra gauges (oil pressure [0 to 500kPa – 0 to 75 psi], battery voltage [10 to 16 volts] and ammeter [-50 to +50 A]) were mounted where the radio usually was. The radio was moved to a new lower centre console that was not fitted to the 1980 model as standard. It was Eurovox MCC-9090R cassette player and radio with Voxson VX-89 graphic equaliser powering 6 speakers – 2x4&quot; full range front, 2x1&quot; dome tweeter overhead and 2x6&quot; tri-axial rear. Apart from this, the car had a standard turbo version interior with green seats and triangular center steering wheel.

The cars were fitted with either gold or black-centred (depending on body colour) Simmons &#x27;P-4&#x27; 3-piece composite alloy 7.5x15&quot; wheels with polished lip. The overall outside edge-to-edge distance is wider at the front and at the rear over a 900 Turbo of the day – mainly to decrease the roll centre height and improve turn-in response. Tyres were 225/50VR15 Pirelli Cinturato P7 units in the front and rear. Spare wheel was a full size steel rim 5x15&quot; with Michelin 175/70HR15 tyre.

Suspension was improved with 290 mm (free length) by 17 mm 368 lb 7.1 turn springs up front and 300 mm (free length) by 16 mm 484 lb 9 turn springs at the rear. Steering caster was set to +2.25 deg +/- .25 deg, camber to -1.75 deg +/- .25 deg and toe in was 2.5 mm +/- 0.5 mm.

To increase performance, the waste gate was set at 17 psi (1.2 bar), which delivered a claimed from its 8-valve B201 slant-4 engine. Upstream water injection came standard.

Paint was a 2-pack Dulux Acran enamel and came in at least four known colours: 137B &quot;Aquamarine Blue Metallic&quot; and a very light green (almost white) referred to as 152G &quot;Marble White&quot;. There was at least one Enduro painted in 121B &quot;Solar Red&quot; and a fourth in 148B &quot;Acacia Green Metallic&quot;. The hood, side window frames and rear deck were painted in Dulux GT Satin Black. Large &quot;ENDURO&quot; (in 99 TURBO style font) stripes were emblazoned on the hood, the rear deck and along both sides at sill level, although not all vehicles were treated to the &quot;Enduro&quot; hood graphics.

None of the cars are known to be ever exported from Australia, but it&#x27;s believed that no more than 6 examples survived to this day, with only 3 of them actually known. 2 of those were already extensively modified over the years, one awaiting full restoration. Some of the cars had the wheel centre replaced from Simmons P-4 to deeper dish V-4 version. There is also known a &quot;half-Enduro&quot; car, now owned by a real Enduro owner. The Saab dealer in Adelaide did the same Enduro fiberglass bodykit for their showcar (with a paint scheme of then non-existent 900 Lux) and advertised the conversion option for $5000. This was quickly put to an end as the dealer chose not to risk his dealership agreement with Saab.

==== 900 Lux ====

The Lux was a special model available 1983 and 1984. It came in a two-tone paint, usually slate blue metallic on top and silver below. It had a three-spoke steering wheel or more rarely four-spoke. It was one of the rarest models sold by the company, but the number produced is unknown.

==== 900 SE ====
The SE model was produced in May 1990 and was sold as a 5-door hatchback. A special colour called Iridium Blue with blue pinstripes down the sides. The car also featured multi-spoke alloys, full suite of electric equipment, grey leather seats, and wood effect as standard. Only 300 were originally made for the UK-market, with a choice of either a 2.0L N/A engine or 2.0L LPT version. 

==== 900 Carlsson ====
The Carlsson was a special edition 900 produced in honour of Erik Carlsson, of which only 600 examples were sold in the three years it was in production (1990 to 1992) and only available in the UK. It is thought by most that there were only 200 examples sold but in fact there were 200 examples sold for each of those three years. The standard colours which were offered were white, black or red but at the end of production, customers had the choice to order the Carlsson in a bespoke colour. All 900 Carlssons were 3-door hatchbacks, had a body coloured AirFlow body kit, were fitted with twin chrome exhausts, whaletail rear spoiler and were powered by the 1,985 cc turbocharged engine with an upgraded (Red) APC producing . The 900 Carlsson was also equipped with the &quot;Type 8&quot; primary gear set.

==== 1993 and 1994 Commemorative Editions ====
314 Commemorative Edition 900 Turbo 3-door Hatchback Coupés were made for the U.S. market in 1993. All the cars were painted solid black with a tan leather interior and had 5-speed manual transmissions. The horsepower was increased to by outfitting the cars with the &quot;red box&quot; APC controller, a 2.8-bar fuel pressure regulator (base turbo was 2.5 bar), and a distributor with enhanced vacuum advance. The cars rode on the SPG suspension. The interior was further embellished by a walnut dash facia and a leather gear knob and gaiter. The wheels were 15&quot; directionals painted medium-gray metallic units with a polished lip. Each Commemorative Edition was shipped with a small brass plaque indicating its number in the series. The plaques were serialized to indicate its number out of 325. 

500 Commemorative Edition 900T convertibles were delivered to the U.S. market in 1994. They were the last 500 classic 900 convertibles to be built. They had the same performance modifications as the 1993 Commemorative Edition vehicles with the exception of the lower SPG suspension. They all had the 5-speed manual transmission, and came with the same uniquely styled wheels, walnut dash facia, and leather gear knob and gaiter. The tan leather interior was further enhanced with black piping, which was exclusive to this model. The cars were all painted Nova Black Metallic (another feature exclusive to the 1994 Commemorative Edition) and had tan canvas tops. 500 identically equipped cars were shipped to Canada but have metric instruments. The 1994 CE vehicles did not have a plaque designating or celebrating the series. The VIN numbers do however run sequentially which, along with the Ruby, were the only Saab special edition series to do so.

==== 900 Ruby ====
Only available in the UK, the Ruby had the &#x27;Carlsson&#x27; engine but no body kit. All were in &#x27;Ruby&#x27; Red and can be distinguished from other 900s by the colour-coded bumpers and grey (rather than silver) alloy wheels. They also had the unique air-conditioned interior of buffalo leather with Zegna pure wool inserts in the seats and door panels. There were 150 examples, which were the last classic style 900s sold in the UK.

==== Swedish Special Edition ====
15 rarer LHD &quot;Ruby&quot; versions were also produced. 8 were made available to the Swedish market, known as the &quot;Swedish Special Edition&quot; and the rest were scattered in Europe. They were identical to the UK spec but had a more refined lower dash or knee guard and electric front seats.

==== Conversions ====

* Lynx Engineering produced two &quot;convertible&quot; models, just prior to the official 1986 launch.
* A demountable camper module, the Toppola, was created for the 3/5-door hatchback.
* Coachbuilder Nilsson built a wagon variant, the &#x27;Safari&#x27;.
* There were also a few limousine conversions. A typical modification is a 20 cm wheelbase stretch.

==== Dealer models ====

Some Saab dealers made special models. Saab Wimbledon made the &quot;Sprint&quot; and the &quot;Sport&quot;. The Sprint had a special body kit, lower, stiffer springs, and Pirelli Cinturato P7 on 7&quot;x16&quot; wheels. It also came with an intercooler, full colour-coding and 3-spoke leather steering wheel. The Sport had alloy wheels, full colour-coding and spoilers, uprated suspension, 3-spoke leather steering wheel, Clarion stereo and an electric aerial. Heuschmid GmbH offered options such as tuning, intercooler, suspensions tweaking and custom alloy wheels. EIA Motors of France made a series of 100 naturally aspirated 16 valve tuned to . Lynx Motors in the UK made a short run conversion of the two-door 900 shell to a convertible. The Winchester edition was a 4-door slate blue sedan and blue velour interior and wood trims.

Saab A.I.M of the Netherlands made two special models; both in an attempt to sell off 8-valve turbos late in the model&#x27;s life.
# Red Arrow: a red 900 Turbo 8V two-door (MY 1987 and 1988 – slant nose) with a grey AirFlow body kit and a whale tail spoiler. 150 were planned, 100 with whale tail and SuperInca wheels and 50 without whaletail and with 15-spoke Turbo85 wheels instead. Tan cloth interior with Carlsson steering wheel, manual side mirrors, window and no air-conditioning.
# Silver Arrow (MY 1985 and 1986, flat nose): Metallic silver 900 Turbo 8V sedan (known as Tudor or notchback) with special red/anthracite side striping, wooden four-spoke steering wheel and gear knob, aubergine velvet interior, with only manual windows and mirrors. The engine featured an intercooler and produced (no catalytic converter for Silver Arrow, so the Red Arrow made a bit less hp as it had it fitted already).

Both &#x27;Arrows&#x27; have a 1-150 and 1-200 numbered plaque on the dashboard and also a logo on the sides of the hood – above the fenders and on the back. It is believed that none of Arrows actually reached planned numbers for the limited production run – highest Red Arrow known is 138, Silver Arrow is 186. There are also few convertible versions styled as the Red Arrow (red car with grey AirFlow body kit), with no special version designated to it.
== Saab 900 NG (1994–1998) ==
The second or &#x27;new&#x27; generation Saab 900 (also referred to as the &quot;GM900&quot; or &quot;NG900&quot; among enthusiasts) was built on GM&#x27;s GM2900 platform as a replacement for the &quot;classic&quot; first-generation Saab 900. This all-new 900 was produced in 1994 through 1998 model years. In mid-1998 it received over 1100 individual improvements (although some were actually introduced on the 1998 900) and was renamed the Saab 9-3 (in most markets; in the US the new model was introduced in 1999).

=== Variants ===
Variants included 900i (4-cylinder, non-turbo), S (4-cylinder, non-turbo in the US; sometimes turbo in other markets) and SE (4-cylinder turbo or V6) models in three-door hatchback, five-door hatchback and convertible body styles. For 1997 and 1998 only, there was also a Saab 900 Talladega, after a record-breaking endurance test in 1996, on the Talladega Superspeedway.

The &quot;S&quot; and &quot;SE&quot; trim levels varied greatly in terms of equipment although in general, the SE trim level included Automatic Climate Control (ACC), leather interiors, wood-trimmed dashboards, and 16-inch wheels.

Depending on market, the NG900 was available with a choice of 2.0 L or 2.3 L Saab 16-valve DOHC engines (Saab B204 and B234) in naturally aspirated or turbocharged form (2.0 L only), as well as a 2.5 L version of GM&#x27;s European 54° V6 engine. Engine management for the turbos was by Saab Trionic 5 with Direct Ignition (SDI) and Automatic Performance Control (APC), and for naturally aspirated models by Bosch Motronic fuel injection. A distributor-operated ignition system was provided for naturally aspirated engines in some markets.

In contrast to the &#x27;classic&#x27; Saab 900 with its longitudinally mounted engine and front-hinged bonnet, the NG900 had a more-common transversely mounted engine with rear-hinged bonnet.

The convertible variant was introduced in 1995. Convertibles were produced at the Valmet plant in Finland. Convertibles were available in the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;SE&quot; trim levels.

=== Sensonic ===
The &#x27;Sensonic&#x27; clutch variant (available on Turbo models only) provided a manual gear lever as in a standard manual transmission car but omitted the clutch pedal in favor of electronics which could control the clutch faster than an average driver, essentially turning it into a clutchless manual transmission.

When the driver started to move the gearshift, a computer-controlled microprocessor would drive an electric motor, in turn, operating a hydraulic actuator connected to the clutch master cylinder, which used hydraulic fluid, and controlled the clutch automatically. With the car in gear but stationary, the clutch was released only when the throttle was applied. If neither brake nor gas pedal was depressed, a warning tone sounded and a message flashed on the on-board display, and if no action was taken after seven seconds, the engine was shut off.

Printed in error, a &quot;Hill Start&quot; function for Sensonic-equipped cars (as described in the owner&#x27;s manual under &quot;Rolling&quot;) was intended to assist in getting underway on hills to prevent rolling forwards or backwards. However, this feature was not implemented on any production unit.

The &#x27;Sensonic&#x27; clutch ceased production when the 900 model was replaced in 1998.

=== Saab Information Display ===
The NG900 introduced the Saab Information Display, or SID (available on S or SE models only), which gave the driver real-time information while driving, such as fuel efficiency and outside temperature. Base specification cars had a digital clock in place of the SID and a non-digital instrument panel with a mechanical odometer (as opposed to the digital odometer on higher-spec models). The SID also controls other vehicle components, including but not limited to audible warnings for turn signals and the vehicle&#x27;s horn.

=== NG engines ===
* 2.0 L &quot;B204I&quot; naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder, 
* 2.0 L &quot;B206I&quot; naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder with no balance shafts, 
* 2.0 L &quot;B204L&quot; 16-valve turbo intercooled, 
* 2.3 L &quot;B234I&quot; naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder, 
* 2.5 L &quot;B258I&quot; 24-valve 54º V6, 

=== Night Panel ===

One Saab innovation, inspired by the company&#x27;s roots in aeronautics, was the &#x27;Black Panel&#x27; feature available in classic models through the turn of the panel dimming knob, and subsequently available (on S or SE models only), through the touch of a button on the SID (Saab Information Display) digital panel (classics had analog display), which extinguished most instrument panel lights, to eliminate distraction from dash lights during night driving. While active, the SID activated feature permitted darkened instruments to re-illuminate themselves when they required driver attention — if for example, the engine speed increased alarmingly or if the fuel level should drop below . This feature was later renamed &#x27;Night Panel&#x27; in Saab 9-3 and Saab 9-5 models. In the later Night Panel version, the speedometer is only illuminated up to the 87 mph/140 km/h mark. The remainder of the scale will only be illuminated if the speed of the car exceeds 84 mph/135 km/h.
=== 900i ===

Under General Motors, Saab was repositioned as a luxury marque. This meant that the NG900 would be positioned, and priced, above the Opel Vectra, with which it shared its platform. It would also make the base 900i more expensive than the Vectra. This led to cost-reduction measures for the 900i. The 900i would lose its rear-window wiper, the exclusive Saab Information Display, and would utilize a different instrument layout with a mechanical odometer instead of a digital one; early models even lacked a tachometer. The NG900i would also lose its rear spoiler. Some 900i models were later equipped with a standard instrument cluster and the basic SID.

The 900i was only available in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as a three-door or a five-door with a choice of a 2.0 or 2.3 L engine. It did not sell very well in the UK and Australia, where the S and SE models were popular with Saab drivers. It was, however, popular as a cheaper alternative to the S and SE models.

<text>The Saab 9-2 (sometimes referred to as Saab 9-1) was a small family car that was proposed in February 2010 to have been added to Saab&#x27;s production line by 2014, under its then new ownership, Spyker Cars though some commentators considered the project a pipe dream.

The 9-2 was thought to developed in a joint venture with another automaker, probably European. Although little is known about the design, those who have seen it report it is the same teardrop shape as the 1949 to 1956 Saab 92, but also futuristic with the front similar to the new Saab 9-5. Saab Managing Director Jan-Åke Jonsson said the model would likely not be on the global GM Gamma platform.

Speculation in August 2009 suggested that the new small Saab would be based on the Saab 9-X Biohybrid concept car, which was shown at the 2008 Geneva Auto Show, and expected to compete with other premium small cars such as the Mini.

<text>Mister Ed is an American television sitcom produced by Filmways that aired in syndication from January 5 to July 2, 1961, and then on CBS from October 1, 1961, to February 6, 1966. The show&#x27;s title character is a talking horse which originally appeared in short stories by Walter R. Brooks.

&quot;Mister Ed&quot; is one of the few series to debut in syndication and be picked up by a major network for prime time. All 143 episodes were filmed in black and white.

==Beginnings==
The &quot;Mister Ed&quot; show concept was derived from a series of short stories by author Walter R. Brooks which began with &quot;The Talking Horse&quot; in the September 18, 1937, issue of &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. Brooks is best known for the &quot;Freddy the Pig&quot; series of children&#x27;s novels which feature talking animals that interact with humans. Arthur Lubin&#x27;s secretary Sonia Chernus introduced him to the Brooks stories and is credited with developing the concept for television.

The show&#x27;s concept resembles that of the &quot;Francis the Talking Mule&quot; movies in which an equine character talks to only one person, thus causing a variety of opportunities and frustrations. The first six &quot;Francis&quot; films (1950–55) were also directed by Lubin. He wanted to make a &quot;Francis&quot; television series but had been unable to secure the rights, so he optioned the Brooks&#x27; stories for television. Comedian George Burns financed the pilot for &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, which was shot at his McCadden Studio in Hollywood at a cost of $70,000. Scott McKay played Wilbur. Jack Benny was also involved behind the scenes.

Lubin was unable to sell the show to a network, so he decided to sell it into syndication first. He managed to get single-sponsor identification for the program on over 100 stations. The show was recast with Alan Young in the lead. Production began in November 1960, although Lubin did not direct early episodes because he was working in Europe on a film. The first 26 episodes were received well enough for the show to be picked up by CBS.

==Synopsis==
The show in effect had two leads operating as a comedy team. The title role of Mister Ed, a talking palomino, was played by gelding Bamboo Harvester and voiced by former Western film actor Allan Lane. The role of Ed&#x27;s owner, a genial but somewhat klutzy architect named Wilbur Post, was played by Alan Young. The Posts resided at 17230 Valley Spring Road in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Many of the program&#x27;s gags follow from Mister Ed&#x27;s tendency to talk only to Wilbur, his mysteriously well cultured essence, his rapscallion tendencies, and his precociously human-like behavior that far exceeds anything those around Wilbur expect of a horse. A running gag is other characters hearing Wilbur talking to Ed and asking to whom he is talking. Another running gag centers on Wilbur being accident-prone and inadvertently causing harm to himself and others. According to Lubin, Young was chosen for the lead role because he &quot;just seemed like the sort of guy a horse would talk to.&quot;

The other main character throughout the series is Wilbur&#x27;s generally tolerant young wife, Carol (Connie Hines). The Posts also have two sets of neighbors, to whom Ed delights in making Wilbur appear as eccentric as possible. They included the Addisons, Roger (Larry Keating) and his wife Kay (Edna Skinner), who both appeared from the pilot episode until Keating&#x27;s death in 1963; thereafter, Skinner continued appearing as Kay, without mention of Roger&#x27;s absence, until the neighbors were recast. During this period, Kay&#x27;s brother Paul Fenton (Jack Albertson), who had made occasional appearances before, appears. Following the Addisons, the Posts&#x27; new neighbors were Col. Gordon Kirkwood, USAF (Ret.), Wilbur&#x27;s former commanding officer (Leon Ames), and his wife Winnie (Florence MacMichael). They appeared on the series from 1963 to 1965. In the final season, the Kirkwoods were phased out, while Carol&#x27;s grumpy and uptight father, Mr. Higgins (Barry Kelley), who appeared occasionally throughout the entire series, apparently moved in with Wilbur and Carol during the final episodes. Wilbur and his father-in-law did not get along at all because Mr. Higgins loathed Wilbur, whose quirky eccentricity and klutzy, half-hearted attempts to be friendly always clashed with Mr. Higgins&#x27;s emotionless and uptight personality. Carol&#x27;s father never stopped trying to persuade her to divorce Wilbur, whom he often and openly referred to as a &quot;kook&quot; because of Wilbur&#x27;s clumsiness.

Mister Ed&#x27;s ability to talk was never explained and rarely contemplated on the show. In the first episode, when Wilbur expresses an inability to understand the situation, Mister Ed offers the show&#x27;s only remark on the subject: &quot;Don&#x27;t try. It&#x27;s bigger than both of us!&quot;

==Episodes==
==Production notes==
The original, unaired pilot for the series was titled &quot;Wilbur Pope and Mister Ed&quot; and featured an unrelated instrumental big-band theme (with footage of Studebaker Hawk automobiles being driven underneath the opening credits). This pilot, which used a script that was nearly identical to that which would be used on the series premiere, used a totally different cast. Scott McKay played the title part of Wilbur Pope (surname later changed to &quot;Post&quot; prior to the series making it to air) and Sandra White played the role of Wilbur&#x27;s wife.

The first horse that played Mister Ed for the first, unaired pilot episode was a chestnut gelding. The horse proved to be unruly and difficult to work with and was replaced with the horse named Bamboo Harvester (1949–1970), a crossbred gelding of American Saddlebred, Arabian and grade ancestry. A second pilot episode was filmed and Bamboo Harvester remained with the series until its cancellation.

===Making Ed &quot;talk&quot;===
&quot;Mister Ed&quot; producers left the talents that performed the title role uncredited. The show&#x27;s credits listed Mister Ed as being played only by &quot;Himself.&quot;

The voice actor for Ed&#x27;s spoken lines was Allan &quot;Rocky&quot; Lane, a former B-movie cowboy star. Sheldon Allman provided Ed&#x27;s singing voice in episodes; his solo line (&quot;I am Mister Ed&quot;) at the close of the show&#x27;s theme song was provided by its composer, Jay Livingston. Allan Lane was alluded to by the producers only as &quot;an actor who prefers to remain nameless.&quot; After the show became a hit, Lane campaigned the producers for screen credit but accepted a raise in salary instead.

The horse Bamboo Harvester portrayed Ed throughout the run. Ed&#x27;s stablemate, a quarter horse named Pumpkin, also served as Bamboo Harvester&#x27;s stunt double for the show. Pumpkin later appeared again in the television series &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

Bamboo Harvester&#x27;s trainer was Les Hilton. To create the impression that Ed was having a conversation, Hilton initially used a thread technique he had employed for Lubin&#x27;s earlier &quot;Mule&quot; films; in time, though, this became unnecessary. As actor Alan Young recounted: &quot;It was initially done by putting a piece of nylon thread in his mouth. But Ed actually learned to move his lips on cue when the trainer touched his hoof. In fact, he soon learned to do it when I stopped talking during a scene! Ed was very smart.&quot;

Reports circulated during and after the show&#x27;s run that the talking effect was achieved by crew members applying peanut butter to the horse&#x27;s gums. Alan Young said in later interviews that he invented the story. &quot;Al Simon and Arthur Lubin, the producers, suggested we keep the method [of making the horse appear to talk] a secret because they thought kids would be disappointed if they found out the technical details of how it was done, so I made up the peanut butter story, and everyone bought it.&quot;

Young added that Bamboo Harvester saw trainer Les Hilton as the disciplinarian father figure. When scolded by Hilton for missing a cue, the horse would move to Young for comfort, treating the actor as a mother figure. Hilton told Young this was a positive development.

===Theme song===
The theme song, titled &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, was written by the songwriting team of Jay Livingston and Ray Evans and sung by Livingston himself. The first seven episodes used only instrumental music to open the show; thereafter the version with lyrics was used. Livingston agreed to sing the song himself until a professional singer could be found; the producers liked the songwriter&#x27;s vocals and kept them on the broadcast. During most of the show&#x27;s run the ending theme song used only instrumental music. In some episodes, however, the theme song is sung during the closing credits. The theme was actually sung at the end in all but the first seven episodes. The severely shortened end credits imposed by the current distributor necessitated the use of a shortened instrumental version.

Before the theme song begins, the sound of Mr. Ed whinnying is heard before Mr. Ed&#x27;s human voice is heard saying &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Mr. Ed.&quot; The theme starts out with the famous lyrics &quot;A horse is a horse/Of course, of course.&quot;

The theme song received renewed publicity twenty years after the show went off the air when Jim Brown, a preacher from South Point, Ohio, claimed in May 1986 that it contained &quot;satanic messages&quot; if heard in reverse. Brown and his colleague Greg Hudson claimed that the phrases &quot;Someone sung this song for Satan&quot; and &quot;the source is Satan&quot; would be audible. At their behest teenagers burned over 300 records and cassettes of secular music with alleged satanic messages. The teens did not burn a copy of &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, but Brown asserted that &quot;Satan can be an influence whether they [the songwriters] know it or not. We don&#x27;t think they did it on purpose and we&#x27;re not getting down on &quot;Mister Ed&quot;.&quot;

===Sponsorship===
The series was sponsored from 1961 to 1963 by Studebaker-Packard Corporation and Studebaker Corporation. At first, sponsorship came from Studebaker&#x27;s dealer association, with corporate sponsorship coming from South Bend once the series had been picked up by CBS. Studebakers were featured prominently in the show during this period. The Posts are shown owning a 1962 Lark convertible, and the company used publicity shots featuring the Posts and Mister Ed with their product (various cast members also appeared in &quot;integrated commercials&quot; for Lark at the end of the program). When another Lark convertible served as the official pace car at the 1962 Indianapolis 500, Connie Hines attended the race as part of the promotion.

Studebaker&#x27;s sales dropped dramatically in 1961 and, despite their exposure via sponsoring this program, never recovered. Studebaker ended U.S. motor vehicle production on December 20, 1963. Later, Studebaker&#x27;s sponsorship and vehicle-supply agreement ended, and The Ford Motor Company provided the vehicles seen on-camera starting at the beginning of 1965. (Studebaker vehicle production continued in Canada, but ended completely in March 1966.)

==Home media==
MGM Home Entertainment released two &quot;Best-of&quot; collections of &quot;Mister Ed&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Volume 1 (released January 13, 2004) contains 21 episodes and Volume 2 (released March 8, 2005) contains 20 episodes. Due to poor sales, further volumes were not released.

MGM also released a single-disc release titled &quot;Mister Ed&#x27;s Barnyard Favorites&quot; on July 26, 2005, which contains the first eight episodes featured on Volume One.

Shout! Factory announced in June 2009 that they had acquired the rights to release &quot;Mister Ed&quot; on DVD, and subsequently released the six seasons on DVD in Region 1 in the U.S. Notably, Seasons 4 and 5 are not available outside of the continental U.S. The sixth and final season was released on May 12, 2015.

Syndicated versions of eight episodes were utilized for the Season One DVD release. All other DVD releases contain unedited, full-length versions.

One episode (the second-season episode &quot;Ed the Beneficiary&quot;) has lapsed into the public domain. Also in the public domain is a 19-minute production of the United States Department of the Treasury, done in the style of a Mister Ed episode with the show&#x27;s full cast (but without a laugh track), promoting Savings Bonds, and the original unaired pilot, which was published without a copyright notice.

On December 9, 2014, Shout! Factory released &quot;Mister Ed- Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 22-disc set contains all 143 episodes (including the eight episodes of season one uncut) of the series as well as bonus features.

♦- Shout! Factory Exclusives title, sold exclusively through Shout&#x27;s online store

==Remakes==
In 2004, a remake was planned for the Fox network as a reboot, directed by Michael Spiller and written by Drake Sather. The remake starred Sherman Hemsley as the voice of Mister Ed, David Alan Basche as Wilbur, and Sherilyn Fenn as Carol.

In 2012, Waterman Entertainment announced they were developing a new feature film based on &quot;Mister Ed&quot;.

==Legacy==
A race horse named after the character in the television show took part in the 1994 Grand National steeplechase at Aintree, England, but did not complete the course.

In 2007, it was reported that a housing developer intended to create a community near Tahlequah, Oklahoma, built around the supposed final resting place of Mister Ed (who died in 1970). It was intended to be themed to the style of the show and its period.

==Early life==
Sammi Cheng was previously named Twinnie Cheng. Contrary to popular belief, &quot;Twiny&quot; is not her birth name. The name came about when Sammi was still in school and her English Language teacher wanted everyone in class to have an English name. When Sammi turned to her sister for help, her sister came up with the name &quot;Twiny&quot;. The name was later changed to &quot;Sammi&quot; as &quot;Sammi&quot; sounds a little like &quot;Sau Man&quot;. Cheng received her education at SKH St. Peter&#x27;s Primary School and Tang Shiu Kin Victoria Government Secondary School.

She has three sisters and one brother. Two of her sisters are twins.

==Career==

===Music===
Sammi Cheng entered the entertainment industry at the age of 16 through the New Talent Singing Awards in 1988. Although she came in third in the competition, the sponsoring record company Capital Artists saw her potential and offered her a recording contract. Cheng at the time was still in school, and had to balance her studies with her rising singing career. Sammi released 3 full-length studio albums prior to leaving school: &quot;Sammi&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Never Too Late&quot;. One of her first major award was the 1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, where she was recognized as a best new prospect.

She capitalized on the attention received from her duet with artist Andy Hui, &quot;Do you really have me in your heart?&quot; (其實你心裡有沒有我), winning the 1993 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards with that song. Cheng then went through a transformation, dying her hair orange, changing her style. Her 4th studio album &quot;Sammi&#x27;s Happy Maze&quot; (鄭秀文的快樂迷宮) was also released, which include the hit single &quot;Chotto Matte&quot; (Chotto 等等), meaning &#x27;wait a moment&#x27; in Japanese. Her new image fitted well with the new single, which was a remake of a Japanese song by Maki Ohguro. The success helped Sammi and boosted her singing career. In 1994 she continued to capitalize on her wild, new image. Her first album of that year was &quot;Big Revenge&quot; (大報復). The album included the hit &quot;Ding Dong&quot; (叮噹), which became one of Sammi&#x27;s signature songs. But with her new fame also came a lot of backlash from the media. Critics argued that Sammi purposely westernized her Cantonese. Instead of saying &quot;Ding Dong&quot;, Sammi pronounced it as &quot;Deen Dong&quot;. Despite the criticism, the song was one of the most popular dance songs of that year. In 1994 the racy and controversial cut of &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; (十誡) was banned from the radio for a few days after its initial airplay of the track including tiny bits of what can be recognized as pornography soundtrack. In 1995 Cheng disappeared from the public eye for nearly half a year. Later that year, it was revealed that Warner Music Group had signed her. She let her hair color return to black and temporarily abandoned the wild image she used to have.

In 1995 she released her first album &quot;Missing you&quot; (捨不得你). In 1996, the company decided it was time for Sammi to expand her market and fan base beyond Hong Kong. They released her first Mandarin album, &quot;Worth It&quot; (值得). The album was number one on the Taiwan IFPI chart for six consecutive weeks. She won a number of awards, most notably she was voted back-to-back as the most popular female artist by TVB from 1996 to 1997. She went on to win the top female award again in 2001. She would finish that year with her first concert titled &quot;Sammi&#x27;s X-Dimension Concert&quot; (鄭秀文X空間演唱會). In 1998 she was also a featured star in a Heineken sponsored Music Horizons concert along with international singers such as Boyz II Men and Julian Lennon. By the time Cheng was 24 years old, she had already released four greatest hits albums.

In the 1990s, another female star, Faye Wong was one of her main rivals. When they were on stage together, they would be cold to one another. The rivalry was confirmed in the 1999 TVB music award night. Both Wong and Cheng were arranged to sit next to each other . Cheng avoided Wong by repeatedly going off stage to fix her make-up. In addition, her fans were angry and hissed at Faye Wong when she went on stage to receive an award. Wong herself has insisted that the rivalry wasn&#x27;t true, and that she was friendly toward Cheng.

In July 2004, she held 7 nights of &quot;Sammi Vs Sammi&quot; concerts in Hong Kong. She also broke the record as being the youngest female singer to hold more than 50 accumulated concert nights in the city.

From December 2014 to January 2015, she held 12 nights of &#x27;Touch Mi&#x27; concerts in Hong Kong Coliseum. She also invited heavyweight stars to be the guests of her concerts, including Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, Leon Lai, Ekin Cheng, Louis Koo, Nick Cheung and Eason Chan. Her &#x27;Touch Mi&#x27; concert extends to World Tour in 2015 and 2016 with 4 shows at Genting (Malaysia), 3 shows at Macau (China), 3 shows at Singapore, 2 shows at Guangzhou (China), 1 show at Foshan (China), 1 show at Melbourne (Australia), 2 shows at Sydney (Australia), 1 show at Shenzhen (China), 1 show at London (United Kingdom). Her &#x27;Touch Mi&#x27; World Tour concluded in Hong Kong with another 8 shows in September 2016, hence bringing her total number of shows for this world tour to 38. Some of her new guest stars in Touch Mi 2 Hong Kong shows are Dayo Wong, Dicky Cheung, Francis Ng and Alex To.

In 2017, she held a series of mini-concert tours entitled &quot;Naked. Sammi&quot; in Taiwan and China. Also, she held a private mini-concert in Macau, entitled &quot;Sammi Cheng VIP Music Private Enjoy Show&quot;. She held a single-show Sidetrack Birthday Gig concert at Macau on 19 August 2018 in conjunction of her 46th birthday as a treat to her fans. At the same year she collaborate for the first time with Taiwanese rock band 831, releasing her remake song &quot;眉飛色舞Plus&quot; (Eyebrow Dance Plus).

In conjunction with her 30th anniversary in the entertainment industry, her 10th concert world tour is organized, which began with 13 shows at Hong Kong&#x27;s Coliseum in July 2019. This brought her total shows in Hong Kong&#x27;s Coliseum exceeding 100-mark, at 102.

<text>Safety is the state of being protected from harm or other danger. Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

==Meanings==

The word &#x27;safety&#x27; entered the English language in the 14th century. It is derived from Latin , meaning uninjured, in good health, safe.

There are two slightly different meanings of &quot;safety&quot;. For example, &quot;home safety&quot; may indicate a building&#x27;s ability to protect against external harm events (such as weather, home invasion, etc.), or may indicate that its internal installations (such as appliances, stairs, etc.) are safe (not dangerous or harmful) for its inhabitants.

Discussions of safety often include mention of related terms. Security is such a term. With time the definitions between these two have often become interchanged, equated, and frequently appear juxtaposed in the same sentence. Readers are left to conclude whether they comprise a redundancy. This confuses the uniqueness that should be reserved for each by itself. When seen as unique, as we intend here, each term will assume its rightful place in influencing and being influenced by the other.

&quot;Safety&quot; is the condition of a &quot;steady state&quot; of an organization or place doing what it is supposed to do. &quot;What it is supposed to do&quot; is defined in terms of public codes and standards, associated architectural and engineering designs, corporate vision and mission statements, and operational plans and personnel policies. For any organization, place, or function, large or small, safety is a normative concept. It complies with situation-specific definitions of what is expected and acceptable.

Using this definition, protection from a home&#x27;s external threats and protection from its internal structural and equipment failures (see Meanings, above) are not two types of safety but rather two aspects of a home&#x27;s steady state.

In the world of everyday affairs, not all goes as planned. Some entity&#x27;s steady state is challenged. This is where security science, which is of more recent date, enters. Drawing from the definition of safety, then:

&quot;Security&quot; is the process or means, physical or human, of delaying, preventing, and otherwise protecting against external or internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and other individuals or actions that threaten, hinder or destroy an organization’s &quot;steady state,&quot; and deprive it of its intended purpose for being.

Using this generic definition of safety it is possible to specify the elements of a security program.

==Limitations==
Safety can be limited in relation to some guarantee or a standard of insurance to the quality and unharmful function of an object or organization. It is used in order to ensure that the object or organization will do only what it is meant to do.

It is important to realize that safety is relative. Eliminating all risk, if even possible, would be extremely difficult and very expensive. A safe situation is one where risks of injury or property damage are low and manageable.

When something is called safe, this usually means that it is safe within certain reasonable limits and parameters. For example, a medication may be safe, for most people, under most circumstances, if taken in a certain amount.

A choice motivated by safety may have other, unsafe consequences. For example, frail elderly people are sometimes moved out of their homes and into hospitals or skilled nursing homes with the claim that this will improve the person&#x27;s safety. The safety provided is that daily medications will be supervised, the person will not need to engage in some potentially risky activities such as climbing stairs or cooking, and if the person falls down, someone there will be able to help the person get back up. However, the end result might be decidedly unsafe, including the dangers of transfer trauma, hospital delirium, elder abuse, hospital-acquired infections, depression, anxiety, and even a desire to die.

==Types==
There is a distinction between products that meet standards, that are safe, and that merely feel safe. The highway safety community uses these terms:

===Normative===

Normative safety is achieved when a product or design meets applicable standards and practices for design and construction or manufacture, regardless of the product&#x27;s actual safety history.

===Substantive===
Substantive or objective safety occurs when the real-world safety history is favorable, whether or not standards are met.

===Perceived===
Perceived or subjective safety refers to the users&#x27; level of comfort and perception of risk, without consideration of standards or safety history. For example, traffic signals are perceived as safe, yet under some circumstances, they can increase traffic crashes at an intersection. Traffic roundabouts have a generally favorable safety record yet often make drivers nervous.

Low perceived safety can have costs. For example, after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, many people chose to drive rather than fly, despite the fact that, even counting terrorist attacks, flying is safer than driving. Perceived risk discourages people from walking and bicycling for transportation, enjoyment or exercise, even though the health benefits outweigh the risk of injury.

Perceived safety can drive regulation which increases costs and inconvenience without improving actual safety.

===Security===
Also called social safety or public safety, security addresses the risk of harm due to intentional criminal acts such as assault, burglary or vandalism.

Because of the moral issues involved, security is of higher importance to many people than substantive safety. For example, a death due to murder is considered worse than a death in a car crash, even though in many countries, traffic deaths are more common than homicides.

===Operational safety===

Operational safety refers to the state in which the risk to life, health, property, or the environment from a system or subsystem in an operational setting is maintained at an acceptable level. Achieving this requires identifying hazards, assessing risks, implementing mitigation measures, and accepting any remaining risk.

== Risks and responses ==
Safety is generally interpreted as implying a real and significant impact on risk of death, injury or damage to property. In response to perceived risks many interventions may be proposed with engineering responses and regulation being two of the most common.

Probably the most common individual response to perceived safety issues is insurance, which compensates for or provides restitution in the case of damage or loss.

== System safety and reliability engineering ==
System safety and reliability engineering is an engineering discipline. Continuous changes in technology, environmental regulation and public safety concerns make the analysis of complex safety-critical systems more and more demanding.

A common fallacy, for example among electrical engineers regarding structure power systems, is that safety issues can be readily deduced. In fact, safety issues have been discovered one by one, over more than a century in the case mentioned, in the work of many thousands of practitioners, and cannot be deduced by a single individual over a few decades. A knowledge of the literature, the standards and custom in a field is a critical part of safety engineering. A combination of theory and track record of practices is involved, and track record indicates some of the areas of theory that are relevant. (In the US, persons with a state license in Professional Engineering in Electrical Engineering are expected to be competent in this regard, the foregoing notwithstanding, but most electrical engineers have no need of the license for their work.)

Safety is often seen as one of a group of related disciplines: quality, reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. (Availability is sometimes not mentioned, on the principle that it is a simple function of reliability and maintainability.) These issues tend to determine the value of any work, and deficits in any of these areas are considered to result in a cost, beyond the cost of addressing the area in the first place; good management is then expected to minimize total cost.

== Measures ==
&quot;Safety measures&quot; are activities and precautions taken to improve safety, i.e. reduce risk related to human health. Common safety measures include:
* Chemical analysis
* Destructive testing of samples
* Drug testing of employees, etc.
* Examination of activities by specialists to minimize physical stress or increase productivity
* Geological surveys to determine whether land or water sources are polluted, how firm the ground is at a potential building site, etc.
* Government regulation so suppliers know what standards their product is expected to meet.
* Industry regulation so suppliers know what level of quality is expected. Industry regulation is often imposed to avoid potential government regulation.
* Instruction manuals explaining how to use a product or perform an activity
* Instructional videos demonstrating proper use of products
* Root cause analysis to identify causes of a system failure and correct deficiencies.
* Internet safety or online safety, is protection of the user&#x27;s safety from cyber threats or computer crime in general.
* Periodic evaluations of employees, departments, etc.
* Physical examinations to determine whether a person has a physical condition that would create a problem.
* Process safety management is an analytical tool focused on preventing and managing releases of hazardous materials in industrial plants.
* Safety margins/safety factors, for instance, a product rated to never be required to handle more than 100 kg might be designed to fail under at least 200 kg, a safety factor of two. Higher numbers are used in more sensitive applications such as medical or transit safety.
* Self-imposed regulation of various types.
* Implementation of standard protocols and procedures so that activities are conducted in a known way.
* Statements of ethics by industry organizations or an individual company so its employees know what is expected of them.
* Stress testing subjects a person or product to stresses in excess of those the person or product is designed to handle, to determining the &quot;breaking point&quot;.
* Training of employees, vendors, product users
* Visual examination for dangerous situations such as emergency exits blocked because they are being used as storage areas.
* Visual examination for flaws such as cracks, peeling, loose connections.
* X-ray analysis to see inside a sealed object such as a weld, a cement wall or an airplane outer skin.

==Research==
Today there are multiple scientific journals focusing on safety research. Among the most popular ones are Safety Science and Journal of Safety Research. 

The goal of this research is to identify, understand, and mitigate risks to human health and well-being in various environments. This involves systematically studying hazards, analyzing potential and actual accidents, and developing effective strategies to prevent injuries and fatalities. Safety research aims to create safer products, systems, and practices by incorporating scientific, engineering, and behavioral insights. Ultimately, it seeks to enhance public safety, reduce economic losses, and improve overall quality of life by ensuring that both individuals and communities are better protected from harm.

== Standards organizations ==
A number of standards organizations exist that promulgate safety standards. These may be voluntary organizations or government agencies. These agencies first define the safety standards, which they publish in the form of codes. They are also Accreditation Bodies and entitle independent third parties such as testing and certification agencies to inspect and ensure compliance to the standards they defined. For instance, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) formulated a certain number of safety standards in its Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) and accredited TÜV Rheinland to provide certification services to guarantee product compliance to the defined safety regulations.

=== United States===

====American National Standards Institute ====
A major American standards organization is the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Usually, members of a particular industry will voluntarily form a committee to study safety issues and propose standards. Those standards are then recommended to ANSI, which reviews and adopts them. Many government regulations require that products sold or used must comply with a particular ANSI standard.

==== Government agencies ====
Many government agencies set safety standards for matters under their jurisdiction, such as:
* the Food and Drug Administration
* the Consumer Product Safety Commission
* the United States Environmental Protection Agency

==== Testing laboratories ====
Product safety testing, for the United States, is largely controlled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In addition, workplace related products come under the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which certifies independent testing companies as Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTL), see.

=== European Union ===

====Institutions====
* the European Commission (EC)
* the European Committee for Standardization (CEN)
* the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
* the European Safety Federation (ESF)

====Testing laboratories====
The European Commission provides the legal framework, but the different Member States may authorize test laboratories to carry out safety testing.

=== Other countries ===

====Standards institutions====
* British Standards Institution
* Canadian Standards Association
* Deutsches Institut für Normung
* International Organization for Standardization
* Standards Australia

====Testing laboratories====
Many countries have national organizations that have accreditation to test and/or submit test reports for safety certification. These are typically referred to as a Notified or Competent Body.

<text>Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg ( or simply &quot;THA&quot;) is a public university located in Augsburg, Germany. It was founded in 1971, but its institutional roots as an academy of arts date back to 1670. With more than 7,000 students it is one of the largest institutions of its kind in Bavaria. 185 professors as well as 408 lecturers in 7 faculties are employed in the university. Currently, 23 undergraduate and 22 graduate degree programmes are offered.

It hosts the website, which features a catalogue of electronic texts.

== Faculties ==

* Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* Faculty of Architecture and Civil Engineering
* Faculty of Electrical Engineering
* Faculty of Design
* Faculty of Computer Science
* Faculty of Mechanical and Process Engineering
* School of Business

== History ==

The first institution associated with the university, the &#x27;Reichsstädtische Kunstakademie Augsburg&#x27;, was founded in 1710. In 1833, the Royal Polytechnic School was founded, the forerunner of today&#x27;s engineering faculties. Other institutions such as the Royal Industrial School, the Augsburg Rudolf Diesel School of Building and Engineering (Academy for Applied Technology) and the Augsburg School of Art and Design can be mentioned as roots of the university. In 1971, the university was officially founded with a Faculty of Design and a Faculty of Engineering. The other faculties and institutes followed as the university expanded to its current size.

In July 2022, the Bavarian Minister President Markus Söder awarded the then University of Applied Sciences Augsburg the title of &quot;Technical University&quot; in recognition of its scientific achievements in the technical field. At the start of the 2023 summer semester, the university was officially renamed Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.

== Campuses ==

The university has two main sites, centrally located in Augsburg and 500 metres apart from each other.

The &quot;Brunnenlech Campus&quot; (buildings A to H), located between Brunnenlechgässchen and Baumgartnerstrasse, houses the Faculty of Architecture and Civil Engineering, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Faculty of Mechanical and Process Engineering. The administration, library and computer centre are also located on the Brunnenlech campus.

The &quot;Red Gate Campus&quot; (buildings J to M and W), located along Friedberger Straße, houses the Faculty of Computer Science, the Faculty of Design, the School of Business, as well as the President&#x27;s and Public Relations offices.

<doc id="252719" wikidata="Q183383" url="?curid=252719" title="Colugo">
<text>Colugos (), flying lemurs, or cobegos (), are arboreal gliding euarchontogliran mammals that are native to Southeast Asia. Their closest evolutionary relatives are primates. There are just two living species of colugos: the Sunda flying lemur (&quot;Galeopterus variegatus&quot;) and the Philippine flying lemur (&quot;Cynocephalus volans&quot;). These two species make up the entire family Cynocephalidae () and order Dermoptera, from Ancient Greek δέρμα (&quot;dérma&quot;) &quot;skin&quot; and πτερόν (&quot;pterón&quot;) &quot;wing&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Colugos are nocturnal, tree-dwelling mammals. 

=== Appearance and anatomy ===
They reach lengths of and weigh . They have long, slender front and rear limbs, a medium-length tail, and a relatively light build. The head is small, with large, front-focused eyes for excellent binocular vision, and small rounded ears.

The incisor teeth of colugos are highly distinctive; they are comb-like in shape with up to 20 tines on each tooth. The incisors are analogous in appearance and function to the incisor suite in strepsirrhines, which is used for grooming. The second upper incisors have two roots, another unique feature among mammals. The dental formula of colugos is: 
=== Movement ===
Colugos are proficient gliders, and thought better adapted for flight than any other gliding mammal.
They can travel as far as from one tree to another without losing much altitude, with a Malayan colugo (&quot;Galeopterus variegatus&quot;) individual having been observed traveling about in one glide.

Their ability to glide is possible because of a large membrane of skin that extends between their paired limbs. This gliding membrane, or patagium, runs from the shoulder blades to the fore paws, from the tip of the rear-most fingers to the tip of the toes, and from the hind legs to the tip of the tail. The spaces between the colugo&#x27;s fingers and toes are webbed. As a result, colugos were once considered to be close relatives of bats. Today, on account of genetic data, they are considered to be more closely related to primates.
Colugos are unskilled climbers; they lack opposable thumbs. They progress up trees in a series of slow hops, gripping onto the bark with their small, sharp claws. They spend most of the day resting. At night, colugos spend most of their time up in the trees foraging, with gliding being used to either find another foraging tree or to find possible mates and protect territory.

=== Behavior and diet ===
Colugos are shy, nocturnal, solitary animals found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. Consequently, very little is known about their behavior. They are herbivorous and eat leaves, shoots, flowers, sap, and fruit. They have well-developed stomachs and long intestines capable of extracting nutrients from leaves and other fibrous material.

As part of colugos&#x27; evolution into a nocturnal species, they developed night vision. Colugos spend their days resting in tree holes and are active at night time; traveling around 1.7 km at night. Colugos may also be a territorial species.

=== Life cycle ===
Although they are placentals, colugos raise their young in a manner similar to marsupials. Newborn colugos are underdeveloped and weigh only . They spend the first six months of life clinging to their mother&#x27;s belly. The mother colugo curls her tail and folds her patagium into a warm, secure, quasipouch to protect and transport her young. The young do not reach maturity until they are two to three years old. In captivity, they live up to 15 years, but their lifespan in the wild is unknown.

== Status ==
Both species are threatened by habitat destruction, and the Philippine flying lemur was once classified by the IUCN as vulnerable. In 1996, the IUCN declared the species vulnerable owing to destruction of lowland forests and hunting. It was downlisted to least-concern status in 2008 but still faces the same threats. In addition to the ongoing clearing of its rainforest habitat, it is hunted for its meat and fur. It is also a favorite prey item for the critically endangered Philippine eagle; some studies suggest colugos account for 90% of the eagle&#x27;s diet.

== Taxonomy ==
Their family name Cynocephalidae comes from the Ancient Greek words (&quot;kyōn&quot;) &quot;dog&quot; and (&quot;kephalē&quot;) &quot;head&quot; because their heads are broad with short snouts like dogs.

== Classification and evolution ==
It is estimated the ancestors of the colugos split from other mammals about 80 million years ago, leading to the present day forms that consist of 7 to 14 extant species. The Mixodectidae and Plagiomenidae appear to be fossil Dermoptera. Although other Paleogene mammals have been interpreted as related to dermopterans, the evidence for this association is uncertain and many of the fossils are no longer interpreted as being gliding mammals. At present, the fossil record of definitive dermopterans is limited to two species of the Eocene and Oligocene cynocephalid genus &quot;Dermotherium&quot;.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that colugos emerged as a basal Primatomorpha clade – which, in turn, is a basal Euarchontoglires clade. Scandentia are widely considered to be the closest relatives of Primatomorpha, within Euarchonta. Some studies, however, place Scandentia as sister of Glires (lagomorphs and rodents), in an unnamed sister clade of the Primatomorpha.

<text>A wheelbarrow is a small hand-propelled load-bearing vehicle, usually with just one wheel, designed to be pushed and guided by a single person using two handles at the rear. The term &quot;wheelbarrow&quot; is made of two words: &quot;wheel&quot; and &quot;barrow.&quot; &quot;Barrow&quot; is a derivation of the Old English &quot;barew&quot; which was a device used for carrying loads.

The wheelbarrow is designed to distribute the weight of its load between the wheel and the operator, so enabling the convenient carriage of heavier and bulkier loads than would be possible were the weight carried entirely by the operator. As such it is a second-class lever. Traditional Chinese wheelbarrows, however, had a central wheel supporting the whole load. Use of wheelbarrows is common in the construction industry and in gardening. Typical capacity is approximately of material.

A two-wheel type is more stable on level ground, while the almost universal one-wheel type has better maneuverability in small spaces, on planks, in water, or when tilted ground would throw the load off balance. The use of one wheel also permits greater control of the deposition of the load upon emptying.

==History==
===China===


The earliest wheelbarrows with archaeological evidence in the form of a one-wheel cart come from second-century Han dynasty Emperor Hui&#x27;s tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 AD. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 AD. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel &quot;lu che&quot; barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 AD). Earlier accounts dating to the 1st century BC and 1st century AD that mention a &quot;deer cart&quot; (luche) might also have been referencing a wheelbarrow.

The 5th-century &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a &quot;lu che&quot; back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BC. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 AD) against Xin dynasty&#x27;s Wang Mang (45 BC–23 AD), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his &quot;lu che&quot; barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill. The first recorded description of a wheelbarrow appears in Liu Xiang&#x27;s work &quot;Lives of Famous Immortals&quot;. Liu describes the invention of the wheelbarrow by the legendary Chinese mythological figure Ko Yu, who builds a &quot;Wooden ox&quot;.

Nevertheless, the Chinese historical text of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; (Records of the Three Kingdoms), compiled by the ancient historian Chen Shou (233–297 AD), credits the invention of the wheelbarrow to Prime Minister Zhuge Liang (181–234 AD) of Shu Han from 197–234. It was written that in 231 AD, Zhuge Liang developed the vehicle of the wooden ox and used it as a transport for military supplies in a campaign against Cao Wei.

====Centrally mounted wheel====

Further annotations of the text by Pei Songzhi (430 AD) described the design in detail as a large single central wheel and axle around which a wooden frame was constructed in representation of an ox. Writing later in the 11th century, the Song dynasty (960–1279) scholar Gao Cheng wrote that the small wheelbarrow of his day, with shafts pointing forward (so that it was pulled), was the direct descendant of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s wooden ox. Furthermore, he pointed out that the third century &#x27;gliding horse&#x27; wheelbarrow featured the simple difference of the shaft pointing backwards (so that it was pushed instead).

Wheelbarrows in China came in two types. The more common type after the third century has a large, centrally mounted wheel. Prior types were universally front-wheeled wheelbarrows. The central-wheeled wheelbarrow could generally transport six human passengers at once, and instead of a laborious amount of energy exacted upon the animal or human driver pulling the wheelbarrow, the weight of the burden was distributed equally between the wheel and the puller. European visitors to China from the 17th century onwards had an appreciation for this, and it was given a considerable amount of attention by a member of the Dutch East India Company, Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, in his writings of 1797 (who accurately described its design and ability to hold large amounts of heavy baggage). These wheelbarrows continued in use into the twentieth century, and a good example of this is the &#x27;Piepkar&#x27;, which is a wheelbarrow on rails, and was found in Sumatra on Billiton Island. However, the lower carrying surface made the European wheelbarrow clearly more useful for short-haul work. As of the 1960s, traditional wheelbarrows in China were still in wide use.

====Chinese sailing carriage====

Although there are records of Chinese sailing carriages from the 6th century these land sailing vehicles were not wheelbarrows, and the date of which the sail assisted wheelbarrow was invented is uncertain. Engravings are found in van Braam Houckgeest&#x27;s 1797 book.

European interest in the Chinese sailing carriage is also seen in the writings of Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest in 1797, who wrote:

Near the southern border of Shandong one finds a kind of wheelbarrow much larger than that which I have been describing, and drawn by a horse or a mule. But judge by my surprise when today I saw a whole fleet of wheelbarrows of the same size. I say, with deliberation, a fleet, for each of them had a sail, mounted on a small mast exactly fixed in a socket arranged at the forward end of the barrow. The sail, made of matting, or more often of cloth, is high, and broad, with stays, sheets, and halyards, just as on a Chinese ship. The sheets join the shafts of the wheelbarrow and can thus be manipulated by the man in charge.

=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===
M. J. T. Lewis surmised the wheelbarrow may have existed in ancient Greece in the form of a one-wheel cart. Two building material inventories for 408/407 and 407/406 B.C. from the temple of Eleusis list, among other machines and tools, &quot;1 body for a one-wheeler ()&quot;, although there is no evidence to prove this hypothesis.( in Greek):

Since () and () mean nothing but &quot;two-wheeler&quot; and &quot;four-wheeler,&quot; and since the () body is sandwiched in the Eleusis inventory between a four-wheeler body and its four wheels, to take it as anything but a one-wheeler strains credulity far beyond breaking point. It can only be a wheelbarrow, necessarily guided and balanced by a man...what does now emerge as certainty is that the wheelbarrow did not, as is universally claimed, make its European debut in the Middle Ages. It was there some sixteen centuries before.

M. J. T. Lewis admits that the current consensus among technology historians, including Bertrand Gille, Andrea Matthies, and Joseph Needham, is that the wheelbarrow was invented in China around 100 AD and spread to the rest of world. However, Lewis proposes that the wheelbarrow could have also existed in ancient Greece. Based on the Eleusis list, Lewis states that it is possible that wheelbarrows were used on Greek construction sites, but admits that evidence for the wheelbarrow in ancient farming and mining is absent. He surmised that wheelbarrows were not uncommon on Greek construction sites for carrying moderately light loads. He speculates the possibility of wheelbarrows in the Roman Empire and the later Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire, although Lewis concludes that the evidence is scarce, and that &quot;most of this scenario, perforce, is pure speculation.&quot; The 4th century Historia Augusta reports emperor Elagabalus to have used a wheelbarrow ( from , one-wheeled vehicle) to transport women in his frivolous games at court. While the present evidence does not indicate any use of wheelbarrows into medieval times, the question of continuity in the Byzantine Empire is still open, due to a lack of research yet. Currently, there is no evidence for the wheelbarrow in ancient Greece and Rome.

===Medieval Europe===
The first wheelbarrows in medieval Europe appeared sometime between 1170 and 1250. In contrast to the ones which typically have a wheel in the center of the barrow and were preferred in China, the types mostly used in Europe featured a wheel at or near the front, the arrangement of most wheelbarrows today.

Research on the early history of the wheelbarrow is made difficult by the marked absence of a common terminology. The historian of technology M.J.T. Lewis has identified in English and French sources four mentions of wheelbarrows between 1172 and 1222, three of them designated with a different term. According to the medieval art historian Andrea Matthies, the first archival reference to a wheelbarrow in medieval Europe is dated 1222, specifying the purchase of several wheelbarrows for the English king&#x27;s works at Dover. The first depiction appears in an English manuscript, Matthew Paris&#x27;s &quot;Vitae duorum Offarum&quot;, completed in 1250.

By the 13th century, the wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations the wheelbarrow remained a relative rarity until the 15th century. It also seemed to be limited to England, France, and the Low Countries.

The oldest wheelbarrows preserved from Central Europe were found in 2014 and 2017 during archaeological excavations in Ingolstadt, Germany. The felling dates of the trees that make up the wheelbarrow boards could be dendrochronologically dated to 1537 for one wheelbarrow and the 1530s for the other.

===Modern wheelbarrows===

Modern day wheelbarrows are generally made from plastic or metal and generally come with either a pneumatic tire, semi-pneumatic tire, or solid tire. Modern wheelbarrows come in four standard shapes, the home gardener shallow-tray variety, the builder&#x27;s barrow, the square tray utility barrow and the brick barrow.

Plastic wheelbarrows can be beneficial as they are light in weight reducing physical demand on the user. But plastic wheelbarrows are also suited to lighter loads.

Steel wheel barrows can handle heavier loads with carrying capacities of up to wet, or dry. Steel wheelbarrows more effectively transport heavy, jagged material without damaging the wheelbarrow and are often better suited to construction applications.

===Modern variations===

In the 1970s, British inventor James Dyson introduced the Ballbarrow, an injection-molded plastic wheelbarrow with a spherical ball on the front end instead of a wheel. Compared to a conventional design, the larger surface area of the ball made the wheelbarrow easier to use in soft soil, and more laterally stable with heavy loads on uneven ground.

The Honda HPE60, an electric power-assisted wheelbarrow, was produced in 1998. Power-assisted wheelbarrows are now widely available from a number of different manufacturers. Powered wheelbarrows are used in a range of applications; the technology has improved to enable them to take much heavier loads, beyond weights that a human could transport alone without assistance. Motorized wheelbarrows are generally either diesel powered or electric battery powered. Often used in small-scale construction applications where access for larger plant machinery might be restricted.

<text>Leon Marcus Uris (August 3, 1924 – June 21, 2003) was an American author of historical fiction who wrote many bestselling books, including &quot;Exodus&quot; (published in 1958) and &quot;Trinity&quot; (published in 1976).

==Life and career==
Uris was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Jewish American parents Wolf William and Anna (née Blumberg) Uris. His father, born in Volkovysk in the Russian Empire (now Vawkavysk, Belarus), was a paperhanger, then a storekeeper. His mother was first-generation Russian American. William spent a year in Palestine after World War I before entering the United States. He derived his last name from Yerushalmi, meaning &quot;man of Jerusalem&quot;. (His brother Aron, Leon&#x27;s uncle, took the name Yerushalmi.) &quot;He was basically a failure&quot;, Uris later said of his father. &quot;I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of being a Jew in Czarist Russia. I think failure formed his character, made him bitter.&quot;


At age six, Uris reportedly wrote an operetta inspired by the death of his dog. He attended schools in Norfolk, Virginia, and Baltimore, but never graduated from high school, and failed English three times. When he was 17 and in his senior year of high school, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He served in the South Pacific with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines Regiment, where he was stationed in New Zealand, and fought as a radioman in combat on Guadalcanal and Tarawa from 1942 through 1944. He was sent to the US after suffering from dengue fever, malaria and a recurrence of asthma that made him miss the devastation of his battalion at the Battle of Saipan, which was featured in &quot;Battle Cry&quot;. While recuperating from malaria in San Francisco, he met Betty Beck, a Marine sergeant; they married in 1945.

Released from service he worked for a newspaper, and wrote in his spare time. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine bought an article in 1950, and he began to devote himself to writing more seriously. Drawing on his experiences in Guadalcanal and Tarawa, he produced the best-selling &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, a novel depicting the toughness and courage of U.S. Marines in the Pacific. He then went to Warner Brothers in Hollywood helping to write the eponymous movie which was extremely popular with the public, but not the critics. He went on to write &quot;The Angry Hills&quot;, a novel set in war-time Greece.

His best-known work may be &quot;Exodus&quot;, which was published in 1958. Most sources indicate that Uris, motivated by an intense interest in Israel, financed his research for the novel by selling the film rights in advance to MGM and by writing newspaper articles about the Sinai campaign, which is said to have involved two years of research, and thousands of interviews. It was a worldwide best-seller, translated into a dozen languages, and was made into a feature film in 1960, starring Paul Newman, directed by Otto Preminger, as well as into a short-lived Broadway musical, &quot;Ari&quot;, in 1971, for which Uris wrote the book and lyrics.

&quot;Exodus&quot; illustrated the history of Palestine from the late 19th century through the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. &quot;Exodus&quot; was also extraordinarily influential among Russian Refuseniks. Two typewritten Russian translations were circulated as samizdat – illegal, hand-copied works that were passed secretly from hand to hand – and the story was retold orally in the prison camps, with the oral version eventually being written in a notebook which was passed from one generation of prisoners to the next.

Uris&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;Topaz&quot; was adapted for the screen and directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1969. His subsequent works included &quot;Mila 18&quot;, about the Warsaw ghetto uprising; &quot;&quot;, a chronicle which ends with the lifting of the Berlin Blockade in 1949; &quot;Trinity&quot;, about Irish nationalism, and the sequel, &quot;Redemption&quot;, covering the early 20th century and World War I.

&quot;QB VII&quot;, about the role of a Polish doctor in a German concentration camp, is a dramatic four-part courtroom novel written by Uris that was published in 1970, highlighting the events leading to a libel trial in the United Kingdom. It is loosely based on a court case for defamation (&quot;Dering v Uris&quot;) that arose from Uris&#x27;s earlier best-selling novel &quot;Exodus&quot;. It was Uris&#x27;s second consecutive #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. &quot;The Haj&quot; was set in the history of the Middle East. He also wrote the screenplays for &quot;Battle Cry&quot; and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Uris was married three times. His first wife was Betty Beck, whom he married in 1945. They had three children before divorcing in 1968. He then married Marjorie Edwards in 1968, who committed suicide by gunshot the following year.

His third and last wife was photographer Jill Peabody, daughter of Frances Gleason and Alfred Peabody of Boston. They had two children. They married in 1970, when Jill was 22 years old and he was 45. He and wife Jill worked together on his book &quot;Ireland: A Terrible Beauty&quot;, for which she provided illustrations and on &quot;Jerusalem: A Song of Songs&quot;. They divorced in 1988, and soon after Uris settled in New York City.

==Death==
Leon Uris died of kidney failure at his Long Island home on Shelter Island in 2003, aged 78. His papers can be found at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas in Austin, where the University of Texas Press published a literary biography about him. The collection includes all of Uris&#x27;s novels, with the exception of &quot;The Haj&quot; and &quot;Mitla Pass&quot;, as well as manuscripts for the screenplay &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;. He was survived by his five children and two grandchildren.

<doc id="252733" wikidata="Q4007" url="?curid=252733" title="Rosenheim">
<text>Rosenheim () is a city in Bavaria, Germany. It is an independent city located in the centre of the district of Rosenheim (Upper Bavaria), and is also the seat of its administration. It is located on the west bank of the Inn at the confluence of the rivers Inn and Mangfall, in the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. It is the third largest city in Upper Bavaria with over 64,000 inhabitants. Rosenheim is the economic centre and the busiest place in the region.

==Geography==
The population of the actual city is approximately 60,000 inhabitants with up to 125,000 in the surrounding area. Rosenheim is situated in the Upper-Bavarian Alpine Foothills, above sea level and covers an area of . The capital of Bavaria, Munich, is North-West of Rosenheim. Rosenheim station is at the junction of the Munich–Rosenheim, the Rosenheim–Salzburg and the Munich–Innsbruck lines.

The landscape around Rosenheim was formed during the last ice age from the advancement of the Inn Valley Glacier and later the Rosenheim lake. The lake existed about 10,000 years ago, covering the whole Inn valley as far as Wasserburg am Inn, about north of Rosenheim.

Even today in many places around the city the former shoreline can be recognised where the former flat lake bed changes suddenly into relatively steep embankment.

==History==

Rosenheim&#x27;s development can be traced from its location on intersecting major trade routes. Even in early times, the town&#x27;s intersecting traffic stimulated its development as a market town. It subsequently evolved from a market to a salt trade and then railway town to today&#x27;s wood and college city.

===Pons Aeni===
Crucial to the establishment of Rosenheim were the Inn and the corresponding Inn valley. The Romans arrived in the year 15 BC under the leadership of Drusus and Tiberius. They founded the province Noricum to the East of the Inn and Rhaetia to the west of the Inn. The colonizers built a road through the Brenner to Castra Regina, and an east–west road from Iuvavum to Augusta Vindelicum. The intersection of these two enormously important trade routes were protected by a military station whose name was &quot;Pons Aeni&quot;. Less frequently used terms were &quot;Ponte Aoni&quot;, &quot;Ad enum&quot; or &quot;stations Enensis&quot;. The Romano Celtic settlement existed for some 500 years with that name. Pons was between Aeni Isinisca (Aying) and (today part of Seeon-Seebruck), as shown on the Roman road map Tabula Peutingeriana from the 4th century. The name &quot;Pons Aeni&quot; can still be recognised in local place names, &quot;Pfunzen&quot; in the name of the district &quot;Langenpfunzen&quot; and &quot;Leonhardspfunzen&quot;.

===Etymology===
The origin of the city&#x27;s name is not entirely clear. First mentioned in 1234, Rosenheim castle is on the eastern bank of the Inn, on today&#x27;s castle hill, overlooking a new bridge over the Inn. Possibly,the name comes from the Rosenheim Rose emblem of the Wasserburger Earl Hall, who built the castle. Another theory is that the name Ross derives from the &quot;Rössern&quot; steeds that were used in medieval times to pull the river transport vessels, and for which there were large stables in Rosenheim. The street names &quot;Am Esbaum&quot; (the tree on which the horses were grazing) or &quot;Am Roßacker&quot; add some weight to this suggestion.

A third theory suggests that there could be a kindred word &quot;Roas&quot;, &quot;Roze&quot; or &quot;Ried&quot;, that used to mean swamp and peat bogs, which are still to be found around Rosenheim – evident also by the name of the neighboring town of Rosenheim Kolbermoor. An example of the old names, the nearby village of Riedering. Maybe the name is also derived from Rosenheim personal names &quot;Roso&quot;/&quot;Hrodo&quot;. The most beautiful word for word theory is that formerly &#x27;Rose&#x27; used to mean a beautiful girl. It was well known among the Inn boatmen that there were many beauties to admire in this town. The sailors of the town liked to control what was called &quot;home of the Rose&quot; – in other words Rosenheim.

===Development of Rosenheim===
At about the time of the first mention of Rosenheim castle in 1234, a settlement of boatmen developed on the western shore. The area around the Inn Bridge was not developed for a long time due to marshy soil at the proximity of the mouth of the river Mangfall, so the settlement was located several hundred meters away. The centre of Rosenheim is therefore not directly on the riverside.

===Market Rosenheim===
The town quickly grew in importance as a hub for all types of goods that were transported on the Inn (livestock, grain, silk, arms, salt) and in 1328 received Market town status. The Rosenheim ship masters made Rosenheim very wealthy during this era through the transport of goods, due to the location between Hall in Tirol the Inn and onwards to the Danube down to Vienna and Budapest. Until about 1600 the settlement had grown into one of the largest and most important markets in Bavaria, even though town privileges were only attained in 1864 from the Bavarian King Ludwig II.

Rosenheim experienced economic decline during the 17th century in the wake of the decline of Inn Shipping Company and the consequences of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. There was also a plague epidemic in 1634 and a market fire in 1641.

In the 19th century Rosenheim developed as an economic centre in the Southeast of Bavaria due to brine. In 1810 an early type of wooden pipeline brought brine from the Reichenhall and Traunstein salt mines to Rosenheim. Boiling the brine to make salt made Rosenheim the centre of Bavarian salt production until 1958.

Expansion of the railways brought early connection to the railway network. In 1858 Rosenheim station was inaugurated, however it would soon be too small and prove a hindrance for further urban development. In 1876 the station moved to its present site. The old railway line was the straight through road (now the city hall and Prince Regent Street, main Rosenheimer transport axis, from the northwest to the southeast of the city), the roundhouse of the original station is now an exhibition centre. The old station is directly opposite the 1878 City Hall and is used in the ZDF evening series &quot;Die Rosenheim-Cops&quot; as the police headquarters backdrop.

The economic boom of the late 19th and early 20th century made the Gründerzeit – and Art Nouveau (and its regional characteristics, the Swiss chalet style) the most important architectural style, which now determines the townscape. The evangelical Church of the Redeemer was built in the neo-Gothic clinker brick style, which is rare for Rosenheim, for the growing Evangelical Lutheran congregation in the official district around today&#x27;s town hall.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Rosenheim had nine breweries which are preserved in the names of some restaurants (Duschl-, Hof-, Mail-, Pernloher-, Stern-, Weißbräu). The only survivors being &quot; and &quot; who supply the &quot;Märzen&quot; for the &quot;&quot; as well as the Bierbichler Weißbräu, among others.

===Rosenheim in the Nazi era===
The number of Jews living in Rosenheim was high compared to other Bavarian cities. At the start of the 20th century the Jewish community consisted of about 50 people. A request was made to the city council for establishment of a separate Jewish religious association, with reference to the Bavarian-Jewish legislation, but it was refused, so the Rosenheim Jews remained attached to the state capital, where their dead also had to be buried. Even the funeral of the First World War fallen son of a Jewish merchant based in Rosenheim at the city cemetery was refused and was &quot;the biggest disappointment and the bitterest pain&quot; for the father.
With the creation of the first local Nazi group outside of Munich in 1920, the Rosenheim Jews saw increasing hostility. Centre of hate campaigns was the Rosenheim School. A scandal occurred in June 1920, after a reader accused the writer of a letter titled &quot;Rosenheimer Jews&quot; in the local press, who wanted to repeal the provisions of the Versailles Treaty and held military exercises at the Rosenheim School. Seven members of the high school and a member of the &quot;Chiemgau&quot; then raided a villa inhabited by Jews in the &quot;Herbststrasse&quot;. The college of the city of Rosenheim, on 29 July 1920 came to the conclusion that 
Protests of the Bavarian Jewish Central Association were unsuccessful, only an unmistakable message of the Bavarian Interior Ministry September 1920 was able to maintain peace.
On 1 April 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, guards were set up in front of Jewish shops, warning against buying in these stores but to desist assault and criminal damage. A large proportion of the population ignored these calls. The shops were therefore still frequented, much to the annoyance of Nazi activists who acted with the backing of then-Mayor Gmelch. Despite the support of the population, six of the eleven Jewish business owners gave up their businesses by 1937.

The assassination of German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by the Polish Jewish teenager Herschel Grynszpan on 7 November 1938 in Paris was taken as the pretext for Kristallnacht, a final opportunity to strike against the Jews. The SA came with 8 to 10 men on 10 November at 3–4 o&#x27;clock in the morning to the last two Jewish shops, and destroyed their inventory and merchandise.

The fate of many Rosenheim Jews is documented. Those who could emigrate did so, mostly to the United States. However, many failed entry and exit applications, and many died in concentration camps.

===Bombing during World War II===
From the beginning of bombing raids on German cities in the spring of 1942, Rosenheim was not spared. In November 1943 there were shelters for only 650 people for a population of approximately 22,000. However, by February 1944 shelters had been built for about 6400 people and in conjunction with other shelters a total of 10,525 people could be protected.

During 14 bomb attacks, 201 people were killed and 179 injured. The focus of the air attacks was the railway station and the railway tracks, as Rosenheim was an important transportation hub between Munich, Salzburg and Innsbruck. The neighbouring communities of Ziegelberg, Stephanskirchen, Westerndorf St. Peter and Oberpfaffenhofen were also hit. The first air attack was on 20 October 1944 at lunch time from 12:47 to 13:17, with over a hundred aircraft dropping ~1,000 bombs, leaving 27 dead and 59 wounded. The heaviest air raid took place on 18 April 1945. From 14:40 to 14:55, around 200 aircraft dropped around 1300 bombs in the area around the station, resulting in 53 dead and 36 injured. This attack also made 800 people homeless. The station building was almost completely destroyed and a total length of 20 kilometres of railway tracks were destroyed. The last air attacks were made on 19 and 21 April 1945. During the war the majority of at least 173 unexploded bombs were recovered. In 1964, the &quot;Oberbayerisches Volksblatt&quot; reported that the approximate location of 38 undiscovered unexploded ordnance was known.

===Historical timeline===


===Population growth===


===Coat of arms===

Rosenheim&#x27;s coat of arms shows a white rose on a red background. The white rose on a red background can be traced back to the former coat of arms of Wasserburg am Inn, as Wasserburg ruled Rosenheim until 1247. The oldest known seal of Rosenheim was built in 1374 and already shows the rose, which has not changed since. The only exception is a picture by Philipp Apian, which was painted around the year 1568 and shows a border around the rose.

The city of Rosenheim also has a logo and the same rose from the coat of arms can be found on it.

==Landmarks and culture==
===Theatre===
The &quot;Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim (KU&#x27;KO)&quot; (Culture and Congress Centre) was built on the site of the brine works, demolished in 1967. Inaugurated on 2 October 1982 as the city hall, now the Rosenheim Culture and Congress Centre has evolved over the years into a national event centre. Today in the 3000-square-meter multipurpose building approximately 400 events are held annually.

===Museums===
Since 1885, the has housed the Municipal Museum with a large collection (about 5000 exhibits) of the cultural history of the city and district of Rosenheim, from the prehistory and early history and Roman times to the recent city history in the 20th century. It is one of the most important regional history collections in South East Upper Bavaria.

The Inn Museum houses the hydraulic engineering and marine technology collection of the Rosenheim Water Management Office and is located in the historic river master&#x27;s &quot;Bruckbaustadel&quot; at the Inn Bridge. With many original objects, the museum displays the Inn Shipping Company, the source of Rosenheim&#x27;s prosperity in the Middle Ages, in the past centuries. In addition, the museum provides facts about the river landscape and river engineering, geology, settlement history, marine engineering, bridge design and the development of waterways.

The &quot;Wood technology Museum&quot; was established in 1990 in the listed Ellmaierhaus. It is housed on the first floor, which is accessed via the so-called Jacob&#x27;s ladder. Over 400 square meters of exhibition space this unique museum displays wood as a raw material, its importance and processing past and present, which is closely related to the &quot;timber town of Rosenheim&quot; and its training centres for wood occupations. The exhibition shows not only the end products, but also their production and the necessary tools. Regular special exhibitions complete the offer of the &quot;Wood technology Museum&quot;.

The Municipal Gallery of 1935–1937 was built by German Bestelmeyer. Every year, six art exhibitions are held here. In addition to contemporary art, also exhibitions of works from the 19th and 20th century are held. A thematic focus is the art from the region and the Munich School.

The &quot;&quot; is an internationally renowned exhibition centre with annually changing exhibitions in the former railway locomotive round house.

The brine pump house is one of the few monuments in the city which recall time from 1810 to 1958 of Rosenheim&#x27;s brine industry. As part of the National Exposition &quot;salt makes history&quot;, the city renovated the historic listed building and set up an exhibition room about Rosenheim&#x27;s brine history. Admission is only possible with city guides or by agreement with the Metropolitan Museum.

The &quot;&quot; museum houses various exhibits, on the one hand the history of the Klepper folding boat, coats and tents. On the other hand, it is also dedicated to the development of the company Klepper, who was once the biggest employer in Rosenheim.

===Architecture===

The Mittertor (the sole survivor of five market gates) was the eastern gate of the market town before 1350, which was then protected with a double ditch. Since the 15th century, it separated the interior from the exterior of the market town and served as a customs office. Until the 19th century it also contained several municipal facilities such as the city clerk&#x27;s office. After the great fire in 1641 the Rosenheim onion dome was built and later extended into a long building. At its core is the Mittertor, the oldest building in the city. On the façade facing the square is the emblem of Louis Rosenheim, with the white rose against a red background. The Bavarian crest can also be seen here.
The street &quot;Münchener Strasse&quot; follows the &quot;Gillitzerblock&quot;, that is also called &quot;small pedestrian zone.&quot; Immediately apparent are the magnificently restored Gründerzeit fronts. The name &quot;Gillitzerblock&quot; come from its builder Thomas Gillitzer. At the end of the 19th century he obtained a relatively large area of land for its day, and built 15 houses, including the Hotel &quot;Deutscher Kaiser&quot;. Since the 1960s, the once solely Gründerzeit ensemble has been altered with new construction and renovations. Only the façades in &quot;Münchener Strasse&quot; have been preserved and restored to the original.

The &quot;Quest-&quot; was built from 1855 to 1916 in several phases as industrial complexes. &quot;Kunstmühle&quot; was at these times the name for technically advanced mills which were generally not powered by water or wind – German &quot;Kunst&quot; meaning art, therefore implying artificially powered in English (Steam, Diesel, etc.). The mill was renovated in the 1990s and now serves as a restaurant and office space. The &quot;Quest-Kunstmühle&quot; Power station is located on the Mangfallkanal. The former mill houses the exhibition halls of the Rosenheim arts club. The approximately upper floor holds exhibitions of contemporary artists, exchange exhibitions with other art associations and activities accompanying the exhibition.

The Rosenheim ballroom was built in the former Rosenheim Hofbräus buildings. The hall with ballroom and vaulted cellar was built in 1878. It was renovated in 1994 and since 2001 has been used as an event space, with its many possible uses of the centre of the eastern city of Rosenheim.

The city&#x27;s landmark is the gothic spire () of the parish church St. Nikolaus () with its baroque onion dome ().

===Parks===
The &quot;Kunstwiese&quot; shows three-dimensional contemporary art works by artists from Rosenheim all year round.

The &quot;Riedergarten&quot; was created in 1729 as a private herb garden by Rosenheim pharmacist Johann Rieder. It was sold to the town in 1925 by physician Herman Rieder for use as a summer garden. In 2002 the garden was redesigned by the opening up of a previously culverted stream, adding a modern character.

Since 1987 the &quot;Salingarten&quot;, in front of the Culture and Congress Centre Ku&#x27;Ko, has been used as a sculpture garden. Large sculptures by important sculptors from Rosenheim and environment can be seen here.

==Transport==
There are regular regional train connections to Munich and Salzburg. Rosenheim is also connected to the EuroCity network.

<doc id="252735" wikidata="Q470772" url="?curid=252735" title="Rahul Dravid">
<text>Rahul Sharad Dravid (; born 11 January 1973) is a former cricket player, ex-captain and ex-coach of the Indian national cricket team. Known for his outstanding batting technique, Dravid scored 24,177 runs in international cricket and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is colloquially known as &quot;Mr. Dependable&quot; and often referred to as &quot;The Wall&quot;. He won the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy as a member of the Indian team and guided the Indian team to victory in the 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup as the head coach.

Prior to his appointment to the senior men&#x27;s national team, Dravid was the Head of Cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), and the head coach of the India Under-19 and India A teams. Under his tutelage, the Under-19 team finished as runners-up at the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup and won the 2018 U-19 Cricket World Cup. Under his coaching, Indian cricket team finished as runners-up at the 2023 Cricket World Cup and 2023 ICC World Test Championship final and were semifinalist at the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

Born in a Marathi family and raised in Bangalore, he started playing cricket at the age of 12 and later represented Karnataka at the under-15, under-17 and under-19 levels. Dravid was named one of the best five cricketers of the year by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; in 2000 and received the Player of the Year and the Test Player of the Year awards at the inaugural ICC awards ceremony in 2004. In December 2011, he became the first non-Australian cricketer to deliver the Bradman Oration in Canberra.

As of January 2022, Dravid is the fourth-highest run scorer in Test cricket, after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis. In 2004, upon scoring a century against Bangladesh in Chittagong, he became the first player to score a century in all the ten Test-playing countries (now 12). As of October 2012, he holds the record for the most catches taken by a player (non-wicket-keeper) in Test cricket, at 210. Dravid holds a unique record of never getting out for a golden duck in the 286 Test innings that he has played during his career. He has faced 31,258 balls, which is the largest number of balls faced by any player in test cricket. He has also spent 44,152 minutes at the crease, which is the highest time spent on the crease by any player in test cricket. Dravid and Tendulkar hold the highest scoring partnership in Test cricket history, having scored 6,920 runs combined while batting together for India.

In August 2011, after receiving a surprise recall during the ODI series against England, Dravid declared his retirement from ODIs as well as Twenty20 International (T20I), and in March 2012, he announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket. He appeared at the 2012 Indian Premier League as captain of the Rajasthan Royals.

Rahul Dravid, along with Glenn McGrath, were honoured during the seventh annual Bradman Awards function in Sydney on 1 November 2012. Dravid has also been awarded the Padma Shri (2004) and the Padma Bhushan (2013), India&#x27;s fourth and third highest civilian awards respectively.

In 2014, Rahul Dravid joined the GoSports Foundation as a member of their board of advisors. In collaboration with GoSports Foundation, he is mentoring India&#x27;s future Olympians and Paralympians as part of the Rahul Dravid Athlete Mentorship Program. Indian badmintonist Prannoy Kumar, para-swimmer Sharath Gayakwad and golfer S. Chikkarangappa were part of the initial group of athletes that were mentored by Rahul Dravid. In July 2018, Dravid became the fifth Indian cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Dravid was born to a Marathi-Speaking Brahmin family in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. His family later moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, where he was raised. His mother tongue is Marathi. Dravid&#x27;s father, Sharad Dravid, worked for a company that produces jams and preserves, giving rise to the later nickname &quot;Jammy&quot;. His mother, Pushpa, was a professor of architecture at the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore. Dravid has a younger brother named Vijay.

Rahul Dravid attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Boys High School and earned a degree in commerce from St Joseph&#x27;s College of Commerce. He was selected to India&#x27;s national cricket team while working towards an MBA at the St Joseph&#x27;s College of Business Administration. He is fluent in Marathi, Kannada, English and Hindi.

==Formative years and domestic career==
Dravid started playing cricket at the age of 12 and represented Karnataka at the under-15, the under-17, and the under-19 levels. Former cricketer Keki Tarapore first noticed Dravid&#x27;s talent while coaching at a summer camp in the Chinnaswamy Stadium. Dravid scored a century for his school team. He also played as wicket-keeper.

Dravid made his Ranji Trophy debut in February 1991, while still attending college. Playing alongside future India teammates Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath against Maharashtra in Pune, he scored 82 runs in the match, which ended in a draw. He followed it up with a century against Bengal and three successive centuries after. Dravid&#x27;s first full season took place in 1991–92, when he scored two centuries and finished up with 380 runs at an average of 63.30, resulting in his selection to the South Zone cricket team in the Duleep Trophy. Dravid caught the national team selectors&#x27; attention with his positive performances for India A in the home series against England A in 1994–95.

==International career==
===Debut===
Dravid received his first call to the Indian national cricket team in October 1994 for the last two matches of the Wills World Series. However, he could not break into the playing eleven and had to return to the domestic circuit. Despite a stellar show in domestic cricket, Dravid was not selected for the Indian team for the 1996 World Cup, prompting an Indian daily newspaper to run an article with the headline – &quot;Rahul Dravid gets a raw deal&quot;.

He eventually made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup, replacing Vinod Kambli. He wasn&#x27;t particularly successful with the bat, scoring only three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan, but took two catches in the match. He followed it up with another failure in the next game, scoring only four runs before being run out against Pakistan.

In contrast to his ODI debut, his Test debut was rather successful. He was selected for the Indian squad touring England on the backdrop of a consistent performance in domestic cricket for five years. Fine performances in the tour games including fifties against Gloucestershire and Leicestershire failed to earn him a place in the team for the First Test. He finally made his Test debut at Lord&#x27;s on 20 June 1996 against England in the Second Test of the series at the expense of injured senior batsman Sanjay Manjrekar. Manjrekar, who was suffering from an ankle injury, was to undergo a fitness test on the morning of the Second Test. Dravid had already been informed that he would play if Manjrekar failed the test. Manjrekar subsequently failed the test. Ten minutes before the toss, Sandeep Patil, the Indian coach, informed Dravid that he was indeed going to make his debut that day. Patil recalled years later:

Coming in to bat at no. 7, he forged important partnerships, first with another debutante Sourav Ganguly and then with Indian lower order, securing a vital first innings lead for his team. Dravid scored 95 runs missing out on a debut hundred as he walked off after getting caught behind to a Chris Lewis delivery. During this match, he also took his first catch in Test cricket to dismiss Nasser Hussain off the bowling of Srinath. In the next tour game against British Universities, Dravid scored a hundred. He scored another fifty in the first innings of the Third Test. Dravid concluded a successful debut series with an average of 62.33 from two Test matches.
===1996–98===
Dravid&#x27;s early years in international cricket mirrored his international debut. He had contrasting fortunes in the long and the shorter format of the game. While he was successful in Test cricket, he struggled with ODIs.

After his Test debut in England, Dravid played in the one-off Test against Australia in Delhi – his first Test in India. Batting at no. 6, he scored 40 runs in the first innings. Dravid batted at no. 3 position for the first time in the First Test of the three-match home series against South Africa in Ahmedabad in November 1996. He failed to perform well in the series, scoring only 175 runs at an average of 29.16.

Two weeks later, India toured South Africa for a three–match Test series. Chasing a target of 395 runs in the First Test, the Indian team got bowled out for 66 runs on the Durban pitch that provided excessive bounce and seam movement. Dravid, batting at no. 6, was the only Indian batsman who reached double figures in the innings, scoring 27 not out. He was promoted to the no. 3 slot again in the second innings of the Second Test. He almost won the Third Test for India with his maiden test hundred in the first innings, scoring 148 runs and another 81 runs in the second innings at Wanderers before the thunderstorms, dim light and Cullinan&#x27;s hundred helped South Africa draw the match. Dravid&#x27;s performance in this Test earned him his first Man of the Match award in Test cricket. He top scored for India in the series with 277 runs at an average of 55.40.&lt;ref name=&quot;Most runs: India in South Africa Test series, 1996/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dravid continued in the same vein in the West Indies, where he once again top scored for India in the five–match Test series, aggregating 360 runs at an average of 72.00, including four fifties. 92 runs scored in the first innings of the fifth match in Georgetown earned him a joint Man of the Match award along with Shivnarine Chanderpaul. With this series, Dravid concluded the 1996-97 Test season, topping the international runs chart with 852 runs from 12 matches at an average of 50.11, with six fifties and a hundred.

Dravid continued his successful run, scoring seven fifties in the next eight Tests that included fifties in six consecutive innings (three each against Sri Lanka and Australia), becoming only the second Indian to do so after Gundappa Vishwanath. By the end of 1997-98 Test season, he had scored 15 fifties in 22 Tests including four scores of nineties but just one hundred.

During the 1998-99 Test season, Dravid scored 752 runs in seven Tests at an average of 62.66, that included four hundreds and one fifty. In the process, he topped the runs chart for India for the season. He scored the first of the four hundreds during the Zimbabwe tour. Dravid top scored in both innings against Zimbabwe, scoring 118 and 44 runs respectively; however, India lost the one-off Test.

The Zimbabwe tour was followed by a tour to New Zealand. The First Test having been abandoned without a ball being bowled, the series started for Dravid with the first duck of his Test career in the first innings of the Second Test and ended with hundreds in both innings of the Third Test in Hamilton. He scored 190 and 103 not out in the first and the second innings respectively, becoming only the third Indian batsman, after Vijay Hazare and Sunil Gavaskar, to score a century in both innings of a Test match. Dravid topped the runs table for the series with 321 runs at an average of 107.00, although India lost the series 0–1.

Later that month, India played a two Test home series against Pakistan. Dravid didn&#x27;t contribute much with the bat. India lost the First Test but won the Second Test in Delhi with Kumble&#x27;s historic 10-wicket haul. Dravid played his part in the 10-wicket haul by taking a catch to dismiss Mushtaq Ahmed, who was Kumble&#x27;s eighth victim in the innings. The India-Pakistan Test series was followed by the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship. India went on to lose the riot-affected First Test of the championship against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens. India went to Sri Lanka to play the Second Test of the championship. Dravid scored his fourth hundred of the season at Colombo in the first innings of the match. He also effected a successful run out of Russel Arnold during Sri Lankan innings fielding at short leg. On the fourth morning, Dravid was injured while fielding at the same position when the ball from Jayawardene&#x27;s pull shot struck his face through the helmet grill. He didn&#x27;t come out to bat in the second innings due to the injury. The match ended in a draw as India failed to qualify for the Finals of the championship.

In a stark contrast to his Test career, Dravid struggled to make a mark in the ODIs. Between his ODI debut in April 1996 and the end of 1998, Dravid regularly found himself in and out of the ODI team.

Dravid&#x27;s first success in his ODI career took place in the 1996 &#x27;Friendship&#x27; Cup against Pakistan in the tough conditions of Toronto. He emerged as the highest scorer of the series with 220 runs in five matches at an average of 44.00 and a strike rate of 68.53. He won his first ODI Man of the Match award for the 46 runs scored in the low scoring third game of the series. He top scored for India in the Standard Bank International One-Day Series 1996/97 in South Africa with 280 runs from eight games at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 60.73, the highlight being a Man of the Match award-winning performance (84 runs, one catch) in the Final of the series, although his team lost the match. He was the second highest run scorer for India in the four-match bilateral ODI series in the West Indies in the 1996–97 season with 121 runs at an average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 57.61. Dravid scored his first ODI hundred in the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup against Pakistan in Chennai that came in a losing cause. Dravid top scored for India in the quadrangular event with 189 runs from three games at an average of 94.50 and a strike rate of 75.60. However, India failed to qualify for the Final of the series.

Dravid&#x27;s achievements in the ODIs were dwarfed by his failures in the shorter format of the game. 14 runs from two games in the 1996 Pepsi Sharjah Cup; 20 runs from two innings in the Singer World Series; 65 runs from four innings in the 1997 &#x27;Friendship&#x27; Cup; 88 runs from four games in the 1998 Coca-Cola Triangular Series including a 22-ball five runs and a 21-ball one run innings, both against Bangladesh; 32 runs from four games in the 1998 &#x27;Friendship&#x27; Cup; a slew of such poor performances often forced him to the sidelines of the India ODI squad. By the end of 1998, Dravid had scored 1,709 runs in 65 ODIs at an average of only 31.64 with a low strike rate of 63.48.

By now, Dravid had been branded as a Test specialist. While he continued a successful run in Test cricket, he struggled in the ODIs. He drew criticism for not being able to adjust his style of play to the needs of ODI cricket and his lack of attacking capability. Dravid subsequently increased his range of strokes and adapted his batting style to suit the requirements of ODI cricket. He learned to pace his innings cleverly without going for the slogs.

Dravid&#x27;s ODI success began during the 1998-99 New Zealand tour. He scored a run-a-ball hundred in the first match of the bilateral ODI series that earned him his third Man of the Match award in ODIs. His team lost the match. However, his effort of 51 runs from 71 balls in the Fourth ODI resulted in India&#x27;s victory and earned him his second Man of the Match award of the series. He became the top scorer of the series with 309 runs from five games at an average of 77.25 and a strike rate of 84.65. Dravid scored a hundred against Sri Lanka in the 1998/99 Pepsi Cup at Nagpur, scoring 116 of 118 deliveries. In the next match against Pakistan, he bowled four overs and took the wicket of Saeed Anwar. This was his first wicket in international cricket.

Dravid scored two fifties in the 1998–99 Coca-Cola Cup in Sharjah, one each against England and Pakistan. Standing-in as the substitute wicket-keeper in the third match of the series for Nayan Mongia, who was injured during keeping, Dravid effected two dismissals. He first stumped Graeme Hick off Sunil Joshi&#x27;s bowling, who became Dravid&#x27;s first victim as a wicket-keeper, and then caught Neil Fairbrother off Ajay Jadeja&#x27;s bowling. He top scored for India in the tournament, though his last ODI innings was a golden duck against Pakistan.

===World Cup debut===
Dravid hit consecutive fifties in England against Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire in the warm-up games.

He made his World Cup debut against South Africa at Hove, scoring a half century. He scored only 13 runs in the next game against Zimbabwe. India lost both the games. Having lost the first two games, India needed to win the remaining three games of the first round to have any chance of advancing into the Super Six stage. Dravid set up a partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, during which they scored 237 runs against Kenya at Bristol – a World Cup record – and in the process hit his maiden World Cup hundred, leading India to a 94-run victory. India&#x27;s designated keeper Nayan Mongia was injured and left the field at the end of the 9th over during Kenyan innings, forcing Dravid to keep the wickets for the rest of the innings. In the absence of Mongia, Dravid played his first ODI as a designated keeper against Sri Lanka at Taunton. Dravid once again set up a record breaking partnership that resulted in 318 runs, the first ever three hundred run partnership in ODI history, with Sourav Ganguly leading India to a 157-run win. Dravid scored 145 runs from 129 balls with 17 fours and a six, becoming the second batsman in World Cup history to hit back-to-back hundreds. Dravid scored a fifty in the last group match as India defeated England to advance to the Super Six stage. Dravid scored 2, 61, and 29 in the three Super Six matches against Australia, Pakistan &amp; New Zealand respectively. India failed to qualify for the semi-finals, having lost to Australia and New Zealand. They achieved a consolation victory against Pakistan in a tense game that took place during the Kargil War in Kashmir. Dravid emerged as the top scorer of the tournament with 461 runs from 8 games at an average of 65.85 and a strike rate of 85.52.

Dravid&#x27;s post-World Cup campaign started poorly with only 40 runs scored in 4 games during the Aiwa Cup in August 1999. He soon top-scored for India in two consecutive limited-overs series – the Singapore Challenge, the highlight being a hundred in the Final (despite their loss), and the DMC Cup, the highlight being a match winning effort (77 runs, 4 catches) in the series decider for which he received a man-of-the-match award. Dravid topped the international runs chart for the 1999 cricket season across all formats, scoring 782 runs during 19 matches. By now, Dravid had started to keep wickets on an infrequent basis, with India fielding him as designated wicket-keeper in five out of 10 ODIs played in the three events.

Dravid began his post-World Cup Test season with a decent outing against New Zealand in the 3-match home series. His best effort during the series came in the second innings of the First test at Mohali, where he scored 144 runs, helping India salvage a draw after being bowled out for 83 runs in the First innings. This was Dravid&#x27;s sixth test hundred and his first test hundred in India. Dravid was successful in the 3–2 series win against New Zealand during the bilateral ODI series, scoring 240 runs in 5 games at an average of 60 and a strike rate of 83.62, ending as the second highest scorer in the series. His career best effort in ODIs came in this series in the second game at Hyderabad where he scored run-a-ball 153 runs, which included fifteen fours and two sixes. He set up a 331-run partnership with Tendulkar, which was the largest partnership in terms of runs in ODI cricket history, a record they held for 15 years until it was broken in 2015. In 1999, Dravid scored 1,761 runs in 43 ODIs at an average of 46.34 and a strike rate of 75.16, including 6 hundreds and 8 fifties. He also featured in two 300+-run partnerships.

India toured Australia in December 1999 for a 3-match test series and a triangular ODI tournament. Although Dravid scored a hundred against Tasmania in the practice match, he underperformed with the bat in the Test series as India lost 0–3. He did reasonably well in the 1999–2000 Carlton &amp; United Series, scoring 3 fifties in the triangular event. However, India failed to qualify for the Final of the tournament.

Dravid&#x27;s poor form in Tests continued as India suffered a 0–2 whitewash against South Africa in a home series. He had moderate success in the bilateral ODI series against South Africa. He contributed to India&#x27;s 3–2 series win with 208 runs at an average of 41.60, which included 2 fifties and three wickets at an average of 22.66, topping the bowling average chart for the series. His career best bowling figure of 2/43 from nine overs in the First ODI at Kochi was also the best bowling figure of any bowler in that particular match.

===Rise through the ranks===
In February 2000, Tendulkar&#x27;s resignation from captaincy led to the promotion of Ganguly, the then-vice-captain, as the new captain of the Indian team. In May 2000, while Dravid was busy playing county cricket in England, he was appointed as the vice-captain of the Asia cup Indian team.

India did well in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. The Indian team, which had been involved in a match fixing scandal, defeated Kenya, Australia, and South Africa in consecutive matches to reach the Finals. India lost to New Zealand in the Finals. Dravid scored 157 runs in 4 matches of the tournament, at an average of 52.33, including 2 fifties. He also scored 85 runs in a match against Zimbabwe in the 2000–01 Coca-Cola Champions Trophy while opening the innings but was forced to miss the rest of the tournament because of an injury.

India kick started the new Test season with a 9-wicket win against Bangladesh. Dravid played a brisk knock of 41 runs from 49 balls, including five fours and a six, while chasing a target of 63 runs. The ensuing test series against Zimbabwe was John Wright&#x27;s first assignment as Indian coach. Dravid played a role in Wright&#x27;s appointment as India&#x27;s first foreign head coach. Dravid scored 200 not out in the first inning and 70 not out in the second, leading India to a 9-wicket victory against Zimbabwe. He scored 162 in the drawn Second test to end the series with an average of 432.00, the highest batting average by an Indian in a series across all formats.

Dravid captained the Indian team for the first time in the fifth match of the bilateral ODI series against Zimbabwe in the absence of Ganguly, who was serving suspension. With Agarkar&#x27;s successful performance, Dravid led India to a 39-run victory in his maiden ODI as captain.

===History at Eden===
The Australian team toured India in February 2001. Dravid performed poorly in the first innings of the First Test but displayed strong resilience in Tendulkar&#x27;s company in the second innings. Dravid&#x27;s 196-ball-long resistance finally ended when he got out bowled to Warne for 39 runs. Australians extended their winning streak to 16 Tests as they defeated India by 10 wickets in three days.

During the Second Test at Eden Gardens, the Australians bowled India out for 171 runs in the first innings and enforced a follow-on after securing a lead of 274 runs. In the second innings, Laxman, who had scored a fifty in the first innings, was promoted to the no. 3 position which had been Dravid&#x27;s usual spot, while Dravid, who had gotten bowled out to Warne for a second time in a row in the first innings in just 25 runs, was relegated to no. 6 position. When Dravid joined Laxman in the middle on the third day of the Test the scoreboard read 232/4, with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat.

Dravid and Laxman played out the remaining time on the third day and the whole of the fourth day, denying Australia any wicket on the fourth. Eventually, Laxman got out on the fifth morning, bringing the 376-runs partnership to an end. Ganguly declared the innings at 657/7, setting Australia a target of 384 runs with 75 overs left in the match. India bowled to dismiss Australia for 212 runs in 68.3 overs. India won the match by 171 runs. This was only the third instance of a team winning a Test after following-on, and India became the second team to do so.

Dravid scored 81 runs in the first innings of the Third Test and took 4 catches in the match as India defeated Australia at the series in Chennai 2–1. Dravid scored 80 runs in the first of the 5-match ODI series at his home ground as India won the match by 60 runs. He underperformed in the remaining 4 ODIs as Australia won the series 3–2. Dravid topped the averages for the 2000-01 Test season with 839 runs in six matches at an average of 104.87.

Dravid had a decent outing in Zimbabwe, scoring 137 runs from 134 balls in the First Tour game and aggregating 138 runs at an average of 69.00 from the drawn Test series. In the ensuing triangular ODI series, he aggregated 121 runs from 5 matches at an average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 101.68, the highlight being an unbeaten 72 off 64 balls, while chasing a target of 235 against Zimbabwe in the 3rd match of the series, leading India to a 4-wicket win with four balls to spare. He was adjudged man of the match.

On the next tour to Sri Lanka, India lost the first three matches of the triangular event. In the absence of the suspended Ganguly, Dravid captained the side in the 4th match leading them to their first victory of the series. India won the next two matches to qualify for the Final. Dravid played crucial innings in all three victories. Eventually, India lost the Final to Sri Lanka. He top scored for India in the series with 259 runs from seven matches at an average of 51.80 and a strike rate of 59.81. Reinstated to his usual no. 3 position in the absence of the injured Laxman, Dravid top scored for India in the ensuing 3-Test series as well with 235 runs at an average of 47.00. Dravid scored 75 runs in the fourth innings chase of the Second Test – a crucial contribution to India&#x27;s first Test win in Sri Lanka since 1993, despite the absence of key players like Tendulkar, Laxman, Srinath and Kumble.

Dravid had decent success in Standard Bank tri-series in the South Africa tour, scoring 214 runs (including 3 fifties) at an average of 53.50 and a strike rate of 71.81. He also kept wickets in the final two ODIs of the series, effecting 3 stumpings. The highlight for Dravid in the ensuing Test series came in the second innings of the Second Test. India, having failed to last a hundred overs in any of the previous three innings in the series, needed to bat out four sessions in the Second Test to win the match. They started by not performing successfully, losing their first wicket in the first over with no runs scored. However, Dravid forged a partnership of 171 runs with Dasgupta that lasted for 83.2 overs, taking India to the brink of safety. Poor weather helped India salvage a draw as only 96.2 overs could be bowled in the innings. Dravid captained the team in the &#x27;unofficial&#x27; Third test in the absence of injured Ganguly, which India lost by an innings margin.

By the end of the South African tour, Dravid had started experiencing problems with his right shoulder. Although he played the ensuing home test series against England, he pulled out of the six-match bilateral ODI series to undergo a shoulder rehabilitation program in South Africa. He returned for Zimbabwe&#x27;s tour of India but performed below par, scoring a fifty each in the Test series and the bilateral ODI series.

===2002–2006: Peak years===
Dravid hit the peak form of his career in 2002. Between the 2002 and the 2006 series, Dravid was the second-highest scorer overall and top scorer for India across formats, scoring 8,914 runs from 174 matches at an average of 54.02, including 19 hundreds.

Dravid had a successful outing in the West Indies in 2002. The highlights for him included hitting a hundred with a swollen jaw and helping India avoid the follow-on at Georgetown in the drawn First Test. Contributing with a fifty and four catches to India&#x27;s victory in the Second Test at the Port of Spain – India&#x27;s first Test victory in the West Indies since 1975–76 – and another fifty in the drawn Fourth Test with a wicket to boot, that of Ridley Jacobs who was batting on 118. This was Dravid&#x27;s only wicket in Test cricket. He played as India&#x27;s designated keeper in the ODI series but didn&#x27;t contribute much with the bat in the 2–1 series win.

===A quartet of hundreds===
India&#x27;s tour of England in 2002 started with a triangular ODI event involving India, England and Sri Lanka. India emerged as the winner of the series, defeating England in the Final – their first victory after nine consecutive defeats in one-day finals. Dravid played as designated keeper in six out of seven matches, effecting nine dismissals (6 catches, 3 stumpings) – the most by a keeper in the series. He also performed well with the bat, aggregating 245 runs at an average of 49.00, including three fifties. His performance against Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI (64 runs, 1 catch) earned him a man of the match award.

India lost the first of the four match Test series. Having conceded a 260 runs lead in the first innings of the Second Test at Nottingham, the Indian team was in a spot of bother. However, Dravid led the fightback in the second innings with a hundred runs scored as the Indian team managed to earn a draw.

Ganguly won the toss in the Third Test and decided to bat first on an overcast morning at Headingley, on a pitch known to be traditionally conducive for fast and swing bowling. Having lost an early wicket, Dravid &quot;weathered the storm&quot; in the company of Sanjay Bangar. They played cautiously, taking body blows on a pitch with uneven bounce. Dravid completed his second hundred of the series in the process. The Indian team declared the innings on 628/8 and then bowled England out twice to register their first test victory in England since 1986. Despite being outscored by Tendulkar, Dravid was named man of the match for his efforts. Dravid scored a double hundred in the drawn Fourth Test and earned his second consecutive man of the match award of the series. Christopher Martin-Jenkins noted during the Fourth Test: Dravid aggregated 602 runs in the series from four matches at an average of 100.33, including three hundreds and a fifty, and was adjudged joint man of the series along with Michael Vaughan.

India jointly shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. Dravid contributed to India&#x27;s successful campaign with 120 runs at an average of 60.00 and five dismissals behind the wicket. Dravid scored a hundred in the First Test of the three match home series against the West Indies, becoming the first Indian batsman to score hundreds in four consecutive Test innings, but had to retire soon after owing to severe cramps. Dravid performed well in the subsequent bilateral 7-match ODI series aggregating 300 runs at an average of 75.00 and a strike rate of 89.82, including a hundred and two fifties. He also effected 7 dismissals (6 catches, 1 stumping) in the series. India was trailing 1–2 and needed 325 runs to win the Fourth ODI and level the series. Dravid scored a hundred, leading India to a successful chase. He once again scored a crucial fifty in the Sixth ODI as India once again leveled the series after trailing 2–3. India, however, lost the last match to lose the series 3–4.

Dravid top scored for India in the two-match Test series in New Zealand as India&#x27;s team slumped to a whitewash. He played as designated keeper in six of the 7-match bilateral ODI series and effected seven dismissals but fared poorly with the bat as India was handed a 2-5 drubbing by New Zealand.

===2003 Cricket World Cup===
Dravid arrived in South Africa with the Indian squad to participate in the 2003 Cricket World Cup in the capacity of first-choice keeper-batsman as part of their &quot;seven batsmen-four bowlers&quot; strategy – an experiment that had brought success to the team during the prior year. The idea was that making Dravid keep wickets allowed India to accommodate an extra specialist batsman. The strategy worked well for India in the World Cup. India recovered from a less than convincing victory against the Netherlands and a loss to Australia in the league stage, winning eight consecutive matches to qualify for the World Cup Finals for the first time since 1983. India eventually lost the Final to Australia, finishing as runner-up in the tournament. Dravid contributed to India&#x27;s campaign with 318 runs at an average of 63.60 and 16 dismissals (15 catches, 1 stumping). Highlights for Dravid in the tournament included a fifty against England, 44 not out against Pakistan in a successful chase, and an undefeated fifty in another successful chase against New Zealand.

Dravid topped the international runs chart for the 2003-04 cricket season across formats, aggregating 1,993 runs from 31 matches at an average of 64.29, including three double hundreds. The first match involved India and New Zealand, in the first of the two-test home series at Ahmedabad. Dravid scored 222 runs in the first innings and 73 runs in the second innings, receiving a man of the match award for his efforts. Dravid captained the Indian Test Team for the first time in the second game of the series at Mohali in the absence of Ganguly. Both matches ended in draws. Dravid top scored in the series with 313 runs at an average of 78.25. India next participated in the TVS cup alongside New Zealand and Australia. India lost to Australia in the Final. Dravid scored two fifties in the series but the highlight was his fifty against New Zealand in the ninth match that came in just 22 balls – the second fastest fifty by an Indian.

===An Eden encore===

After earning a draw in the first of the four-match Test series in Australia, the Indian team found itself reeling at 85/4 in the Second Test at Adelaide, after Australia had piled 556 runs in the first innings when Laxman joined Dravid in the middle. They batted for 93.5 overs, bringing about their second 300-run partnership, adding 303 runs together before Laxman perished for 148 runs. However, Dravid continued to complete his second double hundred of the season. He was the last man out for 233 runs as India conceded a marginal first innings lead of 33 runs to Australia. India bowled Australia out for a score of only 196, with the help of Agarkar&#x27;s six-wicket haul, and were set a target of 230 runs to win the match. Dravid scored a fifty as India registered their first test victory in Australia since the 1980–81 season, reaching 1–0 in the series. This was the first time that Australians were 0–1 down in a home series since 1994. Dravid won the man of the match award for his efforts. He registered a score of ninety each in the next two tests, as Australia leveled the series to 1–1. Dravid top scored for India in the series with 619 runs at an average of 123.80 and was awarded player of the series for his efforts.

Dravid performed moderately well in the ensuing VB series with three fifties in the league stage, all of which came in winning cause. However, India lost the best-of-three finals to Australia 2–0. Dravid was fined half his match fee for applying cough lozenge on the ball during a match in the series against Zimbabwe – an act that was claimed was an innocent mistake.

India visited Pakistan in March 2004 to participate in a bilateral Test series for the first time since the 1989–90 season. Prior to the Test series, India played and won the 5-match ODI series 3–2. Dravid top scored for India in the series with 248 runs at an average of 62.00 and a strike rate of 73.59, and effected four dismissals (3 catches, 1 stumping). His contributions included 99 runs in the First ODI and a fifty during a successful chase in the Fourth ODI.

Dravid captained India in the first two of the ensuing three-match test series in the absence of Ganguly, who was injured, and led India to their first-ever Test victory in Pakistan. In only his second test as the team&#x27;s captain, Dravid took a controversial decision during the First Test at Multan, declaring Indian innings at the fall of the fifth wicket, with the scoreboard reading 675/5 and Tendulkar unbeaten at 194, just six runs shy of a double hundred. He wanted to play against the exhausted Pakistani batsmen, who had been on the field for 150+ overs, in the final hour of the second day&#x27;s play. While some praised the &quot;team-before-personal-milestones&quot; approach of the Indian captain, others criticized Dravid&#x27;s timing of declaration as there were no pressing concerns and there was ample time left in the match to try to bowl Pakistan out twice. While Tendulkar was admittedly disappointed, both he and Dravid and the team&#x27;s management denied any rumours of a rift between them, and claimed that the matter had been discussed and sorted amicably behind closed doors. India eventually went on to win the match by an innings margin. Pakistan leveled the series, defeating India in the Second Test. Dravid scored a double hundred in the Third Test at Rawalpindi – his third double hundred of the season. He scored 270 runs – his career best performance – before playing a reverse sweep, trying to force the pace. India went on to win the match and the series – their first series victory outside India since 1993 and first victory ever in Pakistan. Dravid was adjudged man of the match for his effort. He topped the international averages for 2003-04 Test season with 1,241 runs from nine tests at an average of 95.46.

India reached the Finals of the 2004 Asia Cup, where they lost to Sri Lanka. Dravid scored a hundred against the U.A.E., which earned him a man of the match award, and a fifty against Sri Lanka in the tournament along with five dismissals behind the wicket. He did not make any significant contribution with the bat in the ensuing Videocon Cup, but scored a fifty in the 3-match bilateral ODI series in England and top scored for India in the failed campaign at the 2004 ICC Champion&#x27;s Trophy.

Dravid did not perform well in the ensuing Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home, scoring only one fifty in four matches as India went on to lose the series, but contributed two fifties to India&#x27;s 1–0 victory in the 2-match home test series against South Africa. Sandwiched between the two test series, India played a solitary ODI against Pakistan at home to mark the 75th anniversary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The match turned out to be Dravid&#x27;s last ODI as the designated wicket keeper. In all, Dravid effected 84 dismissals (71 catches, 13 stumpings) in 73 matches as India&#x27;s designated keeper, which is the fourth highest score behind Dhoni, Mongia and More. Dravid had a good outing in Bangladesh, where he scored a hundred in the Test series and two fifties in the ODI series, with India winning both series.

In 2005, Dravid represented Asia XI against the ICC World XI at the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal. He top scored for Asia XI with a fifty but could not take his team to victory against the ICC World XI. Pakistan visited India in March 2005 for bilateral a Test and ODI series. Dravid scored two hundreds and a fifty in the 3-match Test series as both teams drew the series 1-1. He scored both hundreds during the Second Test (110 in First innings and 135 in Second innings), making him only the second Indian and ninth person to have scored two hundreds in the same test on two or more occasions. Dravid earned this match&#x27;s man of the match award for his performance. Dravid topped the runs chart in the 6-match ODI series with 308 runs at an average of 51.33 and a strike rate of 80.00, including a hundred and two fifties. He also captained the team in the final two ODIs in the absence of Ganguly but could not prevent his team from losing 2–4 against Pakistan.

==Captaincy==
Dravid was appointed as captain of the Indian team for the 2007 World Cup, during which India was defeated.
During India&#x27;s unsuccessful tour of England in 2011, in which their 4–0 loss cost them the top rank in Test cricket, Dravid scored three centuries.
===2011 Tour of England===
Having regained his form on the tour to the West Indies, where he scored a match-winning hundred in Sabina park, Jamaica, Dravid then toured England in what was billed as the series that would decide the World No. 1 ranking in tests.
In the first test at Lord&#x27;s, in reply to England&#x27;s 474, Dravid scored an undefeated 103, his first hundred at the ground where he debuted in 1996. He received scant support from his teammates as India&#x27;s team was bowled out for 286 and lost the test. The second test at Trentbridge in Nottingham again saw Dravid in successful form. Sent out to open the batting in place of an injured Gautam Gambhir, he scored his second successive hundred. His score of 117 again did not secure the team&#x27;s victory, as a collapse of 6 wickets for 21 runs in the first innings led to a defeat by 319 runs. Dravid failed in both innings in the third test at Birmingham, as India lost by an innings and 242 runs, one of the heaviest defeats in their history. However, during the fourth and final match at The Oval, he opened the batting in place of Gambhir, and scored an undefeated 146 out of India&#x27;s total of 300, carrying his bat through the innings. Once again, though, his efforts were in vain as India lost the match in a 0–4 whitewash.
In total, he scored 461 runs in the four matches at an average of 76.83 with three hundreds. He accounted for over 26% of India&#x27;s runs in the series and was named India&#x27;s man of the series by English coach Andy Flower. Dravid&#x27;s performance in the series was met with admiration.

===Retirement===
Rahul Dravid was dropped from the ODI team in 2009, but was selected again for an ODI series in England in 2011, surprising even Dravid himself since, although he had not officially retired from ODI cricket, he had not expected to be recalled. After being selected, he announced that he would retire from ODI cricket after the series. He played his last ODI innings against England at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, on 16 September 2011, scoring 69 runs from 79 balls before being bowled by Graeme Swann. His last limited-overs international match was his debut T20I match; he announced his retirement before playing his first T20I match.

Dravid announced his retirement from Test and domestic cricket on 9 March 2012, after the 2011–12 tour of Australia, but he said that he would captain the Rajasthan Royals in the 2012 Indian Premier League. He was the second-highest run scorer and had taken the highest number of catches in Test cricket at the time of his retirement.

In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.

==Coaching==
Towards the end of his playing career, Dravid took on a role as mentor to the Rajasthan Royals&#x27; IPL team in 2014. During this time, he also became involved with the Indian national team, serving as mentor during the team&#x27;s tour of England in 2014. After leading the Royals to a third-place finish in the 2015 IPL season, he was appointed as the head coach of the India U-19 and India A teams. Dravid achieved success as coach, with the U-19s reaching the finals of the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup. Two years later, the team went on to win the 2018 U-19 Cricket World Cup, defeating Australia by 8 wickets to win their fourth Under-19 World Cup, the most by any national side. Dravid was credited with training future national team players including Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan and Washington Sundar. Alongside his coaching roles, Dravid took on several mentor roles, including at the Delhi Daredevils IPL team.

In July 2019, following his four-year stint as coach of the junior teams, Dravid was appointed Head of Cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). He was in charge of &quot;overseeing all cricket related activities at NCA was involved in mentoring, coaching, training and motivating players, coaches and support staff at the NCA&quot;. As head of NCA, he was praised for maintaining the senior team and revamping player fitness and rehabilitation regiments.

In November 2021, he was appointed as head coach of the Indian national cricket team.

==County stint==
Dravid had always been keen on further honing his batting skills in testing English conditions by playing in county cricket. He had discussed the prospects regarding the same with former New Zealand cricketer and incumbent Kent coach John Wright during India&#x27;s 1998–99 tour of New Zealand. Wright was particularly impressed with Dravid&#x27;s performance on that tour, especially with his twin hundreds at Hamilton. The talks finally materialized and Dravid made his county debut for Kent in April 2000. His co-debutante Ganguly made his county debuted in the same match, albeit for the opposite team.

Kent&#x27;s offer had come as a welcome change for Dravid. There was too much negativity surrounding Indian cricket marred by the match fixing controversy. Dravid himself had been struggling to score runs in Tests for a while. The county stint gave him a chance to &quot;get away to a new environment&quot; and &quot;relax&quot;. The wide variety of pitches and weather conditions in England and a full season of intense county cricket against professional cricketers gave him a chance to further his cricketing training.

In his 2nd game for Kent, Dravid scored a 182 runs, propelling them to an innings and a 163-runs victory over the touring Zimbabwe team. Out of 7 first class tour games that Zimbabwe played on that tour, Kent was the only team that defeated them. Dravid hit another fifty runs in a draw against Surrey. The newly appointed vice-captain had to leave the county championship temporarily, missing two championship games and two one-day games, to fulfill his national commitment. The Indian team, Dravid included, fared poorly in the Asia Cup and failed to qualify for the Final. Subsequently, Dravid returned to England to resume his county sojourn with Kent.

In July 2000, Kent&#x27;s away match against Hampshire at Portsmouth was billed as a showdown between two great cricketers – Warne and Dravid. Dravid came out on top. On a dustbowl, tailor-made to suit home team spinners, Warne took 4 wickets but could not take Dravid&#x27;s. Coming in to bat at 15/2, Dravid faced 295 balls, scoring 137 runs – his maiden hundred in county championships. Dravid scored 73 not out in the second innings, leading Kent to a six wicket victory as Warne went wicketless.

In their last county game of the season, Kent needed one bonus point to prevent themselves from being relegated to the Second Division. Dravid made sure they stayed put in the First Division by winning the necessary bonus point with an inning of 77 runs.

Dravid concluded a successful stint with Kent, aggregating 1,221 runs from 16 first-class matches (15 county games and 1 tour game against Zimbabwe) at an average of 55.50, including 2 hundreds and 8 fifties. He shouldered Kent&#x27;s batting single-handedly as the second best Kent batsman. Dravid contributed to Kent&#x27;s county campaign not only with the bat but also with his fielding and bowling, taking 14 catches and 4 wickets at an average of 32.00.

==Indian Premier League and Champions League==

Rahul Dravid played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2008, 2009 and 2010. Later he played for the Rajasthan Royals and led them to the finals of Champions League T20 in 2013, and play-offs of the Indian Premier League in 2013. Dravid announced retirement from Twenty20 after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013.

==Playing style==
Dravid is known for his technique, and has been one of the most successful batsmen of the Indian cricket team. Early in his career, he was known as a defensive batsman who was best at playing Test cricket, and was dropped from the ODI squad due to a low strike rate. However, he later improved his ability to score well in ODIs, earning him the ICC Player of the Year award. His nickname of &#x27;The Wall&#x27; in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname. Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket, with an average of 52.31; this includes five double centuries. In one-dayers, he averaged 39.16, with a strike rate of 71.23. He is one of the few Indians whose Test average is better while playing away than at home, averaging almost five runs more on foreign pitches. As of 23 September 2010, Dravid&#x27;s Test average abroad is 55.53, while his Test average at home is 50.76; his ODI average abroad is 37.93 and his ODI average at home is 43.11. Dravid averages 66.34 runs in Indian Test victories. and 50.69 runs in ODIs.

Dravid&#x27;s sole Test wicket was of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test match against the West Indies during the 2001–2002 series. Dravid often kept wickets for India in ODIs.

Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with Sourav Ganguly, the first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership, and a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is a world record. He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings played since debut before being dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270, respectively.

He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2000. Though primarily a defensive batsman, Dravid scored 50 runs not out in 22 balls (a strike rate of 227.27) against New Zealand in Hyderabad on 15 November 2003, the second fastest 50 among Indian batsmen.

In 2004, Dravid was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. On 7 September 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Player of the year award and the Test player of the year award by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

After reaching the 10,000 Test runs milestone, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s a proud moment for sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back, I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years. I never had an ambition to do it because I never believed – it is just a reflection of my longevity in the game.&quot;

Dravid is also one of only two batsmen to score 10,000 runs at a single batting position and is the fourth highest run scorer in Test cricket, behind Tendulkar, Ponting and Kallis.

==Controversies==
===Ball-tampering incident===
In January 2004, Dravid was found guilty of ball tampering during an ODI with Zimbabwe. Match referee Clive Lloyd adjudged the application of an energy sweet to the ball as a deliberate offence, although Dravid himself denied this was his intent. Lloyd emphasised that television footage caught Dravid putting a lozenge on the ball during the Zimbabwean innings on Tuesday night at the Gabba. According to the ICC&#x27;s Code of Conduct, players are not allowed to apply substances to a ball other than sweat and saliva. Dravid was fined half of his match fee.

Indian coach John Wright defended Dravid, stating that &quot;It was an innocent mistake&quot;. Wright argued that Dravid had been trying to apply saliva to the ball when parts of a losenge he had been chewing stuck to the ball; Dravid then tried to wipe it off. ICC regulations prevented Dravid from commenting about the issue, but former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly also stated that Dravid&#x27;s act was &quot;just an accident&quot;.

===Captaincy===
Rahul Dravid has had a mixed record when leading India in Tests.

One of Dravid&#x27;s most debated decisions was taken in March 2004, when he was standing in as the captain for injured Sourav Ganguly. India&#x27;s first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 runs not out with 16 overs remaining on Day 2. In this test match Sehwag scored a triple century for the first time in his career. He became the first Indian to score a triple century in test cricket with a score of 309.

In March 2006, India lost the Mumbai Test, giving England its first Test victory in India since 1985, enabling it to draw the series 1–1. Some argued that the defeat in Mumbai the result of Dravid&#x27;s decision to bowl first on a flat dry pitch, which later deteriorated and ended with an Indian collapse in the run chase. Coincidentally, it was Dravid&#x27;s 100th test match in which the Indians were all out for 100 runs in the second innings.

After India failed to qualify for the final of the DLF Cup, Dravid, the skipper, was criticised by former all-rounder Ravi Shastri who said that he was not assertive enough and allowed Greg Chappell make too many decisions. When asked for a response, Dravid said that Shastri, while a &#x27;fair critic&#x27;, was &#x27;not privy&#x27; to the internal decision-making process of the team.

He was criticised by Vijay Mallya for not correctly balancing his team after his then-IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore finished seventh out of the eight teams that participated in the 2008 season.

<text>Street reclaiming is the process of converting, or otherwise returning streets to a stronger focus on non-car use — such as walking, cycling and active street life. It is advocated by many urban planners and urban economists, of widely varying political points of view. Its primary benefits are thought to be:

*Decreased automobile traffic with less noise pollution, fewer automobile accidents, reduced smog and air pollution
*Greater safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists
*Less frequent surface maintenance than car-driven roads
*Reduced summer temperatures due to less asphalt and more green spaces
*Increased pedestrian traffic which also increases social and commercial opportunities
*Increased gardening space for urban residents
*Better support for co-housing and infirm residents, e.g. suburban eco-villages built around former streets

==Campaigns==
An early example of street reclamation was the Stockholm carfree day in 1969.

Some consider the best advantages to be gained by redesigning streets, for example as shared space, while others, such as campaigns like &quot;Reclaim the Streets&quot;, a widespread &quot;dis-organization&quot;, run a variety of events to physically reclaim the streets for political and artistic actions, often called street parties. David Engwicht is also a strong proponent of the concept that street life, rather than physical redesign, is the primary tool of street reclamation.

<doc id="252738" wikidata="Q2390323" url="?curid=252738" title="Unit disk">
<text>In mathematics, the open unit disk (or disc) around &quot;P&quot; (where &quot;P&quot; is a given point in the plane), is the set of points whose distance from &quot;P&quot; is less than 1:

:formula_1

The closed unit disk around &quot;P&quot; is the set of points whose distance from &quot;P&quot; is less than or equal to one:

:formula_2

Unit disks are special cases of disks and unit balls; as such, they contain the interior of the unit circle and, in the case of the closed unit disk, the unit circle itself.

Without further specifications, the term &quot;unit disk&quot; is used for the open unit disk about the origin, formula_3, with respect to the standard Euclidean metric. It is the interior of a circle of radius 1, centered at the origin. This set can be identified with the set of all complex numbers of absolute value less than one. When viewed as a subset of the complex plane (C), the unit disk is often denoted formula_4.

== The open unit disk, the plane, and the upper half-plane ==
The function

:formula_5

is an example of a real analytic and bijective function from the open unit disk to the plane; its inverse function is also analytic. Considered as a real 2-dimensional analytic manifold, the open unit disk is therefore isomorphic to the whole plane. In particular, the open unit disk is homeomorphic to the whole plane.

There is however no conformal bijective map between the open unit disk and the plane. Considered as a Riemann surface, the open unit disk is therefore different from the complex plane.

There are conformal bijective maps between the open unit disk and the open upper half-plane. So considered as a Riemann surface, the open unit disk is isomorphic (&quot;biholomorphic&quot;, or &quot;conformally equivalent&quot;) to the upper half-plane, and the two are often used interchangeably.

Much more generally, the Riemann mapping theorem states that every simply connected open subset of the complex plane that is different from the complex plane itself admits a conformal and bijective map to the open unit disk.

One bijective conformal map from the open unit disk to the open upper half-plane is the Möbius transformation

:formula_6   which is the inverse of the Cayley transform.

Geometrically, one can imagine the real axis being bent and shrunk so that the upper half-plane becomes the disk&#x27;s interior and the real axis forms the disk&#x27;s circumference, save for one point at the top, the &quot;point at infinity&quot;. A bijective conformal map from the open unit disk to the open upper half-plane can also be constructed as the composition of two stereographic projections: first the unit disk is stereographically projected upward onto the unit upper half-sphere, taking the &quot;south-pole&quot; of the unit sphere as the projection center, and then this half-sphere is projected sideways onto a vertical half-plane touching the sphere, taking the point on the half-sphere opposite to the touching point as projection center.

The unit disk and the upper half-plane are not interchangeable as domains for Hardy spaces. Contributing to this difference is the fact that the unit circle has finite (one-dimensional) Lebesgue measure while the real line does not.

==Hyperbolic plane==
The open unit disk forms the set of points for the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane. Circular arcs perpendicular to the unit circle form the &quot;lines&quot; in this model. The unit circle is the Cayley absolute that determines a metric on the disk through use of cross-ratio in the style of the Cayley–Klein metric. In the language of differential geometry, the circular arcs perpendicular to the unit circle are geodesics that show the shortest distance between points in the model. The model includes motions which are expressed by the special unitary group SU(1,1). The disk model can be transformed to the Poincaré half-plane model by the mapping &quot;g&quot; given above.

Both the Poincaré disk and the Poincaré half-plane are &quot;conformal&quot; models of the hyperbolic plane, which is to say that angles between intersecting curves are preserved by motions of their isometry groups.

Another model of hyperbolic space is also built on the open unit disk: the Beltrami-Klein model. It is &quot;not conformal&quot;, but has the property that the geodesics are straight lines.

== Unit disks with respect to other metrics ==

One also considers unit disks with respect to other metrics. For instance, with the taxicab metric and the Chebyshev metric disks look like squares (even though the underlying topologies are the same as the Euclidean one).

The area of the Euclidean unit disk is π and its perimeter is 2π. In contrast, the perimeter (relative to the taxicab metric) of the unit disk in the taxicab geometry is 8. In 1932, Stanisław Gołąb proved that in metrics arising from a norm, the perimeter of the unit disk can take any value in between 6 and 8, and that these extremal values are obtained if and only if the unit disk is a regular hexagon or a parallelogram, respectively.

<doc id="252740" wikidata="Q26597" url="?curid=252740" title="Long-tailed duck">
<text>The long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) or coween, formerly known as the oldsquaw, is a medium-sized sea duck that breeds in the tundra and taiga regions of the arctic and winters along the northern coastlines of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is the only member of the genus Clangula.

==Taxonomy==
The long-tailed duck was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas hyemalis&quot;. Linnaeus cited the English naturalist George Edwards&#x27;s description and illustration of the &quot;Long-tailed duck from Hudson&#x27;s-Bay&quot; that had been published in 1750 in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;.

This duck is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Clangula&quot;; the genus was introduced in 1819 by the English zoologist William Leach to accommodate the long-tailed duck, in an appendix on species to John Ross&#x27;s account of his voyage to look for the Northwest Passage. The genus name &quot;Clangula&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;clangere&quot;, meaning &quot;to resound&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;hyemalis&quot;, also Latin, means &quot;of winter&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic – no subspecies are recognised.

In North American English it is sometimes called &quot;oldsquaw&quot;, though this name has fallen out of favour. In 2000, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) formally adopted the name &quot;long-tailed duck&quot;, in response to petitioning by a group of biologists who feared that the former name would be offensive to Native American tribes whose help was required for conservation efforts. The AOU stated that &quot;political correctness&quot; alone was not sufficient to justify changing a long-standing name, but in this case decided to make the change because doing so would &quot;conform with English usage in other parts of the world&quot;.

An undescribed congener is known from the Middle Miocene Sajóvölgyi Formation (Late Badenian, 13–12 Mya) of Mátraszőlős, Hungary.

==Distribution==
Long-tailed ducks breed on tundra across northern Eurasia (in Russian Siberia, Kamchatka, and Karelia, for example), the Faroe Islands, Finland, parts of southern Greenland, Iceland, Norway, as well as across northern North America (Alaska and northern Canada).

In winter, they are found on and near large bodies of seawater, such as the Northern Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean, Hudson Bay and the American Great Lakes. Small numbers are found on the Missouri river

==Description==

Adults have white underparts, though the rest of the plumage goes through a complex moulting process. The male has a long pointed tail ( long) and a dark grey bill crossed by a pink band. In winter, the male has a dark cheek patch on a mainly white head and neck, a dark breast and mostly white body. In summer, the male is dark on the head, neck and back with a white cheek patch. The female has a brown back and a relatively short pointed tail. In winter, the female&#x27;s head and neck are white with a dark crown. In summer, the head is dark. Juveniles resemble adult females in autumn plumage, though with a lighter, less distinct cheek patch.

The males are vocal and have a musical yodelling call &quot;ow, ow, owal-ow&quot;.

==Behaviour==


===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is in tundra pools and marshes, but also along sea coasts and in large mountain lakes in the North Atlantic region, Alaska, northern Canada, northern Europe, and Russia. The nest is located on the ground near water; it is built using vegetation and lined with down. They are migratory and winter along the eastern and western coasts of North America, on the Great Lakes, coastal northern Europe and Asia, with stragglers to the Black Sea. The most important wintering area is the Baltic Sea, where a total of about 4.5 million gather. As of 2022 it has also been breeding in parts of Western Europe, such as on the Marker Wadden in the Netherlands.

===Food and feeding===
The long-tailed duck is gregarious, forming large flocks in winter and during migration. They feed by diving for mollusks, crustaceans and some small fish. Although they usually feed close to the surface, they are capable of diving to depths of . According to the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds they can dive to 80 fathoms (146 metres or 480 feet). They use their wings, like velvet scoters, to dive, which gives them the ability to dive much deeper than other ducks.

==Status==
The long-tailed duck is still hunted across a large part of its range. There has been a significant decline in the number of birds wintering in the Baltic Sea, partly due to their susceptibility to being trapped in gillnets. For these reasons the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has categorised the long-tailed duck as vulnerable. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="252748" wikidata="Q14811107" url="?curid=252748" title="Taps (bugle call)">
<text>&quot;Taps&quot; is a bugle call sounded to signal &quot;lights out&quot; at the end of a military day, and during patriotic memorial ceremonies and military funerals conducted by the United States Armed Forces. The official military version is played by a single bugle or trumpet, although other versions of the tune may be played in other contexts (e.g., the U.S. Marine Corps Ceremonial Music site has recordings of two bugle versions and one band version). It is also performed often at Girl Guide, Girl Scout, and Boy Scout meetings and camps. The tune is also sometimes known as &quot;Butterfield″s Lullaby&quot;, or by the first line of the lyric, &quot;Day Is Done&quot;. The duration may vary to some extent.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Taps&quot; is derived from the same source as &quot;Tattoo&quot;. &quot;Taps&quot; is sometimes said to originate from the Dutch &quot;taptoe&quot;, meaning &quot;close the [beer] taps [and send the troops back to camp]&quot;. An alternative explanation, however, is that it carried over from a term already in use before the American Civil War. Three single, slow drum beats were struck after the sounding of the Tattoo or &quot;Extinguish Lights&quot;. This signal was known as the &quot;Drum Taps&quot;, &quot;The Taps&quot;, or simply as &quot;Taps&quot; in soldiers&#x27; slang.

== History ==
The tune is a variation of an earlier bugle call known as the &quot;Scott Tattoo&quot;, which was used in the U.S. from 1835 until 1860. It was arranged in its present form by the Union Army Brigadier General Daniel Butterfield, a Medal of Honor recipient. Butterfield commanded the 3d Brigade, 1st Division, V Army Corps, Army of the Potomac while at Harrison&#x27;s Landing, Virginia in July 1862, and wrote it to replace the customary firing of three rifle volleys at the end of burials during battle. Butterfield&#x27;s version in July 1862 replaced a previous French bugle call used to signal &quot;lights out&quot;. Butterfield&#x27;s bugler, Oliver Wilcox Norton, of East Springfield, Pennsylvania, was the first to sound the new call. Within months &quot;Taps&quot; was used by both Union and Confederate forces. It was officially recognized by the United States Army in 1874.

Captain John C. Tidball, West Point Class of 1848, started the custom of playing &quot;Taps&quot; at military funerals. In early July 1862 at Harrison&#x27;s Landing, a corporal of Tidball&#x27;s Battery A, 2nd U.S. Artillery, died. He was, Tidball recalled later, &quot;a most excellent man&quot;. Tidball wished to bury him with full military honors, but, for military reasons, he was refused permission to fire seven rifles three times over the grave. Tidball later wrote, &quot;The thought suggested itself to me to sound &#x27;Taps&#x27; instead, which I did. The idea was taken up by others, until in a short time it was adopted by the entire army and is now looked upon as the most appropriate and touching part of a military funeral.&quot; As Tidball proudly proclaimed, &quot;Battery A has the honor of having introduced this custom into the service, and it is worthy of historical note.&quot;

It became a standard component to U.S. military funerals in 1891.

==Use==
Taps concludes military funerals that are conducted with honors at Arlington National Cemetery and elsewhere. The tune is also sounded at memorial services in Arlington&#x27;s Memorial Amphitheater and at grave sites throughout the cemetery. Taps concludes about 15 military funerals conducted with honors each weekday at Arlington National Cemetery (run by the U.S. Army), at nearly 200 other National Cemeteries (run by the Department of Veterans Affairs) around the country, and at Cemeteries overseas run by the American Battle Monuments Commission. The tune is also sounded at memorial services in the Amphitheater and at gravesites. Taps is sounded every evening at 23:00 (11:00pm) at the Tomb of the Unknowns, as well as during the 2,500 military wreath ceremonies conducted there every year. The ceremonies are viewed by many groups, including veterans, schools, and foreign officials. 

The final bugle call of the day on military installations, Taps is played at military bases as a signal to service members that it is quiet time or &quot;lights out&quot;. The time varies between branches and individual bases: either 21:00, 22:00, or 23:00 (9, 10, or 11pm). When Taps is played, it is customary to salute, if in uniform, or place your hand over your heart if not — it is a moment to reflect and honor those who gave their lives while serving. 

Taps is sounded during each of the military wreath ceremonies conducted at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every year, including the ones held on Memorial Day. The ceremonies are viewed by many people, including veterans, school groups, and foreign officials. Taps also is sounded nightly in military installations at non-deployed locations to indicate that it is &quot;lights out&quot;, and often by Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Girl Guides to mark the end of an evening event such as a campfire.

== Melody and lyrics ==
The melody of &quot;Taps&quot; is composed entirely from the written notes of the C major triad (i.e., C, E, and G, with the G used in the lower and higher octaves). This is because the bugle, for which it is written, can play only the notes in the harmonic series of the instrument&#x27;s fundamental tone; a B-flat bugle thus plays the notes B-flat, D, and F. &quot;Taps&quot; uses the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth partials.
&quot;Taps&quot; is a bugle call—a signal, not a song. As such, there is no associated lyric. Many bugle calls had words associated with them as a mnemonic device but these are not lyrics. Horace Lorenzo Trim is often credited for a set of words intended to accompany the music:

&lt;poem&gt;
Day is done, gone the sun,
 From the lake, from the hills, from the sky;
 All is well, safely rest, God is nigh.

Fading light, dims the sight,
 And a star gems the sky, gleaming bright.
 From afar, drawing nigh, falls the night.

Thanks and praise, for our days,
 &#x27;Neath the sun, &#x27;neath the stars, neath the sky;
 As we go, this we know, God is nigh.

Sun has set, shadows come,
 Time has fled, Scouts must go to their beds
 Always true to the promise that they made.

While the light fades from sight,
 And the stars gleaming rays softly send,
 To thy hands we our souls, Lord, commend.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Several later lyrical adaptations have been created. Girl Guides in the UK usually sing &quot;from the sea&quot; not &quot;from the lake&quot;.

== Legends ==
There are several legends concerning the origin of &quot;Taps&quot;. The most widely circulated one states that a Union Army infantry officer, whose name often is given as Captain Robert Ellicombe, first ordered &quot;Taps&quot; performed at the funeral of his son, a Confederate soldier killed during the Peninsula Campaign. This apocryphal story claims that Ellicombe found the tune in the pocket of his son&#x27;s clothing and performed it to honor his memory, but there is no record of any man named Robert Ellicombe holding a commission as captain in the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign.

That Daniel Butterfield composed &quot;Taps&quot; has been sworn to by numerous reputable witnesses including his bugler Norton, who first performed the tune. While scholars continue to debate whether or not the tune was original or based on an earlier melody, few researchers doubt that Butterfield is responsible for the current tune.

Another, perhaps more historically verifiable, account of &quot;Taps&quot; first being used in the context of a military funeral involves John C. Tidball, a Union artillery captain who during a break in fighting ordered the tune sounded for a deceased soldier in lieu of the more traditional—and much less discreet—three volley tribute. Army Col. James A. Moss, in an Officer&#x27;s Manual initially published in 1911, reports the following:

During the Peninsula Campaign in 1862, a soldier of Tidball&#x27;s Battery A of the 2nd Artillery was buried at a time when the battery occupied an advanced position concealed in the woods. It was not safe to fire the customary three volleys over the grave, on account of the proximity of the enemy, and it occurred to Capt. Tidball that the sounding of Taps would be the most appropriate ceremony that could be substituted.

While not necessarily addressing the origin of &quot;Taps&quot;, this does represent the first recorded instance of &quot;Taps&quot; being sounded as part of a military funeral. Until then, while the tune had meant that the soldiers&#x27; day of work was finished, it had little to none of the connotation or overtone of death, with which it so often is associated today.

Another lesser-known legend is that of Lieutenant William Waid paying saloon-keepers to shut off the taps to the kegs when the song was played in a neighboring army camp. Lt. Waid&#x27;s name has not been found in Union or Confederate records.

== Non-military variants ==
Although primarily used within the military, several local or special variations of the tune are performed, primarily by organizations such as the Girl Scouts of the USA or American military schools. It is also played all over the world in remembrance of the dead.

=== Echo Taps and Silver Taps ===
Echo Taps or Silver Taps is a tradition in which &quot;Taps&quot; is played at U.S. military schools—such as Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, New Mexico Military Institute, The Citadel, and Virginia Tech—when a member or former member of a school&#x27;s corps of cadets is killed in action. Echo Taps ceremonies involve some arrangement of &quot;Taps&quot; for two buglers, playing antiphonally to represent both the cadet&#x27;s branch of service and their college. Silver Taps ceremonies may use such an arrangement, or some other version for two or more instruments.

At Norwich University, the ceremony is held on the Upper Parade Ground, where the Corps of Cadets forms up silently at 2145 (9:45 p.m.) for tattoo, and then stands in silence until 2200 (10:00 p.m.) when &quot;Echo Taps&quot; is sounded, at which time unit commanders tacitly will give the commands of attention and present arms. The regimental bugler stands either near the flagpole in front of Jackman Hall or on Jackman&#x27;s balcony and plays the main tune of &quot;Taps&quot;. The echoing bugler will stand on the steps of Dewey Hall facing the Parade Ground and echo each series of notes. Following the sounding of &quot;Taps&quot;, the Corps of Cadets dismisses in silence.

At Texas A&amp;M, Echo Taps is held on the Corps of Cadets Quad at 10:30 p.m. For the ceremony, the Corps falls out and both students and cadets gather to form around the Quad. A bugler is posted at the megaphone on the south end and another is at the arches on the north end. Cadets salute and the bugler on the south end plays the first three notes of Silver Taps, the bugler on the north end echoes, the bugler on the south end plays the next three notes and is echoed for the rest of the song. Cadets and students then return to their dorms.

By far, one of Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s most honored traditions is Silver Taps. Silver Taps is the student body&#x27;s final tribute paid to an Aggie who, at the time of their death, was enrolled in undergraduate or graduate studies. This final tribute is held the first Tuesday of the month when a student has died the previous month. The first Silver Taps was held in 1898 and honored Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the former governor of Texas and president of A&amp;M College. Silver Taps is currently held in the Academic Plaza. On the day of Silver Taps, a small card with the deceased student&#x27;s name, class, major, and date of birth is placed as a notice at the base of the academic flagpole, in addition to the memorial located behind the flagpole. The A&amp;M student newspaper, &quot;The Battalion&quot;, dedicates their Tuesday issue on a Silver Taps day to sharing stories of who the deceased students were. Around 10:15 that night, the lights are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower. Students silently gather at the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. At 10:30 p.m., the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad marches into the plaza and fires three rifle volleys totaling 21 shots fired. Six buglers then play a special rendition of Silver Taps by Colonel Richard Dunn (Aggie Band Director, 1924–1946). Taps is played three times from the dome of the Academic Building: once to the North, South, and West. It is not played to the East because the sun will never rise on that Aggie again. After the buglers play, the students silently return to their homes. Students return to their dorms, and lights remain extinguished until Reveille the next morning.

At New Mexico Military Institute, &quot;Echo Taps&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;Silver Taps&quot;) is played by three trumpets on a night designated by the alumni association. This ceremony is held in the Hagerman Barracks to remember all the alumni who had died of normal causes or were killed in action that year. This ceremony also includes the lighting and extinguishing of a candle for every alumni of the year. One bugler is posted at the north, south, and west side of the barracks and the candles at the east. After this early &quot;Taps&quot;, complete silence marks the rest of the night.

Army Regulation 220–90, Army Bands dated December 2007, Paragraph 2-5h(1) states the following: &quot;&#x27;Echo Taps&#x27; or &#x27;Silver Taps&#x27;, the practice of performing &#x27;Taps&#x27; with multiple buglers, is not authorized. &#x27;Echo Taps&#x27; is not a part of Army tradition and improperly uses bugler assets.&quot;

Army Regulation 600–25, Salutes, Honors, and Visits of Courtesy, dated September 2004, Glossary, Section two states the following: &quot;Taps The traditional &#x27;lights out&#x27; musical composition played at military funerals and memorials. The official version of &#x27;Taps&#x27; is played by a single bugle. In accordance with AR 220–90, &#x27;Echo or Silver Taps&#x27;, which is performed by two buglers, is not authorized.&quot;

&quot;Field Manual 12–50, U.S. Army Bands&quot;, dated October 1999, Appendix A, Official and Ceremonial Music, Appendix A, Section 1—Ceremonial Music, Paragraph A-35 &quot;A-35. Signals that unauthorized lights are to be extinguished. This is the last call of the day. The call is also sounded at the completion of a military funeral ceremony. Taps is to be performed by a single bugler only. Performance of &#x27;Silver Taps&#x27; or &#x27;Echo Taps&#x27; is not consistent with Army traditions, and is an improper use of bugler assets.&quot;

=== Scouting ===
Many Scouting, Girl Scouts and Guiding groups around the world sing the first verse of &quot;Taps&quot; (&quot;Day is done ...&quot;) at the close of a camp or campfire. Scouts in encampment may also have the unit&#x27;s bugler sound taps once the rest of the unit has turned in, to signify that the day&#x27;s activities have concluded and that silence is expected in the camp.

Within the Girl Guides of Canada, it is tradition to sing the third verse (&quot;Thanks and praise ...&quot;) if the closing is done during daytime. This is often known as Daylight Taps. 

The song (but in the key of G) was used for closedown on LM Radio in the 1960s before the national anthem.

<text>The Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (simply University of Munich, LMU or LMU Munich; ) is a public research university in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. Originally established as the University of Ingolstadt in 1472 by Duke Ludwig IX of Bavaria-Landshut, it is Germany&#x27;s sixth-oldest university in continuous operation.

In 1800, the university was moved from Ingolstadt to Landshut by King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria when the city was threatened by the French, before being transferred to its present-day location in Munich in 1826 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1802, the university was officially named Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität by King Maximilian I of Bavaria in honor of himself and Ludwig IX.

LMU is currently the second-largest university in Germany in terms of student population; in the 2023/24 winter semester, the university had a total of 52,972 matriculated students. Of these, 10,138 were freshmen, while international students totaled 2,859 or approximately 28% of the student population. As for the operating budget, the university records in 2022 a total of 797.4 million euros in funding without the university hospital; with the university hospital, the university has a total funding amounting to approximately 2.18 billion euros.

 the University of Munich is associated with 44 Nobel laureates. Among these were Wilhelm Röntgen, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn and Thomas Mann. 
Notable alumni, faculty and researchers include Pope Benedict XVI, Rudolf Peierls, Josef Mengele, Richard Strauss, Walter Benjamin, Joseph Campbell, Muhammad Iqbal, Marie Stopes, Wolfgang Pauli, Bertolt Brecht, Max Horkheimer, Karl Loewenstein, Carl Schmitt, Gustav Radbruch, Ernst Cassirer, Ernst Bloch and Konrad Adenauer. LMU has recently been conferred the title of &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under the German Universities Excellence Initiative, and is a member of U15 as well as the LERU.

== History ==

=== 1472–1800 ===

The university was founded with papal approval in 1472 as the University of Ingolstadt (foundation right of Louis IX the Rich), with faculties of philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence and theology. Its first rector was Christopher Mendel of Steinfels, who later became bishop of Chiemsee.

In the period of German humanism, the university&#x27;s academics included names such as Conrad Celtes and Petrus Apianus. The theologian Johann Eck also taught at the university. From 1549 to 1773, the university was influenced by the Jesuits and became one of the centres of the Counter-Reformation. The Jesuit Petrus Canisius served as rector of the university.

At the end of the 18th century, the university was influenced by the Enlightenment, which led to a stronger emphasis on natural science.

=== 1800–1933 ===


In 1800, the Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph (the later Maximilian I, King of Bavaria) moved the university to Landshut, due to French aggression that threatened Ingolstadt during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1802, the university was renamed the Ludwig Maximilian University in honour of its two founders, Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria and Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. The Minister of Education, Maximilian von Montgelas, initiated a number of reforms that sought to modernize the rather conservative and Jesuit-influenced university. In 1826, it was moved to Munich, the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The university was situated in the Old Academy until a new building in the Ludwigstraße was completed. The locals were somewhat critical of the number of Protestant professors Maximilian and later Ludwig I invited to Munich. They were dubbed the &quot;Nordlichter&quot; (northern lights), and especially physician Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis was quite angry about them.

In the second half of the 19th century, the university rose to great prominence in the European scientific community, attracting many of the world&#x27;s leading scientists. It was also a period of great expansion. From 1903, women were allowed to study at Bavarian universities, and by 1918, the female proportion of students at LMU had reached 18%. In 1918, Adele Hartmann became the first woman in Germany to earn the Habilitation (higher doctorate), at LMU.

During the Weimar Republic, the university continued to be one of the world&#x27;s leading universities, with professors such as Wilhelm Röntgen, Wilhelm Wien, Richard Willstätter, Arnold Sommerfeld and Ferdinand Sauerbruch.

=== 1933–1945 ===

During the Third Reich, academic freedom was severely curtailed. In 1943, the White Rose group, consisting of anti-Nazi students, carried out a campaign opposing the National Socialists at this institution. The university subsequently removed Kurt Huber, a Nazi opposition fighter, from his position and revoked his doctorate upon his arrest.

Between 1933 and 1936, Karl Escherich served as rector at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, followed by Leopold Kölbl from 1936 to 1938, Philipp Broemser from 1938 to 1941, and finally, Walther Wüst from 1941 to 1945.

=== 1945–present ===


The university has continued to be one of the leading universities of West Germany during the Cold War and in the post-reunification era. In the late 1960s, the university was the scene of protests by radical students.

Today, the University of Munich is part of 24 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 13 of them. It also hosts 12 DFG Research Training Groups and three international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria, an educational policy concept of Bavaria for the promotion of gifted pupils and students in the higher education sector. It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives.

LMU Munich has a wide range of degree programs, with 150 subjects available in numerous combinations. 15% of the 45,000 students who attend the university come from abroad.

In 2005, Germany&#x27;s state and federal governments launched the German Universities Excellence Initiative, a contest among its universities. With a total of 1.9 billion euros, 75 percent of which comes from the federal state, its architects aim to strategically promote top-level research and scholarship. The money is given to more than 30 research universities in Germany.

The initiative will fund three project-oriented areas: graduate schools to promote the next generation of scholars, clusters of excellence to promote cutting-edge research, and &quot;future concepts&quot; for the project-based expansion of academic excellence at universities as a whole. In order to qualify for this third area, a university had to have at least one internationally recognized academic center of excellence and a new graduate school. After the first round of selections, LMU Munich was invited to submit applications for all three funding lines. It entered the competition with proposals for two graduate schools and four clusters of excellence.

On Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education. The panel, composed of the German Research Foundation and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one graduate school, three &quot;excellence clusters&quot; and general funding for the university&#x27;s &quot;future concept&quot;.

In January 2012, scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University published details of the most sensitive listening device known so far. This has led to the college being inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records.

In September 2018, the Munich public prosecutor&#x27;s office investigated a university vice president on suspicion of embezzlement. The vice president should have claimed &quot;excessive travel expenses&quot;. The following year, veterinary students reported that the LMU violated animal welfare standards. According to them, the LMU keeps pigs in tight grid boxes, so that some animals showed scratches, bumps and respiratory diseases from lying down. Students who reported these circumstances said that they were threatened with deregistration from the university. In the beginning of 2020, the LMU locked around 80 students in a room who wanted to discuss the topic &quot;Climate Burns, University Burns,&quot; about why universities are doing research for companies that are harmful to the climate.

== Campus ==


LMU&#x27;s institutes and research centers are spread throughout Munich, with several buildings located in the suburbs of Oberschleissheim and Garching as well as Maisach and Bad Tölz. The university&#x27;s main buildings are grouped around Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and Professor-Huber-Platz on Ludwigstrasse, extending into side streets such as Akademiestraße, Schellingstraße, and Veterinärstraße. Other large campuses and institutes are located in Großhadern (Klinikum Großhadern), Martinsried (chemistry and biotechnology campus), the Ludwigsvorstadt (Klinikum Innenstadt) and in the Lehel (Institut am Englischen Garten), across from the main buildings, through the Englischer Garten.

The university&#x27;s main building is situated in Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and the university&#x27;s main campus is served by the Munich subway&#x27;s Universität station.

=== Great Assembly Hall (Große Aula) ===

The große Aula is located in the university main building at Ludwigstraße in Munich. The Aula was constructed as part of the main building by Friedrich von Gärtner and completed in 1840. The hall is situated in the first floor and extends to the second floor.

The Aula was not destroyed during World War II and, thus, is one of few usable pre war venues in Munich. The Aula was used for the first performances of concerts after the war. Furthermore, it was venue for the constituent assembly of the state of Bavaria, where the current Bavarian constitution was enacted.

Today, the Aula hosts mainly concerts, talks and lectures.

== Academics ==

=== Fields of study ===
Despite the Bologna Process which saw the demise of most traditional academic-degree courses such as the &quot;Diplom&quot; and &quot;Magister Artium&quot; in favour of the more internationally known Bachelors and Masters system, the University of Munich continues to offer more than 100 areas of study with numerous combinations of majors and minors.

In line with the university&#x27;s internationalisation as a popular destination for tertiary studies, an increasing number of courses mainly at the graduate and post-graduate levels are also available in English to cater to international students who may have little or no background in the German language. Some notable subject areas which currently offer programmes in English include various fields of psychology, physics as well as business and management.

=== Faculties ===
The university consists of 18 faculties which oversee various departments and institutes. The official numbering of the faculties and the missing numbers 06 and 14 are the result of breakups and mergers of faculties in the past. The Faculty of Forestry Operations with number 06 has been integrated into the Technical University of Munich in 1999 and faculty number 14 has been merged with faculty number 13.
* 01 Faculty of Catholic Theology
* 02 Faculty of Protestant Theology
* 03 Faculty of Law
* 04 Faculty of Business Administration
* 05 Faculty of Economics
* 07 Faculty of Medicine
* 08 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine
* 09 Faculty for History and the Arts
* 10 Faculty of Philosophy, Philosophy of Science and Study of Religion
* 11 Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences

* 16 Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics
* 17 Faculty of Physics
* 18 Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy
* 19 Faculty of Biology
* 20 Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Sciences

=== Research centres ===

In addition to its 18 faculties, the University of Munich also maintains numerous research centres involved in numerous cross-faculty and transdisciplinary projects to complement its various academic programmes. Some of these research centres were a result of cooperation between the university and renowned external partners from academia and industry; the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, for example, was established through a joint initiative between LMU Munich and the Deutsches Museum, while the Parmenides Center for the Study of Thinking resulted from the collaboration between the Parmenides Foundation and LMU Munich&#x27;s Human Science Center.

Some of the research centres which have been established include:
* Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM)
* Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences (GSN)
* Helmholtz Zentrum München – German Research Center for Environmental Health
* Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM)
* Parmenides Center for the Study of Thinking
* Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society

=== Tuition and fees ===

Universities in Bavaria do not charge tuition fees. Instead, a mandatory semester fee has to be paid that is fully transferred to the student union for providing, amongst other services, housing and lunch options for students.

=== Rankings ===

=== &quot;One Munich Strategy Forum&quot; ===

The LMU and the Technical University of Munich have come together to work on &quot;One Munich Strategy Forum&quot;, with a €2.5 million fund from the state of Bavaria.

=== Munich International Summer University ===
The Munich International Summer University (MISU at LMU) is the Summer University by LMU, which takes place annually in Munich and depending on the course also involves stays at different European cities. MISU invites international students to attend short-term programs at the LMU Munich in order to progress academically even in winter or summer breaks at their home university. MISU hereby offers two course formats: On the one hand German Language classes are held at different times over the year. On the other hand, MISU offers 16 subject-specific Summer Schools and Winter Schools covering a wide range of academic fields. Around 1000 students from nearly 90 countries joined MISU short-term programs in 2019.

Germany has a long tradition of hosting summer programs for international students. The LMU Munich organised its Summer University for the first time in 1927. Labelled as &quot;Sommerkurse für Ausländer&quot; (&quot;Summer Courses for Foreigners&quot;) the Summer University ran annually until 1934 and primarily consisted of German Language courses for international students. After a longer intermittence period, LMU&#x27;s Summer University resumed as &quot;Internationaler Münchner Sommer&quot; (&quot;International Summer in Munich&quot;). Since then the number of courses has increased and the range of subject-specific Summer Schools was extended to further academic disciplines. From 2008 onwards LMU&#x27;s Summer University operates under the name Munich International Summer University (MISU).

A central aim of MISU is to boost the internationality of the LMU Munich in terms of research and teaching. Compared to semester-based student exchange programs, short-term programs such as Summer Schools have the advantage for international students to receive a very intensive and concise insight into the research areas and campus at the LMU Munich. MISU hereby has the objective to combine excellent academic education with extra-curricular activities. Participants are thus not only supervised intensively by established researchers on selected topics but are also introduced to the history, culture and politics of Munich, Bavaria and Germany. Moreover, the Summer University allows the LMU Munich to intensify cooperation with international partner universities. MISU&#x27;s short-term programs therefore strengthen the LMU&#x27;s international visibility as one of the highest ranked universities in Europe.

== Notable alumni and faculty members ==
The alumni of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich played a major role in the development of quantum mechanics. Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory and Nobel laureate in Physics in 1918, was an alumnus of the university. Founders of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, and others were associated with the university.
Most recently, to honor the Nobel laureate in Chemistry Gerhard Ertl, who worked as a professor at the University of Munich from 1973 to 1986, the building of the Physical Chemistry was named after him.

Pakistani philosopher and poet Sir Muhammad Iqbal, regarded as the &quot;Poet of the East&quot; and &quot;The Thinker of Pakistan&quot;, earned his PhD degree from the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich in 1908. Working under the guidance of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal published his doctoral thesis in 1908, entitled &quot;The Development of Metaphysics in Persia&quot;.

The anti-Nazi resistance White Rose was based in this university.

<text>Lappeenranta (; ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of South Karelia. It is located in the southeastern interior of the country and in the Finnish Lakeland. The population of Lappeenranta is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 11th most populous urban area in the country.

Lappeenranta is located on the shore of Lake Saimaa, from the Russian border and from the city of Vyborg. Lappeenranta is one of the most important urban centres in the entire Saimaa region, together with the cities of Imatra, Mikkeli and Savonlinna. Lappeenranta incorporated the late municipalities of Lappee and Lauritsala in 1967, Nuijamaa in 1989, Joutseno in 2009 and Ylämaa in 2010.

Lappeenranta, the region&#x27;s tourism centre, is the second most visited city in Finland by Russian tourists after Helsinki and competes with Helsinki for the largest share of tax-free sales in Finland. Lappeenranta is a model for renewable energy and a clean living environment. Lappeenranta was the only Finnish city among the 14 finalists of the international Earth Hour City Challenge 2014 organised by WWF. In 2009, Lappeenranta was ranked fourth in the comparison of the largest Finnish cities, while in the 2008 survey the city was ranked fifth. In a survey conducted among business representatives in 2011, Lappeenranta was ranked 17th among Finnish cities in terms of image.

Lappeenranta Airport, opened in 1918 and located in the city centre, is Finland&#x27;s oldest operating airport.

== History ==
The village of Kauskila, located about eight kilometers to the south of downtown Lappeenranta, was among the most significant Karelian population centers in South Karelia during the Middle Ages. Kauskila has been continuously inhabited for approximately 2,000 years.

Lappeenranta&#x27;s original core settlement, Lapvesi, later Lappee, was originally formed around a headland jutting into Lake Saimaa, the site of the present fortress. The public market was established here, which became so important as a trading place that general Governor Count Per Brahe the Younger proposed that the Swedish government should grant town privileges to Lapvesi. The town was chartered in 1649 by Queen Christina of Sweden. At the time, Lapvesi was an important port for tar.

Between 1721 and 1743, Lappeenranta was the capital of Kymmenegård and Nyslott County and during this period the Swedes built the fortress out in stages.

In 1741, the Battle of Villmanstrand was fought between the Swedish and Russian armies in the Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743. The battle ended in a Russian victory. The town was pillaged, wooden structures including the provincial chancellery were burnt and the ecclesiastical archives damaged. The remaining portion of Old Finland still belonging to Sweden, including Lappeenranta, was ceded by Sweden to Russia per the Treaty of Turku. Following the creation of the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809, Old Finland was joined to the Grand Duchy in 1812 as a gesture of goodwill by Alexander I of Russia.

Lappeenranta incorporated the neighbouring municipalities of Lappee and Lauritsala on 1 January 1967, Nuijamaa on 1 January 1989, Joutseno on 1 January 2009, and Ylämaa on 1 January 2010.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Lappeenranta&quot; consists of the genitive of &quot;Lappee&quot; (the name of the original core town) and the common noun &quot;ranta&quot; which means &quot;shore&quot;. The history of Lappeenranta includes the rural municipality of Lappee and the hundred Lapvesi. The Swedish name &quot;Villmanstrand&quot; contains the words &quot;vildman&quot; meaning &quot;wild man&quot; and &quot;strand&quot; also meaning &quot;shore&quot;. A wild man is depicted on Lappeenranta&#x27;s coat of arms.

==Geography==

Located on the southern shore of Lake Saimaa, Lappeenranta&#x27;s neighboring municipalities on the Finnish side are Imatra, Lemi, Luumäki, Miehikkälä, Ruokolahti and Taipalsaari, and on the Russian side, neighbors include Svetogorsk and Kamennogorsk.

=== Climate ===
Lappeenranta has a humid continental climate of the warm-summer type (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). The summers are longer, although rarely hot, and usually warm. Some of the warmest summers in the country can be found here, due to its orientation: southern but inland. Being in an eastern part of Finland, the winters are often harsh but still mild compared to areas further east.

Anchorage has some similarities by being of marine influence of hot currents and at the same time of the marginal continentality. But Lappeenranta is still able to receive heat waves that cross Central Europe in a warmer climate than cool.

==== Climate changes ==== 
Between 2000 and 2017 the temperature change was greater than the whole previous century, with +1.2 °C (higher values than Helsinki or Oulu). Since 2000 the number of warm days (&gt; 24 °C) has become 2 per year, while the 1900 data indicates only 2 days per decade. From the first half of the twentieth century the days above 24 °C changed from rare to occasional in the second half to regular in the present century. There was also a 17.5 decrease in temperature below −1 °C for the same comparison period. 2015 was the hottest year since 1900, having one of the less than 50 days with freezing days. Work to reduce the temperature increase has been carried out; the city is again among the best 45 cities in the world in the WWF City Challenge 2016. One of the goals is to reduce carbon dioxide by 30% by 2020 and zero emissions by 2050. According to the 1961-1990 climate norms, the climate of Lappeenranta was a climate of continental subarctic zone (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) closely bordering on the humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). Compared to decades ago, the total amount of precipitation has also increased somewhat.

The eponymous GoSaimaa (www.gosaimaa.com) provides all the touristic activities in the area. In addition, its inland location means that summers tend to be warmer and winters colder than along the coastal areas.

Lappeenranta has a healthy winter tourism industry. Various cabins around Lake Saimaa, as well as numerous snowmobiles, Nordic skating, floating in the river, reindeer rides, paragliding, skiing and sledding tracks draw a fair number of winter visitors. The proximity of the Russian border is increasingly evident in the number of Russian tourists visiting the city. In fact, Lappeenranta is closer to Saint Petersburg () than it is to Helsinki, the capital of Finland (). The presence of Russian tourists is noticeable by the many Russian registered cars on the streets and the use of Cyrillic letters in signs of some shops.

<text>Herminie Cadolle (1845–1926) was a French inventor of the modern bra and founder of the Cadolle Lingerie House. 

== Early life ==
Herminie Cadolle was born, raised, and lived much of her early life in France. She was a close friend of the insurrectionist Louise Michel, who participated in the Paris Commune of 1871. Fearing state repression after the murderous defeat of the Commune uprising, Cadolle and her family fled for safety to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

== Career ==
In 1887, while she was in Argentina, it marked the start of her entrepreneurial journey. Supported by her husband and son, Alcide, she opened the first &quot;House of Cadolle,&quot; quickly building a fortune through her made-to-measure lingerie business. In 1889, Cadolle returned to Paris where she opened a similar lingerie workshop. There, she invented a two-piece undergarment. The lower part was a hybrid-corset for the waist and the upper supported the breasts by means of shoulder straps. A patent for the invention was filed in 1889. The invention, called the &quot;corselet-gorge,&quot; was revolutionary, as it literally split the traditional corset in two to provide more comfort. Early sketches show it was initially attached to the corset, but even that small change helped pave the way for bras as we know them. Cadolle exhibited her invention at the Exposition Universelle (1900) and by 1905 the upper half was being sold separately as modern-day bras.

Corsets had been briefly unpopular during the French Revolution of 1789, when they were associated with the aristocracy, but soon they returned to prominence as the political mood settled again. From the middle of the 19th century, gradually, the corset came under more and more criticism. Advocates for women’s rights, like Cadolle, and physicians highlighted its role in causing physical discomfort and health complications. Despite her innovation, the bra struggled to gain popularity at first. The fashion of the late 19th century still favored tiny waists, which required full corsets. It wasn’t until World War I, when women entered factories and prioritized practicality over aesthetics, that the bra became widely accepted. Cadolle continued to work into the 1920s. Her efforts were spurred by the First World War, which saw women enter the factories when male workers left for war. Comfort rather than beauty was crucial, so the corset was out and the bra was in. Cadolle’s innovation and different variations of it are still dominant in female undergarments, as is the desire for women’s rights and the rebellion against adherence to societal norms and the ideal image of a woman’s body.

Cadolle became a fitter of bras to queens, princesses, dancers, and actresses. Mata Hari was among her customers. Her work also served as a foundation for collaborations with haute couture houses. 

== Legacy ==
By 1911, Cadolle’s daughter Marie moved the business to Rue Cambon, where the shop shared proximity with luxury brands like Chanel and Hermès. This established Cadolle as a cornerstone of Parisian fashion. She was also the first to use cloth incorporating rubber (elastic) thread. Cadolle’s business is still run by her descendants today.

<text>The Singapore Area Licensing Scheme (ALS) () was a road pricing scheme introduced in Singapore from 1975 to 1998 that charged drivers who were entering downtown Singapore. This was the first urban traffic congestion pricing scheme to be successfully implemented in the world. This scheme affected all roads entering a 6-square-kilometre area in the Central Business District (CBD) called the &quot;Restricted Zone&quot; (RZ), later increased to 7.25 square kilometres to include areas that later became commercial in nature. The scheme was later replaced in 1998 by the Electronic Road Pricing.

==Background==

The introduction of congestion pricing was one of a number of anti-congestion policies implemented in Singapore since the 1970s, in recognition of the country&#x27;s land constraints, need of economic competitiveness, and to avoid the traffic gridlock that chokes many cities in the world. One key aspect of demand management in Singapore is the restraint of vehicle ownership, either through the imposition of high ownership costs or restriction on the actual growth of the car population. These measures have included high annual road tax, custom duties and vehicle registration fees. Besides fiscal deterrents, supply of motor vehicles was regulated since 1990, when a Vehicle Quota System was introduced. These high initial buy-in charges are considered as the price motorists pay for the luxury of owning a car and to cover part of the fixed costs associated with scaling basic road infrastructure. Then, use-related charges, such as fuel taxes (50% of final sale price), ALS or high parking rates are utilised by public authorities to further constraint travel. In parallel to the whole spectrum of road pricing measures, the government has invested heavily in public transport and implemented a park-and-ride scheme, with thirteen fringe car parks, hence providing car users a real alternative to switch travel modes. In summary, Singapore&#x27;s urban and transport strategy allowed the users to have pro-transit &quot;carrots&quot; matching auto-restraint &quot;sticks&quot;, and as a result, despite having one of the highest per capita incomes in Asia, 32% of Singaporean households owned cars in 2010.

The ALS was first formulated and designed in 1973, under the leadership of a high level inter-ministerial committee, which recommended policies and measures to improve the urban transport situation back then. The ALS scheme was implemented only after a one-year public dialogue and some modifications were made based on the public&#x27;s feedback. As detailed above, the ALS was sold as part of an overall package of road pricing measures and public transportation improvements that helped to gain public support.

==Scheme==
A total of 28 overhead gantries were set up along the boundaries of the RZ, including the areas surrounding Orchard Road. These gantries were monitored by auxiliary police officers who carried out visual checks and recorded any violations. Fines started at S$50. Users had to buy, in advance, a special paper licence at a cost of S$3 per day, which was sold at post offices, petrol stations, area licence sales booths or convenience stores, on a monthly or daily basis. This licence was displayed on the car windscreen or on the handle bars for motorcycles during hours of operation. Initially, they were 7.30 am to 9.30 am daily, except on Sundays and public holidays. However, it soon had to be extended to 10.15 am, to control the surge of vehicles waiting to enter just after 9.30 am. In 1989, the evening peak had to be restricted too, and in 1994, the ALS was extended from 7.30 am to 6.30 pm.

In the first few years after the introduction of the ALS, passenger cars having four or more occupants, taxis, public buses and service vehicles were allowed into the zone without being charged. Carpool was exempted too, to better manage demand and to counter the belief that the scheme favoured the rich. Special carpool pick-up points were set up. In 1989 more users were required to pay the fee, as motorcycles and heavy vehicles made up about two-thirds of the traffic entering the RZ. Hence, with this review of the policy, only buses and emergency vehicles were exempted. Later, the exemption for carpools was abolished, because many private cars were picking up bus commuters just to avoid the payment.

In 1980, the fee was increased to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, due to the fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of licence fees were established, to differentiate between daily permits and inter-peak licences. The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would receive an order to appear in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.

ALS gantries were enforced by CISCO officers, who manually screened passing vehicles and book offending vehicles with fines. Prior to the end of the ALS and the beginning of Electronic Road Pricing (which rendered manual checks obsolete), 105 such officers were deployed.

==Impact==
According to the book &quot;The Journey – Singapore&#x27;s Land Transport Story&quot;, the amount of traffic entering the Restricted Zone in June 1975 (before the ALS was introduced) was 32,500 vehicles, and after the beginning of the ALS in June 1975, the vehicle numbers dropped to only 7,700, between the hours of 7.30 am to 9.30 am, a 76% reduction; and 9% of the users switched to transit. The use of transit for work related trips into the RZ &quot;sharply increased from 33% before the ALS to about 70% by 1983&quot;.
In 1994 ALS was extended to a full day, resulting in an immediate 9.3% drop in traffic in and out the RZ.

The ALS, despite its simplicity, succeeded in effectively restraining congestion in the RZ for more than 20 years. Before the implementation of ALS and the other complementary measures, the motor vehicle fleet was growing at an annual rate of 6%, and in 1975 the traffic volume entering the RZ was about 100,000 vehicles. After the government intervention, the fleet slowed down to a moderate 4% rate of growth, and traffic entering the RZ was limited to only 230,000 vehicles in 1994.

==Road Pricing Scheme (RPS) extended ==
In 1995, congestion pricing was also implemented in urban segments of three major expressways, starting with the East Coast Parkway (ECP). The RPS, as it was called, also operated manually with paper licences to enter the expressways. In 1997, the RPS was implemented in the Central Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway. After the implementation of RPS, the Central Expressway Average speed at peak hour went to 67 km/h from the previous average of 31 km/h. This extension was necessary because some through traffic was diverted by the ALS to routes that bypassed the RZ, increasing demand on these arterials and creating a need for expanding the capacity of the road network outside the RZ. Because of heavier demand, only the Central Expressway required a separate licence, not valid for the RZ. During this time, a more modern system was being planned, to charge every time a user entered the RZ, and thus, charges would reflect the true cost of driving at congested times.

==Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)==
Overall, the ALS was successful in ensuring smooth traffic flow in the Central Business District. After about 10 years of planning and testing, in September 1998, the Area Licensing Scheme was terminated as Singapore upgraded to the current Electronic Road Pricing system, which is completely automatic and allows passing the control gantries at normal speeds. The ERP system is still in use in Singapore, and many similar schemes were based on it, such as the London congestion charge.

<text>Trondheim Toll Scheme or Trondheim Package () was the result of that in the 1980s politicians and road authorities in Trondheim Municipality, Norway wanted to accelerate the investments in roads and motorways around the city through an investment package and toll scheme to ease construction and generate more funds. Between 1991 and 2005, there were more than 20 toll plazas throughout the city that help finance the new roads. Toll plazas will still remain east of the city at least until 2012.

The toll collection is administrated by Trøndelag Veifinans.

==Project size==
The system financed by the scheme includes a ring road around the city on European route E6, a new motorway east of the city to Stjørdal Municipality and Trondheim Airport, Værnes on E6, upgrades to E6 south of the city, including a new intersection at Sandmoen, a new Kroppan Bridge and a four-lane motorway between Klett and Melhus. a road from Ila via Brattøra to Lademoen, named Nordre Avlastningsvei, is under construction with plans to be finished in 2009 while an extension of E6 between the airport and to Kvithamar north of Stjørdal is in the start phase. Projects still not started include putting Osloveien in Byåsen in a tunnel, a new Sluppen Bridge and a four-lane motorway between Tonstad to Klett. There was also a political consensus that some of the money generated by the system should be used to improve public transport in the city. Some environmental projects in the area also benefit from the toll income. 

More than twenty toll booths were built, closing off all approaches to the city. It was impossible for anybody driving a car to get in for free weekdays between 6am and 6pm. The charge was NOK 15 for cars and 30 for trucks. The systems has been designed to be user friendly through AutoPASS technology developed by the local company Q-Free, involving a radio-transmitted registration of passing cars, allowing cars to pass the toll booths at 60 km/h (but at most toll booths the speed limit was 50 km/h). The driver fits a small, plastic RFID device to the windscreen of the car, which communicates with the toll booth when the car passes through, and deducts money from the user&#x27;s account. Those who (intentionally or by negligence) passes a toll booth without an operating toll device (or paying manually where possible) are subject to a fine. Motorists using a toll device are eligible to a toll discount.

The toll ring was not juridically considered a road pricing scheme, since the income from the tolls goes to road infrastructure. To be considered a road pricing in accordance to Norwegian law, the scheme must be organised such as to charge most when the congestion is largest, i.e. in rush hour. Secondly, a road pricing scheme cannot primarily finance road investments, but must go either to public transport subsidies or to infrastructure for public transport and pedestrians and bicycles.

The system was initially introduced to fund the building of new ring roads so that the heaviest traffic would not have to pass through the city centre. Part of the reason for this traffic is due to Trondheim Port being located on an artificial island only accessible via the city centre and Trondheim has yet to move its port out of the city centre, like the London Docklands and Fjordbyen in Oslo. There are ongoing discussions on whether the port should be moved from its current location. The lack of a bypass outside the residential areas, along with less than optimal railroad capacity, contributes heavily to road congestion through Trondheim Municipality.

==Criticism==
The initial reaction to the toll system in Trondheim was mixed. Some daily commuters felt the extra cost was unjustifiable, but most drivers were quite happy to pay in order to get some of the heaviest traffic out of the city centre. Ten years on, most drivers in and around Trondheim do not give the toll system a second thought. They have become used to it over time, and the system was also cleverly designed to be extremely user-friendly . 

The initial development of the project came at the same time as the munnicipal council of Trondheim Municipality decided to close the Trondheim Tramway in 1988, with arguments that diesel buses are cheaper to operate. Trondheim has a notoriously low public transport ridership, at 11% of the total transport trips using public transport, compared to almost 50% in Oslo. Part of this is credited the low frequency and high time costs of using public transport in Trondheim, partially due to high investments in road infrastructure compared to public transport infrastructure.

After the toll ring was closed in 2005 some politicians, environmental advocates and others have suggested reintroducing the toll ring. While some are wanting to use the funds to complete the Trondheim Package, others are wanting to use it to reduce traffic congestion and use the funds for public transport subsidies.

<doc id="252760" wikidata="Q351547" url="?curid=252760" title="Bernard Malamud">
<text>Bernard Malamud (April 26, 1914 – March 18, 1986) was an American novelist and short story writer. Along with Saul Bellow, Joseph Heller, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Norman Mailer and Philip Roth, he was one of the best known American Jewish authors of the 20th century. His baseball novel, &quot;The Natural&quot;, was adapted into a 1984 film starring Robert Redford. His 1966 novel &quot;The Fixer&quot; (also filmed), about antisemitism in the Russian Empire, won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

== Biography ==
Bernard Malamud was born on April 26, 1914, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Bertha (née Fidelman) and Max Malamud, Russian Jewish immigrants who owned and operated a succession of grocery stores in the Williamsburg, Borough Park and Flatbush sections of the borough, culminating in the 1924 opening of a German-style delicatessen (specializing in &quot;cheap canned goods, bread, vegetables, some cheese and cooked meats&quot;) at 1111 McDonald Avenue on the western fringe of Flatbush. (Then known as Gravesend Avenue, the thoroughfare received its current moniker in 1934, while the surrounding community—abutting the elevated BMT Culver Line and characterized as a &quot;very poor&quot; subsection of the neighborhood in a contemporaneous demographic survey of Brooklyn College students—is now considered to be part of the Kensington section.) A brother, Eugene, born in 1917, suffered from mental illness, lived a hard and lonely life and died in his fifties. Bertha Malamud was &quot;emotionally unstable&quot; and attempted suicide by swallowing disinfectant in 1927; although her elder son discovered her in time, she died in a mental hospital two years later.

Malamud entered adolescence at the start of the Great Depression, graduating from central Flatbush&#x27;s storied Erasmus Hall High School in 1932. During his youth, he saw many films and enjoyed relating their plots to his school friends. He was especially fond of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s comedies. He received his BA degree from the City College of New York in 1936. Thereafter, Malamud worked for a year at $4.50 a day () as a student teacher; however, he twice failed an examination that would enable him to become a permanent substitute teacher in the New York City public school system. Momentarily funded by a government loan, he completed the coursework for a master&#x27;s degree in English at Columbia University in 1937-38; although he felt it was &quot;close to a waste of time&quot;, he eventually received the degree after submitting a thesis on Thomas Hardy in 1942. From 1939-40, he was a temporary substitute teacher at Lafayette High School in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn. He was excused from World War II-era military service because he was the sole support of his father, who had remarried to Liza Merov in 1932. While working in a temporary capacity for the Bureau of the Census in Washington D.C., he contributed sketches to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, marking some of his first published works. Returning to New York after the job ended, he taught English at Erasmus Hall (in its adult-oriented evening session) for nine years while focusing on writing during the day. Toward the end of this period, he also worked at the similarly oriented Chelsea Vocational High School (where he taught in the day program to supplement his income) and Harlem Evening High School.

Starting in 1949, Malamud taught four sections of freshman composition each semester at Oregon State University, an experience fictionalized in his 1961 novel &quot;A New Life&quot;. Because he lacked a PhD, he was not allowed to teach literature courses, and for a number of years, his rank was that of instructor; nevertheless, he was promoted to assistant professor in 1954 and became a tenured associate professor in 1958. While at OSU, Malamud devoted three days out of every week to his writing, and gradually emerged as a major American author. In 1961, he left OSU to teach creative writing at Bennington College, a position he held until retirement. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967.

In 1942, Malamud met Ann De Chiara (November 1, 1917 – March 20, 2007), an Italian American Roman Catholic, and a 1939 Cornell University graduate. Despite the opposition of their parents (prompting their relocation from Brooklyn to Greenwich Village), they married on November 6, 1945. Ann typed his manuscripts and reviewed his writing. They had two children, Paul (b. 1947) and Janna (b. 1952). Janna is the author of a memoir about her father, titled &quot;My Father Is A Book&quot;.

Malamud was Jewish, an agnostic, and a humanist. He died in Manhattan (where he had maintained a winter residence at the Upper West Side&#x27;s Lincoln Towers since 1972) on March 18, 1986, at the age of 71. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In his writing, Malamud depicts an honest picture of the despair and difficulties of the immigrants to America, and their hope of reaching their dreams despite their poverty.

==Writing career==
Malamud wrote slowly and carefully; he is the author of eight novels and four collections of short stories. The posthumously published &quot;Complete Stories&quot; contains 55 short stories and is 629 pages long. Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent in 1942 and 1945.

He completed his first novel, &quot;The Light Sleeper&quot;, in 1948, but later burned the manuscript. His first published novel was &quot;The Natural&quot; (1952), which has become one of his best remembered and most symbolic works. The story traces the life of Roy Hobbs, an unknown middle-aged baseball player who achieves legendary status with his stellar talent. This novel was made into a 1984 movie starring Robert Redford.

Malamud&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Assistant&quot; (1957), set in New York and drawing on Malamud&#x27;s own childhood, is an account of the life of Morris Bober, a Jewish immigrant who owns a grocery store in Brooklyn. Although he is struggling financially, Bober takes in a drifter of dubious character. This novel was quickly followed by &quot;The Magic Barrel,&quot; his first published collection of short stories (1958). It won Malamud the first of two National Book Awards that he received in his lifetime.

In 1967, his novel &quot;The Fixer&quot;, about antisemitism in the Russian Empire, became one of the few books to receive the National Book Award for Fiction and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His other novels include &quot;Dubin&#x27;s Lives&quot;, a powerful evocation of middle age (largely inspired by Malamud&#x27;s own extramarital affairs) that employs biography to recreate the narrative richness of its protagonists&#x27; lives, and &quot;The Tenants&quot;, perhaps a meta-narrative on Malamud&#x27;s own writing and creative struggles, which, set in New York City, deals with racial issues and the emergence of black/African American literature in the American 1970s landscape.

Malamud was renowned for his short stories, often oblique allegories set in a dreamlike urban ghetto of immigrant Jews. Of Malamud, Flannery O&#x27;Connor wrote: &quot;I have discovered a short-story writer who is better than any of them, including myself.&quot; He published his first stories in 1943, &quot;Benefit Performance&quot; in &quot;Threshold&quot; and &quot;The Place Is Different Now&quot; in &quot;American Preface&quot;. Shortly after joining the faculty of Oregon State University, his stories began appearing in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, and &quot;Commentary&quot;.

==Themes==
Writing in the second half of the twentieth century, Malamud was well aware of the social problems of his day: rootlessness, infidelity, abuse, divorce, and more. But he also depicted love as redemptive and sacrifice as uplifting. In his writings, success often depends on cooperation between antagonists. For example, in &quot;The Mourners&quot; landlord and tenant learn from each other&#x27;s anguish. In &quot;The Magic Barrel&quot;, the matchmaker worries about his &quot;fallen&quot; daughter, while the daughter and the rabbinic student are drawn together by their need for love and salvation.

==Posthumous tributes==

Philip Roth: &quot;A man of stern morality&quot;, Malamud was driven by &quot;the need to consider long and seriously every last demand of an overtaxed, overtaxing conscience torturously exacerbated by the pathos of human need unabated&quot;.

Saul Bellow, also quoting Anthony Burgess: &quot;Well, we were here, first-generation Americans, our language was English and a language is a spiritual mansion from which no one can evict us. Malamud in his novels and stories discovered a sort of communicative genius in the impoverished, harsh jargon of immigrant New York. He was a myth maker, a fabulist, a writer of exquisite parables. The English novelist Anthony Burgess said of him that he &#x27;never forgets that he is an American Jew, and he is at his best when posing the situation of a Jew in urban American society.&#x27; &#x27;A remarkably consistent writer,&#x27; he goes on, &#x27;who has never produced a mediocre novel ... He is devoid of either conventional piety or sentimentality ... always profoundly convincing.&#x27; Let me add on my own behalf that the accent of hard-won and individual emotional truth is always heard in Malamud&#x27;s words. He is a rich original of the first rank.&quot;
[Saul Bellow&#x27;s eulogy to Malamud, 1986]

===Centenary===

There were numerous tributes and celebrations marking the centenary of Malamud&#x27;s birth (April 26, 1914). To commemorate the centenary, Malamud&#x27;s current publisher (who still keeps most of Malamud&#x27;s work in print) published on-line (through their blog) some of the &quot;Introductions&quot; to these works. Oregon State University announced that they would be celebrating the 100th birthday &quot;of one of its most-recognized faculty members&quot; (Malamud taught there from 1949 to 1961).

Media outlets also joined in the celebration. Throughout March, April, and May 2014 there were many Malamud stories and articles on blogs, in newspapers (both print and on-line), and on the radio. Many of these outlets featured reviews of Malamud&#x27;s novels and stories, editions of which have recently been issued by the Library of America. There were also many tributes and appreciations from fellow writers and surviving family members. Some of the more prominent of these kinds of tributes included those from Malamud&#x27;s daughter, from Malamud&#x27;s biographer Philip Davis, and from fellow novelist and short story writer Cynthia Ozick. Other prominent writers who gathered for readings and tributes included Tobias Wolff, Edward P. Jones, and Lorrie Moore.

<doc id="252762" wikidata="Q276189" url="?curid=252762" title="Mediterranean gull">
<text>The Mediterranean gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus) is a small gull. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus &quot;Ichthyaetus&quot; is from &quot;ikhthus&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;, and the specific &quot;melanocephalus&quot; is from &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;-kephalos&quot; &quot;-headed&quot;.

This gull breeds almost entirely in the Western Palearctic, mainly in the south east, especially around the Black Sea, and in central Turkey. There are colonies elsewhere in southern Europe, and this species has undergone a dramatic range expansion in recent decades. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;.

==Description==
The Mediterranean gull is slightly larger and bulkier than the black-headed gull with a heavier bill and longer, darker legs. The breeding plumage adult is a distinctive white gull, with a very pale grey mantle and wings with white primary feathers without black tips. The black hood extends down the nape and shows distinct white eye crescents. The sharp-tipped, parallel sided, dark red bill has a black subterminal band. The non breeding adult is similar but the hood is reduced to an extensive dusky &quot;bandit&quot; mask through the eye. This bird takes two years to reach maturity. First year birds have a black terminal tail band and more black areas in the upperwings, but have pale underwings.

==Distribution==
Formerly restricted to the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean this species has now expanded over most of Europe as far as Great Britain and Ireland, with 37 sites: 543–592 pairs in the United Kingdom in 2008, breeding in Scotland for the first time in 2023. In Ireland breeding has been recorded in at least four counties. Breeding has also occurred in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Balkans.

In winter, this bird migrates to Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts.

==Ecology==

This gull breeds in colonies in large reed beds or marshes, or on islands in lakes; where its population is small, it nests in black-headed gull colonies. Like most gulls, it is highly gregarious in winter, both when feeding or in evening roosts. It is not a pelagic species, and is rarely seen at sea far from coasts.

The Mediterranean gull&#x27;s feeding habits are much an opportunistic omnivore, eating fish, worms, insects, eggs, young birds, offal and carrion.

This is a noisy species, especially at colonies, with a nasal &quot;yeah&quot; call.

==Conservation==
The Mediterranean gull is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) is a method for creating, maintaining, and manipulating computer files of data so that records can be retrieved sequentially or randomly by one or more keys. Indexes of key fields are maintained to achieve fast retrieval of required file records in indexed files. IBM originally developed ISAM for mainframe computers, but implementations are available for most computer systems.

The term &quot;ISAM&quot; is used for several related concepts:
*The IBM ISAM product and the algorithm it employs.
*A database system where an application developer directly uses an application programming interface to search indexes in order to locate records in data files. In contrast, a relational database uses a query optimizer which automatically selects indexes.
*An indexing algorithm that allows both sequential and keyed access to data. Most databases use some variation of the B-tree for this purpose, although the original IBM ISAM and VSAM implementations did not do so.
*Most generally, any index for a database. Indexes are used by almost all databases.

==Organization==
In an ISAM system, data is organized into records which are composed of fixed length fields, originally stored sequentially in key sequence. Secondary set(s) of records, known as &quot;indexes&quot;, contain pointers to the location of each record, allowing individual records to be retrieved without having to search the entire data set. This differs from the contemporaneous navigational databases, in which the pointers to other records were stored inside the records themselves. The key improvement in ISAM is that the indexes are small and can be searched quickly, possibly entirely in memory, thereby allowing the database to access only the records it needs. Additional modifications to the data do not require changes to other data, only the table and indexes in question.

When an ISAM file is created, index nodes are fixed, and their pointers do not change during inserts and deletes that occur later (only content of leaf nodes change afterwards). As a consequence of this, if inserts to some leaf node exceed the node&#x27;s capacity, new records are stored in overflow chains. If there are many more inserts than deletions from a table, these overflow chains can gradually become very large, and this affects the time required for retrieval of a record.

Relational databases can easily be built on an ISAM framework with the addition of logic to maintain the validity of the links between the tables. Typically the field being used as the link, the &quot;foreign key&quot;, will be indexed for quick lookup. While this is slower than simply storing the pointer to the related data directly in the records, it also means that changes to the physical layout of the data do not require any updating of the pointers—the entry will still be valid.

ISAM is simple to understand and implement, as it primarily consists of direct access to a database file. The trade-off is that each client machine must manage its own connection to each file it accesses. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of conflicting inserts into those files, leading to an inconsistent database state. To prevent this, some ISAM implementations provide whole-file or individual record locking functionality. Locking multiple records runs the risk of deadlock unless a deadlock prevention scheme is strictly followed. The problems of locking, and deadlock are typically solved with the addition of a client–server framework which marshals client requests and maintains ordering. Full ACID transaction management systems are provided by some ISAM client–server implementations. These are the basic concepts behind a database management system (DBMS), which is a client layer over the underlying data store.

ISAM was replaced at IBM with a methodology called VSAM (virtual storage access method). Still later, IBM developed SQL/DS and then Db2 which IBM promotes as their primary database management system. VSAM is the physical access method used in Db2.

==OpenVMS==
The OpenVMS operating system uses the Files-11 file system in conjunction with RMS (Record Management Services). RMS provides an additional layer between the application and the files on disk that provides a consistent method of data organization and access across multiple 3GL and 4GL languages. RMS provides four different methods of accessing data; sequential, relative record number access, record file address access, and indexed access.

The indexed access method of reading or writing data only provides the desired outcome if in fact the file is organized as an ISAM file with the appropriate, previously defined keys. Access to data via the previously defined key(s) is extremely fast. Multiple keys, overlapping keys and key compression within the hash tables are supported. A utility to define/redefine keys in existing files is provided. Records can be deleted, although &quot;garbage collection&quot; is done via a separate utility.

==Design considerations==
IBM engineers designed the ISAM system to use a minimum amount of computer memory. The tradeoff was that the Input/Output channel, control unit, and disk were kept busier. An ISAM file consists of a collection of data records and two or three levels of index. The &quot;track index&quot; contains the highest key for each disk track on the cylinder it indexes. The &quot;cylinder index&quot; stores the highest key on a cylinder, and the disk address of the corresponding track index. An optional &quot;master index&quot;, usually used only for large files, contains the highest key on a cylinder index track and the disk address of that cylinder index. Once a file is loaded data records are not moved; inserted records are placed into a separate &quot;overflow area&quot;. To locate a record by key the indexes on disk are searched by a complex self-modifying channel program. This increased the busy time of the channel, control unit, and disk. With increased physical and virtual memory sizes in later systems this was seen as inefficient, and VSAM was developed to alter the tradeoff between memory usage and disk activity.

ISAM&#x27;s use of self-modifying channel programs later caused difficulties for CP-67 support of OS/360, since CP-67 copied an entire channel program into fixed memory when the I/O operation was started and translated virtual addresses to real addresses.

<doc id="252765" wikidata="Q888795" url="?curid=252765" title="List of governors of Guam">
<text>The governor of Guam ( / ) is the head of government of Guam and the commander-in-chief of the Guam National Guard, whose responsibilities also include making the annual State of the Island (formerly the State of the Territory) addresses to the Guam Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that Guam&#x27;s public laws are enforced. The position was created in 1968, through the passage of the Guam Elected Governors Act which took effect in 1970. Guam elected its first civilian governor in 1970 with the inauguration of former governor Carlos Camacho.

The current governor is Lou Leon Guerrero, a Democrat who was inaugurated on January 7, 2019, following her election in 2018.

==Powers and duties==
The governor has a duty to enforce Guam&#x27;s public laws, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Guam Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to commute or grant pardons to criminal sentences, except in cases of treason and impeachment. The governor is given the power to control government budgeting and appoint many officials (including many judges).

Unlike the other government departments that compose the executive branch of government, the governor is themselves head of the state executive department. The governor may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, issuing symbolic proclamations or commencing the Liberation Day parade.

As the commander-in-chief of the Guam National Guard, the governor, as well as the president, may call on the Guard at a moment&#x27;s notice to provide defense for the island, in a state of emergency.

The governor also delivers the annual State of the Island address (similar to the State of the State address in the US) to a special session of the Guam Legislature. The speech is given to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually, or in older constitutions described as being &quot;from time to time&quot;, on the state or condition of the territory.

==Seat and residence==

Sitting along Route 1, the governor&#x27;s seat of power is located in Adelup in the Ricardo J. Bordallo Governor&#x27;s Complex, named after the island&#x27;s 2nd and 4th governor, Ricardo Bordallo.

The governor lives in their official residence at the Government House in Agaña Heights. The island&#x27;s former Spanish and American military governors had lived in the Governor&#x27;s Palace in the Plaza de España (Hagåtña) until its destruction in the shelling of Hagåtña during the reconquest of Guam in World War II.

==Election process==
===Eligibility===
According to the Elective Governors Act:

&quot;No person shall be eligible for election to the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor unless he/she is an eligible voter and has been for five consecutive years immediately preceding the election a citizen of the United States and a bona fide resident of Guam and will be, at the time of taking office, at least thirty years of age. The Governor shall maintain his/her official residence in Guam during his/her incumbency.&quot;

To be eligible, a candidate for Governor of Guam must:
*an eligible voter of Guam
*a United States citizen
*at least thirty years of age.
*has lived in Guam for five years, preceding the general election.

===Election===
According to the Elective Governor Acts of 1968, the Governor of Guam, together with the Lieutenant Governor, shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the people who are qualified to vote for the members of the Legislature of Guam. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be chosen jointly, by the casting by each voter of a single vote applicable to both offices. The first election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor was held on November 3, 1970, with the election of Governor Carlos Camacho and Lt. Governor Kurt Moylan. 
Beginning in 1974, Guam&#x27;s Governor and Lieutenant Governor is elected by direct vote, on the first Tuesday of November. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall hold office for a term of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified.

===Inauguration===

The Governor of Guam usually takes the oath of office on the first Monday of January. In past inaugurations, however, the governor-elect and lieutenant governor-elect would take the oath of office past midnight on Monday morning.

Traditionally, the lieutenant governor-elect takes the oath first and delivers his inaugural remarks, followed then by the incoming governor-elect. As soon as the governor takes the oath of office, four ruffles and flourishes are played then followed by &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; and a 21-gun salute. The newly inaugurated governor delivers his inaugural address, an opportunity for the new leader to state his goals for the next 4 years.

===Oath of office===
Pursuant to the Guam Organic Act, the governor&#x27;s term of office begins at midnight on the first Monday of January of the year following the election. The day marks the beginning of the four-year term of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Guam. Before executing the powers as the Governor of Guam, the governor must take an oath of office:

In line with traditional oath-takings, governors have traditionally palmed a Bible and have added, &quot;So help me God!&quot; at the end of their oaths. The Governor of Guam is sworn in by the Chief Justice of Guam.

==Succession==
==Tenure and term limits==
The Governor of Guam is only limited two terms as prescribed in the Elective Governors Act:
*No person who has been elected Governor for two full successive terms shall again be eligible to hold that office until one full term has intervened.
*The term of the elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall commence on the first Monday of January following the date of election.
However, a former governor can be re-elected once again only after a full term has passed.

==History==
===Spanish era===

In 1565, Miguel López de Legazpi formally declared Spanish sovereignty over the Mariana Islands. However, there was no permanent Spanish presence on the island and it was ruled from the Philippines as part of the Spanish East Indies by the Governor-General of the Philippines. Diego Luis de San Vitores established a mission on Guam in 1668, but Francisco de Irrisari was the first person to take the title &quot;Governor&quot; in June 1676, amidst the Spanish-Chamorro Wars. Antonio de Saravia, who arrived in June 1681, was the first to receive his appointment as governor from the Spanish throne, meaning that, technically, he was no longer subordinate to rule from the Philippines or Mexico.

===American capture of the territory (1898)===
===Political instability (1898–1899)===
===American Naval governors (1899–1941)===
===Japanese military governors (1941–1944)===

<doc id="252768" wikidata="Q135863" url="?curid=252768" title="Algonquin people">
<text>The Algonquin people are an Indigenous people who now live in Eastern Canada and parts of the United states. They speak the Algonquin language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe (including Oji-Cree), Mississaugas, and Nipissing, with whom they form the larger Anicinàpe (Anishinaabeg) group. Algonquins are known by many names, including Omàmiwinini (plural: Omàmiwininiwak, &quot;downstream man/men&quot;) and Abitibiwinni (pl.: [[Abitibiwinni First Nation|Abitibiwinnik]] &quot;men [living] halfway across the water&quot;) or the more generalised name of Anicinàpe.

Though known by several names in the past, such as &quot;Algoumequin&quot;, the most common term &quot;Algonquin&quot; has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word (): &quot;they are our relatives/allies.&quot; The much larger heterogeneous group of Algonquian-speaking peoples, who, according to Brian Conwell, stretch from Virginia to the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson Bay, was named after the tribe.

Most Algonquins live in Quebec. The nine recognized status Algonquin bands in that province and one in Ontario have a combined population of about 17,002. In addition, there are additional non-status communities, some of which are controversial. Algonquins are original Indigenous People of southern Quebec and eastern Ontario in Canada.

Many Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally or specifically . The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the Cree language.
Traditionally, the Algonquins lived in either birch bark or wooden &quot;mìkiwàms&quot;.

Traditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of &quot;Midewiwin&quot; (the Path of the Heart). They believed they were surrounded by many &quot;manitòk&quot; or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many Algonquin practice traditional &quot;Midewiwin&quot; or a syncretic merging of Christianity and Midewiwin.

In the oral history of the Great Anishinaabeg Migration, the Algonquins say they migrated from the Atlantic coast. Together with other &quot;Anicinàpek&quot;, they arrived at the &quot;First Stopping Place&quot; near Montreal. While the other &quot;Anicinàpe&quot; peoples continued their journey up the St. Lawrence River, the Algonquins settled along &quot;Kitcisìpi&quot; (the Ottawa River), a long-important highway for commerce, cultural exchange and transportation. Algonquin identity, though, was not fully realized until after the dividing of the Anicinàpek at the &quot;Third Stopping Place&quot;. Scholars have used the oral histories, archeology, and linguistics to estimate this took place about 2000 years ago, near present-day Detroit.

After contact with the Europeans, especially the French and Dutch, the Algonquin nations became active in the fur trade. This led them to fight against the powerful Haudenosaunee, whose confederacy was based in present-day New York. In 1570, the Algonquins formed an alliance with the Innu (Montagnais) to the east, whose territory extended to the ocean. Culturally, Omàmìwininì (Algonquin) and the Mississaugas (Michi Saagiig) were not part of the Ojibwe–Odawa–Potawatomi alliance known as the Council of Three Fires, though they did maintain close ties. Omàmìwininìwak (Algonquins) maintained stronger cultural ties with the Wendat, Abenaki, Atikamekw, and Cree, along with the Innu, as related above.

==History==
===French contact===

 Algonquin first met Europeans when Samuel de Champlain came upon a party led by the Chief Tessouat at Tadoussac, in eastern present-day Quebec, in the summer of 1603. They were celebrating a recent victory over the Iroquois, with the allied Montagnais and Etchemins (Malecite). Champlain did not understand that Algonquins were socially united by a strong totem/clan system rather than the European-styled political concept of nationhood. The several Algonquin bands each had its own chief. Within each band, the chief depended on political approval from each of the band&#x27;s clan leaders. Champlain needed to cultivate relationships with numerous chiefs and clan leaders. From 1603, some of the Algonquins allied with the French under Champlain. This alliance proved useful to the Algonquin, who previously had little to no access to European firearms.

Champlain made his first exploration of the Ottawa River during May 1613 and reached the fortified village at Morrison Island. Unlike the other Algonquin communities, the did not change location with the seasons. They had chosen a strategic point astride the trade route between the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. They prospered through the collection of beaver pelts from Indigenous traders passing through their territory. They also were proud of their corn fields.

At first, the French used the term &quot;Algonquin&quot; only for a second group, the &quot;Wàwàckeciriniwak&quot;. However, by 1615, they applied the name to all of the Algonquin bands living along the Ottawa River. Because of keen interest by tribes to gain control of the lower Ottawa River, the and the came under fierce opposition. These two large groups allied together, under the leadership of &quot;Sachem&quot; (Carolus) Charles Pachirini, to maintain the identity and territory.

===French-Indian War/Seven Years&#x27; War===
The Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) drove Algonquins from their lands. The Haudenosaunee were aided by having been traded arms by the Dutch, and later by the English. The Haudenosaunee and the English defeated the French and Algonquins in the 1620s, and, led by Sir David Kirke, occupied New France.

In 1623, having realized the occupation of New France demonstrated French colonial vulnerability, the French began to trade muskets to Algonquins and their allies. French Jesuits began to seek Algonquin conversions to Roman Catholicism.

Through all of these years, the Haudenosaunee never attacked the fortress. But, in 1642, they made a surprise winter raid, attacking Algonquins while most of their warriors were absent, and causing severe casualties. On March 6, 1647 (Ash Wednesday), a large Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) war party attacked the living near Trois-Rivières and almost exterminated them. The were still at Morrison Island in 1650 and inspired respect with their 400 warriors. When the French retreated from Wendat (Huron) country that year, Tessouat was reported to have had the superior of the Jesuit mission suspended by his armpits because he refused to offer him the customary presents for being allowed to travel through Algonquin territory.

Some joined the mission at Sillery, where they were mostly destroyed by an infectious disease epidemic by 1676. Encouraged by the French, others remained at Trois-Rivières. Their settlement at nearby Pointe-du-Lac continued until about 1830. That year the last 14 families, numbering about 50, moved to Kanesatake near Oka. (The families who stayed in Trois Rivieres can be found in the Algonquin census of Trois Rivieres in the mid-19th century).

===18th century to present===

The Lake of Two Mountains band of Algonquins were located just west of the Island of Montreal, and were signatories to the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The Sulpician Mission of the Mountain was founded at Montreal in 1677.

In 1717, the King of France granted the Mohawk in Quebec a tract of land 9 miles long by 9 miles wide about 40 miles to the northwest of Montreal, under the condition that they leave the island of Montreal. Sulpician Missionaries set up a trading post at the village in 1721 and attracted a large number of Haudenosaunee converts to Christianity to the area. The settlement of Kanesatake was formally founded as a Catholic mission, a seigneury under the supervision of the Sulpician Order for 300 Christian Mohawk, about 100 Algonquins, and approximately 250 Nipissing peoples &quot;in their care&quot;. Over time the Sulpicians claimed total control of the land, gaining a deed that gave them legal title. But the Haudenosaunee (Mohawks), Algonquins, and Nipissing understood that this land was being held in trust for them.

The Sulpician mission village of Lake of Two Mountains (Lac des Deux Montagnes), west of Montreal, became known both by its Algonquin language name &quot;Oka&quot; (meaning &quot;pickerel&quot;), and the Mohawk language &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; (&quot;sandy place&quot;); however, Algonquin also called the village as &quot;Ganashtaageng&quot; after the Mohawk language name.

Algonquin warriors continued to fight in alliance with France until the British conquest of Quebec in 1760, during the Seven Years&#x27; War. After the British took over colonial rule of Canada, their officials sought to make allies of the First Nations, and the Algonquin, along with many other First Nations signed the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which was then ratified in 1764 as the Treaty of Niagara. Subsequently, fighting on behalf of the British Crown, Algonquins took part in the Barry St Leger campaign during the American Revolutionary War.

Following the American Revolutionary War, and later the War of 1812, the Lake of Two Mountains Algonquins found their territory increasingly encroached on by Loyalist settlers. Beginning in the 1820s and 1930s, the lumber industry began to move up the Ottawa valley. Algonquin became increasingly displaced as a result. Beginning in the 1820s, Algonquin Grand Chief Constant Pinesi sent a series of letters petitioning the British Crown for Algonquin Territorial Recognition previously agreed upon in the Treaties of 1701 and 1764, ratified by Algonquins and the British Crown. No responses were forthcoming from the British, and the Algonquins began to be relegated to a string of small reserves beginning in the 1830s.

Algonquins who agreed to move to these reserves or joined other historical bands were federally &quot;recognized&quot;. Others maintained their attachment to the traditional territory and fur trading, and chose not to re-locate. These Algonquins were later called &quot;stragglers&quot; in the Ottawa and Pontiac counties with some eventually settling in small towns such as Renfrew, Whitney, and Eganville as the 19th Century progressed. Many of these Algonquins were not recognized as &quot;Status Indians&quot;.

The location of the former Lake of Two Mountains Band came to be known as Kahnesatake. As a large majority of the Algonquin population had left the area, with only the Christian Haudenosaunee and a few Algonquins remaining, it became recognized as a Mohawk reserve (though many in the community have at least partial Algonquin Ancestry).

Algonquins living in the northern regions of Algonquin Territory gradually moved to towns such as present day Témiscaming, and Mattawa, amongst others in Ontario and Quebec, as territorial encroachment by settlers, and lumber and resource companies increased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries or various reserves set up in their traditional territories. In recent years, tensions with the lumber industry have flared up again among Algonquin communities, in response to the practice of clear-cutting.

In Ontario, an Algonquin land claim has been ongoing since 1983, encompassing much of the southeastern part of the province, stretching from near North Bay to near Hawkesbury and including Ottawa, Pembroke, and most of Algonquin Provincial Park. The Algonquins never relinquished title to this area. An agreement-in-principle between the Algonquins of Ontario, the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario was reached in 2015. Many Algonquins dispute both the validity of both this settlement and the organization of the Algonquins of Ontario as a whole.

In 2000, Algonquins from Timiskaming First Nation played a significant part in the local popular opposition to the plan to convert Adams Mine into a garbage dump.

==Economy==

Historical Algonquin society was largely hunting and fishing-based. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility. They used materials that were light and easy to transport. Canoes were made of birch bark, sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce resin and bear grease. During winter, toboggans were used to transport material, and people used snowshoes to get around. The women used (cradleboards) to carry their babies. It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the &quot;tikinàgan&quot; on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings. The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.

Algonquian-speaking people also practiced agriculture, particularly south of the Great Lakes, where the climate allows for a longer growing season. Notable indigenous crops historically farmed by Algonquins are the sunflower and tobacco. Around 800CE, Eastern Algonquins adopted maize agriculture from their neighbors in the interior. Even among groups who mainly hunted, agricultural products were an important source of food. They obtained what was needed by trading with or raiding societies that practiced more agriculture. Eastern Algonquins created pots that could withstand not only thermal stress but the mechanical stress of rough use.

Archaeological sites on Morrison Island near Pembroke, within the territory of the later , reveal a 1,000-year-old culture that manufactured copper tools and weapons. Copper ore was extracted north of Lake Superior and distributed down to present-day northern New York. Local pottery artifacts from this period show widespread similarities that indicate the continuing use of the river for cultural exchange throughout the Canadian Shield and beyond.

Beginning at the latest in c. 1 CE, the Algonquin Nation inhabited the islands and shores along Kitcisìpi (Algonquin Language name translating to The Great River, known now as the Ottawa River). By the 17th century European Explorers found them well established as a hunter-gatherer society in control of the river. On Morrison Island, at the location where 5,000-year-old copper artifacts were discovered, the levied a toll on canoe flotillas descending the river.

==Ethnobotany==
Algonquins of Quebec gather the berries of &quot;Ribes glandulosum&quot; and &quot;Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides&quot; as food, and eat and sell the fruit of &quot;Vaccinium myrtilloides&quot;.
They take an infusion of &quot;Epigaea repens&quot; leaves for kidney disorders and apply a poultice of the gum or needles of &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; to open sores, insect bites, boils and infections. The needles are a sudatory for women after childbirth and are infused for a laxative tea, while the roots treat heart disease.

==Communities==
At the time of their first meeting with the French in 1603, the various Algonquin bands probably had a combined population somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,000. The British estimate in 1768 was 1,500. As of 2000, there are close to 8,000 Algonquins in Canada, organized into ten separate First Nations: nine in Quebec and one in Ontario.

<text>The governor of New Hampshire is the head of government of the U.S. state of New Hampshire and is commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. 

The incumbent governor is Republican Kelly Ayotte, who took office on January 9, 2025. The longest-serving governor is John Taylor Gilman, who served as governor for 14 years, from 1794 to 1805 and from 1813 to 1816.

==Governors==

New Hampshire was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on June 21, 1788. Before it declared its independence, New Hampshire was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

The original 1776 Constitution of New Hampshire did not provide for a chief executive. The office of President was created by the 1784 constitution, and renamed Governor in 1792. Governors served one-year terms until an 1877 amendment increased this to two years. There have never been any term limits for the office, nor is there a lieutenant governor; should the office become vacant, the president of the New Hampshire Senate acts as governor.

<doc id="252770" wikidata="Q2292793" url="?curid=252770" title="Canuck">
<text>Canuck ( ) is a slang term for a Canadian, though its semantic nuances are manifold. A variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of the term. The term &quot;Kanuck&quot; is first recorded in 1835 as an Americanism, originally referring to Dutch Canadians (which included German Canadians) or French Canadians. By the 1850s, the spelling with a &quot;C&quot; became predominant. Today, many Canadians and others use &quot;Canuck&quot; as a mostly affectionate term for any Canadian.

Johnny Canuck is a folklore hero who was created as a political cartoon in 1869 and was later re-invented as a Second World War action hero in 1942. The Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), has used a version of &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; as their team logos.

The Canadian military has used the term colloquially for several projects: Operation Canuck, the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck and the Fleet 80 Canuck.

Captain Canuck is a Canadian comic book superhero who first appeared in &quot;Captain Canuck&quot; #1 (July 1975). The series was the first successful Canadian comic book since the collapse of the nation&#x27;s comic book industry following World War II.

==Origin==
Historically the etymology was labelled as unclear, with its most likely origins according to the 2017 Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles, 2nd edition being:
* &quot;kanata&quot;, &quot;village&quot; (see name of Canada)
* &quot;Can&quot;ada + -&quot;uc&quot; (Algonquian noun suffix)
* &quot;Kanaka&quot;, derived from the Hawaiian &quot;Kanaka&quot;.

According to &quot;The Etymology of Canuck&quot; by Jacob Adler with contributions from Mitford M. Mathews, the word &quot;Canuck&quot; connects back to the term &quot;kanaka&quot;, which is defined as someone indigenous to Hawaii. The term spread beginning in the 1800s however, when &quot;kanaka&quot; acquired a racist connotation, and was used to refer to Polynesians with darker skin tones negatively.

==Usage and examples==
Canadians use &quot;Canuck&quot; as an affectionate or merely descriptive term for their nationality.

If familiar with the term, most citizens of other nations, including the United States, also use it affectionately, though there are individuals who may use it as a derogatory term.

===History===
* &quot;Canuck&quot; also has the derived meanings of a Canadian pony (rare) and a French-Canadian patois (very rare).
* Johnny Canuck, a personification of Canada who appeared in early political cartoons of the 1860s resisting Uncle Sam&#x27;s bullying. Johnny Canuck was revived in 1942 by Leo Bachle to defend Canada against the Nazis. The Vancouver Canucks have adopted a personification of Johnny Canuck on their alternate hockey sweater.
* As the historical nickname for three Canadian-built aircraft from the 20th century: the Curtiss JN-4C training biplane, with some 1,260 airframes built; the Avro CF-100 jet fighter; and the Fleet 80 Canuck two-seat side-by-side trainer.
* One of the first uses of &quot;Canuck&quot;in the form of &quot;Kanuk&quot;specifically referred to Dutch Canadians as well as the French.
* Operation Canuck was the designated name of a British SAS raid led by a Canadian captain, Buck McDonald in January 1945.
*The Canuck letter became a focal point during the US 1972 Democratic primaries, when a letter published in the Manchester Union Leader implied Democratic contender Senator Edmund Muskie was prejudiced against French-Canadians. He soon ended his campaign as a result. The letter was later discovered to have been written by the Nixon campaign in an attempt to sabotage Muskie.
* A brand of firearms engineered and distributed by O&#x27;Dell Engineering Ltd since 2014 includes the Canuck 1911, Canuck Over Under and Canuck Shotgun.

===Media===
* In the opening of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s 1938 play Our Town, Polish and &quot;Canuck families&quot; are mentioned as living on the outskirts of the prototypical 1901 New Hampshire town.
* In 1975, in comics by Richard Comely, Captain Canuck is a super-agent for Canadians&#x27; security, with Redcoat and Kebec being his sidekicks. (Kebec is claimed to be unrelated to Capitaine Kébec of a French-Canadian comic published two years earlier.) Captain Canuck had enhanced strength and endurance thanks to being bathed in alien rays during a camping trip. The captain was reintroduced in the mid-1990s, and again in 2004.
* The Marvel Comics character Wolverine is often referred to affectionately as &quot;the Ol&#x27; Canucklehead&quot; due to his Canadian heritage.
* Soviet Canuckistan was an insult used by Pat Buchanan in response to Canada&#x27;s reaction to racial profiling by US Customs agents.

===Sport===
* The Canada national rugby union team (men&#x27;s) is officially nicknamed Canucks.
* The Canucks rugby Club, playing in Calgary since 1968.
* The Crazy Canucks, Canadian alpine ski racers who competed successfully on the World Cup circuit in the 1970s.
* The Vancouver Canucks professional ice hockey team, with their former goaltender, Roberto Luongo, having a depiction of Johnny Canuck on his goalie mask. The full body Johnny Canuck was then updated in 2009 by graphic designer Evan Biswanger.
* During the Vancouver 2010 Olympics official Canadian Olympic gear bore the term.

<doc id="252772" wikidata="Q309869" url="?curid=252772" title="Burebista">
<text>Burebista () was the king of the Getae and Dacian tribes from 82/61BC to 45/44BC. He was the first king who successfully unified the tribes of the Dacian kingdom, which comprised the area located between the Danube, Tisza, and Dniester rivers, and modern day Romania and Moldova. In the 7th and 6thcenturies BC it became home to the Thracian peoples, including the Getae and the Dacians. From the 4thcentury to the middle of the 2ndcentury BC the Dacian peoples were influenced by La Tène Celts who brought new technologies with them into Dacia. Sometime in the 2ndcentury BC, the Dacians expelled the Celts from their lands. Dacians often warred with neighbouring tribes, but the relative isolation of the Dacian peoples in the Carpathian Mountains allowed them to survive and even to thrive. By the 1stcentury BC the Dacians had become the dominant power.

From 61 BC onwards Burebista pursued a series of conquests that expanded the Dacian kingdom. The tribes of the Boii and Taurisci were destroyed early in his campaigns, followed by the conquest of the Bastarnae and probably the Scordisci peoples. He led raids throughout Thrace, Macedonia, and Illyria. From 55BC the Greek cities on the west coast of the Black Sea were conquered one after another. These campaigns inevitably culminated in conflict with Rome in 48BC, at which point Burebista gave his support to Pompey. This in turn made him an enemy to Julius Caesar, who decided to start a campaign against Dacia. This plan fell through in 44BC when Caesar was assassinated. Burebista himself was assassinated in a plot by the Dacian aristocracy at around the same time.

After Burebista&#x27;s death, the empire he had created broke up into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86AD the Dacian king, Decebalus, successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians that ended in disaster. A second invasion brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until Trajan became emperor in 98AD. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia. The first, in 101–102AD, concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them, leading to a second invasion of Dacia in 106AD that ended the independence of the Dacian kingdom.

== Early references ==
Only few ancient sources on Burebista survive: Strabo: Geographica 7.3.5, 7.3.11 and 16.2.39 (who spells his name Byrebistas and Boirebistas); Jordanes: Getica67 (spells his name Buruista); a marble inscription found in Balchik, Bulgaria (now housed at the National Museum in Sofia), which represents a decree by the citizens of Dionysopolis about Akornion and another inscription found in Nesebar.

==Dacian kingdom==
The area roughly located between the Danube, Tisza and Dniester riversapproximately coinciding with modern-day Romaniabecame home to a varied group of Thracian peoples, including the Getae and Dacians, sometime around the 7th to 6thcenturies BC. The Getae and Dacians are related but distinct peoples that are sometimes treated as a single group under the name of Geto-Dacians. The Getae and the Dacians shared many cultural and linguistic similarities. Living in the lower Danube basin, the Getae were able to establish regular trade with the Greek cities along the coast of the Black Sea. The Dacians were located in the Carpatho-Danubian basin along the southern border of the Carpathian Mountains. This relative geographic isolation allowed the Dacians to survive catastrophic strugglesoften with the Getaeand thrive to become the dominant tribe by the 1stcentury BC.

Before Burebista&#x27;s rule, the Dacians had experienced a succession of kings through the period 450 to 60BC. The kings included Dromichaetes, Oroles, and Rubobostes in the 3rd and 2ndcenturies BC. From the 4thcentury BC to the 2ndcentury BC the LaTène Celts of the Danube, Alpines, and Balkans influenced the Dacian culture. LaTène material culture was found in the central and north-west regions of Dacia. The development of a LaTène-based economy in the 3rd and 2ndcenturies BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found among both the Transylvanian Dacians under the rule of Rubobostes and the Moldavian and Muntenian Getae in Argedava.

It is from the LaTène that the Dacians were introduced to the potter&#x27;s wheel, superior metal-working techniques, and probably a tradition of minting coins. In homes were found a combination of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and certain Celtic-style graves contain Dacian style vessels. This suggests a sort of co-existence and fusion between the cultures. Sometime after around 150BC, however, evidence of LaTène culture peters out, around the same time the Dacian culture began to mature, as evidenced by population and economic growth. Under Rubobstes the authority of the Dacians appears to have increased, thus ending the dominance of the Celtic culture, and leading to the Celts being expelled from the area or merging into the culture, or both. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that relations between Dacians and Celts living in the areas north and west of Dacia continued. Painted ceramics of late LaTène-style have been found in Dacian sites in west and central Dacia. Some of these ceramics were imported while others were made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic style. A stable monarchy, however, only developed when Burebista became king. Burebista&#x27;s accession came with the expulsion of Celts around 60BC when his forces moved through to the middle Danube region, and with the support of the religious establishment and leaders in Dacia which brought around a stricter moral code in the Dacian kingdom. Around this time the pottery of the Dacian style began appearing in Celtic settlements in Central Europe, including the area covered by the former Yugoslavia, especially in Gomolava, Yugoslavia, and Budapest, Hungary.

==Reign of Burebista==
===Date of ascension===
The exact date that Burebista came to reign over the Dacians is debated among scholars; University of Illinois professor Keith Hitchins gave a starting date for Burebista&#x27;s reign of 82BC, while historian Matthew Bunson, and authors John Middleton and Michael Schmitz suggest a starting date around 61–60 BC. The historian John Koch states that Burebista founded an empire sometime during the 1stcentury BC and that around 61BC Burebista expelled the Celts and moved into the middle Danube.

===Development of Burebista&#x27;s polity===
This alliance was probably a weakly centralized state, with a military organization similar to the one of the Hellenistic kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists such as Kris Lockyear denying the existence of a state, saying the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.

In the Orăștie Mountains, Burebista built a system of stone fortifications on high ground; the most important of such hill forts are located today in the villages of Costești, Blidaru, Piatra Roșie, and Bănița. These citadels, which exhibited Greek military architecture, coupled with the presence of Burebista and his armed forces, served to secure the Dacian people internally.

===Conquests and external policy===

====Neighbouring tribes====
From around 61 BC Burebista began to lead a series of campaigns of conquest against neighbouring tribes and clans. In 60/59BC he defeated and conquered the Boii, who were led by Critasiros, and the Taurisci tribes dwelling in the Middle Danube, in modern Bohemia and Slovakia. The Boii had established a tribal presence in the areas now occupied by eastern Austria and south-western Slovakia and Hungary sometime in 75–50BC. The Boii extended their influence eastward towards modern day Bratislava, Slovakia around 64–63BC. It is these Boii tribes east of the Alps that came into conflict with the Dacians and were heavily defeated in 50–40BC. These conquests were followed by the destruction of the Bastarnae peoples. Similarly, Burebista conquered a tribe that Strabo describes as living among the Illyrians and Thraciansmost likely the Scordisciwhile simultaneously conducting raids throughout Thrace, Roman Macedonia, and Illyria.

====Capture of Greek cities====
Beginning around 55 BC Burebista annexed the Greek cities on the coast of the Black Sea, occupying the Greek fortresses from Olbia to Apollonia, as well as the Danubian plain all the way to the Balkans. These conquered cities were: Olbia, Tyras, Histria, Tomis, Callatis, Odessos, Messembria, Apollonia, and Dionysopolis. Dionysopolis, however, enjoyed good relations with Burebista. An inscription dating to 48BC found in Dionysopolis and in honour of Akornion of Dionysopolis describes Akornion as the &quot;first and greatest friend&quot; of Burebista. Akornion was sent as an ambassador to Pompey to claim the title of &quot;king of kings&quot; for Burebista to be used within the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Balkans and the Near East.

===Caesar&#x27;s civil war===

Burebista inevitably came into conflict with Rome. During the Roman civil war of 49–44 BC, Pompey gained the support of Burebista through Akornion of Dionysopolis. Pompey himself had recognized the might of Burebista and Dacia after their successful conquests against the Greek Black Sea cities. Caesar, however, ended any alliance between Pompey and Burebista at the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar was also aware of the growing strength of the Dacians and had planned to lead an attack against Burebista. Burebista at this time had a force that may have numbered up to 200,000 menthough it is disputed whether this force was an actual military force or the number of ablebodied men within the kingdom. Regardless, Dacia was a formidable power that Caesar perceived as a threat to Rome. Caesar was never able to start his intended campaign because he was assassinated in 44BC, with Burebista also being killed in a civil uprising in either 45 or 44BC.

==Death==
Burebista may have outlived Caesar for only a short time. In the same year Caesar was assassinated, Burebista was killed in a plot by the Dacian aristocracy, who saw a centralized state as leading to a reduction in their privileges. After his death, the Dacian kingdom dissolved, with the exception of the enclave around the Orăștie Mountains, while the rest became various smaller kingdoms. After Burebista&#x27;s death, the kingdom was divided into four parts, to be ruled by the religious elite. By the time of Augustus Dacia had broken further into five parts.

==Dacia after Burebista==
In the time following Burebista&#x27;s death, and between the rule of Tiberius and the rule of Domitian, Dacian activity was minimal. The Dacians were forced into a defensive state where their main activity was keeping the Romans out of Dacian territories. The regional factions that remained posed no substantial threat to the Roman empire, and Roman sources stop mentioning plans for Roman invasions during this time. Dacian power resurged during the reigns of Duraswho reigned 68–87ADand peaked during the reign of Decebaluswho reigned from 85/87-106AD. By this time the Dacian tribes had united once more, under the rule of Decebalus, and again posed a threat to Rome.

Decebalus&#x27; reign saw nearly constant warfare between the Dacians and Roman administrations south of the Danube. Around 85AD raiding resumed in Moesia, Illyria, and Macedonia, culminating in the death of the Roman Governor of Moesia, Oppius Sabinius. In response, Domitian launched a campaign the same year under the command of the Praetorian Prefect Cornelius Fuscus. Domitian ignored Decebalus&#x27; offer of peace, an error which caused the Romans to suffer a disastrous defeat, losing not only Fuscus, but his forces and the Roman standards and war machines. A second expedition was launched in 88AD, this time under the command of Tettius Julianus. This second campaign was somewhat victorious as both sides suffered massive casualties in battle. However, revolts and defections forced Domitian to negotiate a hasty peace treaty with Decebalus in 89AD. This peace had benefits and costs to both sides: Rome had to pay financial tributes and provide technological assistance to Dacia; in exchange, Dacia effectively became a client kingdom of Rome, acting as a bulkhead for the empire, separating Rome from other warring tribes.

This peace lasted for around a decade, until Trajan became emperor in 98AD. Immediately upon becoming emperor, Trajan travelled to the frontier stretching from Pannonia to Moesia, where he worked to strengthen the fortifications. In 101–102AD Trajan assembled an army of up to 150,000 men to send against Decebalus&#x27; 50,000. The army was split into two and entered into Dacian territory at two points along the frontier. The columns met at Tibiscum and marched together towards Sarmizegetusa. At Tapae they encountered and defeated the Dacian force. This in turn forced Decebalus to sue for peace. Trajan agreed but imposed harsh terms against the Dacians. Decebalus failed to meet the terms of the peace, and in 105 Trajan launched a second campaign against him. By 106 Trajan had completed the conquest of Dacia, ending its existence as an independent kingdom.

==Legacy==
The image of fearless and noble Dacians as predecessors to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist movements in the late 1920s and 1930s. On one hand, the Dacians were often used in discourses claiming an ethnically pure origin for the Romanian people. At the same time, however, the Romans were preferred instead when the objective was portraying Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation.

In the 1960s statues were erected for the two leaders of the Dacian kingdom, Burebista and Decebalus. These came as part of a gradual process of disassociating Socialist Romania from the Soviet Union. The statues depict the kings as freedom fighters, and nationwide celebrations were held for the anniversaries of ancient battles. Additionally, two government-funded film productions were created as part of this same process. Both films focus on the history of Dacia in the 1st and 2ndcentury AD and the exploits of Decebalus, while Burebista is almost ignored.

Starting in the 1970s, the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime used nationalistic and questionable interpretations of ancient history (Protochronism) to legitimize its rule. In 1980 the Romanian government declared a celebration of the 2,050th anniversary of the founding of the &quot;unitary and centralized&quot; Dacian state of Burebista, drawing comparisons with Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania and claiming an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceaușescu. The epic movie &quot;Burebista&quot; (1980) based on the king&#x27;s life was released the same year, and celebrated him as the Romanian &quot;pater patriae&quot;. This commemoration led the press to note &quot;similarities&quot; between Burebista and Ceaușescu, and even professional historians such as Ion Horațiu Crișan spoke about Burebista in ways similar to how party activists spoke about Ceaușescu.

Burebista and his descendants are considered by Romanian nationalists to be the true ancestors of their nation. Historian László Kürti describes this as an imaginary history, and notes that during the regime of Ceaușescu this alternate history was used as a political device. In 1984 the brother of President Ceaușescu, Ilie Ceaușescu, published a treatise stating that; &quot;[t]he archaeological evidence conclusively shows the uninterrupted ethnic, political, and military continuity of the Romanians.&quot; Kürti notes that similar political devices are used by Hungarians to promote their claim to the same Transylvanian region, part of Romania.

<text>Hiisi (; plural &quot;hiidet&quot; ) is a term in Finnic mythologies, originally denoting sacred localities and later on various types of mythological entities.

In later, Christian-influenced folklore, they are depicted as demonic or trickster-like entities, often the autochthonous, pagan inhabitants of the land, similar in this respect to mythological giants. They are found near salient promontories, ominous crevasses, large boulders, potholes, woods, hills, and other outstanding geographical features or rough terrain.

==Origin and etymology==
Hiisi was originally a spirit of hill forests . In Estonian &quot;hiis&quot; (or &quot;his&quot;) means a sacred grove in trees, usually on elevated ground. In the spells (&quot;magic songs&quot;) of the Finns the term Hiisi is often used in association with a hill or mountain, as a personage he also associated with the hills and mountains, such as the owner or ruler of the same. His name is also commonly associated with forests, and some forest animals.

More recent speculation, by Mauno Koski and others, associates the Finnish &quot;Hiisi&quot; and the Estonian &quot;Hiis&quot; primarily with burial sites, or sacred areas associated with burial sites; with a secondary meaning of &quot;hiisi&quot; applied to dominant, exceptional or anomalous geographical features. Following the Christianization of Finland and Estonia these meanings may have been lost or become unclear, which may have led to the application of anthropomorphism to &quot;hiisi&quot; sites, as &quot;giant&#x27;s ...&quot;, or the emergence of Hiisi or Hiis as a proper noun, the name of a deity or spirit.

It has been supposed that Hiisi&#x27;s evil nature has been magnified over time, starting with the Christianization of Finland in the 12th and 13th centuries. In more recent times his nature has been nearly identical with that of a Christian devil, or even &quot;the&quot; Devil. In Bishop Mikael Agricola&#x27;s list of Finnish pagan gods Hiisi is said to have been a god of forest game or fur, sharing this attribute with a similar god, Tapio.

===Folklore===
Oral folklore concerning &quot;hiisi&quot; mostly describes creatures that dwelt in &quot;hiisi&quot; sites, typically trolls or giants. Many of the stories describe how odd rock formations or other features of the landscape were created by the actions of these creatures.

Much of the recorded folklore about &quot;hiisi&quot; comes from the village of Narva in Vesilahti, Finland. There are tales of cauldrons of coins being caught by fishermen after having rolled down the cliff at Hiidennokka, as well as tales of how the cape of Hiidennokka was created by giants throwing rocks. One of these tales takes on a Christian element, as the giants throw rocks into the sea to prevent people going to church by boat.

Later the original aspect of nature&#x27;s awesomeness inherent in the &quot;hiidet&quot; was diminished, and they passed into folklore as purely evil spirits vaguely analogous to trolls. According to this later view, &quot;hiidet&quot; were often small in size, but others were gigantic. &quot;Hiidet&quot; could travel in a noisy procession and attack people who did not give way to them. If somebody left their door open, a &quot;hiisi&quot; could come inside and steal something. If you were chased by a &quot;hiisi&quot;. you should seek safety in a cultivated area. In folklore, it was the cultivated areas that were blessed in contrast to the pagan holiness residing in the awesome and forbidding features of raw nature, and an evil &quot;hiisi&quot; could not step inside areas sanctified by cultivation.

===Geographical objects and names===
In 1933 a Finnish archaeologist, Aarne Michaël Tallgren, identified 15 or 16 potential Hiisi locations, and in 1967 a linguist, Mauno Koski, identified 14 Iron Age cemeteries as Hiisi sites. Both based their lists primarily on the presence of an element of the word &quot;hiisi&quot; in placenames. These locations include cup marked stones, sacred trees and springs. The term &quot;hiisi&quot; appears as a compound element in placenames such as &quot;Hiisimäki&quot; [&quot;hiisi&quot; hill].

The Finnish term for a prehistoric cairn grave is a &quot;hiidenkiuas&quot; [hiisi&#x27;s sauna stove]. A giant&#x27;s kettle is called a &quot;hiidenkirnu&quot; [hiisi&#x27;s churn].

The settlement of Hiitola takes its name from the spirit.

==Linguistic usage==
=== In &quot;Magic Songs&quot;===
Numerous &quot;Magic Songs&quot; were catalogued by in the &quot;Suomen kansan muinaisia loitsurunoja&quot;, translated into English by Abercromby; these contain numerous references to &quot;Hiisi&quot; :

&quot;Hiisi&quot; was often used as a prefix in figurative expressions referring to certain things in Finnish life when casting spells (&quot;magic songs&quot;)- for example for animals (in English): &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s bandy legs&quot;: a Hare; &quot;braid of hair of Hiisi&#x27;s girl&quot;, or &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s scourge&quot;: a Snake; &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s eye&quot;: A Lizard.; &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s bird&quot;: a Hornet;. The same was used for diseases and afflictions: &quot;Hound of Hiisi&quot;: disease causing principle; &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s son&quot;, &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s cat&quot;: Toothache; &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s toadstool&quot;, &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s filth&quot;: tumors or swellings, etc. - the term &quot;Hiisi&quot; alone was also used for ailments, Tempo and Juntas&#x27;s names were also used in similar contexts.

Hiisi&#x27;s name was also used in curses - such as one against envy :

In such incantations Hiisi&#x27;s name often carries negative connotations, being associated with waste, pain, punishment and so on.

However, not all associations were negative - Hiisi is associated with good horses - in a song about travel : &quot;.. good horses live at Hiisi’s place, on the mountains there are first-rate foals. From Hiisi take a horse, from the hard land a trotting horse, the chestnut nag of Hiisi with forelock of fire .. &quot;. Hiisi was also assumed to assist forest hunters catching game. One folklore song gives Hiisi as the origin (creator) of the Horse, though claims this is a substitution and that he was originally associated with the Elk, Reindeer or Ox.

The name is also invoked in songs telling of the origins of parts of other creatures including the cat&#x27;s tail, and the raven&#x27;s neck, body, legs, and guts, and one of its eyes. One song tells of the snake&#x27;s creation from the saliva of a sleeping Hiisi, which was eaten by Syöjätär - it burned and she coughed it out - once dried out Hiisi gave it life. (Tempo and Hiisi both appear in some forms of this creation text) The Aspen tree was also said to have come from Hiisi.

The Hornet (or wasp), closely associated with Hiisi (or Tempo) is a key element in the mythic creation of steel from iron - its sting - mistaken for honey by the smith Ilmarinen was used to harden the iron into steel - this poison was indicated as the origin of steel being used as a weapon against other people. One version of the origin of copper ore has it coming from the urine of Hilahatar (Hiisi&#x27;s girl), his old woman, and his mare (horse).

===Riddles===
Hiisi&#x27;s name was used in Finnish riddles - &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s elk&quot; (or &quot;.. with a hundred horns&quot;) is a pine tree; and &quot;the neighing of Hiisi&#x27;s horse in Hiisi&#x27;s land&quot; refers to thunder.

===In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;===
:&quot;Except where noted, quotations in English are from the translation by &quot;

There are many references to Hiisi in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

In Runo VI Joukahainen&#x27;s bow has a drawstring made from the &quot;elk of Hisi&quot;.

In Runo VII an evil spirit or agent called &quot;Hiisi&quot; is blamed for Väinämöinen&#x27;s self-injury with his axe.

In Runo IX &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s cauldron&quot; is mentioned as a vessel for creating enchantments.

Lemminkäinen is associated indirectly with Hiisi. He sometimes calls on Hiisi&#x27;s aid, or others refer to the association as an insult. Hiisi&#x27;s name is invoked in spells by Lemminkäinen. In Runo XI he silences a guard dog with the words &quot;Stop the barker&#x27;s mouth, O Hiisi&quot;, and in Runo XII, when he sings a spell calling forth warriors to aid him from the earth, the water and the forests he refers to those from the water as &quot;Water-Hiisi&quot;. In Runo XI Lemminkäinen claims to have a sword with a &quot;blade forged by Hiisi&quot; and the same sword is mentioned in Runo XII as having been sharpened by Hiisi. 

Lemminkäinen&#x27;s pursuit of &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s elk&quot; is the main quest in Runo XIII. The form of this elk fulfills a curse made earlier (lines 55-58), and it is constructed by Hiisi with a head of rotten wood, horns of willow, and other parts of sticks, reeds, and so on. 

In Runo XIV Lemminkäinen is given the task of bridling the &quot;fire-breathing steed of Hiisi&quot;.

In Runo XVII the giant Antero Vipunen refers to Väinämöinen, who has entered his stomach and is troubling him, as a Hiisi (line 169, 277), and as a &quot;hound of Hiisi&quot; (line 245), while Väinämöinen refers to Vipunen&#x27;s stomach as &quot;Hiisi&#x27;s stable&quot; (line 117). 

In Runo XIX a field of serpents is said to have once been ploughed by Hiisi.

Runo XXVI includes the tale of the creation of snakes by Hiisi and Syöjätär.

In Runo XXVII the Mistress of Pohjola refers to Lemminkäinen as &quot;scamp of Hiisi&quot; (line 263).

In both Runo XXXIII and Runo L a woman is insulted as a &quot;whore of Hiisi&quot;. 

There are also figurative expressions such as &quot;Bird of Hiisi&quot; for a wasp (Runo IX).

There are some minor references that do not fit the pattern of references to evil spirits. In Runo XVIII, for instance, there is a line,&quot;Gently barked the castle&#x27;s Hiisi&quot;, though the text make it clear that is an ordinary dog (lines 476–550).

===Associated terms===
&quot;Hiitola&quot; is his home/homeland; &quot;Hippa&quot; his daughter, and &quot;Kipinatar&quot; his cat.

===Modern language usage===
Often, the English &quot;goblin&quot; is translated as &quot;hiisi&quot; in Finnish, due to the numerous similarities between the typical goblin and hiisi. In the Finnish translations of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, where the word &quot;goblin&quot; is a synonym for &quot;Orc&quot;, &quot;hiisi&quot; is used as the translation for &quot;goblin&quot;, whereas &quot;orc&quot; is translated as &quot;örkki&quot;.

In modern Finnish, hiisi and its derivatives &quot;hitto&quot; and &quot;hittolainen&quot; are mild profanities.

In the video game &quot;Noita&quot; a faction of hostile NPCs are referred to as The Hiisi.

In the Swedish fantasy drama &quot;Border&quot; (2018), the troll character Vore lays an unfertilized egg that he calls a &quot;hiisit&quot;. He says it is a changeling.

<text>The governor of Virginia is the state&#x27;s head of government and commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s official national guard. The first Constitution of 1776 created the office of governor, to be elected annually by the Virginia State Legislature. The governor could serve up to three years at a time, and once out of office, could not serve again for four years. The 1830 constitution changed the thrice-renewable one-year term length to a non-renewable three-year term, and set the start date at the first day in January following an election. This constitution also prevented governors from succeeding themselves, a prohibition that exists to the present day. The 1851 Constitution increased terms to four years and made the office elected by the people, rather than the legislature. The commencement of the Governor&#x27;s term was moved to the first day in February by the 1902 Constitution, and then to the Saturday after the second Wednesday in January by the 1971 and current Constitution.

If the office of governor is vacant due to death, impeachment and disqualification, or resignation, the lieutenant governor of Virginia becomes governor. The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1851. Prior to that a Council of State existed; it chose from among its members a president who would be &quot;lieutenant-governor&quot; and would act as governor when there was a vacancy in that office. The governor and the lieutenant governor are elected at the same time but not on the same ticket. Officially, there have been 74 governors of Virginia; the acting governors are not counted.

==Governors==
Virginia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on June 25, 1788. Before it declared its independence, Virginia was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. It seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861, and was admitted to the Confederate States of America on May 7, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, Virginia during Reconstruction constituted the First Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Virginia was readmitted to the Union on January 26, 1870.

The federal government recognized the Restored Government of Virginia, based in Wheeling, as the legitimate government in Virginia on June 25, 1861. It elected its own slate of governors, and after West Virginia was split from Virginia on June 20, 1863, the restored government relocated to Alexandria.

<doc id="252781" wikidata="Q879318" url="?curid=252781" title="List of governors of Pennsylvania">
<text>The governor of Pennsylvania is the head of government of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, as well as commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s national guard.

The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to approve or veto bills passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, as well as to convene the legislature. The governor may grant pardons except in cases of impeachment, but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons.

There have been seven presidents and 48 governors of Pennsylvania, with two governors (Robert E. Pattison and Gifford Pinchot) serving non-consecutive terms, totaling 55 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, Thomas Mifflin, who served three full terms as governor in addition to two years as President of the Continental Congress. The shortest term belonged to John C. Bell Jr., who served only 19 days as acting governor after his predecessor, Edward Martin, resigned. 

The current governor is Josh Shapiro, who took office on January 17, 2023.

==Governors==

Pennsylvania was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on December 12, 1787. Before it declared its independence, Pennsylvania was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

===Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council===
The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the state&#x27;s executive branch, with a president as its head. The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.

The constitution created the position of &quot;vice-president&quot;, though no provision was made if the office of the president became vacant, which occurred four times later. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice-president, without any notion of succeeding in the presidency. One acting president, George Bryan, was subsequently recognized later as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months.

===Governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===
The 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms, with no lifetime limit.

Under the 1968 constitution, Milton Shapp was the first governor to serve two terms, and Tom Corbett was the first incumbent governor to lose a re-election bid.

If the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the state senate becomes governor. The position of a lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become the sitting governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once before, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same political party ticket.

<text>The governor of Rhode Island is the head of government of Rhode Island and serves as commander-in-chief of the U.S. state&#x27;s Army National Guard and Air National Guard. The current governor is Dan McKee. 

==Governors==

Rhode Island was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on May 29, 1790. Before it declared its independence, Rhode Island was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. 

The state initially continued operating under the provisions of its 1663 charter, which simply said that the governor and deputy-governor would be elected from time to time. The 1842 constitution formalized the terms for governor and lieutenant governor to be one year, beginning on the first Tuesday of May after the election. Amendment XVI, taking effect in 1911, changed the term to be two years beginning from the first Tuesday in the January after the election. Terms were lengthened to four years in 1992, but governors were now limited to succeeding themselves only once. A former governor can run again after a four year break. Should the office of governor be vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

<doc id="252790" wikidata="Q888821" url="?curid=252790" title="List of governors of American Samoa">
<text>This is a list of governors, etc. of the part of the Samoan Islands (now comprising American Samoa) under United States administration since 1900.

From 1900 to 1978 governors were appointed by the Federal government of the United States. Since that time they have been elected for 4-year terms by the people of American Samoa.

==History==
When the Department of the Interior sent four governors in a three-year period, local Samoans began advocating for choosing their own governors. In the late 1940s, a Navy Governor, as well as an Interior Governor, had expressed their beliefs that High Orator Chief Tuiasosopo would be a suitable governor. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Peter Tali Coleman as Governor of American Samoa, the first person of Samoan descent to occupy that role. Coleman, a member of the Republican Party, was a U.S. Army officer with a law degree from Georgetown University. After his presidential appointment, local residents became increasingly aware that Samoans can do the job just as good as the federal government, which until now had appointed governors to the islands. Soon local lawmakers such as Governor Owen Aspinall and H. Rex Lee favored the idea of locals being elected governors. On the other side was Governor John Morse Haydon, who openly opposed the idea. An administrative judge criticized Haydon and following a Pago Pago hearing, the Department of the Interior began distancing itself from Haydon and soon replaced him with a new governor. The concept of an &quot;elected&quot; governor was proposed with Senate Bill 20 and a Gubernatorial Commission was created in order to consider ways to implement the concept of electing governors.

In a 1977 article from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, it describes how opposition to an appointed Governor began with the appointment of Earl B. Ruth. Within eighteen months, the congressman from North Carolina had removed several Samoans in administrative posts, who had been appointed by former Governor John Morse Haydon. Governor Ruth was soon recalled to Washington, DC and was later quoted for having called Samoans &quot;lazy, thieving liars.&quot; After having turned down the proposal to elect their own Governor in three plebiscites, American Samoans in a 1976 referendum overwhelmingly approved the measure in which allowed them to elect that official. The first popularly elected Governor was Peter Tali Coleman that same year.

Te&#x27;o J. Fuavai was one of the earliest proponents of the movement to elect Governors in American Samoa, as opposed to Governors being appointed by the federal government. Fuavai sponsored a resolution that proposed the Department of the Interior to permit elections.

<doc id="252793" wikidata="Q4862171" url="?curid=252793" title="Amstrad CPC 464">
<text>The CPC 464 is the first personal home computer built by Amstrad. Released in 1984, it was the first entry in the Amstrad CPC family of home computers. The CPC 464 was one of the bestselling and best produced microcomputers, with more than 2 million units sold in Europe. The British home computer boom had already peaked before Amstrad announced the CPC 464 (which stood for Colour Personal Computer) which they then released a mere nine months later.

Amstrad was known for cheap hi-fi products but had not broken into the home computer market until the CPC 464. Their consumer electronic sales were starting to plateau and owner and founder Alan Sugar stated &quot;We needed to move on and find another sector or product to bring us back to profit growth&quot;. Work started on the Amstrad home computer in 1983 with engineer Ivor Spital who concluded that Amstrad should enter the home computer market, offering a product that integrated low-cost hardware to be sold at an affordable &quot;impulse-purchase price&quot;.

Spital wanted to offer a device that would not commandeer the family TV but instead be an all-in-one computer with its own monitor, thus freeing up the TV and allowing others to play video games at the same time.

Bill Poel, General Manager of Amsoft (Amstrad&#x27;s software division), said during the launch press release that if the computers were not on the shelves by the end of June, &quot;I will be prepared to sit down and eat one in Trafalgar Square.&quot;

==Technical specifications==
The CPC 464 is powered by the Zilog Z80 processor after the original attempts to use the 6502 processor, being used in the Apple II amongst many other 8-bit computer families, failed. The Z80 runs at 4 MHz, has 64 KB of memory and runs AMSDOS, Amstrad&#x27;s own OS. The unit includes a built-in tape drive and the choice of a colour or green monochrome monitor.
The graphics, which uses a Motorola 6845 chip for timing and address generation, provides 3 standard display modes, each using colours chosen from a palette of 27.
*Mode 0 - 160×200, 16 colours
*Mode 1 - 320×200, 4 colours
*Mode 2 - 640x200, 2 colours

Its sound is supplied using the General Instrument AY-3-8912 sound chip that provides 3-voice, 8-octave sound capacity through a built-in loudspeaker with volume control. Later versions of the 464 have a headphone jack that can also be used for external speakers.

The CPC 464&#x27;s code name during development was &#x27;Arnold&#x27;.

==Reception==
The 464 was popular with consumers for various reasons. Aside from the joystick port, the computer, keyboard, and tape deck were all combined into one unit that attached to the monitor via two cables. The monitor also contained the power supply unit which powered the whole unit via one wall plug. It did not have very many wires and was simple enough for even the most inexperienced user to install.

<text>Döbeln is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Torgau-Oschatz, Riesa-Großenhain, Meißen, Mittweida and Muldentalkreis.

== History ==

The region was originally populated by Sorbic peoples. In the early Middle Ages, the Daleminzian people settled along this section of the Mulde River. They were driven away by Germans after the Battle of Jahna in 928.

The present borders of the district were established in 1952, when the government of East Germany formed the new districts. Döbeln was one of the few districts which had not been changed directly after the German reunification. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Döbeln, Freiberg and Mittweida were merged into the new district Mittelsachsen.

== Geography ==

The district was located on the banks of the Freiberger Mulde in the triangle between the cities of Dresden, Leipzig and Chemnitz.
