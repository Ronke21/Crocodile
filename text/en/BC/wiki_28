<text>The music of [[Hawaii]] includes an array of traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop. Styles like slack-key guitar are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar. In addition, the music which began to be played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii in the early 1900s is called cachi cachi music, on the islands of Hawaii.

The traditional music of Hawaii&#x27;s Native Hawaiian community is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music. Hawaiian music has had a notable impact on the music of other Polynesian islands; Peter Manuel called the influence of Hawaiian music a &quot;unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics&quot;.

== Music festivals and venues ==
Major music festivals in Hawaii include the Merrie Monarch Hula Festival, which brings together hula groups from across the world, as well as a number of slack-key and steel guitar festivals: Big Island Slack Key Guitar Festival, Steel Guitar Association Festival and the Gabby Pahinui/Atta Isaacs Slack Key Festival. April&#x27;s Aloha Week is a popular tourist attraction, as is the Moloka&#x27;i Music Festival held around Labor Day. There was also a Hawaii International Jazz Festival, which ran from 1993 until 2007. The annual Pacific Rim Jazz Festival occurs in mid-autumn at the Hawaii Convention Center. The annual Manoa Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival takes place in early autumn at the Andrews Amphitheatre on the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa campus.

Hawaii is home to numerous hotels, many of which feature music in the afternoon or evening; some of the more prominent ones include the Kahala Hilton, the Sheraton Moana Hotel, the Sheraton Waikiki, the Halekulani, Casanova&#x27;s and the King Kamehameha Hotel. Large music venues in Hawaii include the University of Hawaii at Hilo Performing Arts Center, which has 600 seats and is the largest venue on the Big Island. A 560-seat venue and cultural exhibition center on Kauai is the Kauai Community College Performing Arts Center. In Honolulu, the Neal S. Blaisdell Center Arena, Concert Hall, and Exhibition Hall are three of the largest venues in the state. Other venues for Hawaiian music on Oahu include the Waikiki Shell, an establishment used primarily for concerts and entertainment purposes. Over the years many local, as well as international artists, have graced the stage there. It is a unique outdoor theater located in Kapiolani Park. This venue seats 2,400 persons, with the capacity to hold up to 6,000 more on the lawn area. Concerts, graduation ceremonies, and hula shows are very popular at this site, as well as Kennedy Theatre and Andrews Amphitheatre on the campus of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, the Blaisdell Center Concert Hall, the Hawaii Theatre in downtown Honolulu, the Red Elephant (a performance space and recording studio in downtown Honolulu), Paliku Theatre on the campus of Windward Community College, and the Leeward Community College Theatre. The historic Lanai Theatre is a cultural landmark on Lanai, dating back to the 1930s.

== Music institutions and industry ==
Hawaii is home to a number of renowned music institutions in several fields. The Honolulu Symphony Orchestra is an important part of the state&#x27;s musical history, and is the oldest orchestra in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, founded in 1900. The Orchestra has collaborated with other local institutions, like the Hawaii Opera Theatre and the Oʻahu Choral Society, which sponsors the Honolulu Symphony Chorus and the Honolulu Chamber Choir.

Numerous businesses have been created supporting the special musical styles and instruments suited to the Hawaiian musical tradition. The Guitar and Lute Workshop was an early manufacturer and proponent of specialty slack-key guitars in the early 1970s, and the Kamaka Ukulele company was established as key manufacturer of ukuleles for Hawaiian musical acts.

== Folk music ==
Hawaiian folk music includes several varieties of chanting (&quot;mele&quot;) and music meant for highly ritualized dance (&quot;hula&quot;). Traditional Hawaiian music and dance was functional, used to express praise, communicate genealogy and mythology, and accompany games, festivals and other secular events. The Hawaiian language has no word that translates precisely as &quot;music&quot;, but a diverse vocabulary exists to describe rhythms, instruments, styles and elements of voice production. Hawaiian folk music is simple in melody and rhythm, but is &quot;complex and rich&quot; in the &quot;poetry, accompanying mimetic dance (&quot;hula&quot;), and subtleties of vocal styles... even in the attenuated forms in which they survive today&quot;.

The chant (&quot;mele&quot;) is typically accompanied by an &quot;ipu heke&quot; (a double gourd) and/or &quot;pahu&quot; (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an &quot;ipu&quot; (single gourd), &quot;iliili&quot; (waterworn lava stone castanets),&quot;uliuli&quot; (feathered gourd rattles), &quot;pu`ili&quot; (split bamboo sticks), or &quot;kalaau&quot; (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called &quot;kahiko&quot;, while the modern version is &quot;auana&quot;. There are also religious chants called &quot;oli&quot;; when accompanied by dancing and drums, it is called &quot;mele hula pahu&quot;.

In the pre-contact Hawaiian language, the word &quot;mele&quot; referred to any kind of poetic expression, though it now translates as &quot;song&quot;. The two kinds of Hawaiian chanting were &quot;mele oli&quot; and &quot;mele hula&quot;. The first were a cappella individual songs, while the latter were accompanied dance music performed by a group. The chanters were known as &quot;haku mele&quot; and were highly trained composers and performers. Some kinds of chants express emotions like angst and affection, or request a favor from another person. Other chants are for specific purposes like naming, (&quot;mele inoa&quot;), prayer (&quot;mele pule&quot;), surfing (&quot;mele he&#x27;e nalu&quot;), and genealogical recitations (&quot;mele koihonua&quot;). Mele chants were governed by strict rules, and were performed in a number of styles include the rapid &quot;kepakepa&quot; and the enunciate &quot;koihonua&quot;.

== Music history ==

Historical documentation of Hawaiian music does not extend prior to the late 18th century, when non-Hawaiians (&quot;haoles&quot;) arrived on the island. From 1778 onward, Hawaii began a period of acculturation with the introduction of numerous styles of European music, including the hymns (&quot;himeni&quot;) introduced by Protestant missionary choirs. Spanish-speaking Mexican cowboys (&quot;paniolos&quot;), were particularly influential immigrants in the field of music, introducing string instruments such as the guitar and possibly also the technique of falsetto singing, while Portuguese immigrants brought the ukulele-like braguinha. also immigrants from all over the world had brought their own instruments along with them to the islands.

Elizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian music history into seven periods, beginning with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted to the beginning of the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar&#x27;s third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of &quot;hapa haole&quot; songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the Victor Talking Machine Company made the first 53 recordings in the territory. By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico&#x27;s sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as Cachi Cachi music, on the islands of Hawaii.

From 1915 to 1930, mainstream audiences outside of Hawaii became increasingly enamored of Hawaiian music, though by this time the songs marketed as &quot;Hawaiian&quot; had only peripheral aspects of actual Hawaiian music. Tahitian and Samoan music had an influence on Hawaiian music during this period, especially in their swifter and more intricate rhythms. The following era, from about 1930 to 1960, has been called the &quot;Golden Age of Hawaiian music&quot;. National radio host Webley Edwards, broadcasting from Honolulu, first introduced most Americans to authentic and adapted for orchestra and big band styles through his popular hour-long radio show Hawaii Calls. Hawaiian performers like Lani McIntire, John Kameaaloha Almeida and Sol Hoʻopiʻi became mainstream stars as regulars on the show and through live performances. In the 1960s, Hawaiian-style music declined in popularity amid an influx of rock, soul and pop acts from the American mainland. This trend reversed itself in the final period of Hawaiian music history, the modern period beginning with the Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s and continuing with the foundation of a variety of modern music scenes in fields like indie rock, Hawaiian Rap (Na mele paleoleo) and Jawaiian.

=== Liliʻuokalani and Henri Berger ===
Queen Liliʻuokalani was the last Queen of Hawaii before the Hawaiian monarchy was illegally overthrown by white American plantation owners . She was also a musician and prolific composer who wrote many musical works. She was best known for &quot;Aloha &#x27;Oe&quot;. A compilation of her works, titled &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Songbook&quot;, was published in 1999 by The Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani Trust.

Lili&#x27;uokalani was one of many members of the Hawaiian royal family with musical inclinations. They studied under a Prussian military bandleader, Henri Berger, who was sent by the Kaiser at the request of Kamehameha V. Berger became fascinated by Hawaiian folk music, and wrote much documentation on it. However, he also brought his own musical background in German music, and heavily guided the Hawaiian musicians and composers he worked with.

King Kamehameha V also, in 1847, sent to Germany for a &quot;band Leader&quot; for &quot;The Kings Own Band&quot;, now the Royal Hawaiian Band, William Mersberg, from Weimar, Germany. He is Henry Kaleialoha Allen&#x27;s great grandfather. Henry Kaleialoha Allen is &quot;one of Hawaii&#x27;s Living Treasures of Hawaiian Music&quot; and a master music educator and has been honored many times on the Senate Floor and by the Legislature for such.

=== Guitar innovations ===
Guitars could have come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or travelers to and from California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (&quot;vaqueros&quot;) brought by King Kamehameha III in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of cattle. The Hawaiian cowboys (&quot;paniolo&quot;) used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the &quot;braguinha&quot;, a small, four-stringed Madeira variant of the cavaquinho; this instrument was a precursor to the `ukulele.

Steel-string guitars also arrived with the Portuguese in the 1860s and slack-key had spread across the chain by the late 1880s. A ship called the &quot;Ravenscrag&quot; arrived in Honolulu on August 23, 1879, bringing Portuguese field workers from Madeira. Legend has it that one of the men, João Fernandes, later a popular musician, tried to impress the Hawaiians by playing folk music with a friend&#x27;s braguinha; it is also said that the Hawaiians called the instrument &quot;`ukulele&quot; (&quot;jumping flea&quot;) in reference to the man&#x27;s swift fingers. Others have claimed the word means &quot;gift that came here&quot; or a corruption of &quot;ukeke lele&quot; (&quot;dancing ukeke&quot;, a three-string bow).

The popularity throughout the 1920s of Hawaiian music, with its unique slide-style of guitar playing, prompted the invention of the electric guitar in 1931, as a lap steel guitar, the &quot;frying pan&quot;, by George Beauchamp. Electric amplification allowed the Hawaiian-style guitar to be heard in performances of larger popular bands.

=== Late 19th and early 20th century ===
In the 1880s and 90s, King David Kalakaua promoted Hawaiian culture and also encouraged the addition of new instruments, such as the ukulele and possibly steel guitar; Kalakaua died in 1891, and so it is highly unlikely he would have heard it. Kalakaua&#x27;s successor, his sister Lili&#x27;uokalani, was also a prolific composer and wrote several songs, like &quot;Aloha &#x27;Oe&quot;, which remain popular. During this period, Hawaiian music evolved into a &quot;new distinctive&quot; style, using the derivatives of European instruments; aside from the widespread string instruments, brass bands like the Royal Hawaiian Band performed Hawaiian songs as well as popular marches and ragtimes.

In about 1889, Joseph Kekuku began sliding a piece of steel across the strings of a guitar, thus inventing steel guitar (&quot;kika kila&quot;); at about the same time, traditional Hawaiian music with English lyrics became popular. Vocals predominated in Hawaiian music until the 20th century, when instrumentation took a lead role. Much of modern slack-key guitar has become entirely instrumental.

From about 1895 to 1915, Hawaiian music dance bands became in demand more and more. These were typically string quintets. Ragtime music influenced the music, and English words were commonly used in the lyrics. This type of Hawaiian music, influenced by popular music and with lyrics being a combination of English and Hawaiian (or wholly English), is called hapa haole (literally: half white) music. In 1903, Albert &quot;Sonny&quot; Cunha composed &quot;My Waikiki Mermaid&quot;, arguably the first popular hapa haole song (The earliest known hapa haole song, &quot;Eating of the Poi&quot;, was published in &quot;Ka Buke o na Leo Mele Hawaii...o na Home Hawaii&quot; in Honolulu in 1888 [See Kanahele, George S., &quot;Hawaiian Music and Musicians&quot; pp 71–72]).

In 1927, Rose Moe (1908–1999), a Hawaiian singer, with her husband Tau Moe (1908–2004), a Samoan guitarist, began touring with &quot;Madame Riviere&#x27;s Hawaiians&quot;. In 1929 they recorded eight songs in Tokyo. Rose and Tau continued touring for over fifty years, living in countries such as Germany, Lebanon and India. They even performed in Germany as late as 1938 when the Nazi racism was on the rise and people of a darker color were regarded as inferior people; it is said that they even performed for Adolf Hitler himself. With their children, the Tau Moe family did much to spread the sound of Hawaiian folk music and hapa haole music throughout the world. In 1988, the Tau Moe family re-recorded the 1929 sessions with the help of musician and ethnomusicologist Bob Brozman.

The 1920s also saw the development of a uniquely Hawaiian style of jazz, innovated by performers at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian Hotels.

====Slack key guitar====

Slack-key guitar (&quot;kī ho`alu&quot; in Hawaiian) is a fingerpicked playing style, named for the fact that the strings are most often &quot;slacked&quot; or loosened to create an open (unfingered) chord, either a major chord (the most common is G, which is called &quot;taro patch&quot; tuning) or a major 7th (called a &quot;wahine&quot; tuning). A tuning might be invented to play a particular song or facilitate a particular effect, and as late as the 1960s they were often treated as family secrets and passed from generation to generation. By the time of the Hawaiian Renaissance, though, the example of players such as Auntie Alice Namakelua, Leonard Kwan, Raymond Kane, and Keola Beamer had encouraged the sharing of the tunings and techniques and probably saved the style from extinction. Playing techniques include &quot;hammering-on&quot;, &quot;pulling-off&quot;, &quot;chimes&quot; (harmonics), and &quot;slides,&quot; and these effects frequently mimic the falsettos and vocal breaks common in Hawaiian singing.

The guitar entered Hawaiian culture from a number of directions—sailors, settlers, and contract workers. One important source of the style was Mexican cowboys hired to work on the Big Island of Hawaii in the first half of the 19th century. These paniolo brought their guitars and their music, and when they left, the Hawaiians developed their own style of playing the instrument.

Slack key guitar evolved to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the melodies of Hawaiian chant. Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of King David Kalakaua as a matter of national pride and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).

==== Popularization ====

In the early 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. A Broadway show called &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; introduced Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco followed in 1915; one year later, recordings of indigenous Hawaiian music outsold all other U.S. musical genres.

The increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced blues and country musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like Bennie Nawahi began incorporating jazz into his steel guitar, ukulele, and mandolin music, while the Kalama Quartet introduced a style of group falsetto singing.

The musician Sol Hoʻopiʻi arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the Nashville sound of popular country music. Lani McIntire was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with Jimmie Rodgers and Bing Crosby.

In the 1920s and 30s, Hawaiian music became an integral part of local tourism, with most hotels and attractions incorporating music in one form or another. Among the earliest and most popular musical attractions was the &quot;Kodak Hula Show&quot;, sponsored by Kodak, in which a tourist purchased Kodak film and took photographs of dancers and musicians. The show ran from 1937 through 2002. Several vinyl LPs featuring music from the Kodak Hula Show were released by Waikiki Records, with full color photographs of the show&#x27;s performers.

In the first half of the 20th century, the mostly young men who hung around the Honolulu beaches, swimming and surfing, came to be known as the Waikiki Beachboys and their parties became famous across Hawaii and abroad; most of them played the ukulele all day long, sitting on the beach, and eventually began working for hotels to entertain tourists.

Popular Hawaiian music with English verse (hapa haole) can be described in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.

The Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 introduced Hawaiian steel guitar to mainland country music artists, and by the 1930s country stars Hoot Gibson and Jimmy Davis were making records with Hawaiian musicians.

The influx of thousands of American servicemen into Hawaii during World War II created a demand for both popular swing rhythm and country sounds. The western swing style, popular on the mainland since the 1930s, employed the steel guitar as a key element and was therefore a natural evolution. Beginning in 1945, the Bell Record Company of Honolulu responded to the demand with a series of releases by the western swing band Fiddling Sam and his Hawaiian Buckaroos (led by fiddler Homer H. Spivey, and including Lloyd C. Moore, Tiny Barton, Al Hittle, Calvert Duke, Tolbert E. Stinnett, and Raymond &quot;Blackie&quot; Barnes). Between 1945 and 1950 Bell released some 40 sides by the Hawaiian Buckaroos, including a set of square dance numbers.

=== Kamehameha Schools Song Contest ===
The Kamehameha Schools Song Contest, a well-known tradition within Hawaiʻi, is held by Kamehameha Schools Kapālama annually in the Spring, typically mid-March, at the Neal Blaisdell Center. It is a musical competition between high school classes and every year, during the third semester, students prepare and rehearse to perform these different a cappella choral arrangements of mele (Hawaiian songs) as a class. Every year the theme changes, for example, in 2023 the theme was Na Mele Paniolo, songs and Hoʻike (half-time hula and music exhibition) were about the songs of the Hawaiian cowboy. According to the Director of Music at Kamehameha from 1926-1947, Miss Laura Brown, &quot;the objectives of the song contest are to build up the repertoire of the best in Hawaiian music for the cultural heritage of any student who attends Kamehameha; to develop leadership, cooperation and good class spirit; and to give students the use of their singing voices and to give them pleasure in singing as a means of expression&quot;. Song contest is a way to celebrate and showcase Hawaiian music and Hawaiian culture with people from all around the world.

The entire program length is around two-two and a half hours, and consists of the oli hoʻokipa (opening chant), pule (prayer), singing Hoʻonani Ka Makua Mau (Doxology), singing Hawaiʻi Ponoʻi (The Hawaiʻi National Anthem), the main program with 10 songs sung by classes singing their co-ed, men, and women songs, Hōʻike (hula half-time exhibition performance), results and awards being presented (Ka Hāʻawi Makana), and ending with the alma mater (Sonʻs of Hawaiʻi).
Kamehameha Schools Song Contest is also very famous for the intermission Hōʻike performance. It is a half-time performance celebrating Hawaiian music and hula, and relates to the theme for that year. The performance also features live Hawaiian music, props, and many special guests, narration from students, and hula ʻauana (modern-style hula) and hula kahiko (traditional-style hula).

== Modern music ==
In recent decades, traditional Hawaiian music has undergone a renaissance, with renewed interest from both ethnic Hawaiians and others. The islands have also produced a number of well-regarded rock, pop, hip hop (na mele paleoleo), dubstep, soul, and reggae performers, and many local musicians in the clubs of Waikiki and Honolulu play outside the various &quot;Hawaiian&quot; genres. Hawaii has its own regional music industry, with several distinctive styles of recorded popular music. Hawaiian popular music is largely based on American popular music, but does have distinctive retentions from traditional Hawaiian music.

=== Hawaiian Renaissance ===

The Hawaiian Renaissance was a resurgence in interest in Hawaiian music, especially slack-key, among ethnic Hawaiians. Long-standing performers like Gabby Pahinui found their careers revitalized; Pahinui, who had begun recording in 1947, finally reached mainstream audiences across the United States when sessions on which Ry Cooder played with him and his family were released as &quot;The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band, Vol. 1&quot; on a major mainland label. Pahinui inspired a legion of followers who played a mix of slack-key, reggae, country, rock, and other styles. The more traditional players included Leland &quot;Atta&quot; Isaacs, Sr., Sonny Chillingworth, Ray Kane, Leonard Kwan, Ledward Ka`apana, Dennis Pavao, while Keola Beamer, and Peter Moon have been more eclectic in their approach. The Emerson brothers rekindled the classic sound of Sol Ho&#x27;opi&#x27;i with the National steel guitar on their vintage 1920s stylings. George Kanahele&#x27;s Hawaiian National Music Foundation did much to spread slack-key and other forms of Hawaiian music, especially after a major 1972 concert.

Don Ho (1930–2007), originally from the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kaka&#x27;ako, was the most widely known Hawaiian entertainer of the last decades of the 20th century. Although he did not play &quot;traditional&quot; Hawaiian music, Ho became an unofficial ambassador of Hawaiian culture throughout the world as well as on the American mainland. Ho&#x27;s style often combined traditional Hawaiian elements and older 1950s and 1960s-style crooner music with an easy listening touch.

Loyal Garner also embraced Hawaiian elements in her Vegas-style lounge act and in the songs she recorded. A third notable performer, Myra English, became known as the &quot;Champagne Lady&quot; after recording the song &quot;Drinking Champagne&quot; by Bill Mack in 1963 became her signature song in Hawaii, and she achieved considerable commercial success both locally and abroad.

=== Jawaiian ===

Jawaiian is a Hawaiian style of reggae music. Reggae music is a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and earlier in Jamaica. It has become popular across the world, especially among ethnic groups and races that have been historically oppressed, such as Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Australian Aborigines. In Hawaii, ethnic Hawaiians and others in the state began playing a mixture of reggae and local music in the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that it became recognized as a new genre in local music. The band Simplisity has been credited by Quiet Storm Records as originators of the Jawaiian style, while other influences include Walter Aipolani, known as the Father of Hawaiian Reggae. By the end of the 1980s, Jawaiian came to dominate the local music scene, as well as spawning a backlash that the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; compared to the &quot;disco sucks&quot; movement of the late 1970s.

Reggae culture as a whole began to dominate Hawaii, as many locals can be seen sporting Bob Marley memorabilia, and much local merchandise and souvenirs have been emblazoned with the red, yellow, and green colors of the Hawaiian sovereignty as well as the Lion of Judah flag, a known symbol of the Rastafari movement. The Rasta colors have also become a symbol of local pride.

=== Rock and roll ===

Rock and roll music has long been popular in Hawaii - numerous rock and roll artists spent their developmental years in Hawaii (i.e. members of The Association, The Electric Prunes, 7th Order, Vicious Rumors, as well as guitarists Marty Friedman and Charlie &quot;Icarus&quot; Johnson), and its local popularity dates back to the earliest days of rock music. Elvis Presley&#x27;s career included several Hawaii-related performances and records: a March 1961 live performance to raise money for the construction of the USS Arizona Memorial at the Pearl Harbor Bloch Arena in March 1961, his &quot;Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite&quot; &quot;comeback&quot; record and concert in 1973, and three of his movies were based in Hawaii (&quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot;, and &quot;Paradise, Hawaiian Style&quot;).

Through the 1960s and 1970s, rock concerts were frequently held at venues like the Honolulu International Center and The Waikiki Shell by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, Jeff Beck, and many other top rock artists.

The three-day-long Crater Festivals (held over the New Years and July 4 holidays) at Diamond Head in the 1960s and 1970s were well attended through the era, and frequently featured popular bands like Fleetwood Mac, Journey and Santana (Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles actually released their 1972 Crater Festival performance on the LP &quot;Carlos Santana &amp; Buddy Miles! Live!&quot;).

=== Jazz ===
====Musicians====
Some notable current and retired jazz musicians in Hawaii include Gabe Baltazar (saxophone), Martin Denny (piano), Arthur Lyman (vibraphone and marimba), Henry Allen (guitar), vonBaron (drums), David Choy (saxophone), Rich Crandall (piano), Dan Del Negro (keyboards), Pierre Grill (piano/keyboards/trombone), Bruce Hamada (bass), DeShannon Higa (trumpet), Jim Howard (piano), Steve Jones (bass), John Kolivas (bass), Noel Okimoto (drums/percussion/vibes), Michael Paulo (reeds), Rene Paulo (acoustic grand piano) was a forerunner of recording Hawaiian music in the jazz venue in the early 1960s and is one of Hawaii&#x27;s legendary music greats, Robert Shinoda (guitar), Arex Ikehara (bass), Phil Bennett (drums), Aron Nelson (piano), Tennyson Stephens (piano), Dean Taba (bass), Betty Loo Taylor (piano), Tim Tsukiyama (saxophone), Reggie Padilla (saxophone), and Abe Lagrimas Jr. (drums/ukulele/vibes).

Notable jazz vocalists in Hawaii, both current and retired include Jimmy Borges, Rachel Gonzales, Azure McCall, Dana Land, Joy Woode, and I. Mihana Souza. Although Hawaiian vocalist Melveen Leed is known primarily for singing Hawaiian and &quot;Hawaiian country&quot; music, she has also earned good reviews as a jazz singer.

There are frequent performances by the University of Hawaii jazz bands.

=== Ukulele ===

The ukulele was introduced to Hawaii by Madeiran immigrants near the close of the 19th century. Portuguese immigrants traveled to the Hawaiian Islands and brought parts of their culture with them, including a small guitar-like instrument, known as the braguinha in Portugal today, and also &quot;machete de braga&quot; (small guitar from Braga). The pioneers of the ukulele were Augusto Dias, Manuel Nunes, and José do Espírito Santo. They were aboard the Ravenscrag ship under a contract to help out with labor upon the sugar plantations spread throughout the Hawaiian Islands at the time. However, growing up in Madeira, they were trained as cabinet workers and soon opened up their own company and guitar shop around 1884–1885.

With Madeira being far in location, they soon began using local resources including the Hawaiian wood, Koa, to create their instruments. Koa wood is one of the higher-quality woods which creates a deep and also clear sound for the ukulele. This makes Koa ukuleles very distinguishable by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an ukulele. Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound but also by looks. They have a unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood.

The instrument became very popular in Hawaiian culture as it was the first introduction to a melodic instrument. A majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele and many have begun playing the instrument from around the world. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means &quot;flea (uku) jumping (lele).&quot; It was named in reference to the movement of players&#x27; fingers, acting as fleas jumping to and from different frets and strings. There are currently four sizes of ukulele; soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.

Queen Liliʻuokalani, the last Hawaiian Queen, believed that the name for the ukulele means &quot;The gift that came here&quot;. She believed this because of the Hawaiian words &quot;uku&quot; which means &quot;gift or reward&quot; and &quot;lele&quot; which means &quot;to come.&quot; The instrument was very popular among the Royal Hawaiian family, with Queen Liliʻuokalani, King Kalākaua, and Princess Kaʻiulani being some of the members who played the instrument. Also with Koa being closely related and representative of the Royal Hawaiian Family, and Koa being what ukuleles are made of, Ukulele was highly valued within Hawaiian culture and practices as it also carried the imprint and association with the Royal Family. It is also known that King Kalākaua was an integral part of popularizing the instrument. He was known for composing and playing his ʻukulele, which made it grow in popularity and became almost a trend in those days. It was also seen to be a perfect accompaniment to hula and chanting that percussion implements could not perform.

The instrument came at a time of great turmoil for Native Hawaiians. With the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and an installed provisional government, the instrument was a valuable instrument used for protesting; a famous example is Kaulana Nā Pua (Famous are the Flowers) by Ellen Kehoʻohiwaokalani Wright Prendergast. There is also not only great versatility within the instrument itself but it also is an authentic representation of the Hawaiian people in terms of music written.

The ukulele can be played with simple or elaborate strums, as well as fingerpicking.

=== ‘Ūkēkē ===
The Ukeke is a Hawaiian musical bow played with the mouth. It is the only stringed instrument indigenous to Hawaii.

===&#x27;Ohe hano ihu===
The &quot;&#x27;ohe hano ihu,&quot; (Hawaiian: `ohe = bamboo +hano = breath + ihu = nose) or Traditional Hawaiian Nose Flute in English, is another type of Hawaiian instrument that has cultural and musical importance. It is made from a single bamboo section. According to &quot;Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i&quot; by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the Bishop Museum collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10 to 21 inches (250–530 mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player.

Though primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.

Into the 19th and early 20th centuries, young men still used the &#x27;ohe hano ihu as a way to win the affection and love of a woman. Today, the `ohe hano ihu is enjoying a resurgence of popularity.

Two different oral traditions explain the use of the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person&#x27;s&quot; hā&quot;, breath, is expressive of the person&#x27;s inner being. As the hā travels from the &quot;na`ao&quot;, or gut, through the mouth, the hā can be used to lie. When the hā travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.

Modern folklore says that the Hawaiian flute expresses &quot;aloha&quot; because to hear the flute one must come close to the &quot;alo&quot;, &quot;face&quot; or &quot;presence&quot; of the player to hear the &quot;hā&quot;, &quot;divine breath&quot; and so the listener experiences &quot;being in one another&#x27;s presence sharing the divine breath.&quot; While useful as a way to remember the contemplative and personal nature of the traditional Hawaiian flute, there is no actual etymological evidence, nor is there evidence in traditional chants or stories, to support this etymology. In the Hawaiian language, &quot;hā&quot;, breath, is unrelated to the word &quot;ha&quot;, a causative prefix. a search of cognate words in related languages also reveals no such etymologies for the word &quot;aloha&quot;.

According to the book &quot;`Ohe&quot;, by Leilehua Yuen, the instrument was popularized in the 1970s by members of the Beamer family who played it during performances on tour in North America, as well as in the Hawaiian Islands. Segments of the children&#x27;s educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing `ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer&#x27;s mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the `ohe hano ihu in hula. Her hānai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society.

Notable late 20th Century and early 21st Century musicians of the`ohe hano ihu include Mahi Beamer, Nona Beamer, Keola Beamer, Kapono Beamer, Calvin Hoe, Nelson Kaai, Anthony Natividad, and Manu Josiah.

* Indie blog, 2008: &quot;Country music musicians were drawn to Hawaiian music when they first heard the Hawaiian steel guitar at the San Francisco Pan Pacific Exposition in 1915. Soon, artists such as Hoot Gibson and Jimmie Davis were recording with Hawaiians. Hawaii&#x27;s love affair with country music dates back to World War II, the result of the influx of great numbers of military personnel from the mainland USA. Local record labels scrambled to release &quot;hillbilly music&quot; to satisfy the new interest. Bell Records released recordings in 1945 by Fiddling Sam &amp; his Hawaiian Buckaroos.

<doc id="244167" wikidata="Q4150820" url="?curid=244167" title="Communal reinforcement">
<text>Communal reinforcement is a social phenomenon in which a concept or idea is repeatedly asserted in a community, regardless of whether sufficient empirical evidence has been presented to support it. Over time, the concept or idea is reinforced to become a strong belief in many people&#x27;s minds, and may be regarded by the members of the community as fact. Often, the concept or idea may be further reinforced by publications in the mass media, books, or other means of communication. The phrase &quot;millions of people can&#x27;t all be wrong&quot; is indicative of the common tendency to accept a communally reinforced idea without question, which often aids in the widespread acceptance of factoids. A very similar term to this term is community-reinforcement, which is a behavioral method to stop drug addiction.

==In addiction treatment==
The community-reinforcement approach (CRA) is a behaviourist alcoholism treatment approach that aims to achieve abstinence by eliminating positive reinforcement for drinking and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. CRA integrates several treatment components, including building the client&#x27;s motivation to quit drinking, helping the client initiate sobriety, analyzing the client&#x27;s drinking pattern, increasing positive reinforcement, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process. These components can be adjusted to the individual client&#x27;s needs to achieve optimal treatment outcome. In addition, treatment outcome can be influenced by factors such as therapist style and initial treatment intensity. Several studies have provided evidence for CRA&#x27;s effectiveness in achieving abstinence. Furthermore, CRA has been successfully integrated with a variety of other treatment approaches, such as family therapy and motivational interviewing, and has been tested in the treatment of other drug abuse. Community reinforcement and family training (CRAFT) is an adaptation of CRA that is aimed at giving the Concerned Significant Others (CSOs) of alcoholics skills to help them get the alcoholic into treatment.

==In other applications==
In Chris E. Stout&#x27;s book &quot;The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspective&quot;, Stout explains how community reinforcement is present in the psychotic state of terrorists. &quot;The individual would feel less charged, validated, courageous, sanctified, and zealous, and would feel exposed as an individual.&quot; It is believed that the group mentality of a terrorist organization solidifies the mission of the group through communal reinforcement. Members are more likely to stay dedicated and follow through with the event of terror if they receive support from fellow terrorist members. An individual might abandon the mission in terror, but with the reinforcement of his peers, a member is more likely to stay involved.

<doc id="244180" wikidata="Q316817" url="?curid=244180" title="1973 oil crisis">
<text>In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) announced that it was implementing a total oil embargo against countries that had supported Israel at any point during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which began after Egypt and Syria launched a large-scale surprise attack in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to recover the territories that they had lost to Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. In an effort that was led by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the initial countries that OAPEC targeted were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This list was later expanded to include Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. In March 1974, OAPEC lifted the embargo, but the price of oil had risen by nearly 300%: from US to nearly US globally. Prices in the United States were significantly higher than the global average. After it was implemented, the embargo caused an oil crisis, or &quot;shock&quot;, with many short- and long-term effects on the global economy as well as on global politics. The 1973 embargo later came to be referred to as the &quot;first oil shock&quot; vis-à-vis the &quot;second oil shock&quot; that was the 1979 oil crisis, brought upon by the Iranian Revolution.
==Background==

===Arab-Israeli conflict===
Ever since Israel declared independence in 1948 there was conflict between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, including several wars. The Suez Crisis, also known as the Second Arab–Israeli war, was sparked by Israel&#x27;s southern port of Eilat being blocked by Egypt, which also nationalized the Suez Canal belonging to French and British investors. As a result of the war, the Suez Canal was closed for several months between 1956 and 1957.

The Six-Day War of 1967 included an Israeli invasion of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, which resulted in Egypt closing the Suez Canal for eight years. Following the Yom Kippur War, the canal was cleared in 1974 and opened again in 1975. OAPEC countries cut production of oil and placed an embargo on oil exports to the United States after Richard Nixon requested $2.2 billion to support Israel&#x27;s war effort. Nevertheless, the embargo lasted only until January 1974, though the price of oil remained high afterwards.

===American production decline===
By 1969, American domestic output of oil was peaking and could not keep pace with increasing demand from vehicles. The U.S. was importing per year by the late 1950s, mostly from Venezuela and Canada. Because of transportation costs and tariffs, it never purchased much oil from the Middle East. In 1973, US production had declined to 16% of global output. Eisenhower imposed quotas on foreign oil that would stay in place between 1959 and 1973. Critics called it the &quot;drain America first&quot; policy. Some scholars believe the policy contributed to the decline of domestic US oil production in the early 1970s. The cheapness of oil compared with coal led to the decline of the coal industry. In 1951, 51% of America&#x27;s energy came from coal, and by 1973, only 19% of America&#x27;s industry was coal-based.

When Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he assigned George Shultz to head a committee to review the Eisenhower-era quota program. Shultz&#x27;s committee recommended that the quotas be abolished and replaced with tariffs but Nixon decided to keep the quotas due to vigorous political opposition. Nixon imposed a price ceiling on oil in 1971 as demand for oil was increasing and production was declining, which increased dependence on foreign oil imports as consumption was bolstered by low prices. In 1973, Nixon announced the end of the quota system. Between 1970 and 1973 US imports of crude oil had nearly doubled, reaching 6.2 million barrels per day in 1973. Until 1973, an abundance of oil supply had kept the market price of oil lower than the posted price.

In 1970, American oil production peaked and the United States began to import more and more oil as oil imports rose by 52% between 1969 and 1972. By 1972, 83% of the American oil imports came from the Middle East. Throughout the 1960s, the price for a barrel of oil remained at $1.80, meaning that with the effects of inflation considered the price of oil in real terms got progressively lower and lower throughout the decade with Americans paying less for oil in 1969 than they had in 1959. Even after a price for a barrel of oil rose to $2.00 in 1971, adjusted for inflation, people in the Western nations were paying less for oil in 1971 than they had in 1958. The extremely low price of oil served as the basis for the &quot;long summer&quot; of prosperity and mass affluence that began in 1945.

===OPEC===
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was founded by five oil producing countries at a Baghdad conference on September 14, 1960. The five founding members of OPEC were Venezuela, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. OPEC was organized after the oil companies slashed the posted price of oil, but the posted price of oil remained consistently higher than the market price of oil between 1961 and 1972.

In 1963, the Seven Sisters controlled 86% of the oil produced by OPEC countries, but by 1970 the rise of &quot;independent oil companies&quot; had decreased their share to 77%. The entry of three new oil producers—Algeria, Libya and Nigeria—meant that by 1970, 81 oil companies were doing business in the Middle East.

In the early 1960s Libya, Indonesia and Qatar joined OPEC. OPEC was generally regarded as ineffective until political turbulence in Libya and Iraq strengthened their position in 1970. Additionally, increasing Soviet influence provided oil producing countries with alternative means of transporting oil to markets.

Under the Tehran Price Agreement of 1971, signed on February 14, the posted price of oil was increased and, due to a decline in the value of the US dollar relative to gold, certain anti-inflationary measures were enacted.

Because of a severe drain on U.S. gold reserves, leading to higher inflation and lack of confidence in the strength of the dollar, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11615 on August 15, 1971, closing the &quot;gold window&quot;. This action made the dollar inconvertible to gold directly, except on the open market, and was soon dubbed the &quot;Nixon Shock&quot;, leading eventually to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1976. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers&#x27; real income decreased when the dollar started to float free of the old link to gold. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.

After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to former levels in terms of commodities such as gold.

===Countdown to the October War===
Arab oil producing countries had attempted to use oil as leverage to influence political events on two prior occasions—the first was the Suez Crisis in 1956 when the United Kingdom, France and Israel invaded Egypt. During the conflict the Syrians sabotaged both the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and the Iraq–Baniyas pipeline, which disrupted the supply of oil to Western Europe. The second instance was when war broke out between Egypt and Israel in 1967, but despite continued Egyptian and Syrian enmity against Israel, the embargo lasted only a few months. Most scholars agree that the 1967 embargo was ineffective.

Although some members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) supported the use of oil as a weapon to influence the political outcome of the Arab–Israeli conflict, Saudi Arabia had traditionally been the strongest supporter of separating oil from politics. The Saudis were wary of the tactic due to the availability of oil from non-Arab oil producing countries, and in the decades leading up to the crisis, the region&#x27;s conservative monarchies had grown dependent on Western support to ensure their continued survival as Nasserism gained traction. On the other hand, Algeria, Iraq and Libya had strongly supported the use of oil as a weapon in the conflict. Arab newspapers like the Egyptian &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;, Lebanese &quot;An-Nahar&quot; and Iraqi &quot;Al-Thawra&quot; had historically been supportive of the use of oil as a weapon.

In 1970, President Nasser of Egypt died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, a man who believed in the diplomacy of surprise, in engaging in sudden moves to upset the diplomatic equilibrium. Sadat liked to say that his favourite game was backgammon, a game where skill and persistence was rewarded, but was best won by sudden gambles, making an analogy between how he played backgammon and conducted his diplomacy. Under Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had engaged what was known as the Arab Cold War, but Sadat got along very well with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, forming an alliance between the most populous Arab state and the wealthiest Arab state. Unlike the secularist Nasser, Sadat was a pious Muslim and he had a strong personal rapport with King Faisal, who was an equally pious Muslim. The man largely in charge of American foreign policy, the National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. At the same time that Sadat moved closer to Saudi Arabia, he also wanted a rapprochement with the United States and to move Egypt away from its alliance with the Soviet Union. In 1971, the US had information that the Arab states were willing to implement another embargo. In July 1972, Sadat expelled all 16,000 of the Soviet military personnel in Egypt in a signal that he wanted better relations with the United States. Kissinger was taken completely by surprise by Sadat&#x27;s move, saying: &quot;Why has he done me this favor? Why didn&#x27;t he demand all sorts of concessions first?&quot;

Sadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after his anti-Soviet move prompted no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973. For Sadat, cost was no object as the money to buy Soviet arms came from Saudi Arabia. At the same time, Faisal promised Sadat that if it should come to war, Saudi Arabia would embargo oil to the West. In April 1973, the Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani visited Washington to meet Kissinger and told him that King Faisal was becoming more and more unhappy with the United States, saying he wanted America to pressure Israel to return all the lands captured in the Six Day War of 1967.

In a later interview, Yamani accused Kissinger of not taking his warning seriously, saying all he did was to ask him not to speak anymore of this threat. Angry at Kissinger, Yamani in an interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; on April 19, 1973, warned that King Faisal was considering an oil embargo. At the time, the general feeling in Washington was the Saudis were bluffing and nothing would come of their threat to impose an oil embargo. The fact that Faisal&#x27;s ineffectual half brother King Saud had imposed a cripplingly oil embargo on Britain and France during the Suez War of 1956 was not considered an important precedent. The CEOs of four of America&#x27;s oil companies had after speaking to Faisal arrived in Washington in May 1973 with the warning that Faisal was considerably tougher, more intelligent and more ruthless than his half-brother Saud whom he had deposed in 1964, and his threats were serious. Kissinger declined to meet the four CEOs.
In an assessment done by Kissinger and his staff about the Middle East in the summer of 1973, the repeated statements by Sadat about waging &quot;jihad&quot; against Israel were dismissed as empty talk while the warnings from King Faisal were likewise regarded as inconsequential. In September 1973, Nixon fired Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger. Kissinger was later to state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department&#x27;s office at Foggy Bottom as Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on October 6, 1973.

===The &quot;oil weapon&quot;===
On October 6, 1973, Egypt attacked the Bar Lev Line in the Sinai Peninsula and Syria launched an offensive in the Golan Heights, both of which had been occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. The war began during the height of the Watergate scandal and Nixon largely let Kissinger manage foreign policy as he was distracted by the scandal. On 8 October 1973, Faisal told two Egyptian envoys: &quot;You have made us all proud. In the past we could not lift our heads up. Now we can&quot;. Faisal promised to give to Egypt a quality of aid worth $200 million US dollars to assist with the war effort, and stated he was willing to use the &quot;oil weapon&quot; if necessary to support Egypt. Kissinger promised the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war, but sought initially to delay arm shipments to Israel as he believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 calling for a &quot;land for peace&quot; deal if an armistice was signed with Egypt and Syria gaining some territory in the Sinai and the Golan Heights respectively. Nixon had ordered an arms lift to Israel on 12 October 1973, but Kissinger used the excuse of bureaucratic delays to limit the amount of weapons and ammunition sent to Israel. The Arab concept of the &quot;peace of the brave&quot; (i.e. a victorious leader being magnanimous to his defeated opponents) meant there was a possibility that Sadat at least would make peace with Israel provided that the war ended in such a way that Egypt was not perceived to be defeated. Likewise, Kissinger regarded Meir as being rather arrogant and believed that an armistice that ended the war in a manner that was not an unambiguous Israeli victory would make her more humble.

As both Syria and Egypt lost much equipment during the fighting, the Soviet Union began to fly new equipment in starting on October 12, and the Soviet flights to Syria and Egypt were recorded by the British radar stations in Cyprus. Though the Soviets were flying in an average of 60 flights per day, exaggerated accounts appeared in Western newspapers speaking of &quot;one hundred flights per day&quot;. At this point, both Nixon and Kissinger began to see the October War more in terms of the Cold War rather than Middle Eastern politics, both seeing the Soviet arms lifts to Egypt and Syria as a Soviet power play that required an American answer. On October 12, 1973, US president Richard Nixon authorized Operation Nickel Grass, a strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel in order to replace its materiel losses, after the Soviet Union began sending arms to Syria and Egypt. The first American weapons to Israel arrived only on 15 October 1973, and despite Nixon&#x27;s orders the number of American planes flying into Tel Aviv were initially limited. After the first week of the war, the Israelis had halted the Syrian offensive in the Golan Heights and were pushing back the Syrians back towards Damascus, but along the Suez canal, there was heavy fighting with the Egyptians holding their own. Yamani stated in a 1981 interview: &quot;The king still wanted to give America a chance to stay out of the fighting. So we agreed to cut back production by just 5 percent per month. A full embargo, we agreed, was something we would implement only if we felt that things were absolutely hopeless&quot;.

At an OPEC summit at the Sheraton Hotel in Kuwait City on October 16, 1973, it was announced the price of oil would go from $3.01 U.S. dollars per barrel to $5.12 per barrel. After agreeing to the price increase, the Iranian delegation left Kuwait City as the Shah of Iran was only interested in higher oil prices. The Oil Minister of Iraq, Sa&#x27;dun Hammadi demanded the &quot;total nationalization&quot; of all assets of American oil companies in the Middle East, the withdrawal of all Arab funds from the United States and for all Arab states to break diplomatic relations with the United States. The Libyan Oil Minister, Izz al-Din al-Mabruk, called for the nationalization of all the assets of all Western oil companies in the Middle East. The news about the war on October 16 was grim from the Arab viewpoint with the Syrians steadily being pushed back while Israelis had opened a counter-offensive against the Egyptians and crossed the Great Bitter Lake. The Saudi delegation led by Yemani, supported by the Algerian delegation, fought hard against the Iraqi and Libyan demands for an embargo as Yemani maintained that forcing through an increase in the price of oil was the best way to influence the United States. Hammadi and the rest of the Iraqi delegation left in a huff as Yemani had won over the majority of the delegations to the Saudi viewpoint. The statement issued after midnight at the Sheraton Hotel was handwritten and reflecting the tense talk had several paragraphs crossed out while other paragraphs were written in by different hands.

On October 17, Arab oil producers cut production by 5% and instituted an oil embargo against Israel&#x27;s allies: the United States, the Netherlands, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Portugal. On October 17–19, 1973, the Saudi Foreign Minister, Omar Al Saqqaf, visited Washington together with the foreign ministers of Algeria, Kuwait and Morocco to warn that there was a real possibility of an oil embargo being imposed. Nixon promised him that the United States would mediate a settlement to the war that would be &quot;peaceful, just and honorable&quot; to both sides. He had ended the Vietnam war on an honorable basis and now intended to end the October war in the same manner. 
Saqqaf complained to King Faisal that Nixon seemed more interested in a dispute about &quot;a burglary&quot; (i.e. the Watergate scandal) than about the October War. During a press conference, an American reporter mocked the threat, contemptuously saying the Saudis &quot;could drink their oil&quot;, leading Saqqaf to reply in anger &quot;All right, we will!&quot;.

Israel took heavy losses in men and material during the fighting against Egypt and Syria, and on October 18, 1973, Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses. Nixon decided characteristically to act on an epic scale and instead of the $850 million worth of arms requested sent a request to Congress for some $2.2 billion worth of arms to Israel, which was promptly approved. Nixon, whose administration was being badly battered by the Watergate scandal, felt that a bold foreign policy move might resuscitate his administration. Nixon later boasted in his memoirs that the U.S. Air Force flew more sorties to Israel in October 1973 than it had during the Berlin Airlift of 1948–49, flying in a gargantuan quantity of arms, though he also admitted that by the time the arms lift had begun, the Israelis had already &quot;turned the tide of battle&quot; in their favor, making the arms lift irrelevant to the outcome of the war. In an interview with the British historian Robert Lacey in 1981, Kissinger later admitted about the arms lift to Israel: &quot;I made a mistake. In retrospect it was not the best considered decision we made&quot;.

The arms lift enraged King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and he retaliated on October 20, 1973, by placing a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States, to be joined by most of the other oil-producing Arab states. Even though Algeria, Iraq and Libya were promoting the embargo they were not actively enforcing it. Faisal was angry that Israel had only asked for $850 million worth of American weapons, and instead received an unsolicited $2.2 billion worth of weapons, which he perceived as a sign of the pro-Israeli slant of American foreign policy. Faisal also felt insulted that Nixon had just promised Saqqaf a &quot;honorable&quot; peace the day before he submitted the request to Congress for some $2.2 billion worth of arms for Israel, which he saw as an act of duplicity on Nixon&#x27;s part. Faisal had been opposed to a total embargo and only agreed to the 5% cut on October 17 under pressure from other Arab states. Faisal felt his efforts on behalf the United States were not being appreciated in Washington, which increased his fury at Nixon.

Saudi Arabia only consented to the embargo after Nixon&#x27;s promise of $2.2 billion in military aid to Israel. On the afternoon of October 19, 1973, Faisal was in his office when he learned about the United States sending $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Israel, and discussed the issue with two of his closest advisers, Abdullah ibn Abdul Rahman and Rashad Pharaon. The king called Yamani at about 8 pm, and told him he was needed at the Riyassa Palace immediately. Yamani told the king: &quot;The TV news goes out at nine. If you make a decision now, we can get it announced at once&quot;. The king replied &quot;Write this down&quot; and announced he was placing a total embargo on the United States.

The embargo was accompanied by gradual monthly production cuts—by December, production had been cut to 25% of September levels. This contributed to a global recession and increased tension between the United States and several of its European allies, who faulted the US for provoking an embargo by providing what many viewed as unconditional assistance to Israel. OAPEC demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from all territories beyond the 1949 Armistice border.

==Effectiveness of embargo==
The embargo lasted from October 1973 to March 1974. During a summit in Cairo on November 6, Kissinger asked Sadat what Faisal was like and was told: &quot;Well, Dr. Henry, he will probably go on with you about Communism and the Jews&quot;. King Faisal&#x27;s two great hatreds were Communism and Zionism as he believed that the Soviet Union and Israel were plotting together against Islam. When King Faisal was shown a translation into Arabic of &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, he instantly believed in the authenticity of &quot;The Protocols&quot; and therefore talked to anyone who would listen about what he had learned, despite the fact that &quot;The Protocols&quot; had been exposed as a forgery in 1921.

Initially, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger suggested to Kissinger that the USA invade Saudi Arabia and another Arab countries and seize their oil fields. Kissinger stated in a private state department meeting that it&#x27;s “ridiculous that the civilized world is held up by 8 million savages... Can’t we overthrow one of the sheikhs just to show that we can do it?” They formed a plan to invade Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Kissinger publicly threatened &quot;countermeasures&quot; in a Nov 21st, 1973 press conference if the embargo was not lifted, and the Saudis responded with threatening further oil cuts and to burn their oil fields if the US military invaded. After the CIA confirmed these threats, Kissinger gave up military intervention and decided that dealing with Israel&#x27;s troop withdrawals and settled on diplomatic solutions to the oil embargo.

On November 7, 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be &quot;evenhanded&quot; with the Arab-Israeli dispute. As the plane carrying him prepared to land in Riyadh, Kissinger was clearly nervous at the prospect of negotiating with the stern Wahhabi Faisal who had a marked dislike of Jews. Kissinger discovered that King Faisal was a worthy companion to Lê Đức Thọ in terms of stubbornness as the king accused the United States of being biased in favor of Israel, going on in a long rant about the balefulness of &quot;Jewish Communists&quot; in Russia and Israel, and despite all of Kissinger&#x27;s efforts to charm him, refused to end the oil embargo. Faisal told Kissinger: &quot;The United States used to stand up to aggression-you did that in World War Two and in 1956 during the Suez War. If the United States had done the same after 1967, we would not have witnessed the this deterioration... Before the Jewish State was established, there existed nothing to harm good relations between Arabs and Jews. There were many Jews in Arab countries. When the Jews were persecuted in Spain, Arabs protected them. When the Romans drove the Jews out, Arabs protected them. At Yalta, it was Stalin who said there had to be a Jewish state...Israel is advancing Communist objectives...Among those of the Jewish faith there are those who embrace Zionism...Most of the immigration to Israel is from the Soviet Union...They want to establish a Communist base right in the Middle East...And now, all over the world, the Jews are putting themselves into positions of authority&quot;. On February 22, 1974, King Faisal chaired the second summit of Islamic states in Lahore (which, unlike the first summit that Faisal had chaired in 1969, was not boycotted by Iraq and Syria) where he was acclaimed as a conquering hero who humiliated and humbled the West by wrecking its economy. The prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, opened the conference by stating: &quot;The armies of Pakistan are the armies of Islam. We shall enter Jerusalem as brothers-in-arms!&quot;

Only on March 18, 1974 did the king end the oil embargo after Sadat, whom he trusted, reported to him that the United States was being more &quot;evenhanded&quot; and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel. More importantly, Saudi Arabia had billions of dollars invested in Western banks, and the massive bout of inflation set off by the oil embargo was a threat to this fortune as inflation eroded the value of the money, giving Faisal a vested interest in helping to contain the damage he himself inflicted on the economies of the West.

Since Israeli forces did not withdraw to the 1949 Armistice Line, the majority of scholars believe that the embargo was a failure. Roy Licklieder, in his 1988 book &quot;Political Power and the Arab Oil Weapon&quot;, concluded that the embargo was a failure because the countries that were targeted by the embargo did not change their policies on the Arab–Israeli conflict. Licklieder believed that any long term changes were caused by the OPEC increase in the posted price of oil, and not the OAPEC embargo. Daniel Yergin, on the other hand, has said that the embargo &quot;remade the international economy&quot;. Lacey wrote: &quot;King Faisal&#x27;s momentous oil embargo of 20 October 1973 did not achieve a single one of its stated objectives. The ceasefire which the USA and the USSR together imposed two days later upon Israel, Syria and Egypt would have been imposed in any case; Israel ended the October war, thanks to US aid, better equipped militarily than she had ever been before, and Faisal&#x27;s ambition to shrink Israel back inside her pre-1949 boundaries remains unfulfilled to this day. Nor did the withholding of the 638,500 barrels of oil which the Saudi Arabia had been selling to America every day for the first 10 months of 1973 ever come, in itself, to jeopardizing the power or diverting the policies of the United States, since it accounted for less than 4 percent of America&#x27;s daily 17 million barrel consumption. It was the interaction which Faisal&#x27;s embargo had with other forces that made it so decisive. Arab politics had an immediate multiplier effect&quot;.

Because every Arab state except for Iraq and Libya joined the oil embargo, oil exports from the Middle East to the West were down by 60–70% by November 1973. Japan and the nations of western Europe imported some 75% of their oil from the Near East, and the embargo led to immediate and sharp price raises as Lacey noted that &quot;competing desperately for dwindling supplies, consumers showed themselves willing to pay unparalleled money for their oil&quot;. Saudi Arabia had 25% of the world&#x27;s oil reserves and the embargo imposed on the United States led to shortages of oil in the United States, which set an inflationary spiral as the new high prices for oil in the American market led to sharp increases of the price of oil in nations not subjected to the embargo. When the Iranian state oil company held an auction on December 16, 1973, bids for some $17 US dollars per barrel of oil were made. In late December 1973, OPEC held a conference in Vienna when it was announced the price for a barrel of oil was to from $5 US dollars per barrel to $11.65 US dollars per barrel. Faisal was opposed to the price increase, which was largely the work of the Iranian delegation.

Over the long term, the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the West towards increased exploration, alternative energy research, energy conservation and more restrictive monetary policy to better fight inflation.

==Effects==

The effects of the embargo were immediate. OPEC forced oil companies to increase payments drastically. The price of oil quadrupled by 1974 from US$3 to nearly US$12 per 42 gallon barrel ($75 per cubic meter), equivalent in 2018 dollars to a price rise from $ to $ per barrel. Saudi Arabia had 25% of the world&#x27;s oil, but only 4% of the oil used in the United States in 1973 came from the kingdom. However, Saudi Arabia plays an over-sized role within the Arab world, and as a Beirut oil consultant noted in 1974: &quot;If Saudi Arabia moves from A to B, then every other oil producer must move at least as far, if not to C.&quot; In 1973, about 25% of the oil used in the United States came from Arab countries. The mere shortage of oil caused by the Arab oil embargo within the United States forced prices to raise, which in turn led prices to rise everywhere all over the world as oil producers that had not joined the embargo such as Iran, Venezuela, Libya and Iraq demanded higher prices in Japan and Europe as an initiative to ship oil to those places instead of the United States, thus settling off a worldwide inflationary spiral. The only European nations subject to the oil embargo were the Netherlands (because the Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel was strongly pro-Israeli) and Portugal (in a support of show for the independence movements in Portugal&#x27;s African colonies), but the shortage of oil in the United States led to sharp price rises in all of the European nations. The embargo itself did not cause much economic difficulty in the United States as the Americans simply imported more oil from nations that were not part of the embargo such as Iran, but the 400% increase in the price of oil caused by the embargo did damage the American economy. A number of nations such as Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran and Iraq increased their oil production during the embargo, but just sold their oil at a higher price. The leader who pushed the most for higher oil prices was the Shah of Iran, and the Italian historian Giuliano Garavini has argued that the leader most responsible for the West&#x27;s economic problems during the &quot;oil shock&quot; was not King Faisal, but rather the Shah. Some of the nations that were classified as &quot;friendly&quot; to the Arab viewpoint in regards to the Arab-Israeli dispute such as France and Belgium were the ones who suffered the most from the worldwide inflation caused by the embargo.

The crisis eased when the embargo was lifted in March 1974 after negotiations at the Washington Oil Summit, but the effects lingered throughout the 1970s. The dollar price of energy increased again the following year, amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets.

The Arab oil embargo ended the long period of prosperity in the West that had begun in 1945, throwing the world&#x27;s economy into the steepest economic contraction since the Great Depression. The &quot;long summer&quot; of prosperity in the post-war years had made possible the &quot;swinging sixties&quot; and the related rise of a rebellious youth culture as it was very easy to be hedonist and/or in rebellion against traditional values in a time of unprecedented affluence and prosperity. Lacey wrote about the impact of the Arab oil embargo of 1973–74 that for people in the West life suddenly become &quot;slower, darker and chiller&quot; as gasoline was rationed, the lights were turned off in Times Square, the &quot;gas guzzler&quot; automobiles suddenly stopped selling, speed limits became common and restrictions were placed on weekend driving in a bid to conserve fuel. As the American automobile industry specialized in producing heavy &quot;gas guzzler&quot; vehicles, there was an immediate shift on the part of consumers to the lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles produced by the Japanese and West German automobile industries, sending the American automobile industry into decline. The years from 1945 to 1973 had been a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, a &quot;long summer&quot; that many believed would never end, and its abrupt end in 1973 as the oil embargo which increased the price of oil by 400% within a matter of days threw the world&#x27;s economy into a sharp recession with unemployment mounting and inflation raging came as a profound shock. The end of what the French called the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot; (&quot;Glorious Thirty&quot; [years]) led to a mood of widespread pessimism in the West with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; running a famous headline in late 1973 saying &quot;The Future will be subject to Delay&quot;. Kurt Waldheim, the secretary-general of the United Nations in an address to the General Assembly complained about &quot;the note of helplessness and fatalism creeping into world affairs&quot;. The sudden and abrupt end of the &quot;long summer&quot; of prosperity in 1973-1974 played a major role in the pessimistic mood that characterized the culture of the rest of the 1970s. In 1975, a report to Congress from the Federal Energy Administration estimated that the embargo of 1973–1974 had caused about 500,000 Americans to lose their jobs and caused a GNP loss between $10 billion–$20 billion.

===Impact on oil exporting nations===
This price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations, for the countries of the Middle East who had long been dominated by the industrial powers were seen to have taken control of a vital commodity. The oil-exporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth.
Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand. Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, throughout the world, via religious charities such as the al-Haramain Foundation, which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The 400% increase in the world oil prices led to extravagant promises being made by the leaders of oil-producing nations. The Shah of Iran told his subjects in a speech in December 1973 that he was launching &quot;Great Civilization&quot; project that would make Iran into a First World nation by the 1990s; President Carlos Andrés Pérez of Venezuela likewise launched his &quot;Le Gran Venezuela&quot; project intended to make Venezuela into a First World nation; and President Yakubu Gowon of Nigeria told his people that henceforward Nigeria&#x27;s main problem would be &quot;managing abundance&quot;. After the oil shock, Nigeria presented itself as the first African nation that would reach First World status and in Lagos a series of stately modernist buildings were erected as appropriate for a nation that saw itself as the leader of all black Africa. Much of the oil wealth in Nigeria was stolen by corrupt politicians. However, at least some of Nigeria&#x27;s new oil wealth went to rebuild the areas devastated by the civil war of 1967-1970 and to address the complaints that too much of Nigeria&#x27;s oil wealth went to the federal government in Lagos instead of the people. In Iran, the Shah who was aware by 1974 that he had developed the cancer that was to ultimately kill him in 1980 pushed very strongly for his &quot;Great Civilization&quot; for rapid modernization not the least because he wanted to see the &quot;Great Civilization&quot; before his death, which explained his grandiose announcements. The new wealth generated by the &quot;oil shock&quot; allowed for Chairman Houari Boumédiène of Algeria to become a global leader, courted by elites in both the First World and the Third World.

The oil embargo led a sudden interest in the Palestinian issue. Between 1973 and 1981, Saudi Arabia donated a sum worth $1 billion US dollars to the Palestine Liberation Organization, which thus had a budget that exceeded that of many Third World nations. On November 8, 1973, Kissinger became the first Secretary of State to meet with a Saudi leader since 1953 as he met King Faisal to ask him to end the embargo. Within two week of the embargo being launched, all of the foreign ministers of the nations of the European Economic Community (now the European Union) met in a conference to issue a statement calling for Israel &quot;to end the territorial occupation which has maintained since the conflict of 1967&quot;. On December 11, 1973, the Japanese Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ōhira flew in to Riyadh to meet King Faisal for &quot;talks on improving bilateral relations&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the French foreign minister Michel Jobert arrived to sign an agreement that provided oil for France for the next twenty years. On January 24, 1974, as the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was coming off the ski slopes of St. Moritz, he was met by the British Chancellor of Exchequer, Anthony Barber, and the Trade Secretary, Peter Walker. In a role-reversal, Barber and Walker paid homage to the Shah, who promised them that his nation would sell the United Kingdom 5 million tons of oil in exchange for some £100 million of British goods to aid his plans to industrialize Iran.

Saudi Arabia experienced an upsurge of prosperity and affluence after the oil embargo whose consequences horrified King Faisal. Faisal who was devoted to a harsh puritanical strain of Sunni Islam known in the West as Wahhabism was appalled by the way that his subjects became materialistic, devoted only to conspicuous consumption and greed as they lost interest in Islam. Lacey wrote: &quot;The spiritual dangers of easy affluence distressed him more. His simple gesture of piety and honor seemed to have opened a Pandora&#x27;s Box that threatened to turn his realm into a parody of all he held dear&quot;. In the last two of years of his life, Faisal fell into depression over the way his subjects had been seduced into a consumerist lifestyle, becoming lost in a sense of &quot;melancholia&quot;. Faisal&#x27;s son, Crown Prince Mohammad told Lacey in 1981: &quot;The profligacy, the greed, he felt he could not stem it. He become so bound up in his work, there was almost nothing private of him left&quot;. A sign of the changed values was that despite the total ban on alcohol in Saudi Arabia that drinking along with drug use become common with the younger members of the House of Saud. James Akins, the American ambassador in Riyadh reported; &quot;the sky over Riyadh is black with vultures with new get-richer-quicker plans under their wings&quot;. In 1974, property prices in Riyadh doubled on a weekly basis for the entire year as the prosperity led to a real estate speculation bubble that was often compared to the Klondike gold rush of 1898–1899. At the Red Sea port of Jeddah, there were so many ships queuing up laden with cement for the construction boom in Saudi Arabia that construction contractors hired helicopters to fly the cement in, twenty bags per flight. A number of families engaged in the Saudi construction industry such as the Juffali, Alireza, al-Khasshoggi and the bin Laden families all become very wealthy as a result of the construction boom. The period after the oil shock of 1973–1974 is still fondly remembered in Saudi Arabia as the &quot;age of abundance&quot; where nearly everyone had a significant increase in their standard of living.

The wealth and corruption generated by the oil shock led to a fundamentalist backlash in Saudi Arabia. On 20 November 1979, Islam&#x27;s most holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque of Mecca, was seized by a group of fanatics who proclaimed themselves to be the followers of the Mahdi (a messianic figure said to appear at the dawn of every Muslim century to strike down the enemies of Islam). The leader of the uprising, Juhayman al-Otaybi, read out a list of grievances as he accused the House of Saud of being corrupt and degenerate as he listed by name a number of Saudi princes who were engaged in dubious business dealings and/or who drank alcohol. The Saudi Army recaptured the Grand Mosque and the surviving &quot;renegades&quot; as the rebels were labelled were executed. Likewise, the perception that most of the wealth being generated by the now higher price of oil was being stolen by a corrupt Shah along with the unfulfilled promises of the &quot;Great Civilization&quot; project played a major role in causing the Iranian Revolution of 197–1979 that toppled the Shah and led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in February 1979. In Algeria, the &quot;oil shock&quot; led to the establishment of a welfare state where none had existed previously. The lower oil prices of the 1980s along with cutbacks and the belief that the FLN regime was corrupt helped cause the riots of October 1988 against the FLN regime that killed at least 500 people. The riots were largely caused by the fact that the low oil prices had forced the Algerian state to end many of its more generous social policies between 1986 and 1988, leading to an unemployment rate of 30% by 1988 along with the knowledge that the FLN regime had stolen millions. In the aftermath of the October riots, President Chadli Bendjedid began a transition to democracy. The first free elections in Algeria in January 1992 were won by the Islamist FIS, which led to a military coup and an outbreak of civil war that was to kill hundreds of thousands.

OPEC-member states raised the prospect of nationalization of oil company holdings. Most notably, Saudi Arabia nationalized Aramco in 1980 under the leadership of Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani. As other OPEC nations followed suit, the cartel&#x27;s income soared. Saudi Arabia undertook a series of ambitious five-year development plans. The biggest began in 1980, funded at $250 billion. Other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs.

===Oil weapon===
Control of oil became known as the &quot;oil weapon&quot;. It came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the Arab states. The weapon was aimed at the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. These target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more pro-Arab position. Production was eventually cut by 25%. However, the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes.

The risk that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to Washington than oil. Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger&#x27;s dominance.

===Impact on United States ===

In the US production, distribution and price disruptions &quot;have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth.&quot; Some researchers regard the 1973 &quot;oil price shock&quot; and the accompanying 1973–74 stock market crash as the first discrete event since the Great Depression to have a persistent effect on the US economy.

The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security. On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles. Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to 10 years before significant production.

The average US retail price of a gallon of regular gasoline rose 43% from 38.5¢ in May 1973 to 55.1¢ in June 1974. State governments asked citizens not to put up Christmas lights. Oregon banned Christmas and commercial lighting altogether. Politicians called for a national gasoline rationing program. Nixon asked gasoline retailers to voluntarily not sell gasoline on Saturday nights or Sundays; 90% of gas station owners complied, which produced long lines of motorists wanting to fill up their cars while they still could.

The &quot;oil shock&quot; provided considerable impetus to the American nuclear industry as a way to achieve &quot;energy independence&quot; from the Middle East. On 7 November 1973, Nixon in an address to Congress called for Project Independence to make the United States self-sufficient in energy by 1980, which called for a massive investment in the nuclear industry. Nixon seems to have assumed that nuclear energy was economical, and was encouraged by the faddish enthusiasm of many officials who more on the basis of faith than rationality saw nuclear energy as the technology of the future. By the late 1960s, a lively environmentalist movement had emerged in the United States, and the Project Independence nuclear program was the subject of much debate in both the media and Congress. The ensuing debates revealed that many of the claims made for nuclear power vast underestimated the true costs of nuclear reactors. Equally problematic was the troublesome issue of where to safety store the spent nuclear rods that emitted a toxic level of radioactivity for centuries afterward in an cost-effective manner. The issue of the spent nuclear rods was especially difficult because in a classic case of NIMBYism, communities proved very unwilling to accept a storage place for the inevitable by-product of nuclear power, the spent nuclear rods, with the demand being made that the government find some other community to store the rods. Many of the nuclear reactors ordered in 1973 were cancelled due to the horrendous cost overruns while over 100 nuclear plants were shut down as uneconomical over the next 10 years. Unlike nations that tried to use nuclear power as a way for &quot;energy independence&quot; such as France and Sweden, the United States had substantial reserves of its own oil, which weakened the case for nuclear power in the ensuring debates. By 1989, only 18% of American energy came from nuclear power plants, which was a faction of what Project Independence had envisioned in 1973.

The &quot;oil shock&quot; led to anti-Arab feelings becoming common. Cartoons published in American newspapers during the &quot;oil shock&quot; depicted Arabs as disgusting, ugly, obese, corrupt and greedy. In the cartoons, the long hooked Semitic noses that had traditionally been featured in anti-Jewish cartoons were applied to the Arab sheiks as a way to illustrate their supposed greed. American public opinion did not see the use of the &quot;oil weapon&quot; as due to politics, and tended to explain the embargo as only due to the excessive greed of King Faisal and the other Arab leaders, hence the use of the hooked Semitic nose in the cartoons as a sort of shorthand for insatiable greed.

===Impact of the Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union was not a beneficiary of the oil crisis. The crisis prompted the USSR to raise energy prices within the Council on Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). The inability of the USSR to meet energy demand from its allies led those &quot;East European governments to purchase oil from Middle Eastern countries at increasing world market prices, crippling their balance of payments and accentuating their other economic shortcomings.&quot;

===Impact on Western Europe===
The embargo was not uniform across Western Europe. In 1969, France devalued the franc. The devalued franc made exports more expensive for French consumers, which encouraged them to buy French, while making French more cheaper abroad. France was entirely dependent upon imported oil (through French companies continued to lease the oil concessions in Algeria until 1971). The low price of oil internationally compensated to a certain extent for the higher price of oil caused by the devaluation. The devalued franc ensured that the dramatic price increases caused by the &quot;oil shock&quot; hit the French economy especially hard in 1973. The UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Norway banned flying, driving and boating on Sundays. Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil. The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity.

Of the nine members of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a complete embargo. By contrast Britain and France received almost uninterrupted supplies. That was their reward for refusing to allow the US to use their airfields and stopping arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis. The other six EEC nations faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson&#x27;s government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.

The EEC was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the embargo. It issued a statement on November 6, after the embargo and price rises had begun. It was widely viewed as pro-Arab, supporting the Franco-British line on the war. OPEC duly lifted its embargo from all EEC members. The other European states did not rally in defense of the Dutch who were left to fend for themselves and instead reached bilateral deals with Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. Faced with a recession, there was a tendency within the EEC nations to turn inwards away from European integration. The price rises had a much greater impact in Europe than the embargo. The crisis retarded the movement towards European economic integration which had been gathering pace ever since the EEC (now the European Union) had been founded in 1957. The German historian Jens-Uwe Wunderlich wrote that in 1973 attempts to finish off the European common market came to a &quot;complete standstill&quot; in 1973 and it was not until 1977 that movement towards creating the common market resumed. As the EEC&#x27;s customs union had made it impossible to raise tariffs against other EEC members, there was a tendency, especially pronounced in France and the United Kingdom, for governments to subside &quot;national champions&quot; with selected corporations receiving grants and tax breaks as a response to the crisis. In particular, the &quot;oil shock&quot; increased the appeal of nuclear energy as a way to achieve &quot;energy independence&quot; from the turbulent Middle East. Starting in March 1974 with the &quot;Energy Plan&quot; introduced by the premier Pierre Messmer, the French state made a massive investment in nuclear energy and by the 1990s 80% of all of France&#x27;s energy came from nuclear plants.

===Impact on United Kingdom===
The North Sea oil fields, which were discovered in 1969, did not start to be exploited until 1975, making the United Kingdom entirely dependent upon imported oil in 1973. The way that world oil prices quadrupled in late 1973 had a very adverse impact on the British economy. In a series of speeches in December 1973, the Prime Minister Edward Heath warned that because of the &quot;oil shock&quot; that the British economy was going into recession and the British people should expect economic austerity. The need to avoid importing the now more expensive oil to help manage the balance-of-payments led the Heath government to turn towards coal (which Britain was self-sufficient in) as a substitute source of energy, which gave the coal miners union immense leverage over the government to press for higher wages for the coal miners. Heath offered the coal miners a 7% wage increase, which was rejected as insufficient by the miners who went on strike. Through not subjected to the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an energy crisis of its own—a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the defeat of Heath&#x27;s Conservative government in February 1974 general elections. The new Labour government told the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter. The Labour government of Harold Wilson settled the strike by giving the coal miners a 35% pay increase.

===Impact on Japan===
Japan was hard hit since it imported 90% of its oil from the Middle East. It had a stockpile good for 55 days, and another 20-day supply was en route. Facing its most serious crisis since 1945 the government ordered a 10% cut in the consumption of industrial oil and electricity. In December it ordered an immediate 20% cut in oil use and electric power to Japan&#x27;s major industries, and cutbacks in leisure automobile usage. Economist predicted the growth rate would plunge from 5% annually down to zero or even negative territory. Inflation hit 9%. Seeking to take advantage of the crisis, Japanese business called on the government to relax its controls on air pollution and water pollution. The government refused. Moscow tried to take advantage by promising energy assistance if Japan renounced its claim to the Kurile Islands. Tokyo refused. Instead it made $3.3 billion of dollars in loans to the Arab states and called on Israel to step back. Japan&#x27;s defensive strategy was explained to Kissinger when he met with top leaders in Tokyo in November 1973. In the long run Japan never wavered in its determination to maintain very strong close ties to the United States, while in self-defense briefly providing the Arab powers with the rhetoric they demanded in return for resuming oil shipments in early 1974.

To assure future oil flows, Japan added suppliers outside of the Middle East; invested in nuclear power; imposed conservation measures; and provided funding for Arab governments and the Palestinians. The crisis was a major factor in the long-run shift of Japan&#x27;s economy away from oil-intensive industries. Investment shifted to electronics. Japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis. The jump in gasoline prices helped their small, fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the &quot;gas-guzzling&quot; Detroit competition. This triggered a drop in American sales of American brands that lasted into the 1980s.

===Impact on India===
The oil crisis contributed to the poor state of the Indian economy and played a role in Indira Gandhi&#x27;s decision to impose The Emergency, a dictatorship. The state led a push for coal as an energy source, even though there were reservations about its adverse environmental effects.

===Impact on South Vietnam===
The oil shock destroyed the economy of South Vietnam. A spokesman for President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu admitted in a TV interview that the government was being &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was &quot;like making love to a corpse&quot;. In December 1973, Vietcong sappers attacked and destroyed the petroleum depot of Nha Be, further depleting fuel sources. By the summer of 1974, the U.S. embassy in Saigon reported that morale in the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) had fallen to dangerously low levels and it was uncertain how much more longer South Vietnam would last. As inflation eroded the value of the South Vietnamese &quot;đồng&quot;, it became common by the summer of 1974 to see ARVN soldiers and their families begging in the streets for food. In December 1974, the North Vietnamese PAVN (People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam) launched an offensive in the Central Highlands, which far more successful than expected as the ARVN, which was suffering from low morale, put up a feeble resistance. On March 1, 1975, the PAVN launched a major offensive that saw them quickly overrun the Central Highlands and by March 25, 1975, Hue had fallen. Following their victory in the Central Highlands, the North Vietnamese launched the &quot;Ho Chi Minh Campaign&quot; that saw Saigon fall on April 30, 1975.

===Impact on southern Africa===
Three of the nations targeted by the embargo were located in southern Africa or had colonies there. Portugal which ruled the colonies of Angola, Portuguese Guiana (modern Guinea-Bissau), and Portuguese East Africa (modern Mozambique) had fighting colonial wars in all of its African colonies since the 1960s with Angola being the first to rise up in 1961. Angola is rich in oil, which protected Portugal from the worse of the embargo. But the economic stability of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime was damaged by the worldwide inflation, which help cause the Carnation Revolution which toppled the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime in April 1974 and led to the restoration of democracy. Portugal granted independence to all of its colonies except for Macau in 1975.

The British historian Rob Skinner wrote the embargo had a &quot;significant impact&quot; on the South African economy. The inflationary rise in commodity prices increased the input costs of South African manufacturing, making South African manufactured goods uncompetitive on the world market. The rise in the price of gold as a hedge against inflation (South Africa has the world&#x27;s largest gold mines) caused the &quot;rand&quot; to increase in value, which caused further problems for South African manufacturing. The strategy pursued by the National Party government since 1948 of sponsoring the industrialization of South Africa was derailed by the &quot;oil shock&quot; with what Skinner described as &quot;important social and political consequences&quot; for the &quot;apartheid&quot; regime. The Soweto uprising of 1976 was at least in part caused by anger at the high unemployment rate in black South African community.

Even worse hit than South Africa was Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe), where oil was already expensive as the white supremacist government of Rhodesia had been under United Nations sanctions since 1965, and thus the smugglers who sold Rhodesia oil charged a premium for their services. The premium charged by the &quot;sanctions busters&quot; such as Iran increased after the embargo, which threw the Rhodesian economy into recession. Despite the United Nations sanctions, Rhodesia was a major exporter of chrome, steel and tobacco with the United States exempting &quot;strategical&quot; Rhodesian products such as chrome from the sanctions. The global recession of 1973–1975 proved more effective than the United Nations in ending the global demand for Rhodesian products, which made the Rhodesian recession especially severe. Unlike South Africa, which had a sizable and long-standing white population, the white population of Rhodesia was much smaller and more recent. Rhodesia depended considerably more than South Africa on white immigration to provide enough soldiers for its army while most of the Rhodesian whites had only arrived in the 1950s and did not have very deep roots in the country. The &quot;white flight&quot; caused by the recession put the Rhodesian Army at a major disadvantage in its war against the black guerrillas. The war costed the Rhodesian government one million Rhodesian dollars per day by 1975, and the costs of the war threatened to bankrupt Rhodesia. In 1979, Rhodesia signed the Lancaster House Agreement, which led to majority rule in 1980.

===Price controls and rationing===
====United States====

Price controls exacerbated the crisis in the US. The system limited the price of &quot;old oil&quot; (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973. A sign of the change caused by the crisis was that in 1974 the Exxon oil company (which had once been part of the Standard Oil company) replaced the General Motors corporation to be the largest corporation in the world as measured by gross sales revenues.

In 1973, Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo. Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing. In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common. The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974, 20% of American gasoline stations had no fuel.

Odd–even rationing allowed vehicles with license plates having an odd number as the last digit (or a vanity license plate) to buy gas only on odd-numbered days of the month, while others could buy only on even-numbered days.

In some states, a three-color flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stations—green for unrationed availability, yellow for restricted/rationed sales and red for out of stock.
Rationing led to violent incidents, when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in December 1973 over the limited supplies that Simon had allocated for their industry. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers, and in Arkansas, trucks of non-strikers were attacked with bombs.

America had controlled the price of natural gas since the 1950s. With the inflation of the 1970s, the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves. America&#x27;s natural gas reserves dwindled from 237 trillion in 1974 to 203 trillion in 1978. The price controls were not changed, despite president Gerald Ford&#x27;s repeated requests to Congress.
===Conservation and reduction in demand===
====United States====
To help reduce consumption, in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (89 km/h) was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act. Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975, and in 1977 the cabinet-level Department of Energy was created, followed by the National Energy Act of 1978. On November 28, 1995, President Bill Clinton signed the National Highway Designation Act, ending the federal 55 mph speed limit which allowed states to restore their prior maximum speed limit. Year-round daylight saving time was implemented from January 6, 1974, to October 27, 1975, with a break between October 27, 1974, and February 23, 1975, when the country observed standard time. Parents complained that it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise. The prior rules were restored in 1976.
The crisis prompted a call to conserve energy, most notably a campaign by the Advertising Council using the tagline &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Fuelish&quot;. Many newspapers carried advertisements featuring cut-outs that could be attached to light switches, reading &quot;Last Out, Lights Out: Don&#x27;t Be Fuelish&quot;.

Although not regulated by the new legislation, auto racing groups voluntarily began conserving. In 1974, NASCAR reduced all race distances by 10%; the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring race were cancelled.

In 1975, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed, leading to the creation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that required improved fuel economy for cars and light trucks.

In 1976, Congress created the Weatherization Assistance Program to help low-income homeowners and renters reduce their demand for heating and cooling through better insulation.

By 1980, domestic luxury cars with a wheelbase and gross weights averaging 4,500 pounds (2,041 kg) were no longer made. The automakers had begun phasing out the traditional front engine/rear-wheel drive layout in compact cars in favor of lighter front engine/front-wheel drive designs. A higher percentage of cars offered more efficient four-cylinder engines. Domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well.

===Alternative energy sources===
The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels. According to Peter Grossman, American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. He wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, Congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.

The Brazilian government implemented its &quot;Proálcool&quot; (pro-alcohol) project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gasoline for automotive fuel.

Israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo, since it could extract sufficient oil from the Sinai. But to supplement Israel&#x27;s over-taxed power grid, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel&#x27;s solar industry, developed the prototype for a solar water heater now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.

===Macroeconomy===
Western central banks decided to sharply cut interest rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers. The policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo. Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.

The price shock created large current account deficits in oil-importing economies. A petrodollar recycling mechanism was created, through which OPEC surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the West to finance the current account deficits. The functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of capital controls in oil-importing economies. It marked the beginning of an exponential growth of Western capital markets.

In the United States in 1974, seven of the 15 top Fortune 500 companies were oil companies, falling to four in 2014.

===International relations===
The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974. and again during the 1979 energy crisis.

====United States====
America&#x27;s Cold War policies suffered a major blow from the embargo. They had focused on China and the Soviet Union, but the latent challenge to US hegemony coming from the Third World became evident. In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the US was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that &quot;it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.&quot; British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of US intentions, which concluded that America &quot;might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries&quot;, and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi if military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned &quot;the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the &#x27;total alienation&#x27; of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.&quot;

====NATO====
Western Europe began switching from pro-Israel to more pro-Arab policies. This change strained the Western alliance. The US, which imported only 12% of its oil from the Middle East (compared with 80% for the Europeans and over 90% for Japan), remained staunchly committed to Israel. The percentage of US oil which comes from the nations bordering the Persian Gulf remained steady over the decades, with a figure of a little more than 10% in 2008.

With the embargo in place, many developed countries altered their policies regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict. These included the UK, which refused to allow the United States to use British bases and Cyprus to airlift resupplies to Israel, along with the rest of the members of the European Community.

Canada shifted towards a more pro-Arab position after displeasure was expressed towards Canada&#x27;s mostly neutral position. &quot;On the other hand, after the embargo the Canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the Arab position, despite its low dependence on Middle Eastern oil&quot;.

====Japan====
Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East, Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71% of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970. On November 7, 1973, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a &quot;nonfriendly&quot; country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy. It received a 5% production cut in December, causing a panic. On November 22, Japan issued a statement &quot;asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating Palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions&quot;. By December 25, Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state.

====Nonaligned nations====
The oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a right-wing military coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet toppled socialist president Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. The response of the Nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales. As a consequence, an opposing Latin American bloc was organized and financed in part by Venezuelan oil revenues, which quadrupled between 1970 and 1975.

A year after the start of the embargo, the UN&#x27;s nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a &quot;New International Economic Order&quot; under which nations within the global South would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their self-development.

====Arab states====
Prior to the embargo, the geo-political competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources, presented the Arab States with financial security, moderate economic growth, and disproportionate international bargaining power.

The oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between Arab countries and the US and USSR. At the time, Egypt, Syria and Iraq were allied with the USSR, while Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran (plus Israel) aligned with the US. Vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers. When Anwar Sadat became president of Egypt in 1970, he dismissed Soviet specialists in Egypt and reoriented towards the US.

Concerns over economic domination from increased Soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan—a major turning point in Cold War geopolitics -, turning the Persian Gulf states towards the US for security guarantees against Soviet military action, also coming at a time marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence to various US-allied nations. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel&#x27;s.

In the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979, and a Shiite Muslim revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year, which was known as the 1979 Qatif Uprising. Saudi Arabia is a near-absolute monarchy, an Arabic speaking country, and has a Sunni Muslim majority, while Persian speaking Iran since 1979 is an Islamist theocracy with a Shiite Muslim majority, which explains the current hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Before the Iranian Revolution the usually pro-American, anti-communist and largely Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabians were somewhat wary of the pro-Soviet relations held by the Ba&#x27;athist socialist and relatively secularist republican dictatorship of Iraq, the latter of which is a majority Shiite Muslim Arab nation which was ruled by a Sunni Muslim Arab minority before the Iraq War, and how that affected the Saudis&#x27; own relations with the Iraqis, because these two oil-rich Arab nations share a long land border with each other.

===Automobile industry===

The oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally, which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come.

====Western Europe====
After World War II, most West European countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports, and as a result most cars made in Europe were smaller and more economical than their American counterparts. By the late 1960s, increasing incomes supported rising car sizes.

The oil crisis pushed West European car buyers away from larger, less economical cars. The most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks. The only notable small hatchbacks built in Western Europe before the oil crisis were the Peugeot 104, Renault 5 and Fiat 127. By the end of the decade, the market had expanded with the introduction of the Ford Fiesta, Opel Kadett (sold as the Vauxhall Astra in Great Britain), Chrysler Sunbeam and Citroën Visa.

Buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to medium-sized hatchbacks. Virtually unknown in Europe in 1973, by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing sedans as the mainstay of this sector. Between 1973 and 1980, medium-sized hatchbacks were launched across Europe: the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, Fiat Ritmo (Strada in the UK), Ford Escort MK3, Renault 14, Volvo 340 / 360, Opel Kadett, and Volkswagen Golf.

These cars were considerably more economical than the traditional saloons they were replacing, and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles. Some 15 years after the oil crisis, hatchbacks dominated most European small and medium car markets, and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market.

====United States====

Before the energy crisis, large, heavy, and powerful cars were popular. By 1971, the standard engine in a Chevrolet Caprice was a 400-cubic inch (6.5 liter) V8. The wheelbase of this car was , and &quot;Motor Trend&quot; 1972 road test of the similar Chevrolet Impala achieved no more than 15 highway miles per gallon. In the 15 years prior to the 1973 oil crisis, gasoline prices in the U.S. had lagged well behind inflation.

The crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.

From Europe, the Volkswagen Beetle, the Volkswagen Fastback, the Renault 8, the Renault LeCar, and the Fiat Brava were successful. Detroit responded with the Ford Pinto, the Ford Maverick, the Chevrolet Vega, the Chevrolet Nova, the Plymouth Valiant and the Plymouth Volaré. American Motors sold its homegrown Gremlin, Hornet and Pacer models.

Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.

Compact trucks were introduced, such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck, followed by the Mazda Truck (sold as the Ford Courier), and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV. Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. Later, the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their captive import policy.

An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales. The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler, the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s. By 1985, the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970. The improvements stayed, even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979.
Sales of large sedans for most makes (except Chrysler products) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis. The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, Lincoln Continental, Mercury Marquis, and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s. The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie 500. Slightly smaller models such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Ford Thunderbird and various others sold well.

Economical imports succeeded alongside heavy, expensive vehicles. In 1976, Toyota sold 346,920 cars (average weight around 2,100 lbs), while Cadillac sold 309,139 cars (average weight around 5,000 lbs).

Federal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT &quot;downsize&quot; revision of vehicle categories. By 1977, GM&#x27;s full-sized cars reflected the crisis. By 1979, virtually all &quot;full-size&quot; American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions. Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans).

==Consequences==
===Decline of OPEC===

OPEC soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries. Additionally, its own member nations were divided. Saudi Arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers. The world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels. This &quot;sale&quot; price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed.

During the Iran-Iraq war of 1980–1988, the stated war aim of Iran was to overthrow the Baath regime in Iraq and then overthrow the House of Saud in Saudi Arabia. As a consequence, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf states leaned in a very pro-Iraqi neutrality during the war. As a part of its policy of supporting Iraq, Saudi Arabia pumped out oil in massive quantities to lower the price as a way of hurting Iran&#x27;s economy. The low price of oil also hurt Iraq&#x27;s economy, which forced Iraq to borrow massive sums of money, putting Iraq deeply into debt; by contrast, Iran refused to borrow any money because of its refusal to pay interest on any loans and paid the costs of the war direct from the sale of its oil. Iran&#x27;s revenue from the sale of oil went from $20 billion US dollars per year in 1982 to $5 billion US dollars per year by 1988, which pushed Iran to the verge of bankruptcy and forced Iran to finally make peace with Iraq later in 1988. During the war, the Iranian delegation at OPEC tried very hard to have the group cut production to raise prices, but were blocked by the other delegations led by the Saudi delegation, who insisted on more oil production.

===Oil sources diversification===
The embargo encouraged new venues for energy exploration, including Alaska, the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus. Exploration in the Caspian Basin and Siberia became profitable. Cooperation changed into a far more adversarial relationship as the USSR increased its production. By 1980, the Soviet Union had become the world&#x27;s largest producer.

Part of the decline in prices and economic and geopolitical power of OPEC came from the move to alternative energy sources. OPEC had relied on price inelasticity to maintain high consumption, but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand. Electricity generation from nuclear power and natural gas, home heating from natural gas, and ethanol-blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil.

===Economic impact===
The drop in prices presented a serious problem for oil-exporting countries in northern Europe and the Persian Gulf. Heavily populated, impoverished countries, whose economies were largely dependent on oil—including Mexico, Nigeria, Algeria, and Libya—did not prepare for a market reversal that left them in sometimes desperate situations.

When reduced demand and increased production glutted the world market in the mid-1980s, oil prices plummeted and the cartel lost its unity. Mexico (a non-member), Nigeria, and Venezuela, whose economies had expanded in the 1970s, faced near-bankruptcy, and even Saudi Arabian economic power was significantly weakened. The divisions within OPEC made concerted action more difficult. , OPEC has never approached its earlier dominance.

<doc id="244189" wikidata="Q5666667" url="?curid=244189" title="Harrowsmith Country Life">
<text>Harrowsmith Country Life was a magazine that explored and showcased country living. Originally called Harrowsmith, the magazine was heralded as a back-to-the-land and environmental issues platform. In 1976, founder James M. Lawrence cut and pasted the first issues together on a kitchen table in the tiny village of Camden East (pop. 256) in Ontario, Canada. Within two years, the magazine had over 100,000 subscribers and eventually became Canada&#x27;s 8th largest magazine. Camden House Publishing Inc. was created in 1977 as the parent company for the Harrowsmith and Equinox magazines and later for many books.

In 1988, Lawrence sold &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; to the Canadian media company Telemedia, where it remained until 1996. Telemedia launched an American edition, and the words &quot;Country Life&quot; were tacked onto &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s&quot; title. The American edition reached a paid circulation of 225,000 but folded as Telemedia began making changes to their publishing business. In 1995, it launched a television show to complement the magazine.

Editor Tom Cruickshank took the helm of &quot;Harrowsmith Country Life&quot; in 1996, after Telemedia sold &quot;Harrowsmith Country Life&quot;, and its sister publication &quot;Equinox&quot;, to Malcolm Publishing, a Montreal, company. Equinox ceased publishing in 2000 and its mailing list was sold to &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot;. Harrowsmith went on to celebrate 30 years of publishing in 2006.

Harrowsmith TV exists as re-runs and Harrowsmith books can still be found. Some titles, such as the &quot;Harrowsmith Cookbook&quot; (three volumes) are still available through Amazon and Firefly Books. Telemedia no longer exists and many of its assets were sold to Transcontinental Media in 2000.

In 2009, &quot;Harrowsmith Country Life&quot; had a circulation of 125,00 and revenues of $3.2 million. In 2010, the Canada Periodical Fund provided a subsidy of $334,231 to the magazine&#x27;s publisher.

In 2011, &quot;Harrowsmith Country Life&quot; published a single issue in March, and in August 2011 the magazine announced that it would cease publication just short of its 35th anniversary issue. It failed to notify subscribers that the magazine would suspend publishing and those subscribers who had paid for their magazines in advance did not have their money refunded.

In the fall of 2012, after obtaining the licensing rights to &quot;Harrowsmith&quot;, Yolanda Thornton, a former employee, revived Harrowsmith magazine starting with its sister publication: &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Truly Canadian Almanac&quot; for 2013. Moongate Inc. (Toronto, ON) which is also owned by Yolanda Thornton assumed the publishing for &quot;Harrowsmith&quot;.

In the spring of 2013, a second issue was added: &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Gardening Digest&quot;. In 2015 the addition of two more titles saw the release of four issues that year: &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Gardening Digest&quot;, &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s My Kind of Town&quot;, &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Homes&quot; and the annual 2015 &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Almanac&quot;. For the 2015 annual fall almanac edition (published September 2014), the title was shortened to &quot;Harrowsmith&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

In 2015 and 2016, &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; embraced the digital market and reached a wider audience with a new format. Two print issues were published (spring and fall) and two online editions (summer and winter) were included in annual subscriptions. &quot;Country Life&quot; was dropped from the title.

In 2017, Harrowsmith redesigned their website to create a virtual community beyond the magazine&#x27;s pages. They released their first full-size magazine Winter edition in response to reader demand.

<doc id="244202" wikidata="Q3101930" url="?curid=244202" title="George Speight">
<text>George Speight (; born 1957), also known by his pseudonym Ilikimi Naitini, is a Fijian businessman and politician who was the leader of the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état, in which he and rebel soldiers from Fiji&#x27;s Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit seized the Fijian Parliament and held Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 35 other MP&#x27;s hostage from 19 May 2000 to 13 July 2000. He was convicted of treason in February 2002 and served a sentence of life imprisonment until receiving a presidential pardon on 18 September 2024.

Speight is the son of politician Sam Speight, the brother of politician Samisoni Tikoinasau and the uncle of rugby players Henry and Sam Speight.

==Personal life==
Speight was born in Naivicula, Fiji, and educated at Suva Grammar School. before studying marketing in Australia and business at Andrews University in the United States. After graduating he worked in Australia as a bank clerk for Metway Bank, and was involved in the Wattle Group pyramid scheme. After returning to Fiji in 1996 he worked as an insurance broker for Heaths Insurance Group. In 1998 he was appointed chair of the state-owned Fiji Pine and Fiji Hardwood Corporation by the Rabuka government, in which his father was serving as a Minister. He was sacked by Heaths in April 1999 following financial irregularities, and from his state appointments by the Labour coalition government in August 1999. It later emerged that he had been paid consultancy fees by American timber company Trans Resource Management, to advocate for them to be granted the right to harvest Fiji&#x27;s mahogany.

In early 2000, just days before the coup, he pleaded not guilty to exchange rate charges and extortion.

== Fiji coup of 2000 ==

On 19 May 2000 a group of armed men led by Speight stormed the Fijian Parliament and took the government hostage. Speight claimed to have seized power on behalf of ethnic Fijians, and purported to have revoked the 1997 constitution and appointed himself interim president and opposition MP Timoci Silatolu as interim Prime Minister. The coup led to rioting and mob-violence in the Fijian capital Suva, and ten days later to the overthrow of President Kamisese Mara by military commander Frank Bainimarama. Bainimarama appointed an all-indigenous Fijian interim government on 3 July, which was rejected by Speight, leading to widespread violence across Fiji.

On 9 July, following prolonged negotiations, Speight signed the Muanikau Accord with the military, agreeing to release the hostages in exchange for an amnesty for himself. All his key demands had been met. The last hostages were released on 13 July.

Following the return of hostages and weapons, Speight and his followers moved to Kalabu Fijian School on the outskirts of Suva, where they continued to lobby over the makeup of the interim government and demand control of key portfolios. When the government rejected his demands, his spokesman Joe Nata threatened civil war. 

==Arrest and trial==
On 26 July Speight and three others were arrested at a military checkpoint following threats to President Josefa Iloilo. The military then stormed his headquarters, killing one person and arresting 369 supporters. On 11 August 2000 he was charged with treason and imprisoned pending trial.

In the 2001 Fijian general election, while still awaiting trial, Speight was elected to Parliament in the Tailevu North Fijian communal seat as a candidate for the Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua. In December 2001 he was dismissed from Parliament for non-attendance.

On 18 February 2002 Speight pleaded guilty to treason and was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment the same day by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Initially imprisoned on Nukulau island, in 2006 he was transferred to the Naboro Maximum Security Prison after Nukulau&#x27;s closure. 

In response to calls for his parole in 2020, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said that there would be no special treatment for him.

On 18 September 2024 Speight was granted a presidential pardon. He was released from prison the next day.

<text>The Futurological Congress () is a 1971 black humour science fiction novel by Polish author Stanisław Lem. It details the exploits of the hero of a number of his stories, Ijon Tichy, as he visits the Eighth World Futurological Congress at a Hilton Hotel in Costa Rica. The book is Lem&#x27;s take on the science fictional trope of an apparently Utopian future that turns out to be an illusion.

== Overview ==
The book opens at the eponymous congress. A riot breaks out, and the hero, Ijon Tichy, is hit by various psychoactive drugs that were put into the drinking water supply lines by the government to pacify the riots. Ijon and a few others escape to the safety of a sewer beneath the Hilton where the congress was being held, and in the sewer he goes through a series of hallucinations and false awakenings, which cause him to be confused about whether or not what&#x27;s happening around him is real. Finally, he believes that he falls asleep and wakes up many years later. The main part of the book follows Ijon&#x27;s adventures in the future world — a world where everyone takes hallucinogenic drugs, and hallucinations have replaced reality.

==Plot summary==
Ijon Tichy is sent to the Eighth World Futurological Congress in Costa Rica by professor Tarantoga. The conference is set to focus on the world&#x27;s overpopulation crisis and ways of dealing with it. It is held at the Costa Rica Hilton in Nounas, which is 164 stories tall. Lem is fiercely satirical from the start, and absurdities abound at the Hilton with its guaranteed &quot;BOMB-FREE&quot; rooms and the extravagances of Tichy&#x27;s suite, which include a palm grove and an &quot;all-girl orchestra [that] played Bach while performing a cleverly choreographed striptease&quot;.

The conference itself is no less absurd. Papers and presenters are too numerous to allow for full presentations. Instead, papers are distributed in hard copy and speakers call out paragraph numbers to call attention to their most salient points.

In the middle of his first night at the conference, Tichy drinks some tap water in his hotel room, and his wild hallucinogenic trip begins, though it never becomes any more or less absurd than the brief glimpse of reality Lem presents in the beginning of the book (if indeed the congress is meant to be reality). He realizes the next day that the government has drugged the public water supply with &quot;benignimizers&quot;, a drug that makes the victim helplessly benevolent. Events spiral out of control at the Hilton, which was already so chaotic that charred corpses from bombing attacks would be covered with tarps where they lay while guests went about their business.

The government ends up bombing the hotel, and Tichy escapes into the sewer, where rats walk around on their hind legs. Tichy is evacuated from the scene by the military: first he escapes by jetpack, only to realise he is hallucinating (falling in the sewer water to find he never left). After returning to reality, he is rescued again and this time evacuated by helicopter, but during his rescue the helicopter crashes, and he awakes in the hospital, where he finds that his brain has been transplanted into the body of an attractive young black woman.

Protesters attack the hospital, and Tichy is nearly killed again. This time when he wakes up, he finds that he has been transplanted into the body of an overweight, red-haired man, however this too is an illusion (again, broken when Tichy falls into the sewer water). When the military once again arrive to rescue everyone in the sewer Tichy refuses to move, believing that it is another illusion. He is then found by counter-revolutionaries, who shoot him. Awaking in another hospital, Tichy&#x27;s mental state grows increasingly fragile as he cannot distinguish reality from hallucination (giving the staff inane nicknames, such as &quot;Hallucinathan&quot; and &quot;Hallucinda&quot;), and the medical staff make the decision to freeze him until a time when medicine can help his condition.

He awakes in the year 2039, and at this point, the novel adopts the format of a journal that Tichy keeps to chronicle his experience in this new world. His future shock is so great that he finds he is being introduced to the world in small stages by the medical staff.

In most regards, this future society is Utopian. Money is no object. One can simply go to the bank and request any sum and borrow it interest-free. There is no effort made to collect the debt, either, as most people take a drug that instills a sense of pride and work-ethic, which would disallow defaulting on the debt.

Tichy learns that there is an inherent bias against defrostees, and that there are a great deal of words that he does not understand. Like cityspeak, and many other sci-fi futuristic languages, it is a mishmash of words with clear enough English roots, though Tichy is mystified by it. Also, mood is highly regulated by drugs. Tichy gets involved with a woman, and during an argument, she deliberately takes a drug called recriminol to make her more combative, which prolongs the tiff.

Following their break-up, Tichy becomes deeply disillusioned with the &quot;psychem&quot; mentality, wherein drugs regulate every waking moment of the day. He resolves to stop taking any drugs and confides to his friend, professor Trottelreiner, that he can&#x27;t stand this new world. Trottelreiner explains that the Narcotics and hallucinogens that Tichy is tired of are trifles compared to &quot;mascons&quot;, which are so powerful that they mask whole swaths of reality.

Trottelreiner explains, &quot;mascon&quot; derives from mask, masquerade, mascara: &quot;By introducing properly prepared mascons to the brain, one can mask any object in the outside world behind a fictitious image—superimposed—and with such dexterity, that the psychemasconated subject cannot tell which of his perceptions have been altered, and which have not. If but for a single instant you could see this world of ours the way it &quot;really&quot; is—undoctored, unadulterated, uncensored—you would drop in your tracks!&quot;

The professor then gives Tichy a flask of &quot;up&#x27;n&#x27;at&#x27;m, one of the vigilanimides, a powerful countersomniac and antipsychem agent. A derivative of dimethylethylhexabutylpeptopeyotine&quot;. With his first sniff of up&#x27;n&#x27;at&#x27;m, Tichy watches as the gilded surroundings of the five-star restaurant they are in evaporates into a dingy concrete bunker, and his stuffed pheasant turns into &quot;the most unappetizing gray-brown gruel, which stuck in globs to my tin — no longer silver — fork&quot;.

But this first dose is just the beginning of Tichy&#x27;s journey. He sees that people do not drive cars or ride in elevators, but they run in the streets and climb the walls of empty elevator shafts, which explains why everyone in this new world is so out of breath. Robots whip people in the street and protect order. Through successive doses of more and more powerful types of up&#x27;n&#x27;at&#x27;m, Tichy sees increasingly horrible visions of the world, climaxing in a frozen horrorscape where people sleep blissfully in the snow, and the police robots are revealed to be people who are convinced that they are robots. The frozen state of the world explains why he has always found the new world to be so cold.

In a state of panic, Tichy realizes that he is &quot;no longer safely inside the illusion, but shipwrecked in reality&quot;, and he desperately seeks the seat of power. He ascends in a skyscraper to encounter his acquaintance George P. Symington Esquire, who sits in a modest office and explains to Tichy that he and a few others employ mascons as a way of maintaining order:
:&quot;The year is 2098 ... with 69 billion inhabitants legally registered and approximately another 26 billion in hiding. The average annual temperature has fallen four degrees. In fifteen or twenty years there will be glaciers here. We have no way of averting or halting their advance — we can only keep them secret.&quot;
:&quot;I always thought there would be ice in hell,&quot; I said.

Tichy realizes his only course of action and tackles Symington, pushing them both out of the window. They plummet to the earth, but instead of colliding with the frozen ground, Tichy splashes into the black, stinking waters of the sewer beneath the Costa Rica Hilton, revealing that his suspicions were right all along: the whole future world he experienced was an illusion. He realizes that it is now the second day of the Eighth World Futurological Congress.

==Cultural influence==
Director Andrzej Wajda wished to adapt the novel into a film, but failed to obtain funding for his project.

Ari Folman&#x27;s film &quot;The Congress&quot; is partially based on the novel &quot;Futurological Congress&quot;. Like Ijon Tichy, the female protagonist is split between delusional and real mental states. The film follows the same general narrative thread but focuses on the struggles of an actress with future technology.

The title of the book was used for one episode of the German TV show &quot;Ijon Tichy: Raumpilot&quot;, which itself was rather based on the story &quot;The Eighth Voyage&quot; from Lem&#x27;s &quot;The Star Diaries&quot;.

<text>A stripper or exotic dancer is a person whose occupation involves performing striptease in a public adult entertainment venue such as a strip club. At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at private events.

Modern forms of stripping minimize the interaction of strippers with customers, reducing the importance of the &quot;tease&quot; in the performance in favor of speed of undress (the &quot;strip&quot;). Not all strippers are comfortable dancing topless or fully nude, but in general, full nudity is common where not prohibited by law. The integration of the burlesque pole as a frequently used prop has shifted the emphasis in the performance toward a more acrobatic, explicit form of expression compared to the slow-developing burlesque style. Most strippers work in strip clubs. A house dancer works for a particular club or franchise, while a feature dancer typically has her own celebrity, touring a club circuit and making appearances. Strippers are often not direct employees of clubs but instead perform as independent contractors.

Before the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences, usually in strip clubs. At the same time, strippers of all genders were dancing in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience. Since the 1970s, mainstream stripping has adopted a greater gender diversity and male strippers have become an established form of entertainment for female audiences. Their performances are usually fully choreographed, involving dance routines and costumes. Certain male and female strippers also perform for LGBT audiences as well as for all genders in bisexual contexts. 

==Work environment==
Strippers perform striptease for a number of reasons, predominantly to make money. The physical attractiveness, sex appeal and techniques of the dancer determines the business the stripper tends to generate. In some localities, strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment. Most of the time dancers have to audition to get the job. Once a dancer has secured the job the formal training is minimal, primarily on the job and provided by more senior dancers. Dancers learn a set of rules, such as never leave money unattended; never leave the club with a customer; and never refuse a table dance.

Touching strippers is not permitted in many localities; few dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. If permitted, during a lap dance the dancer may dance sitting in the customer&#x27;s lap, clothed or topless. In parts of the US, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which the dancers must cover with pasties. The common practice of hiring strippers as contractors rather than full-time employees often leads to job insecurity, unstable pay and a lack of health benefits. Strippers are also sometimes required to pay fees to the club for renting their stage. Strippers typically use make-up, costume, and perfume to enhance their performance.

===In strip clubs===
Strippers most commonly work as providers of live entertainment in strip clubs. House dancers work for a particular club or franchise, while feature dancers usually have celebrity status, touring a club circuit and making live appearances. Porn stars often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base. High-profile adult film performers such as Jenna Haze and Teagan Presley have participated in feature shows throughout the US, as did now-retired stars such as Jenna Jameson. These dancers are not usually direct employees of the club but instead perform as independent contractors for a predetermined house fee.

====Stage performance====
Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence, which repeats during a shift. More informal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers, where they can wander off and on stage at their own will. Feature entertainers have set times for their performance, and are not usually part of the rotation. If a DJ is present, they will emcee the rotation, advertise the feature entertainers performance and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.

====Tip collection====
During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Dancers collect tips from customers either while on stage or after the dancer has finished a stage show and is mingling with the audience. A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar bill folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer&#x27;s garter from the &quot;tip rail&quot;. Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper&#x27;s cleavage from the hand or mouth, or to simply place it or toss it onto the stage. Tipping during a stage performance is prohibited by some clubs due to restrictions in local ordinance or past incidents on the premises. Each club and dancer will have individual tolerance levels for customer interaction including tipping. Some clubs will have multiple stages on the premises that dancers will move between, but typically the dancer would collect for her time on the main stage during a rotation. Tips can also be collected during private dances.

====Private dance====
Where legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as lap dances or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a set amount of time. Private dances in the main club areas most often take the form of table dances, lap and couch dances, and bed dances among others. An &quot;air dance&quot; is a particular form of private dance where little to no contact between the dancer and customer occurs. This class of dance spans the different categories above, and some dancers can perform air dances when more contact-heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for.

Table dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated on the main floor. Table dances also refer to a form of minimal touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s). Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money. These stages are configured for close viewing of the striptease and are known for dancers lowering themselves from the stage onto customers during their set.

Lap dances can be (and are) performed in all manner of seating, ranging from plain stools and kitchen-grade chairs to plush leather armchairs. They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. Occasions for this type of performance are bachelor parties and birthdays in the club among others. Bed dances are designed for the customer to be lying down with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them. Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs, these are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider.

A &quot;champagne room&quot; (also called a &quot;champagne lounge&quot; or &quot;champagne court&quot;) is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentleman&#x27;s clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, the room, which is away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, is well decorated and usually has its own bar. Clubs sell champagne by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer.

===Other locations===
Strippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club.

Adult industry trade shows often have strippers working, though many of them are affiliated with individual companies and not necessarily freelancers. There are also exhibitions, festivals, and competitions where independent strippers perform. Nudes-A-Poppin&#x27; was a popular festival scheduled annually which features both female and male dancers competing in erotic dance.

====Bachelor and bachelorette parties====

A bachelor party may involve activities beyond the usual party and social-gathering ingredients, such as going to a strip club or hiring a stripper to perform in a private setting like a home or hotel. In some traditions, there are hazing-like tests and pranks at the future groom&#x27;s expense. These pranks can involve a stripper if the entertainer is willing. Some women also participate in a similar party to be held for the bride-to-be. This is known as a bachelorette party or Hen party.

====Private parties====
Private parties are popular events for which to hire strippers. There are many entertainment businesses that have strippers contracted for private performances. Some of these companies have a national presence, with strippers contracted in multiple states and some who work regionally over a multi-state area. Strippers will also do side work and handle their own agreements and payment arrangements. Written agreements are atypical in this type of transaction unless a formal, registered business is involved. They could also travel over significant (i.e. flight required) distances for private events and appointments, most of the time passing the cost of travel and accommodations onto the customer. Patrons at the clubs in which the strippers work are a primary source of customers for their work outside the club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party.

==Performance==

While working, a stripper is not necessarily required to remove all of their clothing. Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini. For any type of strip club there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management, and clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning, and advertised services.

===Style of dress===
During a performance, both the breasts and the genitals typically remain covered by revealing clothes, while dancers provide services and entertainment. A female stripper whose upper body is exposed, but whose genitals remain covered during a performance, is said to be topless. Strippers who uncover the genital areas while removing the rest of their clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers work around these constraints by selective uncovering of the vulva, anus, or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing.

In many clubs, entertainers will walk the floor in their revealing clothing. When a stripper performs personal services (such as lap or bed dances) they come into contact with a customer, and are required to remain in their revealing clothing in more restrictive club environments. Private dances in particular are scrutinized to ensure that no club policies or local ordinances are being violated during the performance. The additional clothing also acts as a deterrent to prevent a customer from exceeding the boundaries set by a particular dancer. On 19 June 1964, Carol Doda began go-go dancing topless at the Condor Club on Broadway and Columbus in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. She became the world&#x27;s most famous go-go dancer, and a prototype for the modern stripper, while dancing at the Condor for 22 years.

====Topless====

Women are at times employed in adult-only venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment. Such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs to upmarket cabarets, such as the Moulin Rouge. Topless entertainment may also include competitions such as wet T-shirt contests in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabric—and may end up removing their T-shirts before the audience. Strippers can engage in these alternate topless activities at sanctioned times inside the club or as independent contractors at outside venues. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing topless. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit.

Even the dancers that will go topless have been known to stay covered during a dance during slow periods in the club with few customers. This is particularly true if the customers do not appear to be engaged or actively tipping because they are not being compensated for their time on stage. The practice of topless dancing is banned in many jurisdictions, but strippers have been known to work around the constraints by selectively uncovering her breasts &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; style for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, a bare chest is not considered in the same light and does not face the same legal restrictions. During a show where customer tipping is permitted, most strip clubs limit contact with a dancer&#x27;s breasts to one way—from dancer to customer. Many clubs do not allow any breast contact, and some go so far as to place markers on stage that a dancer is not permitted to cross while nude. This physical separation enforces compliance with the no-touch policy.

====Full nudity====
Strippers are banned from dancing fully nude in many jurisdictions, but many dancers will work around the regulations by selectively uncovering their vulva, anus, or both for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, exposing the penis or anus is equivalent.

Not all strippers are comfortable dancing fully nude. If viewed as a continuum, fewer dancers will dance topless than go-go and fewer still would dance fully nude. It has been reported when in direct competition with more conservative offerings, fully nude formats are seen by customers as a superior enough substitute for them to switch clubs. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit. Still, strippers have been known to dance only at topless clubs because of their desire not to strip completely nude. Some clubs permit both nude stage dancing and fully nude lap dances. Where nude private dances are allowed with contact, some dancers choose to place some type of barrier (cloth or occasionally plastic) over the customer&#x27;s lap as a precautionary measure.

===Customer interaction===
Strippers are focused on making money from customers. Strippers are employed as independent contractors and expected to generate income themselves making the profession similar to a sales job. How dancers go about maximizing revenue varies. For customers they do not already know, dancers use factors such as clothing, shoes, age, and race to determine whom they wish to interact with. Dancers are the primary enablers to encourage potential patrons to spend time in strip clubs. The dancers continually interact with the customers in the club by walking around and attempting to solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the floor of a club to find the most lucrative customer to target.

While clubs can generate revenue through means such as cover charges and drink fees, dancers make most of their profit from giving lap dances or VIP dances where regulations allow. Otherwise, customer tips to dancers from a stage set are their primary form of payment per shift. The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their appearance and personal characteristics. Once the dancer identifies her mark, she approaches and attempts to create social relationship with her customer using tactical interactions and manipulations. Alternatively, customers can make the first move and engage the dancer directly. Strippers appeal to masculine desires, but they can adapt to fit the needs of female patrons to view them as customers. Adapting the experience to the customer is an integral part of exotic dancing.

===Mainstreaming===
In the 21st century, as adult themes and work are becoming more commonplace, more of the population is attracted to this type of work. For example, a University of Leeds study, published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education, revealed that as many as one third of &quot;strip club dancers are students, with many using the cash earned to support themselves throughout their studies&quot; and likely to come from middle class backgrounds. The study also stated that &quot;students were now a &#x27;core supply group into the sex industries&#x27;, with clubs even targeting freshers&#x27; week events with recruitment leaflets.&quot; This is supported by a 2014 story in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; regarding San Francisco strip clubs taking out recruitment ads in the university newspaper for the University of California at Berkeley, &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;. One distinction made is that many view working as a strip club dancer as a short-term means to address financial needs, while others view it as a profession and go on to other types of sex work such as performing in adult films.

===Gender roles===

====Male strippers====
Until the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Male and female strippers also perform for all types of adult audiences.

The modern male stripper show usually involves full nudity, although sometimes they may retain underwear, especially g-strings, bikini briefs or thongs throughout the show, or only remove all clothing for a brief time. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort. Prominent male strip groups include the Dreamboys in the UK &amp; Chippendales in the US.

A male stripper will likely perform at club, bar, workplace or private home with private advanced bookings or ladies nights being prevalent over strip clubs which is the norm for female strippers. This is different from the Chippendales scene that emerged to prominence in the 1980s with today&#x27;s norm being one sole performer, or a series of individual performers rather than a group of strippers.

The social psychologist Richard Tewksbury says that male strippers &#x27;masculinise&#x27; the role; thus are not disempowered in the way that, he asserts, female strippers are.

====Sexuality and gender bias====
Ethnographic research has observed that strippers, regardless of sexual orientation, have a tendency to treat female customers differently than males. Because of the non-physical motivations ascribed to female intimacy, dancers select women to approach who are smiling and sitting comfortably with open body language such as uncrossed arms, actively participating with the crowd, laughing and engaging with fellow customers, and applauding for dancers at the main stage also increase the likelihood they will be approached. Dancers tend to avoid women with unfriendly facial expressions or visibly hostile body language, again regardless of sexual orientation. In order to become approached, men must indicate financial potential through their appearance. Women must demonstrate their good attitude and willingness to participate in club activities. At that point, a woman&#x27;s perceived profitability is also a factor in a dancer&#x27;s decision to approach a female patron. The presence of male companionship has been cited in research as an indicator used by dancers to gauge the profitability of a female once she is perceived to be a customer.

===In popular culture===

The image of strippers has evolved through the late 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and international cultures which embraced Americanized striptease. By the 1980s pole dancing had become popular in America, and the highly sexual imagery associated with the period&#x27;s performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.

====1980s–1990s====
In addition to lesser-known videos, the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative. These included &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), which told the story of blue-collar worker Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Owens (Jennifer Beals), who works as an exotic dancer in a Pittsburgh bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day. &quot;Blaze&quot; (1989) features Lolita Davidovitch as notorious stripper Blaze Starr. Starr herself appears in the film in a cameo role. &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994), directed by Atom Egoyan, is set in a Canadian lap-dance club, and portrays a man&#x27;s (Bruce Greenwood) obsession with a schoolgirl stripper named Christina (Mia Kirshner). &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995) was directed by Paul Verhoeven and starred Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon. &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996), was an adaptation of the novel starring Demi Moore. &quot;The Players Club&quot; (1998) starred LisaRaye McCoy as a girl who becomes a stripper to earn enough money to enter college and study journalism.

In &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; (1997), the character of Lucy Harris (originally portrayed by Linda Eder) works as a prostitute and stripper in a small London club called The Red Rat, where she meets a multi-dimension man named Doctor Henry Jekyll, who turns into his evil persona Mr. Edward Hyde. Lucy performs the song &quot;Bring on the Men&quot; during a show at The Red Rat (which was later replaced with &quot;Good &#x27;n&#x27; Evil&quot; in the Broadway production, some claiming &quot;Bring on the Men&quot; was too &quot;risqué&quot;). In &quot;Neighbours&quot; (1985), the character of Daphne is originally a stripper at Des&#x27;s bucks party, and eventually goes on to marry him. &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (1987–97) often featured Al Bundy, Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy, and the NO MA&#x27;AM crew spending a night at the Nudie Bar. In &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007) business was often conducted at the Bada Bing strip club.

====2000s–present====

In the TV series &quot;La que se avecina&quot;, Lola Reynolds (played by Macarena Gómez), changes her job and works as a stripper after know she will earn more money.

====Music and spoken word====
Strippers have been the inspiration for a number of musical artists, with several of the songs resulting in hit singles. An instrumental, &quot;The Stripper&quot;, was a No. 1 hit on the U.S. pop singles charts for David Rose and His Orchestra in 1962. That song pre-dated the opening of what is considered to be the first modern strip club, Condor Club on Broadway in the U.S. city of San Francisco, California. &quot;Private Dancer&quot; by Tina Turner was an international hit and her second highest-charting single reaching No. 7 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; by Mötley Crüe was also a Top 20 hit on the U.S. charts.

T-Pain had a No. 5 hit on the Billboard chats with &quot;I&#x27;m &#x27;n Luv (Wit a Stripper)&quot; in 2006. Hip hop artist Flo Rida had two No. 1 hits in the U.S. in the 2000s with &quot;Right Round&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;. For both hip-hop artists, the depictions of strippers and expressions of lust are far more explicit than in songs released in earlier music eras. This is not limited to hip-hop, with contemporary songs in other styles of music sharing similar traits. &quot;Worked Up So Sexual&quot; by The Faint is graphic in its depiction of dancer rivalry (&quot;older dancers gag at what new talent seems to mean, smaller tits and younger limbs&quot;) and customers longing to bed them.

Achille Lauro represented San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 with the song &quot;Stripper&quot;.

====Video games====
&quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (1996) is the first video game that includes strippers. The &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series has strippers and strip clubs in many of its games, starting with &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002).

==Legal issues==
===Laws and court cases===
Many U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease, with more being added increasing both complexity of enforcement and impact. For example, the classification of dancers as independent contractors has been challenged in court, successfully in Massachusetts in 2009. One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610, specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the &quot;six foot rule&quot;, copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing.

There are a limited amount of dancers and clubs that condone touching of dancers during private dances, and it is illegal in many U.S. states. In some locales, dancers may give a customer a &quot;lap dance&quot;, whereby the dancer grinds against the customer&#x27;s crotch while they are fully clothed. Other rules forbid &quot;full nudity&quot;. In some parts of the US, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer (though not applied to the exposure of male nipples). In early 2010, the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston, Texas who began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008. The Detroit city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties but kept other restrictions. Both municipalities were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity including prostitution linked to its striptease establishments within their city limits.

In 1930 the Windmill Theatre, opened in London, and began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity. To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer&#x27;s body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage.

In 2010, Iceland outlawed striptease. Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, Iceland&#x27;s prime minister, said: &quot;The Nordic countries are leading the way on women&#x27;s equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.&quot; The politician behind the bill, Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir, said: &quot;It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold.&quot;

===Collective bargaining===
As the sex industry has grown and become a more established sector of national economies, sex workers—strippers included—have mobilized to negotiate or demand workplace rights. One means of collectivization pursued by strippers is the formation of labor unions, which involves formal membership. These strippers&#x27; unions have tended to focus on economic and workers&#x27; rights rather than civil rights, which constitutes a significant departure from the advocacy groups for prostitutes&#x27; rights that began in the 1970s and 1980s. The stigma attached to sex work also creates another obstacle to organization because many strippers and other types of sex workers are uncomfortable with declaring their profession publicly, even in a movement to improve their work environment and benefits.

One potential critique of the organization of strippers and sex workers of other types is that people in management positions in these industries, who are in a position to perpetuate the exploitation that sex workers face, can infiltrate these labor organizations and lobby for the maintenance of a status quo.

====Australia====
The Striptease Artists of Australia formed in 2002. The SAA successfully negotiated an industrial award with the AIRC in 2006. Despite this establishment of an industry-wide minimum standard for labor rights, changes to employment legislature under a Conservative government enabled employers to utilize loopholes such as employing strippers as sub-contractors.

Another group, the Scarlet Alliance, has been involved in advocacy and projects geared towards improving the standing of sex workers since its inception in 1989. While labor rights are an important part of this group&#x27;s agenda, it is not a labor union.

====Britain====
The International Union of Sex Workers is a branch of the GMB, a major general union in Great Britain.

====Canada====
In the 1980s, the Vancouver Exotic Dancers Alliance formed and was active for about a decade. The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour was established in 2003.

====United States====
The Lusty Lady of San Francisco is a notable example of collectivization of strippers in the U.S. When the strippers of the establishment successfully unionized in 1996 through the Erotic Dancers&#x27; Alliance, the owners of the club closed it. In response, the strippers formed a cooperative in 2003 to run the club themselves, renamed the Looking Glass Collective. The Lusty Lady closed in 2013.

In 2023, strippers at the Star Garden Topless Dive Bar in North Hollywood, California voted to unionize and join the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, which made them the only group of unionized strippers in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/union-labor-star-garden&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus (fl. late 3rd to early 2nd century BC) was a Roman military officer and Senator who was elected Roman consul twice, and appointed dictator once. He fought in the Second Punic War and the First and Second Macedonian Wars.

==First consulship and the First Macedonian War==

A member of the Patrician &quot;gens Sulpicia&quot;, Sulpicius Galba was the son of Servius Sulpicius Galba. Although he had held no previous curule magistracy, the crisis of the Second Punic War saw him elected consul in 211 BC, alongside Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus Maximus. Entering his office on the Ides of March, both consuls defended the city of Rome against a surprise attack by the Carthaginian general Hannibal.

Once the immediate crisis abated, and Hannibal retreated back to the south of Italy, provinces were allotted to the consuls. Although both were assigned to Apulia, the Senate, believing that Hannibal no longer posed a grave threat, decreed that one of the consuls only should remain in Apulia, and that the other should be assigned Macedonia for his province. When lots were drawn as to who was to leave Apulia, Sulpicius Galba was appointed proconsul in Macedonia, succeeding Marcus Valerius Laevinus. There he continued fighting the First Macedonian War against Philip V of Macedon.

In early 210 BC, at the end of his consulship, his &quot;imperium&quot; was prolonged for another year, but due to the exaggerated reports which Laevinus had made of his own achievements during his proconsulship, Sulpicius Galba was ordered to disband his army, and retained the command of only one legion and of the &quot;socii navales&quot; (or the local fleet), and he was given a sum of money to ensure his troops were well supplied and provisioned. Given the size of his forces, Sulpicius Galba could not do much in 210 BC, but he did achieve the feat of leading the first Roman fleet into the Aegean Sea and capturing Aegina, which was plundered and given to the Aetolians, who were allied with the Romans. That same year he unsuccessfully tried to relieve Echinus, which was besieged by Philip of Macedon.

For the following year (209 BC), his imperium was again prolonged, with Macedonia and Greece as his provinces. Besides allying themselves with the Aetolian League, the Romans also allied themselves with Attalus I of Pergamon against Philip. Galba provided 1,000 Romans to help the Aetolians in the First Battle of Lamia, while he himself was stationed at Naupactus. When Philip appeared at Dyme on his march against Elis, Galba had landed with fifteen of his ships on the northern coast of the Peloponnesus, where his soldiers were ravaging and plundering the country. However, Philip&#x27;s sudden arrival forced them to return to their camp at Naupactus. When Philip was forced to return to Macedon, which was threatened with an invasion by some neighbouring tribes, Galba sailed to Aegina, where he joined the fleet of Attalus, and where both took up their winter quarters.

In the spring of 208 BC, Galba and Attalus united their fleets of sixty ships in a joint operation, sailed to Lemnos, while Philip pulled together all of his resources to prepare for the expected assault. Attalus attacked Peparethus, and then crossed with Galba over to Nicaea. From there they moved to Euboea, to attack the town of Oreus, which was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, but was betrayed from within and surrendered to Galba. Encouraged by this easy conquest, he also made an attempt to take Chalcis, but found it was too difficult a task. He therefore sailed to Kynos, a port town of Locris. With Attalus being driven back to Asia Minor, Galba returned to Aegina, and remained in Greece for the remainder of his proconsulship, during which time he gave little further assistance to the Aetolian League in their war against Philip. In 205 BC, he was replaced as proconsul in Greece by Publius Sempronius Tuditanus.

==Dictatorship, second consulship and the Second Macedonian War==

In 203 BC, Sulpicius Galba was appointed Dictator, with Marcus Servilius Pulex Geminus appointed his Master of the Horse. Galba was given the task of holding the comitia elections and to possibly prevent the consul Gnaeus Servilius Caepio from crossing over to Africa to confront Hannibal. He also spent the rest of the year investigating cities and prominent individuals who had been alienated by the war with Carthage.

In 200 BC, Sulpicius Galba was elected consul for a second time, this time with Gaius Aurelius Cotta as his colleague. During his consulship, he pushed to secure a renewal of the war against Philip V of Macedon. The people of Rome were very unhappy with a fresh war being undertaken before they had been able to recover from the ravages of the Second Punic War. When the prospect of war was proposed to the Roman assembly, it was rejected. However, Sulpicius reconvened the Assembly and made a speech warning the Roman people against ignoring the threat of Philip V. Fearing that Philip would come to invade Italy like Pyrrhus or Hannibal, the Assembly gave their assent and the Second Macedonian War against Philip was launched. When the consuls drew their lots for their consular commands, Galba once again obtained Macedonia as his province.

Galba was permitted to recruit from the army which Scipio Africanus had brought back from Africa any that were willing to serve again, but none of those veterans were to be compelled. After having selected his men and his ships, he sailed from Brundisium and landed at Apollonia, as per the plan to invade Macedonia from the west. On his arrival he met some Athenian ambassadors, who asked for his protection against the Macedonians, and he at once sent Gaius Claudius Centho with 20 ships and 1,000 men to their assistance. However, as the autumn was approaching when Galba arrived in his province, he took up his winter quarters in the vicinity of Apollonia.

In the spring of 199 BC, Sulpicius Galba advanced with his army through the lands of the Dassaretii, where all the towns and villages along his route surrendered to him, with only a few being taken by force. Both Philip and Galba were ignorant of each other&#x27;s movements, until Macedonian and Roman scouting parties encountered each other by accident, during which a skirmish took place. Near the passes of Eordaia the two armies set up camp some distance from each other, and several minor engagements took place, in one of which the Romans sustained considerable losses. This was followed by a cavalry engagement, in which the Romans were again beaten, but the Macedonians, who were too eager in their pursuit of the enemy, suddenly found themselves attacked on their flanks, and were forced to retreat, during which Philip nearly lost his life.

Immediately after this defeat Philip sent a messenger to Galba to ask for a truce; the Roman commander deferred his decision till the next day, but during the night Philip and his army secretly left the camp, without the Romans knowing in which direction Philip had gone. After having stayed for a few days longer, Galba marched towards Pluvina, and then set up his camp on the banks of the river Osphagus, not far from the place where Philip had established his camp. Here Galba spent his time securing the territory and taking a number of towns, but did not directly engage Philip in battle. In the autumn Galba went back with his army to Apollonia. Although the campaign was considered only a minor military success, it did convince the Aetolians to ally with Rome.

In 198 BC, Sulpicius Galba was replaced in Macedonia by Publius Villius Tappulus, whereupon he returned to Rome. Then in 197 BC, both he and Villius Tappulus were appointed legates under Titus Quinctius Flamininus in Macedonia. In the next year (196 BC), when it was decreed at Rome that ten senatorial commissioners should be sent to help Flamininus settle political issues in Greece, as well as arrange a treaty between Rome and Macedonia, Galba and Tappulus were ordered to act as two of those commissioners. In 195 BC, he may have accompanied Tappulus on his mission to report on the aggressive movements of Antiochus III the Great.

In 193 BC, Galba was sent as an ambassador to Antiochus III along with Villius Tappulus. They first stopped to have discussions with Eumenes II of Pergamon, as they had been ordered, where the king urged the Romans to attack Antiochus at once. While staying at Pergamon, Galba fell ill. Once he had recovered, he and Tappulus travelled to Ephesus, where, instead of Antiochus, they met with Minion, whom the king had granted with full power to negotiate with the Romans. After futile negotiations, Galba returned to Rome, whereupon the Senate decided to declare war against Antiochus III, launching the Roman-Syrian War.

<text>The Culture of Domesticity (often shortened to Cult of Domesticity) or Cult of True Womanhood is a term used by historians to describe what they consider to have been a prevailing value system among the upper and middle classes during the 19th century in the United States. This value system emphasized new ideas of femininity, the woman&#x27;s role within the home and the dynamics of work and family. &quot;True women&quot;, according to this idea, were supposed to possess four cardinal virtues: piety, purity, domesticity, and submissiveness. The idea revolved around the woman being the center of the family; she was considered &quot;the light of the home&quot;.

The women and men who most actively promoted these standards were generally white and Protestant; the most prominent of them lived in New England and the Northeastern United States. Although all women were supposed to emulate this ideal of femininity, black, working class, and immigrant women were often excluded from the definition of &quot;true women&quot; because of social prejudice.

Since the idea was first advanced by Barbara Welter in 1966, many historians have argued that the subject is far more complex and nuanced than terms such as &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; or &quot;True Womanhood&quot; suggest, and that the roles played by and expected of women within the middle-class, 19th-century context were quite varied and often contradictory. For example, it has been argued that much of what had traditionally been considered antifeminist has instead helped lead to feminism.

==Virtues==

Part of the separate spheres ideology, the &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; identified the home as a woman&#x27;s &quot;proper sphere&quot;. Women were supposed to inhabit the private sphere, running the household and production of food (including servants), rearing the children, and taking care of the husband. According to Barbara Welter (1966), &quot;True Women&quot; were to hold and practice the four cardinal virtues:
#Piety – Religion was valued because—unlike intellectual pursuits—it did not take a woman away from her &quot;proper sphere,&quot; the home, and because it controlled women&#x27;s longings.
#Purity – Virginity, a woman&#x27;s greatest treasure, must not be lost until her marriage night, and a married woman had to remain committed only to her husband.
#Submission – True women were required to be as submissive and obedient &quot;as little children&quot; because men were regarded as women&#x27;s superiors &quot;by God&#x27;s appointment&quot;.
#Domesticity – A woman&#x27;s proper place was in the home and her role as a wife was to create a refuge for her husband and children. Cooking, needlework, making beds, and tending flowers were considered naturally feminine activities, whereas reading anything other than religious biographies was discouraged.

According to Welter, an ideal True Woman was &quot;frail&quot;, too mentally and physically weak to leave her home. The care of her home made her feminine, and she depended on men to protect her within the shelter of it. Wilma Mankiller agrees, claiming that a &quot;True Woman&quot; was expected to be delicate, soft, and weak. She was not to engage in strenuous physical activity that would damage her “much more delicate nervous system.&quot;

Frances B. Cogan, however, described an overlapping but competing ideology that she called the ideal of &quot;Real Womanhood,&quot; in which women were encouraged to be physically fit and active, involved in their communities, well educated, and artistically accomplished, although usually within the broader idea that women were best suited to the domestic sphere. The conflation of &quot;Domesticity&quot; and &quot;True Womanhood&quot; can be misleading in that dedication to the domestic sphere did not necessarily imply purity, submission, or weakness.

The characteristics of &quot;True Womanhood&quot; were described in sermons, books, and religious texts as well as women&#x27;s magazines. Prescriptive literature advised women on how to transform their homes into domestic sanctuaries for their husbands and children. Fashion was also stressed because a woman had to stay up to date in order to please her husband. Instructions for seamstresses were often included in magazines. Magazines which promoted the values of the &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; fared better financially than those competing magazines which offered a more progressive view in terms of women&#x27;s roles. In the United States, &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot; were the most widely circulated women&#x27;s magazines and were popular among both women and men. With a circulation of 150,000 by 1860, &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; reflected and supported some of the ideals of the &quot;Cult of True Womanhood.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s paintings and pictures illustrated the four virtues, often showing women with children or behind husbands. It also equated womanhood with motherhood and being a wife, declaring that the &quot;perfection of womanhood (...) is the wife and mother&quot;. The magazine presented motherhood as a woman&#x27;s natural and most satisfying role and encouraged women to find their fulfillment and their contributions to society mainly within the home. At the same time, the long-time editor of &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot;, Sarah Josepha Hale, encouraged women to improve themselves intellectually, to write, and to take action that would improve the moral character of their communities and their nation. Hale promoted Vassar College, advocated for female physicians, and published many of the most important female writers of the 19th century. Frances B. Cogan argued that &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; supported &quot;Real Womanhood&quot; more than &quot;True Womanhood.&quot; Reflecting the ideals of both &quot;True Womanhood&quot; and &quot;Real Womanhood,&quot; &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; considered mothers as crucial in preserving the memory of the American Revolution and in securing its legacy by raising the next generation of citizens.

==Influence on society ==
The Cult of Domesticity affected married women&#x27;s labor market participation in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. &quot;True Women&quot; were supposed to devote themselves to unpaid domestic labor and refrain from paid, market-oriented work. Consequently, in 1890, 4.5% of all married women were &quot;gainfully employed,&quot; compared with 40.5% of single women. Women&#x27;s complete financial dependence upon their husbands proved disastrous, however, when wives lost their husbands through death or desertion and were forced to fend for themselves and their children. This division between the domestic and public spheres had effects on women&#x27;s power and status. In the society as a whole, particularly in political and economic arenas, women&#x27;s power declined. Within the home, however, they gained symbolic power.

The legal implications of this ideology included the passage of protective labor laws, which also limited women&#x27;s employment opportunities outside the home. These laws, as well as subsequent Supreme Court rulings such as &quot;Muller v. Oregon,&quot; were based on the assumption that women&#x27;s primary role was that of mother and wife, and that women&#x27;s non-domestic work should not interfere with their primary function. As a result, women&#x27;s working hours were limited and night work for women was prohibited, essentially costing many female workers their jobs and excluding them from many occupations.

The Cult of Domesticity &quot;privatized&quot; women&#x27;s options for work, for education, for voicing opinions, or for supporting reform. Arguments of significant biological differences between the sexes (and often of female inferiority) led to pronouncements that women were incapable of effectively participating in the realms of politics, commerce, or public service. Women were seen as better suited to parenting. Also, because of the expected behaviors, women were assumed to make better teachers of younger children. Catharine Beecher, who proselytised about the importance of education and parenting, once said, &quot;Woman&#x27;s great mission is to train immature, weak, and ignorant creatures [children] to obey the laws of God... first in the family, then in the school, then in the neighborhood, then in the nation, then in the world&quot;. One of the first public jobs for women was teaching. One estimate says that, with the growth of public education in the northern tier of states, one-quarter of all native-born Massachusetts women in the years between 1825 and 1860 were schoolteachers at some point in their lives.

==Connection to the women&#x27;s movement==

Women&#x27;s rights advocates of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, and Harriet Martineau, were widely accused of disrupting the natural order of things and condemned as unfeminine. &quot;They are only semi-women, mental hermaphrodites,&quot; wrote Henry F. Harrington in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Companion&quot;. However, after the Jacksonian era (1812 to 1850) saw the expansion of voting rights to virtually all white males in the United States, many women believed it was their opportunity for increased civil liberties. Early feminist opposition to many of the values promoted by the Cult of Domesticity (especially concerning women&#x27;s suffrage, political activism, and legal independence) culminated in the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Author and critic John Neal wrote fiction in this period to challenge the tenets of the Cult of Domesticity. His 1859 novel &quot;True Womanhood&quot; is a defense of unmarried women; he states in the preface &quot;that marriage is not always the best thing, nor the one thing needful for [women], whatever it may be to [men].&quot;

Susan M. Cruea postulated that although the &quot;Cult of True Womanhood&quot; set many societal restrictions that took away women&#x27;s working rights and freedom, it nonetheless laid the groundwork for the later development of feminism by crediting women with a moral authority which implicitly empowered them to extend their moral influence outside the home. The ideal woman was expected to act as a status symbol for men and reflect her husband&#x27;s wealth and success, and was to create babies and care for them so that her husband&#x27;s legacy of success would continue, but she was also seen as the &quot;Angel in the House&quot; whose purpose was to guide her family morally. Because of the perceived importance of the role, this ideology was imprinted on girls at a very young age; these girls were taught to value their virginity as the &quot;&#x27;pearl of great price&#x27; which was her greatest asset&quot; and to develop the skills to manage a household and rear children, but they were also taught to see themselves as &quot;a pillar of strength and virtue&quot; who was key not only in providing her husband a proper image but in raising boys who would later have a direct impact on the success of the nation.

During the Progressive Era, the ideal of the New Woman emerged as a response to the Cult of True Womanhood. The New Woman, frequently associated with the suffrage movement, represented an ideal of femininity which was strongly opposed to the values of the Cult of True Womanhood. With demands expressed in the Declaration of Sentiments, written at the Seneca Falls convention in 1848, women finally gained ratification of a constitutional amendment and the right to vote in 1920. After emancipation, these New Women could be identified by as &quot;cigarette-smoking, lipsticked and rouged, jazz-dancing, birth-control-using types known as &#x27;modern girls&#x27; or flappers.&quot;

The Second World War brought about a restructuring of the labor market as women stepped into the war effort on the home front. In the era after the end of the Second World War, many of the ideas of the &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; were stressed again as American society sought to integrate veterans and emphasize the revival of family life. Once the troops returned home, men were encouraged to embrace family life and enter companionship marriages. Veterans returned home to be the head of the family and women who had been involved in high-paying and high-skilled wartime jobs were pushed back into the home. The remaking of the private life was central to this era. Anti-communist sentiments structured much of the American life, emphasizing the free enterprise system which brought about a period of economic prosperity and a consumer culture.

In the 1950s, American television shows often presented series that depicted fictional families in which the mother&#x27;s primary work was to raise the children and run the household. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s spheres were increasingly separated as many families lived in suburban settings, from which men commuted to other cities for work. However, this image of separate spheres disguised the reality that all groups of women continued to work for pay; many did not stop working after the men returned home from the war, they were instead forced into lower-paying jobs. Wages were low and there was little room for advancement. Women that did enter into professional fields were under intense scrutiny for going against the feminine domestic ideal. Despite neo-domestic ideals, many middle-class mothers were burdened by women&#x27;s double shift of working in the home and also a job. At the same time, women had independent lives during the day and were often active in volunteer and community activities, particularly around issues of education, health, children, and welfare. The &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; paved the way for the nuclear family. Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; summed up the expectations of female nature of this time, with a focus on &quot;consumerism, sexualized marriage, and civic activism.&quot; Opposition to those ideas influenced the second wave of feminism.

== Domesticity representation in media ==

Domesticity and media have always been interconnected. One of the first films ever shown was a family centered piece entitled, or &quot;Baby&#x27;s Meal&quot;. This 1895 Lumière brothers film depicted a French couple feeding their infant breakfast. Older content including domestic themes, often served to represent white, nuclear, families and female-centered tropes, the &quot;women&#x27;s weepie&quot; being one common trope, in which mothers sacrificed their own personal identity and well being in order to provide for their children. This is a drastic difference from the &quot;femme fatale&quot; trope which demonstrates a rejection of domestic life and family connection in favor of romance, sexuality, danger, and drama. There are more inclusive representations of domesticity in today&#x27;s media versus the more limited, heteronormative examples of the past.

Domesticity has long served as a home base for discussions on polarizing subjects. Sexuality, politics, gender, and race are all topics seen and discussed in domestic-centric content. It is also seen across many genres, being well represented in comedy, drama, talk, reality television, and horror. Family life and relationships, in addition to other domestic themes, are amongst the most popular with consumers as well. This is proven by programming such as Leave It to Beaver, which presented a 20th-century view of the nuclear family, and &quot;Modern Family,&quot; which showed a wider variety of family structures and was one of the highest grossing shows during its run on air.

With the entrance of women into the workforce, the increase of divorce rates, and rise of single parents, themes of typical domesticity became less widely applicable. Shows like &quot;The Fosters,&quot; which highlighted blended families, became more common.

With lowering societal expectations of the nuclear family being the common end goal of most people, Western media made way for the depiction of &quot;chosen families&quot;, or non-biological groups who provide support in a familial way. These groups are commonly seen in, but not limited to, LGBTQ+-centered programming. Examples include the central friendship group of &quot;Friends&quot; or even the science fiction show &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, where the main character takes in a foreign creature as his own. The genre of science fiction is far from removed from including its own domestic themes; an example would be &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, where the main character of Buffy is framed as a tough, strong, action hero who also values the domestic femininity of being a young woman.

In another contrast from the nuclear family structure, there is much more representation of people of color in modern domestic media content, though this is often limited and stereotypical in presentation, particularly for women of color. Today, more powerful, successful, black families are at the core of some of the most popular modern programs such as &quot;Empire&quot;.

LGBTQ+ themes are also expanding the present media displays of domesticity. Programming such as &quot;Queer Eye&quot; demonstrate this through a blend of domestic representation such as home design, self presentation, and interracial queer representation.

The heteronormative qualities displayed in early domestic values were also challenged in the show &quot;Transparent&quot;, where one parent reveals they are transgender and decides to transition whilst managing a family life. Representation of transgender identities are becoming more frequent in media. Even family lifestyle network, TLC airs a popular show, &quot;I Am Jazz&quot; about a transgender teenager and her family. Though the introduction of a transgender lead may be a relatively new idea, the themes discussed are no different than seen in most family programming, such as dating, crushes, school, and dealing with sibling relationships.

Workplaces are another common setting in which similar themes are seen. Coworkers often behave in a familial manner and have unique interpersonal connections. This interpretation of domesticity has become permanently embedded into popular culture with cult favorites like &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, &quot;Grey’s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Mad Men&quot;. With households working more combined hours than ever before, workplaces sometimes serve as social support, especially when home life is less than ideal. Classic domestic themes like relationship disputes or love do not have to be limited to the biological family.

In a large departure from the traditional domestic value of purity, modern media has shone a light upon the traditionally taboo topic of teen pregnancy. The emergence of this theme was seen in films such as &quot;Juno&quot;, or the controversial MTV series 16 and Pregnant; which, amongst the topic of teen pregnancy, also discussed safe sex and adoption. The show, whilst modern in its nature, also connects to traditional domestic themes such as purity. It promotes the importance of young women patrolling their bodies and the notion of being a good mother as most important over education or social activities.

Within the intersection of domesticity and media, traditional domestic values are not erased, but rather expanded to include modern representations. Home life, sexuality, and independence are now being reflected by the diversity in media rather than restricted to limited representation.

<text>In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability to physically transform oneself through unnatural means. The idea of shapeshifting is found in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest existent literature and epic poems such as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The concept remains a common literary device in modern fantasy, children&#x27;s literature and popular culture. Examples of shapeshifters are vampires and werewolves.

==Folklore and mythology==
Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), ichchhadhari naag (shape-shifting cobra) of India, shapeshifting fox spirits of East Asia such as the huli jing of China, the obake of Japan, the Navajo skin-walkers, and gods, goddesses and demons and demonesses such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.

The prefix &quot;were-&quot; comes from the Old English word for &quot;man&quot;.

While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.

===Greco-Roman===

Examples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Circe&#x27;s transforming of Odysseus&#x27; men to pigs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, and Apuleius&#x27;s Lucius becoming a donkey in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;. Proteus was known among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus captured him to obtain information, and they succeeded only by holding on through his many transformations. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason.

The Oceanid Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, her pride led Zeus to trick her into transforming into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built an armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father&#x27;s head, fully grown, and in battle armor.

In Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.
* Zeus transformed King Lycaon and his children into wolves (hence lycanthropy) as a punishment for either killing Zeus&#x27; children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon&#x27;s own murdered son Nyctimus, depending on the exact version of the myth.
* Ares assigned Alectryon to keep watch for Helios the sun god during his affair with Aphrodite, but Alectryon fell asleep, leading to their discovery and humiliation that morning. Ares turned Alectryon into a rooster, which always crows to signal the morning and the arrival of the sun.
* Demeter transformed Ascalabus into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter Persephone. She also turned King Lyncus into a lynx for trying to murder her prophet Triptolemus.
* Athena transformed Arachne into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods. She also turned Nyctimene into an owl, though in this case it was an act of mercy, as the girl wished to hide from the daylight out of shame of being raped by her father.
* Artemis transformed Actaeon into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his hunting dogs.
* Galanthis was transformed into a weasel or cat after interfering in Hera&#x27;s plans to hinder the birth of Heracles.
* Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions after making love in a temple dedicated to Zeus or Cybele.
* Io was a priestess of Hera in Argos, a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to escape detection.
* Hera punished young Tiresias by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man.
* King Tereus, his wife Procne, and her sister Philomela were all turned into birds (a hoopoe, a swallow and a nightingale respectively), after Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue, and in revenge she and Procne served him the flesh of his murdered son Itys (who in some variants is resurrected as a goldfinch).
* Callisto was turned into a bear by either Artemis or Hera for being impregnated by Zeus.
* Selene transformed Myia into a fly when she became a rival for the love of Endymion.

While the Greek gods could use transformation punitively – such as Medusa, who turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse (raped in Ovid&#x27;s version) with Poseidon in Athena&#x27;s temple – even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:
* Danaë as a shower of gold
* Europa as a bull
* Leda as a swan
* Ganymede, as an eagle
* Alcmene as her husband Amphitryon
* Hera as a cuckoo
* Aegina as an eagle or a flame
* Persephone as a serpent
* Io, as a cloud
* Callisto as either Artemis or Apollo
* Nemesis (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape Zeus&#x27; advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which Helen of Troy was found.
Vertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona&#x27;s orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.

In other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Corone into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods&#x27; shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.

In one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.

Clytie was a nymph who loved Helios, but he did not love her back. Desperate, she sat on a rock with no food or water for nine days looking at him as he crossed the skies, until she was transformed into a purple, sun-gazing flower, the heliotropium.

As a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.

Eos, the goddess of the dawn, secured immortality for her lover the Trojan prince Tithonus, but not eternal youth, so he aged without dying as he shriveled and grew more and more helpless. In the end, Eos transformed him into a cicada.

In some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower.
Sometimes metamorphoses transform objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon&#x27;s teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone into a living woman.

===British and Irish===
Fairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, some having only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called &quot;glamour&quot;, to create illusions, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms. But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.

Witches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.

Many British fairy tales, such as &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; and &quot;The Black Bull of Norroway&quot;, feature shapeshifting.

====Celtic mythology====
Pwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn&#x27;s shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll&#x27;s so that they could trade places for a year and a day.

Llwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turns himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.

Math fab Mathonwy and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.

Gilfaethwy raped Goewin, Math fab Mathonwy&#x27;s virgin footholder, with help from his brother Gwydion. As punishment, Math turned them into different types of animals for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow, and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar, and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.

Gwion, having accidentally taken the wisdom from a potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled from her through a succession of changes, which she answered with changes of her own. This ended when he turned into a grain of corn and she turned into a hen and ate him. She became pregnant, and he was reborn as a baby. He grew up to be the bard Taliesin. In the Book of Taliesin, he mentions many forms which he is able to take, including that of lantern-light.

Tales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact in human guise with people for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist&#x27;s foundation myths include a union between the founder of the clan and a shape-shifting selkie. Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In &quot;The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry&quot; the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.

Scottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each-uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man. Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales.
Perhaps the best-known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise, in the &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot;, Fuamnach jealously turns Étaín into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Partholón&#x27;s settlement of Ireland. In his centuries-long life, he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk, and finally a salmon before being eaten and (as in the Wooing of Étaín) reborn as a human.

The Púca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.

Sadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill, was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich when she spurned his amorous interests.

===Norse and Teutonic===
There is a significant amount of literature about shapeshifters that appear in a variety of Norse tales.

In the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th-century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin&#x27;s steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir.

Svipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdagr, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went. In the &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Freyja transformed her protégé Óttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.

The Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir&#x27;s mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfjötli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves.

The dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan.

Fafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant, or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants, he transformed into a dragon—a symbol of greed—while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, Ótr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.

In Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known by the name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of huge half-human and half-wolf monsters that stalked the night in search of human or animal prey. If a woman gives birth at midnight and stretches the membrane that envelopes the child when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras.

The Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Hulder.

Gunnhild, Mother of Kings (&quot;Gunnhild konungamóðir&quot;) (c. 910  –  c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers – including the power of shapeshifting 
and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel &quot;Mother of Kings&quot; by Poul Anderson, which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities.

In the Finnish epic poem Kalevala of ancient folklore, Louhi, Mistress of the North, attacks Väinämöinen in the form of a giant eagle with her troops on her back as she tries to steal Sampo.

===Indian===
*Ichchhadhari naag: A common male cobra will become an &quot;ichchhadhari naag&quot; and a common female cobra will become an &quot;ichchhadhari naagin&quot; after 100 years of tapasya (penance). After being blessed by Lord Shiva, they attain a human form of their own and have the ability to shapeshift into any living creature, they can live for more than a hundred years without getting old.
*Yoginis were associated with the power of shapeshifting into female animals.
*In the Indian fable &quot;The Dog Bride&quot; from &quot;Folklore of the Santal Parganas&quot; by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.
*In Kerala, there was a legend about the &quot;Odiyan&quot; clan, who in Kerala folklore are men believed to possess shapeshifting abilities and can assume animal forms. Odiyans are said to have inhabited the Malabar region of Kerala before the widespread use of electricity.

===Armenian===
In Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the &quot;Nhang&quot;, a serpentine river monster that can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial &quot;Shahapet&quot;, a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.

===Philippines===
Philippine mythology includes the Aswang, a vampiric monster capable of transforming into a bat, a large black dog, a black cat, a black boar, or some other form to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as the Kapre, the Tikbalang, and the Engkanto, which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called &quot;&quot;anting-anting&quot; or &quot;birtud&quot;&quot; in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, &quot;Chonguita the Monkey Wife&quot;, a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.

===Tatar===
Tatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men to have children.

===Chinese===

Chinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit that usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. &quot;Madame White Snake&quot; is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials she and her husband faced.

===Japanese===

In Japanese folklore obake are a type of yōkai with the ability to shapeshifting. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina, and the tanuki.

===Korean===
Korean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho. The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).

===Somali===

In Somali mythology &quot;Qori ismaris&quot; (&quot;One who rubs himself with a stick&quot;) was a man who could transform himself into a &quot;Hyena-man&quot; by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.

===Southern Africa===
ǀKaggen is a demi-urge and folk hero of the ǀXam people of southern Africa. He is a trickster god who can shape shift, usually taking the form of a praying mantis but also a bull eland, a louse, a snake, and a caterpillar.

=== Native American ===
A Pukwudgie is a human-like creature from Wampanoag folklore said to appear and disappear at will, and shapeshift.

=== South American ===
Amazon river dolphins are curious and lack of fear of foreign objects, are apex predators, and the male Amazon river dolphins are very physically aggressive during their mating period, particularly around the courtship practice of object carrying.

Amazon river dolphins, known by the natives as the boto, encantados or toninhas, are very prevalent in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are frequently characterized in mythology with superior musical ability, seductiveness and love of sex, resulting in illegitimate children, and attraction to parties. Despite the fact that the Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth which is also without pain or death, they crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.

Transformation into human form is said to be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not disappear with the shapeshift.

Besides the ability to shapeshift into human form, encantados frequently wield other magical abilities, such as controlling storms, hypnotizing humans into doing their will, transforming humans into encantados, and inflicting illness, insanity, and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations.

Along with shapeshifting, kidnapping is also a common theme in such folklore. Encantados are said to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, children born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among people who live near the Amazon River that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, but the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time. The myth is suggested to have arisen in part because dolphin genitalia bear a resemblance to those of humans. Others believe the myth served (and still serves) as a way of hiding the incestuous relations which are quite common in some small, isolated communities along the river.
Legend also states that &quot;if a person makes eye contact with an Amazon river dolphin, they will have lifelong nightmares&quot;.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
The Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic.

===Mapuche (Argentina and Chile)===

The name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): &quot;Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)&quot;, from &quot;nahuel&quot;, &quot;puma (or jaguar)&quot;, and &quot;huapí&quot;, &quot;island&quot;. There is, however, more to the word &quot;Nahuel&quot; – it can also signify &quot;a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma&quot; (or jaguar).

===Slavic mythology===
In Slavic mythology, one of the main gods Veles was a shapeshifting god of animals, magic and the underworld. He was often represented as a bear, wolf, snake or owl. He also became a dragon while fighting Perun, the Slavic storm god.

===Folktales===

* In the Finnish tale &quot;The Magic Bird&quot;, three young sorceresses attempt to murder a man who keeps reviving. His revenge is to turn them into three black mares and have them harnessed to heavy loads until he is satisfied.
* In &quot;The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh&quot;, a Northumbrian legend from about the thirteenth century, Princess Margaret of Bamburgh is transformed into a dragon by her stepmother; her motive sprung, like Snow White&#x27;s stepmother&#x27;s, from the comparison of their beauty.
* In Child ballad 35, &quot;Allison Gross&quot;, the title witch turns a man into a wyrm for refusing to be her lover. This is a motif found in many legends and folktales.
* In the German tale &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Bridegroom&quot;, recorded by folklorist and ethnographer Gustav Jungbauer, the third of three sons of a farmer, Hansl, is forced to marry a frog, which eventually turns out to be a beautiful woman transformed by a spell.
* In some variants of the fairy tales, both &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; or more commonly &quot;The Frog Princess&quot; and Beast, of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, are transformed as a form of punishment for some transgression. Both are restored to their true forms after earning a human&#x27;s love despite their appearance.
* In the most famous Lithuanian folk tale &quot;Eglė the Queen of Serpents&quot;, Eglė irreversibly transforms her children and herself into trees as a punishment for betrayal while her husband is able to reversibly morph into a serpent at will.
* In &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, the hero is transformed into a bear by his wicked stepmother, who wishes to force him to marry her daughter.
* In &quot;The Marmot Queen&quot; by Italo Calvino, a Spanish queen is turned into a rodent by Morgan le Fay.
* In The Mare of the Necromancer, a Turin Italian tale by Guido Gozzano, the Princess of Corelandia is turned into a horse by the baron necromancer for refusing to marry him. Only the love and intelligence of Candido save the princess from the spell.
* The White Doe, a French tale written by Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy, describes the transformation of Princess Desiree into a doe by a jealous fairy.
* From a Croatian book of tales, Sixty Folk-Tales from Exclusively Slavonic Sources by A. H. Wratislaw, the fable entitled &quot;The she-wolf&quot; tells of a huge she-wolf with a habit of turning into a woman from time to time by taking off her skin. One day a man witnesses the transformation, steals her pelt and marries her.
* &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Sons&quot; is a Finnish story of two brothers, one of whom tries to win the hand of the tsar&#x27;s wicked daughter. The girl does not like her suitor and endeavors to have him killed, but he turns her into a beautiful mare which he and his brother ride. In the end he turns her back into a girl and marries her.
* In &quot;Dapplegrim&quot;, if the youth found the transformed princess twice, and hid from her twice, they would marry.
* In literary fairy tale &quot;The Beggar Princess&quot;, to save her beloved prince, Princess Yvonne fulfills the tasks of cruel king Ironheart and is changed into an old woman.
* &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, one of China&#x27;s Four Great Classical Novels, greatly features shapeshifting, as many gods, demons, and other mythical beings are capable of the act. The most famous case would be the Monkey King, a mischievous trickster who often utilizes his power of 72 transformations to thwart his foes.

==Themes==
Shapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast&#x27;s transformation in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; indicates Belle&#x27;s ability to accept him despite his appearance.

When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is &quot;bound&quot; to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.

Examples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear&#x27;s shape (as in &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;) is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear&#x27;s shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in &quot;The She-Bear&quot;) escapes with her new shape. In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard&#x27;s mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example of a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis.
Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;The Canary Prince&quot; is a Rapunzel variant in which shape-shifting is used to gain access to the tower.

===Punitive changes===
In many cases, imposed forms are punitive. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths.

===Transformation chase===
In many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, &quot;The Twa Magicians&quot; or &quot;Farmer Weathersky&quot;, a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.

The Grimm Brothers&#x27; fairy tale &quot;Foundling-Bird&quot; contains this as the bulk of the plot. In the Italian Campania Fables collection of &quot;Pentamerone&quot; by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.

In other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale &quot;The Master Maid&quot;, where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles. This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.

In fairy tales of the Aarne–Thompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in &quot;The Grateful Prince&quot;, &quot;King Kojata&quot;, &quot;Foundling-Bird&quot;, &quot;Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, or &quot;The Two Kings&#x27; Children&quot;) or an obstacle chase (as in &quot;The Battle of the Birds&quot;, &quot;The White Dove&quot;, or &quot;The Master Maid&quot;).

In a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus&#x27;s shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe, and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her &quot;Riddle-Master trilogy&quot;: a shape-shifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.

===Powers===
One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.

In many fairy tales, the hero&#x27;s talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in &quot;The Three Enchanted Princes&quot; and &quot;The Death of Koschei the Deathless&quot;, the hero&#x27;s three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.

In an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, can change his appearance and manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens and live together for eternity.

===Bildungsroman===
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; has been interpreted as a young woman&#x27;s coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.

===Needed items===

Some shapeshifters can change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In &quot;Bisclavret&quot; by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. However, the most common use of this motif is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese &quot;tennin&quot;.

Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf, in &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;, included a version of the story with the typical elements (fisherman sees mermaids dancing on an island and steals the sealskin of one of them, preventing her from becoming a seal again, so that he could marry her) and linked it to the founding of the city of Stockholm.

===Inner conflict===
The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the &quot;liberation&quot; theme, as in Dr Jekyll&#x27;s transformation into Mr. Hyde.

===Usurpation===
Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret&#x27;s wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;, changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer to put her daughter in the queen&#x27;s place. In the Korean &quot;Transformation of the Kumiho&quot;, a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transforms itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;, when two children flee from their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. &quot;The Six Swans&quot; are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.

===Ill-advised wishes===
Many fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them. At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. &quot;Hans My Hedgehog&quot; was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his &quot;Pentamerone&quot; the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his &quot;Italian Folktales&quot;, a girl born as an apple.

Sometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in a transformed birth. In &quot;Prince Lindworm&quot;, the woman eats two onions but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In &quot;Tatterhood&quot;, a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting in her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.

Less commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. &quot;The Seven Ravens&quot; are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them. In &quot;Puddocky&quot;, when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.

===Monstrous bride/bridegroom===

Such wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride&#x27;s revulsion to marrying a stranger is symbolized by his bestial form.

The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was halfway, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In &quot;Tatterhood&quot;, Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn&#x27;t ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, &quot;Kemp Owyne&quot;, where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.

Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. &quot;Hans My Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;The Donkey&quot; and &quot;The Pig King&quot; fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in &quot;Prince Lindworm&quot;, the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.

In some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals&#x27; skins. In &quot;The Brown Bear of Norway&quot;, &quot;The Golden Crab&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Snake&quot; and some variants of &quot;The Frog Princess&quot;, burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.

===Death===
Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form. In &quot;The Famous Flower of Serving-Men&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In &quot;The White and the Black Bride&quot; and &quot;The Three Little Men in the Wood&quot;, the murdered – drowned – true bride reappears as a white duck. In &quot;The Rose Tree&quot; and &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot;, the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form.

In some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in &quot;Beauty and Pock Face&quot;, &quot;A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers&quot;, and &quot;The Boys with the Golden Stars&quot;. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.

Similarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In &quot;The Wounded Lion&quot;, the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into the water. Less drastic but no less fatal, the fox in &quot;The Golden Bird&quot;, the foals in &quot;The Seven Foals&quot;, and the cats in &quot;Lord Peter&quot; and &quot;The White Cat&quot; tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape. In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla&#x27;s father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.

Eustace&#x27;s transformation is not strictly a punishment – the change simply reveals the truth of his selfishness — and it is reversed after he repents with the later change in his moral nature. Rabadash is allowed to reverse his transformation, providing he does so in a public place, so that his former followers will know that he had been a donkey. He is warned that, if he ever leaves his capital city again, he will become a donkey permanently, and this prevents him from leading further military campaigns.

<doc id="244225" wikidata="Q180306" url="?curid=244225" title="Duke of Leinster">
<text>Duke of Leinster (; ) is a title and the premier dukedom in the Peerage of Ireland. The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Leinster are: Marquess of Kildare (1761), Earl of Kildare (1316), Earl of Offaly (1761), Viscount Leinster, of Taplow in the County of Buckingham (1747), Baron of Offaly (c. 1193), Baron Offaly (1620) and Baron Kildare, of Kildare in the County of Kildare (1870). The viscounty of Leinster is in the Peerage of Great Britain, the barony of Kildare in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and all other titles in the Peerage of Ireland. The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Duke of Leinster is &quot;Marquess of Kildare&quot;. The Duke of Leinster is the head of the House of Kildare.

The 3rd Duke of Schomberg, General and K.G. (1641–1719), was created The 1st Duke of Leinster in 1691. However, that creation became extinct upon Schomberg&#x27;s death in July 1719. For the second creation, it was granted to James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster, who married to Lady Emily Lennox, the great-granddaughter of King Charles II of the Royal House of Stuart.

The family seat of the current Duke of Leinster is now Oakley Park, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. He succeeded as 9th Duke of Leinster, 9th Marquess of Kildare, 28th Earl of Kildare, 9th Earl of Offaly, 9th Viscount Leinster of Taplow, 14th Baron Offaly, 6th Baron Kildare, and as the Premier Duke, Marquess and Earl in the Peerage of Ireland.

==Earls of Kildare from 1316==
This branch of the Cambro Norman FitzGerald/FitzMaurice dynasty, which came to Ireland in 1169, were initially created Earls of Kildare. The earldom was created in 1316 for John FitzGerald. Two senior FitzGeralds, Garret Mór FitzGerald and his son, Garret Óg FitzGerald served as Lords Deputy of Ireland, the representative of the Lord of Ireland (the King of England) in Ireland. The tenth earl, Thomas FitzGerald, known as Silken Thomas, was attainted and his honours were forfeit in 1537. In 1554, Thomas&#x27;s half-brother and only male heir, Gerald FitzGerald, was created Earl of Kildare in the Peerage of Ireland. He was subsequently restored to the original letters patent in 1569, as 11th earl. The second (1554-created) earldom became extinct in 1599, although the original earldom survived.

== Dukes of Leinster from 1766 ==
The family was originally based in Maynooth Castle in Maynooth in County Kildare. In later centuries the family owned estates in County Waterford with their country residence being a Georgian house called Carton House which had replaced the castle in County Kildare. In Dublin, the Earl built a large townhouse residence on the southside of Dublin called &quot;Kildare House&quot;. When the Earl was awarded a dukedom and became &quot;Duke of Leinster&quot;, the house was renamed Leinster House. One of its occupants was Lord Edward FitzGerald, who became an icon for Irish nationalism through his involvement with the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which ultimately cost him his life.

Leinster House was sold by the Leinsters in 1815. After nearly a century as the headquarters of the Royal Dublin Society, which held its famed &quot;Spring Show&quot; and &quot;Horse Show&quot; in its grounds, Oireachtas Éireann, the two chamber parliament of the new Irish Free State, rented Leinster House in 1922 to be its temporary parliament house. In 1924 it bought the building for parliamentary use. It has remained the parliament house of the Irish state.

The Dukes of Leinster had by the early 20th century lost all their property and wealth. Their Carton House seat was sold (though one of Ireland&#x27;s most historic buildings with perfectly preserved 18th century grounds, it was controversially turned into a hotel and golf course in the late 1990s by the current owner in an act condemned by environmentalists), as later on was their other residence in Waterford. The family now live in a smaller property in Ramsden, Oxfordshire.

===Title dispute===
A controversial claim by claimants who say they are descended from the 5th Duke, which is reported to have been largely debunked by Michael Estorick in 1981, was made in 2006 and subsequently failed.

In 2005, a claim was filed with the Department of Constitutional Affairs by Theresa Pamella Caudill, daughter of Eleanor and Maurice F. &quot;Desmond&quot; FitzGerald, on behalf of her nephew, a California builder, Paul FitzGerald, as claimant to be the rightful Duke of Leinster. FitzGerald was claimed to be the grandson of Major Lord Desmond FitzGerald (1888–1916), the second son of The 5th Duke of Leinster, who was recorded as having been killed in action during the First World War, while serving with the Irish Guards. When Maurice, 6th Duke of Leinster, died, mad and childless, in February 1922, the Leinster dukedom and its considerable wealth and estates devolved upon his youngest brother, Lord Edward FitzGerald, who succeeded as 7th Duke. However, Paul FitzGerald&#x27;s supporters claim that Lord Desmond faked his death and emigrated to California, by way of Winnipeg, Canada, where he lived until his death in 1967. It was further claimed by Mrs Caudill that a package of documents, witnessed by Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), Sir Edgar Vincent, and Lord Feversham, had been lodged by her father with the Crown Office of the House of Lords in 1929, and the family had been denied access to them. Mrs Caudill believed the documents included evidence that her father agreed to relinquish the title for one generation but made it clear it was to be passed down to his son, her brother Leonard FitzGerald. Instead, it was passed down through her father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s family. It was alleged that an archivist had acknowledged the package had once existed, but the official line was that it was now lost.

In February 2006, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Lord Chancellor (2003–2007), and Harriet Harman, Minister of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, considered this claim. The claim was dismissed by Lord Falconer of Thoroton, despite a 30-year campaign by Paul FitzGerald&#x27;s family reputedly costing £1.3 million. The Lord Chancellor adjudicated that the title was to remain with the existing holder, Maurice FitzGerald. Paul FitzGerald has a right of appeal against the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s verdict by petitioning the monarch.

In 2010, however, DNA evidence was presented that indicates that Paul FitzGerald is related to the wife of the 5th Duke, the former Lady Hermione Duncombe. As reported in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;,

With the help of Dunfermline-based genealogist Lloyd Pitcairn, Mrs FitzGerald Caudill [Paul FitzGerald&#x27;s aunt] traced Maud Crawford, the grand-daughter of Lady Hermione&#x27;s younger sister Urica Duncombe.

The results of the tests found that it was &quot;41 times more probable&quot; that Ms Crawford and Paul FitzGerald were extremely closely related than were from different families. The proof that Paul FitzGerald is related to the titled family is the first DNA evidence ever produced in the case, and it strongly supports Mrs Fitz-Gerald Caudhill&#x27;s long-held claim suggesting that her mysterious father was the son of Lady Hermione, the wife of the fifth Duke of Leinster.
Theresa Pamella Caudill died on July 25, 2015.

It had also previously been alleged that Edward FitzGerald, who succeeded as 7th Duke, was the biological son of the 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857–1937). Were this to be established, then neither the present Duke nor any other descendant of his grandfather, the 7th Duke, would be a legitimate heir of the 1st Duke of Leinster.

==Family tree==
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the Dukes of Leinster derives from the legend that John FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare, as a baby in Woodstock Castle, was trapped in a fire when a pet monkey rescued him. The FitzGeralds then adopted a monkey as their crest (and later supporters) and occasionally use the additional motto &quot;Non immemor beneficii&quot; (Not forgetful of a helping hand). The motto &quot;Crom A Boo&quot; comes from the medieval Croom Castle and &quot;Abu&quot;, meaning &quot;up&quot; in Irish; &quot;Crom Abu&quot; was the FitzGeralds&#x27; medieval warcry. Crom (Croom) and Shanet (Shanid) were two castles about 16 miles apart in County Limerick, one being the seat of the Geraldines of Kildare, and the other that of the Geraldines of Desmond, whose distinctive war cries were accordingly &quot;Crom-a-boo&quot; and &quot;Shanet-a-boo&quot;. In 1495 an act of Parliament was passed (10 Hen. 7. c. 20 (Ir)) &quot;to abolish the words Crom-a-boo and Butler-a-boo.&quot; The word &quot;Abu&quot; or &quot;Aboo&quot;, an exclamation of defiance, was the usual termination of the war cries in Ireland, as in &quot;a&#x27; buaidh&quot;, &quot;to victory!&quot; Saint Patrick&#x27;s Saltire, a red saltire on a white field, may have been adapted from the duke&#x27;s arms on the 1783 creation of the Order of Saint Patrick, of which the 2nd Duke of Leinster was the senior founder knight.

*Escutcheon: Argent a saltire gules.
*Crest: A monkey statant proper environed about the middle with a plain collar and chained or.
*Supporters: Two monkeys, environed and chained as in the crest.
*Motto: &quot;Crom a boo&quot; (Now it would be spelt &quot;Crom Abu&quot;). In English, &quot;Up Croom&quot;, or &quot;Croom to victory&quot;.

<doc id="244230" wikidata="Q2746331" url="?curid=244230" title="More Irish than the Irish themselves">
<text>&quot;More Irish than the Irish themselves&quot; (; ) is a phrase used in Irish historiography to describe a phenomenon of cultural assimilation in late medieval Norman Ireland.

==History==
The descendants of Anglo-Norman lords who had settled in Ireland in the 12th century had been significantly Gaelicised
by the end of the Middle Ages, forming septs and clans after the indigenous Gaelic pattern, and became known as the Gall or &quot;Old English&quot; (contrasting with the &quot;New English&quot; arriving with the Tudor conquest of Ireland). The Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, complained that
&quot; ... now many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies&quot;.

In 1596 the Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser (c. 1552–13 January 1599) whilst employed as part of the English administration in Ireland, paraphrased the saying in his controversial treatise, &quot;A View of the Present State of Irelande&quot;. In the treatise, the characters Eudoxus and Irenius discuss how those sent over by King Henry II of England to colonise Ireland, eventually became more Irish in outlook than the Irish themselves 

The phrase (in Latin) was used by the Irish priest and historian John Lynch (c1599–1677) in his work &quot;Cambrensis Eversus&quot;. He was strongly influenced by the writings of the historian Geoffrey Keating (1569 – c. 1644), whose &quot;History of Ireland&quot; he translated into Latin. &quot;Cambrensis Eversus&quot; was translated from the Latin, with notes and observations, by Theophilus O&#x27;Flanagan, Dublin, 1795.

==Eighteenth-century use==
John Henry Wilson, in his &quot;Sketch of Jonathan Swift&quot; (1804), wrote that Swift used the phrase (&quot;Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis&quot;) in a discussion with his landlord.

==Nineteenth-century use==

The phrase remained in use by romantic nineteenth-century nationalists to promote the common Irishness of &#x27;Planter and Gael&#x27;. An example is found in the 1844 poem by the Young Irelander, Thomas Davis, called &#x27;The Geraldines&#x27;, which concerns the FitzGerald dynasty:

==Modern use==
The phrase remains in common use, both colloquially and in the media, in reference to recent immigration and assimilation in Ireland, and to some degree about some of the Irish diaspora (for example in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Senator Jim Walsh, Liam Twomey, or &quot;Irish Emigrant&quot;) or in conversation discussing the relationship between the cultural heritage of the Irish diaspora and the Irish in Ireland. While still echoing its original meaning, contemporary usage of the phrase usually takes a more open interpretation of assimilation or, in the case of the diaspora, the maintenance of Irish heritage.

Debates of the Oireachtas demonstrate the age and range of contemporary applications of the phrase. Either when discussing the diaspora:
Or, more light-heartedly, on assimilation:
However, S. J. Connolly has written, &quot;The descendants of the English conquerors, it was confidently proclaimed, had become &#x27;more Irish than the Irish themselves&#x27;. Today it is recognized that the supposedly contemporary phrase dates only from the late eighteenth century, the Latin form (&quot;Hiberniores ipsis Hibernis&quot;) sometimes used to give it an authentic medieval ring from later still.&quot;

<text>Daniel Roland Lanois ( , ; born September 19, 1951) is a Canadian record producer and musician.

He has produced albums by artists including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, Robbie Robertson, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, and Harold Budd. He collaborated with Brian Eno to create the ambient genre and produce several albums for U2, including &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987) and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; (1991). Three albums produced or co-produced by Lanois have won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Four other albums received Grammy nominations.

Lanois has released several solo albums. He wrote and performed the music for the 1996 film &quot;Sling Blade,&quot; and provided several vocal tracks for &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Lanois was born in 1951 in Hull, Quebec, to Jill and Guy Lanois. Lanois started his production career when he was 17, recording local artists including Simply Saucer with his brother Bob Lanois in a studio in the basement of their mother&#x27;s home in Ancaster, Ontario. Later, Lanois started Grant Avenue Studio in an old house which he purchased in Hamilton, Ontario. He worked with a number of local bands, including Martha and the Muffins (for which his sister Jocelyne played bass), Ray Materick, Spoons, and the Canadian children&#x27;s singer Raffi. Lanois attended Ancaster High School.

=== Producer ===
In 1981, Lanois played on and produced the album &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot; by Martha and the Muffins. In 1985, he and two members of the band earned a CASBY award for their work on the band&#x27;s (by then going by &quot;M + M&quot;) 1984 album &quot;Mystery Walk&quot;.

Lanois worked collaboratively with Brian Eno on some of Eno&#x27;s own projects, one of which was the &quot;Prophecy Theme&quot; for David Lynch&#x27;s film adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;. Eno invited him to co-produce U2&#x27;s album &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, the 1987 Grammy Award for Album of the Year winner, and some of the band&#x27;s other works including &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, both of which were nominated for the same award but did not win. Lanois once again collaborated with U2 and Brian Eno on the band&#x27;s 2009 album, &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot;. He was involved in the songwriting process as well as mixing and production.

Lanois&#x27; early work with U2 led to him being hired to produce albums for other top-selling artists. He collaborated with Peter Gabriel on his album &quot;Birdy&quot; (1985), the soundtrack to Alan Parker&#x27;s film of the same name, and then spent most of 1985 co-producing Gabriel&#x27;s album &quot;So&quot;. The album was released in 1986 and became his best-selling release, earning multi-platinum sales and a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Lanois later co-produced Gabriel&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Us&quot; which was released in 1992 and also went platinum.

Bono recommended Lanois to Bob Dylan in the late 1980s; in 1989, Lanois produced Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;. Eight years later, Dylan and Lanois worked together on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, which won another Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997. The iconic Neve 8068, featured on the cover of Time Out of Mind, has a home at the historic The Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Purchased by Teresa Knox, it was carefully restored to factory settings. In his autobiographical &quot;Chronicles, Vol. 1&quot;, Dylan describes in depth the contentious but rewarding working relationship he developed with Lanois.

&quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, his 1995 collaboration with Emmylou Harris, won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 1998, he produced and appeared on Willie Nelson&#x27;s album &quot;Teatro.&quot;

Lanois was working on Neil Young&#x27;s record &quot;Le Noise&quot; in June 2010 when he was hospitalized after suffering multiple injuries in a motorcycle crash in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles. He has since recovered.

Lanois&#x27; production is recognizable and notable for its &#x27;big&#x27; and &#x27;live&#x27; drum sound, atmospheric guitars and ambient reverb. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Lanois the &quot;most important record producer to emerge in the Eighties.&quot;

=== Recording artist ===

As well as being a producer, Lanois is a songwriter, musician and recording artist. He has released several solo albums and film scores; his first album, &quot;Acadie&quot; was released in 1989. A number of Lanois&#x27; songs have been covered by other artists, including Dave Matthews, Jerry Garcia Band, Willie Nelson, Tea Party, Anna Beljin, Isabelle Boulay, and Emmylou Harris. His albums have had some success, particularly in Canada. Lanois plays the guitar, pedal steel, and drums. &quot;Belladonna&quot;, an instrumental album released in 2005 was nominated for a Grammy.

Lanois&#x27; song &quot;Sonho Dourado&quot; was included in the 2004 Billy Bob Thornton film, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. In 2005 with the re-release of his first solo album, &quot;Acadie&quot;, a late-1980s version of the song appears on the additional tracks called &quot;Early Dourado Sketch&quot;. Lanois had performed the song numerous times in the intervening years, including on a Toronto television program in 1993 where it was credited as &quot;Irish Melody&quot; on a recording of the performance. Though the melody does indeed feel Irish, the title is Portuguese and means &quot;golden dream&quot;.
Lanois also provided an instrumental score for &quot;LOUDquietLOUD&quot;, a 2006 documentary about the Pixies.

Lanois premiered a documentary entitled &quot;Here Is What Is&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2007. The film chronicles the recording of his album of the same name and includes footage of the actual recording. The album &quot;Here Is What Is&quot; was released, first by download, then on compact disc, in late 2007 and early 2008. Soon after that, Lanois released a three-disc recording called &quot;Omni&quot;.

In October 2009, Lanois started a project called Black Dub which features Lanois on guitar, Brian Blade on drums, and Daryl Johnson on bass, along with multi-instrumentalist/singer Trixie Whitley. They released a self-titled album in 2010. In 2014, Lanois played with Emmylou Harris as a sideman and opening act on a tour focused on the &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; material he produced.

===Solo career===
On October 28, 2014, Lanois released an album titled &quot;Flesh and Machine&quot; on ANTI- Records, based on Brian Eno&#x27;s ambient albums. The instrumental album consists primarily of original atmospheric and process-based sounds, blending pedal steel guitar and a variety of digital and analog sound processing devices. He was assisted by the drummer Brian Blade. In 2016, he released the album &quot;Goodbye to Language&quot; with Rocco Deluca.

The collaborative album &quot;Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois&quot; was released on Venetian Snares&#x27; label Timesig in May 2018.

Lanois also contributed to the composition and production of the soundtrack for the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, released by Rockstar Games. He was given seven composition credits, including one for the song &quot;Table Top&quot;.

==Awards==
Lanois was invested in the Order of Canada in 2018. Lanois has received seven Grammy Awards for his work with various artists, including Bob Dylan, U2, Emmylou Harris and Neil Young, and several Juno Awards and nominations. 
 In 2005, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In June 2013, he received a lifetime achievement award at the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards.

<doc id="244233" wikidata="Q221401" url="?curid=244233" title="Vezina Trophy">
<text>The Vezina Trophy ( ) is awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender who is &quot;adjudged to be the best at this position&quot;. At the end of each season, the thirty-two NHL general managers vote to determine the winner. It is named in honour of Georges Vezina, goaltender of the Montreal Canadiens from 1910 until 1925, who died in 1926 of tuberculosis. The trophy was first awarded after the 1926–27 NHL season and was awarded to the top goaltender. From to , the trophy went to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season; since the 1981–82 season, the William M. Jennings Trophy has been awarded for this accomplishment.

The most recent winner is Connor Hellebuyck in the 2023–24 season.

==History==
The Vezina Trophy was named in honor of Georges Vezina, an exceptional goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens. Vezina collapsed during a game in 1925 and was diagnosed as having tuberculosis, of which he died in 1926. Upon Vezina&#x27;s death, the trophy was donated to the League by the Canadiens&#x27; owners, Leo Dandurand, Louis Letourneau and Joe Cattarinich to honour Vezina permanently. It was first awarded at the end of the 1926–27 NHL season to George Hainsworth who had come to Montreal to succeed Vezina.

The trophy was accepted by the league at its May 15, 1927, meeting in Montreal. The criteria for winning was variously reported. The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that it was &#x27;to be awarded each year to the goaltender in the National Hockey League having the best (goals against) average,&#x27; while the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that the trophy went to the &#x27;most valuable&#x27; goaltender in the league. When Hainsworth won his third Vezina at the end of the 1928–29 NHL season, the trophy was reported to be for the &#x27;most outstanding&#x27; goaltender in the league. However, later reports state that the trophy was based on the lowest goals against average (GAA).

The Vezina Trophy was quite prestigious, as it was one of the three major personal awards given out by the National Hockey League at the time, along with the Hart Trophy and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. The hockey media closely follow a tight &quot;Vezina Trophy race,&quot; such as in , when Frank Brimsek, Turk Broda, and Johnny Mowers were separated by only three goals entering the final weekend of the season.

===1946 to 1981===
In February 1946, the NHL stated that the trophy was to go to the team that allowed the fewest goals during the regular season. The goaltender playing the most games for that team would be awarded the trophy. Manager Tommy Gorman of the Montreal Canadiens stated that if the trophy was awarded to his team, management would decide which of the Habs&#x27; two goaltenders (Paul Bibeault and Bill Durnan) would receive the trophy. However, at a banquet that October, NHL President Clarence Campbell indicated that while the league was considering changing the voting methods of the Calder, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies, the criteria for the Vezina were not changing.

Since it was common for goaltenders to start every game before 1950, the Vezina usually went to the goaltender with the lowest personal goals against average in the league; however, there were two notable exceptions. George Hainsworth was awarded the inaugural trophy, while Clint Benedict had the lowest GAA in . Hainsworth&#x27;s Canadiens allowed fewer goals as a team than Benedict&#x27;s Maroons. Wilf Cude had the lowest GAA in in 30 games split between the Detroit Red Wings and Canadiens, but the Vezina was awarded to Charlie Gardiner, who started all 48 games for the Chicago Black Hawks, the team that allowed the fewest goals.

The National Hockey League lengthened the schedule to 70 games starting in . Before then, it was very common for a goaltender to play every minute of his team&#x27;s season, and only two Vezina winners—Frank Brimsek in both (43 of 48 games) and (47 of 48 games) and Bill Durnan in (40 of 50 games)—failed to start every game for their respective clubs.

As teams started to use more than one goaltender in a season regularly, it became increasingly common for the goaltender with the lowest GAA not to be a member of the team that allowed the fewest goals. The Vezina continued to be awarded to the goaltender who started the most games for the team that allowed the fewest goals, but the Vezina winners of , , and did not have the lowest GAAs.

The National Hockey League began allowing teammates to split the Vezina Trophy following the 1964–65 NHL season. The Toronto Maple Leafs allowed 173 goals against (0 empty net goals), barely beating out Detroit&#x27;s 175 goals against (3 empty net goals), and Chicago&#x27;s 176 goals against (3 empty net goals). Toronto Terry Sawchuk played 36 games for the Leafs with a GAA of 2.56, while his teammate Johnny Bower played 34 games with a league-leading GAA of 2.38, but Sawchuk was to be the sole winner under the old criteria. During the season, the two agreed to split the $1000 prize money that came with the trophy if either of them won. At the end of the season, Sawchuk publicly stated that he would refuse the trophy if Bower would not also have his name inscribed. The NHL subsequently changed the rule to allow any goaltender on the team who allowed the fewest goals against to qualify for the Vezina if he played at least 25 games, and applied this rule retroactively to Sawchuk and Bower. Under this criterion, Turk Broda would have shared the Vezina that Al Rollins won in . This criterion was in place until .

The Vezina criteria had the trophy going to the goaltender(s) of the team that was best at preventing goals, not necessarily the best individual goaltender of the year. The best goaltender, as voted by the media, was the NHL first team All-Star. These often differed, such as in when Don Edwards and Bob Sauve shared the Vezina while Tony Esposito was named to the First Team. During the 1973–74 NHL season, the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers finished tied for the fewest goals against; therefore their respective goaltenders, Tony Esposito and Bernie Parent, were both awarded the trophy, the only time that it would be shared between two players from different teams. For 1973–74 the media voted Parent a First Team All-Star and Esposito a Second Team All-Star. Glenn Hall, who played for Detroit, Chicago and St. Louis during his career, was voted the First Team All-Star goaltender the most times of any goaltender, seven times, but only won the Vezina Trophy as the goaltender on the team allowing the fewest goals against three times. By contrast, Jacques Plante, was awarded the Vezina Trophy seven times, six of those when with the very dominant Montreal Canadiens of the 1950s and 1960s, but was voted as the First Team All-Star only three times. Plante&#x27;s seventh Vezina Trophy was shared with Hall as they shared goaltending duties for the St. Louis Blues in 1968–69 when that team allowed the fewest goals in the league; Hall was voted as the First Team All-Star that year.

===1981 to the present===
As of the 1981–82 NHL season, the Vezina Trophy has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as voted by the general managers of the NHL teams. Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system. The William M. Jennings Trophy, given to the goaltender(s) who play(s) a minimum of 25 games for the team that allows the fewest goals, serves the function of the old Vezina.

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by the 32 general managers of the teams in the National Hockey League, with all individual voters ranking their top three candidates on a 5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.

===Records and distinctions===
Jacques Plante holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven, followed by Bill Durnan and Dominik Hasek, who have won six each. Hasek has won the most awards under the current criterion of voting for the best individual goalie. Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 29 times.

Only four players have won both the Vezina and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season: Jacques Plante for ; Dominik Hasek twice, for and ; Jose Theodore for ; and Carey Price for . Two other goaltenders have won the Vezina and Hart trophies in separate seasons: Roy Worters (Hart , Vezina ) and Al Rollins (Vezina , Hart ). Chuck Rayner is the only goaltender who has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (which he did in ) but never won the Vezina Trophy.

==Winners==

===1927–81===




When introduced, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the top goaltender in the league. Several winners, including Hainsworth in 1927 and Gardiner in 1934, did not have the lowest goals-against average. In 1946, the NHL Governors further clarified the criteria for winning. It was to go to the team with the fewest goals scored against it during the season. The goalie playing the most games for the team was awarded the trophy. In 1965, the NHL Governors began allowing teammates to share the Vezina Trophy. From 1965 to 1981, the Vezina was awarded to any goaltenders who played 25 or more games for the team allowing the fewest goals against.

===1981–present===
The NHL adopted the current criteria for the Vezina Trophy beginning in 1981–82. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a new award for the goaltender(s) playing 25 or more games for the team allowing the fewest goals against.

<doc id="244239" wikidata="Q3355809" url="?curid=244239" title="Oregon Country Fair">
<text>The Oregon Country Fair (OCF) is a nonprofit organization and an annual three-day art and music fair held outside the city limits of Veneta, Oregon, United States. Located in the Willamette Valley, the site is about west of Eugene along the Long Tom River near the unincorporated community of Elmira. Annual attendance is approximately 35,000, and the fair has around 960 craft and food booths each year. The event is known as an outgrowth of the counter-culture movement and for using environmentally-friendly practices during the fair.

The Oregon Country Fair begins on the Friday of the second weekend in July every year (i.e. as early as July 7 and as late as July 13). The fair is a non-profit organization and as such has a board of directors. Additionally, the management structure of the Oregon Country Fair is typically composed of an Executive Director, an Operations Manager, a Site and Facilities Manager, and a team of volunteer Back Up Managers, otherwise known as BUMS, who serve as representation for the fair&#x27;s paid management staff for the duration of the event.


==History==
The first fair, organized by Ron and Robin Ulrich, was held in Eugene over the weekend of November 1–2, 1969, on Eugene&#x27;s Hawkins Heights. It was promoted with the tagline, &quot;come in costume&quot;.
The fair began as a craft fair to raise funds for an alternative school, the Children&#x27;s Community School.
The event moved to its current location in Veneta, about 13 miles west of Eugene, for the fall fair in October, 1970, after having had a May Fair the same year on Crow Road about halfway between Eugene and Veneta.

In August 1972 and August 1982, OCF hosted concerts headlined by the Grateful Dead. Known as &quot;Field Trips&quot;, the first concert was held as a benefit for the Springfield Creamery, which is owned by members of Ken Kesey&#x27;s family.

Until 1977, the fair was known as the &quot;Oregon Renaissance Faire&quot;.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual fair in the cloud(s) was held in 2020, and 2021. The in-person fair resumed in 2022.

==Entertainment==

During open hours (11 am to 7 pm) there are 22 stages featuring a wide variety of musical, comedic, theatrical, juggling, daredevil, and vaudeville performances.

The stages are: Main Stage, DuCaniveaux Stage, Kesey Stage, Caravan Stage, W.C. Fields Stage, Dance Pavilion, Flow Zone, WorkItShop, Spirit Tower, Rabbit Hole, Front Porch, Blue Moon Stage, Stage Left, Chez Ray&#x27;s Next Stage, Monkey Palace, Might Tiny Puppet Stage, Hoarse Chorale, Morningwood Odditorium, Community Village, and Youth Stage. The Ritz, which has showering facilities and two saunas, also includes a stage.

Musical acts incorporate many styles, including: folk, rock, jazz, blues, bluegrass, Latin, reggae, slam poetry and spoken word. There are also numerous musicians engaged in busking along the pathways as well as parades and walking performers throughout the entire fair site, including a marching band, giant puppets, and stilt walkers.

There is also a drum circle at the Drum Tower which is open to all willing participants who bring their musical instruments.

==Tickets and transportation==
Tickets and passes are required to attend the Oregon Country Fair. All tickets are sold in advance at TicketsWest outlets and other retail centers throughout the Northwest. All tickets must be purchased off-site; no tickets are sold at the fair site. Discount tickets are available for people who qualify for disability or senior discounts. There is no fee for children who are under the age of twelve and come with a paying adult. Public transportation, in the form of bus shuttle, provides a park and ride service between Eugene and the OCF grounds non-stop throughout the days of the fair.

==Culture==
The fair is a family event with face painting, puppet shows, and music for children. Toplessness is permitted while full nudity is not allowed during public hours in public areas. No alcohol is allowed, and smoking is limited to designated areas. All glass bottles are banned from the fairgrounds in an attempt to protect the safety of shoeless fairgoers, and to preserve the integrity of the land. The fair has its own water and communications systems, recycling service, emergency medical team, traffic control, and security team. Since 1997 there has been a strong effort to make it a drug-free event.

==Infrastructure==
The fair is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It is governed by an elected twelve-member board of directors. There are eleven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions include an Executive Director, two Event Managers, a Marketing Manager, a Site and Facilities Manager, an Office Manager, Residential Caretaker, two Groundskeepers, and an Administrative Assistant. 

Alter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the &quot;Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center&quot; (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), &quot;Community Village&quot;, &quot;Solutions&quot;, and all &quot;Information booths&quot;.

From June 1 through August 31 there are no dogs (except service dogs) allowed on the event site.

Publications

The Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year, as well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three-day event.

==Volunteer crews==
The Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. Volunteer crews are separated into &quot;Pre-fair Crews&quot; and &quot;During Fair Crews.&quot; Pre-fair crews work from the site&#x27;s opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public on the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site&#x27;s physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager.

All volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of The Oregon Country Fair is:

==History of the land==
The Willamette Valley has been continuously occupied by humans, to some extent, for at least the last 9,000–10,000 years (this timeline is based on the archaeological evidence gathered from 34 archaeological sites in the Upper Willamette Valley).
The Oregon Country Fair property includes archaeological sites protected by state law. It is thought to have previously been a gathering place for the Kalapuya tribe of Native Americans. All ground disturbing activities on the fair property must be approved by the archaeology and construction crews.

The Kalapuya lived in permanent winter homes and migrated throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the summers. Subsistence was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering wild plant foods.

Based on the translation of Kalapuya texts, strong historical aspects of the Kalapuya culture include: the dream, the dream spirit-power, death, wealth, prestige, sexual division of labor (men hunt, women gather), sex, acculturation, and language. The dream spirit-power was observed to be the strongest. The dream power was constantly referred to in matters of courage and bravery, of sickness and resisting disease, gambling, hunting, wealth, casting spells, power over natural phenomena and becoming a shaman.

Much of the fair site is a wetland and the Long Tom River floods much of the fair property each winter.

==Educational areas==
Some of the Oregon Country Fair&#x27;s areas are organized to be information and workshop resources.
The &quot;Kids Loop&quot; is a children&#x27;s play area, &quot;Yes You Canopy&quot; is a pavilion dedicated to the teaching of juggling, &quot;Energy Park&quot; is an area with displays and demonstrations on alternative energy, alternative transportation, organic agriculture and recycling, and &quot;Community Village&quot; has booths from non-profit organizations dedicated to education, information access, plants and gardening, including a display by the Oregon State University/Lane County Extension Master Gardeners, and other forms of progressive social change.

&quot;Archaeology Park&quot; (&quot;Ark Park&quot;) is the home of the fair&#x27;s archaeology crew, and includes replica cedar houses like those used by Pacific Northwest Native American tribes, displays of artifacts and photos of archaeological digs from the fair site, and hands-on demonstrations of flintknapping, firemaking, basket weaving and other Native American skills.

==Philanthropy==
The OCF organization maintains close ties with the Eugene-area community and supports many other nonprofit organizations through its philanthropic programs.

Fairgoers, fair working volunteers, and the OCF organization alike contribute to non-profit groups through &quot;The Jill Heiman Vision Fund&quot;. This fund grants funds to tax-exempt organizations in Lane County. Donations are provided to projects and programs related to improving the environment and fostering sustainability.

The OCF Board has created &quot;The Bill Wooten Endowment Fund&quot; to assist arts, environmental, and social justice projects. The Board of Directors also offers donations to various groups and activities that share its values of living artfully and authentically on the earth.

<doc id="244245" wikidata="Q332806" url="?curid=244245" title="George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville">
<text>Major general George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, PC (26 January 1716 – 26 August 1785) was a British Army officer, politician, and peer who served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1775 to 1782. Serving in the North ministry during the American War of Independence, he received significant blame for Britain&#x27;s defeat in the conflict; Sackville&#x27;s issuance of confusing instructions to British commanders in North America coupled with his failure to understand either the geography of Britain&#x27;s American colonies or the determination of the rebels&#x27; resolve have led historians to support such arguments. Sackville served in the British army in the War of the Austrian Succession and in Seven Years&#x27; War, including at the decisive Battle of Minden, after which he was court-martialled. His political career ended with the fall of the North ministry in March 1782.

==Early life and education==
Sackville was the third son of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-General Walter Philip Colyear. His Godfather George I attended his baptism. He was educated at Westminster School in London and graduated from Trinity College in Dublin in 1737. Between 1730 and 1737 and again from 1750 to 1755, his father held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. While in Dublin he befriended the celebrated writer Jonathan Swift. He also encountered Lord Ligonier who would later assist his career in the military.

He then entered the army. Sackville was elected Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1751 and served for two years.

==Family==
He married Diana Sambrooke, daughter of John Sambrook and Elizabeth Forester, on 3 September 1754. They had two sons and two daughters, including:
*Diana Sackville (8 July 1756 – 29 August 1814), married John Crosbie, 2nd Earl of Glandore
*Charles Sackville (27 August 1767 – 29 July 1843), later changed his name to Charles Sackville-Germain.
*George Sackville (7 December 1770 – 31 May 1836)
*Elizabeth, married Henry Herbert, MP

He was known to be gay.

==Early military career==

Sackville started as a captain in the 7th Horse (later the 6th Dragoon Guards). In 1740, he transferred to the Gloucestershire Regiment of Foot as a lieutenant colonel. The regiment was sent to Germany to participate in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1743. Sackville was advanced to brevet colonel.

===Battle of Fontenoy===

He saw his first battle, leading the charge of the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s infantry in the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. He led his regiment so deep into the French lines that when he was wounded and captured he was taken to the tent of Louis XV. When he was released and returned home, it was to duty in Scotland as the Colonel of the 20th Foot Regiment.

In 1747 and 1748, he again joined the Duke of Cumberland. He became colonel of the 7th Irish horse and served in Holland. There was a break in his military career between wars (1750–1755) when he served as first secretary to his father.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Sackville returned to active military service. He had been considered for the post of Commander-in-Chief in North America, which eventually went to Edward Braddock, who led his force to disaster during the Braddock Campaign. In 1755, he was promoted to major general and returned to active service to oversee ordnance. In 1758, he was given a fourth regiment and joined the Duke of Marlborough as a lieutenant general. He was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1758.

===Raid on St Malo===

In June 1758 Sackville was second in command of a British expedition, led by Marlborough, which attempted an amphibious Raid on St Malo. While it failed to take the town as instructed, the raid was still considered to have been largely successful as a diversion. Follow-up raids were considered against Le Havre, Caen and other targets in Normandy, but no further landings were attempted, and the force returned home.

Later in 1758 they joined the allied forces of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany, with the first detachment of British troops sent to the Continent. When Marlborough died, Sackville became Commander of the British contingent of the army, although still under the overall command of the Duke of Brunswick.

==Battle of Minden==

In the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, British and Hanoverian infantry of the centre made an advance on the French cavalry and artillery in that sector. They apparently went in without orders and their attacking line formation even repulsed repeated French cavalry charges, holding until the last moment then firing a massive volley when the charge came within ten yards. As the disrupted French began to fall back on Minden, Ferdinand called for a British cavalry charge to complete the victory, but Sackville withheld permission for their advance. Ferdinand sent his order several times, but Sackville was estranged from Lord Granby, the force commander. He continued to withhold permission for Granby to &quot;gain glory&quot; through an attack. For that action, he was cashiered and sent home. Granby replaced him as commander of the British contingent for the remainder of the war.

===Court martial===
Sackville refused to accept responsibility for refusing to obey orders. Back in England, he demanded a court martial, and made it a large enough issue that he obtained his demand in 1760. The court found him guilty, and imposed one of the strangest and strongest verdicts ever rendered against a general officer. The court&#x27;s verdict not only upheld his discharge but also ruled that he was &quot;unfit to serve His Majesty in any military Capacity whatever&quot;, then ordered that their verdict be read to and entered in the orderly book of every regiment in the army. The King had his name struck from the Privy Council rolls.

==Early political career==
=== Member of Parliament ===
Sackville had been a Member of Parliament at intervals since 1733. He had served terms in both the Dublin and the Westminster bodies, sometimes simultaneously, but had not taken sides in political wrangles. Between 1750 and 1755 he served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, during his father&#x27;s second term as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

When George III ascended to the British throne in 1760, Sackville began his political rehabilitation. There did not seem to be negative repercussions to the European stalemate of the Seven Years&#x27; War. The victories over the French within the colonial empire provided a chance for events of the war to be forgotten. The difficulty of repaying the debts incurred to fight the war caused a period of unstable ministries and shifting political alliances. In 1765, King George quietly returned him to the rolls of the Privy Council.

Initially he was a follower of George Grenville&#x27;s faction, but he increasingly lined up as a supporter of Lord North and, in 1769, he made the alliance formal. Then, in 1769, Lady Elizabeth Germain died without natural heirs, and left her estates, including Drayton, Northamptonshire, to him. That not only improved his finances but also gave him the chance to take that name formally. After 1770, he was known as Lord George Germain.

==Secretary of State==
===Appointment===
On 10 November 1775, Germain was appointed Secretary of State for the American Department replacing Lord Dartmouth in the post. At that time, North&#x27;s cabinet had three secretaries of state; one each for Europe (the Northern Department), America, and the rest of the world (the Southern Department). Besides international relations, the secretaries were responsible for a great deal of Colonial administration and for military operations within their area. That made Germain the primary minister responsible for suppressing the rebellion that had broken out in 1775 in the colonies. He promoted or relieved generals, took care of provisions and supplies and became involved with the strategic planning of the war.

===American War of Independence===
In 1776, he worked with General John Burgoyne to plan, support and issue orders for the Saratoga campaign. However, his unclear orders to General William Howe contributed to the campaign&#x27;s failure. Following the entry of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic into the conflict, British emphasis shifted to focus increasingly on their colonial territories in the Caribbean and India. British troops were withdrawn from Philadelphia and reinforcements were sent to the British West Indies. In 1779 one of Germain&#x27;s associates, Richard Cumberland, was sent to Madrid for failed talks designed to reach a separate peace settlement with Spain.

====Yorktown====

In 1781, the confusion involving orders sent to Charles Cornwallis from Henry Clinton contributed to the loss at the Siege of Yorktown.

The news of Yorktown reached London on 25 November 1781, and the messenger went first to Germain&#x27;s residence at Pall Mall. Germain then went to tell other ministers. Together they went to Lord North, who reportedly cried out &quot;Oh God – It&#x27;s all over&quot;. It was agreed that Germain, rather than North, should take the news to the King who was at Kew. The King&#x27;s Speech two days later had to be re-written in light of Yorktown. News of the surrender galvanised the opposition, and the government majorities began to shrink over the following months with calls for resignations of senior ministers. Germain drew up a plan to continue the war by using the existing British bases in Charleston, New York, Savannah, and Canada to harass the American coastline and frontiers. He also advocated re-occupying Newport in Rhode Island to give a foothold in New England.

===Departure from office===
Germain became a target for the opposition and was eventually persuaded to step down in exchange for a peerage, and in February 1782, he was made Baron Bolebrooke, in the County of Sussex, and Viscount Sackville, of Drayton in the County of Northampton. That was considered essential if the North government was to survive by bringing in factions of the opposition to which Germain was personally objectionable. He was replaced by Welbore Ellis. In spite of Germain&#x27;s departure, the North government fell shortly afterwards in February 1782 and was followed by a period of political instability. Shortly after the fall of the North government, news arrived of the decisive British naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes in the Caribbean, which would have boosted the government if it had still been in power and British successes late in the war came partly thanks to the strategic dispositions made by North and Germain. The Shelburne government agreed to the Peace of Paris, which brought an end to the war in 1783 and recognised the independence of the United States.

==Later life==

The controversy over Lord Sackville&#x27;s handling of the war continued. Some members were opposed to his taking a seat in the House of Lords, an almost unprecedented incident. However, he was admitted to the Lords, where he was staunchly defended by Lord Thurlow, and his declining health soon made the issue irrelevant. He retired to his country home at Stoneland Lodge and died there in 1785. He maintained to his dying day that he had not been a coward at Minden. Following his death, a defence of Sackville&#x27;s reputation, &quot;The character of the late Viscount Sackville&quot;, was written by Richard Cumberland. A trove of the subject&#x27;s letters were published by the Historical Records Commission beginning in 1904 under the title &quot;Report on the manuscripts of Mrs. Stopford-Sackville, of Drayton House, Northhamptonshire / with a new introduction and preface by George Athan Billias&quot;.

The Drayton House estate passed to his son Charles, who later became the 5th (and last) Duke of Dorset. The Stoneland estate (or Buckhurst Park as it came to be known) passed via the wife of the late 3rd Duke of Dorset to her daughter Countess de la Warr on the Dowager Duchess&#x27;s death in 1825.

It became part of the Province of New Brunswick in 1784. The Town was incorporated in 1903.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Count Jourdan (; 29 April 1762 – 23 November 1833), was a French military commander who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was made a Marshal of the Empire by Emperor Napoleon I in 1804. He was also a Jacobin politician during the Directory phase of the French Revolution, serving as member of the Council of Five Hundred between 1797 and 1799.

One of the most successful commanders of the French Revolutionary Army, Jourdan is best remembered in the Revolution for leading the French to a decisive victory over the First Coalition at the Battle of Fleurus, during the Flanders campaign. Under the Empire he was rewarded by Napoleon with the title of Marshal and continued to hold military assignments, but suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Vitoria, which resulted in the Empire&#x27;s permanent loss of Spain. In 1815 he became reconciled with the Bourbon Restoration, and later supported the July Revolution and served in his last years as governor of the Hôtel des Invalides.

==Early life==

Jourdan was born in Limoges, in the province of Limousin, on 29 April 1762. He was the only surviving child of Roch Jourdan, a surgeon originally from Meyrargues, and Jeanne Foreau-Franciquet. His mother died at childbirth when he was two years old, and after being raised by his father for a few years, Jourdan was put under the care of an uncle, the &quot;Abbé&quot; Laurent Jourdan, a parish priest who ran a boarding school in Beaurecueil, in Provence. His father died when he was nine years old, at around 1771, leaving Jourdan as an impoverished orphan.

After finishing his basic education at the school in Beaurecueil, at fifteen years old Jourdan was sent to the care of another uncle, Jean-François Jourdan, a cloth merchant in Lyon and disciplinarian employer. Working as an apprentice clerk at the clothing shop, Jourdan endured for about a year in Lyon before enlisting in the Royal army in 1778, joining the regiment of &quot;Auxerrois&quot; stationed in the Île de Ré, which was destined for service in the American War of Independence.

==American Revolutionary War==

Jourdan spent the rest of the year with the regiment in Île de Ré before it departed for the war in America. He first saw action at the capture of Granada in mid-1779. A few months later the Auxerrois regiment was put under the command of the Comte d&#x27;Estaing, and in this assignment Jourdan soon participated in the ill-fated assault at the Siege of Savannah, in October 1779. Through the next years he served in the West Indies. He took part in the successful defense of the recently captured island of Saint Vincent, in 1780, and in the invasion of Tobago in 1781.

During his duty in the West Indies, Jourdan fell ill with what was officially diagnosed as hernia, though it was likely an intestinal disease, and bouts of illness troubled him for the rest of his military career. Due to this period of poor health he missed most of the campaigns of 1782, only returning to the army at the end of the year.

===Return to Limoges===

In June 1784, Jourdan was demobilized from the Royal army in Verdun, and, after a period of unemployment, returned to his native Limoges and found work at a cloth merchant&#x27;s shop, where he proved to be an excellent employee. He married Jeanne Nicolas Avanturier, the sister of his boss, in Limoges on 22 January 1788, and the couple had six children.

==War of the First Coalition==
Jourdan welcomed the French Revolution with enthusiasm. He was appointed lieutenant of the &quot;chasseurs&quot; of the National Guard in 1790, and when the National Assembly asked for volunteers, Jourdan was elected commander of the 9th battalion of volunteers from Haute-Vienne. He led his troops in the French victory at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792 and in the defeat at the Battle of Neerwinden on 18 March 1793. Jourdan&#x27;s leadership skills were noticed and led to his promotion to Brigade general on 27 May 1793 and to general of division two months later. On 8 September, he led his division at the Battle of Hondschoote, in which he was wounded in the chest. On 22 September, he was named to lead the Army of the North. Three of his predecessors, Nicolas Luckner, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, and Jean Nicolas Houchard were under arrest and later executed by guillotine.

Jourdan&#x27;s first assignment was to relieve General Jacques Ferrand&#x27;s 20,000-man garrison of Maubeuge which was besieged by an Austrian-Dutch army commanded by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The Committee of Public Safety felt that this mission was so important that it dispatched Lazare Carnot to oversee the operation. Jourdan defeated Coburg on 15–16 October at the Battle of Wattignies and broke the siege. Carnot claimed that it was his own intervention that won the victory. Historian Michael Glover writes that the first day&#x27;s attack was a failure because of Carnot&#x27;s interference, while the second day&#x27;s success resulted from Jourdan using his own tactical judgment. In any case, only Carnot&#x27;s account reached Paris.

On 10 January 1794, after refusing to carry out an impossible order, Jourdan was brought before the Committee of Public Safety. Carnot presented Jourdan&#x27;s arrest warrant, which was signed by Maximilien de Robespierre, Bertrand Barère, and Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois. Jourdan was saved from certain execution when an eyewitness, representative on mission Ernest Joseph Duquesnoy rose and contradicted Carnot&#x27;s version of events at Wattignies. Spared from arrest, Jourdan was nevertheless dismissed from the army and sent home.

The government soon recalled Jourdan to lead the Army of the Moselle. In May, he was ordered north with the left wing of the Army of the Moselle. This force was combined with the Army of the Ardennes and the right wing of the Army of the North to form an army which did not officially become the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse until 29 June 1794. With 70,000 soldiers of the new army, Jourdan laid siege to Charleroi on 12 June. A 41,000-man Austrian-Dutch army under the Prince of Orange defeated the French at the Battle of Lambusart on 16 June and drove them south of the Sambre River. Casualties numbered 3,000 for each army. Undeterred, Jourdan immediately marched on Namur to the east-northeast of Charleroi. Instead of attacking Namur, he suddenly swung west and appeared to the north of Charleroi. After a brief siege, the 3,000-man Austrian garrison of Charleroi surrendered on 25 June. Military strategist B. H. Liddell Hart cited Jourdan&#x27;s maneuver as an example of the indirect approach, even though it was probably inadvertent on the French general&#x27;s part. Too late to save Charlerloi, Coburg&#x27;s 46,000-strong army attacked Jourdan&#x27;s 75,000 French on 26 June. The Battle of Fleurus proved to be a strategic French victory when Coburg called off his attacks and retreated. During the battle, the Allied attacks pushed back both French flanks, but Jourdan stubbornly fought it out and was saved when General François Joseph Lefebvre&#x27;s division held its ground in the center.
After Fleurus, the Allied position in the Austrian Netherlands collapsed. The Austrian Army evacuated Belgium and the Dutch Republic was dissolved by the advancing French armies in 1795. On 7 June 1795, Jourdan&#x27;s army concluded the long but successful Siege of Luxembourg. Operations east of the Rhine were less successful that year, with the French capturing, then losing Mannheim.

In the Rhine campaign of 1796, Jourdan&#x27;s Army of Sambre-et-Meuse formed the left wing of the advance into Bavaria. The whole of the French forces were ordered to advance on Vienna, Jourdan on the extreme left, General Jean Victor Marie Moreau in the centre by the Danube valley, and Napoleon on the right in Italy. The campaign began brilliantly, with the Austrians under Archduke Charles being driven back by Moreau and Jourdan almost to the Austrian frontier. But Charles, slipping away from Moreau, threw his whole weight on Jourdan, who was defeated at the Battle of Amberg in August. Jourdan failed to salvage the situation at the Battle of Würzburg and was forced over the Rhine after the Battle of Limburg, which cost the life of General François Séverin Marceau. Moreau had to fall back in turn, and the operations of the year in Germany were a failure. The chief cause of defeat was the plan of campaign imposed upon the generals by their government. Jourdan was nevertheless made the scapegoat and was not employed for two years. In those years he became prominent as a politician and above all as the framer of the famous conscription law of 1798, which came to be known as the Jourdan Law.

==War of the Second Coalition==

When war was renewed in 1799, Jourdan was at the head of the army on the Rhine, but again suffered defeat at the hands of Archduke Charles at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in late March. Disappointed and broken in health, he handed over command to General André Masséna. He resumed his political duties and was a prominent opponent of the Coup of 18 Brumaire, after which he was expelled from the Council of Five Hundred. Soon, however, he became formally reconciled to the new &quot;régime&quot;, and accepted from Napoleon fresh military and civil employment. In 1800, Jourdan became inspector-general of cavalry and infantry and representative of French interests in the Cisalpine Republic.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In 1804, Napoleon appointed Jourdan as a Marshal of the Empire. He remained in the newly created Kingdom of Italy until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte, whom his brother made King of Naples that year, selected Jourdan as his military adviser. He followed Joseph into Spain in 1808; but Joseph&#x27;s throne had to be maintained by the French Army, and throughout the Peninsular War, the other marshals, who depended directly upon Napoleon, paid little heed either to Joseph or to Jourdan. Jourdan was blamed for the defeat at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 and replaced by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. He was reinstated as Joseph&#x27;s chief of staff in September 1811 but given few troops. After the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Joseph and Jourdan were forced to abandon Madrid and retreat to Valencia. Joining with Soult&#x27;s army, which evacuated Andalusia, the French were able to recapture Madrid during the Siege of Burgos and push Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-Portuguese army back to Portugal.

The following year, Wellington advanced again with a large, well-organized army. Repeatedly outmaneuvering the French, the Anglo-Allied army forced Joseph and Jourdan to fight at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, during which his marshal&#x27;s baton was captured by the British. After the French decisive defeat, which resulted in the permanent loss of Spain, Jourdan held no important commands up to the fall of the French Empire. He adhered to the first Bourbon Restoration, in 1814, but joined Napoleon on his return to power during the Hundred Days and was appointed commander of Besançon.

==Later life==
Jourdan submitted to the Bourbons again after the final French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Afterwards he refused to be a member of the court which sentenced Marshal Michel Ney to death. He was made a count (&quot;comte de l’Empire&quot;) in 1804, a Peer of France in 1819, and governor of Grenoble in 1816. In politics, Jourdan was a prominent opponent of the royalist reactionaries and supported the Revolution of 1830. After this event, he held the portfolio of foreign affairs for a few days and then became governor of the Hôtel des Invalides, a post he held until his death. Jourdan died in Paris on 23 November 1833 and was buried in Les Invalides.

While in exile on Saint Helena, Napoleon admitted, I certainly used that man very ill ... I have learned with pleasure that since my fall he invariably acted in the best manner. He has thus afforded an example of that praiseworthy elevation of mind which distinguishes men one from another. Jourdan is a true patriot; and that is the answer to many things that have been said of him.

Jourdan wrote &quot;Opérations de l&#x27;armée du Danube&quot; (&quot;Operations of the Army of the Danube&quot;, 1799), &quot;Mémoires pour servir a l&#x27;histoire sur la campagne de 1796&quot; (&quot;Memoirs to serve history of the campaign of 1796&quot;, 1819), and unpublished personal memoirs.

<text>Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne (; 23 April 1756 – 3 June 1819), also known as Jean Nicolas or by his nicknames, the Righteous Patriot or the Tiger, was a French lawyer and a major figure in the French Revolution. A close associate of Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre, he was one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety, and is often considered a key architect of the Reign of Terror.

Billaud-Varenne subsequently broke with Robespierre, partly due to their ideological conflicts relating to the centralization of power. Ultimately he played a major role in Robespierre&#x27;s downfall on 9 Thermidor, an act for which he later expressed remorse. After Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne was part of the &quot;Crêtois&quot;, the last group of deputies from The Mountain. He presided over the persecution of Louis-Marie Turreau and Jean-Baptiste Carrier for their massacres during the War in the Vendée, which ended by their execution.

Billaud-Varenne was later arrested during the Thermidorian Reaction. Deported to Cayenne without trial, he married a black ex-slave named Brigitte, refused Napoleon&#x27;s pardon there and finally died in Port-au-Prince in 1819.

Billaud-Varenne was one of the central figures of the first part of the French Revolution, but he remains little studied or little understood.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Billaud-Varenne was born in La Rochelle as the son of a lawyer to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris. Since both his grandfather and father were lawyers, and he was the first son in his direct family, Varenne was guaranteed a solid education and the same profession. Billaud-Varenne was educated at the college at Niort run by the French Oratorians, and took Philosophy at La Rochelle. His education at Niort was particularly important in shaping his character because its methods of teaching were uncommon to the revolution. At Niort, modernity and tolerance were emphasized, as opposed to most other schools of the time. Billaud-Varenne was also sent to another Oratory of Jesus school, the College of Juilly, where he was Hall prefect of studies. Here he later became a professor when he felt dissatisfied with practicing law, remaining for a short while, until his writing of a strained his relationship with those who ran the school and he was obliged to leave in 1785.

He then went to Paris, married and bought a position as lawyer in the . In early 1789 he published at Amsterdam a three-volume work on the , and a well-received anti-clerical text titled &quot;The Last Blow Against Prejudice and Superstition.&quot; As events moved closer to Bastille Day, he adopted with enthusiasm the principles of the French Revolution. An example of his beliefs regarding the Church can be found in this text:
===Early activism===

Joining the Jacobin Club, Billaud-Varenne became, from 1790, one of the most violent anti-Royalist orators, closely linked to Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois. After the flight to Varennes of King Louis XVI, he published a pamphlet, (from the , meaning &#x27;power without head), in which he demanded the establishment of a federal republic.

On 1 July, in another speech at the Jacobin Club, he spoke of a republic, arousing the derision of partisans of the constitutional monarchy. But when he repeated his demand for a republic a fortnight later, the speech was printed and sent to the Jacobin branch societies throughout France.

On the night of 10 August 1792 (during the attack on the Tuileries Palace) he met with Danton, Desmoulins, and other members of the Insurrectionary Commune during the critical hours before the overthrow of the monarchy. Later that day, he was elected one of the &quot;deputy-commissioners&quot; of the sections who shortly afterwards became the general council of the Paris Commune. He was accused of having been an accomplice in the September Massacres in the Abbaye prison.

===Projects in the Convention===

Elected, like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Collot d&#x27;Herbois, a deputy of Paris to the National Convention, he spoke in favour of the immediate abolition of the Bourbon monarchy, and the next day demanded that all acts be dated from the &quot;Year I of the French Republic&quot; (a measure adopted a little over a year later in the form of the French Revolutionary Calendar).

At the trial of Louis XVI he added new charges to the accusation, proposed to refuse counsel to the king, and voted for death &quot;within 24 hours&quot;. On 2 June 1793, in the context of Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s anti-Girondist instigations, he proposed a decree of accusation against the Girondists; a week later, at the Jacobin Club, he outlined a programme which the convention was to fulfil soon after: the expulsion of foreigners, the establishment of a tax on the rich, the deprivation of the rights of citizenship of all &quot;anti-social&quot; men, the creation of a French Revolutionary Army, the monitoring of all officers and nobles (i.e.: those of aristocratic families who no longer held status after the abolition of feudalism), and the death penalty for unsuccessful generals fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars.

===Mission and Reign of Terror===
On 15 July he made a violent speech in the Convention in accusation of the Girondists. Sent in August as representative on mission to the of the Nord and of Pas-de-Calais, he showed himself inexorable to all suspects.

On his return, the calamities of the summer of 1793 caused the Paris Commune to begin to organize an insurrection – an insurrection that would lead to Billaud-Varenne&#x27;s ascension to the most powerful body in all of France. When the popular uprising did come on 5 September and the Commune marched on the National Convention, Billaud-Varenne was one of the chief speakers agitating for change in leadership. He called for a new war plan from the Ministry of War and that a new Committee be created to oversee the whole government – thus superseding the existing Committee of Public Safety. To mollify the insurrectionists, that night Billaud-Varenne was named President of the National Convention for a special two week session, followed by him being named to the Committee of Public Safety the next day. Along with Collot d&#x27;Herbois, who was named the same day, his addition was seen as a way to co-opt the Paris Commune. Once added to Committee of Public Safety, he then played a major role in defending it – calling for unity instead of change – on 25 October when the National Convention complained about the committee and then officially sanctioned them. He was included in the Reign of Terror&#x27;s Committee of Public Safety, which had decreed the mass arrest of all suspects and the establishment of a revolutionary army, caused the extraordinary criminal tribunal to be named officially &quot;Revolutionary Tribunal&quot; (on 29 October 1793), demanded the execution of Marie Antoinette, and then attacked Jacques René Hébert and Danton. Meanwhile, he published &quot;Les Éléments du républicanisme&quot;, in which he demanded a division of property among the citizens.

Once named to the committee, Billaud-Varenne became a vocal defender of that body. Based in Paris during much of this year, Billaud-Varenne and Barère worked to develop the administrative apparatus and consolidate the power of the committee. To that end, in early December he proposed a radical centralization of authority, a law that became known as the Law of 14 Frimaire. This law brought surveillance, economic requisition, the dispatch of legislative news, local administrators, and representatives on mission under the control of the committee. He was also instrumental in defending the Terror: when a measure was passed into law in mid November 1793 allowing the accused the right of defense, Billaud-Varenne uttered his famous words in defense of the Terror:
 The law enabling right of defense was overturned the next day.

===Thermidor and exile===

As 1794 progressed, Robespierre began to speak out against over zealous factions: he believed both pro-Terror and indulgent positions were dangerous to the well-being of the Revolution. Robespierre saw danger in members of the Revolution, like Billaud-Varenne, Collot d&#x27;Herbois, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier who had been too committed to attacks on Church property or had been too vigorous in their pursuit of revolutionary justice (such as Collot at Lyon). The dechristianization program was seen as divisive and unnecessary by some in the convention. Furthermore, the law of 22 Prairial had isolated the police wing of the convention: the Committee of General Security, a body that was extremely anti-clerical, had seen their power severely diminished by the law. The law of 22 Prairial reduced the right of defense to simply an appearance before court, while greatly expanding the list of crimes punishable by death. This is what led directly to the Great Terror, in which more were killed by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris in those seven weeks than in the preceding fourteen months. Though Billaud-Varenne publicly defended it in the convention, this law was a driving factor in the eventual reprisal against the committee. Serious arguments began to fracture the committee, with Billaud-Varenne and Collot d&#x27;Herbois pitted against Robespierre and Saint-Just. On 26 June, they argued over the imposition of a new prosecutor to the Revolutionary Tribunal. On 29 June, an argument once again broke out between members of the Committee of Public Safety. Though it could have been about the Catherine Théot affair or the law of 22 Prairial, it led to Billaud-Varenne branding Robespierre a dictator and the latter storming out of the Committee headquarters and ceasing to attend meetings. With tensions being heightened and more guillotined every day – the rate of executions per day in Paris rose from five a day in Germinal to twenty-six a day in Messidor – Billaud-Varenne and Collot d&#x27;Herbois began to fear for their safety.

Throughout the early days of Thermidor, Bertrand Barère attempted to forge compromise between the splintering Committee. However, Robespierre was still convinced that the Convention needed further purging, and on 8 Thermidor he rose before that body to give a speech that would spark the Thermidorian Reaction. Speaking of &quot;monsters&quot; that threatened the Republic with conspiracy, his speech was pointed enough to serve as a warning while being vague enough to worry many in the body. When he was asked for the names of those in the conspiracy, Robespierre declined to provide them, and he was charged with indicting members of the Convention en masse without a hearing.

That night, Robespierre retreated to the Jacobin Club, where he gave the same speech to rousing applause. Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, as members who the speech may have been aimed at, attempted to defend themselves but were shouted down and expelled from the club as cries for &quot;la guillotine,&quot; rained down upon them. They returned to the Committee of Public Safety where they found Saint-Just, the protege of Robespierre, working on a speech he intended to deliver the next day. As one of the chief messengers of the terror, Collot and Billaud-Varenne both assumed that Saint-Just was writing their denunciation. At this moment the last argument of the Committee erupted, with Collot, Billaud-Varenne, and Barère attacking Saint-Just for &quot;dividing the nation.&quot; After sometime, they departed the committee and organized the last elements of the Thermidorian Reaction.

The next day, 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne would play a critical role in the final stroke against Robespierre and his allies. As Saint-Just delivered his speech, he was interrupted near the beginning by another conspirator, Jean-Lambert Tallien. Billaud-Varenne was next to speak, with Collot d&#x27;Herbois controlling the debates from the President&#x27;s Chair, and in an eloquent planned denunciation directly accused Robespierre of a conspiracy against the Republic. This speech and others were warmly received, and after continued debate arrest warrants were issued for Robespierre, Saint-Just, and their allies. After a brief armed standoff, the conspirators would carry the day, and Robespierre and his allies would be executed the next day.

However, after 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne was soon enough to find himself in prison. Too closely associated with the excesses of the Reign of Terror, he was shortly attacked himself in the convention for his ruthlessness, and a commission was appointed to examine his conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee of Public Safety. Billaud-Varenne was arrested, and as a result of the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation to French Guiana, along with Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac, where he picked up farming and took as concubine a black slave girl called Brigitte. After Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s 18 Brumaire coup, he refused the pardon offered by the French Consulate. In 1816 he left Guiana, went to New York City for a few months, and finally moved to Port-au-Prince (Haiti), where he became advisor and counsellor to the high court.

President of Haiti, Alexandre Pétion granted him a pension which he received until his death. Regarding the colonization of Haiti by the Kingdom of France and the attempts of Louis XVIII to regain control of the island by diplomatic means, he announced to Pétion :
He died in Port-au-Prince in 1819. Among his last words, he declared: &quot;My bones, at least, will rest on a land that wants Liberty; but I hear the voice of posterity accusing me of having spared the blood of the tyrants of Europe too much.&quot;

He bequeathed all his possessions to his wife, Brigitte, and expressed it as follows in his will: &quot;I give this surplus, whatever its value may be, to this honest girl; as much to repay her for the immense services she has rendered me for over eighteen years as to acknowledge the new and most complete proof of her unwavering attachment, by consenting to follow me wherever I go.&quot;

<text>Read&#x27;s Island is an island situated just outside the Ancholme sluice, on the Humber Estuary in England. The Lincolnshire Trust suggest it is an artificial island, and a report from 1979 says that it was reclaimed. However, the site was for many years a large sandbank going by the name of &quot;Old Warp&quot; and is shown on the 1734 Customs Map of the Humber where Read&#x27;s Island now lays, and extending further downstream.

A local history website about Barton-Upon-Humber indicates that both are true. It says that two wrecks, including one which locals deliberately scuttled, helped to form the island off South Ferriby. The scuttling was to protect the banks on the southern shore.

In 1872, it was described as being 300 acres, in 1886 it was 491 acres whilst in 2008 it was 200 acres. Flooding in 2007 left the island depleted of areas for avocets to breed, so a programme of rebuilding was instituted.

== History ==
The Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales suggests that Read&#x27;s Island was &#x27;formed of Pudding-Pie sand&#x27; and that it &#x27;took its name from Mr Read of Burton Stather&#x27;.

Grass was then seen growing on Old Warp by the end of the 18th century and cattle were put onto the island to graze. With the Humber Estuary being a drain for a large part of the Midlands, including the River Trent and all of its tributaries, and the River Ouse draining a major part of Yorkshire, England, and being very tidal, it was a simple task and a matter of waiting a few years for some strategically placed piles of bricks and concrete (Warping) to start off this island by allowing the rich silt to build up. It was certainly protected and further land reclaimed from the Humber as its island status grew, and by the 1861 census there was one wooden cottage on the island, with a fresh water well.

=== Military history ===

German prisoners of war rebuilt the brick flood walls during the 1914–1918 war and on the 21 May 1942, an Airspeed Oxford of No 15 PAFU from RAF Kirmington crashed into the east side of the island. On 24 December 1944, a V1 rocket crashed into the mud by Read&#x27;s Island. It was part of a synchronized attack on Manchester by Heinkel He 111 aircraft. The rockets were launched from aircraft to improve their range.

=== Agriculture and human history ===

In 1871, the Humber Conservancy agreed to buy the island from the Crown Estate for a sum of £1434.4s.3d(equivalent to £935,000 in 2015) and the land was rented out to the tenant farmers. The major part of Read&#x27;s Island is in the parish of Winteringham despite the closest village being South Ferriby. It has been occupied at times in the past, at one point as a farm with cattle roaming along it, and when there are particularly high spring tides, at low water, it was possible for the cattle to reach solid ground by walking across the mud at low tide. In the 1930s cattle had to be transported by barge. The island then extended to some and was used for summer grazing. It was locally famous for wildlife and hares.

== Hydrometry ==
Historically, there is an approximate 20-year cycle whereby the main shipping channel alternates from just north of Read&#x27;s Island to the South Channel, between the Island and the shoreline in South Ferriby and Winteringham parishes.

Currently, as the Humber continues to change, the island is in decline. Current thinking suggests that the main (undredged) shipping channel upstream will vary between the island and the north shore and the island and the Humber&#x27;s Lincolnshire shore. This has been attributed to the flow of the freshwater coming down the estuary.

== Ecology ==
Read&#x27;s Island is an RSPB reserve due to its importance for birdlife. Species that migrate or live year-round on the island include ground-nesting avocets (10% of the entire UK population), greylag goose, pink-footed goose, marsh harrier, lapwing, wigeon, curlew, golden plover and fallow deer.

== Toponymy confusion ==
Note that Read&#x27;s Island is the spelling used by the Ordnance Survey and other maps, whilst some spell it Reads Island, and others even Reed&#x27;s or Reeds Island. An ABPmer document even spells it as Reed&#x27;s and Read&#x27;s in the same paragraph. The Read brothers of Burton upon Stather are believed to be the first to graze cattle on the island.

<text>A compound is a word composed of more than one free morpheme. The English language, like many others, uses compounds frequently. English compounds may be classified in several ways, such as the word classes or the semantic relationship of their components.

==History==

English inherits the ability to form compounds from its parent the Proto-Indo-European language and expands on it. Close to two-thirds of the words in the Old English poem Beowulf are found to be compounds. Of all the types of word-formation in English, compounding is said to be the most productive.

==Compound nouns==
Most English compound nouns are noun phrases (i.e. nominal phrases) that include a noun modified by adjectives or noun adjuncts. Due to the English tendency toward conversion, the two classes are not always easily distinguished. Most English compound nouns that consist of more than two words can be constructed recursively by combining two words at a time. Combining &quot;science&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;, and then combining the resulting compound with &quot;writer&quot;, for example, can construct the compound &quot;science fiction writer&quot; or &quot;science-fiction writer&quot;. Some compounds, such as &quot;salt and pepper&quot; or &quot;mother-of-pearl&quot;, cannot be constructed in this way, however.

===Orthography: open, hyphenated, or solid (closed up)===
English uses many open compound nouns, a large subclass of which, by convention in accepted English orthography, are not closed up (not solidified) and are sometimes optionally hyphenated in attributive position (that is, when functioning as a noun adjunct). Examples are &quot;high school&quot;, &quot;kidney disease&quot;, and &quot;file format&quot;. Although some other languages would close up these nouns&#x27; components (for example, German usually does so), English has a tendency whereby it closes up only certain ones, usually only ones in which the head noun is monosyllabic (and even within that category, only sometimes, and in a way that is not fully standardized). For example, &quot;data set&quot; and &quot;dataset&quot;, or &quot;file name&quot; and &quot;filename&quot;, are accepted alternative forms, but &quot;file format&quot;, &quot;data format&quot;, and &quot;data analysis&quot; can only be spelled as open in accepted English orthography. This pattern holds for countless nouns with few exceptions; notice that the latter pair involve multisyllabic heads. For the class with monosyllabic heads, there is a tendency that &quot;compounds tend to solidify as they age,&quot; which is how a term such as &quot;data set&quot; becomes &quot;dataset&quot;, &quot;pin-up&quot; becomes &quot;pinup&quot;, &quot;coal mine&quot; becomes &quot;coalmine&quot;, &quot;bottle cap&quot; becomes &quot;bottlecap&quot;, and so on. Such alternative forms usually continue to coexist in accepted use; style guides often convene on preferred dictionaries as a way of achieving consistency, by declaring that the headword form there will be the default styling for each such term.

===Types of compound nouns===

====Native English compound====
Since English is a mostly analytic language, unlike most other Germanic languages, it creates compounds by concatenating words without case markers. As in other Germanic languages, the compounds may be arbitrarily long. However, this is obscured by the fact that the written representation of long compounds always contains spaces. Short compounds may be written in three different forms, which do not correspond to different pronunciations, though:

*The or form usually consisting of newer combinations or longer words, such as &quot;distance learning&quot;, &quot;player piano&quot;, &quot;ice cream&quot;.
*The form in which two or more words are connected by a hyphen. Are often hyphenated:
** Compounds that contain affixes: &quot;house-build(er)&quot; and &quot;single-mind(ed)(ness)&quot;,
** Adjective–adjective compounds: &quot;blue-green&quot;,
** Verb–verb compounds: &quot;freeze-dried&quot;,
** Compounds that contain articles, prepositions or conjunctions: &quot;rent-a-cop&quot;, &quot;mother-of-pearl&quot; and &quot;salt-and-pepper&quot;.
*The or form in which two usually moderately short words appear together as one. Solid compounds most likely consist of short (monosyllabic) units that often have been established in the language for a long time. Examples are &quot;housewife&quot;, &quot;lawsuit&quot;, &quot;wallpaper&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;.

Usage in the US and in the UK differs and often depends on the individual choice of the writer rather than on a hard-and-fast rule; therefore, spaced, hyphenated, and solid forms may be encountered for the same compound noun, such as the triplets &quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot;&quot;.

====Neo-classical compound====

In addition to this native English compounding, there is the &quot;neo-classical&quot; type, which consists of words derived from Classical Latin, as &quot;&quot;, and those of Ancient Greek origin, such as &quot;&quot;, the components of which are in bound form (connected by connecting vowels, which are most often &quot;-i-&quot; and &quot;-o-&quot; in Classical Latin and Ancient Greek respectively) and cannot stand alone.

===Analyzability (transparency)===
In general, the meaning of a compound noun is a specialization of the meaning of its head. The modifier limits the meaning of the head. This is most obvious in descriptive compounds (known as &quot;karmadharaya&quot; compounds in the Sanskrit tradition), in which the modifier is used in an attributive or appositional manner. A &quot;blackboard&quot; is a particular kind of board, which is (generally) black, for instance.

In determinative compounds, however, the relationship is not attributive. For example, a &quot;footstool&quot; is not a particular type of stool that is like a foot. Rather, it is a &quot;stool for one&#x27;s foot or feet&quot;. (It can be used for sitting on, but that is not its primary purpose.) In a similar manner, an &quot;office manager&quot; is the manager of an office, an &quot;armchair&quot; is a &quot;chair with arms&quot;, and a &quot;raincoat&quot; is a &quot;coat against the rain&quot;. These relationships, which are expressed by prepositions in English, would be expressed by grammatical case in other languages. (Compounds of this type are known as &quot;tatpurusha&quot; in the Sanskrit tradition.)

Both of the above types of compounds are called endocentric compounds because the semantic head is contained within the compound itself—a blackboard is a type of board, for example, and a footstool is a type of stool.

However, in another common type of compound, the exocentric (known as a bahuvrihi compound in the Sanskrit tradition), the semantic head is not explicitly expressed. A &quot;redhead&quot;, for example, is not a kind of head, but is a person &quot;with&quot; red hair. Similarly, a &quot;&quot; is also not a head, but a person with a head that is as hard and unreceptive as a block (i.e. stupid). And a &quot;lionheart&quot; is not a type of heart, but a person with a heart like a lion (in its bravery, courage, fearlessness, etc.).

There is a general way to tell the two apart. In a compound &quot;[X . Y]&quot;:

* Can one substitute Y with a noun that &quot;is&quot; a Y, or a verb that &quot;does&quot; Y? This is an endocentric compound.
* Can one substitute Y with a noun that is &quot;with&quot; Y? This is an exocentric compound.

Exocentric compounds occur more often in adjectives than nouns. A &quot;V-8 car&quot; is a car &quot;with&quot; a V-8 engine rather than a car that &quot;is&quot; a V-8, and a &quot;twenty-five-dollar car&quot; is a car &quot;with&quot; a worth of $25, not a car that &quot;is&quot; $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffixal morpheme is added, such as &quot;-ed&quot;: a &quot;two-legged&quot; person is a person &quot;with&quot; two legs, and this is exocentric.

On the other hand, endocentric adjectives are also frequently formed, using the suffixal morphemes &quot;-ing&quot; or &quot;-er/or&quot;. A &quot;people-carrier&quot; is a clear endocentric determinative compound: it is a thing that &quot;is&quot; a carrier of people. The related adjective, &quot;car-carrying&quot;, is also endocentric: it refers to an object which &quot;is&quot; a carrying-thing (or equivalently, which &quot;does&quot; carry).

These types account for most compound nouns, but there are other, rarer types as well. &quot;Coordinative&quot;, &quot;copulative&quot; or &quot;dvandva&quot; compounds combine elements with a similar meaning, and the compound meaning may be a generalization instead of a specialization. &quot;Bosnia-Herzegovina&quot;, for example, is the combined area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a &quot;fighter-bomber&quot; is an aircraft that is both a fighter and a bomber. &quot;Iterative&quot; or &quot;amredita&quot; compounds repeat a single element, to express repetition or as an emphasis. &quot;Day by day&quot; and &quot;go-go&quot; are examples of this type of compound, which has more than one head.

Analyzability may be further limited by cranberry morphemes and semantic changes. For instance, the word &quot;butterfly&quot;, commonly thought to be a metathesis for &quot;flutter by&quot;, which the bugs do, is actually based on an old wives&#x27; tale that butterflies are small witches that steal butter from window sills. &quot;Cranberry&quot; is a part translation from Low German, which is why we cannot recognize the element &quot;cran&quot; (from the Low German &quot;kraan&quot; or &quot;kroon&quot;, &quot;crane&quot;). The &quot;ladybird&quot; or &quot;ladybug&quot; was named after the Christian expression &quot;our &quot;Lady&quot;, the Virgin Mary&quot;.

In the case of verb+noun compounds, the noun may be either the subject or the object of the verb. In &quot;playboy&quot;, for example, the noun is the subject of the verb (&quot;the boy plays&quot;), whereas it is the object in &quot;callgirl&quot; (&quot;someone calls the girl&quot;).

===Sound patterns===
Stress patterns may distinguish a compound word from a noun phrase consisting of the same component words. For example, a &quot;black board,&quot; adjective plus noun, is any board that is black, and has equal stress on both elements. The compound &quot;blackboard&quot;, on the other hand, though it may have started out historically as &quot;black board&quot;, now is stressed on only the first element, &quot;black&quot;. Thus a compound such as &quot;the White House&quot; normally has a falling intonation which a phrase such as &quot;a white house&quot; does not.

==Compound modifiers==

English compound modifiers are constructed in a very similar way to the compound noun. &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;leftover ingredients&quot;, &quot;gunmetal sheen&quot;, and &quot;green monkey disease&quot; are only a few examples.

A compound modifier is a sequence of modifiers of a noun that function as a single unit. It consists of two or more words (adjectives, gerunds, or nouns) of which the left-hand component modifies the right-hand one, as in &quot;the dark-green dress&quot;: &quot;dark&quot; modifies the &quot;green&quot; that modifies &quot;dress&quot;.

===Solid compound modifiers===
There are some well-established permanent compound modifiers that have become solid over a longer period, especially in American usage: &quot;earsplitting&quot;, &quot;eyecatching&quot;, and &quot;downtown&quot;.

However, in British usage, these, apart from &quot;downtown&quot;, are more likely written with a hyphen: &quot;ear-splitting&quot;, &quot;eye-catching&quot;.

Other solid compound modifiers are for example:
*Numbers that are spelled out and have the suffix &quot;-fold&quot; added: &quot;fifteenfold&quot;, &quot;sixfold&quot;.
*Points of the compass: &quot;northwest&quot;, &quot;northwestern&quot;, &quot;northwesterly&quot;, &quot;northwestwards&quot;. In British usage, the hyphenated and open versions are more common: &quot;north-western&quot;, &quot;north-westerly&quot;, &quot;north west&quot;, &quot;north-westwards&quot;.

=== Hyphenated compound modifiers ===
Major style guides advise consulting a dictionary to determine whether a compound modifier should be hyphenated; the dictionary&#x27;s hyphenation should be followed even when the compound modifier follows a noun (that is, regardless of whether in attributive or predicative position), because they are permanent compounds (whereas the general rule with temporary compounds is that hyphens are omitted in the predicative position because they are used only when necessary to prevent misreading, which is usually only in the attributive position, and even there, only on a case-by-case basis).

Generally, a compound modifier is hyphenated if the hyphen helps the reader differentiate a compound modifier from two adjacent modifiers that modify the noun independently. Compare the following examples:

* &quot;small appliance industry&quot;: a small industry producing appliances
* &quot;small-appliance industry&quot;: an industry producing small appliances

The hyphen is unneeded when capitalization or italicization makes grouping clear:

* &quot;old English scholar&quot;: an old person who is English and a scholar, or an old scholar who studies English
* &quot;Old English scholar&quot;: a scholar of Old English.
* &quot;&quot;De facto&quot; proceedings&quot; (not &quot;de-facto&quot;)

If, however, there is no risk of ambiguities, it may be written without a hyphen: &quot;Sunday morning walk&quot; (a &quot;walk on Sunday morning&quot; is practically the same as a &quot;morning walk on Sunday&quot;).

Hyphenated compound modifiers may have been formed originally by an adjective preceding a noun, when this phrase in turn precedes another noun:
* &quot;Round table&quot; → &quot;round-table discussion&quot;
* &quot;Blue sky&quot; → &quot;blue-sky law&quot;
* &quot;Red light&quot; → &quot;red-light district&quot;
* &quot;Four wheels&quot; → &quot;four-wheel drive&quot; (historically, the singular or root is used, not the plural)

Others may have originated with a verb preceding an adjective or adverb:
* &quot;Feel good&quot; → &quot;feel-good factor&quot;
* &quot;Buy now, pay later&quot; → &quot;buy-now pay-later purchase&quot;

Yet others are created with an original verb preceding a preposition.

* &quot;Stick on&quot; → &quot;stick-on label&quot;
* &quot;Walk on&quot; → &quot;walk-on part&quot;
* &quot;Stand by&quot; → &quot;stand-by fare&quot;
* &quot;Roll on, roll off&quot; → &quot;roll-on roll-off ferry&quot;

The following compound modifiers are &quot;always&quot; hyphenated when they are not written as one word:
* An adjective preceding a noun to which -&quot;d&quot; or -&quot;ed&quot; has been added as a past-participle construction, used before a noun:
** &quot;loud-mouthed hooligan&quot;
** &quot;middle-aged lady&quot;
** &quot;rose-tinted glasses&quot;
* A noun, adjective, or adverb preceding a present participle:
** &quot;an awe-inspiring personality&quot;
** &quot;a long-lasting affair&quot;
** &quot;a far-reaching decision&quot;
* Numbers, whether or not spelled out, that precede a noun:
** &quot;seven-year itch&quot;
** &quot;five-sided polygon&quot;
** &quot;20th-century poem&quot;
** &quot;30-piece band&quot;
** &quot;tenth-storey window&quot;
** &quot;a 20-year-old man&quot; (as a compound modifier) and &quot;the 20-year-old&quot; (as a compound noun)—but &quot;a man, who is 20 years old&quot;
* A numeral with the affix &quot;-fold&quot; has a hyphen (&quot;15-fold&quot;), but when spelled out takes a solid construction (&quot;fifteenfold&quot;).
* Numbers, spelled out or not, with added &quot;-odd&quot;: &quot;sixteen-odd&quot;, &quot;70-odd&quot;.
* Compound modifiers with &quot;high-&quot; or &quot;low-&quot;: &quot;high-level discussion&quot;, &quot;low-price markup&quot;.
* Colours in compounds:
** &quot;a dark-blue sweater&quot;
** &quot;a reddish-orange dress&quot;.
* Fractions as modifiers are hyphenated: &quot;two-thirds majority&quot;, but if numerator or denominator are already hyphenated, the fraction itself does not take a hyphen: &quot;a thirty-three thousandth part&quot;. (Fractions used as nouns have no hyphens: &quot;I ate two thirds of the pie.&quot;)
* Comparatives and superlatives in compound adjectives also take hyphens:
** &quot;the highest-placed competitor&quot;
** &quot;a shorter-term loan&quot;
* However, a construction with &quot;most&quot; is not hyphenated:
** &quot;the most respected member&quot;.
* Compounds including two geographical modifiers:
:* &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot;
: But not
:* &quot;Central American&quot;, which refers to people from a specific geographical region
:* &quot;African American&quot;, as a hyphen is seen to disparage minority populations as a hyphenated ethnicity

The following compound modifiers are not normally hyphenated:

* Compound modifiers that are not hyphenated in the relevant dictionary or that are unambiguous without a hyphen.
* Where there is no risk of ambiguity:
** &quot;a Sunday morning walk&quot;
* Left-hand components of a compound modifier that end in &quot;-ly&quot; and that modify right-hand components that are past participles (ending in -&quot;ed&quot;):
** &quot;a hotly disputed subject&quot;
** &quot;a greatly improved scheme&quot;
** &quot;a distantly related celebrity&quot;
* Compound modifiers that include comparatives and superlatives with &quot;more&quot;, &quot;most&quot;, &quot;less&quot; or &quot;least&quot;:
** &quot;a more recent development&quot;
** &quot;the most respected member&quot;
** &quot;a less opportune moment&quot;
** &quot;the least expected event&quot;
* Ordinarily hyphenated compounds with intensive adverbs in front of adjectives:
** &quot;very much admired classicist&quot;
** &quot;really well accepted proposal&quot;

==Using a group of compound nouns containing the same &quot;head&quot;==

Special rules apply when multiple compound nouns with the same &quot;head&quot; are used together, often with a conjunction (and with hyphens and commas if they are needed).

* The third- and fourth-grade teachers met with the parents.
* Both full- and part-time employees will get raises this year.
* We don&#x27;t see many 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children around here.

==Compound verbs==
A compound verb is usually composed of an adverb and a verb, although other combinations also exist. The term &quot;compound verb&quot; was first used in publication in Grattan and Gurrey&#x27;s &quot;Our Living Language&quot; (1925).

Some compound verbs are difficult to analyze morphologically because several derivations are plausible. &quot;Blacklist&quot;, for instance, might be analyzed as an adjective+verb compound, or as an adjective+noun compound that becomes a verb through zero derivation. Most compound verbs originally have the collective meaning of both components, but some of them later gain additional meanings that may supersede the original, emergent sense. Therefore, sometimes the resultant meanings are seemingly barely related to the original contributors.

Compound verbs composed of a noun and verb are comparatively rare, and the noun is generally not the direct object of the verb.

Examples of compound verbs following the pattern of indirect-object+verb include &quot;&quot;hand wash&quot; (e.g. &quot;you wash it by hand&quot; ~&gt; &quot;you handwash it&quot;), and &quot;breastfeed&quot; (e.g. &quot;she feeds the baby with/by/from her breast&quot; ~&gt; &quot;she breastfeeds the baby&quot;).

Examples of non-existent direct-object+verb compound verbs would be *&quot;bread-bake&quot; (e.g. &quot;they bake bread&quot; ~&gt; *&quot;they bread-bake&quot;) and *&quot;car-drive&quot; (e.g. &quot;they drive a car&quot; ~&gt; *&quot;they car-drive&quot;).

Note the example of a compound like &quot;foxhunt&quot;: although this matches the direct-object+verb pattern, it is &quot;not&quot; grammatically &quot;used&quot; in a sentence as a verb, but rather as a noun (e.g. &quot;they&#x27;re hunting foxes tomorrow&quot; ~&gt; &quot;they&#x27;re going on a foxhunt tomorrow&quot;, but &quot;not&quot; *&quot;they&#x27;re foxhunting tomorrow&quot;&quot;).

===Hyphenation===

Compound verbs with single-syllable modifiers are often solid, or unhyphenated. Those with longer modifiers may originally be hyphenated, but as they became established, they became solid, e.g.

*overhang (English origin)
*counterattack (Latin origin)

There was a tendency in the 18th century to use hyphens excessively, that is, to hyphenate all previously established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished the use of hyphens, while British English is more conservative.

===Phrasal verbs===

English syntax distinguishes between phrasal verbs and adverbial adjuncts. Consider the following sentences:

: &quot;I held up my hand&quot; implies that I raised my hand.
: &quot;I held up the negotiations&quot; implies that I delayed the negotiations.
: &quot;I held up the bank to the highest standard&quot; implies that I demanded model behavior regarding the bank.
: &quot;I held up the bank&quot; implies either (a) that I robbed the bank or (b) that I lifted upward a bank [either literally, as for a toy bank, or figuratively, as in putting a bank forward as an example of something (although usually then the sentence would end with &quot;... as an exemplar.&quot; or similar)].

Each of the foregoing sentences implies a contextually distinguishable meaning of the word, &quot;up,&quot; but the fourth sentence may differ syntactically, depending on whether it intends meaning (a) or (b). Specifically, the first three sentences render &quot;held up&quot; as a phrasal verb that expresses an idiomatic, figurative, or metaphorical sense that depends on the contextual meaning of the particle, &quot;up.&quot; The fourth sentence, however, ambiguously renders &quot;up&quot; either as (a) a particle that complements &quot;held,&quot; or as (b) an adverb that modifies &quot;held.&quot; The ambiguity is minimized by rewording and providing more context to the sentences under discussion:

: &quot;I held my hand up&quot; implies that I raised my hand.
: &quot;I held the negotiations up&quot; implies that I delayed the negotiations.
: &quot;I held the bank up to the highest standard&quot; implies that I expect model behavior regarding the bank.
: &quot;I held the bank up upstairs&quot; implies that I robbed the upstairs bank.
: &quot;I held the bank up the stairs&quot; implies that I lifted a (toy) bank along an upstairs route.

Thus, the fifth sentence renders &quot;up&quot; as the head word of an adverbial prepositional phrase that modifies, the verb, &quot;held&quot;. The first four sentences remain phrasal verbs.

The &quot;Oxford English Grammar&quot; () distinguishes seven types of phrasal verbs in English:

*intransitive phrasal verbs (e.g. &quot;give in&quot;)
*transitive phrasal verbs (e.g. &quot;find out&quot; [&quot;discover&quot;])
*monotransitive prepositional verbs (e.g. &quot;look after&quot; [&quot;care for&quot;])
*doubly transitive prepositional verbs (e.g. &quot;blame&quot; [something] &quot;on&quot; [someone])
*copular prepositional verbs. (e.g. &quot;serve as&quot;)
*monotransitive phrasal-prepositional verbs (e.g. &quot;look up to&quot; [&quot;respect&quot;])
*doubly transitive phrasal-prepositional verbs (e.g. &quot;put&quot; [something] &quot;down to&quot; [someone] [&quot;attribute to&quot;])

English has a number of other kinds of compound verb idioms. There are compound verbs with two verbs (e.g. &quot;make do&quot;). These too can take idiomatic prepositions (e.g. &quot;get rid of&quot;). There are also idiomatic combinations of verb and adjective (e.g. &quot;come true&quot;, &quot;run amok&quot;) and verb and adverb (&quot;make sure&quot;), verb and fixed noun (e.g. &quot;go ape&quot;); and these, too, may have fixed idiomatic prepositions (e.g. &quot;take place on&quot;).

===Misuses of the term===
&quot;Compound verb&quot; is often confused with:
# &quot;verb phrase&quot;/&quot;verbal phrase&quot;—Headed by a verb, many &quot;verbal phrases&quot; are multi-word but some are one-word: a verb (which could be a compound verb).
# &quot;phrasal verb&quot;—A sub-type of verb phrase, which has a Grammatical particle before or after the verb, often having a more or less idiomatic meaning.
# &quot;complex verb&quot;—A type of complex phrase: In linguistics, while both &quot;compound&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; contrast with &quot;simple&quot;, they are not synonymous (&quot;simple&quot; involves a single element, &quot;compound&quot; involves multiple similar elements, &quot;complex&quot; involves multiple dissimilar elements).

<text>Trinity Church is a historic parish in the Episcopal Diocese of New York, whose church is located at 89 Broadway opposite Wall Street, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Known for its centuries of history, prominent location, distinguished architecture and bountiful endowment, Trinity&#x27;s congregation is said to be &quot;high church&quot;, its activities based on the traditions of the Episcopal Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion in missionary outreach, and fellowship. In addition to its main church, Trinity parish maintains two chapels: St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, and the Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion on Governors Island. The Church of the Intercession, the Trinity Chapel Complex and many other of Manhattan&#x27;s Episcopal congregations were once part of Trinity parish. Columbia University was founded on the church&#x27;s grounds as King&#x27;s College in 1754.

The current church building is the third to be constructed for the parish, and was designed by Richard Upjohn in the Gothic Revival style. Trinity&#x27;s first church was a single-story rectangular structure facing the Hudson River, which was constructed in 1698 and destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776. The parish&#x27;s second church was built facing Wall Street and was consecrated in 1790. The third and current church was erected from 1839 to 1846 and was the tallest building in the United States until 1869, as well as the tallest in New York City until 1890. In 1876–1877 a reredos and altar were erected in memory of William Backhouse Astor Sr., to the designs of architect Frederick Clarke Withers, who extended the rear.

The church is adjacent to the Trinity Churchyard, a burial ground, one of three used by the parish. Besides its church and two chapels, Trinity manages real estate properties with a combined worth of over $6 billion . Trinity&#x27;s main church building is a National Historic Landmark as well as a New York City designated landmark. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a NRHP district created in 2007.

== History ==
In 1696, Governor Benjamin Fletcher approved the purchase of land in Lower Manhattan by the Church of England community for construction of a new church. The parish received its charter from King William III on May 6, 1697. Its land grant specified an annual rent of 60 bushels of wheat. The first rector was William Vesey (for whom nearby Vesey Street is named), a protégé of Increase Mather, who served for 49 years until his death in 1746.

===First Trinity Church===
The first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a gambrel roof and small porch, was constructed in 1698, on Wall Street, facing the Hudson River. The land on which it was built was formerly a formal garden and then a burial ground. It was built because in 1696, members of the Church of England (Anglicans) protested to obtain a &quot;charter granting the church legal status&quot; in New York City. According to historical records, Captain William Kidd lent the runner and tackle from his ship for hoisting the stones.

Anne, Queen of England, increased the parish&#x27;s land holdings to in 1705. Later, in 1709, William Huddleston founded Trinity School as the Charity School of the church, and classes were originally held in the steeple of the church. In 1754, King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University) was chartered by King George II of Great Britain, and instruction began with eight students in a school building near the church.
During the American Revolutionary War the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America, following the departure of General George Washington and the Continental Army shortly after Battle of Long Island and subsequent local defeats. Under British occupation clergy were required to be Loyalists, while the parishioners included some members of the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, as well as the First and Second Continental Congresses.

The church was destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776, which started in the Fighting Cocks Tavern, destroying between 400 and 500 buildings and houses, and leaving thousands of New Yorkers homeless. Six days later, most of the city&#x27;s volunteer firemen followed General Washington north. Rev. Charles Inglis served throughout the war and then fled to Nova Scotia at the war&#x27;s end.

The Rev. Samuel Provoost was appointed Rector of Trinity (1784–1800) in 1784, and the New York State Legislature ratified the charter of Trinity Church, deleting the provision that asserted its loyalty to the King of England. Whig patriots were appointed as vestrymen. In 1787, Provoost was consecrated as the first Bishop of the newly formed Diocese of New York. Following his 1789 inauguration at Federal Hall, George Washington attended a service of thanksgiving, presided over by Bishop Provoost, at St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, a chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church. He continued to attend services there until the second Trinity Church was finished in 1790. St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel is currently part of the Parish of Trinity Church and is the oldest public building in continuous use in New York City.

===Second Trinity Church===
Construction on the second Trinity Church building began in 1788; it was consecrated in 1790. St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel was used while the second Trinity Church was being built.

The second Trinity Church was built facing Wall Street; it was 200 feet tall, and longer and wider than its predecessor. Building a bigger church was beneficial because the population of New York City was expanding. The church was torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838–39.

The second Trinity Church was politically significant because President Washington and members of his government often worshiped there. Additional notable parishioners included John Jay and Alexander Hamilton.


===Third Trinity Church===

The third and current Trinity Church began construction in 1839 and was finished in 1846. When the Episcopal Bishop of New York consecrated Trinity Church on Ascension Day (May 1) 1846, its soaring Gothic Revival spire, surmounted by a gilded cross, dominated the skyline of lower Manhattan. Trinity was a welcoming beacon for ships sailing into New York Harbor.

In 1843, Trinity Church&#x27;s expanding parish was divided due to the burgeoning cityscape and to better serve the needs of its parishioners. The newly formed parish would build Grace Church, to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build Trinity Church, the structure that stands today. Both Grace and Trinity Churches were completed and consecrated in 1846.

Trinity Church held the title of tallest building in the United States until 1869, when it was surpassed by St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Old Town, Chicago. Trinity continued to be the tallest in New York City, with its spire and cross, until it was surpassed in 1890 by the New York World Building.

In 1876–1877, a reredos and altar were erected in memory of William Backhouse Astor, Sr., to the designs of architect Frederick Clarke Withers. As the chancel was rearranged, the vestry voted for a one-story rear extension with rooms for the clergy, choir, and a mortuary chapel. The altarpiece was restored as part of the church&#x27;s 21st-century renovation.

On July 10, 1976, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Trinity Church. Vestrymen presented the Queen with a symbolic &quot;back rent&quot; of 279 peppercorns.

&quot;Inspiration, Please!&quot;, a game show aired on Odyssey Network (now Hallmark Channel), taped at Trinity Church in 1995.

==== 21st-century events ====
Following the September 11 attacks, Trinity organized respite services at St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel for first responders and volunteers at Ground Zero, providing meals, medical care, spiritual services, and a place of rest. Memorial items such as cards, banners, clothing, photos, jewelry, stuffed animals, and more were left at St. Paul&#x27;s in the aftermath of the attacks to commemorate those who died. Some of these materials and some of the chapel pews were donated to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.

Falling wreckage knocked over a giant sycamore tree that had stood for nearly a century in the churchyard of St. Paul&#x27;s. Sculptor Steve Tobin used its roots as the base for a bronze sculpture titled &quot;Trinity Root&quot;, which stood in front of Trinity Church at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway until December 2015, when it was moved by the church to its conference center in Connecticut. The move was controversial as it damaged the sculpture, which was later repaired, and the artist objected to its relocation.

Trinity is located near Zuccotti Park, the location of the Occupy Wall Street protests. It offered both moral and practical support to the demonstrators but balked when protesters demanded an encampment on church-owned land called LentSpace, adjoining Juan Pablo Duarte Square in the neighborhood of Hudson Square. The church hierarchy were criticized by others within the Anglican movement, most notably Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On December 17, 2011, occupiers and a few clergy attempted to occupy LentSpace, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. After demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least three Episcopal clergymen and a Roman Catholic nun.

== Architecture ==
The third and present Trinity Church building was built in 1846 and designed by architect Richard Upjohn in the Gothic Revival style. In 1976, the United States Department of the Interior designated Trinity Church a National Historic Landmark because of its architectural significance and its place within the history of New York City.

In 2018, the church began a comprehensive renovation to make the building more accessible and comfortable for worshippers, and to restore historic elements like stained glass windows, clerestory windows, and interior walls. The renovation, approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in January 2018, was designed by MBB Architects.

According to &quot;Traditional Building&quot; magazine, the building &quot;had been added to and altered through the decades in ways that compromised the original architecture, actions that prompted a new master plan and an enormous six-year renovation, restoration, and rejuvenation led by [...] MBB Architects that brings the edifice back to its original glory and transforms it for 21st-century worship.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;The building, which had suffered from deferred maintenance for decades, was systematically pieced back together with restored architecture and ornament, insulated walls and ceilings, new clerestory windows, an accessible chancel with a modified altar and altarpiece, a new vestry room, reimagined sacristy and choir rooms, three new organs, new interior and exterior lighting, and concealed audio-visual equipment for the broadcast of services and concerts.&quot; This restoration effort was recognized in 2022 with a Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award from the New York Landmarks Conservancy. The award program said, &quot;These results have enhanced the worship experience and made the church more welcoming while improving the landmark&#x27;s structure, accessibility, and resilience.&quot;

=== Bells ===
The tower of Trinity Church currently contains 23 bells, the heaviest of which weighs 27 U.S. hundredweight ().

Eight of these bells were cast for the tower of the second church building and were hung for ringing in the English change ringing style. Three more bells were added later. In 1946 these bells were adapted for swing chiming and sounded by electric motors.

A project to install a new ring of 12 additional change ringing bells was initially proposed in 2001 but put on hold in the aftermath of the September attacks, which took place three blocks north of the church. This project came to fruition in 2006, thanks to funding from the Dill Faulkes Educational Trust. These new bells form the first ring of 12 change-ringing bells ever installed in a church in the United States. The installation work was carried out by Taylors, Eayre and Smith of Loughborough, England, in September 2006.
In late 2006, the ringing of the bells for bell practice and tuning caused much concern to local residents, some of whose windows and residences are less than at eye level from the bell tower. The church then built a plywood deck right over the bells and placed shutters on the inside of the bell chamber&#x27;s lancet windows. With the shutters and the plywood deck closed, the sound of the bells outside the tower is minimal. The shutters, and hatches in the plywood deck, are opened for public ringing.

Public ringing takes place before and after 11:15 a.m. Sunday service and on special occasions, such as 9/11 commemorations, weddings, and ticker-tape parades. Details of the individual bells can be found at &quot;Dove&#x27;s Guide for Church Bellringers&quot;.

=== Doors ===
Trinity Church has three sets of impressive bronze doors, donated by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor in memory of his father, John Jacob Astor III. Conceived by Richard Morris Hunt, they date from 1893 and were produced by Karl Bitter (east door), J. Massey Rhind (south door), and Charles Henry Niehaus (north door). The north and east doors each consists of six panels from Church history or the Bible, and the south door depicts the history of New York in its six panels.

=== Art ===
In 2015 Mark Francisco Bozzuti-Jones, a priest at Trinity Church, commissioned Mark Dukes to create the icon Our Lady of Ferguson. In 2022, the church received and installed a new stained-glass window above the main entrance on Broadway. Created by the British stained-glass artist Thomas Denny, the window illustrates both &quot;The Parable of the Talents&quot; and &quot;The Judgment of the Nations&quot; from the gospel according to Matthew.

== Burial grounds ==

==Music and arts==

Trinity Church has a rich music program. &quot;Concerts at One&quot; has been providing live professional classical and contemporary music for the Wall Street community since 1969, and the church has several organized choirs, featured Sunday mornings on WQXR 105.9 FM in New York City. Trinity presents world-class music programs both in New York City and around the world via high definition video streaming.

The mainstay of Trinity&#x27;s music program is The Choir of Trinity Wall Street, a professional ensemble that leads liturgical music at Trinity Church and St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, presents new-music concerts in New York City, produces recordings, and performs in international tours. The Choir is often joined by the Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Trinity&#x27;s ensemble of period instrumentalists, and NOVUS NY, Trinity&#x27;s contemporary music orchestra.

Trinity is also home to a Youth Chorus, Youth Orchestra, Family Choir, Downtown Voices, change bell ringers, and a wide variety of arts programming through Congregational Arts. Visiting choirs from around the world perform at Trinity weekly.

== Property holdings ==
Beginning in the 1780s, the church&#x27;s claim on 62 acres of Queen Anne&#x27;s 1705 grant was contested in the courts by descendants of a 17th-century Dutchwoman, Anneke Jans Bogardus, who, it was claimed, held original title to that property. The basis of the lawsuits was that only five of Bogardus&#x27; six heirs had conveyed the land to the English crown in 1671. Numerous times over the course of six decades, the claimants asserted themselves in court, losing each time. The attempt was even revived in the 20th century. In 1959, the Internal Revenue Service sued over the compensation of the church&#x27;s property manager, but the church prevailed in &quot;Stanton v. United States&quot;.

Disclosure resulting from a lawsuit filed by a parishioner revealed total assets of about $2 billion as of 2011. Although Trinity Church has sold off much of the land that was part of the royal grant from Queen Anne, it is still one of the largest landowners in New York City with 14 acres of Manhattan real estate including of commercial space in Hudson Square. The parish&#x27;s annual revenue from its real estate holdings was $158 million in 2011 with net income of $38 million, making it perhaps one of the richest individual parishes in the world. , Trinity&#x27;s investment portfolio was worth over $6 billion, At the end of 2018, the church&#x27;s total equity was $8.3 billion, and it had $0.6 million in liabilities.

The institution also owns the Trinity Court Building property, where it formerly housed its offices and preschool. That building was demolished in 2015, and a replacement at 76 Trinity Place was completed in 2020. The church was connected to 76 Trinity Place by a footbridge.

Trinity Church owned many tenement-houses in New York City during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

<text>IEEE 802.11e-2005 or 802.11e is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that defines a set of quality of service (QoS) enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the media access control (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical importance for delay-sensitive applications, such as voice over wireless LAN and streaming multimedia. The amendment has been incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.

== Original 802.11 MAC ==
=== Distributed coordination function (DCF) ===

The basic 802.11 MAC layer uses the distributed coordination function (DCF) to share the medium between multiple stations. (DCF) relies on CSMA/CA and optional 802.11 RTS/CTS to share the medium between stations. This has several limitations:
*if many stations attempt to communicate at the same time, many collisions will occur which will lower the available bandwidth and possibly lead to congestive collapse.
*there are no quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. In particular, there is no notion of high or low priority traffic.

=== Point coordination function (PCF) ===

The original 802.11 MAC defines another coordination function called the point coordination function (PCF). This is available only in &quot;infrastructure&quot; mode, where stations are connected to the network through an Access Point (AP). This mode is optional, and only very few APs or Wi-Fi adapters actually implement it. APs send &quot;beacon&quot; frames at regular intervals (usually every 100 TU or 0.1024 second). Between these &quot;beacon&quot; frames, PCF defines two periods: the Contention Free Period (CFP) and the Contention Period (CP). In the CP, DCF is used. In the CFP, the AP sends Contention-Free-Poll (CF-Poll) packets to each station, one at a time, to give them the right to send a packet. The AP is the coordinator. Although this allows for a better management of QoS, PCF does not define classes of traffic as is common with other QoS systems (e.g. 802.1p and DiffServ).

== 802.11e MAC protocol operation ==

The 802.11e enhances the DCF and the PCF, through a new coordination function: the hybrid coordination function (HCF). Within the HCF, there are two methods of channel accessed, similar to those defined in the legacy 802.11 MAC: HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) and Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). Both EDCA and HCCA define Traffic Categories (TC). For example, emails could be assigned to a low priority class, and voice over wireless LAN (VoWLAN) could be assigned to a high priority class.

=== Enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) ===

EDCA is a supported QoS mechanism in 802.11e. With EDCA, high-priority traffic has a higher chance of being sent than low-priority traffic: a station with high priority traffic waits a little less before it sends its packet, on average, than a station with low priority traffic. This is accomplished through the TCMA protocol, which is a variation of CSMA/CA using a shorter arbitration inter-frame space (AIFS) for higher priority packets. The exact values depend on the physical layer that is used to transmit the data. In addition, EDCA provides contention-free access to the channel for a period called a Transmit Opportunity (TXOP). A TXOP is a bounded time interval during which a station can send as many frames as possible (as long as the duration of the transmissions does not extend beyond the maximum duration of the TXOP). If a frame is too large to be transmitted in a single TXOP, it should be fragmented into smaller frames. The use of TXOPs reduces the problem of low rate stations gaining an inordinate amount of channel time in the legacy 802.11 DCF MAC. A TXOP time interval of 0 means it is limited to a single MAC service data unit (MSDU) or MAC management protocol data unit (MMPDU).

The levels of priority in EDCA are called access categories (ACs). The contention window (CW) can be set according to the traffic expected in each access category, with a wider window needed for categories with heavier traffic. The CWmin and CWmax values are calculated from aCWmin and aCWmax values, respectively, that are defined for each physical layer supported by 802.11e.

For a typical of aCWmin=15 and aCWmax=1023, as used, for example, by OFDM (802.11a) and MIMO (802.11n), the resulting values are as following:

ACs map directly from Ethernet-level class of service (CoS) priority levels:
The primary purpose of QoS is to protect high priority data from low priority data. There are also scenarios in which the data needs to be protected from other data of the same class. Admission Control in EDCA address these type of problems. The AP publishes the available bandwidth in beacons. Clients can check the available bandwidth before adding more traffic.

Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) is the Wi-Fi Alliance specification which is a subset of IEEE 802.11e. Certified APs must be enabled for EDCA and TXOP. All other enhancements of 802.11e are optional.

=== HCF controlled channel access (HCCA) ===
The HCF (hybrid coordination function) controlled channel access (HCCA) works a lot like PCF. However, in contrast to PCF, in which the interval between two beacon frames is divided into two periods of CFP and CP, the HCCA allows for CFPs being initiated at almost anytime during a CP. This kind of CFP is called a Controlled Access Phase (CAP) in 802.11e. A CAP is initiated by the AP whenever it wants to send a frame to a station or receive a frame from a station in a contention-free manner. In fact, the CFP is a CAP too. During a CAP, the Hybrid Coordinator (HC)—which is also the AP—controls the access to the medium. During the CP, all stations function in EDCA. The other difference with the PCF is that Traffic Class (TC) and Traffic Streams (TS) are defined. This means that the HC is not limited to per-station queuing and can provide a kind of per-session service. Also, the HC can coordinate these streams or sessions in any fashion it chooses (not just round-robin). Moreover, the stations give info about the lengths of their queues for each Traffic Class (TC). The HC can use this info to give priority to one station over another, or better adjust its scheduling mechanism. Another difference is that stations are given a TXOP: they may send multiple packets in a row, for a given time period selected by the HC. During the CFP, the HC allows stations to send data by sending CF-Poll frames.

HCCA is generally considered the most advanced (and complex) coordination function. With the HCCA, QoS can be configured with great precision. QoS-enabled stations have the ability to request specific transmission parameters (data rate, jitter, etc.) which should allow advanced applications like VoIP and video streaming to work more effectively on a Wi-Fi network.

HCCA support is not mandatory for 802.11e APs. In fact, few (if any) APs currently available are enabled for HCCA. Implementing the HCCA on end stations uses the existing DCF mechanism for channel access (no change to DCF or EDCA operation is needed). Stations only need to be able to respond to poll messages. On the AP side, a scheduler and queuing mechanism is needed.

== Other 802.11e specifications ==
In addition to HCCA, EDCA and TXOP, 802.11e specifies additional optional protocols for enhanced 802.11 MAC layer QoS:

=== Automatic power save delivery ===
In addition to the Power Save Polling mechanism, which was available pre-802.11e, new power save delivery and notification mechanisms have been introduced in 802.11e. APSD (automatic power save delivery) provides two ways to start delivery: ‘scheduled APSD’ (S-APSD) and ‘unscheduled APSD’ (U-APSD). With APSD, multiple frames may be transmitted together by the access point to a power-saving device during a service period. After the end of a service period, the device enters a doze state until next service period. With S-APSD, service periods start according to a predetermined schedule known to the power-saving device, thus allowing the Access Point to transmit its buffered traffic without the need for any signaling. With U-APSD, whenever a frame is sent to the Access Point, a service period is triggered, which allows the access point to send buffered frames in the other direction. U-APSD can take a ‘full’ U-APSD or ‘hybrid’ U-APSD form. With Full U-APSD, all types of frames use U-APSD independently of their priority. With Hybrid U-APSD, either U-APSD or the legacy Power Save Polling mechanism is used, depending on the access category. S-APSD is available for both channel access mechanisms, EDCA and HCCA, while U-APSD is available only for EDCA.

APSD is a more efficient power management method than legacy 802.11 Power Save Polling, leading to lower power consumption, as it reduces both the signaling traffic that would otherwise be needed for delivery of buffered frames to power-saving devices by an AP and the collision rate among power-save polls, typically transmitted immediately after the beacon TIM. S-APSD is more efficient than U-APSD because scheduled service periods reduce contention and because transmission between the access point and a power-saving device starts without the need for any signaling. A power-saving device using U-APSD must generate signaling frames to retrieve buffered traffic in the absence of uplink traffic, as for instance in the case of audio, video, or best effort traffic applications found in today&#x27;s smartphones. U-APSD is attractive for VoIP phones, as data rates are roughly the same in both directions, thus requiring no extra signaling—an uplink voice frame can trigger a service period for the transmission of a downlink voice frame. Hybrid U-APSD is less efficient than Full U-APSD because the Power Save Polling mechanism it employs for some access categories is less efficient than APSD, as explained above. The relative advantages of the various power-save mechanisms have been confirmed independently by simulations.

=== Block acknowledgments ===
Block acknowledgments allow an entire TXOP to be acknowledged in a single frame. This will provide less protocol overhead when longer TXOPs are specified.

=== NoAck ===
In QoS mode, service class for frames to send can have two values: QosAck and QosNoAck. Frames with QosNoAck are not acknowledged. This avoids retransmission of highly time-critical data.

=== Direct Link Setup ===
Direct Link Setup allows direct station-to-station frame transfer within a basic service set. This is designed primarily for consumer use, where station-to-station transfer is more commonly used. For example, when streaming video to a television across the living room, or printing to a wireless printer in the same room, it can be more efficient to send Wi-Fi frames directly between the two communicating devices, instead of using the standard technique of always sending everything via the AP, which involves two radio hops instead of one. Also, If the AP is far away in some distant part of the home, sending all the frames to the AP and back may require them to be sent at a lower transmission rate. However, DLS requires participation from the AP to facilitate the more efficient direct communication, and few, if any, APs have the necessary support for this. Tunnelled Direct Link Setup was published as 802.11z (TDLS), allowing devices to perform more efficient direct station-to-station frame transfers without support from the AP. Both DLS and TDLS require that stations be associated with the same AP. Both DLS and TDLS improve the speed and efficiency of communications between members of a basic service set, but they do not facilitate communication between devices that are near to each other but not associated with the same AP.

Nearby communication between devices not associated with the same AP can be performed using technologies like Wi-Fi Direct, but so far Wi-Fi Direct has not seen widespread adoption.

Microsoft&#x27;s Virtual Wi-Fi initiative was designed to accomplish the same goal as DLS. Virtual Wi-Fi allows gamers to connect wireless while accessing the Internet through an AP by allowing station adapters to have multiple MAC addresses.

<text>The Italian Air Force (; AM, ) is the air force of the Italian Republic. The Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service arm on 28 March 1923 by King Victor Emmanuel III as the (&quot;Royal Air Force&quot;). After World War II, when Italy became a republic following a referendum, the was given its current name. Since its formation, the service has held a prominent role in modern Italian military history. The acrobatic display team is the .

==History==
From 1923 until the end of WW2 the Italian Air Force was called Regia Aeronautica.

===Early history and World War I===
Italy was among the earliest adopters of military aviation. Its air arm dates back to 1884, when the Italian Royal Army () was authorised to acquire its own air component. The Air Service () operated balloons based near Rome.

In 1911, reconnaissance and bombing sorties during the Italo-Turkish War by the &quot;Servizio Aeronautico&quot; represented the first use of heavier-than-air aircraft in armed conflict.

=== and World War II===

On 28 March 1923, the Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service by King Vittorio Emanuele III of the Kingdom of Italy. This air force was known as the (Royal Air Force). During the 1930s, the fledgling was involved in its first military operations, first in Ethiopia in 1935, and later in the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939. After a period of neutrality, Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940 alongside Germany. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; could deploy more than 3,000 aircraft, although fewer than 60% were serviceable. It fought from the icy steppes of Russia to the sands of the North African desert, losing men and machines.

After the armistice of 8 September 1943, Italy was divided into two sides, and the same fate befell the . The Air Force was split into the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force in the south aligned with the Allies, and the pro-Axis in the north until the end of the war. On 8 May 1945, the hostilities ended, beginning the rebirth of military aviation in Italy.

===Birth of and the Cold War===

A popular vote by the people resulted in the end of the Kingdom of Italy and the establishment of the Italian Republic on 18 June 1946. Hence the lost its &quot;Royal&quot; designation, and it became the , a name that it has continued to hold ever since.

The Peace Treaty of Paris of 1947 placed severe restrictions on all of the Italian armed forces, but the establishment of NATO in 1949 with Italy as a founding member brought about the necessity for the modernization of all of the Italian armed forces, including the Italian Air Force. American military aid sent by the Mutual Defense Assistance Program brought about the introduction of American-made P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang propeller-driven fighter planes. In 1952, the Italian Air Force was granted jet fighters for the first time, American F-84G Thunderjets and F-86D Sabres, together with over 200 licence-built British de Havilland Vampires; these were followed by Republic F-84F Thunderstreak fighters and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes from the United States. The reborn Italian aviation industry also began to develop and produce a few indigenous aircraft designs of its own, such as the Fiat G91, the Aermacchi MB-326, the Piaggio Aero P.166 and the line of Agusta-Bell helicopters.

The first supersonic fighters added to the Italian Air Force were American-designed F-104 Starfighters that were produced by a group of several European aircraft companies, including Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm, Dornier, Fiat, Fokker and SABCA. During the 1970s, the Air Force acquired the Italian Aeritalia G222 and the modern American C-130 Hercules tactical transport planes, capable of carrying cargo or paratroopers. It also received the new Aeritalia F-104S Starfighter fighters for ground attack and air-defence purposes.
A push to expand the Italian aircraft industry led Italy into the huge trilateral project that developed the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber and air-defence fighters along with West Germany and the United Kingdom. Tornado fighters were still in service with all three nations, plus a few more, as of 2019. Italian companies worked with the Embraer Company of Brazil in a smaller project to develop and produce the AMX International AMX aircraft.

=== From the end of the Cold War to present day ===
In 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Italy joined the coalition forces, and for the first time in 45 years Italian pilots and aircraft were assigned to combat operations. Needing to replace the obsolete F-104 Starfighters, Italy joined with Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon, which was expected to enter the Italian Air Force in 2000. In 1994, with the Typhoon still some years from introduction to service, 24 Panavia Tornado Air Defense Variant (ADV) interceptors were leased from the United Kingdom for a period of 10 years. The ADV Tornados served as fighter-interceptors to supplement and then to replace the old F-104 Starfighters. However, delays in the production of the Typhoon forced the Italians to seek a supplement, and then replacement, for the leased Tornado ADVs.

With the UK lease due to expire in 2004, the Italian government wished to avoid a costly lease extension and instead opted to lease 34 F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-role fighter planes on multi-year leases from the US. The last of these fighters was returned to the United States in May 2012, following the Italian Air Force&#x27;s acquisition of a sufficient number of Typhoons over a period of several years. The Typhoons are intended to replace all of the F-104, Tornado ADV and F-16 aircraft. The last of the Italian F-104s was withdrawn from service in 2004.

Armed conflicts in Somalia, Mozambique and the nearby Balkans led to the Italian Air Force becoming a participant in multinational air forces, such as that of NATO over the former Yugoslavia, just a few minutes flying time east of the Italian peninsula. The commanders of the Italian Air Force soon saw the need to improve the Italian air defences.

The capability of the Italian Air Force as a transportation unit has been improved with the acquisition of 22 American C-130J tactical transports and 12 Alenia C-27J Spartans, which have replaced all of the G222s. In 2003, the Italian Air Force extended its capabilities to small-scale land warfare by small special-forces units. This was accomplished by forming the 17º Stormo Incursori (&quot;17th Special Operations Wing&quot;), also known as RIAM (, &quot;Air Force Raiders Group&quot;), a unit that is primarily responsible for raids on land-based aeronautical compounds, forward air control missions and combat search and rescue operations.

==Equipment==

As of 2014, the Italian Air Force operates a total active fleet of 557 aerial vehicles, including 209 manned and 12 unmanned combat aircraft, with eight more Eurofighter Typhoon on order and 75 more F-35s planned.

<text>In combinatorics, a matroid is a structure that abstracts and generalizes the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. There are many equivalent ways to define a matroid axiomatically, the most significant being in terms of: independent sets; bases or circuits; rank functions; closure operators; and closed sets or &quot;flats&quot;. In the language of partially ordered sets, a finite simple matroid is equivalent to a geometric lattice.

Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terms used in both linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is the abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields. Matroids have found applications in geometry, topology, combinatorial optimization, network theory, and coding theory.

==Definition== 
There are many equivalent ways to define a (finite) matroid.

=== Independent sets ===
In terms of independence, a finite matroid formula_1 is a pair formula_2, where formula_3 is a finite set (called the &quot;ground set&quot;) and formula_4 is a family of subsets of formula_3 (called the &quot;independent sets&quot;) with the following properties:

* (I1) The empty set is independent, i.e., formula_6.

* (I2) Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e., for each formula_7, if formula_8 then formula_9. This is sometimes called the &quot;hereditary property&quot;, or the &quot;downward-closed&quot; property.

* (I3) If formula_10 and formula_11 are two independent sets (i.e., each set is independent) and formula_10 has more elements than formula_13, then there exists formula_14 such that formula_15 is in formula_16. This is sometimes called the &quot;augmentation property&quot; or the &quot;independent set exchange property&quot;.

The first two properties define a combinatorial structure known as an independence system (or abstract simplicial complex). Actually, assuming (I2), property (I1) is equivalent to the fact that at least one subset of formula_17 is independent, i.e., formula_18.

=== Bases and circuits ===

A subset of the ground set formula_3 that is not independent is called &quot;dependent&quot;. A maximal independent set – that is, an independent set that becomes dependent upon adding any element of formula_17 – is called a &quot;basis&quot; for the matroid. A &quot;circuit&quot; in a matroid formula_1 is a minimal dependent subset of formula_17 – that is, a dependent set whose proper subsets are all independent. The term arises because the circuits of graphic matroids are cycles in the corresponding graphs.

The dependent sets, the bases, or the circuits of a matroid characterize the matroid completely: a set is independent if and only if it is not dependent, if and only if it is a subset of a basis, and if and only if it does not contain a circuit. The collections of dependent sets, of bases, and of circuits each have simple properties that may be taken as axioms for a matroid. For instance, one may define a matroid formula_1 to be a pair formula_24, where formula_3 is a finite set as before and formula_26 is a collection of subsets of formula_27, called &quot;bases&quot;, with the following properties:

* (B1) formula_26 is nonempty.

* (B2) If formula_29 and formula_30 are distinct members of formula_26 and formula_32, then there exists an element formula_33 such that formula_34.

This property (B2) is called the &quot;basis exchange property&quot;. It follows from this property that no member of formula_26 can be a proper subset of any other.

=== Rank functions ===
It is a basic result of matroid theory, directly analogous to a similar theorem of bases in linear algebra, that any two bases of a matroid formula_1 have the same number of elements. This number is called the &quot;rank&quot; If formula_1 is a matroid on formula_17, and formula_10 is a subset of formula_17, then a matroid on formula_29 can be defined by considering a subset of formula_29 to be independent if and only if it is independent in formula_43. This allows us to talk about &quot;submatroids&quot; and about the rank of any subset of formula_27. The rank of a subset formula_10 is given by the &quot;rank function&quot; formula_46 of the matroid, which has the following properties:

*(R1) The value of the rank function is always a non-negative integer.

*(R2) For any subset formula_47, we have formula_48. 

*(R3) For any two subsets formula_49, we have: formula_50. That is, the rank is a submodular function.

*(R4) For any set formula_10 and element formula_52, we have: formula_53. From the first inequality it follows more generally that, if formula_54, then formula_55. That is, rank is a monotonic function.

These properties can be used as one of the alternative definitions of a finite matroid: If formula_56 satisfies these properties, then the independent sets of a matroid over formula_3 can be defined as those subsets formula_29 of formula_17 with formula_60. In the language of partially ordered sets, such a matroid structure is equivalent to the geometric lattice whose elements are the subsets formula_61, partially ordered by inclusion.

The difference formula_62 is called the &quot;nullity&quot; of the subset formula_63. It is the minimum number of elements that must be removed from formula_29 to obtain an independent set. The nullity of formula_17 in formula_66 is called the nullity of formula_43. The difference formula_68 is sometimes called the &quot;corank&quot; of the subset formula_10.

=== Closure operators ===
Let formula_66 be a matroid on a finite set formula_27, with rank function formula_72 as above. The &quot;closure&quot; or &quot;span&quot; formula_73 of a subset formula_10 of formula_17 is the set
:formula_76.
This defines a closure operator formula_77 where formula_78 denotes the power set, with the following properties:

* (C1) For all subsets formula_79 of formula_27, formula_81. 

* (C2) For all subsets formula_82 of formula_27, formula_84. 

* (C3) For all subsets formula_82 and formula_86 of formula_17 with formula_88, formula_89.

* (C4) For all elements formula_90 and formula_91 from formula_17 and all subsets formula_86 of formula_17, if formula_95 then formula_96. 

The first three of these properties are the defining properties of a closure operator. The fourth is sometimes called the &quot;Mac Lane–Steinitz exchange property&quot;. These properties may be taken as another definition of matroid: every function formula_97 that obeys these properties determines a matroid.

=== Flats ===
A set whose closure equals itself is said to be &quot;closed&quot;, or a &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;subspace&quot; of the matroid. A set is closed if it is maximal for its rank, meaning that the addition of any other element to the set would increase the rank. The closed sets of a matroid are characterized by a covering partition property:

* (F1) The whole point set formula_17 is closed.

* (F2) If formula_99 and formula_100 are flats, then formula_101 is a flat.

* (F3) If formula_99 is a flat, then each element of formula_103 is in precisely one of the flats formula_100 that cover formula_99 (meaning that formula_100 properly contains formula_99, but there is no flat formula_108 between formula_99 and formula_100).

The class formula_111 of all flats, partially ordered by set inclusion, forms a matroid lattice. Conversely, every matroid lattice formula_112 forms a matroid over its set formula_17 of atoms under the following closure operator: for a set formula_99 of atoms with join formula_115, 
:formula_116. 
The flats of this matroid correspond one-for-one with the elements of the lattice; the flat corresponding to lattice element formula_117 is the set
:formula_118. 
Thus, the lattice of flats of this matroid is naturally isomorphic to formula_112.

===Hyperplanes===
In a matroid of rank formula_120, a flat of rank formula_121 is called a &quot;hyperplane&quot;. (Hyperplanes are also called &quot;co-atoms&quot; or &quot;copoints&quot;.) These are the maximal proper flats; that is, the only superset of a hyperplane that is also a flat is the set formula_17 of all the elements of the matroid. An equivalent definition is that a coatom is a subset of &quot;E&quot; that does not span &quot;M&quot;, but such that adding any other element to it does make a spanning set.

The family formula_123 of hyperplanes of a matroid has the following properties, which may be taken as yet another axiomatization of matroids:

* (H1) There do not exist distinct sets formula_82 and formula_86 in formula_123 with formula_127. That is, the hyperplanes form a Sperner family.

* (H2) For every formula_128 and distinct formula_129 with formula_130, there exists formula_131 with formula_132.

===Graphoids===

Minty (1966) defined a &quot;graphoid&quot; as a triple formula_133 in which formula_134 and formula_135 are classes of nonempty subsets of formula_112 such that 

*(G1) no element of formula_134 (called a &quot;circuit&quot;) contains another, 

*(G2) no element of formula_135 (called a &quot;cocircuit&quot;) contains another, 

*(G3) no set in formula_134 and set in formula_135 intersect in exactly one element, and 

*(G4) whenever formula_112 is represented as the disjoint union of subsets formula_142 with formula_143 (a singleton set), then either an formula_144 exists such that formula_145 or a formula_146 exists such that formula_147.

He proved that there is a matroid for which formula_134 is the class of circuits and formula_135 is the class of cocircuits. Conversely, if formula_134 and formula_135 are the circuit and cocircuit classes of a matroid formula_66 with ground set formula_27, then formula_154 is a graphoid. Thus, graphoids give a &quot;self-dual cryptomorphic axiomatization&quot; of matroids.

== Examples ==

=== Free matroid ===
Let formula_17 be a finite set. The set of all subsets of formula_17 defines the independent sets of a matroid. It is called the free matroid over formula_17.

===Uniform matroids===
Let formula_17 be a finite set and formula_159 a natural number. One may define a matroid on formula_17 by taking every subset of formula_17 to be a basis. This is known as the &quot;uniform matroid&quot; of rank formula_162. A uniform matroid with rank formula_159 and with formula_164 elements is denoted formula_165. All uniform matroids of rank at least 2 are simple (see ). The uniform matroid of rank 2 on formula_164 points is called the formula_164 &quot;point line&quot;. A matroid is uniform if and only if it has no circuits of size less than one plus the rank of the matroid. The direct sums of uniform matroids are called partition matroids.

In the uniform matroid formula_168, every element is a loop (an element that does not belong to any independent set), and in the uniform matroid formula_169, every element is a coloop (an element that belongs to all bases). The direct sum of matroids of these two types is a partition matroid in which every element is a loop or a coloop; it is called a &quot;discrete matroid&quot;. An equivalent definition of a discrete matroid is a matroid in which every proper, non-empty subset of the ground set formula_17 is a separator.

===Matroids from linear algebra===
Matroid theory developed mainly out of a deep examination of the properties of independence and dimension in vector spaces. There are two ways to present the matroids defined in this way:
: If formula_17 is any finite subset of a vector space formula_172, then we can define a matroid formula_66 on formula_17 by taking the independent sets of formula_66 to be the linearly independent subsets of formula_17.
The validity of the independent set axioms for this matroid follows from the Steinitz exchange lemma.

: If formula_66 is a matroid that can be defined in this way, we say the set formula_17 &quot;represents&quot; formula_66.

: Matroids of this kind are called &quot;vector matroids&quot;.

An important example of a matroid defined in this way is the Fano matroid, a rank three matroid derived from the Fano plane, a finite geometry with seven points (the seven elements of the matroid) and seven lines (the proper nontrivial flats of the matroid). It is a linear matroid whose elements may be described as the seven nonzero points in a three dimensional vector space over the finite field GF(2). However, it is not possible to provide a similar representation for the Fano matroid using the real numbers in place of GF(2).

A matrix formula_10 with entries in a field gives rise to a matroid formula_66 on its set of columns. The dependent sets of columns in the matroid are those that are linearly dependent as vectors.
: This matroid is called the &quot;column matroid&quot; of formula_10, and formula_10 is said to &quot;represent&quot; formula_66.

For instance, the Fano matroid can be represented in this way as a 3 × 7 (0,1) matrix. Column matroids are just vector matroids under another name, but there are often reasons to favor the matrix representation.

A matroid that is equivalent to a vector matroid, although it may be presented differently, is called &quot;representable&quot; or &quot;linear&quot;. If formula_66 is equivalent to a vector matroid over a field formula_186, then we say formula_66 is &quot;representable over&quot; in particular, formula_66 is &quot;real representable&quot; if it is representable over the real numbers. For instance, although a graphic matroid (see below) is presented in terms of a graph, it is also representable by vectors over any field.

A basic problem in matroid theory is to characterize the matroids that may be represented over a given field formula_186; Rota&#x27;s conjecture describes a possible characterization for every finite field. The main results so far are characterizations of binary matroids (those representable over GF(2)) due to Tutte (1950s), of ternary matroids (representable over the 3 element field) due to Reid and Bixby, and separately to Seymour (1970s), and of quaternary matroids (representable over the 4 element field) due to . A proof of Rota&#x27;s conjecture was announced, but not published, in 2014 by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle.

A regular matroid is a matroid that is representable over all possible fields. The Vámos matroid is the simplest example of a matroid that is not representable over any field.

===Matroids from graph theory===
A second original source for the theory of matroids is graph theory.

Every finite graph (or multigraph) formula_190 gives rise to a matroid formula_191 as follows: take as formula_17 the set of all edges in formula_190 and consider a set of edges independent if and only if it is a forest; that is, if it does not contain a simple cycle. Then formula_191 is called a &quot;cycle matroid&quot;. Matroids derived in this way are &quot;graphic matroids&quot;. Not every matroid is graphic, but all matroids on three elements are graphic. Every graphic matroid is regular.

Other matroids on graphs were discovered subsequently:

*The bicircular matroid of a graph is defined by calling a set of edges independent if every connected subset contains at most one cycle.

*In any directed or undirected graph formula_190 let formula_17 and formula_186 be two distinguished sets of vertices. In the set formula_17, define a subset formula_108 to be independent if there are formula_200 vertex-disjoint paths from formula_186 onto formula_108. This defines a matroid on formula_17 called a &quot;gammoid&quot;: a &quot;strict gammoid&quot; is one for which the set formula_17 is the whole vertex set of formula_190.

*In a bipartite graph formula_206, one may form a matroid in which the elements are vertices on one side formula_108 of the bipartition, and the independent subsets are sets of endpoints of matchings of the graph. This is called a &quot;transversal matroid&quot;, and it is a special case of a gammoid. The transversal matroids are the dual matroids to the strict gammoids.

*Graphic matroids have been generalized to matroids from signed graphs, gain graphs, and biased graphs. A graph formula_190 with a distinguished linear class formula_11 of cycles, known as a &quot;biased graph&quot; formula_210, has two matroids, known as the &quot;frame matroid&quot; and the &quot;lift matroid&quot; of the biased graph.

: If every cycle belongs to the distinguished class, these matroids coincide with the cycle matroid of formula_190. If no cycle is distinguished, the frame matroid is the bicircular matroid of formula_190. A signed graph, whose edges are labeled by signs, and a gain graph, which is a graph whose edges are labeled orientably from a group, each give rise to a biased graph and therefore have frame and lift matroids.

*The Laman graphs form the bases of the two dimensional rigidity matroid, a matroid defined in the theory of structural rigidity.

*Let formula_190 be a connected graph and formula_17 be its edge set. Let formula_215 be the collection of subsets formula_186 of formula_17 such that formula_218 is still connected. Then formula_219, whose element set is formula_17 and with formula_215 as its class of independent sets, is a matroid called the &quot;bond matroid&quot; of formula_190.

: The rank function formula_223 is the cyclomatic number of the subgraph induced on the edge subset formula_186, which equals the number of edges outside a maximal forest of that subgraph, and also the number of independent cycles in it.

===Matroids from field extensions===
A third original source of matroid theory is field theory.

An extension of a field gives rise to a matroid: 
: Suppose formula_186 and formula_226 are fields with formula_226 containing formula_186. Let formula_17 be any finite subset of formula_226.
: Define a subset formula_99 of formula_17 to be algebraically independent if the extension field formula_233 has transcendence degree equal to formula_234.

A matroid that is equivalent to a matroid of this kind is called an algebraic matroid. The problem of characterizing algebraic matroids is extremely difficult; little is known about it. The Vámos matroid provides an example of a matroid that is not algebraic.

== Basic constructions ==
There are some standard ways to make new matroids out of old ones.

===Duality===
If formula_1 is a finite matroid, we can define the &quot;orthogonal&quot; or &quot;dual matroid&quot; formula_236 by taking the same underlying set and calling a set a &quot;basis&quot; in formula_237 if and only if its complement is a basis in formula_43. It is not difficult to verify that formula_237 is a matroid and that the dual of formula_237 is formula_43.

The dual can be described equally well in terms of other ways to define a matroid. For instance:

* A set is independent in formula_236 if and only if its complement spans formula_66. 

* A set is a circuit of formula_236 if and only if its complement is a coatom in formula_66. 

* The rank function of the dual is formula_246. 

According to a matroid version of Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, the dual of a graphic matroid formula_1 is a graphic matroid if and only if formula_1 is the matroid of a planar graph. In this case, the dual of formula_1 is the matroid of the dual graph of formula_250. The dual of a vector matroid representable over a particular field formula_251 is also representable over formula_252. The dual of a transversal matroid is a strict gammoid and vice versa.

;Example: The cycle matroid of a graph is the dual matroid of its bond matroid.

===Minors===

If &quot;M&quot; is a matroid with element set &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;E&quot;, the &quot;restriction&quot; of &quot;M&quot; to &quot;S&quot;, written &quot;M&quot; |&quot;S&quot;, is the matroid on the set &quot;S&quot; whose independent sets are the independent sets of &quot;M&quot; that are contained in &quot;S&quot;. Its circuits are the circuits of &quot;M&quot; that are contained in &quot;S&quot; and its rank function is that of &quot;M&quot; restricted to subsets of &quot;S&quot;.

In linear algebra, this corresponds to restricting to the subspace generated by the vectors in &quot;S&quot;. Equivalently if &quot;T&quot; = &quot;M&quot;−&quot;S&quot; this may be termed the &quot;deletion&quot; of &quot;T&quot;, written &quot;M&quot;\&quot;T&quot; or &quot;M&quot;−&quot;T&quot;. The submatroids of &quot;M&quot; are precisely the results of a sequence of deletions: the order is irrelevant.

The dual operation of restriction is contraction. If &quot;T&quot; is a subset of &quot;E&quot;, the &quot;contraction&quot; of &quot;M&quot; by &quot;T&quot;, written &quot;M&quot;/&quot;T&quot;, is the matroid on the underlying set &quot;E − T&quot; whose rank function is formula_253. In linear algebra, this corresponds to looking at the quotient space by the linear space generated by the vectors in &quot;T&quot;, together with the images of the vectors in &quot;E - T&quot;.

A matroid &quot;N&quot; that is obtained from &quot;M&quot; by a sequence of restriction and contraction operations is called a minor of &quot;M&quot;. We say &quot;M&quot; &quot;contains&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;as a minor&quot;. Many important families of matroids may be characterized by the minor-minimal matroids that do not belong to the family; these are called &quot;forbidden&quot; or &quot;excluded minors&quot;.

===Sums and unions===
Let &quot;M&quot; be a matroid with an underlying set of elements &quot;E&quot;, and let &quot;N&quot; be another matroid on an underlying set &quot;F&quot;.
The &quot;direct sum&quot; of matroids &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is the matroid whose underlying set is the disjoint union of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, and whose independent sets are the disjoint unions of an independent set of &quot;M&quot; with an independent set of &quot;N&quot;.

The &quot;union&quot; of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is the matroid whose underlying set is the union (not the disjoint union) of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, and whose independent sets are those subsets that are the union of an independent set in &quot;M&quot; and one in &quot;N&quot;. Usually the term &quot;union&quot; is applied when &quot;E&quot; = &quot;F&quot;, but that assumption is not essential. If &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are disjoint, the union is the direct sum.

== Additional terms == 
Let &quot;M&quot; be a matroid with an underlying set of elements &quot;E&quot;.

* &quot;E&quot; may be called the &quot;ground set&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. Its elements may be called the &quot;points&quot; of &quot;M&quot;.

* A subset of &quot;E&quot; &quot;spans&quot; &quot;M&quot; if its closure is &quot;E&quot;. A set is said to &quot;span&quot; a closed set &quot;K&quot; if its closure is &quot;K&quot;.

* The girth of a matroid is the size of its smallest circuit or dependent set.

* An element that forms a single-element circuit of &quot;M&quot; is called a &quot;loop&quot;. Equivalently, an element is a loop if it belongs to no basis.

* An element that belongs to no circuit is called a &quot;coloop&quot; or &quot;isthmus&quot;. Equivalently, an element is a coloop if it belongs to every basis.

: Loop and coloops are mutually dual.

* If a two-element set {&quot;f, g&quot;} is a circuit of &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are &quot;parallel&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.

* A matroid is called &quot;simple&quot; if it has no circuits consisting of 1 or 2 elements. That is, it has no loops and no parallel elements. The term &quot;combinatorial geometry&quot; is also used. A simple matroid obtained from another matroid &quot;M&quot; by deleting all loops and deleting one element from each 2-element circuit until no 2 element circuits remain is called a &quot;simplification&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. A matroid is &quot;co-simple&quot; if its dual matroid is simple.

* A union of circuits is sometimes called a &quot;cycle&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. A cycle is therefore the complement of a flat of the dual matroid. (This usage conflicts with the common meaning of &quot;cycle&quot; in graph theory.)

* A &quot;separator&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;E&quot; such that formula_254. A &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;non-trivial separator&quot; is a separator that is neither &quot;E&quot; nor the empty set. An &quot;irreducible separator&quot; is a non-empty separator that contains no other non-empty separator. The irreducible separators partition the ground set &quot;E&quot;.

* A matroid that cannot be written as the direct sum of two nonempty matroids, or equivalently that has no proper separators, is called &quot;connected&quot; or &quot;irreducible&quot;. A matroid is connected if and only if its dual is connected.

* A maximal irreducible submatroid of &quot;M&quot; is called a &quot;component&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. A component is the restriction of &quot;M&quot; to an irreducible separator, and contrariwise, the restriction of &quot;M&quot; to an irreducible separator is a component. A separator is a union of components.

* A matroid &quot;M&quot; is called a &quot;frame matroid&quot; if it, or a matroid that contains it, has a basis such that all the points of &quot;M&quot; are contained in the lines that join pairs of basis elements.

* A matroid is called a paving matroid if all of its circuits have size at least equal to its rank.

* The basis polytope formula_255 is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the bases of formula_66

* The independence polytope of formula_66 is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the independent sets of formula_66.

==Algorithms==
Several important combinatorial optimization problems can be solved efficiently on every matroid. In particular:

* Finding a maximum-weight independent set in a weighted matroid can be solved by a greedy algorithm. This fact may even be used to characterize matroids: if a family &quot;F&quot; of sets, closed under taking subsets, has the property that, no matter how the sets are weighted, the greedy algorithm finds a maximum-weight set in the family, then &quot;F&quot; must be the family of independent sets of a matroid.

* The matroid partitioning problem is to partition the elements of a matroid into as few independent sets as possible, and the matroid packing problem is to find as many disjoint spanning sets as possible. Both can be solved in polynomial time, and can be generalized to the problem of computing the rank or finding an independent set in a matroid sum.

* A matroid intersection of two or more matroids on the same ground set is the family of sets that are simultaneously independent in each of the matroids. The problem of finding the largest set, or the maximum weighted set, in the intersection of two matroids can be found in polynomial time, and provides a solution to many other important combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, maximum matching in bipartite graphs can be expressed as a problem of intersecting two partition matroids. However, finding the largest set in an intersection of three or more matroids is NP-complete.

== Matroid software ==
Two standalone systems for calculations with matroids are Kingan&#x27;s Oid and Hlineny&#x27;s Macek. Both of them are open-sourced packages. &quot;Oid&quot; is an interactive, extensible software system for experimenting with matroids. &quot;Macek&quot; is a specialized software system with tools and routines for reasonably efficient combinatorial computations with representable matroids.

Both open source mathematics software systems SAGE and Macaulay2 contain matroid packages. Maple has a package for dealing with matroids since the version 2024.

==Polynomial invariants==
There are two especially significant polynomials associated to a finite matroid &quot;M&quot; on the ground set &quot;E&quot;. Each is a &quot;matroid invariant&quot;, which means that isomorphic matroids have the same polynomial.

===Characteristic polynomial===
The &quot;characteristic polynomial&quot; of &quot;M&quot; – sometimes called the &quot;chromatic polynomial&quot;, although it does not count colorings – is defined to be
:formula_259
or equivalently (as long as the empty set is closed in &quot;M&quot;) as
:formula_260,
where μ denotes the Möbius function of the geometric lattice of the matroid and the sum is taken over all the flats A of the matroid.

* When &quot;M&quot; is the cycle matroid &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of a graph &quot;G&quot;, the characteristic polynomial is a slight transformation of the chromatic polynomial, which is given by χ&quot;G&quot; (λ) = λc&quot;p&quot;&quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) (λ), where &quot;c&quot; is the number of connected components of &quot;G&quot;.

* When &quot;M&quot; is the bond matroid &quot;M&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;) of a graph &quot;G&quot;, the characteristic polynomial equals the flow polynomial of &quot;G&quot;.

* When &quot;M&quot; is the matroid &quot;M&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) of an arrangement &quot;A&quot; of linear hyperplanes in (or &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; where &quot;F&quot; is any field), the characteristic polynomial of the arrangement is given by &quot;p&quot;&quot;A&quot; (λ) = λ&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)&quot;p&quot;&quot;M&quot; (λ).

====Beta invariant====
The &quot;beta invariant&quot; of a matroid, introduced by Crapo (1967), may be expressed in terms of the characteristic polynomial formula_261 as an evaluation of the derivative
:formula_262
or directly as
:formula_263.
The beta invariant is non-negative, and is zero if and only if formula_1 is disconnected, or empty, or a loop. Otherwise it depends only on the lattice of flats of formula_43. If formula_1 has no loops and coloops then formula_267.

===Whitney numbers===
The &quot;Whitney numbers of the first kind&quot; of formula_1 are the coefficients of the powers of formula_269 in the characteristic polynomial. Specifically, the formula_270th Whitney number formula_271 is the coefficient of formula_272 and is the sum of Möbius function values:
:formula_273
summed over flats of the right rank. These numbers alternate in sign, so that formula_274 for formula_275.

The &quot;Whitney numbers of the second kind&quot; of formula_1 are the numbers of flats of each rank. That is, formula_277 is the number of rank formula_270 flats.

The Whitney numbers of both kinds generalize the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind, which are the Whitney numbers of the cycle matroid of the complete graph, and equivalently of the partition lattice. They were named after Hassler Whitney, the (co)founder of matroid theory, by Gian-Carlo Rota. The name has been extended to the similar numbers for finite ranked partially ordered sets.

===Tutte polynomial===
The &quot;Tutte polynomial&quot; of a matroid, formula_279, generalizes the characteristic polynomial to two variables. This gives it more combinatorial interpretations, and also gives it the duality property
:formula_280,
which implies a number of dualities between properties of formula_1 and properties of formula_282. One definition of the Tutte polynomial is
:formula_283.

This expresses the Tutte polynomial as an evaluation of the &quot;co-rank-nullity&quot; or &quot;rank generating polynomial&quot;,
:formula_284.
From this definition it is easy to see that the characteristic polynomial is, up to a simple factor, an evaluation of formula_285, specifically, 
:formula_286.

Another definition is in terms of internal and external activities and a sum over bases, reflecting the fact that formula_287 is the number of bases. This, which sums over fewer subsets but has more complicated terms, was Tutte&#x27;s original definition.

There is a further definition in terms of recursion by deletion and contraction. The deletion-contraction identity is
:formula_288
when formula_289 is neither a loop nor a coloop.
An invariant of matroids (i.e., a function that takes the same value on isomorphic matroids) satisfying this recursion and the multiplicative condition
:formula_290
is said to be a &quot;Tutte-Grothendieck invariant&quot;. The Tutte polynomial is the most general such invariant; that is, the Tutte polynomial is a Tutte-Grothendieck invariant and every such invariant is an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial.

The Tutte polynomial formula_291 of a graph is the Tutte polynomial formula_292 of its cycle matroid.

== Infinite matroids ==

The theory of infinite matroids is much more complicated than that of finite matroids and forms a subject of its own. For a long time, one of the difficulties has been that there were many reasonable and useful definitions, none of which appeared to capture all the important aspects of finite matroid theory. For instance, it seemed to be hard to have bases, circuits, and duality together in one notion of infinite matroids.

The simplest definition of an infinite matroid is to require &quot;finite rank&quot;; that is, the rank of &quot;E&quot; is finite. This theory is similar to that of finite matroids except for the failure of duality due to the fact that the dual of an infinite matroid of finite rank does not have finite rank. Finite-rank matroids include any subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces and of field extensions of finite transcendence degree.

The next simplest infinite generalization is finitary matroids, also known as pregeometries. A matroid with possibly infinite ground set is &quot;finitary&quot; if it has the property that

:formula_293

Equivalently, every dependent set contains a finite dependent set.

Examples are linear dependence of arbitrary subsets of infinite-dimensional vector spaces (but not infinite dependencies as in Hilbert and Banach spaces), and algebraic dependence in arbitrary subsets of field extensions of possibly infinite transcendence degree. Again, the class of finitary matroid is not self-dual, because the dual of a finitary matroid is not finitary.

Finitary infinite matroids are studied in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic with strong ties to algebra.

In the late 1960s matroid theorists asked for a more general notion that shares the different aspects of finite matroids and generalizes their duality. Many notions of infinite matroids were defined in response to this challenge, but the question remained open. One of the approaches examined by D.A. Higgs became known as &quot;B-matroids&quot; and was studied by Higgs, Oxley, and others in the 1960s and 1970s. According to a recent result by , it solves the problem: Arriving at the same notion independently, they provided five equivalent systems of axiom—in terms of independence, bases, circuits, closure and rank. The duality of B-matroids generalizes dualities that can be observed in infinite graphs.

The independence axioms are as follows:

# The empty set is independent.
# Every subset of an independent set is independent.
# For every nonmaximal (under set inclusion) independent set formula_215 and maximal independent set formula_295, there is formula_296 such that formula_297 is independent.
# For every subset formula_82 of the base space, every independent subset formula_215 of formula_82 can be extended to a maximal independent subset of formula_82.

With these axioms, every matroid has a dual.

==History==
Matroid theory was introduced by . It was also independently discovered by Takeo Nakasawa, whose work was forgotten for many years .

In his seminal paper, Whitney provided two axioms for independence, and defined any structure adhering to these axioms to be &quot;matroids&quot;.
His key observation was that these axioms provide an abstraction of &quot;independence&quot; that is common to both graphs and matrices.
Because of this, many of the terms used in matroid theory resemble the terms for their analogous concepts in linear algebra or graph theory.

Almost immediately after Whitney first wrote about matroids, an important article was written by on the relation of matroids to projective geometry. A year later, noted similarities between algebraic and linear dependence in his classic textbook on Modern Algebra.

In the 1940s Richard Rado developed further theory under the name &quot;independence systems&quot; with an eye towards transversal theory, where his name for the subject is still sometimes used.

In the 1950s W.T. Tutte became the foremost figure in matroid theory, a position he retained for many years. His contributions were plentiful, including
* the characterization of binary, regular, and graphic matroids by excluded minors

* the regular-matroid representability theorem

* the theory of chain groups and their matroids

and the tools he used to prove many of his results:

* the &quot;Path theorem&quot;

* &quot;Tutte homotopy theorem&quot; (see, e.g., )

which are so complicated that later theorists have gone to great trouble to eliminate the need for them in proofs.

 and generalized to matroids Tutte&#x27;s &quot;dichromate&quot;, a graphic polynomial now known as the Tutte polynomial (named by Crapo). Their work has recently (especially in the 2000s) been followed by a flood of papers—though not as many as on the Tutte polynomial of a graph.

In 1976 Dominic Welsh published the first comprehensive book on matroid theory.

Paul Seymour&#x27;s decomposition theorem for regular matroids () was the most significant and influential work of the late 1970s and the 1980s.
Another fundamental contribution, by , showed why projective geometries and Dowling geometries play such an important role in matroid theory.

By the 1980s there were many other important contributors, but one should not omit to mention Geoff Whittle&#x27;s extension to ternary matroids of Tutte&#x27;s characterization of binary matroids that are representable over the rationals , perhaps the biggest single contribution of the 1990s.

In the current period (since around 2000) the Matroid Minors Project of Geelen, Gerards, Whittle, and others,
has produced substantial advances in the structure theory of matroids. Many others have also contributed to that part of matroid theory, which (in the first and second decades of the 21st century) is flourishing.

<doc id="244324" wikidata="Q1256684" url="?curid=244324" title="Improper rotation">
<text>In geometry, an improper rotation (also called rotation-reflection, rotoreflection, rotary reflection, or rotoinversion) is an isometry in Euclidean space that is a combination of a rotation about an axis and a reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis. Reflection and inversion are each a special case of improper rotation. Any improper rotation is an affine transformation and, in cases that keep the coordinate origin fixed, a linear transformation.
It is used as a symmetry operation in the context of geometric symmetry, molecular symmetry and crystallography, where an object that is unchanged by a combination of rotation and reflection is said to have &quot;improper rotation symmetry&quot;.

== Three dimensions==

In 3 dimensions, improper rotation is equivalently defined as a combination of rotation about an axis and inversion in a point on the axis. For this reason it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion. The two definitions are equivalent because rotation by an angle θ followed by reflection is the same transformation as rotation by θ + 180° followed by inversion (taking the point of inversion to be in the plane of reflection). In both definitions, the operations commute.

A three-dimensional symmetry that has only one fixed point is necessarily an improper rotation. 

An improper rotation of an object thus produces a rotation of its mirror image. The axis is called the rotation-reflection axis. This is called an &quot;n&quot;-fold improper rotation if the angle of rotation, before or after reflexion, is 360°/&quot;n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; must be even). There are several different systems for naming individual improper rotations:
* In the Schoenflies notation the symbol Sn (German, &quot;&quot;, for &quot;mirror&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; must be even, denotes the symmetry group generated by an &quot;n&quot;-fold improper rotation. For example, the symmetry operation &quot;S&quot;6 is the combination of a rotation of (360°/6)=60° and a mirror plane reflection. (This should not be confused with the same notation for symmetric groups). 
* In Hermann–Mauguin notation the symbol is used for an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotoinversion; i.e., rotation by an angle of rotation of 360°/&quot;n&quot; with inversion. If &quot;n&quot; is even it must be divisible by 4. (Note that would be simply a reflection, and is normally denoted &quot;m&quot;, for &quot;mirror&quot;.) When &quot;n&quot; is odd this corresponds to a 2&quot;n&quot;-fold improper rotation (or rotary reflexion).
* The Coxeter notation for &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is [2&quot;n&quot;+,2+] and , as an index 4 subgroup of [2&quot;n&quot;,2], , generated as the product of 3 reflections.
* The Orbifold notation is &quot;n&quot;×, order 2&quot;n&quot;.
=== Subgroups===
* The direct subgroup of &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;, order &quot;n&quot;, index 2, being the rotoreflection generator applied twice.
* For odd &quot;n&quot;, &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; contains an inversion, denoted &quot;C&quot;i or &quot;S&quot;2. &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is the direct product: &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; × &quot;S&quot;2, if &quot;n&quot; is odd.
* For any &quot;n&quot;, if odd &quot;p&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;/&quot;p&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;, index &quot;p&quot;. For example &quot;S&quot;4 is a subgroup of &quot;S&quot;12, index 3.

==As an indirect isometry ==

In a wider sense, an improper rotation may be defined as any indirect isometry; i.e., an element of E(3)\E+(3): thus it can also be a pure reflection in a plane, or have a glide plane. An indirect isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of −1.

A proper rotation is an ordinary rotation. In the wider sense, a proper rotation is defined as a direct isometry; i.e., an element of E+(3): it can also be the identity, a rotation with a translation along the axis, or a pure translation. A direct isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of 1.

In either the narrower or the wider senses, the composition of two improper rotations is a proper rotation, and the composition of an improper and a proper rotation is an improper rotation.

== Physical systems==
When studying the symmetry of a physical system under an improper rotation (e.g., if a system has a mirror symmetry plane), it is important to distinguish between vectors and pseudovectors (as well as scalars and pseudoscalars, and in general between tensors and pseudotensors), since the latter transform differently under proper and improper rotations (in 3 dimensions, pseudovectors are invariant under inversion).

<doc id="244325" wikidata="Q693827" url="?curid=244325" title="Favela">
<text>Favela () is an umbrella name for several types of impoverished neighborhoods in Brazil. The term, which means slum or ghetto, was first used in the Slum of Providência in the center of Rio de Janeiro in the late 19th century, which was built by soldiers who had lived under the favela trees in Bahia and had nowhere to live following the Canudos War. Some of the last settlements were called &quot;bairros africanos&quot; (African neighborhoods). Over the years, many former enslaved Africans moved in. Even before the first favela came into being, poor citizens were pushed away from the city and forced to live in the far suburbs.

Most modern favelas appeared in the 1970s due to rural exodus, when many people left rural areas of Brazil and moved to cities. Unable to find places to live, many people found themselves in favelas. Census data released in December 2011 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showed that in 2010, about 6 percent of the Brazilian population lived in favelas and other slums. Favelas are located in 323 of the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities.

==History==

The term favela dates back to the late 1800s. At the time, soldiers were brought from the War of Canudos, in the northeastern state of Bahia, to Rio de Janeiro and left with no place to live. When they served in Bahia, those soldiers had been familiar with Canudos&#x27; &quot;Morro da Favela&quot; (&quot;Favela Hill&quot;) – a name referring to &quot;favela&quot;, a skin-irritating tree in the spurge family (&quot;Cnidoscolus quercifolius&quot;) indigenous to Bahia. When they settled on the Providência [Providence] hill in Rio de Janeiro, they nicknamed the place &quot;Favela hill&quot;.

The favelas were formed prior to the dense occupation of cities and the domination of real estate interests. Following the end of slavery and increased urbanization into Brazilian cities, a lot of people from the Brazilian countryside moved to Rio. These new migrants sought work in the city but with little to no money, they could not afford urban housing.

During the 1950s, the favelas grew to such an extent that they were perceived as a problem for the whole society. At the same time the term favela underwent a first institutionalization by becoming a local category for the settlements of the urban poor on hills. However, it was not until 1937 that the favela actually became central to public attention, when the Building Code (Código de Obras) first recognized their very existence in an official document and thus marked the beginning of explicit favela policies.

The housing crisis of the 1940s forced the urban poor to erect hundreds of shantytowns in the suburbs, when favelas replaced tenements as the main type of residence for destitute Cariocas (residents of Rio). The explosive era of favela growth dates from the 1940s, when Getúlio Vargas&#x27;s industrialization drive pulled hundreds of thousands of migrants into the former Federal District, to the 1970s, when shantytowns expanded beyond urban Rio and into the metropolitan periphery.

Urbanization in the 1950s provoked mass migration from the countryside to the cities throughout Brazil by those hoping to take advantage of the economic opportunities urban life provided. Those who moved to Rio de Janeiro chose an inopportune time. The change of Brazil&#x27;s capital from Rio to Brasília in 1960 marked a slow but steady decline for the former, as industry and employment options began to dry up. Unable to find work, and therefore unable to afford housing within the city limits, these new migrants remained in the favelas. Despite their proximity to urban Rio de Janeiro, the city did not extend sanitation, electricity, or other services to the favelas. They soon became associated with extreme poverty and were considered a headache to many citizens and politicians within Rio. 

In the 1970s, Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship pioneered a favela eradication policy, which forced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents. During Carlos Lacerda&#x27;s administration, many were moved to public housing projects such as Cidade de Deus (&quot;City of God&quot;), later popularized in a widely popular feature film of the same name. Poor public planning and insufficient investment by the government led to the disintegration of these projects into new favelas.

By the 1980s, worries about eviction and eradication were beginning to give way to violence associated with the burgeoning drug trade. Changing routes of production and consumption meant that Rio de Janeiro found itself as a transit point for cocaine destined for Europe. Although drugs brought in money, they also accompanied the rise of the small arms trade and of gangs competing for dominance.

While there are Rio favelas which are still essentially ruled by organized crime groups like drug traffickers or by organized crime groups called &quot;milícias&quot; (Brazilian police militias), all of the favelas in Rio&#x27;s South Zone and key favelas in the North Zone are now managed by Pacifying Police Units, known as UPPs. While drug dealing, sporadic gun fights, and residual control from drug lords remain in certain areas, Rio&#x27;s political leaders point out that the UPP is a new paradigm after decades without a government presence in these areas.

Most of the current favelas greatly expanded in the 1970s, as a construction boom in the more affluent districts of Rio de Janeiro initiated a rural exodus of workers from poorer states in Brazil. Since then, favelas have been created under different terms but with similar results.

Communities form in favelas over time and often develop an array of social and religious organizations and forming associations to obtain such services as running water and electricity. Sometimes the residents manage to gain title to the land and then are able to improve their homes. Because of crowding, unsanitary conditions, poor nutrition and pollution, disease is rampant in the poorer favelas and infant mortality rates are high. In addition, favelas situated on hillsides are often at risk from flooding and landslides.

==Public policy towards favelas==

In the late 19th century, the state gave regulatory impetus for the creation of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s first squatter settlement. The soldiers from the War of Canudos (1896-7) were granted permission by Ministry of War to settle on the Providência hill, located between the seaside and centre of the city (Pino 1997). The arrival of former black slaves expanded this settlement and the hill became known as Morro de Providência (Pino 1997). The first wave of formal government intervention was in direct response to the overcrowding and outbreak of disease in Providência and the surrounding slums that had begun to appear through internal migration (Oliveira 1996). The simultaneous immigration of White Europeans to the city in this period generated strong demand for housing near the water and the government responded by &quot;razing&quot; the slums and relocating the slum dwellers to Rio&#x27;s north and south zones (Oliveira 1996, pp. 74). This was the beginning of almost a century of state-sanctioned interventions marked by aggressive eradication policies.

Favelas in the early twentieth century were considered breeding grounds for antisocial behavior and spread of disease. The issue of honor pertaining to legal issues was not even considered for residents of the favelas. After a series of comments and events in the neighborhood of Morro da Cyprianna, during which a local woman Elvira Rodrigues Marques was slandered, the Marques family took it to court. This is a significant change in what the public considered the norm for favela residents, who the upper classes considered devoid of honor altogether.

Following the initial forced re-relocation, favelas were left largely untouched by the government until the 1940s. During this period politicians, under the auspice of national industrialization and poverty alleviation, pushed for high density public housing as an alternative to the favelas (Skidmore 2010). The &quot;Parque Proletário&quot; program relocated favelados to nearby temporary housing while land was cleared for the construction of permanent housing units (Skidmore 2010). In spite of the political assertions of Rio&#x27;s Mayor Henrique Dodsworth, the new public housing estates were never built and the once-temporary housing alternatives began to grow into new and larger favelas (Oliveira 1996). Skidmore (2010) argues that &quot;Parque Proletário&quot; was the basis for the intensified eradication policy of the 1960s and 1970s.

The mass urban migration to Rio de Janeiro in the 1950s resulted in the proliferation of favelas across the urban terrain. In order to deal with the &quot;favela problem&quot; (Portes 1979, pp. 5), the state implemented a full-scale favela removal program in the 1960s and 1970s that resettled favelados to the periphery of the city (Oliveira 1996). According to Anthony (2013), some of the most brutal favela removals in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s history occurred during this period. The military regime of the time provided limited resources to support the transition and favelados struggled to adapt to their new environments that were effectively ostracized communities of poorly built housing, inadequate infrastructure and lacking in public transport connections (Portes 1979). Perlman (2006) points to the state&#x27;s failure in appropriately managing the favelas as the main reason for the rampant violence, drugs and gang problems that ensued in the communities in the following years. The creation of BOPE (Special Police Operations Battalion) in 1978 was the government&#x27;s response to this violence (Pino 1997). BOPE, in their all black military ensemble and weaponry, was Rio&#x27;s attempt to confront violence with an equally opposing entity.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, public policy shifted from eradication to preservation and upgrading of the favelas. The &quot;Favela-Bairro&quot; program, launched in 1993, sought to improve living standards for the favelados (Pamuk and Cavallieri 1998). The program provided basic sanitation services and social services, connected favelas to the formal urban community through a series of street connections and public spaces and legalized land tenure (Pamuk and Cavallieri 1998). Aggressive intervention, however, did not entirely disappear from the public agenda. Stray-bullet killings, drug gangs and general violence were escalating in the favelas and from 1995 to mid-1995, the state approved a joint army-police intervention called &quot;Operação Rio&quot; (Human Rights Watch 1996). &quot;Operação Rio&quot; was the state&#x27;s attempt to regain control of the favelas from the drug factions that were consolidating the social and political vacuum left by previously unsuccessful state policies and interventions (Perlman 2006).

Since 2009, Rio de Janeiro has had walls separating the rich neighborhoods from the favelas, officially to protect the natural environment, but critics charge that the barriers are for economic segregation.

===Pacifying police units===
Beginning in 2008, Pacifying Police Units (, also translated as Police Pacification Unit), abbreviated UPP, began to be implemented within various favelas in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The UPP is a law enforcement and social services program aimed at reclaiming territories controlled by drug traffickers. The program was spearheaded by State Public Security Secretary José Mariano Beltrame with the backing of Rio Governor Sérgio Cabral.

Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s state governor, Sérgio Cabral, traveled to Colombia in 2007 in order to observe public security improvements enacted in the country under Colombian President Álvaro Uribe since 2000. Following his return, he secured US$1.7 billion for the express purpose of security improvement in Rio, particularly in the favelas. In 2008, the state government unveiled a new police force whose rough translation is Pacifying Police Unit (UPP). Recruits receive special training as well as a US$300 monthly bonus. By October 2012, UPPs have been established in 28 favelas, with the stated goal of Rio&#x27;s government to install 40 UPPs by 2014.

The establishment of a UPP within a favela is initially spearheaded by Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s elite police battalion, BOPE, in order to arrest or drive out gang leaders. After generally securing an area of heavy weapons and large drug caches, and establishing a presence over several weeks to several months, the BOPE are then replaced by a new Pacifying Police Unit composed of hundreds of newly trained policemen, who work within a given favela as a permanent presence aimed at community policing.

Suspicion toward the police force is widespread in the favelas, so working from within is a more effective and efficient means of enacting change. Rio&#x27;s Security Chief, José Mariano Beltrame, has stated that the main purpose of the UPPs is more toward stopping armed men from ruling the streets than to put an end to drug trafficking. A 2010 report by the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) did note the drop in the homicide rate within Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s favelas. The report also pointed to the importance of initiatives that combine public security with intra-favela initiatives.

Journalists within Rio studying ballot results from the 2012 municipal elections observed that those living within favelas administered by UPPs distributed their votes among a wider spectrum of candidates compared to areas controlled by drug lords or other organized crime groups such as &quot;milícias&quot;.

More recent rounds of state policy break with the past, as community policing and participatory planning are now cornerstones of Brazilian public policy. Seeking to build on &#x27;Favela-Bairro&#x27;, the informally coined &#x27;Favela Chic&#x27; program was aimed at bringing favelas into the formal social fabric of the city while simultaneously empowering favelados to act as key agents in their communities (Navarro-Sertich 2011). Media outlets have been critical of this change in policy and believe its only reflective of the government&#x27;s concerns of the large media attention Rio attracted during the 2014 FIFA World Cup (McLoughlin 2011) and the 2016 Olympic Games (Griffin 2016). Anthony (2013) was equally as critical of the policy and said that while rhetoric asserted the government&#x27;s best intention, the reality was more in line with aggressive policies of the past. He points to the announcement in 2010 from Rio&#x27;s Mayor Eduardo Paes concerning the removal of two inner city favelas, Morro de Prazeres and Laboriaux, and the forced relocation of its residents.

There have been significant shifts in favela policy in the last century. In 2020, a Civil Police report shows that the city of Rio de Janeiro has 1,413 favelas, all under the control of a parallel armed power (drug trafficking or armed militia). Due to the large scale and complexities of these informal settlements, academic interest into this field remains high.

==Formation of favela society and culture==
The people who live in favelas are known as &quot;favelados&quot; (&quot;inhabitants of favela&quot;). Favelas are associated with poverty. Brazil&#x27;s favelas are the result of the unequal distribution of wealth in the country. Brazil is one of the most economically unequal countries in the world, with the top 10 percent of its population earning 50 percent of the national income and about 8.5 percent of all people living below the poverty line. As a result, residents of favelas are often discriminated against for living in these communities and often experience inequality and exploitation. This stigma that is associated with people living in favelas can lead to difficulty in finding jobs.

The Brazilian government has made several attempts in the 20th century to improve the nation&#x27;s problem of urban poverty. One way was by the eradication of the favelas and favela dwellers that occurred during the 1970s while Brazil was under military governance. These favela eradication programs forcibly removed over 100,000 residents and placed them in public housing projects or back to the rural areas that many emigrated from. Another attempt to deal with urban poverty came by way of gentrification. The government sought to upgrade the favelas and integrate them into the inner city with the newly urbanized upper-middle class. As these &quot;upgraded favelas&quot; became more stable, they began to attract members of the lower-middle class pushing the former favela dwellers onto the streets or outside of the urban center and into the suburbs further away from opportunity and economic advancement. For example: in Rio de Janeiro, the vast majority of the homeless population is black, and part of that can be attributed to favela gentrification and displacement of those in extreme poverty.

The cocaine trade has affected Brazil and in turn its favelas, which tend to be ruled by drug lords. Regular shoot-outs between traffickers and police and other criminals, as well as assorted illegal activities, lead to murder rates in excess of 40 per 100,000 inhabitants in the city of Rio and much higher rates in some Rio favelas. Traffickers ensure that individual residents can guarantee their own safety through their actions and political connections to them. They do this by maintaining order in the favela and giving and receiving reciprocity and respect, thus creating an environment in which critical segments of the local population feel safe despite continuing high levels of violence.

Drug use is highly concentrated in these areas run by local gangs in each highly populated favela. Drug sales run rampant at night when many favelas host their own &quot;baile&quot;, or dance party, where many different social classes can be found. These drug sales make up a business that in some of the occupied areas rakes in as much as US$150 million per month, according to official estimates released by the Rio media.

===Growth and removal of the favelas===
Despite attempts to remove favelas from Brazil&#x27;s major cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the poor population grew at a rapid pace as well as the modern favelas that house them in the end of last century. This is a phenomenon called &quot;favelização&quot; (&quot;favela growth&quot; or &quot;favelisation&quot;). In 1969, there were approximately 300 favelas in Rio de Janeiro; today there are twice as many.

In 1950, only 7 percent of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s population lived in favelas; in the present day this number has grown to 24-25 percent or about one in four people living in a favela. According to national census data, from 1980 to 1990, the overall growth rate of Rio de Janeiro dropped by 8 percent, but the favela population increased by 41 percent. After 1990, the city&#x27;s growth rate leveled off at 7 percent, but the favela population increased by 24 percent. A report released in 2010 by the United Nations, however, shows that Brazil has reduced its slum population by 16%, now corresponding to about 6% of the overall population of the nation.

===Religion===
A number of religious traditions exist in the favelas. Historically, Umbanda and Candomblé are the most prominent religions within favelas, but over the past few decades there has been a shift toward Evangelicalism, including Pentecostalism. While there has been an increase in the number of converts to Evangelicalism, there are also an increasing number of people who claim to be non-religious.

===Music===
Popular types of music in favelas include funk, hip-hop, and Samba. Recently, funk carioca, a type of music popularized in the favelas has also become popular in other parts of the world. This type of music often features samples from other songs. Popular funk artists include MC Naldo and Buchecha &quot;Bailes funk&quot; are forms of dance parties that play this type of funk music and were popularized in favelas. Popular hip hop artist MV Bill is from Cidade de Deus in Rio de Janeiro. Favela Brass is a free music school set up in Pereirão in Rio, which aims to give children opportunities through musical performance.

===Popularization of favela culture===
Media representations of favelas also serve to spread knowledge of favelas, contributing to the growing interest in favelas as tourist locations. In recent years, favela culture has gained popularity as inspiration for art in other parts of the world. Fascination with favela life can be seen in many paintings, photography, and reproductions of favela dwellings. There have also been instances of European nightclubs inspired by favelas.

==Tourism==
Since the mid-1990s, a new form of tourism has emerged in globalizing cities of several so-called developing countries or emerging nations. Visits to the most disadvantaged parts of the city are essential features of this form of tourism. It is mainly composed of guided tours, marketed and operated by professional companies, through these disadvantaged areas. This new form of tourism has often been referred to as slum tourism which can also be seen in areas of South Africa and India.

In Brazil, this new growing market of tourism has evolved in a few particular favelas mostly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, with the largest and most visited favela being Rocinha. This new touristic phenomena has developed into a major segment of touristic exploration.
There are conflicting views on whether or not favela tourism is an ethical practice. These tours draw awareness to the needs of the underprivileged population living in these favelas, while giving tourists access to a side of Rio that often lurks in the shadows. The tours are viewed as a spectacular alternative to mainstream Rio de Janeiro attractions, such as Sugarloaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer. They offer a brief portrayal of Rio&#x27;s hillside communities that are far more than the habitats often misrepresented by drug lords and criminals. For instance, there are tours of the large favela of Rocinha. Directed by trained guides, tourists are driven up the favela in vans, and then explore the community&#x27;s hillside by foot. Guides walk their groups down main streets and point out local hot spots. Most tours stop by a community center or school, which are often funded in part by the tour&#x27;s profits. Tourists are given the opportunity to interact with local members of the community, leaders, and area officials, adding to their impressions of favela life. Depending on the tour, some companies will allow pictures to be taken in predetermined areas, while others prohibit picture-taking completely.
Notable features of said tours include:
* Explanations regarding the mechanisms of socio-geographic differentiation and spatial disparities within a favela (especially rent, the property market, and unemployment)
* Information regarding modern infrastructural equipment (such as wireless LAN, health services) and up-to-date shopping and services infrastructure (e.g. fashion stores, banks, cafés)
* Meetings with voluntary workers on social or cultural projects and/or visits to such projects
* Visits to schools, kindergartens or other institutions serving children and adolescents
* Impressions of private residences, communication with their inhabitants
* Visits to restaurants or café

The Brazilian federal government views favela tourism with high regard. The administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva initiated a program to further implement tourism into the structure of favela economies. The Rio Top Tour Project, inaugurated in August 2010, promotes tourism throughout the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Beginning in Santa Marta, a favela of approximately 5,000 Cariocas, federal aid was administered in order to invigorate the tourism industry. The federal government has dedicated 230 thousand Reais (US$145 thousand) to the project efforts in Santa Marta. English signs indicating the location of attractions are posted throughout the community, samba schools are open, and viewing stations have been constructed so tourists can take advantage of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s vista. Federal and state officials are carrying out marketing strategies and constructing information booths for visitors. Residents have also been trained to serve as tour guides, following the lead of pre-existing favela tour programs. Recently, favelas have been featured in multiple forms of media including movies and video games. The media representation of favelas has increased peoples&#x27; interest in favelas as tourist locations.

<text>John Richard Basehart (August 31, 1914 – September 17, 1984) was an American actor. Known for his &quot;deep, resonant baritone voice and craggy good looks,&quot; he was active in film, theatre and television from 1947 until 1983. He won two National Board of Review Awards, for his performances in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; (1951) and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for &quot;Time Limit&quot; (1957).

Basehart was known to television viewers for starring as Admiral Harriman Nelson on the television science-fiction drama &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1964–68). He also portrayed Wilton Knight in the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;Knight Rider&quot; (1982), and provided the narration that was heard during the opening credits throughout the entire series. He appeared in a number of British and Italian films in the mid-1950s, including Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Strada&quot; and &quot;Il Bidone&quot;. He also narrated a wide range of television and film projects.

In 1960, Basehart received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

Basehart made his Broadway debut in 1938. He won the 1945 New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Most Promising Young Actor for his starring role in John Patrick&#x27;s play &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;, which was adapted into a 1949 film of the same name. He made his film debut with &quot;Repeat Performance&quot; (1947). So confident was Eagle-Lion Films in his performance that the film was first screened in his hometown.

He soon appeared as the killer in the film noir classic &quot;He Walked by Night&quot; (1948) for Eagle-Lion, then he appeared as a psychotic member of the Hatfield clan in &quot;Roseanna McCoy&quot; (1949), as Maximilien Robespierre in the period film noir &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; (1949), as a timid husband in &quot;Tension&quot; (1950), as Ishmael in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), in the drama &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; (1951), George S. Healey in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953) and as Ivan in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958).

One of his most notable film roles was the acrobat and clown known as &quot;the Fool&quot; in the acclaimed Italian film &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), directed by Federico Fellini. He portrayed the title character in &quot;Hitler&quot; (1962), and a high priest in &quot;Kings of the Sun&quot; (1963).

Basehart played a supporting role as a doctor in the feature film &quot;Rage&quot; (1972), a theatrical feature starring and directed by George C. Scott. Also in the 1970s, he co-starred in &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1977).

He accepted the lead role in the 1962 film &quot;Hitler&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Probe 7, Over and Out&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and as Hannibal Applewood, an abusive schoolteacher in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in 1976. In 1972, Basehart appeared in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;, in which Honor Blackman and he played a husband-and-wife theatrical team who accidentally kill Sir Roger Haversham, the producer of their rendition of Macbeth.

<doc id="244332" wikidata="Q7756732" url="?curid=244332" title="The Perishers">
<text>The Perishers was a long-running British comic strip about a group of neighbourhood children and a dog. It was printed in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as a daily strip and first appeared on 19 October 1959. For most of its life it was written by Maurice Dodd (25 October 1922 – 31 December 2005), and was drawn by Dennis Collins until his retirement in 1983, after which it was drawn by Dodd and later by Bill Mevin. When Dodd died, the strip continued with several weeks&#x27; backlog of unpublished strips and some reprints until 10 June 2006. The strip then returned to the Daily Mirror, again as reprints, on 22 February 2010, replacing &quot;Pooch Café&quot;.

Many &quot;Perishers&quot; strips are polyptychs—a single continuous background image is divided into three or four panels and the characters move across it from panel to panel. The story is set in the fairly drab fictional town of Croynge (sometimes spelled Crunge), which is apparently a South London borough. The name is a portmanteau of Croydon and Penge. The location as depicted often resembles an industrial Northern town and may have its roots in how Croydon appeared in the 1950s. Collins&#x27;s artwork in particular gives the town detailed, realistic architecture and a consistent geography.

Thematically, the strip draws upon nostalgia for childhood experiences and often has a static, almost limbo-like atmosphere, in a similar manner to its companion strip in the Daily Mirror, &quot;Andy Capp&quot;. The main characters largely exist independently of &#x27;the real world&#x27; and adults are only rarely seen; for example, every year the Perishers go on holiday but always get thrown off the train home, forcing them to walk and arrive home several weeks late (a joke on how a short scene in comic book time can take several weeks when told in daily instalments), yet with seemingly no repercussions.

==Main characters==
===Wellington===
An orphan boy who lives alone with his large dog, Boot. In the early days of the strip they lived in an approximately diameter concrete pipe section in a seemingly abandoned builder&#x27;s yard. In 1966 he and Boot moved into a small railway station that had been closed by the Beeching Axe, and they have lived there ever since. Wellington takes his nickname from his trademark wellington boots – he cannot afford proper shoes. He named his dog Boot to go with Wellington.

Wellington is quite a solemn intellectual and given to philosophical trains of thought. He can also be quite resourceful – he appears to support himself by selling handmade wooden buggies (or &quot;boobys&quot; as Maisie calls them) and pilfering food from sympathetic local shops, or convoluted schemes to create sudden crowds in order to celebrate his birthday on 25 October (which also happened to be Maurice Dodd&#x27;s birthday). Wellington can also be something of a worrier, always concerned that the world is going to &quot;rack an&#x27; rooney&quot; (rack and ruin). Over the years he has worried that the world is becoming clogged up with dirt, that people might get crushed by the weight of air above their heads, and that each new year might be the same old year recycled to save money. Actually there might be something in that; Wellington has actually noticed that he and his friends never seem to get any older, although this is never followed to its logical conclusion. On those rare occasions when he cheers up, a small raincloud usually appears to dampen his spirits.

===Boot===
An Old English Sheepdog (sort of) who lives with his boy, Wellington. Boot is a generally affable and mellow character, given to flights of fancy and daydreaming. In this respect, Boot is the UK equivalent of Snoopy from Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip. Boot is also convinced that he is in fact an 18th-century English lord enchanted into a dog by a gypsy wench (as he puts it, &quot;I knew I should have bought those damn clothespegs!&quot;) – the strip gives occasional hints that this is actually true as opposed to another fantasy. As a lord, he demands to be treated with respect, and often tells Wellington so to his face. Unfortunately Wellington only hears barking. Wellington thinks Boot is lazy and should help out with the household chores, but Boot usually manages to find some way to &quot;accidentally&quot; mess things up in the hope that he won&#x27;t be asked again. He hates taking baths, and his bathtime struggles with Wellington usually turn into epic battles (Once it cost 2 weeks of school for Wellington) . Boot&#x27;s favourite food appears to be links of sausages, and his attempts to consume these in advance of Wellington provide the basis of many episodes.

Boot was originally drawn with a short tail (on one occasion he met a bob-tailed sheepdog, and on hearing the name decided to call his own tail Fred), but Maurice Dodd later discovered that real Old English Sheepdogs&#x27; tails are docked, and so over the course of several years Collins drew his tail shorter and shorter until it vanished altogether – Boot still appears completely white, rare for the breed.

&quot;Who is the Mother of Boot?&quot; was a long-running mystery until a reader informed Wellington that Boot&#x27;s dam was named &quot;Cherry Blossom.&quot; (&quot;Cherry Blossom&quot; happens to be a well-known brand of shoe and boot polish). Additionally, Boot&#x27;s sire is called T.O.E.cap, and was a Gun dog.

===Marlon===
Marlon is amiable but he is not very bright. This has not dampened his ambitions; he is enthusiastic and often tries his hand at inventing. The fact that most of his inventions – fire, the wheel, the horse and cart and so forth – had already been invented did not deter him, because he felt he was slowly catching up. He also claimed to have invented a &quot;micro-stetho-deeposcope&quot; – supposedly a high-tech instrument for probing deeply below the earth&#x27;s surface, but which actually turned out to be a piece of broken mirror tied to a chair leg.

One of his culinary inventions did make a splash – literally: the inch-thick ketchup sandwich (subsequently renamed the thick ketchup sandwich when Marlon decided to go metric). The splash in question occurred whenever he bit into one, caused by a huge dollop of ketchup hitting whoever happened to be standing nearby. The ketchup sandwich is used as a recurring gag, occasionally replaced with other types of filling for variety.

Marlon also dreams of becoming either a brain surgeon (which is spelt &quot;brane surgeon&quot; in his speech balloons), or &quot;a bloke wot goes down sewers in big rubber boots&quot; – he considers either career to be equally prestigious. In the meantime he spends his pocket money on Wellington&#x27;s buggies, which usually results in a battle between Wellington&#x27;s persuasive skills and Maisie&#x27;s desire for him to spend the money on her.

===Maisie===
An adorable little girl – at least, according to her. In fact she is domineering and a bully, with a tendency to become violent if she doesn&#x27;t get her own way, and a scream that can stun woodworm. She is scared of insects and spiders; on one occasion, when Wellington tells her that the field they are walking through may contain thousands of hidden insects, she is too terrified to move.

She has convinced herself she is in love with Marlon and continues to pursue him despite his continual resistance – their relationship has been described as a &quot;one sided love triangle&quot;. She imagines herself and Marlon as the heroine and hero of a romantic novel – he bold as a hawk, she soft as a dove. In reality, of course, she is tough as nails and he is thick as a plank.

Another character trait of hers is a fondness for paper bags (and the contents thereof). It is usually Wellington who has just managed to scrape together enough money for sweets or fish and chips, which he has then to hide lest a rustle attract Maisie, who will appear, as if from nowhere, to inquire: &quot;Need any help with that paper bag?&quot;

Maisie bears a resemblance to Lucy van Pelt in Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip. The British actress Maisie Williams was christened Margaret but has always been known as Maisie, after the character.

===Baby Grumpling===
A toddler, possibly named after the &quot;Baby Dumpling&quot; character in the US comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;. In the early days of the strip he did not speak, because he knew that once he started he would be expected to keep talking all the time. When he finally began to speak he did so in entirely in lower-case letters.

In the early days of the strip he was not related to the other characters, but was later revealed to be Maisie&#x27;s little brother (a retcon – in an earlier strip Maisie had referred to Baby Grumpling&#x27;s parents as if they were not her own). He used to think that school was a prison from which the older Perishers were temporarily released each evening. He digs a lot of holes, which he always blames on worms (a significant part of his diet) or moles. He enjoys creating mischief with his space hopper, or by putting insects into Maisie&#x27;s underwear drawer, when he isn&#x27;t embarking on some improbable business venture or other (usually worm-related; he invented the wormburger, for instance, though nobody but Wellington ever bought one, and Wellington didn&#x27;t initially believe it had real worms in it).

He often discusses philosophy with the new baby (an unseen character in a pram). He is also frequently seen questioning the plausibility of fairy tales or nursery rhymes read out by Maisie, while at the same time vandalising an alarm clock or other household item. His teddy bear Gladly (short for &quot;Gladly, my cross-eyed bear&quot;) puts in occasional appearances.

==Recurring characters==
Not all of these characters appeared during the same time periods

* The Crabs: The crustacean inhabitants of a seaside rock pool, visited by Boot every year during the Perishers&#x27; summer holiday. Some of the crabs believe that Boot&#x27;s eyes peering down at them annually are a mystical visitation – &quot;The Eyeballs in the Sky&quot; – and this belief is exploited by a preacher crab who uses their appearance as an excuse to extort money from his congregation. His efforts are always opposed by a scientist crab who continually attempts to invent a device to break through the surface of the pool and investigate what the &quot;Eyeballs&quot; really are, despite the preacher&#x27;s protests that he will &quot;rend the fabric of the pooliverse&quot;. The conflict usually ends up in a full-scale crab fight, and Boot is left none the wiser as to crustacean behaviour. Usually, one of the crabs claims that something is &quot;bad fer y&#x27;r &#x27;ealth&quot;.
*Plain Jane: a cross-eyed friend of Maisie&#x27;s, often seen selling potions and tonics from a home-made stall.
*Fiscal Yere: a millionaire&#x27;s son who always complains about the problems of being rich, whilst maintaining his chocolate cigar habit to the others&#x27; chagrin.
*Fred Beetle and the Caterpillar: a pair of insects often encountered by Boot. Fred is a socialist who seems to be modelled on Fred Kite from &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;. The Caterpillar&#x27;s chain-smoking habit has stunted his growth and prevented his metamorphosis into a butterfly. This is just as well since he doesn&#x27;t like heights. The &quot;Cat&quot;erpillar, apparently, is a &quot;meowist&quot;, and is depicted when it first appeared as meowing about. 
*Adolf Kilroy: a tortoise shaped like a World War 2 German helmet. He thinks he is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and speaks in Fraktur. He sometimes teams up with Fred Beetle and Caterpillar in an attempt to overthrow Boot, but the fact that Boot is much bigger always defeats them. This character last appeared in the summer of 1983 and it is said upon his 1984 take-over of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Robert Maxwell, a Czech whose family had been murdered by Nazi German troops during the war, objected to the Kilroy character appearing in the strip.
*B. H. (Calcutta) Failed: a kindly Indian bloodhound who lost his sense of smell in an unfortunate incident involving an elephant filled with curry which exploded in the noonday sun. B. H. literally bumped into Boot one day, and they have been good friends ever since, despite B. H.&#x27;s frequent attempts to steal Boot&#x27;s meat bones. One of the strip&#x27;s odder elements is B.H.&#x27;s claim to be a reporter for &quot;The West Crunge Clarion and Dubious Advertiser&quot;, a low budget and downmarket local newspaper. He has a journalist&#x27;s ear for an attention-grabbing headline, but his career may be held back by his inability to remember how to make the letter &quot;b&quot;.
*Tatty Oldbitt (the Sailors&#x27; Friend): an over-amorous female basset hound who likes to chase sailors (and other dogs) – although just what she intends to &quot;do&quot; if she catches one is probably best left unexplored. She also chases Boot from time to time, but since he considers himself a lord she never gets very far with him, and often ends up going off with B. H. instead.
*Dirty McSquirty: the dirtiest boy in town, always accompanied by a cloud of flies. He resembles Pig-Pen in Charles Schultz&#x27;s Peanuts strip.
*Cousin Worsoff: an unseen character. Dirty McSquirty&#x27;s cousin, he is the proverbial &quot;person who is worse off than you&quot;. He lives in the sewer, and Dirty speaks to him through drain covers.
*Poor girl: a girl who harasses Wellington with constant tales of poverty, despite wearing an impressive fur coat and claiming to have a household full of equally impoverished staff.
*Beryl Bogey: a large and physically intimidating dim-witted girl, or possibly gorilla, whose presence on Maisie&#x27;s netball team gives them the ability to break down the opposition, literally. Her idol is King Kong.
*The cat: an unnamed cat recently adopted by Wellington, much to Boot&#x27;s annoyance. The cat and Boot are engaged in a permanent battle of wits.
*The goldfish: another new pet of Wellington&#x27;s. Contemplates philosophy while swimming around in his tiny bowl.
*The water-snail: the most recent arrival, bought by Wellington to clean the goldfish&#x27;s bowl. The snail considers this a degrading job.
*The Ghengis St. Gang: An always-unseen rival gang of children. In general the Perishers argue about how to respond (run or fight) and are usually beaten up while trying to decide what to do.

==Catch phrases==
This is a partial list of the phrases coined or made popular by the Perishers.
* &quot;Go-faster stripes&quot; – Wellington&#x27;s big selling-point on the buggies he tries to persuade Marlon to buy. It has become a way of describing any useless or frivolous addition to a product.
* &quot;GRONFF!!&quot; – The sound of Boot gobbling up something tasty, often something meant for another character, once the contents of a bird table. Also used sometimes when other characters eat.
* &quot; Parasite! Trotskyite! Marmite!&quot; – Insults hurled at each other by the Beetle and the Caterpillar whenever they brawl, which is frequently. Marmite is, of course, not exactly a valid insult, but does end in &quot;-ite&quot;.
* &quot;Vilson Kepple und Betty!&quot; – Kilroy the Tortoise&#x27;s favourite exclamation. It derives from the music hall stage act Wilson, Keppel and Betty.
* &quot;Need any help with that paper bag?&quot; – Maisie can detect the opening of a bag of crisps from far away, appearing almost instantly to help with the consumption of the contents, uttering this phrase as soon as she arrives.
* &quot;Yeuk!!&quot; – Marlon&#x27;s reaction to Maisie&#x27;s perennial romantic advances. He responds to her in this way so often that Maisie has actually asked Marlon, &quot;Is &#x27;yeuk&#x27; the only word you know?&quot;
* &quot;Ratbag&quot; – The kids&#x27; favourite insult. Absent from the very early days of the strip, it quickly became a staple. Maisie is particularly fond of the word, and constantly uses it to refer to Marlon.
* &quot;Berk&quot; – New Baby&#x27;s final response to anything said to it by Baby Grumpling. Might be construed as calling him a berk, but is intended as baby noise.

==Final strip and editorial comment==
A final, specially drawn strip appeared on the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s comic page on Saturday 10 June 2006. The strip depicts the silhouetted figures of Maisie, Baby Grumpling, Wellington, Boot and Marlon walking down a street into the sunset. Wellington says, &quot;Well, dear readers, it&#x27;s taken almost fifty years for you to see the back of us. In sayin&#x27; goodbye we hope that you remember us with the affecshun we feel for you.&quot; The tone of the strip is reminiscent of Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s final &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, from which the Perishers strip took its inspiration.

The strip was initially replaced by the short-lived &quot;Ronaldinho&quot;, during the then-ongoing World Cup. After the tournament, the American &quot;Pooch Cafe&quot; appeared as a more permanent replacement.

==Annuals==
Regular collections of the strip were published in book form. The first Perishers book was issued in the UK in 1963, often referred to as &#x27;Meet the Perishers&#x27; but was in fact just titled &#x27;The Perishers&#x27;. The second issue, &#x27;The Perishers Strike Again&#x27;, was published two years later in 1965. Further issues were then mostly published at the rate of two per year, commencing in 1968 (exceptions being three issued in 1972, and one in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977). A total of 27 annuals were released, the last being published in 1981.

In 1974, in addition to the regular book, an omnibus collection of previously published strips was issued, followed by two further omnibus collections in 1975 and 1976.

==Reprints==
After a gap of nearly four years, the original cartoon strip returned to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as reprints, on 22 February 2010 due to popular demand.

==Animation==

In 1979, 20 five-minute animated shorts featuring the strip&#x27;s characters were made by Bill Melendez Productions (coincidentally, the same studio behind the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated specials) for the BBC.

==LP record==
Around 1980 an LP record album entitled &quot;THE PERISHERS SING! (WELL SORT OF)&quot; was issued by Response Records, with lyrics written by Maurice Dodd and music by Trevor Evan Jones. An instrumental version of the final track &quot;It&#x27;s Great to be a Kid&quot; was also the theme music for the animated TV version. Dodd&#x27;s official website claims 12 songs were penned, but the finished album only contained 10 tracks. It featured narration by Bernard Cribbins, and also credits Nicky James and Barbara Sexton with vocals.

<text>Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman (19 May 1928 – 16 December 1982) was an English design engineer, inventor, and builder in the automotive industry, and founder of the sports car company Lotus Cars.

Chapman founded Lotus in 1952 and initially ran Lotus in his spare time, assisted by a group of enthusiasts. His knowledge of the latest aeronautical engineering techniques would prove vital towards achieving the major automotive technical advances for which he is remembered. Chapman&#x27;s design philosophy focused on cars with light weight and fine handling instead of bulking up on horsepower and spring rates, which he famously summarised as &quot;Adding power makes you faster on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.&quot;

Team Lotus won seven Formula One Constructors&#x27; titles, six Drivers&#x27; Championships, and the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, between 1962 and 1978 under his direction. The production side of Lotus Cars has built tens of thousands of relatively affordable, cutting edge sports cars. Lotus is one of but a handful of English performance car builders still in business after the industrial decline of the 1970s.

Chapman suffered a fatal heart attack in 1982, aged 54.

==Early life==
Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman was born on 19 May 1928 in Richmond, Surrey, and brought up at 44 Beech Drive, on the border of Muswell Hill in London N2. His father ran The Railway Hotel on Tottenham Lane next to Hornsey Railway Station. Chapman attended the Stationers&#x27; Company&#x27;s School in Mayfield Road.

==Education==
Chapman studied structural engineering at University College London, joining the University of London Air Squadron and learning to fly. He left UCL without a degree in 1948, resitting his final mathematics paper in 1949 and obtaining his degree a year late.

Chapman briefly joined the Royal Air Force in 1948, being offered a permanent commission but turning this down in favour of a swift return to civilian life. After a couple of false starts Chapman joined the British Aluminium company, using his civil engineering skills to attempt to sell aluminium as a viable structural material for buildings.

==Career==
In 1948, Chapman designed the Mk1, a modified Austin 7, which he entered privately into local racing events. He named the car &quot;Lotus&quot;; he never confirmed the reason, but one of several theories is that it was after his then-girlfriend (later wife) Hazel, whom he nicknamed &quot;Lotus blossom&quot;. With the prize money, he developed the Lotus Mk2. Around this time, Chapman began to show his ability to think of ways to become more competitive while remaining within the rules. One early car had a 6 port head with 4 exhaust and two inlet ports. Chapman realised that better flow characteristics (and therefore more power) could be achieved with an 8 port head, but lacking the resources to have one made, he reversed the port functions and de-siamesed the old inlet ports. With appropriate manifolds and a new camshaft, his engine outclassed the opposition until the rules were changed to outlaw the specific changes he had made. With continuing success on through the Lotus 6, he began to sell kits of these cars. Over 100 were sold through 1956. It was with the Lotus 7 in 1957 that things really took off, and indeed Caterham Cars still manufacture a version of that car today – the Caterham 7; there have been over 90 different Lotus 7 clones, replicas and derivatives offered to the public by a variety of makers.

In the 1950s, Chapman progressed through the motor racing formulae, designing and building a series of racing cars, sometimes to the point of maintaining limited production as they were so successful and highly sought after, until he arrived in Formula One. Besides his engineering work, he also piloted a Vanwall F1-car in 1956 but crashed into his teammate Mike Hawthorn during practice for the French Grand Prix at Reims, ending his career as a race driver and focusing him on the technical side. Along with John Cooper, he revolutionised the premier motor sport. Their small, lightweight mid-engined vehicles gave away much in terms of power, but superior handling meant their competing cars often beat the all-conquering front engined Ferraris and Maseratis. Eventually, with driver Jim Clark at the wheel of his race cars, Team Lotus appeared as though they could win whenever they pleased. With Clark driving the Lotus 25, Team Lotus won its first F1 World Championship in 1963. It was Clark, driving a Lotus 38 at the Indianapolis 500 in 1965, who drove the first-ever mid-engined car to victory at the &quot;Brickyard&quot;. Clark and Chapman became particularly close and Clark&#x27;s death in 1968 devastated Chapman, who publicly stated that he had lost his best friend. Among a number of automotive figures who have been Lotus employees over the years were Cosworth founders Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth, and Graham Hill who worked at Lotus as a mechanic as a means of earning drives. In 1966, it was Chapman who persuaded the Ford Motor Company to sponsor Cosworth&#x27;s development of what would become the DFV race engine.

==Innovations and legacy==
Many of Chapman&#x27;s ideas can still be seen in Formula One and other top-level motor sport, such as IndyCars, into the 21st century. He pioneered the use of struts as a rear suspension device. Struts used in the rear of a vehicle are known as Chapman struts, while virtually identical suspension struts for the front are known as MacPherson struts that were invented ten years earlier in 1949.

Chapman&#x27;s next major innovation was popularising monocoque chassis construction within automobile racing, with the revolutionary 1962 Lotus 25 Formula One car. The technique resulted in a body that was both lighter and stronger, and also provided better driver protection in the event of a crash. Although a previously little-used concept in the world of motorsport, the first vehicle to feature such a chassis was the road-going 1922 Lancia Lambda. Lotus had been an early adopter of this technology with the 1958 Lotus Elite. The modified monocoque body of the car was made of fibreglass, making it also one of the first production cars made of composite materials.

When American Formula One driver Dan Gurney first saw the Lotus 25 at the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, he was so struck by the advanced design that he invited Chapman to the 1962 Indianapolis 500, where Gurney made his Indy début at the wheel of a space-frame rear engined car designed by John Crosthwaite (who had previously worked for Chapman) and built by American hot-rodder Mickey Thompson. Following the race, Chapman prepared a proposal to Ford Motor Company for an aluminium alloy monocoque Indianapolis car using a 4.2-litre aluminium V-8 Ford passenger car engine. Ford accepted the proposal. The Lotus 29 debuted at Indianapolis in 1963, with Jim Clark finishing second. This design concept fairly quickly replaced what had been for many decades the standard design formula in racing-cars, the tube-frame chassis. Although the material has changed from sheet aluminium to carbon fibre, this remains today the standard technique for building top-level racing cars.

Inspired by Jim Hall, Chapman was among those who helped introduce aerodynamics into Formula One car design. Lotus used the concept of positive aerodynamic downforce, through the addition of wings, at a Tasman Formula race in early 1968, although Ferrari and Brabham were the first to use them in a Formula One race at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix. Early versions, in 1968 and 1969, were mounted or so above the car, to operate in &#x27;clean air&#x27; (air that would not otherwise be disturbed by the passage of the car). The underdesigned wings and struts failed regularly, however, compelling the FIA to require the wing mounting hardware to be attached directly to the sprung chassis. Chapman also originated the movement of radiators away from the front of the car to the sides, to decrease frontal area (lowering aerodynamic drag) and centralising weight distribution. These concepts remain features of virtually all high performance racing cars today.

Chapman, working with Tony Rudd and Peter Wright, pioneered the first Formula One use of &quot;ground effect&quot;, where a low pressure was created under the car by use of the Venturi effect, generating suction (downforce) which held it securely to the road whilst cornering. Early designs utilized sliding &quot;skirts&quot; which made contact with the ground to keep the area of low pressure isolated.

Chapman next planned a car that generated all of its downforce through ground effect, eliminating the need for wings and the resulting drag that reduces a car&#x27;s speed. The culmination of his efforts, the Lotus 79, dominated the championship. However, skirts were eventually banned because they were susceptible to damage, for example from driving over a kerb, whereafter downforce would be lost and the car could then become unstable. The FIA made moves to eliminate ground effect in Formula One by raising the minimum ride height of the cars from and requiring flat bottom cars from . Car designers have managed to claw back much of that downforce through other means, aided by extensive wind tunnel testing.

One of his last major technical innovations was a dual-chassis Formula One car, the Lotus 88 in . For ground effect of that era to function most efficiently, the aerodynamic surfaces needed to be precisely located and this led to the chassis being very stiffly sprung. However, this was very punishing to the driver, resulting in driver fatigue. To get around this, Chapman introduced a car with two chassis. One chassis (where the driver would sit) was softly sprung. The other chassis (where the skirts and such were located) was stiffly sprung. Although the car passed scrutineering at a couple of races, other teams protested, and it was never allowed to race. The car was never developed further.

Chapman, whose father was a successful publican, was also a businessman and innovator in the business end of racing. He introduced major advertising sponsorship into auto racing; beginning the process which transformed Formula One from a pastime of rich gentlemen to a multi-million pound high technology enterprise. He was among the first entrants in Formula One to turn their cars into rolling billboards for non-automotive products, initially with the cigarette brands Gold Leaf and, most famously, John Player Special.

From 1978 until his death, Chapman was involved with the American tycoon John DeLorean, in his development of a stainless steel sports car to be built in a factory in Northern Ireland, which was majority-funded by the UK government. The original concept design was for a mid-engine sports car; however, difficulty in securing the original Wankel engine rights and design complications led to the rear-engine mount design. This project would eventually evolve into the DMC DeLorean.

On 19 October 1982, John DeLorean was charged with trafficking cocaine by the US Government, following a videotaped sting operation at a hotel in Los Angeles, in which he was recorded by undercover FBI agents agreeing to bankroll a cocaine smuggling operation. DeLorean Motor Cars subsequently collapsed, during which administrators discovered that £10,000,000 of British taxpayers&#x27; money (approximately equivalent to £ million in ) had gone missing.

Lotus Group&#x27;s 1981 accounts were overdue before Chapman&#x27;s death, but, when released after his death, disclosed that Lotus had been paid for engineering work by DeLorean via a Switzerland-based Panamanian company run by a DeLorean distributor, despite Chapman&#x27;s previous protestations that neither he nor the company had been paid via Panama. Chapman died before the full deceit unravelled, but, at the subsequent trial of Lotus Group accountant Fred Bushell, who had funnelled £5 million to himself in the fraud, the trial judge opined that, had Chapman himself been in the dock, he would have received a sentence &quot;of at least 10 years&quot;. The car&#x27;s engineering concept was later sold by the UK Government appointed administrators to Toyota, who used it to develop the AW11 MR2. The liquidators also recovered around £20 million from Swiss bank accounts controlled by Chapman and John DeLorean.

==Death==
The night before he died, Chapman watched a performance by his long-time friend and Lotus customer Chris Barber, the noted jazz trombonist, and his band. On 16 December 1982, Team Lotus tested the first Formula One car with active suspension, which eventually made its début with the Lotus 99T in . Chapman suffered a fatal heart attack on the same day at his home in Norwich, and died at the age of 54.

==Personal life==
Chapman was married to Hazel Chapman (1927–2021). He had two daughters and one son.

<doc id="244335" wikidata="Q321872" url="?curid=244335" title="Jay Berwanger">
<text>John Jacob &quot;Jay&quot; Berwanger (March 19, 1914 – June 26, 2002) was an American college football player and referee. In 1935, Berwanger was the first recipient of the Downtown Athletic Club Trophy, renamed the Heisman Trophy the following year. At its inception, the award was given to &quot;the most valuable player east of the Mississippi.&quot; In 1936, Berwanger became the first player drafted into the National Football League in its inaugural 1936 NFL draft, although he did not play professionally due to a salary dispute.

==College career==
After attending Dubuque High School in Iowa, Berwanger played college football for the Chicago Maroons football team of the University of Chicago for the 1933 though 1935 seasons, scoring 22 touchdowns in 24 games. He was a star halfback for Chicago, where he was known as the &quot;one man football team&quot;. Playing in the one-platoon system era, he was also a linebacker and return specialist. Berwanger was also nicknamed &quot;the Flying Dutchman&quot;, although his ancestry was actually German, and the &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, because he wore a special face guard to protect his twice-broken nose.

Berwanger was also awarded the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Silver Football as the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference and earned unanimous All-America honors. In a 1934 game against the Michigan Wolverines, Berwanger left his mark on Michigan center Gerald Ford in the form of a distinctive scar beneath the future U.S. president&#x27;s left eye. In 1935, Berwanger became the first recipient of the Downtown Athletic Club Trophy, renamed the Heisman Trophy the following year—John Heisman was then the club&#x27;s athletic director, and after Heisman&#x27;s death in October 1936 the trophy was expanded to become a national honor and named the Heisman Trophy.

Berwanger also competed in track and field for Chicago, setting a school decathlon record in 1936 that stood until 2007. He was a brother of the Psi Upsilon fraternity.

===Heisman season===
During the 1935 campaign, when he won what was to become the Heisman Trophy, Berwanger rushed for 577 yards, passed for 405, returned kickoffs for 359 yards, scored six touchdowns, and added five extra points for 41 points. His team went 4–4 with a 2–3 mark in the Big Ten that season. In voting for the award, Berwanger received 84 votes, finishing ahead of Army&#x27;s Monk Meyer, Notre Dame&#x27;s William Shakespeare, and Princeton&#x27;s Pepper Constable. He won 43% of the eligible votes cast.

==After college==
In 1936, Berwanger was the first player ever drafted into the National Football League in its inaugural 1936 NFL draft. The Philadelphia Eagles selected him, but did not think they would be able to meet his reported salary demands of $1,000 per game. They traded his negotiating rights to the Chicago Bears for tackle Art Buss.
Berwanger initially chose not to sign with the Bears in part to preserve his amateur status so that he could compete for a spot on the U.S. team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in the decathlon.

After he missed the Olympics cut, Berwanger and Bears&#x27; owner George Halas were unable to reach an agreement on salary; Berwanger was requesting $15,000 and Halas&#x27;s final offer was $13,500 . Instead, he took a job with a Chicago rubber company and also became a part-time coach at the University of Chicago. Berwanger later expressed regret that he did not accept Halas&#x27;s offer.

To continue his athletic pursuits, Berwanger started playing rugby with the Chicago team, which then won 19 straight matches and a national championship, beating the team from New York, which coincidentally had the second Heisman winner, Yale&#x27;s Larry Kelly. In 2016, Berwanger was inducted into the Rugby Hall of Fame.

==Later life and honors==
After graduating, Berwanger worked briefly as a sportswriter and later became a manufacturer of plastic car parts. He was very modest about the Heisman Trophy; unsure what to do with the trophy, he left it with his Aunt Gussie, who used it as a doorstop. The trophy was later bequeathed to the University of Chicago Athletic Hall of Fame, where it is on display. There is also a replica of the Heisman on display in the trophy case in the Nora Gymnasium at Dubuque Senior High School in Dubuque, Iowa. He is a member of both the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame and Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.

Berwanger died after a lengthy battle with lung cancer at his home in Oak Brook, Illinois, on June 26, 2002, at the age of 88.

<text>The T-1000 is a fictional character in the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, debuting as the main antagonist in the 1991 film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The character was originally portrayed by Robert Patrick, marking his breakout role.

In the franchise, the T-1000 is a Terminator, a line of android assassins created by the artificial intelligence Skynet. In the future, Skynet is engaged in a war against humans, who are led by John Connor. In &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, the T-1000 is sent back in time to kill John while he is still a child.

The T-1000 is made up of a liquid metal, known in the film as &quot;mimetic polyalloy&quot;, which allows it to shapeshift into other people or objects that come into contact with it. The liquid metal effects were created through computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and through practical effects by Stan Winston.

The character, including Patrick&#x27;s performance and the visual effects required to depict it, were praised by critics. Since then, the T-1000 has been parodied or referenced in other media. The shapeshifting abilities have also been re-used for subsequent machines in the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, including the T-X, the T-1001, and the Rev-9.

Patrick briefly reprised the role for &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, a 1996 theme park attraction. The T-1000 also briefly returns in the 2015 film &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, a reboot of the series, with Lee Byung-hun in the role.

==Abilities==
===Shapeshifting===
In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, the T-1000 is established as an advanced Terminator prototype. It is more sophisticated than the T-800, which consists of living human tissue over a metal endoskeleton. By contrast, the T-1000 is entirely made up of a liquid metal, known in the film as mimetic polyalloy, rendering it capable of shapeshifting and near-perfect mimicry of people or certain metal objects that come into contact with it. Although it possesses a default humanoid shape, it can assume alternative forms to fit through narrow openings. It can morph its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, and flatten itself and imitate the pattern and texture of the ground to hide or to ambush targets.
The T-1000 can change its surface color and texture to convincingly simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. However, its morphing abilities are limited by complexity, mass, and volume: it cannot transform into complex machines with mechanical moving parts or chemical fuels (such as guns or bombs), limiting it to stabbing weapons, and its volume prevents it from taking the form of a smaller object like a pack of cigarettes, although it is capable of impersonating larger people.

The T-1000&#x27;s abilities are further explained in the prologue of the film&#x27;s novelization; it states that the machine is a &quot;nanomorph&quot; created through nanotechnology, able to scan the molecular structure of whatever it is touching and visually mimic it. At one point in the film, the T-1000 mimics an obese security guard, which &quot;strained its ability&quot; according to the novelization.

The T-1000&#x27;s liquid metal allows the machine to recover quickly from damage, but is prone to malfunction after being frozen, as shown in the film&#x27;s &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD release. It is also susceptible to chemical damage, as shown in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;. In the latter film, it is also shown that the T-1000 can repair other Terminators by infusing them with liquid metal. It can also use its own body to form independent weapons and gadgets, such as a spear or a tracking device.

Other Terminators, including the T-X and the Rev-9, have an endoskeleton but, like the T-1000, also possess liquid metal and the shapeshifting ability. The latter features are also shared with the T-1001, which appears in the television series &quot;&quot; (2008–09).

===Others===
Besides its physical appearance, the T-1000 is also capable of accurately mimicking voices, including the ability to extrapolate a relatively small voice sample to generate a wider array of words or inflections as required. The T-1000 is able to pass as human, possessing a larger repertoire of behavioral expression and interpersonal skills than earlier Terminator models. It is apparently capable of espionage and detective skills, as it often attempts to accomplish its goals by subterfuge instead of brute force and extreme violence like the T-800. In &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, it primarily disguises itself as a police officer, allowing it to gain trust, access information, and provide a benign, friendly appearance. The T-1000 is an exceptionally fast runner. Like all Terminators, it also possesses superhuman strength, greater than that of the T-800, despite its more-slender frame and smaller stature.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991)===
In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, the T-1000 (portrayed by Robert Patrick) is sent back in time by Skynet, an artificial intelligence, to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong). In the future, Connor leads the Human Resistance in a war against Skynet and its machines. Upon arriving in the past, the T-1000 ambushes a European American officer of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and takes on his identity, tracking down John through the police cruiser&#x27;s on-board computer and eventually locating him in a shopping mall. A T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), sent by the Resistance to protect John, shows up in time to stop the T-1000. Following a brief scuffle and a lengthy truck chase, the T-800 and John escape from the T-1000.

The T-1000 visits John&#x27;s foster home and takes the place of his foster mother, Janelle Voight (Jenette Goldstein), intending to wait for him to return, but John calls ahead and the T-800 is able to confirm that the T-1000 has infiltrated the house when it incorrectly names John&#x27;s dog.

At a mental hospital, the T-800 helps John rescue his institutionalized mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), before the T-1000 can copy and terminate her. After tracking the Connors and the T-800 to Cyberdyne Systems headquarters, it gives chase and crashes a truck carrying liquid nitrogen into a steel mill. The T-1000 is frozen solid by the leaking liquid nitrogen, allowing the T-800 to shatter it with a single pistol round, although the pieces are soon thawed by the heat of the steel mill. After the T-1000 reforms, the T-800 engages it in hand-to-hand combat, buying time for Sarah and John to flee. The T-1000 shuts down the T-800 and continues the hunt for John, unaware that the T-800 has rerouted power and reactivated itself.

Having briefly made contact with Sarah earlier, the T-1000 copies her appearance and locates John, but is stopped by the real Sarah. It survives her shotgun blasts but is finally stopped as the T-800 fires its last grenade, which detonates inside the T-1000. While attempting to reform, it stumbles and falls backwards into a vat of molten steel. Unable to withstand the high temperature, it melts into nothingness, terminated.

===&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015)===
A T-1000, with a different default human appearance, is featured briefly in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, a reboot of the film series. It is revealed that Skynet sent the T-1000 to kill nine-year-old Sarah Connor (portrayed by Willa Taylor) in 1973. Although it killed her parents, she escaped and was found by a reprogrammed T-800 (Schwarzenegger), credited as &quot;Guardian&quot; and sent by an unknown party to protect her.

The same T-1000 is present in 1984, posing as an Asian American LAPD police officer (Lee Byung-hun). It intercepts Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) upon his arrival from 2029. As Kyle has no experience battling a T-1000, he is unable to defeat it and breaks into a closed department store to flee. He is arrested by two police officers, and the trio are soon attacked by the T-1000. Kyle is rescued following the arrival of Sarah (Emilia Clarke) and the Guardian (Schwarzenegger) in an armored truck. By latching a piece of itself onto the truck, the T-1000 tracks the three to the Guardian&#x27;s warehouse base. It masquerades as Reese in a failed attempt to fool Sarah, after which it launches an attack on the group, who destroy it using hydrochloric acid.

After Sarah and Reese travel to 2017, they are recognized by O&#x27;Brien, one of the police officers from 1984. His experience with the T-1000 leads him to believe their story about Skynet and free them from custody so they can stop Judgment Day. Near the film&#x27;s end, the Guardian acquires T-1000 shapeshifting abilities after being exposed to liquid metal at Cyberdyne&#x27;s headquarters.

===Other appearances===
Patrick reprised his role as the T-1000 in &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, a 1996 movie ride created for Universal Studios theme parks. In this short film, the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) takes John Connor (Furlong) to 2029 to aid him in destroying Skynet once and for all. On their way, the T-1000 chases after them while they are on a motorcycle. They lose its pursuit after the T-800 shoots at it with a shotgun several times.

Two T-1000s appear in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day – Nuclear Twilight&quot;, a 1996 comic published by Malibu Comics, in which they take on the appearance of a resistance soldier; one of them is then sent to the past to kill John Connor, as outlined in the film. In the simultaneously published &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day – Cybernetic Dawn&quot;, set just after the film, a female T-1000 and two T-800s come to the present to ensure Skynet&#x27;s creation. A T-1000, featuring the same likeness from &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, is also featured in the 2011 comic &quot;Terminator/RoboCop: Kill Human&quot;. As in the film, the T-1000 targets John but now must also confront RoboCop.

Patrick reprised the role for imagery featured in the &quot;Terminator 2&quot; arcade game (1991). The T-1000 and T-800 are also featured in the video games &quot;Call of Duty: Vanguard&quot; (2021) and the initial version of &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot; (2020) as playable operators.

==Production background==
&quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and its sequel, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), were co-written and directed by James Cameron. The antagonist in the first film is a T-800, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. An early idea for the sequel would have Schwarzenegger portraying two different T-800s from the future, one sent by Skynet to kill John Connor and the other sent by the resistance to protect him. However, co-writer William Wisher found this idea &quot;boring&quot;, and the film&#x27;s antagonist eventually became the shapeshifting T-1000. Describing his early vision of the sequel, Cameron referred to the T-1000 as an &quot;experimental, one-off super weapon&quot; that even Skynet is &quot;terrified to use.&quot;

The T-1000 primarily masquerades as a police officer, so &quot;he can go places and do things&quot; without being questioned, according to Wisher. Cameron said, &quot;That was just me having fun with an authority figure. But there is a thematic point to that, which is that we, as human beings, become terminators. We learn how to have zero compassion.&quot; Teaser trailers for &quot;Terminator 2&quot; deliberately withheld that the T-1000 was the villain and the T-800 was now the protector.
Robert Patrick was cast as the slender T-1000, a deliberate distinction from the muscular T-800. Cameron said, &quot;I wanted to find someone who would be a good contrast to Arnold. If the 800 series is a kind of human Panzer tank, then the 1000 series had to be a Porsche.&quot; He said further, &quot;I thought of it as an East meets West kind of energy, brute force versus the fluid.&quot;

Cameron&#x27;s original pick to play the T-1000 was rock musician Billy Idol, and storyboards had the android resembling him. However, a serious motorcycle accident prevented Idol from accepting the role, which required a prominent amount of running; Idol had been left with a temporary limp after the accident. He later expressed doubt that he could have topped Patrick&#x27;s &quot;incredible cold veneer&quot;. Blackie Lawless, the lead singer of W.A.S.P., had also been considered for the role but he was deemed too tall.

At the time of his casting, Patrick had been privately battling a drug and alcohol addiction, which he gave up to prepare for the physically challenging role. He worked out to get into shape and had to maintain his new physique throughout production. The films depict time travelers, including Terminators, as arriving from the future naked; the time-travel mechanics prevent clothes from going through. A commuter train went by as Patrick was filming his nude arrival scene, and he called it the most embarrassing moment of his career.

For a machine-like performance, Patrick had to learn how to fire a pistol without flinching or blinking, and run effortlessly without heavy breathing or signs of exhaustion. The T-1000&#x27;s distinctive run, developed by Patrick, shows the character with straight hands waving up and down, like blades preparing to strike a target. When not filming, Patrick primarily stayed to himself: &quot;It was kind of a method thing, in the sense that I didn&#x27;t want to be buddies with anyone. Even when I walked to set, I walked like the T-1000. I didn&#x27;t want to lose the ability to portray it, so I kept it close to me.&quot; To perfect the T-1000&#x27;s blank stare, Patrick studied predators such as eagles, cats, and sharks, and kept them in mind while filming.

Near the film&#x27;s end, the T-1000 disapprovingly wags its finger at Sarah after she tries to kill it. This was done at the spontaneous, on-set suggestion of Cameron. Patrick later recalled: &quot;I went with it, but the whole time we were shooting, I was battling with how self-aware was the T-1000? We were trying to leave no charismatic imprint on the role, other than just relentless pursuit. Portraying something without a lot of dialogue, it became all about physicality and body movement. I had to think about, &#x27;How would this thing run? How would he move?&#x27; That was the battle, and I seriously considered, &#x27;Would he wag his finger like that?&#x27;&quot;

The T-1000 became Patrick&#x27;s breakout role. As he recalled in 2017: &quot;I kept getting offers to play another robot. I just couldn&#x27;t do it, even though I didn&#x27;t have any money. Budweiser wanted to do a commercial with me as the T-1000, but I couldn&#x27;t do something like that to cheese up the legacy of &#x27;T2.&#x27;&quot; Patrick said he was &quot;damn proud&quot; of the film and his performance, and that he &quot;would love for people to always remember&quot; him as the T-1000, while adding, &quot;I would also love if people appreciated some of the other movies I did as well.&quot;

===Character&#x27;s return===

It would be years before the T-1000 returned to the film series. McG, the director of the 2009 film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, said it would be reintroduced in what was to be his concept for the next film: &quot;I like the idea and the perspective for the next picture that you meet Robert Patrick the way he looks today, and he&#x27;s a scientist that&#x27;s working on, you know, improving cell replication so we can stay healthier and we can cure diabetes and do all these things that sound like good ideas, and to once again live as idealized expressions as ourselves.&quot; He also said the origin story would satirize the world&#x27;s &quot;obsession&quot; with youth and aging. This concept, however, was scrapped when the series was rebooted with the 2015 film &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, in which the T-1000 is portrayed by Lee Byung-hun.

Patrick said in 2019 that he had mixed feelings about returning as the T-1000 for another &quot;Terminator&quot; film, noting his age and the fact that it was a physically demanding role: &quot;The whole character is the physicality, the way he moved and ran and walked, and all those things that made him iconic. Part of me says, no, that&#x27;s it, I can&#x27;t do it again. Part of me says, shit, maybe I could do it even better? I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

===Effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) had previously worked on Cameron&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;The Abyss&quot;, which had visual effects involving water, similar to the T-1000&#x27;s liquid metal ability. For &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, ILM developed computer-generated imagery (CGI) to manipulate, re-create, and &quot;morph&quot; Patrick&#x27;s image to produce the liquid metal effects. The computer graphics composed 6 of the 15 minutes that the T-1000 displays its morphing and healing abilities. The other 9 were achieved in camera with the use of advanced animatronic puppets and prosthetic effects created by Stan Winston and his team.

In &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, the effects of the T-1000 were made by British effects company Double Negative. The animation was mostly similar to how it was done in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, only with more advanced fluid simulations. To properly depict the liquid metal being dissolved by acid, Double Negative&#x27;s artists studied acid dissolving aluminum, and had its final distorted forms inspired by the 1982 film &quot;The Thing&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviewing &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote that Patrick&#x27;s T-1000 &quot;stands as one of the great monsters of the cinema.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the T-1000 a &quot;splendid villain&quot; and praised the visual effects. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The transformation effects are spectacular, in part because there&#x27;s real magic to them, a sense of technological wonder. By the end of the movie, we feel that this shape-shifting terminator, this sinister mass of chameleonic metal, has an identity all its own.&quot;

&quot;Terminator 2&quot; eventually won for Best Visual Effects at the 64th Academy Awards. Patrick was nominated for Best Villain at the 1992 MTV Movie Awards, but lost to Rebecca De Mornay for her role in &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;. Patrick was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 18th Saturn Awards, losing to William Sadler in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;.

The T-1000 was ranked #39 in the Online Film Critics Society&#x27;s 2002 list of the &quot;Top 100 Villains of All Time&quot;. Ryan Lambie, writing for &quot;Den of Geek&quot; in 2011, said of Patrick&#x27;s performance: &quot;An amorphous embodiment of death, he brings an appropriately lizard-like sense of coldness to a role with minimal dialogue. There&#x27;s something unforgettably nightmarish about the way Patrick moves in this film, whether he’s prowling around shopping malls, or both sprinting and shooting at the same time.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the T-1000 at number 19 in its recounting of the best cinematic villains, writing that Patrick&#x27;s performance &quot;left an impact that helped push &quot;Terminator 2&quot; beyond the original in terms of popularity.&quot;

Lee also received some praise for his T-1000 performance in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;. Eric Goldman of &quot;IGN&quot; called him &quot;very compelling as a new T-1000&quot;, going on to write, &quot;In fact, some of the film&#x27;s best action scenes involve the T-1000, who remains an inventive, threatening movie villain. I actually found myself wishing Lee was in more of the movie, because he, and the still-exciting T-1000 morphing abilities, brings some of the most genuine thrills to it.&quot; Julian Roman of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; found Lee&#x27;s performance memorable and called his limited screen time &quot;a total head scratcher.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Patrick&#x27;s T-1000 has been parodied or referenced in other media, outside of the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, since its original appearance.
* Patrick as the T-1000 briefly appears in the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. In a scene where Wayne is pulled over for speeding, the T-1000 — dressed in a police uniform — pulls out a picture of John Connor and asks Wayne if he has seen him, in the same manner he did in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. This results in Wayne screaming in terror and driving away.
* Patrick also briefly appears as the T-1000 in the 1993 film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, seen walking out the LAPD building as Danny and Jack Slater (played by Schwarzenegger) are entering.
* &quot;Salvage&quot;, a 2001 episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, focuses on a man made of metal. Patrick&#x27;s character, FBI agent John Doggett, expresses doubt to fellow agent Dana Scully that such a thing is possible: &quot;What are you saying? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man? &#x27;Cause that only happens in the movies, Agent Scully.&quot;
*A hint is made toward Patrick&#x27;s role as the T-1000 in the 2006 film &quot;The Marine&quot;. When gangster Bennett comments on Triton&#x27;s tenacity in chasing them with the words &quot;This guy is like the Terminator&quot;, his leader Rome (played by Patrick) fixes him with a gaze in their car&#x27;s rearview mirror.
* In the 2015 comedy &quot;Hollywood Adventures&quot;, Patrick portrays a Hollywood studio guard and parodies his T-1000 role.
* In &quot;Local News Legend&quot;, a 2015 episode of &quot;Regular Show&quot;, the recurring character of local news reporter Jackie Carmichael (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is revealed to be a T-1000 from the future, who travelled back in time to bring destruction to local news, the only blemish on the utopian future.
* In &quot;ATM&quot;, a 2023 episode of &quot;Reacher&quot;, Patrick&#x27;s character Shane Langston is discussing with his hitman employee the pseudonyms used by Reacher and Neagley: Starlin Castro and Sarah Connor. While Langston knows that Castro was the name of a former Yankees player, when the hitman asks who Sarah Connor is, Langston responds: &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit&quot;.
* The T-1000, alongside the T-800, appeared in &quot;Call of Duty: Vanguard&quot; as operators during Season Four. Archival clips from &quot;Judgement Day&quot; were utilized for the T-1000&#x27;s voice, while also allowing it to mimic the voices of other operators in the game.
* The &quot;Judgement Day&quot; version of the T-1000 appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as part of the Khaos Reigns DLC pack, voiced by Robert Patrick.

<text>Margaret Court (&quot;née&quot; Smith; born 16 July 1942), also known as Margaret Smith Court, is an Australian former world number 1 tennis player and a Christian minister. Considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time, her 24 women&#x27;s singles major titles and total of 64 major titles (including 19 major women&#x27;s doubles and 21 major mixed doubles titles) are the most in tennis history.

Court was born in Albury, New South Wales. In 1960, aged 17, she won the first of seven consecutive Australian Open singles titles. She completed the career Grand Slam in singles aged 21 with her victory at Wimbledon in 1963. Taking a brief hiatus in 1966 and 1967, Court played as an amateur until the advent of the Open Era in 1968. She completed the Grand Slam by winning all four major singles titles in 1970, part of a record six consecutive major singles victories. Court gave birth to her first child in 1972, but returned to tennis later in the year and won three major singles titles in 1973. She took similar breaks after her second and third children were born, retiring from the game in 1977.

Court is one of only three players in history (all women) to have won the &quot;Boxed Set&quot;, consisting of every major title (the singles, doubles and mixed doubles). She is the only player in tennis history to complete a double Boxed Set. Court is also one of only six tennis players to win a double career Grand Slam in two disciplines, matching Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova, Frank Sedgman, Doris Hart, and Serena Williams. She also won the Fed Cup with Australia on four occasions. The International Tennis Hall of Fame states &quot;For sheer strength of performance and accomplishment there has never been a tennis player to match (her).&quot; Evonne Goolagong called her the greatest female tennis player of all time.

Having grown up as a Roman Catholic, Court became associated with Pentecostalism in the 1970s and became a Christian minister in that tradition in 1991. She later founded Margaret Court Ministries.

==Early life==
Court was born on 16 July 1942 in Albury, New South Wales. She was the fourth and youngest child born to Maude () and Lawrence Smith. Her mother experienced a difficult delivery and came close to dying in childbirth.

Court was raised in Albury where her father worked as a foreman at a cheese and butter factory. The family lived in a &quot;very modest, two bedroom, thin-walled, asbestos dwelling with a tin roof&quot; and did not own a car during her early childhood. She played a variety of sports as a child, including basketball, cricket, softball and soccer, and had a reputation as a tomboy, joining &quot;a group of neighbourhood boys who took pleasure in climbing trees, swinging on ropes over the river, and hitching free rides on trucks as they slowed&quot;. Court received her early education at St Bridget&#x27;s, the local Catholic parochial school. She later attended St Augustine&#x27;s, a convent school across the river from Albury in Wodonga, Victoria, as well as Albury Technical College.

Court discovered tennis at the age of eight, playing on her own by hitting a tennis ball against a wall with an old fence paling. She was later given an old racquet by her mother&#x27;s friend and began sneaking in to the nearby Albury and Border Tennis Club with her friends to play on the grass courts. The club&#x27;s curator and professional coach Wally Rutter soon noticed her talent and invited her to his weekly coaching clinics. She later credited Rutter with encouraging her to pursue tennis professionally and developing her &quot;killer instinct&quot; and sense of sportsmanship.

Court moved to Melbourne at the age of 16 in order to be coached full-time by Frank Sedgman, a former world No. 1. She moved in with her older sister and worked part-time as a receptionist at Sedgman&#x27;s athletic centre. Sedgman emphasised physical fitness, developing a training regimen that included circuit running, weight-lifting and running on sandhills. He also got her to play on clay courts for the first time, with the intent that she would one day play the French Open.

==Tennis career==

As a teenager, Court won various state titles on the Australian junior circuit before winning the 1960 Australian Championships on her first attempt at the age of 17, her first major title. This would prove to be the first of seven consecutive national titles. She became the first Australian woman to win a Grand Slam tournament abroad when she won the French and US Championships in 1962. The next year, she became the first Australian woman to win Wimbledon. Across singles, doubles and mixed doubles, she has won a remarkable 64 major titles.

After the tournament in Munich, Germany in August 1966, Court temporarily retired from tennis. In 1967, she married Barry Court, whose father, Charles Court, and brother, Richard Court, were premiers of Western Australia. She returned to tennis in November 1967, and in 1970 won all four Grand Slam singles titles. The next year, she lost the Wimbledon singles final to Evonne Goolagong while pregnant with her first child, Daniel, who was born in March 1972. She made a comeback that year, playing in the US Open and throughout 1973. Her second child, Marika, was born in 1974. She started playing again in November of that year. After missing most of 1976 after having her third child, she returned to the tour in early 1977 but retired permanently that year when she learned she was expecting her fourth child. Her last Grand Slam tournament singles appearance was in the 1975 US Open. Her last Grand Slam tournament appearance overall was in the 1976 Australian Open in women&#x27;s doubles.

Court is one of only three players to achieve a career &quot;boxed set&quot; of Grand Slam tournament titles, winning every possible major title—singles, women&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles—at all four Grand Slam events. The others are Doris Hart and Martina Navratilova. However, Court is the only person to win all 12 Grand Slam events at least twice. She also is unique in having completed &quot;boxed sets&quot; both before the Open Era and after it began.

Court lost a heavily publicised and U.S.–televised challenge match to a former world No. 1 male tennis player, the 55-year-old Bobby Riggs, on 13 May 1973, in Ramona, California. Court was the top-ranked women&#x27;s player at the time, and the New York Times claimed that she did not take the match seriously because it was a mere exhibition. Using a mixture of lobs and drop shots, Riggs beat her 6–2, 6–1. Four months later, Billie Jean King beat Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes match in the Houston Astrodome.

In January 2003, Show Court One at the sports and entertainment complex Melbourne Park was renamed Margaret Court Arena. Since 2012, the arena has attracted calls for its name to be changed on the basis of Court&#x27;s statements against gay and lesbian rights.

==Playing style, Grand Slam records, and rankings==

During the 1960s, Court was considered to have a very long reach which added a new dimension to women&#x27;s volleying. With a height and reach advantage and being extremely strong, she was very formidable at the net and had an effective overhead shot. She was considered unusually mobile for her size and played an all attack, serve and volley style which, when added to her big serve, dominated conservative defensive players. Part of what helped her win was her commitment to fitness training. Court was dubbed &quot;The Aussie Amazon&quot; because she did weights, circuit training and running along sandy hillsides. This training helped keep her relatively injury-free through most of her career.

Court won a record 64 Grand Slam tournament titles, including a record 24 singles titles, 19 women&#x27;s doubles titles and a record 21 mixed doubles titles. The total includes two shared titles at the Australian Championships/Open in 1965 and 1969. The mixed doubles finals of those years were not played because of bad weather and the titles are shared by both of the finalist pairs.

Court won 62 of the 85 Grand Slam tournament finals (72.9%) she played, including 24–5 (82.8%) in singles finals, 19–14 (57.6%) in women&#x27;s doubles finals and 19–4 (82.6%) in mixed doubles finals.

Court reached the final in 29, the semifinals in 36 and the quarterfinals in 43 of the 47 Grand Slams singles tournaments she played. She won 11 of the 16 Grand Slam singles tournaments she entered, beginning with the 1969 Australian Open and ending with the 1973 US Open. She also won 11 of the 17 Grand Slam singles tournaments she entered, beginning with the 1962 Australian Championships and ending with the 1966 Australian Championships. She was 146–2 (98.6%) against unseeded players in Grand Slam singles tournaments.

Court is the only player to have won the Grand Slam in both singles and mixed doubles. She won the singles Grand Slam in 1970, the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1963 with fellow Australian Ken Fletcher and the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1965 with three different partners (Fletcher, John Newcombe and Fred Stolle).

Court won more than half of all the Grand Slam contests held in 1963 (8 of 12), 1964 (7 of 12), 1965 (9 of 12), 1969 (8 of 12), 1970 (7 of 11) and 1973 (6 of 11).

According to the end-of-year rankings compiled by London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1914 to 1972, Court was ranked world No. 1 six times: 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1970. She was also ranked No. 1 for 1973 when the official rankings were produced by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association.

== Ministry ==
Court was raised as a Roman Catholic but became involved with Pentecostalism in the mid-1970s. In 1983, she gained a theological qualification from the Rhema Bible Training Centre, and in 1991 was ordained as an independent Pentecostal minister and so speaks publicly about her faith. She subsequently founded a ministry known as Margaret Court Ministries. In 1995, she founded a Pentecostal church known as the Victory Life Centre in Perth. She still serves as its senior pastor. Her television show, &quot;A Life of Victory&quot;, airs on Sundays on the Australian Christian Channel and locally in Perth on community television station West TV. She has generally embraced teachings associated with the Word of Faith movement and teaches her view of biblical doctrine.

In 1997, Court established Victory Life Community Services, later rebranded as Margaret Court Community Outreach (MCCO). In 2014 it was described by &quot;The West Australian&quot; as &quot;one of WA&#x27;s biggest stand-alone food charities&quot;, supplying around 25 tonnes of food each week.

Since 2010, she has been the president of Victory Life International, a network of like-minded churches, and is a long-standing patron of the Australian Family Association and Drug Free Australia.

== Personal views ==
Court has been a consistent critic of same-sex marriage in Australia. In 2012, she opposed proposed same-sex marriage reforms. Court has been criticised for such statements by gay tennis players Billie Jean King, Rennae Stubbs and Martina Navratilova, and in 2012, an LGBT rights protest group called for the renaming of Margaret Court Arena.

Court was criticised in May 2017 after writing a letter to &quot;The West Australian&quot; decrying Qantas, the largest airline in Australia, for being a corporate supporter of same-sex marriage and saying that she would boycott the airline. The letter, and further follow-up interviews, again led to calls from some Australians and tennis players to rename the Margaret Court Arena. Some politicians, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, rejected calls for the change of name, saying the name celebrates Margaret Court as a tennis player. 

In June 2017, Russell Jackson wrote that Court had always held bigoted views, which he described as &quot;stubbornly immovable&quot;, citing her support for apartheid in 1970 (&quot;South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America&quot;) and her criticisms of Navratilova in 1990 (&quot;a great player but I&#x27;d like someone at the top who the younger players can look up to. It&#x27;s very sad for children to be exposed to homosexuality&quot;) as examples. He suggested that this and the similar incident from 2012 are calculated provocations, allowing Court to portray herself as the victim and use the publicity to her advantage, and show that &quot;for better or worse, Court is now the principal architect of her own image&quot;.

On 23 January 2019, Anna Wintour, in her keynote address for the Australian Open&#x27;s Inspirational Series, renewed calls for the arena&#x27;s renaming. Court responded by saying she was &quot;disappointed&quot; that someone &quot;coming from America&quot; was &quot;unable to tolerate views that were not in line with her own&quot; and &quot;[is] telling us in this nation what to do&quot;. Later in the year, Court called on Tennis Australia to honour her and the 50th anniversary of her 1970 Grand Slam in the same way as it honoured Rod Laver earlier in 2019, arguing that the organisation should disregard her views on same-sex marriage, as her tennis achievements are from &quot;a different phase of my life from where I am now and if we are not big enough as a nation and a game to face those challenges there is something wrong.&quot; Tennis Australia issued a statement that it &quot;recognises the tennis achievements of Margaret Court, although her views do not align with our values of equality, diversity and inclusion&quot; and said that it is &quot;in the process of working through&quot; how Court&#x27;s milestone might be included at the 2020 Australian Open. During the tournament, however, high-profile guests Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe paraded a banner calling for the Margaret Court Arena to be renamed in honour of four-time Australian Open champion Evonne Goolagong.

In 2020, her Margaret Court Community Outreach charity was denied a Lotterywest grant for a freezer truck on the basis of her public statements on gay people. She subsequently announced she would lodge a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission of Western Australia.

==Portrayal in film==
Jacqueline McKenzie portrayed Court in the 2001 TV movie &quot;When Billie Beat Bobby&quot;.

Jessica McNamee portrayed Court in the 2017 Hollywood film &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;.

Note: The shared mixed doubles titles at the Australian Championships/Open in 1965 and 1969 are not always counted in Court&#x27;s Grand Slam win total because the finals were never played. The Australian Open does officially count them as joint victories. Otherwise, she would have 21 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, which is reflected in the above table.

<text>The circle of Willis (also called Willis&#x27; circle, loop of Willis, cerebral arterial circle, and Willis polygon) is a circulatory anastomosis that supplies blood to the brain and surrounding structures in reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. It is named after Thomas Willis (1621–1675), an English physician.

==Structure==
The circle of Willis is a part of the cerebral circulation and is composed of the following arteries:
* Anterior cerebral artery (left and right) at their A1 segments
* Anterior communicating artery
* Internal carotid artery (left and right) at its distal tip (carotid terminus)
* Posterior cerebral artery (left and right) at their P1 segments
* Posterior communicating artery (left and right)

The middle cerebral arteries, supplying the brain, are not considered part of the circle of Willis.

===Origin of arteries===
The left and right internal carotid arteries arise from the left and right common carotid arteries.

The posterior communicating artery is given off as a branch of the internal carotid artery just before it divides into its terminal branches - the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral artery forms the anterolateral portion of the circle of Willis, while the middle cerebral artery does not contribute to the circle.

The right and left posterior cerebral arteries arise from the basilar artery, which is formed by the left and right vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries.

The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries and could be said to arise from either the left or right side.

All arteries involved give off cortical and central branches. The central branches supply the interior of the circle of Willis, more specifically, the Interpeduncular fossa. The cortical branches are named for the area they supply and do not directly affect the circle of Willis.

===Variation===

Considerable anatomic variation exists in the circle of Willis, with classic anatomy seen only in about one-third of people.
In one common variation the proximal part of the posterior cerebral artery is narrow and its ipsilateral posterior communicating artery is large, so the internal carotid artery supplies the posterior cerebrum; this is known as a fetal posterior communicating cerebral artery. In another variation the anterior communicating artery is a large vessel, such that a single internal carotid supplies both anterior cerebral arteries; this is known as an azygos anterior cerebral artery.

==Function==
The arrangement of the brain&#x27;s arteries into the circle of Willis is believed to create redundancy (analogous to engineered redundancy) for collateral circulation in the cerebral circulation. If one part of the circle becomes blocked or narrowed (stenosed) or one of the arteries supplying the circle is blocked or narrowed, blood flow from the other blood vessels can often preserve the cerebral perfusion well enough to avoid the symptoms of ischemia.

However, considering that the circle of Willis is present in many non-human species (reptiles, birds and mammals), and that arterial narrowing is mostly associated with old age and the human lifestyle, more generally applicable explanations of its functions have been suggested, such as dampening of pulse pressure waves within the brain and involvement in forebrain sensing of water loss.

==Clinical significance==
===Aneurysms===

===Subclavian steal syndrome===
The adaptive flow that the circle of Willis introduces can also lead to reduced cerebral perfusion. In subclavian steal syndrome, blood is &quot;stolen&quot; from the vertebral artery on the affected side to preserve blood flow to the upper limb. Subclavian steal syndrome results from a proximal stenosis (narrowing) of the subclavian artery, one of arteries originating off of the aortic arch. Subclavian steal syndrome has potential to affect flow in the circle of Willis.
