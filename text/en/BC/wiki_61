<text>Ivor the Engine is a British cutout animation television series created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin&#x27;s Smallfilms company. It follows the adventures of a small green steam locomotive who lives in the &quot;top left-hand corner of Wales&quot; and works for &quot;The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited&quot;. His friends include Jones the Steam, Evans the Song and Dai Station, among many other characters.

In 2024, to coincide with a reprint of the original book based on the series, Ivor and &quot;The Merioneth &amp; Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited&quot; were inducted as the 13th (and only fictional) member of the Great Little Trains of Wales. 

==Background==
Having produced the live &quot;Alexander the Mouse&quot;, and the stop motion animated &quot;The Journey of Master Ho&quot; for his employers Associated Rediffusion/ITV in partnership with Firmin, Oliver Postgate and his partner set up Smallfilms in a disused cow shed at Firmin&#x27;s home in Blean, near Canterbury, Kent.

&quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; was Smallfilms&#x27; first production, and drew inspiration from Postgate&#x27;s World War II encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railway locomotive fireman with the Royal Scot train, who described how steam engines came to life when you spent time steaming them up in the morning. Postgate decided to locate the story to North Wales, as it was more inspirational than the flat terrain of the English Midlands. The story lines drew heavily on, and were influenced by, the works of South Wales poet Dylan Thomas.

==Production==
&quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; used stop motion animation, of cardboard cut-outs painted with watercolours.

The series was originally made for black and white television by Smallfilms for Associated Rediffusion in 1958, but was later revived in 1975 when new episodes in colour were produced for the BBC.

The series was written, animated and narrated by Oliver Postgate. Peter Firmin provided the artwork. The sound effects were endearingly low-tech, with the sound of Ivor&#x27;s puffing made vocally by Postgate himself. The music was composed by Vernon Elliott and predominantly featured a solo bassoon, to reflect the three notes of Ivor&#x27;s whistle.

Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths. Anthony Jackson provided the voices for Dai Station, Evans the Song and Mr Dinwiddy.

==Episodes==
The original series was in black and white and comprised six episodes which told how Ivor wanted to sing in the choir, and how his whistle was replaced with steam organ pipes from the fairground organ on Mr Morgan&#x27;s roundabout. 
There then followed two thirteen-episode series, also in black and white. Black and white episodes were 10 minutes each.

In the 1970s, the two longer black and white series were re-made in colour, with some alterations to the stories, but they did not revisit the original six. The colour series consisted of 40 five-minute films. These would often each form part of a longer story.

Although the six original black and white episodes were subsequently released on video, the two longer black and white series (totaling 26 episodes) were not and for many years were thought to have been lost. In October 2010, however, film copies of all 26 episodes were discovered in a pig shed.

When the colour series was subsequently released on DVD, some of the episodes whose content linked, were edited together, with the relevant closing and opening titles and credits removed.

The colour series episodes were:

==Home releases==
Throughout the 1980s and the early &#x27;90s, the BBC released a few videos of &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;.

In 1984, a single 57-minute compiled video called &quot;Ivor the Engine and the Dragons&quot; with 13 stories joined up together as an omnibus.

In 1985, a single 58-minute compiled video called &quot;Ivor the Engine and the Elephants&quot; with 13 stories joined up together as an omnibus. In 1995, the video was re-released in different packaging.

In the early 1990s a video with six black and white stories of the very first &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; series in the late-1950s (previously broadcast on Associated-Rediffusion) and seven colour episodes of the 1970s BBC series of &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, all shown as single episodes, was released. The video was introduced by Oliver Postgate.

In 2000, a video called &quot;The Complete Ivor The Engine&quot; containing all 26 colour episodes was released by Universal.

In 2023, a Blu-ray called &quot;Ivor The Engine - The Colour Series&quot; containing all 40 colour, fully restored episodes was released by Fabulous Films.

== Characters ==
===Ivor===
Ivor is the steam locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited. Unlike real ones, he has a mind of his own. Ivor can drive himself and use his whistle to communicate. His fondest dream is to sing with the Grumbly and District Choral Society, a dream that is realized when his whistle is replaced with three pipes from an old fairground organ. He becomes the first bass of the choir, as well as providing them with a means of getting from place to place.

Ivor enjoys doing all sorts of things that humans do. As well as singing in the choir, he likes visiting the seaside, making tea from his boiler and spending time with his friends. He is fond of animals, and has several of them among his friends. He can be willful and disobedient at times, and it is not unknown for him to go and do his own thing when he should be working. He dislikes shunting and timetables.

Although Ivor has no technical basis, he does have technical information and a place of origin. As stated in series 2 episode 14 &quot;Smoke hill&quot; it is quoted that Ivor is &quot;Just an ordinary small Box tank, 3 Cylinder Straight linked, 0-4-0 engine By Huntington &amp; pottage of Crew.&quot;

===Jones the Steam===
Edwin Jones is Ivor&#x27;s driver. He is a cheerful and kind-hearted man who perhaps sympathizes more than most railway staff with Ivor&#x27;s idiosyncrasies. Postgate and Firmin describe him as &quot;an ordinary engine driver who is there to cope with whatever needs to be coped with&quot;. People who are new to the area find him rather eccentric for talking to his engine.

When not driving Ivor or helping the engine with his latest flight of fancy, he enjoys fishing and day-dreaming.

===Dai Station===
The station master at Llaniog. He is a stickler for the regulations of the railway, but bends the rules occasionally to help his friends. His life is made a little difficult by the fact that Ivor really doesn&#x27;t care much for regulations at all. Although he is often gloomy and overly strict, he is a good person at heart.

===Owen the Signal===
Owen the Signal inhabits a signal box near Ivor&#x27;s shed and makes an occasional appearance in the episodes.

===Evans the Song===
Evan Evans is the portly choirmaster of the &quot;Grumbly and District Choral Society&quot;. He is also Jones the Steam&#x27;s wife&#x27;s uncle.

===Mrs Porty===
A rich and eccentric aristocratic lady who enjoys the occasional glass of port and has new hats sent from London every week. She is also technically the owner of the railway, having bought it when the line was threatened with nationalisation. However, she does not bother much with the day-to-day running and things remained much the same after she bought it.

===Mr Dinwiddy===
A very odd, possibly insane miner who lives in the hills and digs for gold. He enjoys explosions and mining. In fact, his mountain is full of gold, but as soon as he digs it up, he puts it back again. He often has need of new boots.

He is something of an amateur scientist. He describes himself as &quot;educated&quot; and knows &quot;something about rock&quot;. He has constructed a few odd devices, including a donkey carriage and a bubble-blowing machine.

===Bani Moukerjee===
An elephant keeper from India, who works for Charlie Banger&#x27;s Circus. He is in charge of the elephants Alice, George, Margaret and Clarence, who all obey him without question.

===Charlie Banger===
The eponymous and larger-than-life owner of Charlie Banger&#x27;s Circus, who arranges a free show for the town in order to thank Jones, Evans and Mr Hughes for their help in looking after Alice the Elephant following her injury.

===Idris the Dragon===
A small, red Welsh dragon who also sings in the choir for a time. Having been hatched from an egg in Ivor&#x27;s fire, he lives with his wife Olwen and their twins, Daian and Blodwen, in the extinct volcano &quot;Smoke Hill&quot;. As well as singing, he proves useful by cooking fish and chips for the choir using his fiery breath.

On the other hand, Idris runs into trouble when Smoke Hill goes cold and needs to be kept hot in order to survive. The gasboard provide a temporary furnace, but when that became too expensive (and decimalisation renders the slot-machine inoperable), the only other option for the dragons is a heated cage. Luckily, Mr Dinwiddy is able to provide a solution, and they now live in a geothermally-heated cave under the ground.

===Alice the Elephant===
A circus elephant with Charlie Banger&#x27;s Circus. She is normally placid, but does not like taking medicine or being bathed by anyone except her owner, Bani Moukerjee. When Ivor met her, she had escaped and was asleep on the track with an injured foot. Since then they have become friends. She and her elephant friends were able to help Ivor when he got stuck in the snow.

===Bluebell the Donkey===
A donkey who lives at Mrs Porty&#x27;s house. She cannot talk, but she and Ivor just enjoy sitting around together. As the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited has only one locomotive (apart from the short service of &quot;Juggernaut&quot;), Bluebell is sometimes called upon to provide motive power. Examples include the towing by chain of the broken down locomotive &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and also the pulling of Mrs Porty&#x27;s donkey cart when this was temporarily set on the railway tracks to pursue &#x27;robbers&#x27; when Ivor had been &#x27;stolen&#x27; in the episode &quot;The Lost Engine&quot;; in this latter case, like a locomotive, Bluebell strictly observed the railway signals, halting the chase until Owen the Signal had raised the signal arm.

===Morgan the Roundabout===
Mr Morgan is the fairground owner. He gave Ivor some pipes from the steam organ on his roundabout, so that Ivor could sing in the choir. He only appeared in the very first black and white series.

===Claude Gilbert===
Claude Gilbert was the station master of Tan-y-Gylch station in the original black-and-white series, and would share a cup of tea with Jones whilst Ivor rested at the platform. It was he who directed Jones and Dai to Mr Jenkins the Builder when they were searching for organ pipes to replace Ivor&#x27;s whistle. Like Mr Morgan, he only appeared in the first black and white series and was not seen again.

===Mr Hughes The Gasworks===
The gruff but kind-hearted proprietor of the local gasworks, he is well known for keeping pets, in particular budgerigars. He is asked to provide shelter for Alice the Elephant when she has an injured foot, and, despite his initial reluctance, he more than rises to the occasion.

===Miss Ludgrove===
The local vet, with a dry sense of humour, who comes to examine Alice&#x27;s injured foot.

===Mr Brangwyn===
A robust and larger-than-life pigeon-fancier, who occupies a house by the railway, and is engaged to Miss Price from Llangubbin. It is Mr Brangwyn who provides the elephant&#x27;s boot for Alice: he obtained said boot during the time he once spent in India.

===Mrs Williams===
The local postmistress, who is a bit batty and a bit of a gossip. She occasionally interacts with Jones and Ivor.

===Eli The Baker===
The feisty but big-hearted and hard-working local baker.

===Mrs Thomas===
The local fish-and-chip shop owner. A plump woman with a big voice, she is kind and cheerful and serves the choir with food after their sessions.

===Policeman Gregory===
Mainly known as P.C. Gregory. The local and only village policeman. One of his most notable happenings is after Ivor went to keep the chickens warm on his boiler. Jones and Dai find 3 small eggs in Ivor&#x27;s coal bunker, and after a small &quot;finders-keepers&quot; argument they are interrupted by P.C. Gregory, who then removes his helmet (which was padded on the inside) and takes the eggs. After he leaves Dai asks if the farmer will ever see those 3 eggs again, as P.C. Gregory likes a good egg in the morning.

===Professor Longfellow===
This seemingly batty professor was only seen in a few episodes. He was famously known for ordering a telescope cover; however, as it was one of Ivor&#x27;s deliveries, Mrs Porty believes it is her newest hat, and wears it to a meeting later in the episode. He was also notable for telling Jones, Idris, and Dai, that the closest active volcano to the now extinct &quot;Smoke Hill&quot; is in southern Italy.

===Mr Mervin===
The local bank manager. He only appears in a few episodes; his most notable appearance is his and Jones&#x27;s adventure to find more half-crowns for the gas meter powering &quot;Smoke-Hill&quot;.
As this episode takes place when decimalisation occurs, Jones must inform Idris and Co. that there are no more half-crowns in Wales and that &quot;you have had the lot&quot;. They go and find in a small shop, an old tin teapot full to the brim with half-crowns. &quot;Smoke-Hill&quot; is gas fired for the final time until the dragons go to Mr Dinwiddy and his geothermal heated cave.

===Mrs Griffiths===
Mrs Griffiths is a member of the Welsh Antiquarian Society and a passionate believer in Dragons. She first came to seeking Jones the Steam in hopes of finding Idris the dragon, after hearing that dragons had been sighted in Llannyog. Idris had already run away by this point after learning that people were looking for him so Jones misled Mrs Griffiths into giving up the search by pretending to be an insane person who spoke to railway engines (Ivor enhanced Jones&#x27; performance by not blowing his own whistle).

When Idris&#x27; home Smoke Hill lost its heat, Jones and Ivor took Idris to see Mrs Griffiths in her shop in Llanmadd. After seeing Idris and his brethren, and Ivor&#x27;s self-whistling, Mrs Griffiths apologises to Jones for thinking him mad and agrees to help the dragons. Mrs Griffiths and her fellows at the Antiquarian Society hire Mr Hughes the Gasworks to fit out Smoke Hill with gas heating and in the series one finale Smoke Hill, now a gas-fired volcano, is reignited and all the characters sing in gladness. However, the gas-heating includes a gas meter that only takes half-crowns, which are no longer &quot;legal tender&quot;. On a few occasions, the gas meter runs out and Jones and Ivor have to search high and low for more half crowns.

Eventually, they use up all the half crowns in their part of Wales so they return to Mrs Griffiths for help, but Jones leaves Ivor alone in a siding while he speaks to Mrs Griffiths and two of the dragons, who were in Ivor&#x27;s firebox, decide to fly about the town. They come across a statue of St. George famously slaying a dragon. The dragons, being quite young and naïve, attack St George&#x27;s statue with jets of fire in the hope of saving the dragon. When Mrs Griffiths and Jones the Steam arrive, she - being horrified by the sight of two dragons attacking the statue - accuses them of vandalism and tells Jones to take them away.

===Juggernaut===
The Juggernaut is a diesel rail lorry made out of bits, bobs and flanged wheels, which appears towards the end of the series. Due to its inadequate brakes, it runs down a hill and falls into the lake soon after starting service, nearly killing Idris, whom it was carrying on a chestnut barrow.

==Books==
&quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; was published by Abelard Schuman in 1962.

Six story books, based upon the TV series were published in the 1970s and reprinted in 2006/07:

* &quot;Ivor the Engine: Ivor&#x27;s Birthday&quot;
* &quot;The Ivor the Engine Annual&quot; circa 1978.

The London Borough of Hackney Public Libraries banned the entire series because of the Indian elephant keeper, called Bani because &quot;they thought ethnic minorities might be offended by him.

==Influences and future appearances==

* Postgate and Firmin created a map of their fictional railway which was adhered to rigidly during filming.
* The Who include a character named &#x27;Ivor The Engine Driver&#x27; in their song &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;, which appears on their 1966 album &#x27;A Quick One&#x27;.

<doc id="249372" wikidata="Q733234" url="?curid=249372" title="Efteling">
<text>Efteling () is a fantasy-themed amusement park in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands. The attractions reflect elements from ancient myths and legends, fairy tales, fables, and folklore.

The park was opened on May 31, 1952. It evolved from a nature park with a playground and a &quot;Fairytale Forest&quot; into a full-sized theme park. It now caters to both children and adults with its cultural, romantic, and nostalgic themes, in addition to its wide array of amusement rides including six roller coasters and four dark rides.

It is the largest theme park in the Netherlands and one of the oldest theme parks in the world. It is twice as large as the original Disneyland park in the United States and predates it by three years. Annually, the park has more than 5 million visitors. In 2020, due to differences in pandemic policy, it was the most visited theme park in Europe, ahead of Disneyland Park. In 2019 and 2022, it was the third most visited theme park in Europe, after Disneyland Park, Paris and Europa-Park, Germany.

== History ==
Efteling is one of the oldest theme parks still in existence. Its roots go when the R. K. Sport en Wandelpark was inaugurated.

In 1950, Efteling Nature Park Foundation (Stichting Natuurpark de Efteling) was founded by the mayor of Loon op Zand, R.J. van der Heijden, filmmaker Peter Reijnders, and designer artist Anton Pieck (1895-1987). The foundation was named after a 16th-century farm named Ersteling. Efteling officially opened on May 31, 1952, when the Fairy Tale Forest (&quot;het Sprookjesbos&quot;), designed by the famous Dutch illustrator Anton Pieck, was opened to the public. Initially, the Fairy Tale Forest was home to some 10 different fairy tales, all of them brought to life using original drawings by Pieck alongside mechanics, lighting and sound effects designed by the Dutch filmmaker Peter Reijnders. The life-sized dioramas, displayed together in an atmospheric forest, were a tremendous success. Efteling welcomed 240,000 visitors in 1952 alone.

Since 1978, the park has been expanded and grown to become one of the most popular theme parks in the world. In the same year, English singer Kate Bush performed in the park in &quot;De Efteling Special&quot;, which was broadcast on 11 May 1978. In early 1978, the amusement park&#x27;s Haunted Castle was completed and the opening was scheduled on 10 May that year. Bush, who just had a big hit in the Netherlands with &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, made her debut on Dutch television in the special. Her popularity was used to draw the attention to the Haunted Castle.

In 2010, Efteling announced plans to remain open year-round. From November through about February, the &#x27;Winter Efteling&#x27; theme remains in place. However, attractions that involve water, such as the rapids ride &#x27;Piraña&#x27; or the water coaster &#x27;Vliegende Hollander&#x27; (Flying Dutchman), are closed.

Gisela Williams, a reporter for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, wrote a review of the park in early 2014. Williams praised Efteling but criticized the teacups-style ride Monsieur Cannibale due to ethnic stereotypes. Her review was later mentioned in &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;, a daily newspaper in the Netherlands, and drew several angry comments from its readership. Williams also received her first death threat for her comments about the controversial attraction. In recent years, activists have repeatedly requested the Efteling to remove or re-theme the attraction. In June 2021, the park closed the ride for an extensive renovation including a re-theme.

The park received its 123,456,789th guest on June 19, 2015. The Efteling opened the trackless darkride Symbolica in 2017. With a price tag of 35 million euros, it is the most expensive investment in Efteling history. Beside the theme park, the Efteling operates two hotels, a theatre, and two holiday villages. The Efteling inaugurated its 30th fairytale in 2019.

In December 2020, the park was forced to close in compliance with the new COVID-19 restrictions introduced by prime minister Mark Rutte and the third Rutte cabinet.

== Design ==


The success of Efteling has been attributed largely to its ride designs, architecture and atmosphere. When Anton Pieck was asked to design the initial fairy tales for the Efteling, he made sure the park would live up to his personal high standards. There would be no use of cheap building materials, plastic, or concrete. Pieck&#x27;s illustration style, somewhat grim and dark, but also romantic and nostalgic, was the thematic base on which nearly all future expansions were built.

Pieck worked for Efteling until the mid-1970s, when his position as chief designer was passed on to the younger Ton van de Ven. Van de Ven had already been working for Efteling for several years and Pieck was very pleased with his work. The Haunted Castle (&quot;het Spookslot&quot;), which opened in 1978 as the park&#x27;s first new large attraction, was Efteling&#x27;s first to be designed entirely by Van de Ven.

Van de Ven continued his work until 2002, when he retired. A new team of imagineers works on new Efteling attractions, still in a style suitable to the Efteling.

== Divisions ==
The Efteling Theme Park Resort now comprises several divisions: the theme park (1952), the four-star Efteling Hotel (1992), the 18-hole golf course (1995), Efteling Theatre (2002), accommodation parks: Efteling Bosrijk (2009) &amp; Het Loonsche Land (2017). The theatre, which was once used for park shows, is one of the five biggest theatres in the Netherlands and can house big theatre productions, which will not be included in park admissions.

Besides using it as a home base for shows/musicals created by the Efteling itself (like &quot;Droomvlucht&quot;) it also lends itself out for other big productions, events, and business events. The hotel was operated by Golden Tulip for several years, but Efteling decided in 2004 to manage it independently. All divisions are now profitable, although it took the golf course several years to break even. The divisions are each contained in commercial corporations, but all shares are still held by the nonprofit Efteling Nature Park Foundation (&quot;Stichting Natuurpark de Efteling&quot;).

== The park ==


The theme park covers . This area has changed only marginally over the course of its history. The Efteling Theme Park Resort also offers the Efteling hotel, the Efteling hotel Loonsche Land, a theatre, a golf course, Villa Pardoes, and two holiday villages (Efteling Bosrijk and Efteling Loonsche Land) on . The park&#x27;s foundation owns a total of also including young forest, nature reserve, some grassland, fields and roads.

The park is divided into five themed areas or &#x27;realms&#x27;. Originally, the park was divided into four areas called North, West, East, and South, with most of the park&#x27;s historical rides and attractions, such as the Fairy Tale Forest, located in West. When the park reorganized its infrastructure in the late 1990s, adding the Pardoes Promenade (named after Efteling&#x27;s mascot &quot;Pardoes&quot;, a court jester) and a central hub called Efteling Brink, it also changed the areas&#x27; names. North was changed to &quot;Reizenrijk&quot; (Travel Realm), West became &quot;Marerijk&quot; (Fairy Realm), East became &quot;Ruigrijk&quot; (Adventure Realm), and South became &quot;Anderrijk&quot; (Other Realm). In 2017 a fifth realm opened in the center of the park called &quot;Fantasierijk&quot; (Fantasy Realm).

Although the park was not built with these divisions in mind and the names may seem cryptic, they do make sense. Perhaps the area most suited to its name is &quot;Ruigrijk&quot;, where most fast rides such as the double-loop roller coaster Python (constructed in 1981) are located. &quot;Marerijk&quot; is the home to the Fairy Tale Forest and the Fairies of the &quot;Droomvlucht&quot;, &quot;Anderrijk&quot; has some rides that are inspired by non-Western cultures (e.g. Fata Morgana and Piraña), while &quot;Reizenrijk&quot; has the Carnaval Festival ride, which travels through several different &#x27;countries&#x27;. The &quot;Fantasierijk&quot; got its name from the darkride &quot;Symbolica: Palace of Fantasy&quot;.

Efteling was largely built in an existing pine forest located in a rural area, giving it a &#x27;nature park&#x27; feeling. Together with its large ponds and gardens, its abundant green space is rather unusual among the world&#x27;s leading theme parks.

== Efteling Grand Hotel ==

The Efteling Grand Hotel is an upcoming hotel located in the Efteling theme park in the Netherlands. Scheduled to open in the summer of 2025, it will be the largest hotel within the park and will provide direct access to its attractions.

The hotel will feature 140 rooms and suites, each designed with a unique color theme and incorporating subtle references to Efteling’s fairytale aesthetic. It will consist of seven floors and include various amenities such as restaurants, a boutique, and wellness facilities.

Each room is designed in a single-color theme with decorative elements inspired by Efteling. A total of 644 beds will be available, with an emphasis on comfort through high-quality pillows and duvets.
The hotel will include a spacious lobby, shopping facilities, and dining options.

The hotel will offer multiple dining options, including Brasserie 7, a casual dining venue featuring a variety of dishes, with a conservatory overlooking the Aquanura water show. For a more refined experience, Restaurant &amp; Bar Mystique will provide an extended dining experience with a selection of cocktails and bar snacks.

In addition to dining, guests will have access to wellness and recreational facilities. The Pool &amp; Spa area will feature a swimming pool designed around a spring theme, as well as a wellness area with a sauna, steam bath, and massage services.

The Efteling Grand Hotel is expected to open in the summer of 2025. It is centrally located within Efteling, allowing guests easy access to the theme park’s attractions.

== Economy and governance ==


=== Structure ===
The Efteling is a private company limited by shares. The Efteling Nature Park Foundation (&quot;Stichting Natuurpark de Efteling&quot;) is the only shareholder. The foundation was founded in 1950 by R.J.Th. van der Heijden, Peter Reijnders, and Anton Pieck. The company is led by two directors. They manage four sections: the theme park, the Efteling Hotel, the Efteling Golf course, and the Efteling Theatre.

Since April 17, 2014, the company&#x27;s CEO has been Fons Jurgens.

=== Employees ===
In the high season, Efteling employs 2,500 workers. In 2000, the number was 1670, of which 400 had a permanent contract (24%), 450 were seasonal employees (27%) and 820 had temp jobs (49%).

=== Visitors ===
: Disneyland Paris, #2 amusement park in Europe of annual attendance, in 2020
: Efteling, #1 amusement park in Europe of annual attendance, in 2020

Efteling welcomed 3,240,000 visitors in 2007, making it the most popular theme park in the Netherlands. In 2009, the park&#x27;s attendance surpassed for the first time since its opening 4,000,000 visitors and in 2017 roughly 5,180,000 visitors went to the park, making it the most popular tourist daytrip destination in all categories. The objective was to reach 5 million admissions in 2020. It is reached in 2017, three years earlier than expected.

In its opening year (1952), the park had 222,941 visitors. In 1954, the millionth visitor since the official opening was welcomed.

In 1983, the attendance increases by 30%. Efteling is the leading leisure park in Europe with 1.9 million visitors per year. In 1989, Efteling leads European parks in terms of attendance, 2.1 million people go to the park, including 1.6 million from the Netherlands. In 1991, Efteling is on the top step of the European podium with 2.6 million visitors. On the second step, three parks have 2 million admissions: Europa-Park, Alton Towers and Phantasialand. On the third step, two parks show 1.4 million admissions: Walibi Wavre and Parc Astérix.

Most of the visitors are Dutch; 94% of the Dutch population has visited the park. About 16% of visitors live in areas such as Flanders (Belgium), Westphalia (Germany) and Southern England (UK).

=== Ticket price ===
A graph of the ticket price in euros of the Efteling during the period 1952-2014:

From 1952 to 2002, the ticket price was set in Dutch guilders. These prices were converted to euros using a conversion factor of 0.45378. In 1952, the ticket price was 0.80 Dutch guilders (0.36 euro). From 1956 to 1965, the ticket price was 1 Dutch guilder. The price had risen to 42 Dutch guilders by 2001 and was converted to 21 euros in 2002, during the switch to the euro in the Netherlands. tickets cost 42.00 euros or 40.00 euros by &quot;low season&quot;. There are also tickets for 68.00 euros that include lunch, dinner and free parking among other things. Tickets ordered online are sold with a discount of 2 euros. Admission is free for children under 4.

=== Investments ===
On December 11, 2008, theme park officials announced that they would spend EUR40 million during 2009–2012 on three large construction projects: a convention centre accommodating 1500 visitors (de Burcht), an arena from the Middle Ages for 750 show spectators (Raveleijn), and a redesign for snack bar &quot;De Likkebaerd&quot; to turn it into a station for the park&#x27;s steam train. They also said they did not expect to suffer from the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. In 2009, the Efteling announced that the Burcht has been cancelled.

The park announced in 2015 that they had the ambition to welcome 7 million guests by 2030. For this they drew up a zoning plan in the period from 2015 to 2018 called &#x27;Bestemmingsplan Wereld van de Efteling 2030&#x27;. The park will at first expand to the east as far as the road De Horst and the highway N261. After the eastern expansion, the park will expand in a western direction on the site where parking spaces are currently located. In 2018, the zoning plan was unanimously adopted within the municipality of Loon op Zand, after which three objections were submitted to the Raad van State. Two objections were investigated by the council and in the meantime the council decided that De Efteling was not allowed to start implementing the plan. With an adjustment on a number of points, the council approved the zoning plan in June 2021. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the multiple closures of the park, the park had to review its investments. It decided to postpone the expansion towards the east side for a few years and to focus on expansions within the existing park boundaries. On January 24, 2022, the company announced that it would invest €75 million in the construction of a new hotel within the park on the square behind the entrance and in an attraction that will replace Spookslot.

<text>Howard Johnson by Wyndham, still commonly referred to as Howard Johnson&#x27;s, is an American hotel brand with over 200 hotels in 15 countries. It was also formerly a restaurant chain, which at one time was the largest in the U.S., with more than 1,000 locations. Since 2006, all hotels and company trademarks, including those of the defunct restaurant chain, have been owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts.

Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants originally started as a single location opened by Howard Deering Johnson in 1925 and grew into a substantial restaurant chain in the decades that followed. By the 1950s, the company expanded operations by opening hotels, then known as Howard Johnson&#x27;s Motor Lodges, which were often located next to restaurants. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it had become the largest restaurant chain in the U.S., with its combined company-owned and franchised outlets. 

Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants were franchised separately from the hotel brand beginning in 1986 but, in the years that followed, severely dwindled in number until eventually disappearing altogether. The last restaurant, in Lake George, New York, closed in 2022. The line of branded supermarket frozen foods, as well as its famous ice cream, is no longer manufactured.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1925, Howard Deering Johnson borrowed $2,000 to buy and operate a small corner pharmacy in Wollaston, a neighborhood in Quincy, Massachusetts. Johnson was surprised to find it easy to pay back the money lent to him after discovering his recently installed soda fountain had become the busiest part of his drugstore. Eager to ensure that his store would remain successful, Johnson decided to devise a new ice cream recipe. Some sources say the recipe was based on his mother&#x27;s homemade ice creams and desserts, while others say that it was from a local German immigrant, who either sold or gave Johnson the ice cream recipe. The new recipe made the ice cream more flavorful due to increased butterfat content. Eventually, Johnson created 28 flavors of ice cream. He is quoted as saying, &quot;I thought I had every flavor in the world. That &#x27;28&#x27; (flavors of ice cream) became my trademark.&quot;

Throughout the summers of the late 1920s, Johnson opened concession stands on the beachfront property along the coast of Massachusetts. The stands sold soft drinks, hot dogs, and ice cream. Each stand was successful. With his success becoming more noticeable every year, Johnson convinced local bankers to lend him funds to operate a family-style restaurant. Negotiations were made and, toward the end of the decade, the first Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant opened in Quincy. It featured fried clams, baked beans, chicken pot pies, frankfurters, ice cream, and soft drinks.

The first Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant received a tremendous boost in 1929, owing to an unusual set of circumstances: Malcolm Nichols, the mayor of nearby Boston, banned the production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play, &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; in Boston. Rather than fight the mayor, the Theatre Guild moved the production to the Wollaston Theatre in Quincy. The five-hour play was presented in two parts with a dinner break. The first Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant was near the theater, and hundreds of influential Bostonians flocked to the restaurant. Through word of mouth, more Americans became familiar with the Howard Johnson Company.

===Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s===


Johnson wanted to expand his company, but the stock market crash of 1929 prevented this. After waiting a few years and maintaining his business, Johnson persuaded an acquaintance in 1935 to open a second Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant in Orleans, Massachusetts. The second restaurant was franchised and not company-owned. This was one of America&#x27;s first franchising agreements.

By the end of 1936, there were 39 more franchised restaurants, creating a total of 41 Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants. By 1939, there were 107 Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants along American East Coast highways, generating revenues of $10.5 million. In less than 14 years, Johnson directed a franchise network of over 10,000 employees with 170 restaurants, many serving 1.5 million people a year.

Johnson’s success gave him the added opportunity to capitalize on getting his name around. When wealthy socialite Dorothy May Kinnicutt Parish (known as Sister Parish) began her decorating business in the 1930s, Johnson hired her to decorate the restaurant he built in Somerville, New Jersey. She told a reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, “I dressed the waitresses in aqua, did the walls in aqua, I made the placemats in aqua. I guess I must have thought it was quite chic, but I haven’t done a thing in aqua since.” (quoted in &quot;A History of Howard Johnson’s&quot; by Anthony Mitchell Sammarco).

The unique icons of orange roofs, cupolas, and weather vanes on Howard Johnson properties helped patrons identify the chain&#x27;s restaurants and motels. The restaurant&#x27;s trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman logo was created by artist John Alcott in the 1930s while the fiberglass signs were sculptured by Charles Pizzano.

There were 200 Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants when America entered World War II.

By 1944, only 12 Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants remained in business. The effects of war rationing crippled the company. Johnson managed to maintain his business by serving commissary food to war workers and U.S. Army recruits. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike (1940), and later the Ohio Turnpike, New Jersey Turnpike and Connecticut Turnpike were built, Johnson bid for and won exclusive rights to serve drivers at service station turnoffs through the turnpike systems.

In the process of recovering from these losses, in 1947 the Howard Johnson Company began construction of 200 new restaurants throughout the American Southeast and Midwest. By 1951, the sales of the Howard Johnson Company totaled $115 million.

=== Entering the hotel business ===

By 1954, there were 400 Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants in 32 states, about 10% of which were extremely profitable company-owned turnpike restaurants; the rest were franchises. This was one of the first nationwide restaurant chains.

While many places sold &quot;fried clams&quot;, they were whole, which was not universally accepted by the American dining public. Howard Johnson popularized Soffron Brothers Clam Company&#x27;s fried clam strips, the &quot;foot&quot; of hard-shelled sea clams. They became popular to eat in this fashion throughout the country.

In 1954, the company opened the first Howard Johnson&#x27;s motor lodge in Savannah, Georgia. The company employed architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch to oversee the design of the rooms and gate lodge. Nims had previously worked with the company, designing restaurants. The restaurant&#x27;s trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman was now joined by a lamplighter character in the firm&#x27;s marketing of its motels. According to cultural historians, the chain became synonymous with travel among American motorists and vacationers in part because of Johnson&#x27;s ubiquitous outdoor advertising displays.

In 1959, Howard Deering Johnson, who had founded and managed the company since 1925, turned control over to his son, then 26-year-old Howard Brennan Johnson. The elder Johnson observed his son&#x27;s running of the company until his death in 1972 at the age of 75.

Howard Johnson Company went public in 1961; there were 605 restaurants, 265 company-owned and 340 franchised, as well as 88 franchised Howard Johnson&#x27;s motor lodges in 32 states and The Bahamas.

In 1961, Johnson hired New York chefs Pierre Franey and Jacques Pépin to oversee food development at the company&#x27;s main commissary in Brockton, Massachusetts. Franey and Pépin developed recipes for the company&#x27;s signature dishes that could be flash frozen and delivered across the country, guaranteeing a consistent product.

=== Civil rights ===
While the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1954 struck down segregation in public schools, the segregation, and maintenance of whites-only public facilities continued in other domains, including the Howard Johnson chain. Segregation in Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants provoked an international crisis in 1957, when a Howard Johnson eatery in Dover, Delaware, refused service to Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of Ghana, prompting a public apology from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, was instrumental in organizing protests and sit-ins at Howard Johnson locations in multiple states.

The city of Durham, North Carolina, became notable as a focus for action against segregated restaurants and hotels, including Howard Johnson&#x27;s. On 12 August 1962, attorney and civil rights activist Floyd McKissick initiated the first of multiple rallies and demonstrations against segregated establishments in Durham, including the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant on Chapel Hill Boulevard, culminating in multiple protests on 18–20 May 1963 resulting in mass arrests as well as an eventual rapprochement with the city government. Future senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, while a student at the University of Chicago in 1962, helped organize picketing of a Howard Johnson&#x27;s location in Cicero, Illinois, during his time as a student activist for CORE.

By 7 December 1962, the Howard Johnson Company issued a statement to the press opposing racial segregation in its restaurants, citing its corporate policy against discrimination: &quot;Where it has been possible to change the operation of our company-operated restaurants in the South to conform to our national policy of service without discrimination, this has been done.&quot; The letter, written in conjunction with CORE and the NAACP, praised the organizations and aligned company policy with their outlook that segregation was &quot;not defensible.&quot;

Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants by the 1960s were known to be accommodating to members of the LGBTQ community, particularly in metropolitan New York. On April 21, 1966, at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s in the Greenwich Village neighborhood, Dick Leitsch, Craig Rodwell, and John Timmins, all members of the New York chapter of the Mattachine Society, an early American gay rights group, patronized the restaurant as part of a &#x27;Sip-In&#x27; demonstration in protest of New York liquor laws that prevented serving gay customers. The men were served drinks without incident at the restaurant; they later visited Julius&#x27; Bar where they were denied service, eventually leading to changes in the laws. In the late 1960s, gay liberation activist and self-identified drag queen Marsha P. Johnson decided on the drag queen name &quot;Marsha P. Johnson&quot;, getting Johnson from the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant on 42nd Street.

=== New chains and a changing public ===
In the 1930s, H.D. Johnson bought the Wayland Red Coach Grill and used it as the model for a new concept, a more upscale steakhouse restaurant chain called Red Coach Grills.
While they had some success, they were not sufficiently profitable. Eventually, the last 15 Red Coach Grills were sold in 1983 to a company executive who closed them.
In 1969, Johnson again tried a new restaurant concept, Ground Round. It was successful. Although not a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant, the Ground Round chain was company-owned and franchised, thus increasing the Howard Johnson Company profit.

The 28 flavors of ice cream and piggybank-sensitive meal prices made it possible to lure families. The company also started some child-friendly promotions. One was a birthday club. Children signed up in advance and were sent birthday cards redeemable for a free meal, a cake, and in some locations, balloons and lollipops. Family members’ meals were charged at normal rates. The Springfield, New Jersey, restaurant sent out 10,000 cards one year, and they had a 50 percent return on those who came to take advantage of the birthday offer.

Children’s menus were an attractive staple of Howard Johnson’s. In addition to offering kid-friendly food at lower prices, industrial designer John Alcott’s firm created a variety of menus that kept the kids entertained. Some were maps of the United States, one was a guide to the metric system. Another menu could be converted to a mask if string was added at home.

Howard Johnson’s also held contests. If a person submitted proof via a check-off coupon that they had sampled all 28 flavors of ice cream, the next ice cream cone was free.

By 1975, the Howard Johnson Company had more than 1,000 restaurants and more than 500 motor lodges in 42 states and Canada. The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Howard Johnson Company. Because of the oil embargo of 1973, the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants and motor lodges, which received 85% of revenue from travelers, lost profits when Americans could not afford long trips or frequent vacations. Rather than promoting the restaurants to travelers, management knew it had to focus on nearby population centers. 

Also, the company model of serving pre-made food with high-quality ingredients in traditional dining rooms was costly when compared to the innovations introduced by fast food outlets like McDonald&#x27;s, which designed its products and restaurants to appeal to families with younger children. Around this time, the chain introduced &quot;Hojo Cola&quot; and other private-label sodas, which disappointed some customers who preferred familiar products such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi.

The company suffered from two infamous incidents at a property in the New Orleans Central Business District within 18 months of one another. The first was a July 1971 fire, set by two irate guests who had been ejected from the hotel, which killed six people. The second, in January 1973, was a harrowing day-long siege. Former Black Panther Mark Essex used the hotel&#x27;s roof as a sniper&#x27;s perch, killing three police officers, including Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo, the second-highest ranking officer in the New Orleans Police Department, the hotel&#x27;s general manager and assistant general manager, and a couple from Virginia, who were on a belated honeymoon. He also wounded policemen, firemen and citizens. 

Then, in Jericho, New York, on 8 November 1974, singer-actress Connie Francis was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson&#x27;s Lodge and nearly suffocated when the rapist threw a heavy mattress on her. She sued the motel chain for their lapse in security and won a judgment of $2.5 million, one of the largest such judgments at that time, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found. Francis had severe depression as a direct result of the rape and was a recluse for seven years after the event, returning to public life in 1981.

H. B. Johnson attempted to streamline company operations and cut costs, such as serving cheaper food and having fewer employees. This strategy was unsuccessful because patrons compared this new era of Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants and motor lodges unfavorably to the services they had previously come to know. In a further effort to make the company more successful and profitable, Johnson created other concepts, such as HoJo Campgrounds and 3 Penny Inns for lodging, as well as Deli Baker Ice Cream Maker, and Chatt&#x27;s for restaurants. All of these concepts failed, hastening the company&#x27;s demise.

In the late 1990s, the Howard Johnson&#x27;s Candy Factory and Executive Offices in Wollaston were purchased and renovated by the Eastern Nazarene College to form the Adams Executive Center.

In 1979, Johnson accepted an acquisition bid of more than $630 million from Imperial Group PLC of London, England. Imperial obtained 1,040 restaurants (75% company owned/25% franchised) and 520 motor lodges (75% franchised/25% company-owned). In 1981 Imperial recruited G. Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly executive vice president of Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, despite progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and sold the company. Having declined to entertain Hostage&#x27;s proposal to lead a leveraged buyout, Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage&#x27;s assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986. In a contemporaneous transaction, Marriott sold the motor lodge business and the Howard Johnson trademark to Prime Motor Inns, a New Jersey company.

Marriott was interested in the company-owned restaurants for real estate. Marriott already owned Big Boy Restaurants and Roy Rogers Restaurants. In 1982, it acquired Host International, which had operated a number of highway rest stops. Many of the established Howard Johnson sites were in prime highway locations which could be profitably converted to Big Boy or various fast food banners. As Marriott quickly demolished the company-owned restaurants or converted them to the Bob&#x27;s Big Boy restaurant chain, the number of Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants remaining circa 1985 was sharply reduced. Only the franchised restaurants remained untouched.

Marriott left all company-owned and franchised motor lodges untouched, as the deal called for them to be sold a year later (in 1986) to Prime Motors Inns, an existing franchisee with 63 motels.

===Development since 1990===
Prime Motors Inns continued to preserve the lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990. Those involved with the company owned and franchised motor lodges banded together and formed the Howard Johnson Acquisition Corporation. They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company-owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to &quot;Howard Johnson International Incorporated,&quot; which became a subsidiary of &quot;Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated,&quot; which eventually merged with other companies to form Cendant. In 2006, Cendant split itself into Wyndham Worldwide and three other companies.

Wyndham operated the Howard Johnson brand under several &quot;tiers&quot; based on price, level of amenities, and services offered. Under Cendant/Wyndham, the chain became a parking place for franchise conversions, which were existing independent motels which had been renovated and added to the chain in order to provide them with access to a nationally recognised name and central reservation infrastructure. As these properties were not originally constructed as Howard Johnson sites, they lacked distinctive architecture and some had no restaurant at all. Howard Johnson Express Inns, Howard Johnson Inns, Howard Johnson Hotels, and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotels range from limited-service motels to full-service properties with on-site concierges and business centers. Howard Johnson began offering a &quot;Rise &#x27;N&#x27; Dine&quot; continental breakfast at some economy-limited service locations. The chain abolished the multiple price tiers by 2015.

==Locations==
Despite the hotel chain surviving into the 21st century, its number of locations have significantly dropped in recent years (there are fewer than 140 Howard Johnson hotels left in the United States, where the chain originated). As of May 2024, there are combined 280 Howard Johnson branded properties with the vast majority located in the United States and China with further hotels in Canada, Mexico, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Paraguay.

==Demise of Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants==
While the Howard Johnson Company-owned and franchised motor lodges survived since being sold by the Howard Johnson Company in 1979, the restaurants did not. 

===1980s: Spun-off as independent===
Because Marriott eliminated all the company-owned restaurants, the owners of the franchised restaurants feared elimination and banded together in 1986 to create &quot;Franchise Associates Incorporated&quot; (FAI). In 1986, Marriott gave FAI the right to operate and maintain Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants.

In 1987, FAI chairman George Carter acknowledged that &quot;We have the concept, but it desperately needs to be modernized, internally and externally. Howard Johnson was allowed to become tired and stale. We must get rid of that plastic image... Anything can be salvageable if a great deal of time and money and effort is put in it. And Howard Johnson needs all those same things.&quot;&quot; 

While the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant chain was preserved, FAI did not have enough money to expand to new locations or revamp the brand. With the exception of one Howard Johnson&#x27;s ice cream parlor in Puerto Rico, FAI never opened a new restaurant or expanded the chain.

===1990s: Struggling under FAI===
In 1990, an existing restaurant in Canton, Massachusetts, was remodeled as a prototype for a new era of Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants, but the concept failed, and after less than a decade of operation, the prototype restaurant closed in the spring of 2000. The chain revamped 25% of the menu and created new signage, but the chain continued to lose ground to mass-market fast food operations. When Cendant acquired the Howard Johnson&#x27;s motor lodges, they offered to work together with FAI to ensure the expansion of the restaurant chain. By March 1995, FAI&#x27;s official directory listed just 84 restaurants remaining in the US and Canada.

===2000s: Sharp decline===

By 2005, there were fewer than eight surviving restaurants. FAI ceased operations in 2005, the same year that the Springfield, Vermont, location and the last New York City restaurant in the chain closed.

Cendant acquired the rights to operate and maintain the remaining Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants. In 2006, Cendant sold them to La Mancha Group LLC, which had proposed an aggressive expansion of the restaurant chain that never materialized. After the Waterbury, Connecticut, restaurant became The Brass House Restaurant in April 2007, only three locations remained. Cendant split into four smaller companies in 2006; its hotel group became Wyndham Worldwide while other pieces were spun off separately to become Avis Budget Group, Realogy, Travelport and Affinion Group.

The Howard Johnson-branded frozen foods line was discontinued after Fairfield Farms Kitchens shut down its Brockton, Massachusetts plant in 2006 and America&#x27;s Kitchen of Atlanta, Georgia shut down in May 2008.

===2010s: Fading out===
In spring 2012, one of the last three original Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants closed, in Lake George, and was listed for sale. Television personality, chef and author Rachael Ray once worked at that site while living in Lake George as a teenager. By 2013, only two original restaurants remained open, but the Bangor location no longer had the distinctive orange roof. While the hotel franchise’s HoJo Hotel Plaza locations did include a restaurant, there was no requirement that these replicate menus, format or branding of the former Howard Johnson restaurant chain.

With La Mancha Group LLC no longer active, Wyndham Hotel Group acquired the rights to the HoJo&#x27;s food business as well as the Howard Johnson hotel chain. In 2013, Wyndham proposed a brand reinvigoration which would have brought back select flavors of ice cream, adopted a new logo, phased out the multiple branding tiers, gave the properties a facelift and redesigned the chain as a lower-midscale brand starting in 2015. Wyndham did eventually implement retro-inspired guest room renovations, but most other plans, including those involving food and restaurant operations, were scrapped.

On January 10, 2015, the former Howard Johnson&#x27;s Lake George restaurant reopened as the &quot;Lake George Family Restaurant&quot;, after the location’s lease was transferred from its original owners, DeSantis Enterprises, to John Larock in August 2014. Larock took advantage of a grandfather clause to reopen the restaurant as a Howard Johnson&#x27;s, bringing the number of restaurants back up to three.

On March 31, 2015, the Lake Placid, NY Howard Johnson&#x27;s closed, leaving only two locations remaining. On September 6, 2016, the Bangor restaurant–the last continuously operating restaurant from the original chain, closed; the last remaining location out of the original 1,000-plus. By 2016, only the Lake George restaurant remained.

===2020s: Final closure===

Despite the Lake George restaurant&#x27;s claim as &quot;The Last One Standing&quot;, its authenticity as a true Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant was questioned due to its dissimilar menu and negative reviews. A new from the ground up operation, it lacked a kitchen staff and crew formerly connected or experienced with the Howard Johnson&#x27;s Restaurant chain. While it retained an original building and trademark name, it had no official connection with Wyndham or the defunct FAI, operating entirely as an independent entity.

In January 2017, the Lake George property went up for sale, and redevelopment projects were proposed for the site. On October 12, 2017, owner John Larock was arrested and convicted of sexual harassment of female employees, and on October 31, 2018, began serving a six-month jail sentence. The restaurant continued to operate with Larock as owner, but was open sporadically, with limited days and hours.

In March 2022, the Lake George restaurant permanently closed.

<text>Tanaquil (; Etruscan: &quot;Thanchvil&quot;) was the queen of Rome by marriage to Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth King of Rome.

==Life==
The daughter of a powerful Etruscan family in Tarquinii, Etruria, Tanaquil thought her husband would make a good leader, but since he was the son of an immigrant, he would not be able to gain power in Tarquinii, where they lived. Knowing this, Tanaquil encouraged him to move to Rome, which was not at the time dominated by a strong local aristocracy. Her prophetic abilities helped her to install Tarquin as king and later Servius Tullius as the next king. While on the road to Rome, an eagle flew off with Tarquin&#x27;s hat and then returned it to his head. Tanaquil interpreted this as a sign that the gods wanted him to become a king.

Tanaquil&#x27;s prophecy was eventually realized for Tarquin—he eventually became friends with King Ancus Marcius, who made Tarquin guardian of his children. When the king died before his children were old enough to become successors to the throne, Tarquin used his popularity in the Comitia to be elected the fifth king of Rome. He ruled from 616 to 579 BC.

She had four children, two daughters and two sons, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last king of Rome, and Arruns Tarquinius. One of her daughters, Tarquinia, married Servius Tullius after he had succeeded Tarquinius Priscus as king.

Tanaquil played a role in the rise of Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome. Raising him as her own child, Tanaquil believed Servius would be the next successor to the throne. Her dreams would be realized when, one day Servius was sleeping and his head was surrounded with flames. The fires danced around his head without hurting him and when Servius awoke, the fire disappeared. Taking this as an omen, Tanaquil knew Servius would one day be king. When Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil hid his death from her subjects, instead telling them that Tarquin had been wounded and had himself appointed Servius regent until he got better. After gaining the people&#x27;s respect and commanding the kingship, Servius and Tanaquil announced Tarquin&#x27;s death. The Senate named Servius king, and Tanaquil&#x27;s sons, Lucius and Arruns, married Servius&#x27; daughters, the Tulliae.

==Gaia Caecilia==
In an alternate tradition reported by several Roman chroniclers, Tanaquil changed her name to &quot;Gaia Caecilia&quot; when she arrived at Rome. Under this name she was regarded as the model of womanly virtue, skilled in the domestic arts, particularly spinning and weaving, and she was associated with the origin of various Roman wedding customs.

Pliny reports that in his day, six hundred years later, her spindle and distaff were preserved in the Temple of Sancus, where stood a bronze statue of the queen, together with a purple tunic she had woven for Servius Tullius, and according to some authorities a belt upon which Tanaquil had placed a number of healing charms, and to which miraculous properties were ascribed. Tanaquil was said to have woven the first &quot;tunica recta&quot;, the dress traditionally woven by Roman brides for their wedding day, and it was even supposed that the ancient wedding formula recited by the bride and groom, &quot;ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia&quot; (as you are Gaius, I am Gaia), was a reference to Tanaquil. During the Renaissance, Boccaccio cited Gaia Caecilia (under the name &quot;Gaia Cyrilla&quot;) in his &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; (On Famous Women) as a model of frugality and the simple living style of Roman antiquity.

<doc id="249381" wikidata="Q777762" url="?curid=249381" title="Billy Costello (boxer)">
<text>Billy Costello (born William Donald Castiglioni; April 10, 1956 – June 29, 2011) was a professional boxer in the United States.

==Early life==
Costello was born in Kingston, New York, on April 10, 1956, to a Sicilian father and a mother of Native American, Italian and African American descent, as one of nine children. Costello was active in the Boy Scouts. He played third base on the Kingston High School baseball team and had originally hoped for a career as a professional baseball player.

==Amateur career==
Billy Costello won the 1978 135 pound New York Golden Gloves Open Championship. Costello stopped Raymond Johnson of the United Block Association in the second round to win the Championship. Costello began boxing in the Police Athletic League program in Kingston, and later trained at the Castle Hill Athletic Club in the Bronx, New York.

==Professional career==
During his career, he was managed by Mike Jones, who was also famous for managing Gerry Cooney and Wilford Scypion. Costello fought a lot of his early professional bouts around the Hudson Valley-NYC area, after a successful amateur career that culminated in a Golden Gloves award. The Kew Gardens section of Queens, New York eventually became his home, at least while he was champion. But before winning a title, he put together an early undefeated streak, which included a 10-round decision over Willie Rodriguez on CBS television in November 1982. He and his management then became closely associated with the CBS network, which aired several of his fights.

The one and only title he held in his career, the WBC junior welterweight title, was won by knocking out Bruce Curry in the 10th round in January 1984 in front of a pro-Curry crowd in Beaumont, Texas. He would then make three defenses of the belt, all in Kingston, and all by 12-round unanimous decision. His first foe as champion was Ronnie Shields, with whom he traded first-round knockdowns before eventually securing the points win. Next was former WBC 140-lb. champion and veteran Saoul Mamby, who replaced Leroy Haley, another former possessor of Costello&#x27;s belt, on five days notice. Costello defeated ex-champion Mamby unanimous decision.

His next fight was finally against Leroy Haley. The result was a unanimous win over 12 rounds for Costello. Next, a Denver, Colorado fighter named Lonnie &#x27;Lightning&#x27; Smith defeated him, knocking down and cutting the defending champion en route to an eighth-round stoppage in New York City to claim the title in August 1985.

Billy kept coming back, next fighting three-time champion Alexis Argüello in February 1986. Arguello, behind on points, stopped Costello in Round 4 after knocking him down. Costello then took some time off from the ring, fighting on a sporadic &#x27;here-and-there&#x27; basis until the early 1990s. In his last bout in 1999, he defeated former world champion Juan Laporte by ten round decision in a Pay Per View fight, avenging a 1986 loss to LaPorte by his brother Vinnie. All in all, Costello&#x27;s professional career had lasted an astounding 20 years, from 1979–1999, and ended with a win over a former world champion. His respectable career had only two losses to world champions.

Costello is perhaps best remembered for his stoppage loss to Alexis Arguello.

==Professional boxing record==


==Life After Boxing==
In retirement, Costello worked as a home contractor, active in building and road construction. Costello also served as the volunteer director of the Kingston PAL Boxing Club in Kingston, New York. On evenings and weekends, Costello remained active in pro boxing as a professional boxing judge and referee in New York State at many sanctioned events. There is a Billy Costello Boxing Gym in Kingston, and Costello was involved in boxing shows in the area.

==Book==
Billy Costello&#x27;s championship run was the subject of Thomas Hauser&#x27;s &quot;The Black Lights: Inside the World of Professional Boxing.&quot; One of the most widely heralded books ever written on boxing, Hauser appeared in the Costello training camp during last minute negotiations for a televised bout with substitute challenger Saoul Mamby, was given access to the contractual negotiations, and painted a literary portrait of the inside wheels of boxing as it affected Costello.

==Personal life==
Costello lived most of his life in Kingston, New York. He also lived in Kew Gardens (Queens), New York during much of his reign as champion. He then retired from boxing &amp; moved to New Paltz, New York, a small village in Ulster County, New York near Costello&#x27;s hometown of Kingston, New York. Costello eventually settled back in his hometown of Kingston, New York where he lived until his death. He was married and divorced, and had a son and a daughter, who survive him. He was close with his younger brother Mario &#x27;Vinnie&#x27; Costello, a noted professional boxer super featherweight boxer from 1981-1990 with a pro record of 20-2-2 but who never fought for a title, who trained with his brother under the late Victor Vallee, who also trained Gerry Cooney.

==Death==
According to his mother, Dolores, Costello died of lung cancer at a hospital in his native Kingston on June 29, 2011. He was 55. He was survived by: his parents, Dolores and Billy Costello Sr.; a daughter, Christine Costello, and a son, Brandon, from his marriage to his wife, Jane, which ended in divorce; four living brothers, Stephen, Mario &#x27;Vinnie&#x27; Costello, Anthony, and Glenn; and two sisters, Vicky Costello and Tammy Moody.

<text>Bairoa Gym is a boxing gym located in Caguas, Puerto Rico. &quot;El gimnasio Bairoa&quot;, as it is known in Spanish, is the most famous boxing gym in Puerto Rico because of the list of world champions and top contenders who have trained there. 

==2005 shooting attack==
On March 4, 2005, Bairoa boxer Joseph Serrano, a gold medalist at Central American and Caribbean Games competition as an amateur and 1-0 prospect, was standing near the gym&#x27;s front door, when he was shot three times by an assailant. Serrano was picked up by his father Edwin and by fellow boxer Victor Bisbal and taken to a hospital, where he recuperated from the gunshots. The shooting&#x27;s alleged planner, Jonathan Huertas Claudio was sentenced to 15 years probation for paying $2,000 to Jorge Davila to shoot Serrano. Davila was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 11 years probation.

==Notable boxers==
World champions and well known boxers who have used this facility include Alfredo Escalera, Héctor Camacho, Julian Solís, Henry Bruseles, Juan Cruz, Alberto Mercado, Jesus Rojas, Javier Garcia, Jose Miguel Cotto, Juan Carazo, Miguel Cotto, Daniel Rosario, José Rodriguez, and many more.
The gym was managed since 1976 (year when it was inaugurated) by Cuban trainer Julian Delgado, until Evangelista Cotto replaced him during the late 90s. Bairoa Gym&#x27;s creator Delgado passed away on December 14, 2021, at the age of 91. 

Miguel Cotto became the gym&#x27;s first &quot;homegrown&quot; world champion when he conquered the WBO&#x27;s world Jr. Welterweight title by knocking out Kelson Pinto of Brazil in six rounds in 2004. Cotto built a career that included various world titles and fights with Antonio Margarito, Sergio Martinez, Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Saul Alvarez.

<text>Open spectrum (also known as free spectrum) is a movement to get the Federal Communications Commission to provide more unlicensed radio-frequency spectrum that is available for use by all. Proponents of the &quot;commons model&quot; of open spectrum advocate a future where all the spectrum is shared, and in which people use Internet protocols to communicate with each other, and smart devices, which would find the most effective energy level, frequency, and mechanism. Previous government-imposed limits on who can have stations and who cannot would be removed, and everyone would be given equal opportunity to use the airwaves for their own radio station, television station, or even broadcast their own website. A notable advocate for Open Spectrum is Lawrence Lessig.

National governments currently allocate bands of spectrum (sometimes based on guidelines from the ITU) for use by anyone so long as they respect certain technical limits, most notably, a limit on total transmission power. Unlicensed spectrum is decentralized: there are no license payments or central control for users. However, sharing spectrum between unlicensed equipment requires that mitigation techniques (e.g.: power limitation, duty cycle, dynamic frequency selection) are imposed to ensure that these devices operate without interference.

Traditional users of unlicensed spectrum include cordless telephones, and baby monitors. A collection of new technologies are taking advantage of unlicensed spectrum including Wi-Fi, Ultra Wideband, spread spectrum, software-defined radio, cognitive radio, and mesh networks.

==Radio astronomy needs==
Astronomers use many radio telescopes to look up at objects such as pulsars in our own Galaxy and at distant radio galaxies up to about half the distance of the observable sphere of our Universe. The use of radio frequencies for communication creates pollution from the point of view of astronomers, at best, creating noise or, at worst, totally blinding the astronomical community for certain types of observations of very faint objects. As more and more frequencies are used for communication, astronomical observations are getting more and more difficult.

Negotiations to defend the parts of the spectrum most useful for observing the Universe are mostly carried out by the international astronomical community, as a grassroots community effort, coordinated in the Scientific Committee on Frequency Allocations for Radio Astronomy and Space Science.

<text>Ronald Hatcher Jr. (born June 28, 1959), better known as Gene Hatcher, is an American former professional boxer who was world light welterweight champion. His nickname was &quot;Mad Dog.&quot;

==Amateur career==
Hatcher was a United States Amateur Champion. In 1980, he became National AAU Welterweight Champion.

==Early professional career==
His most notable early win came against former WBC super featherweight champion Alfredo Escalera in 1982, when he won a ten-round decision. His next notable opponent, Tyrone Crawley, defeated him by a ten-round decision. He followed that with a rematch in 1983 with Escalera. In that fight, Hatcher was dropped in round six and subsequently lost a unanimous ten-round decision.

==Champion==
After racking up a few wins, Hatcher faced WBA light welterweight champion Johnny Bumphus on June 1, 1984, in Buffalo, New York. In what Ring magazine called its &quot;Upset of the Year,&quot; Hatcher scored an eleventh-round technical knockout over Bumphus. When Hatcher knocked Bumphus down, he slipped and fell on a follow-up attempt. He then threw Bumphus down to the mat when both fighters clinched. A post-fight melee in the ring ensued after the stoppage.

Hatcher&#x27;s first defense was against Uby Sacco in December of the same year. He won a fifteen-round split decision. Sacco, however, won their July 1985 rematch (and title) with a ninth round knockout win in Italy (the fight was stopped by the referee because of a Hatcher cut). In Hatcher&#x27;s next and last chance at a world crown, he lost by knockout in 45 seconds to Lloyd Honeyghan in August 1987, with Honeyghan&#x27;s WBC and IBF welterweight belts being at stake.

==Post-championship career==
After losing to Honeyghan, Hatcher continued to fight. He had seven more fights, losing two (one of which was to future world champion Aaron Davis). After a victory in Ft. Worth over Juan Martin Galvan in 1995, Hatcher retired.

<text>Charles Kemmons Wilson (January 5, 1913 – February 12, 2003) was an American hotelier. He is best known for founding the hotel chain Holiday Inn in the 1950s.

==Personal life==

He was born in Osceola, Arkansas, the only child of Kemmons and Ruby &quot;Doll&quot; Wilson. His father was an insurance salesman who died when Kemmons was nine months old. Shortly thereafter, his mother, Doll, moved the two to Memphis, Tennessee, where he was raised solely by his mother.

Wilson was married to Dorothy Lee. They had five children: Spence, Robert, Kemmons Jr, Betty, and Carole. Wilson died in Memphis on February 12, 2003, at the age of 90, and is interred there in Forest Hill Cemetery.

==Career==
Wilson initially came up with the idea after a family road trip to Washington, D.C., during which he was disappointed by the quality of the roadside hotels of that era. The name Holiday Inn was given to the original hotel by his architect Eddie Bluestein as a joke, in reference to the 1942 movie of the same name.

Due to prior investments into the property sector, he had already amassed a sizeable fortune which allowed him to pursue his vision of providing his own hotel chain. He opened the first Holiday Inn motel in Memphis in 1952, and quickly added others to create an entire hotel chain. Holiday Inn went international in 1960. Wilson and his financial partner Wallace E. Johnson (1901–1988) were practicing Christians who saw to the placing of a Bible in every one of their hotel rooms and who donated much of their growing fortunes to charitable enterprises.

In 1957, Wilson franchised the chain as Holiday Inn of America and it grew dramatically, following Wilson&#x27;s original tenet that the properties should be standardized, clean, predictable, family-friendly and readily accessible to road travellers.

By 1958, there were 50 locations across the country, 100 by 1959, 500 by 1964, and the 1000th Holiday Inn opened in San Antonio, Texas, in 1968. The chain dominated the motel market, leveraged its innovative Holidex reservation system, put considerable financial pressure on traditional hotels and set the standard for its competitors, like Ramada Inns, Quality Inn, Howard Johnson&#x27;s, and Best Western.

In 1968, Wilson bought Continental Trailways and merged the bus company into Holiday Inn. From then until 1979, when Holiday Inn sold Trailways to private investor Henry Lea Hillman Sr. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Holiday Inn television commercials were prone to show a Trailways bus pulling into the parking lot of a Holiday Inn hotel.

By June 1972, when Wilson was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, there were over 1,400 Holiday Inn hotels worldwide. Innovations like the company&#x27;s Holidome indoor pools turned many hotels into roadside resorts.

Wilson retired from Holiday Inn in 1979. In 1988, Holiday Corporation was purchased by UK-based Bass PLC, followed by the remaining domestic Holiday Inn hotels in 1990, when founder Wilson sold his interest, after which the hotel group was known as Holiday Inn Worldwide.

Wilson was the founder of many different kind of companies such as Holiday Inn Records and Orange Lake Country Club. After selling his shares of Holiday Inn, he formed Wilson World, another hotel chain.

==Basketball team owner==
In July 1974, Wilson, along with Isaac Hayes, Al Wilson, Mike Storen and others, bought the Memphis Tams franchise in the American Basketball Association. They changed the team to the Memphis Sounds. They quickly built a strong roster, obtaining players such as Mel Daniels and Rick Mount. The team was the most successful pro basketball team that Memphis ever fielded; it finished fourth in the ABA&#x27;s Eastern Division, advancing to the 1975 ABA Playoffs before losing the Eastern Division semifinal series four games to one to the eventual 1975 ABA champion Kentucky Colonels.

Following the season, the Sounds were sold to a group in Baltimore, Maryland, where they moved to become the short-lived Baltimore Claws.

==Legacy==
His 1996 autobiography, &quot;Half Luck and Half Brains&quot;, tells the story of Holiday Inn.

Wilson was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1982.

In 1965, Wilson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

The Kemmons Wilson School of Hospitality and Resort Management at the University of Memphis is named in his honor.

<doc id="249396" wikidata="Q5500229" url="?curid=249396" title="Free flight (air traffic control)">
<text>Free flight is a developing air traffic control method that uses no centralized control (e.g. air traffic controllers). Instead, parts of airspace are reserved dynamically and automatically in a distributed way using computer communication to ensure the required separation between aircraft. This new system may be implemented into the U.S. air traffic control system in the next decade. Its potential impact on the operations of the national airspace system is disputed, however.

==Overview==
Free flight is a new concept being developed to take the place of the current air traffic management methods through the use of technology. True free flight eliminates the need for air traffic control (ATC) operators by giving the responsibility to the pilot in command. This gives the pilot the ability to change trajectory in mid-flight. With the aid of computer systems and/or ATC, pilots will be able to make more flight path decisions independently. As in most complex systems, distributed yet cooperative decision making is believed to be more efficient than the centralized control characterized by the current mode of air traffic management.

==History==

Free flight began as an effort to become less dependent on the human factor and more dependent on the growing technology of its day. As airlines expanded their fleets in the 1960s, they increased the need for air traffic management (ATM). ATM created instrument flight rules (commonly known as &quot;IFR&quot;) to manage the growing numbers of aircraft. This helped control air traffic, but required a significant amount of time, effort, and resources to maintain IFR flight.

In 1968, the Federal Aviation Administration issued the High Density Airport Rule to reduce the number of aircraft in a given airport. Twenty years earlier Crocker Snow used television cameras to locate his position when flying an aircraft. He sent up signals to the aircraft so they could get a third person perspective of the aircraft&#x27;s surrounding. This idea worked but was too costly and was impractical. In the 1960s transponders removed the need to use television cameras.

Other problems that occurred in the air traffic industry were the OPEC fuel crises and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike of 1982 resulting in the firing of thousands of controllers by President Ronald Reagan. This showed how vulnerable air transportation was to economic forces.

The key components of free flight were identified in 1971 by United Airlines systems manager William Cotton, although the technology to implement it was not available for another two decades.

In the 1970&#x27;s the GPS satellite navigation system was deployed by the US Department of Defense and the aviation industry saw the opportunity to use GPS for potentially more efficient air traffic management capabilities through an increased use of this capability coupled with automation enabled by it.

In 1991 the International Civil Aviation Organization created the Future Air Navigation System Panel. The panel produced descriptions of satellite-based technology applications and their use in air traffic management. A larger role emerged for &quot;user-defined trajectory&quot; that became known as &quot;free flight&quot; by the mid-1990s.

The first hearings on implementing free flight were held in August 1994 by Representative Collin Peterson (D-Minnesota), chair of the House subcommittee with investigative jurisdiction over the FAA.

In 1995 David Hinson, the FAA administrator, organized a task force to draw up detailed plans to implement free flight. The report, issued in October that year called for three phases; phase I ended at the end of 2002, the others have not been started. A method and system for an automated tool to enable en route traffic controllers to optimize aircraft routes dynamically was patented by the NASA in 2001.

True free flight applications exist only on a small scale in selected airspace operations where only the most well equipped aircraft operate, such as at high altitude by commercial airliners. There are many versions of free flight being conceived for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). The free flight vision is expected to slowly emerge over the next 20–30 years as NGATS emerges from billions of dollars of development, testing, careful transition planning, training, and deployment of ground-based and airborne systems by all types of aircraft. Key elements of NGATS include the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and what can be expected to be an ever-evolving, net-centric information application called the System Wide Information Management System or &quot;SWIM&quot;.

== Regions ==

The regions are broken up into unrestricted, transition, and restricted.

; Unrestricted
:In the unrestricted region there will be very little guidance from ATC since aircraft density will be low. Pilots will have a great deal of flexibility to exercise free flight in this area. However, it may become complicated when bad weather is calculated into the equation. Pilots may have to adjust their course to avoid inclement weather. In doing so other pilots attempting to avoid the conditions may cross path with each other. ATC will have to assist the pilots and guide them through this issue. 
;Transition
:Slightly restricted however pilots retain some flexibility to exercise free flight.

;Restricted
:The freedom of the pilot has been restricted significantly.

== Approaches of free flight ==

There are several approaches that free flight can move towards.

===Airborne===

In the airborne approach, the separation responsibility is entirely with the pilots, operating under self separation conditions. The pilot is responsible for detecting and resolving problems while in flight. Computers will help aid the aircrew in this matter. Information, such as weather reports or other aircraft position, is forwarded from ATC (or automated stations) to the aircraft so the pilots can decide the best course of action to take. The surveillance system can either be on the ground or on board the aircraft.

Problems with this method include complete surveillance information assurance, communication with different equipment, smaller aircraft incapable of carrying the equipment, and the possibility of a system malfunctioning. It is extremely difficult to have total assurance of all air traffic. If two aircraft flying with different equipment encounter each other, the equipment&#x27;s data will have to be sent to the receiving equipment as well as the normal information such as speed. Larger planes will have no problems with the equipment, but smaller aircraft will have problems communicating to each other if it lacks an essential component. Surely, if this was a one-on-one scenario, it would be easy to solve, but if multiple aircraft were involved, the difficulty of finding a solution compounds. Lastly, if a system fails or the software has a computer programming error, the aircraft and other aircraft will be flying blind.

===Ground===

All of the data are sent to ATC and pilot requests a particular flight path. Communication will be from aircraft to ATC instead of aircraft to aircraft.
In this approach the aircrew will not have the full situational awareness experience in the airborne approach. Aircrew will not be able to handle uncertainties or help out with the uncertainties in this approach. If one aircraft does not follow the directive ATC issues, the directive will have to be reissued and in turn increase the workload of ATM operators.

===Mixed focus===

Mixed focus approach which is a combination of both the airborne and ground approach. AOC initially sends route to aircraft and ATM. If the aircrew does not like the route, it sends the route changes to ATM and AOC.

==Separation==

Aircraft separation is divided up into the &quot;protected zone&quot; and the &quot;alert zone&quot;. In the larger zone, called the &quot;alert zone&quot;, the system informs the aircraft through one of the three approaches that an aircraft is in the vicinity. It acts as a flag and merely alerts the aircrew. In the protected zone, the area must remain sterile of all foreign objects. It is the minimum distance anything can approach. The system should alert the aircrew before anything comes close to it, but if it manages to enter the protected zone, aircrew will take evasive maneuver to avoid a collision.

==Conflict and detection method using center-TRACON automation system==

Center-TRACON automation system (CTAS) receives data from aircraft trajectory, atmospheric model, aircraft performance, and other contributing factors. Based on the information it receives it will calculate the best trajectory though equations and logic. CTAS is currently being used on a small scale.

<text>Biosophy, meaning &quot;wisdom of life&quot;, is &quot;the science and art of intelligent living based on the awareness and practice of spiritual values, ethical-social principles and character qualities essential to individual freedom and social harmony&quot;. It stands in relation to biology, which can be broadly described as the &quot;understanding of life&quot;.

==History==
The term &quot;Biosophy&quot; was probably first used in 1806 by Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler, a Swiss philosopher whose early works followed F. W. J. Schelling. It was later used by other philosophers like Peter Wessel Zapffe (1899–1990), who used biology as the foundation of his philosophy. Zapffe first set out his ideas in &quot;Den sidste Messias&quot; (en. &quot;The Last Messiah&quot;) (1933). Later Zapffe gave a more systematic defence in his philosophical treatise &quot;Om det tragiske&quot; (en. &quot;On the tragic&quot;) (1941). The Biosophical Institute claims that Frederick Kettner (1886-1957) was the founder of Biosophy. Kettner was himself originally inspired by the organicism of Constantin Brunner.

Contemporary biosophers include Jong Bhak, who defines Biosophy as a &quot;new way of performing philosophy generated from scientific and biological awareness&quot;. Bhak developed his theory of Biosophy while studying at Cambridge University in 1995 and afterwards. The main difference of Bhak&#x27;s biosophy from other philosophy is that his biosophy is a computable philosophy. It borrows Bertrand Russell logicism and extends it to a computational set of ideas and knowledge. One ultimate aim of biosophy is to construct a logical thinking machine that can do philosophy for human beings.

==Biosophy Program==
The Biosophy Program was presented on the internet by Anna Öhman and Svenolov Lindgren in January 1998. They noted that &quot;the term biosophy was previously used by Zapffe (1941) in a literary context for the analysis of human social life based on philosophy of existence and biological facts. Such a narrow circumscription of biosophy is in our opinion no obstacle to widen the definition to encompass all systematic thinking on biological issues.&quot;

The Biosophy Program was intended to circumscribe and systemize biological studies in a philosophical framework to support teaching at courses on philosophy and courses on biology. The biosophical thinking is defined by Öhman and Lindgren in five philosophical fields and discriminated from Næss’ ecosophy.

==Objectives==
* To create biosophical groups for character and peace education where the individual has opportunities of self-improvement.
* To encourage integration among individuals based on their mutual interest in a spiritual purpose in life.
* To network with other groups and organizations interested in character and peace education working cooperatively with them.
* To replace the blind acceptance of theological beliefs, superstitions and dogmas with the cultivation of spiritual intelligence as the basis for the Religion of Freedom and Friendship.
* To create a world-fellowship of peace-loving human beings who have overcome religious, national, racial and social prejudices who can work creatively for the growth of democracy, spiritual personal growth and world peace.
* To work for the synthesis of religion, philosophy, science, education and art.
* To perpetuate and advance Kettner&#x27;s principles and work for the development and cultivation of the character and peace nature in young people.
* To create a Peace Department in national governments headed by a Secretary of Peace, and to establish peace universities.
* To establish a world-fellowship of thinking human beings who can work creatively for the growth of spiritual democracy and world peace.
* To cooperate in the advancement of humanity from civilization to the age of &quot;soulization&quot;.

<text>A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that can be used for entering data into, and transcribing data from, a computer or a computing system. Most early computers only had a front panel to input or display bits and had to be connected to a terminal to print or input text through a keyboard. Teleprinters were used as early-day hard-copy terminals and predated the use of a computer screen by decades. The computer would typically transmit a line of data which would be printed on paper, and accept a line of data from a keyboard over a serial or other interface. Starting in the mid-1970s with microcomputers such as the Sphere 1, Sol-20, and Apple I, display circuitry and keyboards began to be integrated into personal and workstation computer systems, with the computer handling character generation and outputting to a CRT display such as a computer monitor or, sometimes, a consumer TV, but most larger computers continued to require terminals.

Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards or paper tape for input; with the advent of time-sharing systems, terminals slowly pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry. Related developments were the improvement of terminal technology and the introduction of inexpensive video displays. Early Teletypes only printed out with a communications speed of only 75 baud or 10 5-bit characters per second, and by the 1970s speeds of video terminals had improved to 2400 or 9600 . Similarly, the speed of remote batch terminals had improved to at the beginning of the decade and by the end of the decade, with higher speeds possible on more expensive terminals.

The function of a terminal is typically confined to transcription and input of data; a device with significant local, programmable data-processing capability may be called a &quot;smart terminal&quot; or fat client. A terminal that depends on the host computer for its processing power is called a &quot;dumb terminal&quot; or a thin client. In the era of serial (RS-232) terminals there was a conflicting usage of the term &quot;smart terminal&quot; as a dumb terminal with no user-accessible local computing power but a particularly rich set of control codes for manipulating the display; this conflict was not resolved before hardware serial terminals became obsolete.

The use of terminals decreased over time as computing shifted from command line interface (CLI) to graphical user interface (GUI) and from time-sharing on large computers to personal computers and handheld devices. Today, users generally interact with a server over high-speed networks using a Web browser and other network-enabled GUI applications. Today, a terminal emulator application provides the capabilities of a physical terminal allowing interaction with the operating system shell and other CLI applications.

==History==
The console of Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Z3 had a keyboard in 1941, as did the Z4 in 1942–1945. However, these consoles could only be used to enter numeric inputs and were thus analogous to those of calculating machines; programs, commands, and other data were entered via paper tape. Both machines had a row of display lamps for results.

In 1956, the Whirlwind Mark I computer became the first computer equipped with a keyboard-printer combination with which to support direct input of data and commands and output of results. That device was a Friden Flexowriter, which would continue to serve this purpose on many other early computers well into the 1960s.

==Categories==

===Hard-copy terminals===

Early user terminals connected to computers were, like the Flexowriter, electromechanical teleprinters/teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY), such as the Teletype Model 33, originally used for telegraphy; early Teletypes were typically configured as Keyboard Send-Receive (KSR) or Automatic Send-Receive (ASR). Some terminals, such as the ASR Teletype models, included a paper tape reader and punch which could record output such as a program listing. The data on the tape could be re-entered into the computer using the tape reader on the teletype, or printed to paper. Teletypes used the current loop interface that was already used in telegraphy. A less expensive Read Only (RO) configuration was available for the Teletype.

Custom-designs keyboard/printer terminals that came later included the IBM 2741 (1965) and the DECwriter (1970). Respective top speeds of teletypes, IBM 2741 and the LA30 (an early DECwriter) were 10, 15 and 30
characters per second. Although at that time &quot;paper was king&quot; the speed of interaction was relatively limited.

The DECwriter was the last major printing-terminal product. It faded away after 1980 under pressure from video display units (VDUs), with the last revision (the DECwriter IV of 1982) abandoning the classic teletypewriter form for one more resembling a desktop printer.

===Video display unit===
A video display unit (VDU) displays information on a screen rather than printing text to paper and typically uses a cathode-ray tube (CRT). VDUs in the 1950s were typically designed for displaying graphical data rather than text and were used in, e.g., experimental computers at institutions such as MIT; computers used in academia, government and business, sold under brand names such as DEC, ERA, IBM and UNIVAC; military computers supporting specific defence applications such as ballistic missile warning systems and radar/air defence coordination systems such as BUIC and SAGE.
Two early landmarks in the development of the VDU were the Univac Uniscope and the IBM 2260, both in 1964. These were block-mode terminals designed to display a page at a time, using proprietary protocols; in contrast to character-mode devices, they enter data from the keyboard into a display buffer rather than transmitting them immediately. In contrast to later character-mode devices, the Uniscope used synchronous serial communication over an EIA RS-232 interface to communicate between the multiplexer and the host, while the 2260 used either a channel connection or asynchronous serial communication between the 2848 and the host. The 2265, related to the 2260, also used asynchronous serial communication.

The Datapoint 3300 from Computer Terminal Corporation, announced in 1967 and shipped in 1969, was a character-mode device that emulated a Model 33 Teletype. This reflects the fact that early character-mode terminals were often deployed to replace teletype machines as a way to reduce operating costs.
The next generation of VDUs went beyond teletype emulation with an addressable cursor that gave them the ability to paint two-dimensional displays on the screen. Very early VDUs with cursor addressibility included the VT05 and the Hazeltine 2000 operating in character mode, both from 1970. Despite this capability, early devices of this type were often called &quot;Glass TTYs&quot;. Later, the term &quot;glass TTY&quot; tended to be restrospectively narrowed to devices without full cursor addressibility.

The classic era of the VDU began in the early 1970s and was closely intertwined with the rise of time sharing computers. Important early products were the ADM-3A, VT52, and VT100. These devices used no complicated CPU, instead relying on individual logic gates, LSI chips, or microprocessors such as the Intel 8080. This made them inexpensive and they quickly became extremely popular input-output devices on many types of computer system, often replacing earlier and more expensive printing terminals.

After 1970 several suppliers gravitated to a set of common standards:

* ASCII character set (rather than, say, EBCDIC or anything specific to one company), but early/economy models often supported only capital letters (such as the original ADM-3, the Data General model 6052 – which could be upgraded to a 6053 with a lower-case character ROM – and the Heathkit H9)
* RS-232 serial ports (25-pin, ready to connect to a modem, yet some manufacturer-specific pin usage extended the standard, e.g. for use with 20-mA current loops)
* 24 lines (or possibly 25 – sometimes a special status line) of 72 or 80 characters of text (80 was the same as IBM punched cards). Later models sometimes had two character-width settings.
* Some type of cursor that can be positioned (with arrow keys or &quot;home&quot; and other direct cursor address setting codes).
* Implementation of at least 3 control codes: Carriage Return (Ctrl-M), Line-Feed (Ctrl-J), and Bell (Ctrl-G), but usually many more, such as escape sequences to provide underlining, dim or reverse-video character highlighting, and especially to clear the display and position the cursor.

The experimental era of serial VDUs culminated with the VT100 in 1978. By the early 1980s, there were dozens of manufacturers of terminals, including Lear-Siegler, ADDS, Data General, DEC, Hazeltine Corporation, Heath/Zenith, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, TeleVideo, Volker-Craig, and Wyse, many of which had incompatible command sequences (although many used the early ADM-3 as a starting point).

The great variations in the control codes between makers gave rise to software that identified and grouped terminal types so the system software would correctly display input forms using the appropriate control codes; In Unix-like systems the termcap or terminfo files, the stty utility, and the TERM environment variable would be used; in Data General&#x27;s Business BASIC software, for example, at login-time a sequence of codes were sent to the terminal to try to read the cursor&#x27;s position or the 25th line&#x27;s contents using a sequence of different manufacturer&#x27;s control code sequences, and the terminal-generated response would determine a single-digit number (such as 6 for Data General Dasher terminals, 4 for ADM 3A/5/11/12 terminals, 0 or 2 for TTYs with no special features) that would be available to programs to say which set of codes to use.

The great majority of terminals were monochrome, manufacturers variously offering green, white or amber and sometimes blue screen phosphors. (Amber was claimed to reduce eye strain). Terminals with modest color capability were also available but not widely used; for example, a color version of the popular Wyse WY50, the WY350, offered 64 shades on each character cell.

VDUs were eventually displaced from most applications by networked personal computers, at first slowly after 1985 and with increasing speed in the 1990s. However, they had a lasting influence on PCs. The keyboard layout of the VT220 terminal strongly influenced the Model M shipped on IBM PCs from 1985, and through it all later computer keyboards.

Although flat-panel displays were available since the 1950s, cathode-ray tubes continued to dominate the market until the personal computer had made serious inroads into the display terminal market. By the time cathode-ray tubes on PCs were replaced by flatscreens after the year 2000, the hardware computer terminal was nearly obsolete.

===Character-oriented terminals===
A character-oriented terminal is a type of computer terminal that communicates with its host one character at a time, as opposed to a block-oriented terminal that communicates in blocks of data. It is the most common type of data terminal, because it is easy to implement and program. Connection to the mainframe computer or terminal server is achieved via RS-232 serial links, Ethernet or other proprietary protocols.

Character-oriented terminals can be &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;smart&quot;. Dumb terminals are those that can interpret a limited number of control codes (CR, LF, etc.) but do not have the ability to process special escape sequences that perform functions such as clearing a line, clearing the screen, or controlling cursor position. In this context dumb terminals are sometimes dubbed &quot;glass Teletypes&quot;, for they essentially have the same limited functionality as does a mechanical Teletype. This type of dumb terminal is still supported on modern Unix-like systems by setting the environment variable to . Smart or intelligent terminals are those that also have the ability to process escape sequences, in particular the VT52, VT100 or ANSI escape sequences.

====Text terminals====
A text terminal, or often just &quot;terminal&quot; (sometimes &quot;text console&quot;) is a serial computer interface for text entry and display. Information is presented as an array of pre-selected formed characters. When such devices use a video display such as a cathode-ray tube, they are called a &quot;video display unit&quot; or &quot;visual display unit&quot; (VDU) or &quot;video display terminal&quot; (VDT).

The system console is often a text terminal used to operate a computer. Modern computers have a built-in keyboard and display for the console. Some Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD have virtual consoles to provide several text terminals on a single computer.

The fundamental type of application running on a text terminal is a command-line interpreter or &quot;shell&quot;, which prompts for commands from the user and executes each command after a press of . This includes Unix shells and some interactive programming environments. In a shell, most of the commands are small applications themselves.

Another important application type is that of the text editor. A text editor typically occupies the full area of display, displays one or more text documents, and allows the user to edit the documents. The text editor has, for many uses, been replaced by the word processor, which usually provides rich formatting features that the text editor lacks. The first word processors used text to communicate the structure of the document, but later word processors operate in a graphical environment and provide a WYSIWYG simulation of the formatted output. However, text editors are still used for documents containing markup such as DocBook or LaTeX.

Programs such as Telix and Minicom control a modem and the local terminal to let the user interact with remote servers. On the Internet, telnet and ssh work similarly.

In the simplest form, a text terminal is like a file. Writing to the file displays the text and reading from the file produces what the user enters. In Unix-like operating systems, there are several character special files that correspond to available text terminals. For other operations, there are special escape sequences, control characters and codice_1 functions that a program can use, most easily via a library such as &quot;ncurses&quot;. For more complex operations, the programs can use terminal specific &quot;ioctl&quot; system calls. For an application, the simplest way to use a terminal is to simply write and read text strings to and from it sequentially. The output text is scrolled, so that only the last several lines (typically 24) are visible. Unix systems typically buffer the input text until the Enter key is pressed, so the application receives a ready string of text. In this mode, the application need not know much about the terminal. For many interactive applications this is not sufficient. One of the common enhancements is &quot;command-line editing&quot; (assisted with such libraries as readline); it also may give access to command history. This is very helpful for various interactive command-line interpreters.

Even more advanced interactivity is provided with &quot;full-screen&quot; applications. Those applications completely control the screen layout; also they respond to key-pressing immediately. This mode is very useful for text editors, file managers and web browsers. In addition, such programs control the color and brightness of text on the screen, and decorate it with underline, blinking and special characters (e.g. box-drawing characters). To achieve all this, the application must deal not only with plain text strings, but also with control characters and escape sequences, which allow moving the cursor to an arbitrary position, clearing portions of the screen, changing colors and displaying special characters, and also responding to function keys. The great problem here is that there are many different terminals and terminal emulators, each with its own set of escape sequences. In order to overcome this, special libraries (such as curses) have been created, together with terminal description databases, such as Termcap and Terminfo.

===Block-oriented terminals===
A block-oriented terminal or block mode terminal is a type of computer terminal that communicates with its host in blocks of data, as opposed to a character-oriented terminal that communicates with its host one character at a time. A block-oriented terminal may be card-oriented, display-oriented, keyboard-display, keyboard-printer, printer or some combination.

The IBM 3270 is perhaps the most familiar implementation of a block-oriented display terminal, but most mainframe computer manufacturers and several other companies produced them. The description below is in terms of the 3270, but similar considerations apply to other types.

Block-oriented terminals typically incorporate a buffer which stores one screen or more of data, and also stores data attributes, not only indicating appearance (color, brightness, blinking, etc.) but also marking the data as being enterable by the terminal operator vs. &quot;protected&quot; against entry, as allowing the entry of only numeric information vs. allowing any characters, etc. In a typical application the host sends the terminal a preformatted panel containing both static data and fields into which data may be entered. The terminal operator keys data, such as updates in a database entry, into the appropriate fields. When entry is complete (or ENTER or PF key pressed on 3270s), a block of data, usually just the data entered by the operator (modified data), is sent to the host in one transmission. The 3270 terminal buffer (at the device) could be updated on a single character basis, if necessary, because of the existence of a &quot;set buffer address order&quot; (SBA), that usually preceded any data to be written/overwritten within the buffer. A complete buffer could also be read or replaced using the codice_2 command or codice_3 command (unformatted or formatted in the case of the 3270).

Block-oriented terminals cause less system load on the host and less network traffic than character-oriented terminals. They also appear more responsive to the user, especially over slow connections, since editing within a field is done locally rather than depending on echoing from the host system.

Early terminals had limited editing capabilities – 3270 terminals, for example, only could check entries as valid numerics. Subsequent &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; terminals incorporated microprocessors and supported more local processing.

Programmers of block-oriented terminals often used the technique of storing &quot;context&quot; information for the transaction in progress on the screen, possibly in a hidden field, rather than depending on a running program to keep track of status. This was the precursor of the HTML technique of storing context in the URL as data to be passed as arguments to a CGI program.

Unlike a character-oriented terminal, where typing a character into the last position of the screen usually causes the terminal to scroll down one line, entering data into the last screen position on a block-oriented terminal usually causes the cursor to &quot;wrap&quot;— move to the start of the first enterable field. Programmers might &quot;protect&quot; the last screen position to prevent inadvertent wrap. Likewise a protected field following an enterable field might lock the keyboard and sound an audible alarm if the operator attempted to enter more data into the field than allowed.

===Graphical terminals===

A graphical terminal can display images as well as text. Graphical terminals are divided into vector-mode terminals, and raster mode.

A vector-mode display directly draws lines on the face of a cathode-ray tube under control of the host computer system. The lines are continuously formed, but since the speed of electronics is limited, the number of concurrent lines that can be displayed at one time is limited. Vector-mode displays were historically important but are no longer used.
Practically all modern graphic displays are raster-mode, descended from the picture scanning techniques used for television, in which the visual elements are a rectangular array of pixels. Since the raster image is only perceptible to the human eye as a whole for a very short time, the raster must be refreshed many times per second to give the appearance of a persistent display. The electronic demands of refreshing display memory meant that graphic terminals were developed much later than text terminals, and initially cost much more.

Most terminals today are graphical; that is, they can show images on the screen. The modern term for graphical terminal is &quot;thin client&quot;. A thin client typically uses a protocol such as X11 for Unix terminals, or RDP for Microsoft Windows. The bandwidth needed depends on the protocol used, the resolution, and the color depth.

Modern graphic terminals allow display of images in color, and of text in varying sizes, colors, and fonts (type faces).

In the early 1990s, an industry consortium attempted to define a standard, AlphaWindows, that would allow a single CRT screen to implement multiple windows, each of which was to behave as a distinct terminal. Unfortunately, like I2O, this suffered from being run as a closed standard: non-members were unable to obtain even minimal information and there was no realistic way a small company or independent developer could join the consortium.

===Intelligent terminals===
An intelligent terminal does its own processing, usually implying a microprocessor is built in, but not all terminals with microprocessors did any real processing of input: the main computer to which it was attached would have to respond quickly to each keystroke. The term &quot;intelligent&quot; in this context dates from 1969.

Notable examples include the IBM 2250, predecessor to the IBM 3250 and IBM 5080, and IBM 2260, predecessor to the IBM 3270, introduced with System/360 in 1964.
Most terminals were connected to minicomputers or mainframe computers and often had a green or amber screen. Typically terminals communicate with the computer via a serial port via a null modem cable, often using an EIA RS-232 or RS-422 or RS-423 or a current loop serial interface. IBM systems typically communicated over a Bus and Tag channel, a coaxial cable using a proprietary protocol, a communications link using Binary Synchronous Communications or IBM&#x27;s SNA protocol, but for many DEC, Data General and NCR (and so on) computers there were many visual display suppliers competing against the computer manufacturer for terminals to expand the systems. In fact, the instruction design for the Intel 8008 was originally conceived at Computer Terminal Corporation as the processor for the Datapoint 2200.

From the introduction of the IBM 3270, and the DEC VT100 (1978), the user and programmer could notice significant advantages in VDU technology improvements, yet not all programmers used the features of the new terminals (backward compatibility in the VT100 and later TeleVideo terminals, for example, with &quot;dumb terminals&quot; allowed programmers to continue to use older software).

Some dumb terminals had been able to respond to a few escape sequences without needing microprocessors: they used multiple printed circuit boards with many integrated circuits; the single factor that classed a terminal as &quot;intelligent&quot; was its ability to &quot;process&quot; user-input within the terminal—not interrupting the main computer at each keystroke—and send a block of data at a time (for example: when the user has finished a whole field or form). Most terminals in the early 1980s, such as ADM-3A, TVI912, Data General D2, DEC VT52, despite the introduction of ANSI terminals in 1978, were essentially &quot;dumb&quot; terminals, although some of them (such as the later ADM and TVI models) did have a primitive block-send capability. Common early uses of local processing power included features that had little to do with off-loading data processing from the host computer but added useful features such as printing to a local printer, buffered serial data transmission and serial handshaking (to accommodate higher serial transfer speeds), and more sophisticated character attributes for the display, as well as the ability to switch emulation modes to mimic competitor&#x27;s models, that became increasingly important selling features during the 1980s especially, when buyers could mix and match different suppliers&#x27; equipment to a greater extent than before.

The advance in microprocessors and lower memory costs made it possible for the terminal to handle editing operations such as inserting characters within a field that may have previously required a full screen-full of characters to be re-sent from the computer, possibly over a slow modem line. Around the mid-1980s most intelligent terminals, costing less than most dumb terminals would have a few years earlier, could provide enough user-friendly local editing of data and send the completed form to the main computer. Providing even more processing possibilities, workstations such as the TeleVideo TS-800 could run CP/M-86, blurring the distinction between terminal and Personal Computer.

Another of the motivations for development of the microprocessor was to simplify and reduce the electronics required in a terminal. That also made it practicable to load several &quot;personalities&quot; into a single terminal, so a Qume QVT-102 could emulate many popular terminals of the day, and so be sold into organizations that did not wish to make any software changes. Frequently emulated terminal types included:
* Lear Siegler ADM-3A and later models
* TeleVideo 910 to 950 (these models copied ADM3 codes and added several of their own, eventually being copied by Qume and others)
* Digital Equipment Corporation VT52 and VT100
* Data General D1 to D3 and especially D200 and D210
* Hazeltine Corporation H1500
* Tektronix 4014
* Wyse W50, W60 and W99

The ANSI X3.64 escape code standard produced uniformity to some extent, but significant differences remained. For example, the VT100, Heathkit H19 in ANSI mode, Televideo 970, Data General D460, and Qume QVT-108 terminals all followed the ANSI standard, yet differences might exist in codes from function keys, what character attributes were available, block-sending of fields within forms, &quot;foreign&quot; character facilities, and handling of printers connected to the back of the screen.

In the 21st century, 
the term &quot;Intelligent Terminal&quot; can now refer to a retail Point of Sale computer.

===Contemporary===

Even though the early IBM PC looked somewhat like a terminal with a green monochrome monitor, it is not classified a terminal since it provides local computing instead of interacting with a server at a character level. With terminal emulator software, a PC can, however, provide the function of a terminal to interact with a mainframe or minicomputer. Eventually, personal computers greatly reduced market demand for conventional terminals.

In and around the 1990s, &quot;thin client&quot; and X terminal technology combined the relatively economical local processing power with central, shared computer facilities to leverage advantages of terminals over personal computers.

In a GUI environment, such as the X Window System, the display can show multiple programs each in its own window rather than a single stream of text associated with a single program. As a terminal emulator runs in a GUI environment to provide command-line access, it alleviates the need for a physical terminal and allows for multiple windows running separate emulators.

== System console ==

One meaning of system console, computer console, root console, operator&#x27;s console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger. It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a printer or screen, and traditionally is a text terminal, but may also be a graphical terminal.

Another, older, meaning of system console, computer console, hardware console, operator&#x27;s console or simply console is a hardware component used by an operator to control the hardware, typically some combination of front panel, keyboard/printer and keyboard/display.

=== History ===

Prior to the development of alphanumeric CRT system consoles, some computers such as the IBM 1620 had console typewriters and front panels while the very first electronic stored-program computer, the Manchester Baby, used a combination of electromechanical switches and a CRT to provide console functions—the CRT displaying memory contents in binary by mirroring the machine&#x27;s Williams-Kilburn tube CRT-based RAM.

Some early operating systems supported either a single keyboard/print or keyboard/display device for controlling the OS. Some also supported a single alternate console, and some supported a hardcopy console for retaining a record of commands, responses and other console messages. However, in the late 1960s it became common for operating systems to support many more consoles than 3, and operating systems began appearing in which the console was simply any terminal with a privileged user logged on.

On early minicomputers, the console was a serial console, an RS-232 serial link to a terminal such as a ASR-33 or, later, a terminal from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), e.g., DECWriter, VT100. This terminal was usually kept in a secured room since it could be used for certain privileged functions such as halting the system or selecting which media to boot from. Large midrange systems, e.g. those from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, still use serial consoles. In larger installations, the console ports are attached to multiplexers or network-connected multiport serial servers that let an operator connect a terminal to any of the attached servers. Today, serial consoles are often used for accessing headless systems, usually with a terminal emulator running on a laptop. Also, routers, enterprise network switches and other telecommunication equipment have RS-232 serial console ports.

On PCs and workstations, the computer&#x27;s attached keyboard and monitor have the equivalent function. Since the monitor cable carries video signals, it cannot be extended very far. Often, installations with many servers therefore use keyboard/video multiplexers (KVM switches) and possibly video amplifiers to centralize console access. In recent years, KVM/IP devices have become available that allow a remote computer to view the video output and send keyboard input via any TCP/IP network and therefore the Internet.

Some PC BIOSes, especially in servers, also support serial consoles, giving access to the BIOS through a serial port so that the simpler and cheaper serial console infrastructure can be used. Even where BIOS support is lacking, some operating systems, e.g. FreeBSD and Linux, can be configured for serial console operation either during bootup, or after startup.

Starting with the IBM 9672, IBM large systems have used a Hardware Management Console (HMC), consisting of a PC and a specialized application, instead of a 3270 or serial link. Other IBM product lines also use an HMC, e.g., System p.

It is usually possible to log in from the console. Depending on configuration, the operating system may treat a login session from the console as being more trustworthy than a login session from other sources.

==Emulation==
A terminal emulator is a piece of software that emulates a text terminal. In the past, before the widespread use of local area networks and broadband internet access, many computers would use a serial access program to communicate with other computers via telephone line or serial device.

When the first Macintosh was released, a program called MacTerminal was used to communicate with many computers, including the IBM PC.

The Win32 console on Windows does not emulate a physical terminal that supports escape sequences so SSH and Telnet programs (for logging in textually to remote computers) for Windows, including the Telnet program bundled with some versions of Windows, often incorporate their own code to process escape sequences.

The terminal emulators on most Unix-like systems—such as, for example, gnome-terminal, Konsole, QTerminal, xterm, and Terminal.app—do emulate physical terminals including support for escape sequences; e.g., xterm can emulate the VT220 and Tektronix 4010 hardware terminals.

==Modes==
Terminals can operate in various modes, relating to when they send input typed by the user on the keyboard to the receiving system (whatever that may be):
* Character mode ( character-at-a-time mode): In this mode, typed input is unbuffered and sent immediately to the receiving system.
* Line mode ( line-at-a-time mode): In this mode, the terminal is buffered, provides a local line editing function, and sends an entire input line, after it has been locally edited, when the user presses an, e.g., , , key. A so-called &quot;line mode terminal&quot; operates solely in this mode.
* Block mode ( screen-at-a-time mode): In this mode (also called block-oriented), the terminal is buffered and provides a local full-screen data function. The user can enter input into multiple fields in a form on the screen (defined to the terminal by the receiving system), moving the cursor around the screen using keys such as  and the arrow keys and performing editing functions locally using , ,  and so forth. The terminal sends only the completed form, consisting of all the data entered on the screen, to the receiving system when the user presses an key.

There is a distinction between the  and the  keys. In some multiple-mode terminals, that can switch between modes, pressing the key when &quot;not&quot; in block mode does not do the same thing as pressing the key. Whilst the key will cause an input line to be sent to the host in line-at-a-time mode, the key will rather cause the terminal to transmit the contents of the character row where the cursor is currently positioned to the host, host-issued prompts and all. Some block-mode terminals have both an and local cursor moving keys such as and .

Different computer operating systems require different degrees of mode support when terminals are used as computer terminals. The POSIX terminal interface, as provided by Unix and POSIX-compliant operating systems, does not accommodate block-mode terminals at all, and only rarely requires the terminal &quot;itself&quot; to be in line-at-a-time mode, since the operating system is required to provide canonical input mode, where the terminal device driver in the operating system &quot;emulates&quot; local echo in the terminal, and performs line editing functions at the host end. Most usually, and especially so that the host system can support non-canonical input mode, terminals for POSIX-compliant systems are always in character-at-a-time mode. In contrast, IBM 3270 terminals connected to MVS systems are always required to be in block mode.

<text>Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 – April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly &quot;Hour of Power&quot; television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the &quot;Hour of Power&quot; now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, California. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200.

Schuller began broadcasting his &quot;Hour of Power&quot; program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of &quot;Hour of Power&quot; shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The &quot;Hour of Power&quot; broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral.

Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 1990s, his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller&#x27;s weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world&#x27;s most widely watched hour-long church service ever.

== Early years ==
Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (née Beltman; 1891–1970) and Anthony Schuller (1882–1964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents&#x27; farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water.

In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family’s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain &quot;baptismal-gown.” Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: &quot;This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.&quot;

In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle, Henry Beltman, who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle&#x27;s prediction the &quot;single most defining moment of my early life.&quot; After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan.

Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree in 1950 from Western Theological Seminary, which taught in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California.

== Evolution of the Crystal Cathedral ==

In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the “Garden Grove Community Church.” As a result of not being able to secure any other suitable places to rent to start a church, Schuller decided to try out a relatively new concept in “church service presentation” known as the “Drive-in Church Model.“ His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a &quot;walk-in, drive-in&quot; church, serving both congregations.

 Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller&#x27;s second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller&#x27;s second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) &quot;Crystal Cathedral Church.&quot;

Seven years later in 1968 a &quot;Tower of Hope&quot; steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately ) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another to the structure&#x27;s overall height.

 Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure.

In order to meet the needs of the church&#x27;s ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as &quot;the largest glass building in the world.&quot; The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable &quot;Crystal Cathedral&quot; structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the &quot;Crystal Cathedral Ministries.&quot; Schuller&#x27;s Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million.

== Ministry ==

Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus &quot;met needs before touting creeds&quot;. Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, &quot;Sin is a condition before it is an action.&quot; Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, &quot;If you can dream it, you can do it!&quot;

As the Crystal Cathedral&#x27;s founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world&#x27;s most widely watched hour-long church service, the &quot;Hour of Power&quot;, 1,500 of which were recorded.

== Personal life ==
On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929–2014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the &quot;Hour of Power&quot; for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen.

== Retirement and succession ==
On January 22, 2006, Schuller&#x27;s son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited &quot;a lack of shared vision&quot; as the cause. Schuller stated that &quot;different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry&quot; with his son &quot;made it necessary ... to part ways in the &quot;Hour of Power&quot; television ministry&quot;. Schuller also said &quot;I love my son and am proud of my son&quot; and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. &quot;The real minister&#x27;s name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller&quot;, he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers.

On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church&#x27;s leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church&#x27;s board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010.

==Bobby Schuller as pastor of Shepherd&#x27;s Grove Church==

In the wake of Robert Schuller&#x27;s retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller&#x27;s grandson, Bobby V. Schuller, moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the much smaller Shepherd&#x27;s Grove church building in nearby Irvine, California. From 2013 to 2018, the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church in Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years, Schuller&#x27;s grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather&#x27;s &quot;Hour of Power&quot; weekly TV broadcast.

The Crystal Cathedral building and its campus were then sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange for use as its diocesan cathedral and offices. Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

==Final years and death==
On October 18, 2010, during the Great Recession in the United States, Sheila Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection.

In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, &quot;Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible&quot; and, &quot;I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.&quot;

On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry&#x27;s board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of &quot;a hostile work environment&quot;. The &quot;International Business Times&quot; reported that this came following &quot;a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family&quot;. According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged.

On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral&#x27;s board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller&#x27;s grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the &quot;Hour of Power&quot; television program as well as a non-voting member of the board.

In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians.

Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years.

Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015, at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California.

<doc id="249405" wikidata="Q397447" url="?curid=249405" title="Torc">
<text>A torc, also spelled torq or torque, is a large rigid or stiff neck ring in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together. The great majority are open at the front, although some have hook and ring closures and a few have mortice and tenon locking catches to close them. Many seem designed for near-permanent wear and would have been difficult to remove. 

Torcs have been found in Scythian, Illyrian, Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the European Iron Age from around the 8th century BC to the 3rd century AD. For Iron Age Celts, the gold torc seems to have been a key object. It identified the wearer, apparently usually female until the 3rd century BC, thereafter male, as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient Celtic art are torcs. Celtic torcs disappeared in the Migration Period, but during the Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces, mainly in silver, came back into fashion. Similar neck-rings are also part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods.

==Terminology and definition==
The word comes from Latin &quot;&quot; (or &quot;torques&quot;), from &quot;&quot;, &quot;to twist&quot;, because of the twisted shape many of the rings have. Typically, neck-rings that open at the front when worn are called &quot;torcs&quot; and those that open at the back &quot;collars&quot;. Smaller bracelets and armlets worn around the wrist or on the upper arm sometimes share very similar forms. Torcs were made from single or multiple intertwined metal rods, or &quot;ropes&quot; of twisted wire. Most of those that have been found are made from gold or bronze, less often silver, iron or other metals (gold, bronze and silver survive better than other metals when buried for long periods).

Elaborate examples, sometimes hollow, used a variety of techniques but complex decoration was usually begun by casting and then worked by further techniques. The Ipswich Hoard includes unfinished torcs that give clear evidence of the stages of work. Flat-ended terminals are called &quot;buffers&quot;, and in types like the &quot;fused-buffer&quot; shape, where what resemble two terminals are actually a single piece, the element is called a &quot;muff&quot;.

==Bronze Age Europe and Asia==
There are several types of rigid gold and sometimes bronze necklaces and collars of the later European Bronze Age, from around 1200 BC, many of which are classed as &quot;torcs&quot;. They are mostly twisted in various conformations, including the &quot;twisted ribbon&quot; type, where a thin strip of gold is twisted into a spiral. Other examples twist a bar with a square or X section, or just use round wire, with both types in the three 12th– or 11th-century BC specimens found at Tiers Cross, Pembrokeshire, Wales. The Milton Keynes Hoard contained two large examples of thicker rounded forms, as also used for bracelets. 
The terminals are not emphasized as in typical Iron Age torcs, though many can be closed by hooking the simple terminals together. Many of these &quot;torcs&quot; are too small to be worn round the neck of an adult, and were either worn as bracelets or armlets, or by children or statues. Archaeologists find dating many torcs difficult, with some believing torcs were retained for periods of centuries as heirlooms, and others believing there were two periods of production. Differing ratios of silver in the gold of other objects—typically up to 15% in the Bronze Age but up to 20% in the Iron Age—can help decide the question. There are several flared gold torcs with a C-shaped section in the huge Mooghaun North Hoard of Late Bronze Age gold from 800 to 700 BC found in County Clare in Ireland.

In parts of Asia, torcs appear in Scythian art from the Early Iron Age, and include &quot;classicizing&quot; decoration drawing on styles from the east. Torcs are also found in Thraco-Cimmerian art. Torcs are found in the Tolstaya burial and the Karagodeuashk kurgan (Kuban area), both dating to the 4th century BC. A torc is part of the Pereshchepina hoard dating to the 7th century AD. Thin torcs, often with animal head terminals, are found in the art of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, with some other elements derived from Scythian art.

==Celtic torcs==
Depictions of the gods and goddesses of Celtic mythology sometimes show them wearing or carrying torcs, as in images of the god Cernunnos wearing one torc around his neck, with torcs hanging from his antlers or held in his hand, as on the Gundestrup cauldron. This may represent the deity as the source of power and riches, as the torc was a sign of nobility and high social status. 

The famous Roman copy of the original Greek sculpture &quot;The Dying Gaul&quot; depicts a wounded Gaulish warrior naked except for a torc, which is how Polybius described the &quot;gaesatae&quot;, Celtic warriors from modern northern Italy or the Alps, fighting at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, although other Celts there were clothed. One of the earliest known depictions of a torc can be found on the Warrior of Hirschlanden (6th century BC), and a high proportion of the few Celtic statues of human figures, mostly male, show them wearing torcs.

Other possible functions that have been proposed for torcs include use as rattles in rituals or otherwise, as some have stones or metal pieces inside them, and representations of figures thought to be deities carrying torcs in their hand may depict this. Some are too heavy to wear for long, and may have been made to place on cult statues. Very few of these remain but they may well have been in wood and not survived. Torcs were clearly valuable, and often found broken in pieces, so being a store of value may have been an important part of their use. It has been noted that the Iberian gold examples seem to be made at fixed weights that are multiples of the Phoenician shekel.

With bracelets, torcs are &quot;the most important category of Celtic gold&quot;, though armlets and anklets were also worn; in contrast finger-rings were less common among the early Celts. The earliest Celtic torcs are mostly found buried with women, for example, the gold torc from the La Tène period chariot burial of a princess, found in the Waldalgesheim chariot burial in Germany, and others found in female graves at Vix in France (illustrated) and Reinheim. Another La Tène example was found as part of a hoard or ritual deposit buried near Erstfeld in Switzerland. It is thought by some authors that the torc was mostly an ornament for women until the late 3rd century BC, when it became an attribute of warriors. However, there is evidence for male wear in the early period; in a rich double burial of the Hallstatt period at Hochmichele, the man wears an iron torc and the female a necklace with beads. A heavy torc in silver over an iron core with bull&#x27;s head terminals, weighing over 6 kilos, from Trichtingen, Germany, probably dates to the 2nd century BC (illustrated).
Many finds of torcs, especially in groups and in association with other valuables but not associated with a burial, are clearly deliberate deposits whose function is unclear. They may have been ritual deposits or hidden for safekeeping in times of warfare. Some may represent the work-in-progress of a workshop. After the early period, torcs are especially prominent in the Celtic cultures reaching to a coast of the Atlantic, from modern Spain to Ireland, and on both sides of the English Channel.

Some very elaborately worked torcs with relief decoration in a late form of La Tène style have been found in Britain and Ireland, dating from roughly the 3rd to 1st centuries BC. There may be a connection with an older tradition in the British Isles of elaborate gold neckwear in the form of gold lunulas, which seem centred on Ireland in the Bronze Age, and later flat or curved wide collars; gold twisted ribbon torcs are found from both periods, but also imported styles such as the fused-buffer. The most elaborate late Insular torcs are thick and often hollow, some with terminals forming a ring or loop. The most famous English example is the 1st-century BC multi-stranded electrum Snettisham Torc found in northwestern Norfolk in England (illustrated), while the single hollow torc in the Broighter Gold hoard, with relief decoration all round the hoop, is the finest example of this type from Ireland, also 1st century BC. The Stirling Hoard, a rare find in Scotland of four gold torcs, two of them twisted ribbons, dating from the 3rd to 1st century BC, was discovered in September 2009. 
The Roman Titus Manlius in 361 BC challenged a Gaul to single combat, killed him, and then took his torc. Because he always wore it, he received the nickname &quot;Torquatus&quot; (the one who wears a torc), and it was adopted by his family. After this, Romans adopted the torc as a decoration for distinguished soldiers and elite units during Republican times. A few Roman torcs have been discovered. Pliny the Elder records that after a battle in 386 BC (long before his lifetime) the Romans recovered 183 torcs from the Celtic dead, and similar booty is mentioned by other authors.

It is not clear whether the Gallo-Roman &quot;Warrior of Vacheres&quot;, a sculpture of a soldier in Roman military dress, wears a torc as part of his Roman uniform or as a reflection of his Celtic background. Quintilian says that the Emperor Augustus was presented by Gauls with a gold torc weighing 100 Roman pounds (nearly ), far too heavy to wear. A torc from the 1st century BC Winchester Hoard, is broadly in Celtic style but uses the Roman technique of laced gold wire, suggesting it may have been a &quot;diplomatic gift&quot; from a Roman to a British tribal king.

A very late example of a torc used as ceremonial item in early Medieval Wales can be found in the writings of Gerald of Wales. The author wrote that there still existed a certain royal torc that had once been worn by Prince Cynog ap Brychan of Brycheiniog (fl. 492 AD) and was known as Saint Kynauc&#x27;s Collar. Gerald encountered and described this relic first-hand while travelling through Wales in 1188. Of it he says, &quot;it is most like to gold in weight, nature, and colour; it is in four pieces wrought round, joined together artificially, and clefted as it were in the middle, with a dog&#x27;s head, the teeth standing outward; it is esteemed by the inhabitants so powerful a relic, that no man dares swear falsely when it is laid before him.&quot; It is of course possible that this torc long pre-dated the reign of Prince Cynog and was a much earlier relic that had been recycled during the British Dark Ages to be used as a symbol of royal authority. It is now lost.

There are mentions in medieval compilations of Irish mythology; for example in the Lebor Gabála Érenn (11th century) Elatha wore 5 golden torcs when meeting Eriu.

===Romano-British beaded torcs===

After the Roman conquest of Britain, from about 75 AD for a century or more, a different type called the &quot;beaded torc&quot; appears in Roman Britain, mainly in the northern &quot;frontier&quot; region, in two types, A with separate &quot;beads&quot; and B made in one piece. These are in copper alloy rather than precious metal, and evidently more widely spread in society than the elite Iron Age Celtic examples.

==Shapes and decoration==
Most Achaemenid torcs are thin single round bars with matching animal heads as the terminals, facing each other at the front. Some Early Celtic forms depart from the normal style of torc by lacking a break at the throat, and instead are heavily decorated at the continuous front, with animal elements and short rows of &quot;balusters&quot;, rounded projections coming to a blunt point; these are seen both on the sculpted torc worn by the stone &quot;Glauberg Warrior&quot; and a gold torc (illustrated) found in the same oppidum. 

Later Celtic torcs nearly all return to having a break at the throat and strong emphasis on the two terminals. The Vix torc has two very finely made winged horses standing on fancy platforms projecting sideways just before the terminals, which are flattened balls under lions&#x27; feet. Like other elite Celtic pieces in the &quot;orientalizing&quot; style, the decoration shows Greek influence but not a classical style, and the piece may have been made by Greeks in the Celtic taste, or a &quot;Graeco-Etruscan workshop&quot;, or by Celts with foreign training.

Spiral ribbon torcs, usually with minimal terminals, continue a Bronze Age type and are found in the Stirling Hoard from Scotland, and elsewhere: &quot;Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive&quot;, perhaps indicating &quot;a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years&quot;. The terminals were often slightly flared plain round cylinders which were folded back to hook round each other to fasten the torc at the throat. Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned round bars, two or more bars twisted together, thin round rods (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire. A rarer type twists a single bar with an X profile.

Except in British looped terminals, the terminals of Iron Age torcs are usually formed separately. The &quot;buffer&quot; form of terminal was the most popular in finds from modern France and Germany, with some &quot;fused buffer&quot; types opening at the rear or sides. In both buffer types and those with projecting fringes of ornament, decoration in low relief often continues back round the hoop as far as the midpoint of the side view. In Iberian torcs thin gold bars are often wound round a core of base metal, with the rear section a single round section with a decorated surface.

The c. 150 torcs found in the lands of the Iberian Celts of Galicia favoured terminals ending in balls coming to a point or small buffer (&quot;pears&quot;), or a shape with a double moulding called &quot;scotiae&quot;. The pointed ball is also found in northern Italy, where the hoops often end by being turned back upon themselves so that the terminals face out to the sides, perhaps enabling closure by hooking round. Both of these mostly used plain round bars or thin rods wound round a core. In the terminals of British torcs loops or rings are common, and the main hoop may be two or more round bars twisted together, or several strands each made up of twisted wire. Decoration of the terminals in the finest examples is complex but all abstract. In these two types the hoop itself normally has no extra decoration, though the large torc in the Irish Broighter Gold hoard is decorated all round the hoop, the only Irish example decorated in this way.

<text>Holiday Inn is a 1942 American musical film starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, with Marjorie Reynolds, Virginia Dale, and Walter Abel. It was directed by Mark Sandrich with music by Irving Berlin. The composer wrote twelve songs specifically for the film, the best known being &quot;White Christmas&quot;. The film features a complete reuse of the song &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, written by Berlin for the 1933 Broadway revue &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; and used as a highlight of the 1948 film &quot;Easter Parade,&quot; starring Astaire and Judy Garland. The film&#x27;s choreography was by Danny Dare.

The film received a 1943 Academy Award for Best Original Song (Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;), as well as Academy Award nominations for Best Score (Robert Emmett Dolan) and Best Original Story (Irving Berlin).

==Plot==

Jim Hardy, Ted Hanover, and Lila Dixon have a popular New York City song and dance act. On Christmas Eve, Jim prepares for his final performance before marrying Lila and retiring on a farm in Connecticut. Lila tells Jim she has fallen in love with the notorious charmer Ted instead; heartbroken, Jim bids them goodbye.

He tries to make a go of working the farm, but ends up in a sanatorium instead. The following Christmas Eve, Jim is back in New York City with plans to turn his farm into &quot;Holiday Inn,&quot; an entertainment venue open only on holidays, to the amusement of Ted and his agent Danny Reed. In a flower shop, Danny is pitched by sales girl and aspiring performer Linda Mason; he steers her to Holiday Inn and Ted&#x27;s club. Later that night, Linda and Jim accidentally meet at a performance by Ted and Lila. Jim pretends to own a rival club, while Linda postures as a celebrity friend of Ted&#x27;s, only to flee when Ted and Lila approach.

On Christmas Day, Linda arrives at Holiday Inn and meets Jim, the pair immediately realizing their deception. Jim sings her his new song, &quot;White Christmas&quot;.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Holiday Inn opens to a packed house. Back in New York City, Ted learns that Lila is leaving him for a Texas millionaire. Drinking heavily, he arrives at Holiday Inn at midnight and literally stumbles into Linda. They dance and bring down the house, which believes it all to be a polished act. Danny arrives and is ecstatic that Ted has found a new partner, but in the morning, Ted does not remember Linda. Jim hides her, afraid Ted will steal her away.

On Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday, Ted and Danny search for Linda, but Jim convinces Linda to play the minstrel show number &quot;Abraham&quot; in blackface together to foil them. While applying Linda&#x27;s makeup, Jim asks her to stay there with him between holidays, which she interprets as a proposal. He affirms it but equivocates that only when he can afford to. Leaving empty-handed, Ted and Danny plan to return.

Rehearsing for Valentine&#x27;s Day, Jim presents Linda with a new song, &quot;Be Careful, It&#x27;s My Heart&quot;. Ted arrives and launches into an impromptu dance with Linda. Recognizing her from New Year&#x27;s Eve, he demands that Jim prepare them a number to perform in the next show.

On Washington&#x27;s Birthday, Ted and Linda dance in elaborate 18th-century period costumes, with Jim sabotaging their tempo from a minuet to jazz throughout. Linda refuses Ted&#x27;s offer to become his dance partner, saying that she and Jim are to be married. When Ted asks him about the engagement, Jim plays it off, but Ted is unconvinced.

At Easter, romance blossoms between Jim and Linda. They are met by Ted, who asks to remain in Jim&#x27;s shows to experience &quot;the true happiness&quot; they have found. Linda is charmed, but Jim is suspicious.

Jim&#x27;s apprehensions are confirmed on Independence Day, when he overhears Ted and Danny&#x27;s bringing a pair of Hollywood representatives to audition Ted and Linda for motion pictures from that night&#x27;s show. Jim bribes teamster Gus to stall Linda, who ends up driving the pair into a creek. Linda gets picked up on the roadside by Lila. Having left the penniless &quot;millionaire&quot;, she crows that she will be Ted&#x27;s partner that night for the studio tryout. Assuming that Jim made the switch to keep her from leaving, Linda directs Lila into the creek.

At the inn, Ted is forced to improvise a solo, a fireworks-studded tap dance routine. Linda arrives, irritated that Jim did not trust her to make her own decision. She joins Ted, Hollywood-bound. Jim reluctantly agrees to let the eager producers make a film about Holiday Inn, but vows not to leave the Inn.

Thanksgiving finds the Inn closed, and Jim wallowing in self-pity. As he prepares to mail his new song, his housekeeper Mamie implores him to fight to win Linda back.

Jim arrives in California on Christmas Eve, just as Ted and Linda plan to marry. Jim confronts Ted in his dressing room, gets locked in, then turns the table on Ted and Danny. On the set of Linda&#x27;s movie, a meticulous recreation of Holiday Inn, Jim leaves his pipe on the piano and hides as Linda enters and performs &quot;White Christmas&quot;. Reflexively ringing tiny bells with it as he did, she falters, then continues waveringly as Jim&#x27;s voice joins her. Jim appears and Linda runs to him.

Back at Holiday Inn on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Ted is reunited with Lila. Jim and Linda sing a duet, affirming their love.

==Cast==
==Production==
In May 1940, Irving Berlin signed an exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures to write songs for a musical film based on his idea of an inn that opened only on public holidays. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were the stars of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; with support from Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale. Filming took place between November 18, 1941, and January 30, 1942. Produced and directed by Mark Sandrich, &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; had its premiere at the New York City Paramount Theatre August 4, 1942. It was a success in the US and the UK, the highest-grossing film musical to that time. It was expected that &quot;Be Careful, It&#x27;s My Heart&quot; would be the hit song. While it did very well, &quot;White Christmas&quot; topped the charts in October 1942 instead, and stayed there for eleven weeks. Another Berlin song, &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;, is featured over the opening credits and within the film storyline.

Filming outside the studio occurred at the Village Inn Resort in Monte Rio on the Russian River, in Sonoma County, California.

Many segments of the film are preceded by shots of a calendar with a visual symbol of the given holiday. For November, an animated turkey is shown running back and forth between the third and fourth Thursdays, finally shrugging its shoulders in confusion. This is a satirical reference to the &quot;Franksgiving&quot; controversy created when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to expand the Christmas shopping season by declaring Thanksgiving a week earlier than before, leading to Congress setting Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November by law.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii occurred halfway through filming. As a result, the Fourth of July segment was expanded beyond Fred Astaire&#x27;s firecracker dance to include the patriotic number that highlights the strength of the US military.

==Music==
===&quot;White Christmas&quot;===

The song that would become &quot;White Christmas&quot; was conceived by Berlin on the set of the film &quot;Top Hat&quot; in 1935. He hummed the melody to Astaire and the film&#x27;s director Mark Sandrich as a song possibility for a future Astaire-Ginger Rogers vehicle. Astaire loved the tune, but Sandrich passed on it. Berlin&#x27;s assignment for Paramount was to write a song about each of the major holidays of the year. He found that writing a song about Christmas was the most challenging, due to his Jewish upbringing. When Crosby first heard Berlin play &quot;White Christmas&quot; in 1941 at the first rehearsals, he did not immediately recognize its full potential. Crosby simply said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we have any problems with that one, Irving.&quot;

Although &quot;White Christmas&quot; has become iconic, this was not the original intention. The song &quot;Be Careful, It&#x27;s My Heart&quot;, played during the Valentine&#x27;s Day section of the film, was originally intended to be a bigger hit when production of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; commenced.

The song is used during the Christmas holiday sections of the movie, most notably when it is introduced to Linda Mason (Reynolds) by Jim Hardy (Crosby) while she is trying to obtain a position in the shows at the inn. Hardy begins playing the song to her allowing her to join him and eventually perform solo. The song is also reprised near the end of the movie. Chrysotile asbestos was used to make the fake snow used in this scene.

===Song releases===
Full-length studio recordings of the film&#x27;s songs, differing slightly from those in the movie, were made for commercial release. Initially issued on 78rpm records, they were later collected on LP, cassette and CD.

===Soundtrack===

&quot;Soundtrack from Holiday Inn&quot; is a soundtrack album of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire singing Irving Berlin songs that were taken directly from &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;. This soundtrack was first released on vinyl LP. These songs differ slightly and are often faster to save time than the ones released to the public on 78 rpm phonograph records.

It was not until 1979, 37 years after the making of the film, that a full soundtrack was released on Sunbeam Records (STK-112) of the songs in the movie.

In 2004, the Soundtrack Factory label released a soundtrack of the original recordings taken directly from the movie. Martha Mears performed Marjorie Reynolds&#x27; singing in the movie, so it is she who is performing on this recording as well. All songs sung by Bing Crosby unless stated. The track list is:

# Main Title: Overture
# I&#x27;ll Capture Your Heart Singing (with Fred Astaire &amp; Virginia Dale)
# Lazy
# You&#x27;re Easy to Dance With (Fred Astaire)
# White Christmas (with Marjorie Reynolds)
# Happy Holiday (with Marjorie Reynolds)
# Let&#x27;s Start the New Year Right
# Abraham (with Marjorie Reynolds &amp; Louise Beavers)
# Be Careful, It&#x27;s My Heart
# I Can&#x27;t Tell a Lie (Fred Astaire)

# &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; movie trailer (audio only - bonus track)

==Home media==

&quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was first released on VHS and Beta formats in September 1981 by MCA Home Video, re-released in 1986 and again, on VHS only, in 1992.

It was first released on DVD paired with another Crosby vehicle, &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944). It added a trailer for each film and some text-based extras. This version is also available in many boxed set collections of holiday-themed or Crosby-themed movies.

In 2006, it was released as a single-disc &quot;Special Edition&quot; featuring a commentary by Ken Barnes, with interspersed archival comments by Crosby and Astaire. It also included &quot;A Couple of Song and Dance Men&quot;, a documentary on Astaire and Crosby; &quot;All-Singing All-Dancing&quot;, a featurette on audio recording of movie musicals; and a reissue theatrical trailer.

In 2008, it was released as a three-disc &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; containing the previous DVD and a second disc with a newly computer-colorized version and &quot;Coloring a Classic&quot;, a featurette on the colorization. Also included was a CD of the 12-track &quot;Song Hits from Holiday Inn&quot; album, featuring original full-length studio recordings of the film&#x27;s songs.

In 2014, it was released on Blu-ray as a single disc edition featuring both black and white and colorized versions and all previous DVD extras.

In 2017, it was released again on both formats, this time including a second disc featuring a performance of the 2016 Broadway adaptation.

==Reception==
The film ranked No. 6 in the list of top-grossing movies for 1942 in the US.

Theodore Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;all very easy and graceful; it never tries too hard to dazzle; even in the rousing and topical Fourth of July number, it never commits a breach of taste by violently waving the flag. Instead, it has skipped back over the year in an affectionate and light-hearted spirit.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a winner all the way&quot; with &quot;sterling&quot; performances by the male leads. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a most delightful entertainment... The performances of the leading players are very good.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; described it as &quot;a completely satisfying musical filled with crisp comedy, fetching music, snappy dance routines, first-rate acting, smart story touches, and lavish and beautiful settings&quot;.

==Legacy==
The success of the song &quot;White Christmas&quot; eventually led to another film based on the song, &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), which starred Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen. It was an extremely loose remake of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, with a plot again involving an inn, but otherwise different from the earlier film. Fred Astaire was offered the second lead in the new film, but after reading the script, he declined. The role was then offered to Donald O&#x27;Connor, but he was injured before filming began. Danny Kaye ultimately took the role.

In 2004, the American Film Institute listed &quot;White Christmas&quot; at No. 5 in its 100 Years...100 Songs.

A colorized version of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was released by Universal on October 14, 2008. The colorization was done by Legend Films, which used Edith Head’s sketch artist, Jan Muckelstone, as a color design consultant for costume authenticity.

The name of the Holiday Inn hotel chain was inspired by the film. The title of the film also inspired the 1946 renaming of a small 19th century inn in Intervale, New Hampshire. By right of precedence its owners were able to bar any other use of the name in that area of New Hampshire until they chose to relinquish it.

=== Blackface controversy ===
Beginning in the 1980s, some broadcasts of the film have entirely omitted the &quot;Abraham&quot; musical number, staged at the Inn for Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday, because of its depiction of a blackface minstrel show incorporating racist images and behaviors. However, because Turner Classic Movies airs films uncut and unedited, the network has left the &quot;Abraham&quot; number intact during their screenings of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;. AMC also aired the film intact before it became an advertiser-supported channel. To avoid advertiser objections, the edited version now airs annually on AMC.

In 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May named &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; as her favorite Christmas film, causing controversy due to the blackface performance in the &quot;Abraham&quot; segment.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the January 11, 1943, CBS broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, starring Crosby and Astaire with Dinah Shore. On December 15, 1952, &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; presented a half-hour adaption of the film. The episode starred Gordon MacRae and Dorothy Warenskjold.

In 2013, Universal Stage Productions, the live theater division of Universal Pictures, invited Goodspeed Musicals to develop a stage adaptation of the film. With book by Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge, music from the films &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot; (since Paramount Global through Paramount Pictures now remains and currently owns the rights for the 1954 adaptation of White Christmas) plus other Berlin songs, and directed by Greenberg, the musical premiered at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut on September 19, 2014. The Roundabout Theatre Company production of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; began previews on Broadway at Studio 54 on September 1, 2016, before the official opening on October 6. The cast included Bryce Pinkham as Jim, Megan Lawrence as Louise, Corbin Bleu as Ted, and Lee Wilkof as Danny.

<text>Cynognathus is an extinct genus of large-bodied cynodontian therapsids that lived in the Middle Triassic. It is known from a single species, Cynognathus crateronotus. &quot;Cynognathus&quot; was a predator closely related to mammals and had a southern hemispheric distribution. Fossils have so far been recovered from South Africa, Argentina, Antarctica, and Namibia.

== Description ==

&quot;Cynognathus&quot; was a heavily built animal, and measured around in snout-to-vent body length and up to in total length. It had a particularly large head, up to in length, with wide jaws and sharp teeth. Its hindlimbs were placed directly beneath the body. There has been controversy about whether the forelimbs were also held upright or sprawled outwards in a reptilian fashion, but recent studies suggest cynodonts typically held their front legs in a posture between these two extremes. A study of living mammals concluded that &quot;upright posture&quot; in mammals is a myth based on the posture of mammal species specialized for fast running, such as dogs, hares, and antelopes; modern mammals that are not specialized for running often hold their forelimbs in a semi-sprawled posture.

Possible autapomorphies of &quot;C. crateronotus&quot; include an extremely elongated postorbital bar and sectorial postcanine teeth with two serrated cusps distal to a recurved apex.

== Discovery and naming ==

During 1888 and 1889, the British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley visited southern Africa. In 1889, near Lady Frere, at a location where earlier Alfred Brown had discovered a tooth, Seeley excavated a skull and partial postcranial skeleton of a cynodontian. In 1894, Seeley named the genus &quot;Cynognathus&quot; with as type species &quot;Cynognathus crateronotus&quot;. Simultaneously, he named three other species in the genus: &quot;Cynognathus berryi&quot;, honouring James Berry who had assisted in the excavations, &quot;Cynognathus platyceps&quot;, the &quot;flat jaw&quot;, and &quot;Cynognathus leptorhinus&quot;, the &quot;slender nose&quot;. The generic name &quot;Cynognathus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;kyon&quot; and &quot;gnathos&quot;, meaning &quot;dog jaw&quot;. In 1895, Seeley published a more comprehensive description of these finds.

Fossil material probably belonging to the genus has been given several different names over the years. Generic synonyms include &quot;Cynidiognathus&quot;, &quot;Cynogomphius&quot;, &quot;Karoomys&quot;, &quot;Lycaenognathus&quot;, &quot;Lycochampsa&quot; and &quot;Lycognathus&quot;. Opinions vary as to whether all remains belong to the same species. The genus &quot;Karoomys&quot; is known only from a tiny juvenile. Species-level synonyms of &quot;Cynognathus crateronotus&quot; include &quot;Cynidiognathus broomi&quot;, &quot;Cynidiognathus longiceps&quot;, &quot;Cynidiognathus merenskyi&quot;, &quot;Cynognathus berryi&quot;, &quot;Cynognathus minor&quot;, &quot;Cynognathus platyceps&quot;, &quot;Cynogomphius berryi&quot;, &quot;Karoomys browni&quot;, &quot;Lycaenognathus platyceps&quot;, &quot;Lycochampsa ferox&quot;, &quot;Lycognathus ferox&quot;, and &quot;Nythosaurus browni&quot;.

== Distribution ==

Fossils have been found in the Karoo, the Puesto Viejo Formation, Fremouw Formation, in South Africa/Lesotho, Argentina and Antarctica.

&quot;Cynognathus&quot; lived between the Anisian and the Ladinian (Middle Triassic).

This genus forms a &quot;Cynognathus Assemblage Zone&quot; in the Beaufort Group of the Karoo Supergroup.

== Classification ==
Seeley in 1894/1895 placed &quot;Cynognathus&quot; in a separate family Cynognathidae, within the Cynodontia. &quot;Cynognathus&quot; is presently the only recognized member of the family Cynognathidae. Later a clade Cynognathia was named after the genus, within the Eucynodontia.

&quot;Cynognathus crateronotus&quot; in a cladogram after Stefanello &quot;et al&quot;. (2023):

== Paleobiology ==

In the Karoo Basin in what is now South Africa, &quot;Cynognathus&quot; lived in open environments with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters, similar to today&#x27;s Western Cape region but more arid. Individuals grew rapidly and continuously. Their hunting habits were largely unaffected by the changing seasons. The dentary was equipped with differentiated teeth, with fangs in the front for seizing prey and wider teeth in the rear of the jaw suitable for cutting meat; these show this animal could effectively process its food before swallowing. The presence of a secondary palate in the mouth indicates that &quot;Cynognathus&quot; would have been able to breathe and swallow simultaneously. All these adaptations are consistent with maintaining a regular, high basal metabolic rate (&quot;warm-blooded&quot;), as in modern mammals.

The possible lack of belly ribs, in the stomach region, suggests the presence of an efficient diaphragm, an important muscle that allows mammals to breathe equally well when they are walking, running, or holding still. Pits and canals on the bone of the snout indicate concentrations of nerves and blood vessels. In mammals, these structures support special sensory hairs (whiskers), so it is likely &quot;Cynognathus&quot; had whiskers as well.

<text>Mary G. Harris Jones (1837 (baptized) – November 30, 1930), known as Mother Jones from 1897 onward, was an Irish-born American labor organizer, former schoolteacher, and dressmaker who became a prominent union organizer, community organizer, and activist. She helped coordinate major strikes, secure bans on child labor, and co-founded the Labor unionist trade union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

After Jones&#x27;s husband and four children all died of yellow fever in 1867 and her dress shop was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, she became an organizer for the Knights of Labor and the United Mine Workers union. In 1902, she was called &quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot; for her success in organizing miners and their families against the mine owners. In 1903, to protest the lax enforcement of the child labor laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a children&#x27;s march from Philadelphia to the home of President Theodore Roosevelt in New York.

==Early life==

Mary G. Harris was born on the north side of Cork, the daughter of Catholic tenant farmers Richard Harris and Ellen (née Cotter) Harris. Her exact date of birth is uncertain; she was baptized on August 1, 1837. Harris and her family were victims of the Great Famine, as were many other Irish families. The famine drove more than a million families, including the Harrises, to immigrate to North America, as Harris&#x27;s family did when Harris was 10.

==Formative years==
Mary was a teenager when her family immigrated to Canada. In Canada (and later in the United States), the Harris family were victims of discrimination due to their immigrant status as well as their Catholic faith and Irish heritage. Mary received an education in Toronto at the Toronto Normal School, which was tuition-free and even paid a stipend to each student of one dollar per week for every semester completed. Mary did not graduate from the Toronto Normal School, but she was able to undergo enough training to take a teaching position at a convent in Monroe, Michigan, on August 31, 1859 at the age of 23. She was paid eight dollars per month, but the school was described as a &quot;depressing place&quot;. After tiring of her assumed profession, she moved first to Chicago and then to Memphis, where in 1861 she married George E. Jones, a member and organizer of the National Union of Iron Moulders, which later became the International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America, which represented workers who specialized in building and repairing steam engines, mills, and other manufactured goods. Considering that Mary&#x27;s husband was providing enough income to support the household, she altered her labor to housekeeping.

In 1867, Jones lost her husband and their four children, three girls and a boy all under the age of five, during a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis. After that loss, she returned to Chicago to open another dressmaking business. She did work for members of Chicago&#x27;s upper class in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1871, four years after the death of her family, Jones lost her home, shop, and possessions in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Jones, like many others, helped rebuild the city. According to her autobiography, this led to her joining the Knights of Labor. 
Jones started organizing strikes. At first the strikes and protests failed, sometimes ending with police shooting at and killing protesters. Most members of the Knights were men, and by the middle of the 1870s, member numbers leaped to more than a million, becoming the largest labor organization in the United States. The Haymarket Affair of 1886 and the fear of anarchism and social change incited by union organizations resulted in the demise of the Knights of Labor when an unknown person threw a bomb into an altercation between the Chicago police and workers on strike. Once the Knights ceased to exist, Mary Jones became involved mainly with the United Mine Workers (UMW). She frequently led UMW strikers in picketing and encouraged striking workers to stay on strike when management brought in strike-breakers and militias. She believed that &quot;working men deserved a wage that would allow women to stay home to care for their kids.&quot; Around this time, strikes were getting better organized and started to produce greater results, such as better pay for the workers.

Active as an organizer and educator in strikes nationwide, she was involved particularly with the UMW and the Socialist Party of America. As a union organizer, she gained prominence for organizing the wives and children of striking workers in demonstrations on their behalf. She was termed &quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot; by a West Virginian district attorney, Reese Blizzard, in 1902 at her trial for ignoring an injunction banning meetings by striking miners. &quot;There sits the most dangerous woman in America&quot;, announced Blizzard. &quot;She comes into a state where peace and prosperity reign... crooks her finger, [and] twenty thousand contented men lay down their tools and walk out.&quot;

Jones was ideologically separated from many female activists of her day due to her lack of commitment to the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage. She was quoted as saying that &quot;you don&#x27;t need the vote to raise hell!&quot; She opposed many of the activists because she believed it was more important to advocate for the working class than to advocate for women. When some suffragists accused her of being anti-women&#x27;s rights, she replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not an anti to anything which brings freedom to my class.&quot; 

Jones was known as a charismatic and effective speaker throughout her career. Occasionally she would include props, visual aids, and dramatic stunts in her speeches. Her talks usually involved the relating of some personal tale in which she invariably &quot;showed up&quot; one form of authority or another. Mother Jones reportedly spoke in a pleasant-sounding brogue that projected well. When she grew excited, her voice dropped in pitch.

By age 60, Jones had assumed the persona of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; by claiming to be older than she was, wearing outdated black dresses, and referring to the male workers that she helped as &quot;her boys.&quot; The first reference to her in print as &quot;Mother Jones&quot; was in 1897.

==&quot;March of the Mill Children&quot;==
In 1901, workers in Pennsylvania&#x27;s silk mills went on strike. Many of them were young girls demanding to be paid adult wages. The 1900 census had revealed that one sixth of American children under the age of sixteen were employed. John Mitchell, the president of the UMWA, brought Mother Jones to northeastern Pennsylvania in the months of February and September to encourage unity among striking workers. To do so, she encouraged the wives of the workers to organize into a group that would wield brooms, beat on tin pans, and shout &quot;join the union!&quot; She felt that wives had an important role to play as the nurturers and motivators of the striking men, but not as fellow workers. She claimed that the young girls working in the mills were being robbed and demoralized. She felt that the rich were denying these children the right to go to school in order to be able to pay for their own children&#x27;s college tuitions.

To enforce worker solidarity, Jones traveled to the silk mills in New Jersey and returned to Pennsylvania to report that the conditions she observed there were much better. She stated that &quot;the child labor law is better enforced for one thing and there are more men at work than seen in the mills here.&quot; In response to the strike, mill owners claimed that if the workers insisted on a wage scale, they would not be able to do business while paying adult wages and would be forced to close. Jones encouraged the workers to accept a settlement. Although she agreed to a settlement that sent the young girls back to the mills, she continued to fight child labor for the rest of her life.

In 1903, Jones organized children who were working in mills and mines to participate in her famous &quot;March of the Mill Children&quot;, a 125-mile trek from Kensington, Philadelphia, to the summer house (and Summer White House) of President Theodore Roosevelt on Long Island (in Oyster Bay, New York). They had banners demanding &quot;We want to go to school and not the mines!&quot; and held rallies each night in a new town on the way with music, skits, and speeches drawing thousands of citizens.

As Mother Jones noted, many of the children at union headquarters were missing fingers and had other disabilities, and she attempted to get newspaper publicity for the bad conditions experienced by children working in Pennsylvania. However, the mill owners held stock in most newspapers. When the newspapermen informed her that they could not publish the facts about child labor because of this, she remarked &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got stock in these little children and I&#x27;ll arrange a little publicity.&quot; Permission to see President Roosevelt was denied by his secretary, and it was suggested that Jones address a letter to the president requesting a visit with him. Mother Jones wrote a letter requesting a meeting, but never received an answer. Though the president refused to meet with the marchers, the incident brought the issue of child labor to the forefront of the public agenda. The 2003 non-fiction book &quot;Kids on Strike!&quot; described Jones&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Crusade in detail.

== Activism and criminal charges ==
During the Paint Creek–Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, Mary Jones arrived in June 1912, speaking and organizing despite a shooting war between United Mine Workers members and the private army of the mine owners. Martial law in the area was declared and rescinded twice before Jones was arrested on February 13, 1913, and brought before a military court. Accused of conspiring to commit murder among other charges, she refused to recognize the legitimacy of her court-martial. She was sentenced to twenty years in the state penitentiary. During house arrest at Mrs. Carney&#x27;s Boarding House, she acquired a dangerous case of pneumonia.

Jones was released after 85 days of confinement, and her release coincided with Indiana Senator John W. Kern&#x27;s initiation of a Senate investigation into the conditions in the local coal mines. Mary Lee Settle describes Jones at this time in her 1978 novel &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;. Several months later, she helped organize coal miners in Colorado in the 1913–14 United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company, in what is known as the Colorado Coalfield War. Once again she was arrested, serving time in prison and inside the San Rafael Hospital, and was escorted from the state in the months prior to the Ludlow Massacre. After the massacre, she was invited to meet with the owner of the Ludlow mine, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The meeting was partially responsible for Rockefeller&#x27;s 1915 visit to the Colorado mines and introduction of long-sought reforms.

In 1917, Mother Jones played a role in the Bloomington Streetcar Strike.

Mother Jones attempted to stop miners from marching into Logan County, West Virginia, in late August 1921. Mother Jones also visited the governor and departed assured he would intervene. Jones opposed the armed march, appeared on the line of march and told them to go home. In her hand, she claimed to have a telegram from President Warren Harding offering to work to end the private police in West Virginia if they returned home. When UMW president Frank Keeney demanded to see the telegram, Mother Jones refused and he denounced her as a &#x27;fake&#x27;. Because she refused to show anyone the telegram, and the President&#x27;s secretary denied ever having sent one, she was suspected of having fabricated the story. After she fled the camp, she reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown.

Mother Jones was joined by Keeney and other UMWA officials who were also pressuring the miners to go home.

==Later years==
 Jones remained a union organizer for the UMW into the 1920s and continued to speak on union affairs almost until she died. She released her own account of her experiences in the labor movement as &quot;The Autobiography of Mother Jones&quot; (1925). Although Mother Jones organized for decades on behalf of the UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as &#x27;medieval&#x27;, the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Ephraim F. Morgan for defending the First Amendment freedom of the weekly labor publication &quot;The Federationist&quot; to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners&#x27; request that he ban the paper demonstrated to Mother Jones that he &#x27;refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type, I wish to pay my respects&#x27;. 

During her later years, Jones lived with her friends Walter and Lillie May Burgess on their farm in what is now Adelphi, Maryland. She celebrated her self-proclaimed 100th birthday there on May 1, 1930, and was filmed making a statement for a newsreel.

==Death==
Mary Harris Jones died on November 30, 1930, at the Burgess farm, then in Silver Spring, Maryland, now part of Adelphi. There was a funeral Mass at St. Gabriel&#x27;s Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.

Jones is buried in the Union Miners Cemetery in Mount Olive, Illinois, alongside miners who died in the 1898 Battle of Virden. She called these miners, killed in strike-related violence, &quot;her boys.&quot; In 1932, about 15,000 Illinois mine workers gathered in Mount Olive to protest against the United Mine Workers, which soon became the Progressive Mine Workers of America. Convinced that they had acted in the spirit of Mother Jones, the miners decided to place a proper headstone on her grave. By 1936, the miners had saved up more than $16,000 and were able to purchase &quot;eighty tons of Minnesota pink granite, with bronze statues of two miners flanking a twenty-foot shaft featuring a bas-relief of Mother Jones at its center.&quot; On October 11, 1936, also known as Miners&#x27; Day, an estimated 50,000 people arrived at Mother Jones&#x27;s grave to see the new gravestone and memorial. Since then, October 11 is not only known as Miners&#x27; Day but is also referred to and celebrated in Mount Olive as &quot;Mother Jones&#x27;s Day.&quot;

The farm where she died began to advertise itself as the &quot;Mother Jones Rest Home&quot; in 1932, before being sold to a Baptist church in 1956. The site is now marked with a Maryland Historical Trust marker, and a nearby elementary school is named in her honor.

==Legacy==

In 1930, Mother Jones said the following regarding her legacy: &quot;I am considered a Bolshevik, and a Red and an I.W.W., and a radical, and I admit to being all they&#x27;ve charged me with. I&#x27;m anything that would change monied civilization to a higher and grander civilization for the ages to come. And I long to see the day when labor will have the destination of the nation in her own hands, and she will stand a united force, and show the world what workers can do.&quot;

Mother Jones remained a well-known symbol for the American labor movement after her death and remains an important symbol for the power of organized labor among activists and organizers, both in the United States and globally.
* Jones&#x27; words are still invoked by union supporters more than a century later: &quot;Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living.&quot; Already known as &quot;the miners&#x27; angel&quot; when she was denounced on the floor of the United States Senate as the &quot;grandmother of all agitators&quot;, she replied, &quot;I hope to live long enough to be the great-grandmother of all agitators.&quot;
* &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine was established in the 1970s and quickly became &quot;the largest selling radical magazine of the decade.&quot;
* In 1984, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.
* During the bitter 1989–90 Pittston Coal strike in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, the wives and daughters of striking coal miners, inspired by the still-surviving tales of Jones&#x27;s legendary work among an earlier generation of the region&#x27;s coal miners, dubbed themselves the &quot;Daughters of Mother Jones&quot;. They played a crucial role on the picket lines and in presenting the miners&#x27; case to the press and public.
* The Mother Jones Award was granted from 1996 to 2009, though skipping some years, by the Working Women’s History Project and its predecessor, the Women and Labor History Project.
* To coincide with International Women&#x27;s Day on March 8, 2010 a proposal from Councillor Ted Tynan for a plaque to be erected in Mary Harris Jones&#x27;s native Cork City was passed by the Cork City Council. Members of the Cork Mother Jones Commemorative Committee unveiled the plaque on August 1, 2012 to mark the 175th anniversary of her birth. The Cork Mother Jones Festival was also held in 2012 in the Shandon area of the city, close to her birthplace, with numerous guest speakers. The festival now takes place annually around the anniversary and has led to growing awareness of Mother Jones&#x27;s legacy and links between admirers in Ireland and the US. A new documentary, &quot;Mother Jones and Her Children&quot;, has been produced by Cork-based Frameworks Films and premiered at the Cork festival in 2014.
* In 2019, Mother Jones was inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame.

<doc id="249415" wikidata="Q1439379" url="?curid=249415" title="Tintern Abbey">
<text>Tintern Abbey ( ) was founded on 9 May 1131 by Walter de Clare, Lord of Chepstow. It is situated adjacent to the village of Tintern in Monmouthshire, on the Welsh bank of the River Wye, which at this location forms the border between Monmouthshire in Wales and Gloucestershire in England. It was the first Cistercian foundation in Wales, and only the second in Britain (after Waverley Abbey).

The abbey fell into ruin after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Its remains have been celebrated in poetry and painting from the 18th century onwards. In 1984, Cadw took over responsibility for managing the site. Tintern Abbey is visited by approximately 70,000 people every year.

==History==
===Earliest history===
The Monmouthshire writer Fred Hando records the tradition of Tewdrig, King of Glywysing who retired to a hermitage above the river at Tintern. He then emerged to lead his son&#x27;s army to victory against the Saxons at Pont-y-Saeson, a battle in which he was killed.

===Cistercian foundations===

The Cistercian Order was founded in 1098 at the abbey of Cîteaux. A breakaway faction of the Benedictines, the Cistercians sought to re-establish observance of the Rule of Saint Benedict. Considered the strictest of the monastic orders, they laid down requirements for the construction of their abbeys, stipulating that &quot;none of our houses is to be built in cities, in castles or villages; but in places remote from the conversation of men. Let there be no towers of stone for bells, nor of wood of an immoderate height, which are unsuited to the simplicity of the order&quot;. The Cistercians also developed an approach to the Benedictine requirement for a dual commitment to pray and work that saw the evolving of a dual community, the monks and the lay brothers, illiterate workers who contributed to the life of the abbey and to the worship of God through manual labour. The order proved exceptionally successful and by 1151, five hundred Cistercian houses had been founded in Europe. The &quot;Carta Caritatis&quot; (Charter of Love) laid out their basic principles, of obedience, poverty, chastity, silence, prayer, and work. With this austere way of life, the Cistercians were one of the most successful orders in the 12th and 13th centuries. The lands of the Abbey were divided into agricultural units or granges, on which local people worked and provided services such as smithies to the Abbey.

William Giffard, Bishop of Winchester introduced the first colony of Cistercian monks to England at Waverley, Surrey, in 1128. His first cousin, Walter de Clare, of the powerful family of Clare, established the second Cistercian house in Britain, and the first in Wales, at Tintern in 1131. The Tintern monks came from a daughter house of Cîteaux, L&#x27;Aumône Abbey, in the diocese of Chartres in France. In time, Tintern established two daughter houses, Kingswood in Gloucestershire (1139) and Tintern Parva, west of Wexford in southeast Ireland (1203).

===First and second abbeys: 1131–1536===
The present-day remains of Tintern are a mixture of building works covering a 400-year period between 1131 and 1536. Very little of the first buildings still survives today; a few sections of walling are incorporated into later buildings and the two recessed cupboards for books on the east of the cloisters are from this period. The church of that time was smaller than the present building, and slightly to the north.

The Abbey was mostly rebuilt during the 13th century, starting with the cloisters and domestic ranges, and finally the great church between 1269 and 1301. The first mass in the rebuilt presbytery was recorded to have taken place in 1288, and the building was consecrated in 1301, although building work continued for several decades. Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, the then lord of Chepstow, was a generous benefactor; his monumental undertaking was the rebuilding of the church. The earl&#x27;s coat of arms was included in the glasswork of the Abbey&#x27;s east window in recognition of his contribution.

It is this great Decorated Gothic abbey church that can be seen today, representing the architectural developments of its period; it has a cruciform plan with an aisled nave, two chapels in each transept, and a square-ended aisled chancel. The abbey is built of Old Red Sandstone, with colours varying from purple to buff and grey. Its total length from east to west is 228 feet, while the transept is 150 feet in length.

King Edward II stayed at Tintern for two nights in 1326. When the Black Death swept the country in 1349, it became impossible to attract new recruits for the lay brotherhood; during this period, the granges were more likely to be tenanted out than worked by lay brothers, evidence of Tintern&#x27;s labour shortage. In the early 15th century, Tintern was short of money, due in part to the effects of the Welsh uprising under Owain Glyndŵr against the English kings, when abbey properties were destroyed by the Welsh. The closest battle to Tintern Abbey was at Craig-y-dorth near Monmouth, between Trellech and Mitchel Troy.

===Dissolution and ruin===
In the reign of Henry VIII, the Dissolution of the Monasteries ended monastic life in England, Wales and Ireland. On 3 September 1536, Abbot Wych surrendered Tintern Abbey and all its estates to the King&#x27;s visitors and ended a way of life that had lasted 400 years. Valuables from the Abbey were sent to the royal Treasury and Abbot Wych was pensioned off. The building was granted to the then lord of Chepstow, Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester. Lead from the roof was sold and the decay of the buildings began.

==Architecture and description==


===Church===
The west front of the church, with its seven-light decorated window, was completed around 1300.

===Nave===
The nave is of six bays, and originally had arcades to both the northern and southern sides.

===Monks&#x27; choir and presbytery===
The presbytery is of four bays, with a great east window, originally of eight lights. Almost all of the tracery is gone, with the exception of the central column and the mullion above.

===Cloister===
The cloister retains its original width, but its length was extended in the 13th century rebuilding, creating a near square.

===Book room and sacristy===
The book room parallels the sacristy and both were created at the very end of the construction period of the second abbey, around 1300.

===Chapter house===
The chapter house was the place for daily gatherings of the monks, to discuss non-religious abbey business, make confession and listen to a reading from the Book of Rules.

===Monks&#x27; dormitory and latrine===
The monks&#x27; dormitory occupied almost the entirety of the upper storey of the east range. The latrines were double-storeyed, with access both from the dormitory and from the day-room below.

===Refectory===
The refectory dates from the early 13th century, and is a replacement for an earlier hall.

===Kitchen===
Little of the kitchen, which served both the monks&#x27; refectory, and the lay brothers&#x27; dining hall, remains.

===Lay brothers&#x27; dormitory===
The dormitory was sited above the lay brothers&#x27; refectory but has been completely destroyed.

===Infirmary===
The infirmary, 107 ft long and 54 ft wide, housed both sick and elderly monks in cubicles in the aisles. The cubicles were originally open to the hall but were enclosed in the 15th century when each recess was provided with a fireplace.

===Abbot&#x27;s residence===
The abbot&#x27;s lodgings date from two periods, its origins in the early 13th century, and with a major expansion in the late 14th century.

==Industry==

Following the Abbey&#x27;s dissolution, the adjacent area became industrialised with the setting-up of the first wireworks by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works in 1568 and the later expansion of factories and furnaces up the Angidy valley. Charcoal was made in the woods to feed these operations and, in addition, the hillside above was quarried for the making of lime at a kiln in constant operation for some two centuries. The Abbey site was in consequence subject to a degree of pollution and the ruins themselves were inhabited by the local workers. J.T.Barber, for example, remarked on &quot;passing the works of an iron foundry and a train of miserable cottages engrafted on the offices of the Abbey&quot; on his approach.

Not all visitors to the Abbey ruins were shocked by the intrusion of industry, however. Joseph Cottle and Robert Southey set out to view the ironworks at midnight on their 1795 tour, while others painted or sketched them during the following years. A 1799 print of the Abbey by Edward Dayes includes the boat landing near the ruins with the square-sailed local cargo vessel known as a trow drawn up there. On the bank is some of the encroaching housing, while in the background above are the cliffs of a lime quarry and smoke rising from the kiln. Though Philip James de Loutherbourg&#x27;s 1805 painting of the ruins does not include the intrusive buildings commented on by others, it makes their inhabitants and animals a prominent feature. Even William Havell&#x27;s panorama of the valley from the south pictures smoke rising in the distance (see Gallery), much as Wordsworth had noted five years before &quot;wreathes of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees&quot; in his description of the scene.

==Tourism==
===18th and 19th centuries===
By the mid-18th century it became fashionable to visit &quot;wilder&quot; parts of the country. The Wye Valley in particular was well known for its romantic and picturesque qualities and the ivy-clad Abbey was frequented by tourists. One of the earliest prints of the Abbey had been in the series of engravings of historical sites made in 1732 by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck. Their sets of views, however, catered to antiquarian interests and often were a means to flatter the landowners involved and so gain orders for their publications. Tourism as such developed in the following decades. The &quot;Wye Tour&quot; is claimed to have had its beginning after Dr John Egerton began taking friends on trips down the valley in a specially constructed boat from his rectory at Ross-on-Wye and continued doing so for a number of years. Rev. Dr. Sneyd Davies&#x27; short verse epistle, &quot;Describing a Voyage to Tintern Abbey, in Monmouthshire, from Whitminster in Gloucestershire&quot;, was published in 1745, the year Egerton took possession of his benefice. But that journey was made in the opposite direction, sailing from the Gloucestershire shore across the River Severn to Chepstow and then ascending the Wye.

Among subsequent visitors was Francis Grose, who included the Abbey in his &quot;Antiquities of England and Wales&quot;, begun in 1772 and supplemented with more illustrations from 1783. In his description he noted how the ruins were being tidied for the benefit of tourists: &quot;The fragments of its once sculptured roof, and other remains of its fallen decorations, are piled up with more regularity than taste on each side of the grand aisle.&quot; There they remained for the next century and more, as is evident from the watercolours of J. M. W. Turner (1794), the prints of Francis Calvert (1815) and the photographs of Roger Fenton (1858). Grose further complained that the site was too well tended and lacked &quot;that gloomy solemnity so essential to religious ruins&quot;.

Another visitor during the 1770s was the Rev. William Gilpin, who later published a record of his tour in &quot;Observations on the River Wye&quot; (1782), devoting several pages to the Abbey as well as including his own sketches of both a near and a far view of the ruins. Though he too noted the same points as had Grose, and despite also the presence of the impoverished residents and their desolate dwellings, he found the Abbey nevertheless &quot;a very inchanting piece of ruin&quot;. Gilpin&#x27;s book helped increase the popularity of the already established Wye tour and gave travellers the aesthetic tools by which to interpret their experience. It also encouraged &quot;its associated activities of amateur sketching and painting&quot; and the writing of other travel journals of such tours. Initially Gilpin&#x27;s book was associated with his theory of the Picturesque, but later some of this was modified by another editor so that, as Thomas Dudley Fosbroke’s &quot;Gilpin on the Wye&quot; (1818), the account of the tour could function as the standard guidebook for much of the new century.

Meanwhile, other more focussed works aimed at the tourist were available by now. They included Charles Heath’s &quot;Descriptive Accounts of Tintern Abbey&quot;, first published in 1793, which was sold at the Abbey itself and in nearby towns. This grew into an evolving project that ran through eleven editions until 1828 and, as well as keeping abreast of the latest travel information, was also a collection of historical and literary materials descriptive of the building. Later there appeared &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Illustrated Guide to the Banks of the Wye&quot;, published from Chepstow in 1854 and often reprinted. The work of local bookseller Robert Taylor, it was aimed at arriving tourists and also available eventually at the Abbey. Much the same information as in that work appeared later as the 8-page digest, &quot;An Hour at Tintern Abbey&quot; (1870, 1891), by John Taylor.
Until the early 19th century, the local roads were rough and dangerous and the easiest access to the site was by boat. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, while trying to reach Tintern from Chepstow on a tour with friends in 1795, almost rode his horse over the edge of a quarry when they became lost in the dark. It was not until 1829 that the new Wye Valley turnpike was completed, cutting through the abbey precinct. In 1876 the Wye Valley Railway opened a station for Tintern. Although the line itself crossed the river before reaching the village, a branch was built from it to the wireworks, obstructing the view of the Abbey on the road approach from the north.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1901, Tintern Abbey was bought by the Crown from the Duke of Beaufort for £15,000 and the site was acknowledged as a monument of national importance. Although there had been some repair work done in the ruins as a result of the 18th-century growth of tourism, it was not until now that archaeological investigation began and informed maintenance work was carried out on the Abbey. In 1914, responsibility for the ruins was passed to the Office of Works, who undertook major structural repairs and partial reconstructions (including removal of the ivy considered so romantic by the early tourists). In 1984, Cadw took over responsibility for the site, which was Grade I listed from 29 September 2000. The arch of the Abbey&#x27;s watergate, which led from the Abbey to the River Wye, was Grade II listed from the same date.

==In the visual arts==
Evidence of the growth of interest in the Abbey and the visitors attracted to it is provided by the number of painters who arrived to record aspects of the site. The painters Francis Towne (1777), Thomas Gainsborough (1782), Thomas Girtin (1793), and J. M. W. Turner in the 1794–95 series now at the Tate and the British Museum, depicted details of the Abbey&#x27;s stonework. So did Samuel Palmer (see Gallery) and Thomas Creswick in the 19th century, as well as amateurs such as the father and daughter named Ellis who made a watercolour study of the refectory windows in the second half of the century (see Gallery). About that period too, the former painter turned photographer, Roger Fenton, applied this new art not only to detailing a later stage in the decay of the building, but used the quality of light to emphasise it.

Visiting artists also focused on the effects of light and atmospheric conditions. Charles Heath, in his 1806 guide to the abbey, had commented on the &quot;inimitable&quot; effect of the harvest moon shining through the main window. Other moonlit depictions of the abbey include John Warwick Smith’s earlier 1779 scene of the ruins from across the river and Peter van Lerberghe’s interior of 1812, with its tourist guides carrying burning torches, which shows the abbey interior lit both by these and by moonlight. Once the railway had arrived in the vicinity, steam excursions were organised in the 1880s to Tintern station so as to view the harvest moon through the rose window.

Earlier in the century, the light effects made possible by transparencies (a forerunner of the modern photographic negative) had been deployed to underline such aspects of the picturesque. Among those described in the novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814) as decorating its heroine’s sitting room, one was of Tintern Abbey. The function of the transparencies was to reproduce light effects, such as “fire light, moon light, and other glowing illusions”, created by painting areas of colour on the back of a commercial engraving and adding varnish to make specific areas translucent when suspended in front of a light source. Since the Abbey was one of the buildings recommended for viewing by moonlight, it is possible that this was the subject of the one in Fanny&#x27;s room. In fact, a tinted print of the period such as those used for creating transparencies already existed in &quot;Ibbetson&#x27;s Picturesque Guide to Bath, Bristol &amp;c&quot;, in which the full moon is featured as seen through an arch of the east wing.

Different light effects appear in the work of other painters, such as the sunsets by Samuel Palmer and Benjamin Williams Leader, and the colour study by Turner in which the distant building appears as a &quot;dark shape at the centre&quot; beneath slanting sunlight (see Gallery).

===Hybrid works===
Prints of historical buildings along the Wye increased during the fourth quarter of the 18th century, with interior views and details of the Abbey&#x27;s stonework among them. Two later sets of these were distinguished by including a selection of unattributed verses. First came four tinted prints that mixed both distant and interior views of the building, published by Frederick Calvert in 1815. The other was an anonymous set of views, with the same verses printed below. These were published by the London firm of Rock &amp; Co. and later pasted on pages of an album in the King&#x27;s Library.

One set of verses hails the Abbey&#x27;s survival, despite Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution, &quot;Where thou in gothic grandeur reign’st alone&quot;. The phrase &quot;gothic grandeur&quot; derives from John Cunningham’s &quot;An elegy on a pile of ruins”&quot; (1761), an excerpt from which was published by Grose at the end of his description of Tintern Abbey. At that period the adjective was used as a synonym for &quot;mediaeval&quot; and was so applied by Grose when describing the Abbey as being &quot;of that stile of architecture called gothic&quot;. Cunningham&#x27;s poem was a melancholy contemplation of the ravages of time that spoke in general terms without naming a specific building. But the verses on the print are more positive in feeling; in celebrating the Abbey&#x27;s historical persistence, they do not see ruin as necessarily a cause for regret. The scenes below which the verses appear are also quite different from each other. Calvert&#x27;s view is across the river from the opposite bank of the Wye, while the Rock print is close up to the ruins with the river in the background.
Tintern is not specifically named in the verses mentioned above, although it is in two other sets and their poetic form overall is consistent: paired quatrains with pentameter lines rhymed alternately. One set begins &quot;Yes, sacred Tintern, since thy earliest age,&quot; and King Henry is again represented as being foiled in his intention, but this time by no &quot;earthly king&quot;. The Abbey&#x27;s roof is now &quot;of Heaven’s all glorious blue&quot; and its pillars &quot;foliaged… in vivid hue&quot;. Here Calvert&#x27;s interior view looks past the ivy-grown pillars to the south window. The Rock view that these lines accompany is of that same window, surrounded by ivy and viewed from the exterior. Another set of verses begins &quot;Thee! venerable Tintern, thee I hail&quot;, and celebrates the Abbey&#x27;s setting. An appeal to Classical standards of beauty is made by calling the Wye by its Latin name of Vaga and referring to the serenading nightingale as Philomel. Naturally the river features in both prints, but where Calvert&#x27;s is the south-east view from the high ground behind the Abbey, with the Wye flowing past it to the right, the Rock view is from across the river, looking up to the high ground.

The remaining print by Calvert is another view of the interior in which a small figure in the foreground points down to a heap of masonry there, while the Rock print corresponds to Calvert&#x27;s view of the south window. The accompanying stanzas deal with the transient nature of fame. Beginning “Proud man! Stop here, survey yon fallen stone”, their emotional tone is a melancholy at odds with the buoyant message of the other verses. It is uncertain whether all eight stanzas were originally from the same poem on the subject of the Abbey and what the relationship was between poet and artist.

J. M. W. Turner had been accompanying his work with poetical extracts from 1798, but it was not a widespread practice. However, the appearance of the title &quot;A Series of Sonnets Written Expressly to Accompany Some Recently-Published Views of Tintern Abbey&quot;, dating from 1816, the year after the appearance of Calvert&#x27;s portfolio, suggests another contemporary marriage between literary and artistic responses to the ruins. But while the main focus in Calvert&#x27;s &quot;Four Coloured Engravings&quot; is the pictures, in a later hybrid work combining verse and illustration it is the text. Louisa Anne Meredith’s &quot;Tintern Abbey in four sonnets&quot; appeared in the 1835 volume of her &quot;Poems&quot;, prefaced by the reproduction of the author&#x27;s own sketch of the ivy-covered north transept. This supplements in particular the description in the third sonnet: 
&lt;poem&gt;
:::::::Th’ivy’s foliage twined
::The air-hung arch – the column‘s lofty height, 
::Wreathing fantastically round the light
::And traceried shaft.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Poetry===
A dedicatory letter at the start of Gilpin&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the river Wye&quot; is addressed to the poet William Mason and mentions a similar tour made in 1771 by the poet Thomas Gray. Neither of those dedicated a poem to the Abbey, but the place was soon to appear in topographical works in verse. Among the earliest was the 1784 six-canto &quot;Chepstow; or, A new guide to gentlemen and ladies whose curiosity leads them to visit Chepstow: Piercefield-walks, Tintern-abbey, and the beautiful romantic banks of the Wye, from Tintern to Chepstow by water&quot; by the Rev. Edward Davies (1719–89). Furnished with many historical and topical discursions, the poem included a description of the method of iron-making in the passage devoted to Tintern, which was later to be included in two guide books, the most popular of which was successive editions of Charles Heath&#x27;s. Then in 1825 it was followed by yet another long poem, annotated and in four books, by Edward Collins: &quot;Tintern Abbey or the Beauties of Piercefield&quot; (Chepstow, 1825).

The Abbey also featured in poems arising from the Wye tour, such as the already mentioned account of his voyage by Rev. Sneyd Davies, in which the ruins are briefly reflected on at its end. It is that element of personal response that largely distinguishes such poems from verse documentaries of the sort written by Edward Davies and Edward Collins. For example, the gap between the ideal and the actual is what Thomas Warwick noted, looking upstream to the ruins of Tintern Abbey and downstream to those of Chepstow Castle, in a sonnet written at nearby Piercefield House. Edward Jerningham&#x27;s short lyric, &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot;, written in 1796, commented on the lamentable lesson of the past, appealing to Gilpin&#x27;s observations as his point of reference. Fosbroke&#x27;s later adaptation of that work is likewise recommended as a supplement to Arthur St John&#x27;s more voluminous description in the account of his own tour along the river in 1819, &quot;The Weft of the Wye&quot;.
Contemplation of the past reminded the Rev. Luke Booker of his personal mortality in an &quot;Original sonnet composed on leaving Tintern Abbey and proceeding with a party of friends down the River Wye to Chepstow&quot;; inspired by his journey, he hopes to sail as peacefully at death to the &quot;eternal Ocean&quot;. And Edmund Gardner (1752?–1798), with his own death imminent, similarly concluded in his &quot;Sonnet Written in Tintern Abbey&quot;, that &quot;Man’s but a temple of a shorter date&quot;. William Wordsworth’s different reflections followed a tour on foot that he made along the river in 1798, although he does not actually mention the ruins in his &quot;Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey&quot;. Instead, he recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory. Later Robert Bloomfield made his own tour of the area with friends, recording the experience in a journal and in his long poem, &quot;The Banks of the Wye&quot; (1811). However, since the timetable of the boat-trip downstream was constrained by the necessity of the tide, the Abbey was only given brief attention as one of many items on the way.

Aspects of the building&#x27;s past were treated at much greater length in two more poems. George Richards&#x27; ode, &quot;Tintern Abbey; or the Wandering Minstrel&quot;, was probably written near the end of the 18th century. It opens with a description of the site as it used to be, seen from outside; then a minstrel arrives, celebrating the holy building in his song as a place of loving nurture, of grace and healing. The other work, &quot;The Legend of Tintern Abbey&quot;, is claimed as having been &quot;written on the Banks of the Wye&quot; by Edwin Paxton Hood, who quotes it in his historical work, &quot;Old England&quot;. An 11-stanza poem in rolling anapaestic metre, it relates how Walter de Clare had murdered his wife and built the Abbey in penitence. Closing on an evocation of the ruins by moonlight, the work was later reprinted in successive editions of &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Illustrated Guide&quot; over the following decades.

Louisa Anne Meredith used the occasion of her visit to reimagine the past in a series of linked sonnets that allowed her to pass backwards from the present-day remains, beautified by the mantling vegetation, to bygone scenes, &quot;Calling them back to life from darkness and decay&quot;. For Henrietta F. Vallé, &quot;Seeing a lily of the valley blooming among the ruins of Tintern&quot; was sufficient to mediate the pious sentiments of a former devotee there. As she noted, &quot;it must ever awaken mental reflection to see beauty blossoming among decay&quot;.

But the religious strife of the following decades forbade such a sympathetic response and made a new battleground of the ruins. &quot;Tintern Abbey: a Poem&quot; (1854) was, according to its author, Frederick Bolingbroke Ribbans (1800–1883), &quot;occasioned by a smart retort given to certain Romish priests who expressed the hope of soon recovering their ecclesiastical tenure of it&quot;. He prefers to see the building in its present decay than return to the time of its flourishing, &quot;when thou wast with falsehood fill’d&quot;. Martin Tupper too, in his sonnet &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot; (1858), exhorts his readers to &quot;Look on these ruins in a spirit of praise&quot;, insofar as they represent &quot;Emancipation for the Soul&quot; from superstition.

Only a few years earlier, in his 1840 sonnet on the Abbey, Richard Monckton Milnes had deplored the religious philistinism which had &quot;wreckt this noble argosy of faith&quot;. He concluded, as had Louisa Anne Meredith&#x27;s sonnets and the verses accompanying Calvert&#x27;s prints, that the ruin&#x27;s natural beautification signified divine intervention, &quot;Masking with good that ill which cannot be undone&quot;. In the wake of the Protestant backlash since then, Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley was constrained to allow, in the three sonnets he devoted to the Abbey, that after &quot;Men cramped the truth&quot; the building&#x27;s subsequent ruin had followed as a judgment. However, its renewed, melodic blossoming now stands as a reproach to Tupper&#x27;s brand of pietism too: &quot;Man, fretful with the Bible on his knee,/ Has need of such sweet musicker as thee!&quot;

In the 20th century two American poets returned to Wordsworth&#x27;s evocation of the landscape as the launching pad for their personal visions. John Gould Fletcher’s &quot;Elegy on Tintern Abbey&quot; answered the Romantic poet&#x27;s optimism with a denunciation of subsequent industrialisation and its ultimate outcome in the social and material destructiveness of World War I. Following a visit some thirty years later, Allen Ginsberg took lysergic acid near there on 29 July 1967 and afterwards wrote his poem &quot;Wales Visitation&quot; as a result. By way of &quot;the silent thought of Wordsworth in eld Stillness&quot; he beholds &quot;clouds passing through skeleton arches of Tintern Abbey&quot; and from that focus goes on to experience oneness with valleyed Wales.

===Fiction===
In 1816, the abbey was made the backdrop to Sophia Ziegenhirt&#x27;s three-volume novel of Gothic horror, &quot;The Orphan of Tintern Abbey&quot;, which begins with a description of the Abbey as seen on a sailing tour down the Wye from Ross to Chepstow. Her work was dismissed by &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; as &quot;of the most ordinary class, in which the construction of the sentences and that of the story are equally confused&quot;.

During the 20th century the genre switched to supernatural fiction, starting with &quot;The Ghost of Tintern Abbey&quot; (1901) by Mrs (Harriet Margaret Anne) Arthur Traherne, which is the means of discovering a murder. It was followed by &quot;The Troubled Spirit of Tintern Abbey&quot;, a story privately printed in 1910 under the initials &#x27;E. B.&#x27; which was later included in &quot;Lord Halifax’s Ghost Book&quot; (1936). There an Anglican cleric and his wife are on a cycling tour in the Wye valley and are contacted by a ghost from Purgatory who persuades them to have masses said for his soul. Later came Henry Gardner&#x27;s novella, &quot;The Ghost of Tintern Abbey&quot;, in 1984.

The more recent novel, Gordon Master&#x27;s &quot;The Secrets of Tintern Abbey&quot; (2008), covers the building&#x27;s mediaeval history as the author dramatises the turbulent 400 years of the Cistercian community up to the monastery&#x27;s dissolution.

<text>Chepstow () is a town and community in Monmouthshire, Wales, adjoining the border with Gloucestershire, England. It is located on the tidal River Wye, about above its confluence with the River Severn, and adjoining the western end of the Severn Bridge. It is the easternmost settlement in Wales, situated east of Newport, east-northeast of Cardiff, northwest of Bristol and west of London.

Chepstow Castle, situated on a clifftop above the Wye and the old bridge, is often cited as the oldest surviving stone castle in Britain. The castle was established by William FitzOsbern immediately after the Norman conquest, and was extended in later centuries before becoming ruined after the Civil War. A Benedictine priory was also established within the walled town, which was the centre of the Marcher lordship of Striguil. The port of Chepstow became noted in the Middle Ages for its imports of wine, and also became a major centre for the export of timber and bark, from nearby woodland in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. In the late eighteenth century the town was a focus of early tourism as part of the &quot;Wye Tour&quot;, and the tourist industry remains important. Other important industries included shipbuilding – one of the First World War National Shipyards was established in the town – and heavy engineering, including the prefabrication of bridges and wind turbine towers. Chepstow is also well known for its racecourse, which has hosted the Welsh National each year since 1949.

The town had a population of 12,350 at the 2011 census, decreasing to 11,900 (rounded to the nearest 100) at the 2021 census. It is served by the M48 motorway, and its accessibility to the cities of Bristol, Newport and Cardiff means it has a large number of commuters. It is administered as part of Monmouthshire County Council, and is within the Monmouth UK parliamentary constituency and Senedd constituency. Chepstow is on the western bank of the Wye, while adjoining villages on the eastern bank of the river, Tutshill and Sedbury, are in England. The population of the built-up area including these villages was 15,600 in 2021.

==Etymology==
The name Chepstow derives from the Old English &quot;ceap/chepe stowe&quot;, meaning market place or trading centre. The word &quot;stow&quot; usually denotes a place of special significance, and the root &quot;chep&quot; is the same as that in other placenames such as Chipping Sodbury and Cheapside. The name is first recorded in 1307, but may have been used by the English in earlier centuries. However, the name used by the Normans for the castle and lordship was Striguil (in various spellings, such as Estrighoiel), probably derived from a Welsh word &quot;ystraigyl&quot;, meaning a bend in the river. The Welsh name &quot;Cas-gwent&quot; refers to the &quot;castle of Gwent&quot;. The name Gwent itself derives from the Roman settlement &quot;Venta Silurum&quot; or &#x27;Market of the Silures&#x27;, now named Caerwent, west of Chepstow, which had been the Romano-British commercial centre of south-east Wales.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The earliest recorded evidence of human activity in the Chepstow area are charcoal deposits, found in St Peter&#x27;s Cave, at the base of Hardwick Cliff, Bulwark, dating from the Upper Paleolithic.

The oldest site of known habitation at Chepstow is at Thornwell, overlooking the estuaries of the Wye and Severn close to the modern M48 motorway junction, where archaeological investigations in advance of recent housing development revealed continuous human occupation from the Mesolithic period of around 5000 BC until the end of the Roman period, about 400 AD. There are also Iron Age fortified camps in the area, dating from the time of the Silures, at Bulwark, south of the town centre, and at Piercefield and Lancaut, some to the north. During the Roman occupation, there was a bridge or causeway across the Wye, about upstream of the later town bridge. Chepstow is located at a crossing point directly between the Roman towns at Gloucester (&quot;Glevum&quot;) and Caerwent (&quot;Venta Silurum&quot;). Although historians think it likely that there was a small Roman fort in the area, the only evidence found so far has been of Roman material and burials, rather than buildings.

After the Romans left, Chepstow was within the southern part of the Welsh kingdom of Gwent, known as &quot;Gwent Is-coed&quot; (i.e. &quot;Gwent this side of the woods&quot;). To the north of the modern town centre, a small church was established dedicated to St. Cynfarch (alternatively Cynmarch, Kynemark or Kingsmark), a disciple of St. Dyfrig. This later became an Augustinian priory on what is now Kingsmark Lane, but no traces of it remain. The town is close to the southern point of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, which begins on the east bank of the Wye at Sedbury and runs all the way to the Irish Sea in north Wales. This was built in the late 8th century as a boundary between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms, although some recent research has questioned whether the stretch near Chepstow formed part of the original Dyke. It is possible, though not clearly substantiated, that Chepstow may have superseded Caerwent as a trading centre, and been used by both Saxons and the Welsh. The Lancaut and Beachley peninsulas, opposite Chepstow, were in Welsh rather than Mercian control at that time, although by the time of the Domesday Book Striguil was assessed as part of Gloucestershire.

===The Normans===

After the Norman conquest of England, Chepstow was a key location. It was at the lowest bridging point of the River Wye, provided a base from which to advance Norman control into south Wales, and controlled river access to Hereford and the Marches. Chepstow Castle was founded by William fitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford, in 1067, and its Great Tower, often cited as the oldest surviving stone fortification in Britain, dates from that time or shortly afterwards. Its site, with sheer cliffs on one side and a natural valley on the other, afforded an excellent defensive location. A Benedictine priory, now St Mary&#x27;s Church, was also established nearby. This was the centre of a small religious community, the remains of which are buried under the adjoining car park. Monks, originally from Cormeilles Abbey in Normandy, were there until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The castle was expanded by William Marshal in the late twelfth century and, a century later, by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk. Bigod was also responsible for establishing a weekly market and annual fair, in the town which had grown up on the slopes between the castle and priory, and for building the Port Wall around it shortly after 1274. A toll gate controlled entry to the market area; this Town Gate was rebuilt in the 16th century. The town faced some hostile attacks from the Welsh to the west, but after the 14th century the castle&#x27;s importance diminished. The port of Chepstow developed during the mediaeval period, one reason being that its control by a Marcher Lord, rather than by the King, meant that it was exempt from English taxation. It mainly traded in timber and bark from the Wye Valley, and with Bristol. From mediaeval times, Chepstow was the largest port in Wales; its ships sailed as far as Iceland and Turkey, as well as to France and Portugal, and the town was known for its imports of wine.
===Later history===
Chepstow was given its first charter in 1524, by Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, and became part of Monmouthshire when the county was formed. The town appears as &quot;Strigulia&quot;, &quot;Chepstowe&quot; and &quot;Castelh Gwent&quot; on the Cambriae Typus map of 1573. The castle and town changed hands several times during the English Civil War, and the regicide Henry Marten was later imprisoned and died in the castle. The port continued to flourish; during the period 1790 to 1795, records show a greater tonnage of goods handled than Swansea, Cardiff and Newport combined. Chepstow reached the peak of its importance during the Napoleonic Wars, when its exports of timber, for ships, and bark, for leather tanning, were especially vital. There were also exports of wire and paper, made in the many mills on the tributaries of the Wye.

An important aspect of Chepstow&#x27;s trade was entrepôt trade: bringing larger cargoes into the manageable deep water of the Wye on high tide and breaking down the load for on-shipment in the many trows up the Wye to Hereford past the coin stamping mill at Redbrook, or up the Severn to Gloucester and beyond. Chepstow also traded across the estuary to Bristol on suitable tides to work vessels up and down the Avon to that city&#x27;s centre. Many buildings in the town remain from the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the elegant cast iron bridge across the Wye was opened in 1816 to replace an earlier wooden structure.

The town became an important centre for tourism from the late eighteenth century, when the &quot;Wye Tour&quot; became popular. Visitors regularly took boats from Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth down the river, visiting, drawing and painting the &quot;picturesque&quot; views of the area, which included those of Tintern Abbey, Piercefield House, and the ruined Chepstow Castle.

In the 19th century a shipbuilding industry developed, and the town was also known for the production of clocks, bells, and grindstones. In 1840 leaders of the Chartist insurrection in Newport were transported from Chepstow to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The port&#x27;s trade declined after the early 19th century, as Cardiff, Newport and Swansea became more suitable for handling the bulk export of coal and steel from the Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire valleys. However, shipbuilding was briefly revived when the National Shipyard No.1 was established during the First World War and for a short period afterwards, when the first prefabricated ships, including the &quot;War Glory&quot;, were constructed there. The influx of labour for the shipyards, from 1917, led to the start of &quot;garden suburb&quot; housing development at Hardwick (now known locally as &quot;Garden City&quot;) and Bulwark. The shipyard itself became a works for fabricating major engineering structures. From 1938, Chepstow housed the head office of the Red &amp; White bus company, on Bulwark Road.

New housing development in the twentieth century took place to the north and south of the town centre, and more recently beyond the A466 road to the west of the town. The town developed rapidly after the opening of the Severn Bridge in 1966, which replaced the car ferry between Beachley and Aust and allowed easier commuting between Chepstow and larger centres including Bristol and Cardiff. Over £2 million was invested in regenerating the town centre in 2004–05. This scheme, which includes sculptures and other public art, encountered some local criticism over its high cost, but gained several national awards reflecting its high design quality. The area beside the river has also been landscaped in association with a flood defence scheme.

==Geography==

Chepstow is located on the west bank of the River Wye, some north of its confluence with the Severn estuary. To the north of the town, the Wye passes through a limestone gorge, and there are limestone cliffs at Chepstow both north and south of the town centre and on the opposite (east) side of the river. The town is overlooked by the inland cliffs at Wyndcliff near St Arvans, about north of the town, and, from parts of the town, the Severn estuary and its bridges can be seen. The historic centre of Chepstow occupies part of a bend in the River Wye, and slopes up from the river to the town centre and beyond. As well as cliffs used for rock climbing, percolation of acidic groundwater has dissolved limestone to produce caves in the area, including Otter Hole, one of the most decorated cave systems in Britain, which runs under the racecourse. The climate of the town is affected by its position close to the Severn estuary.

The bedrock of Chepstow is limestone, mudstone and sandstone, overlain in places with some gravels and the clay and silt of the river&#x27;s tidal flats, which are of marine origin and up to two million years old. Most of the rock was produced in a warm, tropical marine environment, when Europe was closer to the equator. The rock of Sedbury cliffs and those under Chepstow Castle are Carboniferous Limestone, hundreds of metres thick in the area, made of particles and shells of sea creatures from 330 to 360 million years ago. Layered outcrops of darker Black Rock Limestone, which makes up a broad part of Chepstow&#x27;s bedrock, are very clear in cliffs along Craig yr Afon, part of the Wales Coast Path extending from Wye Crescent, and by the link road from Bulwark Road to the M48, where the looser reddish Mercia Mudstone (which extends under Bulwark and Sedbury and forms the cliffs at the Severn) and the lighter Hunts Bay limestone are also seen.

The River Wye at Chepstow has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. The river was established as a boundary between England and Wales by Athelstan in 928. However, after the Norman conquest, areas east of the Wye, within the former Saxon royal manor of Tidenham and including Beachley, Tutshill, Sedbury and Tidenham Chase, were included within the lordship of Striguil or Chepstow. In 1536, the river was confirmed as the boundary between Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire. Since the early 19th century, housing development has continued on the east bank of the river opposite Chepstow, at Tutshill and Sedbury. Those areas, though located in England rather than Wales, are now effectively suburbs of the town.

==Governance==
Chepstow is administered by Monmouthshire County Council, one of the 22 unitary local authorities in Wales formed in 1996. As of 2022, the town elects six county councillors, for the wards of Bulwark and Thornwell (2 members); Chepstow Castle and Larkfield (2 members); Mount Pleasant; and St Kingsmark. Following the 2022 local elections, the councillors are four from the Labour party, and two Conservative. The town also has its own Town Council, comprising 15 councillors elected every four years. The council elects a Town Mayor from among its number each year. The Town Mayor for 2022/23 is Cllr Margaret Griffiths.

Chepstow was an electoral ward to Gwent County Council between 1973 and 1996. Its first councillor, Barney O&#x27;Neill, became leader of the council in 1974.

Chepstow was granted a town charter in 1524 by its Marcher Lord, Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester. After the county of Monmouth was formed, Chepstow was included within the Hundred of Caldicot in 1542. A Corporation of bailiffs and burgesses controlled the town until the time of Charles II, when its charter lapsed, apparently as a result of a dispute. The town came under the control of a Local Board from 1864, and an urban district council was formed in 1894. Chepstow Urban District Council was abolished in 1974, when many of its functions were taken over by the new Monmouth District Council. This was renamed Monmouth Borough Council in 1988, and formed one of the five districts of Gwent until both authorities were abolished in 1996.

The town&#x27;s representation in Parliament was as part of the county of Monmouth seat, from 1536. Between 1885 and 1918 it formed part of the South Monmouthshire constituency, and since then has been within the Monmouth county constituency. The town has remained within the Monmouth constituency in subsequent elections, although the constituency boundary has changed several times. The constituency has returned a Conservative MP at most recent elections; the current member is David Davies, first elected in 2005. In elections for the Senedd, the town is part of the Monmouth constituency; the current MS is Peter Fox (Conservative). Until January 2020 Chepstow was within the Wales constituency for the European Parliament.

The Laws in Wales Acts created an anomaly in that, although Monmouthshire was noted as being in the &#x27;Country or Dominion of Wales&#x27;, it was made directly responsible to the courts of Westminster rather than falling under the Court of Great Sessions in Wales. Most legislation for Wales was applied to it using the phrase &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;, and the issue of whether Monmouthshire should be considered as part of Wales for administrative purposes was finally clarified in law by the Local Government Act 1972 which incorporated it within Wales.

==Economy==
Chepstow developed from mediaeval times as a port and trading centre. Its port functions, together with its shipbuilding industry, have now virtually ceased. The industries which developed on the shipyard sites, particularly the fabrication of major engineering structures by the Mabey Group, continued close to the town centre as well as on the Newhouse Farm industrial estate beside the M48 motorway, where wind turbine towers were assembled. In July 2015, the company announced that the site was to close with the loss of 125 jobs, following the decision by the UK government to end subsidies for onshore wind generation.

Other local industries have included the material for artificial ski slopes, developed at the &quot;Dendix&quot; brush factory, which in its time was a producer of all sizes of industrial brushes. The works, now operated by Osborn-Unipol, relocated out of the town centre to a new site beside the motorway in 2011. There are smaller industrial estates in Bulwark, and close to the town&#x27;s railway station, and the Newhouse Farm industrial estate is also a major distribution centre. Other notable locally based businesses have included Architen Landrell, a manufacturer of tensile architectural structures, whose closure was announced in December 2015; and MVM Films, a distributor of Japanese animated films.
Chepstow is primarily a centre for service industries and tourism in South West England and Wales. Due to its very good rail and road links, Chepstow has a large commuter population, commuters travel to larger centres in Bristol and in South Wales. Its location at the southern end of the Wye Valley, together with its own sights including its castle and racecourse, have contributed to its development as a tourist centre. The Chepstow Chamber of Commerce represents businesses in the town and aims to support and encourage their development. Blue plaques for English Heritage and other groups are made in the town.

Chepstow town centre has over 130 shops within easy walking distance of 1,000 car park spaces. There are 16 hotels, bars and public houses, and 15 restaurants and cafes. The town has Tesco and M&amp;S Foodhall supermarkets, and Screwfix, within or adjoining the town centre, together with a Lidl store at Bulwark and a B &amp; M store close to the motorway junction at Thornwell. The town has one bank and many independent cafes and restaurants. It also has several independent shops, though the family-run department store, Herbert Lewis, closed in 2018 after 140 years. National chains represented include W.H. Smith, Peacocks, Boots, Superdrug, and Poundland. The pedestrianised St Mary&#x27;s Street contains antique shops, gift shops, an independent book shop, coffee shops and restaurants. There are also regular farmers&#x27; markets and produce markets in the town centre. A regular open air weekly market at the racecourse closed in 2014. The town&#x27;s livestock market closed in the early 1960s.

According to the 2001 Census, Chepstow had relatively high proportions of its population working in the retail and wholesale sectors of the economy (19.6%, compared with 16.3% for Wales as a whole), property services (11.3%, compared with 8.5% across Wales), and transport and communications (9.4% compared with 5.5% across Wales). The proportion working in manufacturing was lower than the average (15.2% compared with 17.3% across Wales), as was the proportion working in health and social work (9.3% compared to 13.0% across Wales). In terms of occupational groups, the proportions of residents in higher status managerial, professional and associate technical posts was higher than average (totalling 44.1% compared with 35.4% across Wales), and the proportions in administrative, personal services and processing work were lower.

In 2018 Chepstow was declared by campaign group Surfers Against Sewage to be the first &quot;Plastic Free Town&quot; in south Wales.

==Transport==
Chepstow is located close to junction 2 of the M48 motorway, at the western end of the Severn Bridge. The bridge was opened in 1966 and has the second longest span of any bridge in the UK; it replaced the Aust-Beachley ferry. Before the Severn Bridge was opened, the Old Wye Bridge across the River Wye at Chepstow, built in 1816 to replace earlier wooden structures, carried all the road traffic between South West England and South Wales and was the lowest bridging point of the Wye. The M48 motorway now connects Chepstow by road to Newport () and Cardiff () to the west, and Bristol () and London () to the east. To the north, the A466 up the Wye valley connects the town with Monmouth (), and to the north-east the A48 links it with Gloucester ().

Chepstow railway station is on the main line between and . Most connections to Bristol Temple Meads and London Paddington are via Newport or Severn Tunnel Junction (). Chepstow is serviced by Transport for Wales Rail; the service provided by CrossCountry from Cardiff Central to , via Birmingham New Street. The railway bridge also known as &quot;The Great Tubular Bridge&quot; spanning the River Wye between Chepstow and Sedbury was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1852 as part of the Great Western Railway, but the original structure was replaced in the 1960s. Until 1959, passenger trains also operated up the Wye Valley Railway to Monmouth – this service ceased owing to heavy financial losses. The line at Chepstow was blocked by a landslide on 12 November 2009, following heavy rain.

Chepstow was home to Red &amp; White Services, one of the region&#x27;s largest bus and coach operators. Their head office and central workshops were at Bulwark from the early 1930s to mid-1980s. Red &amp; White was a major employer in Chepstow for the fifty years it existed. The company became defunct as part of the privatised National Welsh bus company but was re-established as Stagecoach Red &amp; White following the acquisition of the assets of National Welsh by Stagecoach. Although the name Stagecoach Red and White was subsequently dropped, the legal name of Stagecoach South Wales is Red &amp; White Services Ltd.

The nearest major airports to Chepstow are at Bristol () and Cardiff ().

==Demographics==
The population of Chepstow at the 2021 census was recorded as roughly 11,900. Of this, 23.4% were between the ages of 45 and 59, above the county average of 22.5%. The largest ethnic group is White with 96.4% of the population, below the county average of 96.9%, with the second largest being Asian/Asian British who make up 1.1% of the population, below the county average of 1.3%. The largest religious group is No religion with 47.4% of the population, above the county average of 43.4%, with the second largest being Christian at 45.1%, below the county average of 48.7%.

According to the 2021 census, 9.4% of Chepstow residents could speak, read or write Welsh, 2% could understand spoken Welsh only and 88.6% had no skills in Welsh at all.

==Education and health==

The town is served by Chepstow School, located on Welsh Street, with over 1,300 pupils. There are four primary schools in the town: The Dell, Pembroke, Thornwell, and St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic. Tutshill and Sedbury, on the English side of the Wye but within walking distance of Chepstow and attracting some pupils from the town, have their own schools, including Wyedean School, and the private preparatory Dean Close St John&#x27;s in Tutshill.

Chepstow Community Hospital was opened in 2000, having been developed under the United Kingdom Government&#x27;s Private Finance Initiative. It was built and is operated by Kintra Ltd, at an annual charge of £1.2m to Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust. The hospital building incorporates mementoes from the past, including the old Admiralty portico moulding from the front facade of the former Mount Pleasant Hospital, which was located on an adjacent site now developed as a housing estate.

==Religion==
In the 2021 census, 45.1% of Chepstow&#x27;s resident population gave their religion as Christian, with 47.4% stating &quot;no religion&quot;. There are several churches in the town. St Mary&#x27;s Priory Church was founded by about 1072 as a Benedictine priory, and retains its ornamented Norman west entrance doorway, decorated with zig zag and lozenge patterns. The priory was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, and became the parish church. It was substantially rebuilt during the nineteenth century, and now holds regular services as part of the Church in Wales. The Baptist Church, in Lower Church Street, was built in 1816, by Walter G. Watkin, and later enlarged. The origins of the Methodist Church lie in a visit to the town made by John Wesley in 1762. In 1801, a Methodist Chapel was built in what is now Oxford Street. St Christopher&#x27;s church (Anglican), and St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, are both located in the Bulwark area.

==Culture and regular events==
The town holds a biennial community festival, as well as an annual agricultural show and the annual Wassail and Mari Lwyd in January. There is a local Welsh society for the area, Cymdeithas Cymraeg Cas-gwent, Cil-y-coed a&#x27;r cyffiniau, holding numerous Welsh language events throughout the year that are open to all. In the early 2000s the community organised major son et lumière pageants covering aspects of local history, using local residents under professional direction. Since 2012, an annual series of &quot;Castell Roc&quot; music events has been held inside Chepstow Castle each August, featuring performances by artists such as Leo Sayer, Dr Hook, Bad Manners, and Jools Holland.

The Chepstow Museum, first established by the Chepstow Society, is housed in an elegant 1796 town house opposite the Castle entrance. Chepstow has no dedicated cinema or theatre, although film showings, theatrical and other events regularly take place in the Drill Hall, close to the Castle and riverside area. Chepstow is also home to the Electric Picture Hall, which organises regular &#x27;pop-up&#x27; cinema events and a Welsh themed short film festival each year, with the long-term goal of establishing a dedicated cinema and performing arts space for the town. Group community activities also take place in the Palmer Community Centre and Bulwark Community Centre.

The town had, for a short period, its own online local radio station, Chepstow Radio.

Chepstow is twinned with Cormeilles, France.

The town is the base for The Widders Border Morris Men who were formed in 2001. Some of the members were bikers who coined the group&#x27;s name, claiming they looked like the &#x27;Black Widows&#x27;, a bike gang from film &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;. In 2010 the team were invited to represent Wales in a Celtic music festival in France. The black, skull-like face-paint, used by the team members, was originally used to mask identities. The team&#x27;s foreman Mick Widder has described the group: &quot;We’re from the dark side of Morris dancing. We’re the punk rockers of the morris world. We are drinkers with a dance problem.&quot;

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Cymru Wales and BBC West on BBC One, and by ITV Cymru Wales and ITV West Country on ITV1. Television signals are from either the Wenvoe TV transmitter, supplemented by a low power relay transmitter situated north east of the town, or the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio Bristol and BBC Radio Gloucestershire both can also be heard, Heart South Wales, Nation Radio Wales and Sunshine Radio.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Chepstow Beacon&quot; and &quot;South Wales Argus&quot;

==Sport and leisure==

Chepstow Racecourse is the leading horse racing facility and course in Wales. It is located on the edge of the town, in the grounds of the ruined Piercefield House. The racecourse was opened in 1926, and became the regular venue of the Welsh National in 1949.

Chepstow Town F.C. was founded in 1878 and as of 2017 play in Division Three of the Welsh Football League. Chepstow RFC was also founded in 1878, by pupils and staff of Chepstow Grammar School. Matches are played at the Upton Memorial Ground, Lower Western Avenue. As of 2017 the team play in Division Three East A of the WRU National League The town also has an athletic Club for archery (St Kingsmark Bowmen), tennis, bowls, cricket and junior football. The 1976 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, won by Carlos Lopes, were held in the town. Two long routes of the National Cycle Network start in Chepstow, including the Celtic Trail (Lôn Geltaidd). Chepstow has also held professional and amateur street cycling events, such as the Chepstow Grand Prix.

The town&#x27;s leisure centre is located adjoining Chepstow School. The centre is owned by Monmouthshire County Council. Its facilities include an indoor swimming pool and both indoor and outdoor games pitches.
Chepstow Harriers running club, founded in the 1880s, meets twice weekly at the centre in addition to scheduled events.

Since its heyday as a centre for the &quot;Wye Tour&quot; in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Chepstow has remained an important centre for tourism. The town has a range of hotels and guest houses. As well as its own attractions, including the castle, the town is close to other attractions including the Royal Forest of Dean, Tintern Abbey and the Wye Valley, the Marriott St Pierre Hotel and Country Club, and the National Diving and Activity Centre at Tidenham. Several long distance trails – the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, the Wye Valley Walk, the Wales Coast Path, and the Gloucestershire Way – pass through, or very close to, the town.

Chepstow Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1914. The club disappeared in the 1960s.

==Landmarks==
Chepstow contains five Grade I listed buildings – the Castle, Priory Church, Town Gate, Port Wall and Old Wye Bridge – and several with Grade II* listed status.

===Chepstow Castle===

Chepstow Castle overlooks the River Wye, a short distance downhill from the town centre. The Great Tower is the oldest part of the complex and dates from the late 11th century. The castle was extended, both westwards and eastwards, in later centuries, but fell into ruin after the Civil War. There is a large car park in front of the castle, beside the Tourist Information Centre and opposite Chepstow Museum. The castle is under the management of Cadw, and is open to the public every day of the year, apart from four bank holidays around Christmas and New Year. It is entered through the late-12th-century gatehouse, and contains exhibitions on the castle&#x27;s history. A footpath beside the castle, through the Dell, is the start and finishing stretch of the Wye Valley Walk.

===Town Gate and Port Wall===

Much of Chepstow&#x27;s late-13th-century Port Wall remains intact, although the stretch south of the railway line was demolished when the National Shipyard was constructed in 1916. The wall is best seen adjoining the main town car park in Welsh Street, or beside the main A48 road at the top of School Hill. It can also be seen adjoining the Gate House, which was built in 1609 beside the Town Gate at the top (western) end of the High Street. The Town Gate, now a single carriageway roadway controlled by traffic lights, was once the only point of entrance to the town centre other than the bridge below the castle. It was rebuilt in 1524 and has undergone several renovations since then, most recently in 1986. The Gate House and the room above the archway itself are occasionally opened to the public.

===Priory Church of St Mary===

Chepstow Priory was established in 1067, at the same time as the castle. Its Norman west doorway remains intact, as do some mediaeval and later interior features including Jacobean tombs. The Priory Church of St Mary became the town&#x27;s parish church after the English Reformation. Its tower dates from the early 18th century, and the entire church was substantially rebuilt and extended in the mid-19th century, a process which destroyed some of its earlier features.

===Bridges and the riverside===

The Old Wye Bridge below the castle was built in 1816, on the site of earlier wooden bridges. The cast iron structure is noted for its elegance. It now carries a single carriageway road controlled by traffic lights. The eastern end of the bridge, in Gloucestershire, is the start and finish point of the Gloucestershire Way. The riverside area of Chepstow was once an open area of shipyards surrounded by warehouses. It has been landscaped, to incorporate flood defence works, and is now the start and finish point of the Wales Coast Path. The gardens contain a bandstand used for summer concerts. The Chepstow Railway Bridge, slightly downstream, was built to an innovative and functional design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1852. Most of Brunel&#x27;s structures have since been replaced. The railway bridge runs alongside the A48 road bridge opened in 1988.
===Medieval and later buildings===
The town contains several notable post-mediaeval buildings. Grade II* listed buildings include:
* Castle Terrace – a row of bay-fronted terraced houses, built in about 1810 on Bridge Street (then called St Anne&#x27;s Street), the road leading down to the Castle;
* Powis Almshouses – an L-shaped stone-built block of almshouses at the top of Bridge Street, built in 1721 following a bequest from a locally born vintner, Thomas Powis, who worked in London;
* Raglan Lodge – a Regency building in the town centre, Beaufort Square, built above a vaulted stone cellar which may have been a town hall or administrative centre for the mediaeval lordship.
The heyday of the town&#x27;s prosperity as a trading port in the late 18th and early 19th century is shown by the large number of town houses of that period, many of which are now used for other purposes such as offices and shops. One example is Gwy House, built in 1796 for a leading local merchant, which now houses the museum. The town centre itself features stone carvings, artworks, and information plaques placed in the pavement and walls, installed as part of a regeneration scheme in 2004/05; they illustrate Chepstow&#x27;s history.

===Chepstow Racecourse and Piercefield===

Chepstow Racecourse was opened in 1926 in the grounds of Piercefield House, north of the town centre on the road towards Tintern. Piercefield House itself, a mansion house rebuilt in the late 18th century, is now ruined. Its wooded grounds, overlooking the River Wye, contain landscaped features from the time when visits to the estate were an important component of the &quot;Wye Tour&quot;; they are now incorporated into the Wye Valley Walk.

==Notable people==

Chepstow was the birthplace of the fraudster and &quot;Popish Plot&quot; informer William Bedloe (1650–1680), and of the physician and satirist James Davis (1706/07–1755). James Stephens (1821–1889), a stonemason who was a supporter of the Chartists and later an influential Australian trade unionist, was born in the town, as was Sir Isambard Owen (1857–1927), a physician who became an academic and a leading figure in the formation of the University of Wales. John Fitchett Marsh (1818–1880), who had been responsible for establishing the first municipal library at Warrington, retired to Hardwick Court at Chepstow in 1873 and wrote on the history of the castle. The entomologist Eleanor Anne Ormerod (1828–1901) was born at nearby Sedbury Park, the house owned by her father, the antiquary George Ormerod.
H.E. Fulford (1859–1929), born in Chepstow of Australian parents, joined the British Foreign Service and for several decades occupied important consular posts in China.

Able Seaman William Charles Williams (1880–1915), who was born in Shropshire but raised in Chepstow, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in World War I. A gun from a captured German U-boat was presented to the town to mark his bravery, and stands in the town&#x27;s main square beside the Chepstow War Memorial. The neo-Baroque War Memorial itself was designed by local architect Eric Francis (1887–1976), who was also responsible for several notable country houses in the area.

Sportsmen born in the town have included Surrey and Middlesex cricketer Ted Pooley (1842–1907); Eddie Parris (1911–1971), the first black player to play international football for Wales; Olympic gold medal winning show jumper Richard Meade (1938–2015); and two more Wales international footballers, Ollie Burton (born 1941) and Paul Parry (born 1980). In the field of entertainment, locally born figures have included Grant Nicholas (born 1967) of the band Feeder, who grew up in the neighbouring village of Pwllmeyric, and film and television actor Owain Yeoman (born 1978), star of &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. The actor Leslie Sands lived in Chepstow before his death in 2001.

The writer J. K. Rowling (born 1965), author of the Harry Potter books, lived in the adjoining village of Tutshill from the age of 9, and attended secondary school at Wyedean School. Horticulturalist and writer Adam Alexander maintains a 3.5 acre farm at Itton near Chepstow.

<doc id="249425" wikidata="Q2290103" url="?curid=249425" title="Hastur">
<text>Hastur (The Unspeakable One, The King in Yellow, Him Who Is Not to be Named, Assatur, Xastur, H&#x27;aaztre, Fenric, or Kaiwan) is an entity of the Cthulhu Mythos.

Hastur first appeared in Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;Haïta the Shepherd&quot; (1891) as a benign god of shepherds. Subsequently Robert W. Chambers used the name in his late 1800s stories to represent both a person and a place associated with several stars, including Aldebaran. H. P. Lovecraft was inspired by Chambers&#x27;s stories and briefly mentioned Hastur in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1930). Later writers have also adapted Hastur in a variety of tales.

==Appearances==
===Hastur in the mythos===

In Chambers&#x27; &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; (1895), a collection of horror stories, Hastur is the name of a potentially supernatural character (in &quot;The Demoiselle D&#x27;Ys&quot;), a place (in &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;), and mentioned without explanation in &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot;. The latter two stories also mention Carcosa, Hali, Aldebaran, and the Hyades, along with a &quot;Yellow Sign&quot; and a play called &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;.

H. P. Lovecraft read Chambers&#x27; book in early 1927. Lovecraft was so enchanted by the book that he added elements of it to his own creations. There are two places in Lovecraft&#x27;s own writings in which Hastur is mentioned:

I found myself faced by names and terms that I had heard elsewhere in the most hideous of connections—Yuggoth, Great Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, R&#x27;lyeh, Nyarlathotep, Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the Yellow Sign, L’mur-Kathulos, Bran, and the Magnum Innominandum—and was drawn back through nameless aeons and inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder, outer entity at which the crazed author of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; had only guessed in the vaguest way.

:— H. P. Lovecraft, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;

Later in the same story, it is described that the Mi-Go have been attacked by followers of Hastur, and Hastur is an enemy of the Outer Ones whom the Mi-Go serve:

Actually, they have never knowingly harmed men, but have often been cruelly wronged and spied upon by our species. There is a whole secret cult of evil men (a man of your mystical erudition will understand me when I link them with Hastur and the Yellow Sign) devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions. It is against these aggressors—not against normal humanity—that the drastic precautions of the Outer Ones are directed.

:— H. P. Lovecraft, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;

* In &quot;Supernatural Horror In Literature&quot; (written 1926–27, revised 1933, published in &quot;The Recluse&quot; in 1927), when telling about &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; by Chambers, H. P. Lovecraft wrote:

...after stumbling queerly upon the hellish and forbidden book of horrors the two learn, among other hideous things which no sane mortal should know, that this talisman is indeed the nameless Yellow Sign handed down from the accursed cult of Hastur—from primordial Carcosa, whereof the volume treats...

* In Chambers&#x27; &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; the only mentioning of Hastur is:

&quot;...We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda...&quot;

Judging from these two quotes, it is quite possible that H. P. Lovecraft not only recognized Hastur as one of the mythos gods, but even made him so recalling Chambers&#x27; book.

Derleth also developed Hastur into a Great Old One, spawn of Yog-Sothoth, the half-brother of Cthulhu, and possibly the Magnum Innominandum. In this incarnation, Hastur has several Avatars:

* The Feaster from Afar: A black, shriveled, flying monstrosity with tentacles tipped with razor-sharp talons that can pierce a victim&#x27;s skull and siphon out the brain.
* The King in Yellow

Anders Fager&#x27;s &quot;Collected Swedish Cults&quot; features a Stockholm-based coterie known as &quot;The Carcosa Foundation&quot; that worships Hastur.

Hastur is amorphous, but he is described as a vast, vaguely octopoid being. In the mythos, Hastur is presented as having &quot;a strange effect on artists and playwrights&quot;.

===Other appearances===

Hastur has appeared in other media. In the light novel and anime series &quot;Haiyore! Nyaruko-san&quot;, which is based on the Cthulhu mythos, one of the main characters, Hastua, is a Japanized version of and direct reference to Hastur.

Hastur appears in the 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons book Deities &amp; Demigods published by TSR, Inc. in 1980.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s and Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Good Omens&quot;, Hastur is the name of a demon. In the TV series adaptation of &quot;Good Omens&quot;, Hastur is portrayed by Ned Dennehy.

Hastur is the name of a hunter in the video game &quot;Identity V&quot; who is also known as The Feaster and The King in Yellow.

Hastur also appears as a character in the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;.

Hastur is also believed to be the King in Yellow in the video game &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot;. The player also receives the Yellow Sign from them directly.

The short story &quot;Gramma&quot; by Stephen King features a demonic entity named Hastur, who also appeared in the 18th episode of the 1985 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; adaptation and the 2014 film adaptation, &quot;Mercy&quot;. &quot;Gramma&quot; was translated into Marathi by Indian writer Narayan Dharap as &quot;Aaji&quot;, which served as a basis for the 2019 film &quot;Tumbbad&quot;, in which Hastur (stylized as Hastar) is the first and most beloved offspring of the Goddess of Prosperity who robbed her of her gold and was stopped while attempting to steal her grain.

Though not named directly, The King in Yellow is mentioned and connected to Carcosa in the first season of the HBO series &quot;True Detective&quot;.

In the Doctor Who &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; novel &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot;, Hastur the Unspeakable is either one of the names/titles belonging to or the original name of the Great Old One, Fenric.

Hastur appears in the &quot;Persona&quot; games, as both a villain and summonable ally.

Hastur is featured on the cover of The King In Yellow in &quot;SIGNALIS&quot;.

In the sixth novel in Charles Stross Laundry Files, &quot;The Annihilation Score&quot; (2017), the protagonist is Dr. Dominique &quot;Mo&quot; O&#x27;Brien is compelled by her violin to summon The King in Yellow, with poems referencing Hastur and Carcosa.

Hastur the Unspeakable, god of shepherds, appears in Jonathan Maberry&#x27;s &quot;Kagen the Damned&quot; series as the god of Hakkia and his chief priest the Witch-King, Gethon Heklan, the King in Yellow. The first novel of the series was published in 2022.

<doc id="249426" wikidata="Q320043" url="?curid=249426" title="Pied kingfisher">
<text>The pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) is a species of water kingfisher widely distributed across Africa and Asia. Originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, it has five recognised subspecies. Its black and white plumage and crest, as well as its habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish, make it distinctive. Males have a double band across the breast, while females have a single broken breast band. They are usually found in pairs or small family groups. When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The pied kingfisher was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, who noted that it lived in Persia and Egypt. He named it &quot;Alcedo rudis&quot;. The German naturalist Friedrich Boie erected the genus &quot;Ceryle&quot; in 1828. The name is from classical Greek &quot;kērulos&quot;, an unidentified and probably mythical bird mentioned by Aristotle and other authors. The specific epithet &quot;rudis&quot; is Latin for &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;rude&quot;.

The pied kingfisher is the only member of the genus &quot;Ceryle&quot;. Molecular analysis shows it is an early offshoot of the lineage that gave rise to American kingfishers of the genus &quot;Chloroceryle&quot;. The pied kingfisher was initially believed to be descended from an ancestral American green kingfisher which crossed the Atlantic Ocean about one million years ago. A more recent suggestion is that the pied kingfisher and the American green kingfishers are derived from an Old World species, with the pied kingfisher or its ancestor losing the metallic colouration afterwards.

There are five subspecies:
* &quot;C. r. syriacus&quot; – Turkey to Israel east to southwest Iran (some ornithologists do not recognise this subspecies)
* &quot;C. r. rudis&quot; – Egypt and Africa south of the Sahara
* &quot;C. r. leucomelanurus&quot; – east Afghanistan through India to south China and north Indochina
* &quot;C. r. travancoreensis&quot; – southwest India
* &quot;C. r. insignis&quot; – east and southeast China, Hainan Island

==Description==
This is a medium-sized kingfisher, about long with a white with a black mask, a white supercilium and black breast bands. The crest is neat and the upperparts are barred in black. Several subspecies are recognized within the broad distribution. The nominate race is found in sub-Saharan Africa, extending into West Asia. The subspecies &quot;syriacus&quot; is a larger northern bird similar to the nominate subspecies (following Bergmann&#x27;s rule). Subspecies &quot;leucomelanura&quot; is found from Afghanistan east into India, Thailand and Southeast Asia. The subspecies &quot;travancoreensis&quot; of the Western Ghats is darker with the white reduced. The subspecies &quot;C. r. insignis&quot; is found in Hainan and southeastern China and has a much larger bill. Males have a narrow second breast-band while females have a single broken breast band.

==Distribution==
It is common throughout sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia from Turkey to India to China. It is resident, and most birds do not migrate, other than short-distance seasonal movements. In India it is distributed mainly on the plains and is replaced in the higher hills of the Himalayas by the crested kingfisher (&quot;Megaceryle lugubris&quot;).

The pied kingfisher is estimated to be one of the three most numerous kingfishers in the world; the other two are the common kingfisher and collared kingfisher. It is a noisy bird, making it hard to miss.

==Behaviour==
When perched the pied kingfisher often bobs its heads up and down and will sometimes raise its tail and flick it downwards. It calls often with sharp &quot;&quot; notes. Unlike some kingfishers, it is quite gregarious, and forms large roosts at night.

===Feeding===
This kingfisher feeds mainly on fish, although it will take crustaceans and large aquatic insects such as dragonfly larvae. It usually hunts by hovering over the water to detect prey, before diving vertically bill-first to capture fish. When not foraging, it has a straight rapid flight and have been observed flying at speeds approaching 50 km/h.
In Lake Victoria in East Africa, the introduction of the Nile perch reduced the availability of haplochromine cichlids which were formerly the preferred prey of these birds.

It can consume prey without returning to a perch, often manipulating the subject with its bill and swallowing in flight, and so can hunt over large water bodies or in estuaries that lack perches required by other kingfishers.

===Breeding===
The breeding season in India is February to April. Its nest is a hole excavated in a vertical mud bank about five feet above water. The nest tunnel is four to five feet deep and ends in a chamber. Several birds may nest in the same vicinity. The usual clutch is three to six white eggs. The pied kingfisher sometimes reproduces cooperatively, with young non-breeding birds from an earlier brood assisting parents or even unrelated older birds. In India, nestlings have been found to be prone to maggot infestations (probably by &quot;Protocalliphora&quot; sp.) and in some areas to leeches. Nest holes may sometimes be used for roosting.

In 1947, British zoologist Hugh B. Cott noticed while skinning birds that hornets were attracted to certain birds but avoided the flesh of pied kingfishers. This led to a comparative study of edibility of birds and he suggested that more conspicuously plumaged birds may be less palatable. This suggestion was, however, not supported by a subsequent reanalysis of his data.

<text>Irma Ilse Ida Grese (7 October 1923 – 13 December 1945) was a Nazi concentration camp at Ravensbrück, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and Bergen-Belsen. She has been widely known as the &quot;Hyena of Auschwitz&quot; and the &quot;Beast of Belsen&quot; for the atrocities she committed in Birkenau.

Following the Allied occupation of Nazi Germany in April 1945, Grese was found guilty of war crimes involving the torture and murder of Jewish prisoners at the Belsen trial and sentenced to death by hanging. She was executed at the age of twenty-two, making her the youngest woman to die judicially under British law in the twentieth century.

==Early life==
Irma Ilse Ida Grese was born on 7 October 1923, in , a rural village in Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, to parents Alfred Anton Albert Grese and Berta Wilhelmine Winter. She was the third of five children, the others being Helene, Lieschen, Alfred, and Otto. Alfred worked as a senior milker at the , a small dairy farm with two farmhands and a few cows that provided a modest income for the Grese family. Berta, a housewife, cared for the family garden and the few animals they had, including pigs, geese, and chickens.

According to professor and author Daniel Patrick Brown, Berta was a &quot;troubled woman&quot; who struggled with the family&#x27;s financial instability. In late 1935, she attempted suicide by ingesting hydrochloric acid after discovering Alfred&#x27;s affair with the daughter of the local pub owner. Berta died months later, in January 1936. Grese, who was twelve years old at the time, found her mother dead.

There are conflicting accounts of Alfred&#x27;s personality and role as a father in Grese&#x27;s life. While Irma stated in 1943 that he was &quot;very religious and conservative and did not believe in Nazism&quot;, Alfred enjoyed drinking but he was not an alcoholic, had not physically abused his children, and had joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and become an , though he was not an extremist.

Grese became a member of the in 1937 or 1938. She later told survivor Magda Hellinger that she was &quot;quite proud of this because the organization was open only to &#x27;genuine&#x27; Aryans,&quot; but her membership caused a rift between herself and her father. Grese&#x27;s previously unremarkable personality began to change during this period. According to Wrechen residents, she became more withdrawn and would &quot;stand on a hill and whistle like some boy&quot; and did not show any interest in interacting with her peers, who allegedly bullied her.

Grese left school in 1938 at the age of fourteen and worked at a dairy factory in Fürstenberg for six months before moving on to work as a retail clerk in a small shop in Lychen for another six. Grese was hired the following year as an apprentice aide to an assistant nurse at the Hohenlychen Sanatorium, where SS personnel received treatment. She was mentored by director Karl Gebhardt, whom Grese later described as a &quot;saint&quot; of the Nazi Party. She was eventually let go from her position in 1941 because she did not meet expectations, though Grese claimed years later that the prevented her from becoming a nurse. Gebhardt pitied Grese and gave her the contact information for a colleague who worked at the Ravensbrück concentration camp.

==Work as a ==
===KZ Ravensbrück (1942–1943)===
Grese was initially denied entry into Ravensbrück&#x27;s training program. She met with Gebhardt&#x27;s colleague and was instructed to come back when she turned eighteen, which was six months away. She did not return within the expected time frame, however, because she was hired to work at another dairy farm from March 1941 to June 1942.

It was in July 1942 when she entered Ravensbrück as a trainee. She successfully completed the program in three weeks, after which she was given the title of . During her seven-month employment at the camp, where she received fifty-four Reichsmarks per month, she was claimed to have excelled her superiors.

Grese went to see her father Alfred in 1943, who had remarried in 1939 to a widow with four children of her own, while wearing her SS uniform. Alfred was initially impressed with Grese, who had not told him about the violence she had inflicted on the prisoners at the camp. Alfred&#x27;s opinion changed when his stepdaughter came to him in tears because Grese had torn the head and limbs off her doll, and his young son playfully aimed Grese&#x27;s revolver at him. Alfred reacted by taking the revolver from his son and striking Grese with it. Grese&#x27;s sister Helene recalled the situation at the Belsen trial, stating that she had not seen their father act violently against Grese, but she had heard them argued because the latter was in the .

Grese returned to Ravensbrück immediately following the incident, which would be her final return home, and spent the rest of her time at the concentration camp overseeing work details until March 1943, when she was transferred to Auschwitz II-Birkenau.

===KZ Auschwitz II-Birkenau (1943–1945)===
Grese was assigned to &quot;Camp B&quot; after arriving at Birkenau in March 1943, where she worked as a telephone operator in the office of a . She allegedly committed a violation while working on this assignment, prompting her to be trasferred to oversee a (punishment detail). While she would claim during the Belsen trial that she only oversaw this section for two days, argued that Grese was in charge for seven months and was responsible for the deaths of at least thirty prisoners per day.

Grese was assigned various duties within the camp over the next few months. In the autumn, she led a gardening squad before taking over as mail censor from Elisabeth Volkenrath in December. Grese, who was twenty-one years old at the time, was promoted to performing satisfactorily.

In May 1944, Grese was given the authority to oversee &quot;Camp C&quot;, which consisted of thirty-one huts and held approximately 30,000 Jewish women from Poland and Hungary. However, survivor Helen Spitzer Tichauer revealed in her 1945 testimony that Grese was insufficiently qualified to command this section of Birkenau alone. She was assigned to work alongside Luise Danz, a new transfer from the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp.

Grese committed the majority of her violent acts while in command of &quot;Camp C&quot;, where she wielded a rubber truncheon, pistol, and whip. Survivor Abraham Glinowieski stated in his testimony that Grese sent both sick and healthy Hungarian Jews to the gas chambers during selection. Survivor Edith Trieger also claimed Grese punched and kicked prisoners who attempted to flee the selection parades. Grese frequently ordered prisoners to &quot;make sport&quot;, which referred to strenuous punitive exercises.

Survivor Olga Lengyel made numerous claims about Grese&#x27;s sexual relations with SS personnel and both male and female Jewish prisoners whilst at Birkenau. Grese allegedly had affairs with married physician Josef Mengele and Josef Kramer, but her relationship with the former ended when he discovered her illicit liaisons with women.

Grese&#x27;s sexual interactions with imprisoned Jewish women were sadistic in nature, but they were frequent, according to a prisoner who had been appointed as her maid. Survivor Lengyel stated in her memoir that Grese had &quot;favorite&quot; prisoners who she would treat as slaves for a period of time until she became bored, at which point she would send the women to the gas chambers. Survivor Gisella Perl, who worked as a doctor at Birkenau, wrote in her own memoir that Grese experienced orgasmic pleasure while watching her operate on young women&#x27;s breasts that had been cut open by Grese&#x27;s whip and infected with lice or dirt, using only a knife and no anesthesia. Perl also stated that Grese would kick the young woman being operated on if her screams interfered with her arousal.

Grese remained at Birkenau&#x27;s &quot;Camp C&quot; until her brief transfer back to Ravensbrück on 18 January 1945, when all personnel were ordered to move westward due to the advance of Soviet forces.

===KZ Bergen-Belsen (1945)===
Grese&#x27;s final assignment was to Bergen-Belsen in early March 1945. During her three-and-a-half week tenure, she served as (labor service leader) and (commander of ).

She was not supposed to be assigned to Bergen-Belsen because Kramer planned to transfer her to another camp once she arrived. She was vehemently opposed to the transfer, however, because she wanted to stay with her new lover Franz Wolfgang Hatzinger, a married man fourteen years older whom Grese affectionately referred to as &quot;Hatchi&quot;. During the Belsen trial, Johanna Bormann testified that Grese and Hatzinger &quot;were very close and regularly sneaked off secretly to have sex&quot;.

Grese repeated the torturous and sadistic acts she committed at Birkenau in Bergen-Belsen. This included forcing prisoners to &quot;make sport&quot;, which she justified during her trial because she believed the prisoners were &quot;capable of partaking in such physical torment&quot;.

==Arrest and the Belsen trial==
Bergen-Belsen was liberated by British forces on 15 April 1945. Grese and a number of other high-ranking SS officers chose to remain at the camp while Kramer issued the official call to surrender. Grese was said to have appeared arrogant when the British arrived at the camp and became hostile when she attempted to attack a British officer who entered one of the huts, causing her to be immediately restrained.

Grese was arrested and imprisoned at the Wehrmacht Tank Training School, three kilometers from the camp, where she was interrogated for two days.

Grese&#x27;s trial in Lüneburg began on 17 September 1945, alongside forty-four other defendants, and became known as the Belsen trials, despite the fact that the majority of the atrocities were committed at Birkenau. Grese faced two separate charges for war crimes committed at Bergen-Belsen and Birkenau between 1 October 1942 and 30 April 1945. Grese defended herself against these charges, saying, &quot;Himmler is responsible for everything that has happened, but I suppose I am as much to blame as the others above me&quot;. 

Grese&#x27;s cold, arrogant, and unremorseful demeanor persisted throughout the trial, with terse answers to questions such as &quot;I should know better than you whether or not I had a dog, don&#x27;t you think?&quot; and &quot;I wish you would stop repeating the word &#x27;regularly&quot;, alluding to the numerous accusations made against her for her repeated violent acts against the prisoners. Grese&#x27;s only moment of vulnerability came when her sister Helene gave character witness testimony, recounting the volatile interaction between Irma and their father in 1943, which caused her to break down sobbing. Helene also testified that she did not believe Grese could have acted violently against any prisoners, stating that &quot;in our school days when, as it sometimes happens, girls were quarrelling or fighting, my sister never had the courage to fight, but on the contrary, she ran away&quot;.

Grese was found guilty of both war crime charges on the fifty-fourth day of the Belsen trial. When it was declared that she would be hanged, she &quot;showed total indifference&quot;. Her subsequent clemency appeal was denied because all anticipated pleas from the accused were rejected in advance.

Grese remained in the Lüneburg prison until 8 December, when she and the other ten guards sentenced to death were transferred to the Hamelin Prison.

==Execution==
Grese and two other SS women, Elizabeth Volkenrath and Juana Bormann, were sentenced to death. They spent the night before their executions laughing and singing Nazi songs. On the morning of 13 December 1945, she was the second woman to be hanged by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint. Her final word was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Quick&quot;), and her face was devoid of remorse. She was said to have been hanged first, as Pierrepoint wanted to &quot;[spare] her any kind of trauma&quot; because she was the youngest prisoner on the list to be executed, at twenty-two years old, but this was not the case. The original, dated and timed witnessed statements of the returned death warrants record that Grese was the second to be executed at 10:03, whereas Volkenrath was the first at 09:34, and Bormann at 10:38. 

To prevent people from turning Grese, and the rest of the men and women executed that day, into martyrs, the President of the Court ordered that her body and all the others, be buried in the courtyard of Hamelin Prison rather than the cemetery. It was in 1954 when the British vacated the site that all the remains were reburied in a single grave at Friedhof Am Wehl cemetery. The grave is unmarked to prevent a neo-Nazi shrine.

<text>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or more human occupants, and sometimes various companion animals. It is a fully- or semi-sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing.

Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space. The aspect of &#x27;home&#x27; can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.

The concept of &#x27;home&#x27; has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics. The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works. The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.

==History==

=== Prehistoric era ===

The earliest homes that humans inhabited were likely naturally occurring features such as caves. The earliest human fossils found in caves come from a series of caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane in South Africa. The cave sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai B, Drimolen, Malapa, Cooper&#x27;s D, Gladysvale, Gondolin and Makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago, including &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;. However, it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves, but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them.

The first early hominid ever found in Africa, the Taung Child in 1924, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being preyed upon by an eagle. However, this is now debated. Caves do form in the dolomite of the Ghaap Plateau, including the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age site of Wonderwerk Cave; however, the caves that form along the escarpment&#x27;s edge, like that hypothesized for the Taung Child, are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called tufa. There is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world, including &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in China at Zhoukoudian, &quot;Homo rhodesiensis&quot; in South Africa at the Cave of Hearths (Makapansgat), &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; in Europe at Archaeological Site of Atapuerca, &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; in Indonesia, and the Denisovans in southern Siberia.

In southern Africa, early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about 180,000 years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time. The oldest known site is PP13B at Pinnacle Point. This may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of Africa and colonization of areas of the world such as Australia by 60–50,000 years ago. Throughout southern Africa, Australia, and Europe, early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art, such as those at Giants Castle. Caves such as the yaodong in China were used for shelter; other caves were used for burials (such as rock-cut tombs), or as religious sites (such as Buddhist caves). Among the known sacred caves are China&#x27;s Cave of a Thousand Buddhas and the sacred caves of Crete. As technology progressed, humans and other hominids began constructing their own dwellings. Buildings such as huts and longhouses have been used for living since the late Neolithic.

=== Ancient era ===
=== Post-classical era ===
From the 14th to the 16th century, homelessness was perceived of as a &quot;vagrancy problem&quot; and legislative responses to the problem were predicated upon the threat it may pose to the state.

=== Modern era ===

According to Kirsten Gram-Hanssen, &quot;It can be argued that historically and cross-culturally there is not always [a] strong relation between the concept of home and the physical building, and that this mode of thinking is rooted in the Enlightenment of the seventeenth century&quot;. Before, one&#x27;s home was more public than private; traits such as privacy, intimacy and familiarity would proceed to achieve greater prominence, aligning the concept with the bourgeoisie. The connection between home and house was reinforced by a case law declaration from Edward Coke: &quot;The house of everyman is to him as his castle and fortress, as well as his defense against injury and violence, as for his repose&quot;. Colloquially, this was adapted into the phrase &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&quot; which popularised the notion of home as house.

A result of the longstanding association between home and women, 18th century English women, of upper-class status, were scorned for pursuing activities outside of the home, thus seen to be of undesirable character. The concept of home took on unprecedent prominence by the 18th century, reified by cultural practice.

The concept of a smart home arose in the 19th century in turn with electricity having been introduced to homes in a limited capacity. The distinction between home and work formulated in the 20th century, with home acting as sanctuary. Modern definitions portray home as a site of supreme comfort and familial intimacy, operating as a buffer to the greater world.

==Common types==
The concept of home is one with multiple interpretations, influenced by one&#x27;s history and identity. People of differing ages, genders, ethnicities and classes may have resultingly different meanings of home. Commonly, it is associated with various forms of abodes such as wagons, cars, boats or tents although it is equally considered to extend beyond the space, in mind and emotion. The space of a home need not be significant or fixed though the boundaries of home are often tied to the space. There have been multiple theories regarding one&#x27;s choice of home with the residential conditions of their childhood often reflected in their later choice of home. According to Paul Oliver, the vast majority of abodes are vernacular, constructed in accordance with the residents&#x27; needs.

=== House ===

A house is a single-unit residential building. It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.

The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household. Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals. Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat. Houses may provide &quot;certain activities, which gradually accumulate meaning until they become homes&quot;.

Joseph Rykwert distinguished between home and house in their physicality; a house requires a building whereas a home does not. &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;house&quot; are often used interchangeably, although their connotations may differ: &quot;house&quot; being &quot;emotionally neutral&quot; and &quot;home&quot; evoking &quot;personal, cognitive aspects&quot;. By the mid-18th century, the definition of home had extended beyond a house. &quot;Few English words are filled with the emotional meaning of the word home&quot;.

=== Moveable structures ===

Home as constitutionally mobile and transient has been contended by anthropologists and sociologist. A mobile home (also known as a house trailer, park home, trailer, or trailer home) is a prefabricated structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent homes, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are often left permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.

A houseboat is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily as a home. Some houseboats are not motorized, because they are usually moored, kept stationary at a fixed point and often tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own power. Float house is a Canadian and American term for a house on a float (raft); a rough house may be called a shanty boat. In Western countries, houseboats tend to be either owned privately or rented out to holiday-goers, and on some canals in Europe, people dwell in houseboats all year round. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Amsterdam, London, and Paris.

A traditional yurt or ger is a portable round tent covered with skins or felt and used as a dwelling by several distinct nomadic groups in the steppes of Central Asia. The structure consists of an angled assembly or latticework of wood or bamboo for walls, a door frame, ribs (poles, rafters), and a wheel (crown, compression ring) possibly steam-bent. The roof structure is often self-supporting, but large yurts may have interior posts supporting the crown. The top of the wall of self-supporting yurts is prevented from spreading by means of a tension band which opposes the force of the roof ribs. Modern yurts may be permanently built on a wooden platform; they may use modern materials such as steam-bent wooden framing or metal framing, canvas or tarpaulin, plexiglass dome, wire rope, or radiant insulation.

===Homelessness===

The state of being without a home can occur in many ways, ranging from the upheavals of natural disasters, fraud, theft, arson, or war-related destruction, to the more common voluntary sale, loss for one or more occupants on relationship breakdown, expropriation by government or legislated cause, repossession or foreclosure to pay secured debts, eviction by landlords, disposal by time-limited means – lease, or absolute gift. Jurisdiction-dependent means of home loss include adverse possession, unpaid property taxation and corruption such as in circumstances of a failed state.

Personal insolvency, development or sustaining of mental illness or severe physical incapacity without affordable domestic care commonly lead to a change of home. The underlying character of a home may be debased by structural defects, natural subsidence, neglect or soil contamination. Refugees are people who have fled their homes due to violence or persecution. They may seek temporary housing in a shelter or they may claim asylum in another country in an attempt to relocate permanently. A dysfunctional home life commonly precipitates one&#x27;s homelessness.

The dichotomy between home and homelessness is to the extent that the concept of home, scholars have said, is dependent on homelessness: &quot;in a sense, without homelessness, we would not be concerned with what home means&quot;.

== Anthropogenic significance ==

The connection between humans and dwelling is profound, such that, the likes of Gaston Bachelard and Martin Heidegger consider it an &quot;essential characteristic&quot; of humanity. A home is generally a place that is close to the heart of the owner, and can become a prized possession. It has been argued that psychologically &quot;The strongest sense of home commonly coincides geographically with a dwelling. Usually, the sense of home attenuates as one moves away from that point, but it does not do so in a fixed or regular way.&quot; A person&#x27;s conception of home can be dependent on congealing conditions, such as culture, geography or emotion; the sense of being at home may be contingent upon the presence of multiple emotions, such as joy, sorrow, nostalgia and pride. Further psychological interperation contends that homes serve the purpose of satisfying identity-based desires and expression and that it functions as a &quot;symbol of the self&quot;, bound to the events of one&#x27;s life. Emmanuel Levinas wrote of home as where, upon seclusion from the greater world, a sense of self can be regained.

There exist many connotations regarding the concept of a home, including of security, identity, ritual and socialisation, varied definitions and residents may associate their home with meanings, emotions, experiences and relationships. Home has been described as an &quot;essentially contested concept&quot;. Common connotations of home are espoused by both those with or without a home. It is the sociality and action of homes which some scholars have said conditions a house in to a home, which is, according to Gram-Hanssen, &quot;a phenomenon made by its residents&quot;. Dysfunctional sociality may negate the sense of a residence being a home whereas the physical contents may endow the sense; alienated from home one may feel &quot;metaphorically homeless&quot;. Romantic or nostalgic notions are typical in the conceptions of &quot;ideal homes&quot;, at once a cultural and individual concept. An ideal working-class home in Postwar Britain was one of comfort and cleanliness, plentiful with food and compassion.

In modern America, an owned house has greater cachet as a home than other residences; debate exists as to if a rooming house can provide a home. Some housing scholars have contended that a conflation of house and home is the result of popular media and capitalist interest. Differing cultures may perceive the concept of a home differently, ascribing less value to the privacy of a residence or the residence itself – although housing issues have been seen as of great concern to immigrants. The home can render to men and women in significant differences: men conditioned to experience great control and little labour and vice versa for women; homelessness too can be subject to differences per gender. Sociologist Shelley Mallett preposed the idea of home as abstractions: space, feeling, praxis or &quot;a way of being in the world&quot;. Abstract notions of home are present in the proverb &quot;A house is not a home&quot;.
Since it can be said that humans are generally creatures of habit, the state of a person&#x27;s home has been known to physiologically influence their behavior, emotions, and overall mental health. Marianne Gullestad wrote of the home as the center of and as an attempt to amalgamate everyday life; one&#x27;s conduct there, she said, can reflect greater culture or social values, such as gender roles insinuating the home to be the domain of women. To be homesick is to desire belonging, said Zygmunt Bauman. Places like homes can trigger self-reflection, thoughts about who someone is or used to be or who they might become. These types of reflections also occur in places where there is a collective historical identity, such as Gettysburg or Ground Zero. The time spent with one&#x27;s home is a considerable element in establishing one&#x27;s attachment. Those without significant time spent of their life in a residence often struggle to consider home as a feature of residences. The perception of one&#x27;s home can extend beyond the residence itself, to their neighbourhood, family, workplace or nation and one may feel as though they have multiple homes; to have felt at home beyond residence can be a significant element in one&#x27;s appraisal of their life, a time in which notions of home, it has been observed, are more profound. The connection between home and family is pertinent, to the extent that some scholars consider the terms to be synonymous.

<text>In video games, a boss is a significantly powerful non-player character created as an opponent to players. A fight with a boss character is referred to as a boss battle or boss fight. Bosses are generally far stronger than other opponents the players have faced up to that point in a game. Boss battles are generally seen at climax points of particular sections of games, such as at the end of a level or stage or guarding a specific objective. A [[#Miniboss|miniboss]] is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level, though usually more powerful than the standard opponents and often fought alongside them. A [[#Superboss|superboss]] (sometimes &#x27;secret&#x27;, &#x27;hidden&#x27; or &#x27;raid&#x27; boss) is generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game&#x27;s plot and is often an optional encounter. A [[#Final boss|final boss]] is often the main antagonist of a game&#x27;s story and the defeat of that character usually provides a conclusion to the game. A boss rush is a stage where players face multiple previous bosses again in succession.

For example, in a run &#x27;n&#x27; gun video game, all regular enemies might use pistols while the boss uses a tank. A boss enemy is quite often larger in size than other enemies and the player character. At times, bosses are very hard to defeat without being adequately prepared and/or knowing the correct fighting approach. Bosses usually take strategy and special knowledge to defeat, such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks.

Bosses are common in many genres of video games, but they are especially common in story-driven titles, and are commonly previously established antagonists in the plot of the video game. Action-adventure games, beat &#x27;em ups, fighting games, platform games, role-playing video games (RPGs), and shooter games are particularly associated with boss battles. They may be less common in puzzle games, card video games, racing games, and simulation games. The first video game with a boss fight was the 1975 RPG &quot;dnd&quot;.

The concept has expanded to other genres, like rhythm games, where there may be a &quot;boss song&quot; that is more difficult, or a high-difficulty, computer-controlled opponent in sports games. In multiplayer online battle arena games, defeating a map boss usually requires teamwork of two or more players, but it brings various benefits to the team, such as buffs or lane push power. Some games, such as &quot;Cuphead&quot;, &quot;Furi&quot; and &quot;Warning Forever&quot;, are centered around continual boss fights.

==Characteristics==
Bosses are usually harder to beat than regular enemies, have higher health points, hence can sustain more damage and are generally found at the end of a level or area. While most games include a mixture of boss opponents and regular opponents, some games have only regular opponents and some games have only bosses (e.g. &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;). Some bosses are encountered several times through a single game, typically with alternate attacks and a different strategy required to defeat it each time. A boss battle can also be made more challenging if the boss in question becomes progressively stronger and/or less vulnerable as their health decreases, requiring players to use different strategies to win. Some bosses may contain or be composed of smaller parts that can be destroyed by players in battle, which may or may not grant an advantage. In games such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;&quot;, an enemy may be introduced via a boss battle, but later appear as a regular enemy, after players have become stronger or had a chance to find more powerful weaponry.

Many games structure boss battles as a progression of distinct phases in which the boss produces different or additional hazards for players. This is often reflected by a change in the appearance of the boss, or by a boss displaying increased frustration.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series and games inspired by it are recognized for having dungeons with bosses that are specifically vulnerable to a special item that is located within that dungeon. Player(s) typically acquire this item while exploring the dungeon and is given opportunity to learn to use it to solve puzzles or defeat weaker enemies before facing the boss character.

Boss battles are typically seen as dramatic events. As such, they are usually characterized by sometimes quite theatrical cutscenes before and after the boss battle and unique music. Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific theme music to distinguish them from other boss battles. This concept extends beyond combat-oriented video games. For example, a number of titles in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; rhythm game series contain &quot;boss songs&quot; that are called &quot;bosses&quot; because they are exceptionally difficult to perform on.

In combat-focused games, a boss may summon additional enemies, reinforcements, or minions (&quot;adds&quot;) to fight players alongside the boss, increasing the boss fight&#x27;s difficulty. These additional enemies may distract from the boss battle or give time for the boss to regain or regenerate health, but may also give players opportunity to regain health from health boosters and ammo dropped by the boss&#x27;s defeated minions.

==Specific boss types==

===Miniboss===

A miniboss, also known as a &quot;middle boss&quot;, &quot;mid-boss&quot;, &quot;half-boss&quot;, &quot;sub-boss&quot; &quot;semi-boss&quot;, or occasionally &quot;tank&quot;, is a boss-like enemy weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level. Some minibosses are stronger versions of regular enemies, as in the &quot;Kirby&quot; games. Others may be a recurring version of a previous boss, who is either weaker than previously encountered or is less of a challenge later in the game due to character or equipment progression. An example is &quot;&quot;″s Gaibon and Slogra. Other video game characters who usually take the role of a miniboss are Vile (&quot;Mega Man X&quot; series), Allen O&#x27;Neil (&quot;Metal Slug&quot;) and Dark Link (&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series.

=== Superboss ===
A superboss is a type of boss most commonly found in role-playing video games. They are considered optional enemies and do not have to be defeated to complete the game. However, not all optional bosses are superbosses. They are generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game&#x27;s plot or quest, more difficult even than the final boss and often players are required to meet certain conditions in the game or complete a sidequest or the entire game to fight the superboss. The first such superboss (or secret boss) was Akuma in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, that required players meet certain conditions before he would appear as the final boss. In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, players may choose to seek out and fight the Ruby and Emerald Weapons. Some superbosses will take the place of the final boss if certain requirements are met. Some superbosses can yield special items or skills that cannot be found any other way that can give players a significant advantage during playthrough of the rest of the game, such as added experience or an extremely powerful weapon. For example, the &quot;raid bosses&quot; from &quot;Borderlands 2&quot; give rare loot unavailable anywhere else. Some superbosses in online games have an immense amount of health and must be defeated within a time limit by having a large number of players or parties working together to defeat the boss. Examples of such superbosses can be found in games like &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, and are generally referred to as a raid. Toby Fox&#x27;s games &quot;Undertale&quot; and &quot;Deltarune&quot; both feature superbosses in the form of Sans, Jevil, and Spamton NEO. Some major video game series have recurring superbosses such as the Ultima Weapon and Omega Weapon in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and the Amon clan in &quot;Yakuza&quot;. The Warden from &quot;Minecraft&quot; could be considered a superboss, as it is vastly more difficult to fight than the final boss, the Ender Dragon. However, Mojang, the developer of Minecraft, has explicitly stated that the Warden was not intended to be fought by players.

=== Wolfpack boss ===
A wolfpack boss is a group of enemies who may be considered weak on their own, but in large groups can be considered strong enough to be a boss. They come in many variations, such as the Chargin&#x27; Chuck Swarm encountered in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam&quot;, the Armos Knights from &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; or the Battle of 1000 Heartless from &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. A main requirement with most wolfpacks is that the whole group must be defeated in order to win; in order to prolong the fight, many wolfpacks, particularly in games with turn-based combat in lieu of real-time, will summon reinforcements to replenish their lost numbers. An example of this is Astaroth in &quot;Diablo IV&quot;. Many other wolfpack bosses empower themselves when one of the other enemies in the battle is killed to keep the threat level from falling over time. 

===Final boss===
The final boss, last boss or end boss, is typically present at or near the end of a game, with completion of the game&#x27;s storyline usually following victory in the battle. The final boss is usually the main antagonist of the game; however, there are exceptions, such as in &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, in which the final boss, Heinrich, is the alien pet of the antagonist, Professor Von Kriplespac. Final bosses are generally larger, more detailed or better animated than lesser enemies, often in order to inspire a feeling of grandeur and special significance from the encounter.

In some games, a hidden boss, referred to as the &quot;true&quot; final boss, is present. These bosses only appear after the completion of specific additional levels, choosing specific dialogue options or after obtaining a particular item or set of items, such as the Chaos Emeralds in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series or performing a series of tasks in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;. These bosses are generally more difficult to defeat. In games with a &quot;true&quot; final boss, victory leads to either a better ending or a more detailed version of the regular ending. Examples of a &quot;true final boss&quot; include the Radiance in &quot;Hollow Knight&quot; and the Moon Presence in &quot;Bloodborne&quot;.

The term &quot;Foozle&quot; is used to describe a cliché final boss that exists only to act as the final problem before players can complete the game. Scorpia stated in 1994 that &quot;about 98% of all role-playing video games can be summed up as follows: &#x27;We go out and bash on critters until we&#x27;re strong enough to go bash on Foozle.

==History==
A precursor to video game boss fights is Bruce Lee&#x27;s Hong Kong martial arts films, including &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971), in which Lee fights a criminal gang before battling the eponymous &quot;big boss&quot;, and &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972), where Lee fights a different boss on each level of a pagoda, which later inspired the boss battles of martial arts action games such as beat &#x27;em ups. Another precursor is tabletop role-playing games starting with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974), in which in a typical dungeon campaign there would be one powerful enemy acting as the boss of the weaker minions that players would face beforehand, in the same sense as a crime boss, which later inspired the boss battles of role-playing video games.

The first interactive video game to feature a boss was &quot;dnd&quot;, which was released in 1975 for the PLATO system. &quot;dnd&quot; was one of the earliest dungeon crawl video games and implemented many of the core concepts of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The objective of the game is to retrieve an &quot;Orb&quot; from the bottommost dungeon. The orb is kept in a treasure room guarded by a high-level enemy named the Gold Dragon. Only by defeating the Dragon can players claim the orb, complete the game and be eligible to appear on the high score list.

In 1980, boss battles appeared in several arcade action games. In March 1980, Sega released &quot;Samurai&quot;, a jidaigeki-themed martial arts action game where player samurai fight a number of swordspeople before confronting a more powerful boss samurai. SNK&#x27;s &quot;Sasuke vs. Commander&quot;, released in October 1980, is a ninja-themed shooting game where the player character fights enemy ninjas before confronting bosses with various ninjutsu attacks and enemy patterns. It was one of the earliest games with multiple boss encounters, and one of SNK&#x27;s earliest games. &quot;Phoenix&quot;, released in December 1980, is a fixed shooter where players&#x27;s ship must fight a giant mothership in the fifth and final level. At several points in Namco&#x27;s vertically scrolling shooter &quot;Xevious&quot; (1982), players must defeat an Andor Genesis mothership to advance.

In side-scrolling character action games such as beat &#x27;em ups, Irem&#x27;s 1984 arcade game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; established the end-of-level boss battle structure used in these games, with players progressing through levels (represented by floors of a temple) and fighting a boss character at the end of each level; in turn, this end-of-level boss battle structure was adapted from the Bruce Lee film &quot;Game of Death&quot;, where Lee&#x27;s character fights a different boss character on each floor as he ascends a pagoda. The game was distinctive for giving both players and each boss a health meter, which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one-on-one fighting game during boss battles, a concept that &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; designer Takashi Nishiyama later expanded on when he created the fighting game &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987) at Capcom. The term &quot;boss&quot; was used in reference to the game&#x27;s final boss by Mike Roberts in a review of the game published in the May 1985 issue of British magazine &quot;Computer Gamer&quot;, while he used the term &quot;super baddies&quot; for the end-of-level bosses.

Sega&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; (1986) popularized the concept of a boss rush, a stage where players face multiple previous bosses again in succession.

===Etymology===

Michael Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted in a podcast that usage of the term &quot;boss&quot; by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; grew sharply around 1988, and that there was no clear single etymology of the term. In the same podcast, former &quot;Kotaku&quot; editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo speculated that bosses became known as such because they were &quot;in charge of all the enemies&quot;.

<text>Tsathoggua (the &quot;Sleeper of N&#x27;kai&quot;, also known as Zhothaqquah) is a supernatural entity in the Cthulhu Mythos shared fictional universe. He is the creation of American writer Clark Ashton Smith and is part of his Hyperborean cycle.

Tsathoggua/Zhothaqquah is described as an Old One, a god-like being from the pantheon. He was introduced in Smith&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tale of Satampra Zeiros&quot;, written in 1929 and published in the November 1931 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. His first appearance in print, however, was in Robert E. Howard&#x27;s story &quot;The Children of the Night&quot;, written in 1930 and published in the April–May 1931 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. His next appearance in print was in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;, written in 1930 and published in the August 1931 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

==Description==
The first description of Tsathoggua occurs in &quot;The Tale of Satampra Zeiros&quot;, in which the protagonists encounter one of the entity&#x27;s idols:

Later, in Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Geases&quot; (1933), Tsathoggua is described again:


Robert M. Price notes that &quot;Lovecraft&#x27;s Tsathoggua and Smith&#x27;s differ at practically every point&quot;. Lovecraft, dropping Smith&#x27;s bat and sloth comparisons, refers to the entity in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; as the &quot;amorphous, toad-like god-creature mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and the Commoriom myth-cycle preserved by the Atlantean high-priest Klarkash-Ton&quot; (the priest&#x27;s name was Lovecraft&#x27;s nickname for Tsathoggua&#x27;s creator, Clark Ashton Smith).

Later, in &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot;, a story ghost-written by Lovecraft, he writes,

He also mentions it in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, in a paragraph mentioning several other gods.

==Servitors==

===Formless spawn===
The basin ... was filled with a sort of viscous and semi-liquescent substance, quite opaque and of a sooty color... [T]he center swelled as if with the action of some powerful yeast [and] an uncouth amorphous head with dull and bulging eyes arose gradually on an ever-lengthening neck ... Then two arms—if one could call them arms—likewise arose inch by inch, and we saw that the thing was not ... a creature immersed in the liquid, but that the liquid itself had put forth this hideous neck and head, and [it was now forming arms] that groped toward us with tentacle-like appendages in lieu of claws or hands! ... Then the whole mass of the dark fluid began to rise [and] poured over the rim of the basin like a torrent of black quicksilver, taking as it reached the floor an undulant ophidian form which immediately developed more than a dozen short legs.
:—Clark Ashton Smith, &quot;The Tale of Satampra Zeiros&quot;

Tsathoggua&#x27;s will is carried out by the &quot;formless spawn&quot;, entities made of black ichor. They are extremely resilient and very difficult to dispatch. Formless spawn can take any shape and can attack their targets in nearly every conceivable way. They are surprisingly flexible and plastic, and can quickly flow into a room through the tiniest of cracks. They attack by trampling their targets, biting them, or crushing them with their grasp. The &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; roleplaying game&#x27;s entry on Formless Spawn also claims that they are powerfully acidic in substance and can dissolve human flesh with even a slight touch.

Formless spawn often rest in basins in Tsathoggua&#x27;s temples and keep the sanctuary from being defiled by nonbelievers.

In &quot;The Mound&quot; the people of the subterranean world of K&#x27;N-Yan had once worshipped Tsathoggua until a scientific expedition exploring N&#x27;Kai encountered the Formless Spawn. Those who escaped had all the images of Tsathoggua destroyed, and his temple re-dedicated to Shub-Niggurath.

In his story &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, H. P. Lovecraft states that &quot;[a] few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself&quot;

The formless spawn appear as adversaries in the video game &quot;Quake&quot;.

===Voormis===
A race of cave-dwelling humanoids who worship Tsathoggua. They are the primary focus of a &quot;posthumous collaboration&quot; short story by Lin Carter after Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s death, &quot;The Scroll of Morloc&quot; (First published in 1976, &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy Stories: 2&quot;, and again in 1980 in &quot;Lost Worlds&quot;). They are referred to as the Voormi (plural: Voormis) in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional manuscript The Pnakotic Fragments. The Voormis considered themselves the chosen minions of Tsathoggua and his direct descendants.

The Voormis are described as three-toed, umber-colored, fur-covered humanoids though they are carefully differentiated from their traditional enemies (the shaggier-haired but superficially similar Gnophkehs who worshiped the Great Old One Rhan-Tegoth). Both of them are further differentiated from true humans. The Voormis communicate by dog-like howls.

They reside in a continent in Hyperborea which will be known in the future as Mhu Thulan: specifically in cave systems under the four-coned extinct volcano named after them—Mount Voormithadreth, the tallest peak in the Eiglophian mountains. Their ancestors (as described by Carter&#x27;s narrative) were originally thralls of the Serpent-people who escaped after the continent of the latter sank to the sea. They are shamanistic and apparently began dwelling underground in an effort to imitate their deity, Tsathoggua, under the leadership of the eponymous Voorm.

The Voormis established a thriving culture in the surface Hyperborea before the coming of humans. Their civilization eventually fell into demise. With constant warfare with their archenemies, the Gnophkeh, they grew smaller and smaller in number until the remnants retreated to the highest slopes of the Eiglophian mountains. They were hunted for sport by later human settlers.

==Family tree==
Smith literally wed Lovecraft&#x27;s creations to his own gods, which seem to be molded more like the Greek pantheon than the cosmic group of Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction. He assigned familial relationships to his gods—for example, making the Saturnian being Hziulquoigmnzhah the &quot;uncle&quot; of Tsathoggua—and ascribed this family tree to the Parchments of Pnom, Hyperborea&#x27;s leading &quot;genealogist [and] noted prophet&quot;.

According to Smith&#x27;s &quot;Parchments of Pnom&quot;, Tsathoggua is the spawn of Ghisguth and Zystulzhemgni, as well as being the mate of Shathak and the parent of Zvilpogghua. Lovecraft, however, states that Tsathoggua is the offspring of the deity Yeb, whose twin Nug spawned Cthulhu.

===Cxaxukluth===
Cxaxukluth (or Ksaksa-Kluth) is an Outer God, spawn of Azathoth by spontaneous fission. His progeny are Hziulquoigmnzhah and Ghisguth. He is the grandfather of Tsathoggua.

Cxaxukluth dwells on Yuggoth. His immediate family lived with him for a while, but soon left because of his cannibalistic appetites.

===Ghisguth===
Ghisguth (or Ghizghuth or Ghisghuth) is the son of Cxaxukluth and the brother of Hziulquoigmnzhah. He is the mate of Zstylzhemghi and the father of Tsathoggua.

===Hziulquoigmnzhah===
Hziulquoigmnzhah (also Ziulquaz-Manzah) is the son of Cxaxukluth. He is also the brother to Ghisguth and the uncle of Tsathoggua.

His appearance is much like his nephew, but he has an elongated neck, very long forelimbs, and very short, multiple legs. He has had many homes including Xoth (possibly Sirius B), Yaksh (Neptune), and Cykranosh (Saturn), where he resides to this day.

In Kevin L. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;October Surprise&quot; (2006) Hziulquoigmnzhah&#x27;s mate is Zstylzhemghi&#x27;s sister Klosmiebhyx who bore him two entities likely matching with the Welsh giant Ysbaddaden and the Scottish war-goddess Scáthach, since both named after these two demigods.

===Klosmiebhyx===

Klosmiebhyx is mentioned in Kevin L. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;October Surprise&quot; (2006) as sister of Zstylzhemghi. Her appearance is not described, but likely similar to her sibling.

===Knygathin Zhaum===

Knygathin Zhaum is the child of Sfatlicllp and a Voormi.

He repopulated Hyperborea after humans deserted the cities of Uzuldaroum and Commoriom. Athammaus tried to execute him by beheading, but because of his preternatural heritage, such attempts proved unsuccessful and only served to aggravate him. As a descendant of Cxaxukluth, Knygathin Zhaum reproduced by fission and thus created an Azathothian strain among the Hyperborean Voormi.

===Sfatlicllp===
Sfatlicllp is the daughter of Zvilpogghua. She is the wife of a Voormi and their offspring is Knygathin Zhaum.

Sfatlicllp was likely born on Kythanil and may have procreated the &quot;formless spawn&quot; once on Earth. She probably dwells in N&#x27;kai with Tsathoggua.

===Shathak===
Shathak is the wife of Tsathoggua and the mother of Zvilpogghua.

===Ycnágnnisssz===

Ycnágnnisssz is the being from the dark star Xoth who spawned Zstylzhemghi by fission.

===Zstylzhemghi===
Zstylzhemghi (&quot;Matriarch of the Swarm&quot;) is the offspring of Ycnagnnisssz along with Klosmiebhyx, mate of Ghisguth and the mother of Tsathoggua.

===Zvilpogghua===
Zvilpogghua (the &quot;Feaster from the Stars&quot;) is the son of Tsathoggua and Shathak, and is the father of Sfatlicllp. Zvilpogghua was conceived on the planet Yaksh (Neptune).

Zvilpogghua is known to the American Indians as &quot;Ossadagowah&quot;. He usually takes the form of an armless, winged, bipedal toad with a long, rubbery neck and a face completely covered in tentacles. He currently dwells on Yrautrom, a planet that orbits the star Algol.

==Other appearances==

In 1971, Tsathoggua&#x27;s idol, which came to life and attacked Conan the Barbarian, made a cameo in &quot;Conan the Buccaneer&quot;, book 6 of the Conan series, this novel written by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter based on the Conan character created by Robert E. Howard.

In 1975, Tsathoggua made a cameo in &quot;The Golden Apple&quot;, book two of &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, where he was also referred to as Saint Toad.

In 2008, the short story &quot;Tsathoggua&quot; by Michael Shea was first published in &quot;The Autopsy and Other Tales&quot;.

In 2013, Tsathoggua played a pivotal role in &quot;Gray Magic: An Episode of Eibon&quot;, a novel by Gary Myers based on the Eibon character and Hyperborean cycle created by Clark Ashton Smith.

The mind parasites are called the Tsathogguans in Colin Wilson&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos–based novel &quot;The Mind Parasites&quot; (1967).

Tsathoggua is also a summonable unit in the 2016 Japanese mobile game &quot;Tokyo Afterschool Summoners&quot;, where he&#x27;s depicted as a proud shut-in NEET dwelling in the VIP room of an underground casino in Roppongi, Tokyo.

==&quot;The Tsathoggua Cycle&quot;==

In 2005, Chaosium published a Cthulhu Mythos anthology edited by Robert M. Price called &quot;The Tsathoggua Cycle&quot;, which comprised the original Clark Ashton Smith stories featuring Tsathoggua, along with tales by other authors in which the entity has a starring role.

<doc id="249433" wikidata="Q81665" url="?curid=249433" title="Political parties in the United States">
<text>American electoral politics have been dominated by successive pairs of major political parties since shortly after the founding of the republic of the United States. Since the 1850s, the two largest political parties have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party—which together have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856. Despite keeping the same names, the two parties have evolved in terms of ideologies, positions, and support bases over their long lifespans, in response to social, cultural, and economic developmentsthe Democratic Party being the left-of-center party since the time of the New Deal, and the Republican Party now being the right-of-center party.

Political parties are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, which predates the party system. The two-party system is based on laws, party rules, and custom. Several third parties also operate in the U.S. and occasionally have a member elected to local office; some of the larger ones include the Constitution, Green, Alliance, and Libertarian parties, with the latter being the largest third party since the 1980s. A small number of members of the U.S. Congress, a larger number of political candidates, and a good many voters (35–45%) have no party affiliation. However, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, and members of Congress with no political party affiliation caucus to pursue common legislative objectives with either the Democrats or Republicans.

The need to win popular support in a republic led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s. Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.
Political scientists and historians have divided the development of America&#x27;s two-party system into six or so eras or &quot;party systems&quot;, starting with the Federalist Party, which supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the Anti-Administration party (Anti-Federalists), which opposed a powerful central government and later became the Democratic-Republican Party.

==History and political eras==


===Founding Fathers===
The subject of political parties is not mentioned in the United States Constitution. The Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In Federalist No. 9 and No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. In addition, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was not a member of any political party at the time of his election nor throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not form, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his Farewell Address. Historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that the Founders &quot;did not believe in parties as such, scorned those that they were conscious of as historical models, had a keen terror of party spirit and its evil consequences&quot;, but &quot;almost as soon as their national government was in operation, [they] found it necessary to establish parties.&quot;

Since their creation in the 1800s, the two dominant parties have changed their ideologies and bases of support considerably, while maintaining their names. In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, the Democratic party was an agrarian, pro-states-rights, anti-civil rights, pro-easy money, anti-tariff, anti-bank coalition of Jim Crow Solid South and Western small farmers. Budding labor unions and Catholic immigrants were the primary participants in the Democratic party of the time. During the same period, the dominant Republican party was composed of large and small business owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, professionals, and freed African Americans, based especially in the industrial northeast.

By the start of the 21st-century, the Democratic party had shifted to become a left-wing party, disproportionately composed of women, LGBT people, union members, and urban, educated, younger, non-white voters. At the same time, the Republican party had shifted to become a right-wing party, disproportionately composed of family business, older, rural, southern, religious, and white working-class voters. Along with this realignment, political and ideological polarization increased and norms deteriorated, leading to greater tension and &quot;deadlocks&quot; in attempts to pass ideologically controversial bills.

===First Party System: 1792–1824 (Federalist vs Democratic-Republican)===

The beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from George Washington&#x27;s immediate circle of advisers, which included Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. Hamilton and Madison wrote against political factions in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; (1788), but by the 1790s, differing views concerning the course of the new country had developed, and people who held these views tried to win support for their cause by banding together.

Followers of Hamilton&#x27;s ideology took up the name &quot;Federalist&quot;; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry and close ties to Britain. Followers of the ideology of Madison and Thomas Jefferson, initially referred to as &quot;Anti-Federalists&quot;, became known as Republicans, which for clarity&#x27;s sake is today called the &quot;Democratic-Republicans&quot;; they preferred a decentralized agrarian republic in which the federal government had limited power.

The Jeffersonians came to power in 1800. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the War of 1812 verged on secession and was a devastating blow to the party when the war ended well. The Era of Good Feelings under President James Monroe (1816–1824) marked the end of the First Party System and was a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.

===Second Party System: 1828–1854 (Democratic vs Whig)===

By 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, and Andrew Jackson&#x27;s presidency split the Democratic-Republican Party: &quot;Jacksonians&quot; became the Democratic Party, while those following the leadership of John Quincy Adams became the National Republican Party (unrelated to the later Republican Party). After the 1832 election, opponents of Jackson—primarily National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and others—coalesced into the Whig Party led by Henry Clay. This marked the return of the two-party political system, but with different parties.

The early Democratic Party stood for individual rights and state rights, supported the primacy of the Presidency (executive branch) over the other branches of government, and opposed banks (namely the Bank of the United States), high tariffs, and modernizing programs that they felt would build up industry at the expense of farmers. It styled itself as the party of the &quot;common man&quot;. Presidents Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James K. Polk were all Democrats who defeated Whig candidates, but by narrow margins. Jackson&#x27;s populist appeal and campaigning inspired a tradition of not just voting for a Democrat, but identifying as a Democrat; in this way, political parties were becoming a feature of social life, not just politics.

The Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the supremacy of Congress over the executive branch, as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the Bank War and the spoils system of federal patronage. Presidents William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor were both Whig candidates.

In the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country&#x27;s new territories in the West. The Whig Party attempted to straddle the issue with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, where the status of slavery would be decided based on popular sovereignty (i.e. the citizens of each territory, rather than Congress, would determine whether slavery would be allowed). The Whig Party sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the 1852 presidential election. Ex-Whigs joined the Know Nothing party or the newly formed, anti-slavery Republican Party. While the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years later, this new party captured the presidency when Abraham Lincoln won the election of 1860. This election marked the beginning of the Democratic and Republican parties as the major parties of America.

===Third Party System: 1854–1890s (Democratic vs Republican)===

The anti-slavery Republican Party emerged in 1854. It adopted many of the economic policies of the Whigs, such as national banks, railroads, high tariffs, homesteads, and aid to land grant colleges.

After the defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War, the Republican Party became the dominant party in America for decades, associated with the successful military defense of the Union and often known as the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; (GOP). The Republican coalition consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party&#x27;s modernization policies and newly enfranchised African Americans (freedmen).

The Democratic Party was usually in opposition during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives or both.
The Democrats were known as &quot;basically conservative and agrarian-oriented&quot;, and like the Republicans, the Democrats were a broad-based voting coalition. Democratic support came from the Redeemers of the Jim Crow &quot;Solid South&quot; (i.e. solidly Democratic), where &quot;repressive legislation and physical intimidation [were] designed to prevent newly enfranchised African Americans from voting&quot;. Further Democratic support came from small farmers in the West before the Sun Belt boom. Both regions were much less populated than the North, yet politically powerful. Additional Democratic voters included conservative pro-business Bourbon Democrats, traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former Copperheads), and Catholic immigrants.

As the party of states&#x27; rights, post-Civil War Democrats opposed civil rights legislation. As the (sometimes) populist party of small farmers, it opposed the interests of big business, such as protective tariffs that raised prices on imported goods needed by rural people. The party favored cheap-money policies, including low interest rates and inflation favoring those with substantial debts, such as small farmers.

Civil War and Reconstruction issues polarized the parties until the Compromise of 1877, which saw the withdrawal of the last federal troops from the Southern United States. (By 1905 most black people were effectively disenfranchised in every Southern state.)

During the post-Civil War era of the nineteenth century, parties were well-established as the country&#x27;s dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people&#x27;s consciousness. Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and in an era before motion pictures and radio, party activities, including spectacular campaign events complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communities.

===Fourth Party System: 1896–1932 (Democratic vs Republican)===

1896 saw the beginning of the Progressive Era. The Republican Party still dominated and the interest groups and voting blocs were unchanged, but the central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (&quot;trusts&quot;), the protective tariff, the role of labor unions, child labor, the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, racial segregation, efficiency in government, women&#x27;s suffrage, and control of immigration.

Some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states.

The era began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the Panic of 1893, which later resulted in William McKinley&#x27;s victory over William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election.

===Fifth Party System: 1932–1976 (Democratic vs Republican)===
The disruption and suffering of the Great Depression (1929–1939), and the New Deal programs (1933–39) of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to deal with it, created a dramatic political shift. The Democrats were now the party of &quot;big government&quot;, the dominant party (retaining the presidency until 1952 and controlling both houses of Congress for most of the period from the 1930s to the mid-1990s), and positioned towards liberalism while conservatives increasingly dominated the GOP.

The New Deal raised the minimum wage, established Social Security, and created other federal services. Roosevelt &quot;forged a broad coalition—including small farmers, Northern city dwellers with &#x27;urban political machines&#x27;, organized labor, European immigrants, Catholics, Jews, African Americans, liberals, intellectuals, and reformers&quot;, as well as traditionally Democratic segregationist white Southerners.

Opposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as Nelson Rockefeller, Jacob Javits, and Henry Cabot Lodge. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.

Civil rights legislation driven by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, along with Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign and later President Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Southern strategy&quot;, began the breaking of white segregationist Solid South away from the Democratic Party and their migration towards the Republican Party. Southern white voters started voting for Republican presidential candidates in the 1950s, and Republican state and local candidates in the 1990s.

Anti-Vietnam War protests alienated conservative Democrats from the protesters. The &quot;religious right&quot; emerged as a wing of the Republican Party, made up of Catholics and Evangelical Protestants who, until this point, were usually strongly opposed, but now united in opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. Increased political polarization was the trend; county caucuses and state conventions were gradually replaced with political primaries, wherein the party base could defeat moderate candidates who appealed to general election voters but were disliked by the party base.

===Sixth Party System: 1976–2016 (Democratic vs Republican)===

Around 1968, a breakup of the old Democratic Party New Deal coalition began and American politics became more polarized along ideology. The following decades saw the dissipation of the blurred ideological character of political party coalitions. Previously, there were Democratic elected officials (mostly in the South) who were considerably more conservative than many Republican senators and governors (for example, Nelson Rockefeller). Even Jimmy Carter, who ultimately served as a transitional President in the wake of the Nixon scandals, was considered by many at the time to possibly be a closet boll weevil Democrat.

In time, not only did conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans retire, switch parties, or lose elections, so did centrists (such as Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki, Richard Riordan, and Arnold Schwarzenegger).

Eventually a large nationwide majority of rural and working-class whites became the base of the Republican Party,
while the Democratic Party was increasingly made up of a coalition of African Americans, Latinos, and white urban progressives. Whereas college-educated voters had historically skewed heavily towards the Republican party, high educational attainment was increasingly a marker of Democratic support. Together, this formed the political system in the Reagan Era of the 1980s and beyond.

In 1980, conservative Republican Ronald Reagan defeated incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter on a platform of smaller government and sunny optimism that free trade and tax cuts would stimulate economic growth, which would then &quot;trickle down&quot; to the middle and lower classes (who might not benefit initially from these policies). The Republican Party was now said to rest on &quot;three legs&quot;: Christian right social conservatism (particularly the anti-abortion movement), fiscal conservatism and small government (particularly supporting tax cuts), and strong anti-communist military policy (with increased willingness to intervene abroad).

===(proposed) Seventh Party System: 2016?–present (Democratic vs Republican)===

While there is no consensus that a Seventh Party System has begun, many have noted unique features of a political era starting with the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump.

During and following the campaign, &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; rhetoric and policy began to be replaced by new themes in the Republican Party. There was more emphasis on cultural conservatism (opposition not just to abortion, but also gay marriage and transgender rights). Additionally, support for free trade and liberal immigration was replaced by opposition to economic globalization and immigration from non-European countries. Distrust of institutions and loyalty for President Donald Trump became common among Republican voters during this time.

Although conservative blue-collar workers migrated to the Republican Party, an upper business class, historically part of the Republican Party since the Gilded Age, began moving left. According to Ross Douthat, &quot;Today’s G.O.P. is most clearly now the party of &quot;local&quot; capitalism—the small-business gentry, the family firms&quot;, while &quot;much of corporate America has swung culturally into liberalism’s camp. [...] The party’s base regards corporate institutions—especially in Silicon Valley, but extending to more traditional capitalist powers—as cultural enemies&quot;.

==Minor parties and independents==

Although American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, third political parties have appeared from time to time in American history, but seldom lasted more than a decade. They have sometimes been the vehicle of an individual (as in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Bull Moose&quot; party, and Ross Perot&#x27;s Reform Party); had considerable strength in particular regions (such as the Socialist Party, Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota, Wisconsin Progressive Party, Conservative Party of New York State, and Populist Party); or continued to run candidates for office to publicize ideas despite seldom winning even local elections (Libertarian Party, Natural Law Party, Peace and Freedom Party).

The oldest third party was the Anti-Masonic Party, which was formed in upstate New York in 1828. The party&#x27;s creators feared the Freemasons, believing they were a powerful secret society that was attempting to rule the country in defiance of republican principles. By 1840, the party had been supplanted by the Whig Party.

Some other significant but unsuccessful parties that ran a candidate for president include: the Know Nothing or American Party (1844–1860), the People&#x27;s Party (Populist) candidate James B. Weaver (1892), Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive or &quot;Bull Moose party&quot; (1912), Robert M. La Follette&#x27;s Progressive Party (1924), Strom Thurmond&#x27;s Dixiecrat States Rights Party (1948), Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s Progressive Party (1948), George Wallace&#x27;s American Independent Party (1968), and Ross Perot running as an Independent (1992).

==Organization of American political parties==
American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, and the Democratic and Republican parties have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership. Thus, for example, in many states the process to determine a party&#x27;s candidate for office is a public election (a political primary) open to all who have signed up as affiliated with that party when they register to vote, not just those who donate money and are active in the party.

Party identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and one&#x27;s intention to enter that party&#x27;s primary election for office. A party committee may choose to endorse candidate(s) seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who will be voting.

The result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. Unlike in many countries, the party leadership cannot prevent a person who disagrees with basic principles and positions of the party, or actively works against the party&#x27;s aims, from claiming party membership, so long as primary election voters elect that person. Once in office, elected officials who fail to &quot;toe the party line&quot; because of constituent opposition to it, and &quot;cross the aisle&quot; to vote with the opposition, have (relatively) little to fear from their party. An elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent.

At the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties, affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party.

Both parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the &quot;Hill committees&quot;, which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress.

State parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state level.

Despite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties. In what is known as &quot;presidential coattails&quot;, candidates in presidential elections become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn vote for the party&#x27;s candidates for other offices. On the other hand, federal midterm elections (where only Congress, and not the president, is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president&#x27;s performance, with voters either voting in or out the president&#x27;s party&#x27;s candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president&#x27;s agenda, respectively.

=== The two-party system in the U.S. ===
As noted above, the modern political party system in the United States has traditionally been dominated by two parties, with the parties being the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Explanations for why America has a two-party system include: 
*The traditional American electoral format of single-member districts where the candidate with the most votes wins (&quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system), which according to Duverger&#x27;s law favors the two-party system. This is in contrast to multi-seat electoral districts and proportional representation found in some other democracies.
* The 19th-century innovation of printing &quot;party tickets&quot; to pass out to prospective voters to cast in ballot boxes (originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported), &quot;consolidated the power of the major parties&quot;.
*Printed &quot;party tickets&quot; were eventually replaced by uniform ballots provided by the state, when states began to adopt the Australian Secret Ballot Method. This gave state legislatures—dominated by Democrats and Republicans—the opportunity to handicap new rising parties with ballot access laws requiring a large number of petition signatures from citizens and giving the petitioners a short length of time to gather the signatures.

Political scientist Nelson W. Polsby argued in 1997 that the lack of central control of the parties in America means they have become as much &quot;labels&quot; to mobilize voters as political organizations, and that &quot;variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences&quot;, suggesting that &quot;the American two-party system&quot; actually masks &quot;something more like a hundred-party system.&quot; Other political scientists, such as Lee Drutman and Daniel J. Hopkins in 2018, argued that in the 21st century, along with becoming overly partisan, America politics has become overly focused on national issues and &quot;nationalized&quot;.

== Major parties ==


===Democratic Party===

The Democratic Party is one of two major political parties in the U.S. Founded as the Democratic Party in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, it is the oldest extant voter-based political party in the world.

Since 1912, the Democratic Party has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which has strongly influenced modern American liberalism, has shaped much of the party&#x27;s agenda since 1932. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal coalition controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of President Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961. Until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. Following the Great Society under Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democratic Party became a more progressive party on issues of civil rights, and would slowly lose dominance in southern states until 1996. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been on the center-left and supported social justice, social liberalism, a mixed economy, and the welfare state; Bill Clinton and other New Democrats have pushed for free trade and neoliberalism, which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards.

Into the 21st century, Democrats are strongest in the Northeast, West Coast, and major American urban centers. African Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do trade unions. In 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of a total 169 million registered) claiming affiliation. Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, Barack Obama would later go on to become president in 2009 and stay president until January 2017. Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and, from the 2006 midterm elections until the 2014 midterm elections, the Democratic Party was also the majority party in the United States Senate. A 2011 &quot;USA Today&quot; review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise. In 2011, the number of Democrats shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%. In 2018, the Democratic Party was the largest in the United States with roughly 60 million registered members.

===Republican Party===
The Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States. Since the 1880s, it has been nicknamed by the media the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party. Founded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln, who used the party machinery to support victory in the American Civil War.

The GOP dominated national politics during the Third Party System from 1854 to 1896 and the Fourth Party System from 1896 to 1932. Since the early 20th century, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests. As a party whose power was once based on the support of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more robust national defense measures and improved veterans&#x27; benefits. Until 2016, the Republican Party supported an American conservative platform, with further foundations in economic liberalism, fiscal conservatism, and social conservatism. The election of Donald Trump, however, signaled a shift in the Republican party towards a more populist and isolationist orientation.

The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the Southern United States, outside large metropolitan areas, or in less-centralized, lower-density parts of them. Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives from the 2010 midterm elections until the 2018 midterms, when they lost it to the Democratic Party. Additionally, from the 2014 elections to the 2020 elections, the Republican Party controlled the Senate. In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States. In the aftermath of the 2020 United States elections, the GOP lost their Senate majority, and Democrat Chuck Schumer was appointed Senate Majority Leader in a power-sharing agreement with the Republican Party.

==Minor parties==
The United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of voter registrations ) are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties. (There are many other political parties that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.) 
===Libertarian Party===

The Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1972. it is the largest third party in the United States, claiming nearly 700,000 registered voters across 28 states and the District of Columbia. it has 309 local elected officials, and one state representative: Marshall Burt of Wyoming. Former Representative Justin Amash, a former Republican and later independent from Michigan, switched to the Libertarian Party in May 2020, becoming the first Libertarian Party member of Congress. Amash declined to run for reelection in 2020 and left office on January 3, 2021.

The 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, Gary Johnson. He achieved ballot access in every state except for Michigan (only as a write-in candidate) and Oklahoma. He received over one million votes in the election. In 2016, Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.

The Libertarian Party&#x27;s core platform is the reduction of the size, influence, and expenditures in all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful federal government, strong civil liberties, drug liberalization, open immigration, non-interventionism, neutrality in diplomatic relations, free trade, free movement to all foreign countries, and a transition to a more representative republic.

===Green Party===

The Green Party has been active as a third party since the 1980s. The party first gained widespread public attention during Ralph Nader&#x27;s second presidential run in 2000. Currently, the primary national Green Party organization in the U.S. is the Green Party of the United States, which split from and eclipsed the earlier Greens/Green Party USA.

The Green Party in the United States has won elected office mostly at the local level; most winners of public office in the United States who are considered Greens have won nonpartisan-ballot elections (that is, elections in which the candidates&#x27; party affiliations were not printed on the ballot). In 2005, the Party had 305,000 registered members in the District of Columbia and 20 states that allow party registration. During the 2006 elections, the party had ballot access in 31 states. In 2017, Ralph Chapman, a Representative in the Maine House of Representatives, switched his association from Unaffiliated to the Green Independent Party.

The Green Party of the United States generally holds a left-wing ideology on most important issues. Greens emphasize environmentalism, non-hierarchical participatory democracy, social justice, respect for diversity, peace, and nonviolence. , it is the fourth largest political party in the United States based on voter registration.

===Constitution Party===

The Constitution Party is a national conservative political party in the United States. It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party&#x27;s official name was changed to the &quot;Constitution Party&quot; in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names. , it is the fifth largest political party in the United States based on voter registration.

===Alliance Party===
The Alliance Party is a centrist American political party that was formed in 2018 and registered in 2019. The Alliance Party gained affiliation status with multiple other parties, including the American Party of South Carolina, the Independence Party of Minnesota, and the Independent Party of Connecticut. During the 2020 presidential elections, Alliance Party Presidential Candidate Roque De La Fuente placed fifth in terms of the popular vote. Following the presidential election, the American Delta Party and the Independence Party of New York joined the Alliance Party. The Independence Party of New York disaffiliated in 2021.

===Vermont Progressive Party===
The Vermont Progressive Party is a political party that is active in Vermont and is the third largest party in the state, behind the Democratic and Republican parties. Despite operating only in one state, the Vermont Progressives, as of November 2024, have managed to have more of its candidates elected as state legislators than all other third parties in the United States. By this standard, the Progressives are the third largest party in the United States, not just in Vermont. As of November 2024, the Forward Party is the only other third party with state legislators, having two Pennsylvania State Senate members. The Progressives are notable for reliably electing candidates to office and in some areas, such as the Burlington City Council, have previously held a majority in recent years.

== Alternative interpretations ==
Multiple individuals from various stances have proposed an end to the two-party system, arguing mostly that the Democratic and Republican parties don&#x27;t accurately represent much of the national electorate, or that multiple political parties already exist within the Democratic and Republican parties, which encompass a variety of views.

=== Four-party interpretations ===
NBC News&#x27; Dante Chinni and &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Perry Bacon Jr. have both suggested that the United States&#x27; political system is that of four parties grouped into a two-party system. Due mostly to competing influence from larger personalities within such parties, Chinni and Bacon have grouped the American populace into four primary political parties:

* Trump Republicans, which includes Donald Trump&#x27;s followers, Ron DeSantis, the Christian right, and Fox News. In light of President Biden&#x27;s 2020 win, this group has been seen as the least willing to compromise with Biden and the most likely to believe the 2020 election was stolen.
* Party Republicans, or &quot;the Old Guard&quot;, consisting of Trump-skeptical and anti-Trump Republicans such as Mitch McConnell, Mitt Romney, and Larry Hogan. This group&#x27;s intention is focused on preserving the traditional Republican agenda of lifting regulations and cutting taxes.
* Moderate Democrats, composed of Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Eric Adams, some members of the Never Trump movement, and the Third Way movement. This group is currently the strongest and prefers to pass a moderate Democratic agenda.
* Left-wing Democrats, the most likely to embrace progressive politics and who are more willing to hinder Biden&#x27;s agenda in favor of more leftward policies. This faction&#x27;s leaders include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Pramila Jayapal, and the Progressive Caucus.

=== Six-party interpretations ===
The idea the United States primarily falls into six political parties is argued for by American political theorists Lee Drutman and Carl Davidson and former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. Drutman argues that government without two parties would enable and support &quot;the shifting alliances and bargaining that are essential in democracy&quot; which have largely been lost in a two-party system due to political gridlock. Reich further predicts that these parties likely emerge as the two parties &quot;explode&quot;.

All three theorists have consensus that these four parties will exist within a six-party system:

* One party would be founded on hard-line supporters of Donald Trump, his namesake grouping of ideas, economic nationalism, and right-wing populism. 
* Establishment Republicans would be composed of socially moderate but pro-business (Rockefeller-style) Republicans, corporations, and existing GOP megadonors who aspire to cut their taxes. Both Reich and Davidson attribute this to be the party of big business, and cite ExxonMobil and other Big Oil companies in particular as examples.
* Christian nationalists and Christian conservatives would form their own voting bloc. Davidson notes that the Koch family and Betsy DeVos are major backers of this segment of the populace.
* American progressives would form a bloc which would push an agenda advocating for social justice, full LGBTQ rights, ending crony capitalism, and fighting climate change. Those who identify as socialist within the American political system would be core members. Its funding base is primarily unions and grassroots donations.
The three interpretations, however, differ on the inclusion of these parties:
* Reich views libertarians, and the Tea Party and Freedom Caucus movements, as anti-establishment Republicans who aspire to shrink government and also end crony capitalism. Drutman views these groups as split between the party of Trumpism and Christian conservatives, and Davidson views the Tea Party and Freedom Caucus as the foundations for his Christian nationalists party.
* Drutman outlines another party which aims to represent working-class democrats who are as economically liberal, but not as socially liberal, as American progressives.
* Davidson splits moderate Democrats into two parties: the first is named for the Blue Dog Coalition and aligns more so with United Steelworkers and the pharmaceutical industry, while the other represents mainstream Democrats and is symbolized by Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Hollywood personalities, and large banks like JPMorgan Chase. Drutman and Reich, however, categorize both as &quot;Establishment Democrats&quot; who prefer tax cuts but also back equal rights.

==Ballot-qualified political parties by state==
&quot;As of June 2024&quot;

&quot;Notes:&quot; 
==Independents (unaffiliated)==
Some political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, Independents are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election that they choose. Although the term &quot;Independent&quot; often is used as a synonym for &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;centrist&quot;, or &quot;swing voter&quot; to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to Vox Media.

As of August 2024, five independents serve in the U.S. Congress: Senators Angus King, Bernie Sanders, Bob Menendez, Joe Manchin, and Kyrsten Sinema. GovTrack ranks King among the more moderate members of the Senate, near the Senate&#x27;s ideological center. Sanders describes himself as a &quot;democratic socialist&quot;, but sought nomination by the Democratic Party as their candidate for president in 2016; his political platform is said to &quot;define&quot; the &quot;progressive wing&quot; of the Democratic Party.

According to Ballotpedia, as of 2022, there were 24 seats held by independents in state legislatures (in Wyoming, Vermont, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Maine, Louisiana, California, Arkansas, and Alaska), and 10 seats held by third parties (in Vermont, Maine, New York, and Wyoming; seven seats by the Vermont Progressive Party, and one each for the Independent for Maine Party, Independence Party, and Libertarian Party).

<doc id="249440" wikidata="Q577559" url="?curid=249440" title="Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)">
<text>The Grand Alliance, sometimes erroneously referred to as its precursor the League of Augsburg, was formed on 20 December 1689. Signed by William III on behalf of the Dutch Republic and England, and Emperor Leopold I for the Habsburg Monarchy, its primary purpose was to oppose the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France.

With the later additions of Spain and Savoy, the coalition fought the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War against France that ended with the Peace of Ryswick.

The Second Grand Alliance was reformed by the 1701 Treaty of The Hague prior to the War of the Spanish Succession, and dissolved in 1713 following the Peace of Utrecht.

==Background==
The Grand Alliance was the most significant of the coalitions formed in response to the wars of Louis XIV that began in 1667 and ended in 1714. Post-1648, French expansion was helped by the decline of Spanish power while the Peace of Westphalia formalised religious divisions within the Holy Roman Empire. This weakened the collective security previously provided by the Imperial Circles and led to a series of individual agreements, such as the 1679 Wetterau Union.

In 1672, Louis XIV launched the Franco-Dutch War, which briefly threatened to overrun the Dutch Republic, before the conflict ended with the 1678 to 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen. The high point of French influence in this period, his opponents were dismayed when Louis XIV continued his aggressive diplomatic and military policies. The 1683–1684 War of the Reunions extended French control of Alsace and during the 1683–1699 Great Turkish War, France secretly supported the Ottomans against the Austrian Habsburgs. At the same time, payments by Louis XIV to states, including Bavaria, the Palatinate, Cologne and Brandenburg-Prussia, threatened Habsburg influence within the Holy Roman Empire. 

This sense of threat increased when Protestant Denmark–Norway also received financial backing, while in February 1685, the accession of the Catholic James II as King of England potentially provided Louis with another ally. This was followed by the October 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked tolerance for French Huguenots, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 of whom left France over the next five years. 

Concern at these policies led Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, to invite French exiles to settle in his territories, while he also agreed a treaty with the Dutch Republic in October 1685. The 1686 massacre of around 2,000 Vaudois Protestants reinforced fears Protestant Europe was threatened with another Counter-Reformation, this time led by Louis XIV.

==Formation==
With Leopold occupied by the Ottomans, in 1679 William of Orange took the lead in forming an anti-French alliance. Known as the &quot;Union of Wetterau,&quot; this coalition of Imperial German states was ostensibly set up to &quot;preserve the peace and liberties of Europe&quot;. Since the Dutch Republic was outside the Empire, it could not formally be a member of the Union, but many of its leaders were senior Dutch officers, including the head, Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck. The most significant innovation was that its members funded a central &#x27;Union&#x27; army, rather than providing individual contingents, a change that greatly enhanced its effectiveness.

The same model was used for the 1682 Laxenburg Alliance, which grouped Austria with the Upper Rhenish and Franconian Circles to defend the Rhineland, but the War of Reunions proved it could not oppose France on its own. When Philip William inherited the Palatinate in May 1685, Louis claimed half of it, based on the marriage of Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate to Philippe of Orléans, creating another crisis. 

Victory over the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 allowed Leopold to refocus on the western portions of the Empire. The League of Augsburg was formed in July 1686 by combining the Laxenburg Alliance with the Burgundian Circle, Swedish Pomerania, and Bavaria.

On 27 September 1688, French forces invaded the Rhineland and attacked Philippsburg, launching the Nine Years&#x27; War. The anti-French coalition was strengthened when the Glorious Revolution deposed James II in November 1688, and William of Orange became William III/II of England and Scotland. The Dutch Republic declared war on France in March 1689, followed by England in May.

==Membership; League of Augsburg v Grand Alliance==
The overlap between the various coalitions is often confusing. The Empire contained hundreds of members, each belonging to an Imperial Circle (see map), an administrative unit for collecting taxes and mutual support; the Swabian Circle alone had over 88 members. Individual states could form or join alliances, such as the 1685 agreement between Brandenburg-Prussia and the Dutch Republic, while Leopold signed the Grand Alliance as Archduke of Austria. However, only the Imperial Diet could commit the entire Empire; unlike the 1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, the Nine Years&#x27; War was not declared an &#x27;Imperial&#x27; one.

A number of foreign monarchs became personally involved, because they held titles and lands within the Empire. Sweden was technically neutral, but Charles XI of Sweden was also Duke of Swedish Pomerania, a member of the Lower Saxon Circle and part of the League. The same applied to the Spanish Netherlands, a member of the Burgundian Circle, but not the Kingdom of Spain, which joined the Grand Alliance in 1690.

Lastly, some writers fail to differentiate between the &quot;Grand Alliance,&quot; i.e. England, the Dutch Republic, Spain and Austria, and the wider anti-French &#x27;alliance,&#x27; which included German states like Bavaria, the Palatinate, etc. European diplomacy was extremely hierarchical; the Grand Alliance acknowledged the Dutch Republic and England as Leopold&#x27;s equals, a status he guarded with great care. This made the later admission of Savoy a major triumph for Victor Amadeus, but Leopold refused to allow Bavaria and Brandenburg-Prussia separate representation at the Ryswick peace talks in 1697.

==Provisions==

The terms of the Grand Alliance were largely based on the agreements of May 1689 between the Dutch Republic and Austria and the August 1689 Anglo-Dutch &#x27;Treaty of Friendship and Alliance.&#x27; It was finally signed on 20 December 1689, delayed by Leopold&#x27;s concerns on accepting William as King of England, and the impact on English Roman Catholics.

The main provisions were to ensure restoration of the borders agreed at Westphalia in 1648, the independence of the Duchy of Lorraine and French recognition of the Protestant Succession in England. Signatories also bound themselves not to agree a separate peace; failure to keep this commitment had greatly improved the French position during negotiations over the 1678 to 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen.

What would happen when the childless Charles II of Spain died featured in many agreements of the period, including the 1670 Treaty of Dover between England and France. A secret clause now committed England and the Dutch Republic to support Leopold&#x27;s claims to the Spanish throne, an undertaking that would lead to another war.

==Aftermath==
The main area of conflict was in the Spanish Netherlands, with the Dutch doing much of the fighting; Habsburg forces were occupied by a renewed Ottoman offensive in Southeastern Europe, while the War in Ireland absorbed resources in England and Scotland until 1692. The entry of Spain and Savoy opened new fronts in Catalonia and Northern Italy but both required support by Allied-funded German auxiliaries.

The purpose of the Grand Alliance was to resist French expansion, the legality of Louis&#x27; claims in the Palatinate being less important than their impact on the balance of power. Its creation also highlighted the obsolescence of the Imperial Circles and ultimately led to the rise of larger, more centralised states, chiefly Brandenburg-Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. As a result, it can be seen as a significant milestone in the concept of collective security, the fundamental issue at stake in the War of the Spanish Succession.

The Nine Years&#x27; War was financially crippling for participants; the average army size increased from 25,000 in 1648 to over 100,000 by 1697, a level unsustainable for pre-industrial economies. Between 1689 and 1696, 80% of English government revenues were spent on the military, with one in seven adult males serving in the army or navy; figures were similar or worse for other combatants.
 

By 1693, both sides recognised a military solution was no longer possible, and France began informal peace talks with Dutch and Savoyard representatives. Louis XIV agreed a separate peace with Savoy in the August 1696 Treaty of Turin, but wider talks made little progress. Leopold demanded the restoration of all Imperial losses in the Rhineland since 1667, and an agreement on the Spanish succession. Until these issues were addressed, he held his allies to their commitment not to make a separate peace. 

The Peace of Ryswick was agreed only after France agreed to return Luxembourg to Spain, and Louis set aside his personal commitment to James by recognising William as King of England and Scotland. Despite this, Leopold only signed with great reluctance in October 1697. His hesitation was arguably correct in that leaving the Spanish succession unresolved resulted in a new round of fighting in 1701. However, at the time the English in particular felt his demands simply prolonged a hugely expensive war for little benefit. Studies show English trade with Southern Europe alone declined by over 25% between 1689 and 1693, while the French capture of over 90 merchant ships at Lagos in 1693 caused massive losses for merchants in both London and Amsterdam. 

These losses strengthened opposition among English Tories to spending money on European wars, rather than the Royal Navy. This had a long-lasting impact on English attitudes; in 1744, James Ralph began his chapter on the Nine Years&#x27; War as follows; &#x27;The moment he (William) became sovereign, he made the Kingdom subservient to the Republic; in war, we had the honour to fight for the Dutch; in negotiation, to treat for the Dutch; while the Dutch had all possible encouragement to trade for us...&#x27;.

<text>The Ural, also known as the Yaik , is a river flowing through Russia and Kazakhstan in the continental border between Europe and Asia. It originates in the southern Ural Mountains and discharges into the Caspian Sea. At , it is the third-longest river in Europe after the Volga and the Danube, and the 18th-longest river in Asia. The Ural is conventionally considered part of the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia.

The Ural rises near Mount Kruglaya in the Ural Mountains, flows south parallel and west of the north-flowing Tobol, through Magnitogorsk, and around the southern end of the Urals, through Orsk where it turns west for about , to Orenburg, where the river Sakmara joins. From Orenburg it continues west, passing into Kazakhstan, then turning south again at Oral, and meandering through a broad flat plain until it reaches the Caspian a few kilometers below Atyrau, where it forms a fine &#x27;digitate&#x27; (tree-like) delta.

== Etymology ==
The river was called (Daïkos) by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Yulian Kulakovsky reads this as Turkic &quot;Jajyk&quot; or &quot;Яик&quot; and on this basis identifies the Huns as Turkic speakers. However, Gerard Clauson disputes that the name could be of Turkic origin as early as the 2nd century, and instead attributes it to Sarmatian origin. Also, the version of origin from the ancient Finno-Ugric and subsequent adaptation by other language groups has not been sufficiently studied (the river originates in the alleged ancestral home of the Finno-Ugric languages). In modern Finno-Ugric, the closest surviving forms are found: &quot;joki&quot; (Finnish), &quot;jogi&quot; (Karelian), &quot;jā&quot; (Mansi), &quot;ju&quot; (Komi) – river, &quot;jəŋk&quot; (Khanty) – water. Also, hypothetically Finno-Ugric titles may have tributaries of the Yaik River, for example Ilek (Erzya &quot;Ilyk&quot; – strength) and Utva (Komi &quot;Ytva&quot; – spring water). In the 10th-Century work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus referred to the Ural River as the &quot;Geich.&quot; The name Яйыҡ (Yayıq) is currently used in the Bashkir language and Жайық (Zhayıq) in Kazakhstan. In later European texts it is sometimes mentioned as &quot;Rhymnus fluvius&quot; and in the Russian chronicle of 1140 as Yaik. The river was renamed Ural in the Russian language in 1775, by Catherine II of Russia.

== History ==

In the 10th to 16th centuries, the city of Saray-Jük (or Saraichik, meaning &quot;small Sarai&quot;) on the Ural River (now in Atyrau Province of Kazakhstan) was an important trade center on the Silk Road. In the 13th century, it became a stronghold of the Golden Horde. It was destroyed in 1395 by the army of Timur but then rebuilt to become the capital of Nogai Horde in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was finally reduced to a village in 1580 by the Ural Cossacks.

After the Russian conquest of the Ural basin in the late 16th century, the shores of the Ural became home to the Yaik Cossacks. One of their main activities was fishing for the sturgeon and related fishes (including the true sturgeon, starry sturgeon, and beluga) in the Ural River and the Caspian. A great variety of fishing techniques existed; the most famous of them was &quot;bagrenye&quot; (, from &quot;bagor&quot; , meaning pike pole): spearing hibernating sturgeons in their underwater lairs in mid-winter. The &quot;bagrenye&quot; was allowed only on one day of the year. On the appointed day, a large number of Cossacks with pike poles were gathering on the shore; after a signal was given, they rushed on the ice, broke it with their poles, and speared and pulled the fish. Another fishing technique was constructing a weir, known as the &quot;uchug&quot; (учуг) across the river, to catch fish going upstream to spawn. Until 1918, an &quot;uchug&quot; was set up in the summer and autumn near Uralsk, so that the fish would not go upstream beyond the Cossacks&#x27; land. While the &quot;uchug&quot; weirs were also known in the Volga Delta, the &quot;bagrenye&quot; was thought to be a uniquely Ural technique.

The Ural Cossacks (known originally as the Yaik Cossacks) resented the attempts by the central government to impose rules and regulations on them, and on occasions rose in rebellions. The largest rebellion, the Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion of 1773–75, involved not only the Ural, but much of south-eastern Russia, and resulted in a loss of the government control there. After its suppression, Empress Catherine issued a decree of 15 January 1775 to rename most of the places involved in the revolt, in order to erase the memory of it. Thus the Yaik River and the city of Yaitsk were renamed to the Ural River and Uralsk, respectively, and the Yaik Cossacks became the Ural Cossacks.

On 6 April 2024, during the Snowmelt, a levee sheltering the city of Orsk broke. A flood in Orenburg set over 10,000 houses under water, and parts of Kazakhstan were also concerned.

== Geography ==

The river begins on the slopes of the Kruglaya Mountain of the Uraltau mountain ridge in South Ural, on the territory of the Uchalinsky District of Bashkortostan. There it has an average width of and flows as a typical mountain river. It then falls into the Yaik Swamp and after exiting it widens up to . Below Verkhneuralsk, its flow is characteristic of a flatland river; there it enters Chelyabinsk and Orenburg Oblasts. From Magnitogorsk to Orsk its banks are steep and rocky and the bottom has many rifts. After Orsk, the river abruptly turns west and flows through a long canyon in the Guberlinsk Mountains. After Uralsk, it flows from north to south, through the territory of West Kazakhstan Region and Atyrau Region of Kazakhstan. There, the river widens and has many lakes and ducts. Near the mouth, it splits into the Yaik and Zolotoy distributaries and forms vast wetlands. The Yaik distributary is shallow, with almost no trees on the shores, and is rich in fish; whereas Zolotoy is deeper and is navigable. Ural River has a spectacular tree-like (or &quot;digitate&quot;) shape of the delta (see image). This type of delta forms naturally in the slow rivers which deliver a great deal of sediments and flow into a quiet sea. In the delta, from the mouth of the Zolotoy distributary lies Shalyga Island, which is long, with heights of and maximum widths of .

The tributaries, in order going upstream, are Kushum, Derkul, Chagan, Irtek, Utva, Ilek (major, left), Bolshaya Khobda, Kindel, Sakmara, Tanalyk (major, right), Salmys, Or (major, left) and Suunduk. The Kushum and Bagyrlai are distributaries.

The entire length of the Ural River is considered the Europe-Asia boundary by most authoritative sources. Rarely, the smaller, shorter Emba River is claimed as the continental boundary, but that pushes &quot;Europe&quot; much further into &quot;Central Asian&quot; Kazakhstan. The Ural River bridge in Orenburg is even labeled with permanent monuments carved with the word &quot;Europe&quot; on one side, &quot;Asia&quot; on the other. Regardless, Kazakhstan has some European territory and is at times included in European political and sports organizations.

==Hydrography==

The river is mostly fed by melting snow (60–70%); the contribution of precipitation is relatively minor. Most of its annual discharge (65%) occurs during the spring floods, which occur in March and April near the mouth and in late April through June upstream; 30% drain during the summer and autumn and 5% in winter. During the floods, the river widens to above near Uralsk and to several tens of kilometers near the mouth. Water level is highest in later April upstream and in May downstream. Its fluctuation is in the upper stream, in the middle of the river and about in the delta. The average water discharge is near Orenburg, and at the Kushum village, which is from the mouth. The maximum discharge is and the minimum is . Average turbidity is at Orenburg and near Kushum. The river freezes at the source in early November and in the middle and lower reaches in late November. It opens in the lower reaches in late March and in early April in the upper reaches. The ice drift is relatively short.

The average depth is near the source, and it increases in the middle reaches and especially near the mouth. The density of underwater vegetation also increases from the source to the mouth, so does the richness of the fauna. The bottom in the upper stream is rocky, with pebble and sand; it changes to silt-sand and occasionally clay downstream. The basin is asymmetrical – its left side from the river is 2.1 times larger in area than the right side; however, the right side is more important for feeding the river. The density of the tributaries is 0.29 km/km2 in the right and 0.19 km/km2 in the left side of the basin. The right-side tributaries are typical mountain rivers whereas the left-side tributaries have flatland character. About from the mouth there is a dangerous spot for shipping called Kruglovskaya prorva ( meaning Kruglovsk abyss). Here the river narrows and creates a strong vortex over a deep pit. The climate is continental with frequent and strong winds. Typical annual precipitation is .

==Fauna==
The wetlands at and near the delta of the Ural River are especially important to migrating birds as an important stop-over along the Asian flyway. They host many endemic and endangered species, such as great white pelican, Dalmatian pelican, pygmy cormorant, cattle egret, little egret, greater flamingo, white-headed duck, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, houbara bustard, great black-headed gull, slender-billed gull, squacco heron, common crane, demoiselle crane, slender-billed curlew, black stork, red-breasted goose, lesser white-fronted goose, lesser kestrel, whooper swan, tundra swan, osprey, pallid harrier, short-toed eagle and many others. The pygmy cormorant was observed sporadically before 1999 and more regularly after that. Cattle egret is observed since 1990 between April and September (as most other migratory birds in this area), with the total population of several dozen couples. It feeds on frogs, mollusks and small fish. Upstream, there are more of the resident bird species, such as grouse, wild pigeon and partridge.

Ural River is also important for many fish species of the Caspian Sea which visit its delta and migrate upstream for spawning. In the lower reaches of the river there are 47 species from 13 families. The family Cyprinidae account for 40%, sturgeon and herring make up 11%, perch and herring 9% and salmon 4.4%. The main commercial species are sturgeon, roach, bream, perch, carp, asp and Wels catfish. The rare species include Caspian salmon, sterlet, white salmon and kutum.

In the delta of the river and nearby regions live about 48 animal species belonging to 7 orders; most common are rodents (21 species) and predators (12). Among them, Bobrinski&#x27;s serotine and marbled polecat are endemic. Key species are raccoon dog, muskrat (appeared recently), European hare, house mouse, brown rat, and wild boar. Wild boars had a density of 1.2–2.5 per hectare in 2000 and are hunted commercially. Others include elk, fox, wolf, dwarf fat-tailed jerboa, great gerbil, northern mole vole and saiga antelope. The Turkmenian kulan (&quot;Equus hemionus kulan&quot;) used to live at the Ural River. It might be extinct from that region.

The reptiles are represented by bog turtles, common water snakes, rat snakes and sand lizard. Bog turtles are found in all waters. Common water snakes live on the banks of canals. Rat snakes and sand lizards are few and inhabit relatively high areas of land. Two more reptiles, Caspian whipsnake and &quot;Coluber spinalis&quot;, are extremely rare. Among amphibians common are lake frog and green frog.

With an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 species, insects exceed all other animals of the region by diversity and biomass. Terrestrial and aquatic insects make up a significant proportion of the diet of birds. Many species are parasitic on birds and transmit infection. Other dominating inhabitants of the river are protozoa, rotifers, Cladocera and copepods. Mollusks are mostly represented by gastropods and bivalves.
==Industry==
Water from the upper reaches of the Ural River is used to supply the prominent Magnitogorsk (Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, built in the early 1930s) and Orsk-Khalilovsk metallurgical plants, and the low reaches are used for irrigation. Two reservoirs were created near Magnitogorsk, and there is a hydroelectric plant near the village of Iriklinskaya with the corresponding reservoir. Below Uralsk, there is another reservoir and the Kushumsky channel. The river is navigated up to Uralsk and there is a port in Atyrau. Fishery is well developed; the commercial fish species include sturgeon, perch, herring, bream, carp and catfish. The delta of Ural River accounts for about half of the fish catchment in Kazakhstan. Also widespread is agriculture, especially growth of melons and watermelons. The city of Atyrau is a major oil producing center of Kazakhstan.

<text>Yen Chia-kan (; 23 October 1905 – 24 December 1993), also known as C. K. Yen, was a Chinese-Taiwanese chemist and Kuomintang politician. He succeeded Chiang Kai-shek as the 2nd president of the Republic of China on 5 April 1975, being sworn in on 6 April 1975, and served out the remainder of Chiang&#x27;s term until 20 May 1978.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Mudu, Wu County, Jiangsu province in 1905. He came from a prestigious Suzhou family, the Yan (Yen) Family of Dongshan (). He graduated from Saint John&#x27;s University in Shanghai with a degree in chemistry in 1926.

==Political career==
In 1931, Yen began serving as a manager of the Shanghai railway administration. Yen started to work as director of the finance department of Fujian Provincial Government in 1938. During his term, he initiated a policy of land tax payment for farmers with their agricultural produce. This policy was then adopted nationwide across China and contributed significantly for the nation food supply during World War II.

When he arrived in Taiwan in October 1945, Yen was appointed transportation director for the Taiwan Provincial Government. He was later named provincial finance director. From the provincial government, Yen was subsequently elevated to chairman of the Bank of Taiwan. In this position, Yen became known as &quot;father of the New Taiwan dollar,&quot; as the currency was introduced in June 1949, during his tenure at the bank. Yen then served as Minister of Economic Affairs, minister of finance, and Governor of Taiwan Province. He became premier on 16 December 1963.

In 1966 the National Assembly elected Yen as Vice President and re-elected him in 1972. As vice president, Yen served as the most senior government official of the Republic of China to travel abroad, as Chiang Kai-shek had stated that he would not leave Taiwan until the Chinese Civil War was resolved by unification of the Republic of China. In May 1967, Yen toured the United States, during which he met US President Lyndon B. Johnson. On the afternoon of 5 January 1973, Yen visited Washington, D.C., and met with US President Richard Nixon. In December 1974, Yen traveled throughout Central America and the Caribbean, during which he attended the inauguration of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was starting his second stint as President of Nicaragua.

Yen became the second President following the death of Chiang Kai-shek. During his presidency, the Kuomintang worked on the &quot;Chang&#x27;an Project&quot; (), which was to design, manufacture, and test defensive missiles. On 9 July 1977, he visited Saudi Arabia, becoming the first Republic of China president to visit another country after the government moved to Taiwan. On 20 May 1978, Yen resigned and was succeeded by Chiang&#x27;s son, KMT Chairman and Premier Chiang Ching-kuo. 

Yen served as chairman of the Council on Chinese Cultural Renaissance during his presidency. Though he wished to resign after leaving the presidency, the organization&#x27;s bylaws were amended so that Yen could retain the post. He was also chairman of the board of the National Palace Museum until 1991.

==Death==
Yen had been bedridden since a brain hemorrhage in 1986. He suffered a second brain hemorrhage in 1992 and died at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 24 December 1993 the age of 88. He was buried at the Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in New Taipei City.

<text>Lu Zhonggui (30 September 1868 – 7 November 1895), courtesy name Xianxiang, better known by his art name Lu Haodong, was a Chinese revolutionary who lived in the late Qing dynasty. He is best known for designing the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag that became the party flag and emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party), and the canton of the flag of the Republic of China.

==Life==
Lu was born in Shanghai but his ancestral home was in Xiangshan County (now is Zhongshan), Guangdong. He was a friend of Sun Yat-sen and was involved in activities targeted at overthrowing the Qing dynasty and establishing a republic in China. In 1895, Lu co-founded the Revive China Society in Hong Kong with Sun Yat-sen. In October 1895, they planned to stage an uprising in Guangzhou, but the Qing government got wind of their plan. On 26 October, Lu was preparing to escape from Guangzhou, but decided to return to their base of operations in a church in present-day Beijinglu, Yuexiu District to burn a roster containing the names of the revolutionaries and other important documents. He could not escape in time and was arrested along with other revolutionaries by the Qing government.

Lu was taken to the yamen in Nanhai County (present-day Nanhai District, Foshan, Guangdong) for interrogation by the county magistrate Li Zhengyong (), who was acting under instructions from Tan Zhonglin (), the Viceroy of Liangguang. When he refused to kneel down before Li during questioning, the magistrate said, &quot;You are a talented young man. Why did you want to get yourself in trouble that would cost you your life? I feel sorry for you that you don&#x27;t value your life.&quot; Lu replied sternly, &quot;China is a vast country and it has the highest population in the world, but it is poor and weak because the Qing government is authoritarian and incompetent in foreign policy. My comrades and I originally planned an uprising with the aim of overthrowing the Qing government and replacing it with a new republican government. I intended to kill one or two persons like you who serve the Qing government. Now that our plan has failed, I can&#x27;t kill you but you can kill me. What&#x27;s there to feel sorry about?&quot;

The American embassy in Guangzhou attempted to save Lu&#x27;s life by claiming that he was a translator working at the telegraph office and was not a revolutionary. However, they could not do anything when Li Zhengyong showed them a confession written by Lu himself. Lu, Zhu Guiquan (), Qiu Si () and other captured revolutionaries were executed on 7 November by the order of Tan Zhonglin. Sun Yat-sen called Lu &quot;the first person in Chinese history who sacrificed his life for a democratic revolution&quot;.

Lu is credited for designing the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag that became the party flag and emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party), and the canton of the flag of the Republic of China.

<text>Red Harvest (1929) is a novel by American writer Dashiell Hammett. The story is narrated by the Continental Op, a frequent character in Hammett&#x27;s fiction, much of which is drawn from his own experiences as an operative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency (fictionalized as the Continental Detective Agency). The plot follows the Op&#x27;s investigation of several murders amid a labor dispute in a corrupt Montana mining town. Some of the novel was inspired by the Anaconda Road massacre, a 1920 labor dispute in the mining town of Butte, Montana.

&quot;Time&quot; included &quot;Red Harvest&quot; in its 100 Best English-Language Novels from 1923 to 2005, noting that, in the Continental Op, Hammett &quot;created the prototype for every sleuth who would ever be called &#x27;hard-boiled.&#x27;&quot; The Nobel Prize-winning author André Gide called the book &quot;a remarkable achievement, the last word in atrocity, cynicism, and horror.&quot;

== Plot ==
The Continental Op is called to Personville (known as &quot;Poisonville&quot; to the locals) by the newspaper publisher Donald Willsson, who is murdered before the Op has a chance to meet with him. The Op begins to investigate Willsson&#x27;s murder and meets with Willsson&#x27;s father, Elihu Willsson, a local industrialist who has found his control of the city threatened by several competing gangs. Elihu had originally invited those gangs into Personville to help him impose and then enforce the end of a labor dispute.

The Op extracts a promise and a signed letter from Elihu that pays the Continental Detective Agency, the Op&#x27;s employer, $10,000 in exchange for cleaning up the city and ridding it of the gangs. After the Op quickly identifies Donald&#x27;s murderer, Elihu tries to renege on the deal, but the Op will not allow him to do so. While the Op had been investigating, the corrupt police chief Noonan had tried twice to have him gunned down, causing the Op to take a personal interest in the job.

In the meantime, the Op is spending time with Dinah Brand, a possible love interest of the late Donald Willsson and a moll for Max &quot;Whisper&quot; Thaler, a local gangster. The Op extracts information from Brand and Noonan, and increases tension in the city by leaking it to the warring parties. When the Op reveals that a bank robbery was staged by the cops and one of the gangs to discredit another gang, a gang war erupts.

The Op, disturbed by the slaughter he orchestrated, spends an evening of blackout inebriation with Brand, who finds it all amusing. He wakes the next morning to find her stabbed to death with the ice pick he had handled the previous evening. No signs of forced entry are visible, and he can&#x27;t even be sure he did not do the stabbing himself during his delirium. The Op becomes a suspect sought by the police for Brand&#x27;s murder, and one of his fellow operatives, Dick Foley, leaves Personville because he is uncertain of the Op&#x27;s innocence.

The Op, now wanted by the police, entices Reno Starkey, a gang lieutenant, to take on the last strong rival gang led by Pete the Finn. The gangs are whittled down by pipe bombs, arson, gun fights, and corrupt cops gunning down the survivors.

The Op tracks down Starkey, the only gang leader still alive. Starkey is bleeding from four gunshot wounds, having just killed his rival Whisper Thaler. Starkey reveals that he was the one who stabbed Brand, but because she had collided with the semiconscious Op he had looked like the culprit. Starkey later succumbs to his wounds in the hospital.

The corrupt police chief Noonan and the gang leaders are all dead. The Op blackmails Elihu Willsson into calling the governor, who sends in the National Guard, declares martial law, and suspends the entire police force. Elihu Willsson gets back his town, as promised, although not in the way that he had anticipated. The Op returns to San Francisco, where the Old Man (the chief of the Continental Detective Agency&#x27;s office) criticizes him.

== Adaptations ==
Film critics David Desser and Manny Farber, among others, have noted similarities between &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and the 1961 film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, directed by Akira Kurosawa. Other scholars, such as Donald Richie, believe the similarities are coincidental. Kurosawa said that a major source for &quot;Yojimbo&quot; was the &quot;film noir&quot; classic &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942), an adaptation of Hammett&#x27;s 1931 novel of the same name. In &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, corrupt officials and businessmen stand behind and profit from the rule of gangsters.

In the early 1970s, Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered filming an adaptation of &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and wrote a first draft infused with political themes typical of his work. A short while after, he wrote a second draft that was more faithful to Hammett&#x27;s story. For the role of the Op he considered Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson (who had played a hard-boiled detective in Roman Polanski&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Chinatown&quot;), and Clint Eastwood (who had played the Op-inspired &quot;Man with No Name&quot; in Sergio Leone&#x27;s Dollars Trilogy). At some point, Bertolucci discussed this project with Warren Beatty in Rome. In 1982, Bertolucci moved to Los Angeles to begin production, but the project was shelved.

Donald E. Westlake wrote an unproduced screenplay adapting &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, which changed the story considerably to refocus the ending on the murder of Donald Willsson; Westlake felt that having the solution of the mystery come so early in the novel made the Op&#x27;s continued involvement hard to justify.

As of 2024, Scott Frank and Megan Abbott are writing a script for &quot;Red Harvest&quot; for A24. 

== In popular culture ==

===Film===
While Akira Kurosawa stated that a major source for the plot for &quot;Yojimbo&quot; was the 1942 classic &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, an adaptation of Hammett&#x27;s 1931 novel &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, it has been noted by some critics that the overall plot of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; is closer to that of Hammett&#x27;s &quot;Red Harvest&quot;.

The Coen brothers&#x27; film &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984) takes its title from a line in &quot;Red Harvest&quot; in which the Op tells Brand the escalating violence has affected his mental state: &quot;This damned burg&#x27;s getting me. If I don&#x27;t get away soon, I&#x27;ll be going blood-simple like the natives.&quot; The Coens&#x27; film &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990) employs stylistic and narrative elements of Hammett&#x27;s &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; &quot;The Glass Key,&quot; and several of Hammett&#x27;s shorter works. 

The dialogue and plot of director Rian Johnson&#x27;s debut feature, &quot;Brick&quot;, was inspired by the novels of Dashiell Hammett, particularly &quot;Red Harves&quot;t.

===Literature===
Science-fiction writer David Drake has said that he took the plot of his novel &quot;The Sharp End&quot; (1993) from &quot;Red Harvest&quot;.

===Television===
In &quot;The Aurora Teagarden Mysteries&quot; Season 1 episode 10, &quot;A Game of Cat and Mouse&quot;, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; is quoted as is &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;.

<text>Lin Sen (; 16 March 1868 – 1 August 1943), was a Chinese politician who served as Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China from 1931 until his death.

==Early life==
Born to a middle-class family in (尚幹鄉), Minhou County, Fuzhou, Lin was educated by American missionaries. He later worked in the Telegram Bureau of Taipei, Taiwan in 1884. After the First Sino-Japanese War, he engaged in guerrilla activities against the Japanese occupiers. He returned to China and worked in the Shanghai customs office in 1902. He later lived in Hawaii and San Francisco.

There he was recruited by the Tongmenghui in 1905, and was an overseas organizer for the Kuomintang. During the Xinhai Revolution, he was in charge of the Jiangxi revolt. He became speaker of the senate in the National Assembly. After the failed Second Revolution against President Yuan Shikai, Lin fled with Sun Yat-sen to Japan and joined his Chinese Revolutionary Party. He was sent to the United States to raise funds from the party&#x27;s local branches. In 1917, he followed Sun to Guangzhou where he continued to lead its &quot;extraordinary session&quot; during the Constitutional Protection Movement. When the assembly defected to the Beiyang government, he remained with Sun and later served as governor of Fujian.

Lin was a member of the right-wing Western Hills Group based in Shanghai. The group was formed in Beijing shortly after Sun&#x27;s death in 1925. They called for a party congress to expel the Communists and to declare social revolution as incompatible with the Kuomintang&#x27;s national revolution. The party pre-empted this faction and the ensuing congress expelled Western Hills&#x27; leaders and suspended the membership of the followers. They supported Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s purge of the communists in 1927. Lin rose to become the leader of the Western Hills faction and undertook a world tour after the demise of the Beiyang government.

==As head of state==
In 1931, Chairman Chiang&#x27;s arrest of Hu Hanmin caused an uproar within the party and military. Lin and other high-ranking officials called for the impeachment of Chiang. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria prevented the civil war from erupting, however it did cause Chiang to resign on 15 December. Lin was appointed in his place as acting chairman and confirmed as chairman of government on 1 January 1932. He was chosen as a sign of personal respect and held few powers since the Kuomintang wanted to avoid a repeat of Chiang&#x27;s rule. He never used the Presidential Palace, where Chiang continued to reside, and preferred his modest rented house near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Chiang&#x27;s full influence was restored after the 1932 Battle of Shanghai as party grandees realized his necessity.

Shortly after acceding to the chairmanship, Lin Sen embarked on an extended trip that took him to the Philippines, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. He visited the Chinese diaspora and the Kuomintang party organisations in those countries. This was the first overseas visit by a serving head of state of China.

In 1934, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;puppet President Lin&quot;, and when there was a talk by military chief Chiang Kai-shek at a &quot;secret conference of government leaders&quot; of granting the President of China actual powers, it insinuated that Chiang was entertaining the thought of taking the Presidency himself, since Chiang held the actual power while Lin&#x27;s position was described as &quot;figurehead class&quot;.

Though he had little influence on public policy, Lin was highly respected by the public as an august elder statesman who was above politics. His lack of political ambition, corruption, and nepotism was an exceedingly rare trait. He lent dignity and stability to an office while other state institutions were in chaos.

A widower, Lin used his position to promote monogamy and combat concubinage which became a punishable felony in 1935. He also called for a peaceful resolution when Chiang was kidnapped during the Xi&#x27;an Incident. National unity was something he stressed as relations with Japan deteriorated further.

When the Second Sino-Japanese War entered full swing in 1937, he moved to the wartime capital of Chongqing. He legalized civilian use of guerrilla warfare, but this was merely a formality as it was already a widespread practice. He spurned all offers to defect and collaborate with the Japanese puppet government.

==Death==
On 10 March 1943, his car was involved in an accident. Two days later, he had a stroke while meeting the Canadian delegation. As he was in hospice, he urged the recovery of Taiwan be included in the post-war settlement; it became part of the Cairo Declaration months later. He died on 1 August, aged 76, following which a month of mourning was declared. He was the longest serving head of state in the Republic of China while it still held mainland China. The central executive committee elected Chiang as chairman of government a few hours after Lin&#x27;s death. All of the powers that were denied to the chairmanship were restored for Chiang.

Lin visited Qingzhi Mountain in Lianjiang, Fuzhou, Fujian and was fascinated by it, which encouraged him to style himself &quot;Old Man Qingzhi&quot; () in his old age. His monument, built beside Qingzhi Mountain in 1926 before his death, was damaged in the Cultural Revolution, and was restored in 1979.

==Family==

Lin had adopted his nephew Lin Jing (known in English as K.M. James Lin), as his son. While studying as a postgraduate student in Ohio State University, James Lin married Viola Brown, a five-and-ten-cent store clerk, although he was reported already to have two wives in China. Lin Sen objected to the marriage and the couple eventually divorced. James Lin returned to China and died in action during the Japanese invasion.

==Legacy==

There are roads named after Lin Sen in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, and other towns and cities in Taiwan due to his role in fighting the Japanese invasion of Taiwan and as ROC president.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Lin was denounced for his anti-communism and roads and places named after Lin Sen were renamed, but he was later rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution.

<text>William Duncan Silkworth (July 22, 1873 – March 22, 1951) was an American physician and specialist in the treatment of alcoholism. He was director of the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City in the 1930s, during which time William Griffith Wilson, a future co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.), was admitted on four occasions for alcoholism. Dr. Silkworth had a profound influence on Wilson and encouraged him to realize that alcoholism was more than just an issue of moral weakness. He introduced Wilson to the idea that alcoholism had a pathological, disease-like basis.

== Early life ==

=== Birthplace ===
William Duncan Silkworth was born in Brooklyn on July 22, 1873, to parents William Silkworth and Isabelle Silkworth, &quot;née&quot; Duncan. William was the eldest of three siblings; he had a younger brother named Russel and a younger sister named Mabel.

=== Education ===
Silkworth attended Long Branch High School (then called Chattle High School), which was a three-year program when he began studying there. At the end of Silkworth&#x27;s third year, the school authorities announced that they were converting the school to a four-year program. Aggrieved, Silkworth refused to return for a fourth year as he had already been accepted to Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey).

Between 1892 and 1896, Silkworth obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Princeton University. It would take Silkworth several years to obtain a high school diploma; during which time, he was able to study at Princeton because the college authorities proved willing to overlook the fact that he technically had not graduated high school provided that he maintained excellent academic standings. Silkworth began his university studies as a pre-med student, but quickly developed an interest and began to specialize in neuropsychiatry.

Upon graduating from Princeton, Silkworth studied at Bellevue Hospital Medical College beginning in 1896 and graduating with a Medical Degree in 1899 after completing the four-year program in three years. While interning at Bellevue Hospital, Dr. Silkworth was exposed to many alcoholics and doctors with expertise on alcoholism since Bellevue was one of the only hospitals with a department specializing in the treatment of alcoholism in the United States at the time.

=== Marriage ===
Silkworth married Marie Antoinette Bennett in Manhattan on July 22, 1898. On February 27, 1909, his wife gave birth to a son who lived for only six days before dying on March 4, 1909. The couple would have no other children, though they remained married all their lives.

== Treatment of alcoholism ==
During Dr. Silkworth&#x27;s career, he is estimated to have treated more than 40,000 alcoholics and was regarded as one of the world&#x27;s leading experts in the field. In 1937, Dr. Silkworth published a pair of articles in the &quot;Medical Record&quot; titled &quot;Alcoholism as a Manifestation of Allergy&quot; and &quot;Reclamation of the Alcoholic&quot; wherein he proposed a physical disease model of alcoholism and a psychotherapeutic treatment method that induced patients to admit powerlessness over their addiction and to adopt a new moral psychology. In the latter paper, Dr. Silkworth describes five case studies of patients that he had treated for alcoholism at the Towns Hospital; in Case V, Dr. Silkworth describes the successful recovery of Bill Wilson who was already in the early stages of founding the organization that would come to be known as Alcoholics Anonymous.

== &#x27;The Doctor&#x27;s Opinion&#x27; ==
During 1938 and 1939, Dr. Silkworth wrote letters in support of Alcoholics Anonymous which were included in a chapter titled &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Opinion&quot; in the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; and helped to provide the nascent organization with credibility. Crucially, he described the powerlessness of alcoholism as an obsession of the mind that compels one to drink and an allergy of the body that condemns one to go mad or die. Dr. Silkworth further observed that alcoholics could recover if they could obtain an essential psychic change brought about with the aid of a &quot;Higher Power.&quot;

== End of life ==
Dr. Silkworth died at Towns Hospital on March 22, 1951, after suffering a heart attack. He is buried at the Glenwood Cemetery in West Long Branch, New Jersey.

<text>Robert Holbrook Smith (August 8, 1879 – November 16, 1950), also known as Dr. Bob, was an American physician and surgeon who cofounded Alcoholics Anonymous with Bill Wilson (more commonly known as Bill W.).

==Family and early life==

Smith was born in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, where he was raised, to Susan A. (Holbrook) and Walter Perrin Smith. His parents took him to religious services four times a week, and in response he determined he would never attend religious services when he grew up. He graduated from St Johnsbury Academy in 1898, having met his future wife Anne Robinson Ripley at a dance there.

==Education, marriage, work, and alcoholism==

Smith began drinking at college attending Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Early on he noticed that he could recover from drinking bouts quicker and easier than his classmates and that he never had headaches, which caused him to believe he was an alcoholic from the time he began drinking. Smith was a member of Kappa Kappa Kappa fraternity at Dartmouth. After graduation in 1902, he worked for three years selling hardware in Boston, Chicago, and Montreal and continued drinking heavily. He then returned to school to study medicine at the University of Michigan. By this time drinking had begun to affect him to the point where he began missing classes. His drinking caused him to leave school, but he returned and passed his examinations for his sophomore year. He transferred to Rush Medical College, but his alcoholism worsened to the point that his father was summoned to try to halt his downward trajectory. But his drinking increased and after a dismal showing during final examinations, the university required that he remain for two extra quarters and remain sober during that time as a condition of graduating.

After graduation, Smith became a hospital intern, and for two years he was able to stay busy enough to refrain from heavy drinking. He married Anne Robinson Ripley on January 25, 1915, and opened up his own office in Akron, Ohio, specializing in colorectal surgery and returned to heavy drinking. Recognizing his problem, he checked himself into more than a dozen hospitals and sanitariums in an effort to stop his drinking. He was encouraged by the passage of Prohibition in 1919, but soon discovered that the exemption for medicinal alcohol, and bootleggers, could supply more than enough to continue his excessive drinking. For the next 17 years his life revolved around how to subvert his wife&#x27;s efforts to stop his drinking and obtain the alcohol he craved while trying to hold together a medical practice in order to support his family and his drinking.

==Meeting Bill Wilson==

In January 1933, Bob Smith attended a lecture by Frank Buchman, the founder of the Oxford Group. For the next two years Smith attended local meetings of the group in an effort to solve his alcoholism, but recovery eluded him until he met Bill Wilson on May 12, 1935. Wilson was an alcoholic who had learned how to stay sober, thus far only for some limited amounts of time, through the Oxford Group in New York, and was close to discovering long-term sobriety by helping other alcoholics. Wilson was in Akron on business that had proven unsuccessful and he was in fear of relapsing. Recognizing the danger, he made inquiries about any local alcoholics he could talk to and was referred to Smith by Henrietta Seiberling, one of the leaders of the Akron Oxford Group. After talking to Wilson, Smith stopped drinking and invited Wilson to stay at his home. He relapsed almost a month later while attending a professional convention in Atlantic City. Returning to Akron on June 9, he was given a few drinks by Wilson to avoid delirium tremens. He drank one beer the next morning to settle his nerves so he could perform an operation, which proved to be the last alcoholic drink he would ever have. The date, June 10, 1935, is celebrated as the anniversary of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous.

==Final years==
Smith was called the &quot;Prince of Twelfth Steppers&quot; by Wilson because he helped more than 5000 alcoholics before his death. He was able to stay sober from June 10, 1935, until his death in 1950 from colon cancer. He is buried at the Mount Peace Cemetery in Akron, Ohio.

<text>Tibetans () are an East Asian ethnic group native to Tibet. Their current population is estimated to be around 7.7 million. In addition to the majority living in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, significant numbers of Tibetans live in the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan, as well as in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.

The Tibetic languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman language group. The traditional or mythological explanation of the Tibetan people&#x27;s origin is that they are the descendants of the human Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa and rock ogress Ma Drag Sinmo. It is thought that most of the Tibeto-Burman speakers in southwest China, including Tibetans, are direct descendants from the ancient Qiang people.

Most Tibetans practice Tibetan Buddhism, although a significant minority observe the Indigenous Bon religion. There are also smaller communities of Tibetan Muslims and Christians. Tibetan Buddhism influences Tibetan art, drama and architecture, while the harsh geography of Tibet has produced an adaptive culture of Tibetan medicine and cuisine.

==Demographics==
As of the 2014 census, there are about 6 million Tibetans living in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the 10 Tibetan autonomous prefectures in the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan. The SIL Ethnologue in 2009 documents an additional 189,000 Tibetic speakers living in India, 5,280 in Nepal and 4,800 in Bhutan. The Central Tibetan Administration&#x27;s (CTA) Green Book (of the Tibetan Government in Exile) counts 145,150 Tibetans outside Tibet: a little over 100,000 in India; over 16,000 in Nepal; over 1,800 in Bhutan, and over 25,000 in other parts of the world. There are Tibetan communities in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, France, Mexico, Norway, Mongolia, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan, the Balti people are a Muslim ethnicity of Tibetan descent numbering around 300,000.

There is some dispute over the current and historical number of Tibetans. The Central Tibetan Administration claims that the 5.4 million number is a decrease from 6.3 million in 1959 while the Chinese government claims that it is an increase from 2.7 million in 1954. However, the question depends on the definition and extent of &quot;Tibet&quot;; the region claimed by the CTA is more expansive and China more diminutive. Also, the Tibetan administration did not take a formal census of its territory in the 1950s; the numbers provided by the administration at the time were &quot;based on informed guesswork&quot;.

===In China===
According to the Sixth National Population Census of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (2010), there are 6,282,187 Tibetans nationwide:

There are 2,716,388 people in the Tibet Autonomous Region, 1,496,524 people in Sichuan Province, 1,375,059 people in Qinghai Province, 488,359 people in Gansu Province (mostly in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Bairi Tibetan Autonomous County) and 142,257 people in Yunnan Province (mostly in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture). Tibetans account for 0.47% of the total population of the country. Tibetans account for 90.48% of the total population in Tibet Region, 24.44% of the total population of Qinghai and 1.86% of the total population in Sichuan. Of all Tibetans in China, 315,622 people live in cities, 923,177 in towns, and 5,043,388 people (80.3%) live in rural areas.

According to the Seventh Census of 2020, there are 7,060,700 Tibetans living within China. Of the resident population of the Tibet Autonomous Region, 3,204,700 were Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, of whom 3,137,900 were Tibetans, an increase of 421,500, or 15.52%, over 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 1.45%; 66,800 were other ethnic minorities, an increase of 26,300, or 64.95%, over 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 5.13%; and 6,680 were other ethnic minorities, an increase of 26,300, or 64.95%, over 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 5.13%. The average annual growth rate was 5.13%.

There are one region, ten prefectures, and two counties officially established by the government: the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), Qinghai Province (Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Haiximenggu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture), Sichuan Province (Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Ganz Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Muji Tibetan Autonomous County), Gansu Province (Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture), and Yunnan Province (Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture).

===In India===
In India Tibetic people are found in the regions of Ladakh (Ladakhi and Balti), Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh, Spiti valley, Uttarakhand (Bhotiya), Sikkim (Bhutia), and Arunachal Pradesh (Khamba, Lhoba and Monpa people). There are also nearly 100,000 Tibetans living in exile in India since 1959, the majority of them living in Tibetan enclaves such as Dharamshala and Bylakuppe.

In 2011, the Indian government reported 150,000 Tibetan diaspora residing in India. In 2019, the number of Tibetan diaspora in India declined to 85,000.

===In Nepal===
Tibetans are known as Bhotiyas in Nepal, where they are majority in regions such as Upper Mustang, Dolpo, Walung region and Limi and Muchu valleys. Nepal is also home to other Tibetic people such as the Gurung, Sherpa, Jirel, Hyolmo and Tamang. There are also more than 10,000 Tibetan refugees in Nepal.

==Language==


The Tibetic languages () are a cluster of mutually unintelligible Sino-Tibetan languages spoken by approximately 8 million people, primarily Tibetan, living across a wide area of East and South Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau and Baltistan, Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan. Classical Tibetan is a major regional literary language, particularly for its use in Buddhist literature.

The Central Tibetan language (the dialects of Ü-Tsang, including Lhasa), Khams Tibetan, and Amdo Tibetan are generally considered to be dialects of a single language, especially since they all share the same literary language, while Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, Jirel, and Ladakhi are generally considered to be separate languages.


==Ethnic origins==
The ethnic roots of Tibetans can be traced back to a deep Eastern Asian lineage representing the indigenous population of the Tibetan plateau since c. 40,000 to 30,000 years ago, and arriving Neolithic farmers from the Yellow River within the last 10,000 years, and which can be associated with having introduced the Sino-Tibetan languages.

=== Genetics ===

Modern Tibetan populations are genetically most similar to other East Asian populations, Bhutanese, as well as other Sino-Tibetan-speaking populations. They show relatively more genetic affinity for modern Central Asian than modern Siberian populations. They also share some genetic affinity for South Asian groups.

Genetic studies shows that many of the Sherpa people have allele frequencies which are often found in other Tibeto-Burman regions, the strongest affinity was for Tibetan population sample studies done in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Genetically, the Sherpa cluster closest with the sampled Tibetan and Han populations. Additionally, the Sherpa and Tibetans had exhibited affinity for several Nepalese populations, with the strongest for the Rai people, followed by the Magars and the Tamang.

==== Haplogroups ====
Tibetan males predominantly belong to the paternal lineage D-M174 followed by lower amounts of O-M175. Tibetan females belong mainly to the Northeast Asian maternal haplogroups M9a1a, M9a1b, D4g2, D4i and G2ac, showing continuity with ancient middle and upper Yellow River populations.

Although &quot;East Asian Highlanders&quot; (associated with haplogroup D1) are closely related to East Asian lowland farmers (associated with haplogroup O), they form a divergent sister branch to them.

==== Autosomal DNA ====

Full genome studies revealed that Tibetans and other high-alltitude East Asians formed from two divergent Ancient East Eurasian lineages in Eastern Asia, specifically a lineage representing the Paleolithic population of the Tibetan Plateau, and a lineage associated with Ancient Northern East Asians. The Paleolithic Tibetan lineage was found to be distinct from other deep lineages such as Ust&#x27;-Ishim, Hoabinhian/Onge or Tianyuan, but forming a clade with them to the exclusion of other Eurasians. The Northern East Asian lineage can be represented by Neolithic Yellow River farmers, which are associated with the spread of Sino-Tibetan languages. Modern Tibetans derive up to 20% from Paleolithic Tibetans, with the remaining 80% being primarily derived from Yellow River farmers. The formation of the present-day Tibetan gene pool dates back at least 5,100 years BP. 
Northeastern Tibetans display additional geneflow from a Yellow River farmers-like population c. 4,700 years ago, resulting in the formation of a &quot;Tibetan cline&quot;.
Modern Tibetans display genetic continuity to ancient samples from Nepal, with their genetic diversity having been reduced compared to &#x27;Early Ancient Tibetans&#x27; suggesting low to none geneflow from outside groups since c. 3,500 years ago. Subsequent internal geneflow resulted in &quot;a northeastern plateau ancestry associated with the northeast cluster, a southern plateau ancestry associated with the south-southwest cluster, and a southeastern plateau ancestry associated with the southeast-central cluster&quot;.

There was limited contact with Central Asian populations, inline with historical events, evident in mutual geneflow. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire may have left genetic traces in surrounding populations.

==== Adaption to high-altitude environments ====
Genetic studies identified more than 30 genetic factors that make Tibetans&#x27; bodies well-suited for high-altitudes, including the EPAS1 gene, also referred to as the &quot;super-athlete gene&quot;, which regulates the body&#x27;s production of hemoglobin, allowing for greater efficiency in the use of oxygen. The genetic basis of Tibetan adaptations have been attributed to a mutation in the EPAS1 gene, and has become prevalent in the past 5,000 years. Ancient Tibetans carried this allele at a frequency of 25–58%, while modern Tibetans carry it at a frequency of &gt;75%. The widespread presence of this gene may represent one of &quot;the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans&quot;.

Recent research into the ability of Tibetans&#x27; metabolism to function normally in the oxygen-deficient atmosphere above shows that, although Tibetans living at high altitudes have no more oxygen in their blood than other people, they have ten times more nitric oxide and double the forearm blood flow of low-altitude dwellers. Tibetans inherited this adaptation due to selected genes associated with Denisovan admixture among Asian populations, highlighting how different environments trigger different selective pressures. Nitric oxide causes dilation of blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more freely to the extremities and aids the release of oxygen to tissues.

===Mythological origins===
According to Tibetan mythology, the origins of Tibetans are said to be rooted in the marriage of the monkey Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa and rock ogress Ma Drag Sinmo.

== Religion ==

Most Tibetans generally observe Tibetan Buddhism or a collection of native traditions known as Bön (also absorbed into mainstream Tibetan Buddhism). There is a minority Tibetan Muslim population. There is also a small Tibetan Christian population in the eastern Tibet and northwestern Yunnan of China.

According to legend, the 28th king of Tibet, Thothori Nyantsen, dreamed of a sacred treasure falling from heaven, which contained a Buddhist sutra, mantras, and religious objects. However, because the Tibetan script had not been invented, the text could not be translated in writing and no one initially knew what was written in it. Buddhism did not take root in Tibet until the reign of Songtsen Gampo, who married two Buddhist princesses, Bhrikuti of Nepal and Wencheng of China. It then gained popularity when Padmasambhāva visited Tibet at the invitation of the 38th Tibetan king, Trisong Deutson.

Today, one can see Tibetans placing Mani stones prominently in public places. Tibetan lamas, both Buddhist and Bön, play a major role in the lives of Tibetans, conducting religious ceremonies and taking care of the monasteries. Pilgrims plant prayer flags over sacred grounds as a symbol of good luck.

The prayer wheel is a means of simulating the chant of a mantra by physically revolving the object several times in a clockwise direction. It is widely seen among Tibetans. In order not to desecrate religious artifacts such as Stupas, mani stones, and Gompas, Tibetan Buddhists walk around them in a clockwise direction, although the reverse direction is true for Bön. Tibetan Buddhists chant the prayer &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot;, while the practitioners of Bön chant &quot;Om matri muye sale du&quot;.

==Culture==


Tibet is rich in culture. Tibetan festivals such as Losar, Shoton, Linka, and the Bathing Festival are deeply rooted in indigenous religion and also contain foreign influences. Each person takes part in the Bathing Festival three times: at birth, at marriage, and at death.

===Art===
Tibetan art is deeply religious in nature, from the exquisitely detailed statues found in Gonpas to wooden carvings and the intricate designs of the Thangka paintings. Tibetan art can be found in almost every object and every aspect of daily life.

Thangka paintings, a syncretism of Indian scroll-painting with Nepalese and Kashmiri painting, appeared in Tibet around the 8th century. Rectangular and painted on cotton or linen, they usually depict traditional motifs including religious, astrological, and theological subjects, and sometimes a mandala. To ensure that the image will not fade, organic and mineral pigments are added, and the painting is framed in colorful silk brocades.

===Drama===
Tibetan folk opera, known as lhamo, is a combination of dances, chants and songs. The repertoire is drawn from Buddhist stories and Tibetan history.

Tibetan opera was founded in the fourteenth century by Thang Tong Gyalpo, a lama and a bridge-builder. Gyalpo and seven girls he recruited organized the first performance to raise funds for building bridges to facilitate transportation in Tibet. The tradition continued uninterrupted for nearly seven hundred years, and performances are held on various festive occasions such as the Lingka and Shoton festival. The performance is usually a drama, held on a barren stage that combines dances, chants, and songs. Colorful masks are sometimes worn to identify a character, with red symbolizing a king and yellow indicating deities and lamas. The performance starts with a stage purification and blessings. A narrator then sings a summary of the story, and the performance begins. Another ritual blessing is conducted at the end of the play. There are also many historical myths/epics written by high lamas about the reincarnation of a &quot;chosen one&quot; who will do great things.

===Architecture===
The most unusual feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south. They are commonly made of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heating or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against frequent earthquakes in the mountainous area. Tibetan homes and buildings are white-washed on the outside, and beautifully decorated inside.

Standing at in height and in width, the Potala Palace is considered the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama, it contains over a thousand rooms within thirteen stories and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures.
===Medicine===
Traditional Tibetan medicine utilizes up to two thousand types of plants, forty animal species, and fifty minerals. One of the key figures in its development was the renowned 8th century physician Yuthog Yontan Gonpo, who produced the Four Medical Tantras integrating material from the medical traditions of Persia, India and China. The tantras contained a total of 156 chapters in the form of Thangkas, which tell about the archaic Tibetan medicine and the essences of medicines in other places.

===Cuisine===

The Cuisine of Tibet reflects the rich heritage of the country and people&#x27;s adaptation to high altitude and religious culinary restrictions. The most important crop is barley. Dough made from barley flour, called tsampa, is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momo. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat or mutton, often dried or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item.

===Clothing===
Men and Women wear long thick dresses (&quot;chuba&quot;) in more traditional and rural regions. The men wear a shorter version with pants underneath. The style of the clothing varies between regions. Nomads often wear thick sheepskin versions. In more urban places like Lhasa, men and women dress in modern clothing, and many choose to wear chuba during festivals and holidays like Losar.

===Literature===
Tibet has national literature that has both religious, semi-spiritual and secular elements. While the religious texts are well-known, Tibet is also home to the semi-spiritual Gesar Epic, which is the longest epic in the world and is popular throughout Mongolia and Central Asia. There are secular texts such as &quot;The Dispute Between Tea and Chang&quot; (Tibetan beer) and &quot;Khache Phalu&#x27;s Advice&quot;.

==Marriage customs==
Monogamy is common throughout Tibet. Marriages are sometimes arranged by the parents if the son or daughter has not picked their own partner by a certain age. However, polyandry is practiced in parts of Tibet. This is usually done to avoid division of property and provide financial security.

<text>The Cambridge Ring was an experimental local area network architecture developed at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge starting in 1974 and continuing into the 1980s. It was a ring network with a theoretical limit of 255 nodes (though such a large number would have badly affected performance), around which cycled a fixed number of packets. Free packets would be &quot;loaded&quot; with data by a sending machine, marked as received by the destination machine, and &quot;unloaded&quot; on return to the sender; thus in principle, there could be as many simultaneous senders as packets.

The network ran over twin twisted-pair cabling (plus a fibre-optic section) at a raw data rate of 10 megabits/sec.
There are strong similarities between the Cambridge Ring and an earlier ring network developed at Bell Labs based on a design by John R. Pierce. That network used T1 lines at bit rate of 1.544 MHz and accommodating 522 bit messages (data plus address).

People associated with the project include Andy Hopper, David Wheeler, Maurice Wilkes, and Roger Needham.
A 1980 study by Peter Cowley reported several commercial implementors of elements of the network, ranging from Ferranti (producing gate arrays), Inmos (a semiconductor manufacturer), Linotype Paul, Logica VTS, MDB Systems, and Toltec Data (a design company who manufactured interface boards).

In 2002, the Computer Laboratory launched a graduate society called the Cambridge Computer Lab Ring named after the Cambridge Ring.

<doc id="249461" wikidata="Q869835" url="?curid=249461" title="Ishe Komborera Africa">
<text>&quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; (Shona for: God Bless Africa), also called &quot;Ishe Komborera Zimbabwe&quot; (Shona for: God Bless Zimbabwe), was the Zimbabwean national anthem from 1980 to 1994. It was the country&#x27;s first national anthem after gaining independence in 1980. It is a translation of 19th-century South African schoolteacher Enoch Sontonga&#x27;s popular African hymn &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; into Zimbabwe&#x27;s native Shona and Ndebele languages.

The song was first translated into Shona in the early 20th century and was initially popular with all sections of society in Southern Rhodesia. Following Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, it was polarized as a symbol of the Zimbabwe liberation movement. It was adopted in 1980 following Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence as a show of solidarity with other African movements in countries under apartheid. It was replaced as the national anthem of Zimbabwe in 1994 by &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe&quot; (Shona for: Raise Our Zimbabwean Flag) as part of a move to adopt a uniquely Zimbabwean composition for use as the national anthem, but it still remains very popular in the country.

== History ==

In the early 20th century, &quot;Nkosi Sikielel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; was becoming popular with black Africans. In Southern Rhodesia it was originally sung in the original Xhosa language before being translated into Shona which created &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot;. The new Shona language hymn was first performed at the start of a meeting of the Southern Rhodesia Native Association and then again four days later at the closure of the first meeting of the Bantu National Congress, which the Southern Rhodesia Native Association later became affiliated to. By the 1948 African General Strike, it had become the main political song amongst black Africans. Despite that connotation, the song was accepted by black and white Rhodesians. In 1951, at a British South African Police athletics competition, &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; was sung by combined black and white policemen to commemorate the first multi-racial competition in Southern Rhodesia.

Following Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the British Empire, the new Rhodesian authorities started to crack down on African liberation movements. One of their considerations was to ban performance of &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; in African schools and public performance of it often made people liable for arrest by the British South African Police. The District Commissioner for Gutu abolished the Gutu African Council after its leader opened a meeting by singing &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; in the District Commissioner&#x27;s presence. The Commissioner also had the leader arrested but he was released without charge. Following the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980, after Zimbabwe Rhodesia returned to British control as Southern Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Union party won to become the first government of an independent Zimbabwe. After this, &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; was selected to replace the official &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; of Southern Rhodesia and &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot; of Rhodesia as the national anthem of an independent Zimbabwe as it was a symbol of black African struggles and solidarity against apartheid systems in South Africa and South West Africa. At the Zimbabwean independence ceremony, the Union Jack was lowered to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and the new flag of Zimbabwe was raised to &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; in Salisbury.

== Replacement ==
In 1994, it was deemed that Zimbabwe should change its national anthem to avoid similarities with other countries who used the tune of &quot;Ishe Kombererra Africa&quot;. Tanzania used &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot;, Zambia used &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot; (to the same tune), also Ciskei and Transkei who used &quot;Nkosi Sikielel&#x27; &#x27;Afrika&quot;. It was also because Mugabe wanted to develop a new distinctly Zimbabwean identity with a unique national anthem. A contest was held to determine a new national anthem and &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe&quot; by Solomon Mutswairo was chosen. The new anthem was promoted prior to &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; being replaced as the official national anthem. However, there was scepticism from Christians about the need for replacing &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; with the belief that it was part of a plan by ZANU-PF to remove references to God from Zimbabwe&#x27;s official proceedings.

The change of anthem from &quot;Ishe Komberera Africa&quot; was later confirmed by the Parliament of Zimbabwe in 1995 by the passage of the National Anthem of Zimbabwe Act. The act also made it a criminal offence to insult the new national anthem and also granted the President of Zimbabwe the right to make regulations controlling its use and how it was to be sung.

== Legacy ==
Despite being replaced as the Zimbabwe national anthem, &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; is still popular in Zimbabwe. It is still used as a hymn within Zimbabwean churches. In 1997, following the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) voting in favour of a motion that African elephants were not endangered in some countries and thus their ivory could be exported from those countries, representatives of the African nations celebrated by singing &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; while conservationists cried.

&quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; has also erroneously been played as the Zimbabwean national anthem instead of &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe&quot; since losing its status as Zimbabwe&#x27;s national anthem. In 2004, at the Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia, before the Zimbabwe national football team&#x27;s match against Egypt, &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; was played instead of &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe&quot;. In response, the Zimbabwean Information Minister, Jonathan Moyo accused it of being &quot;a cheap attempt by the organisers to demoralise our boys&quot;. Later in the year, the same situation occurred at the African Athletics Championships in the Republic of the Congo when the Zimbabwean men&#x27;s relay team won gold. The Zimbabwean team insisted the correct national anthem be played; however, as the band were unable to perform it, Lloyd Zvasiya sang it himself through a microphone.
