<text>The First Macedonian War (214–205 BC) was fought by Rome, allied (after 211 BC) with the Aetolian League and Attalus I of Pergamon, against Philip V of Macedon, contemporaneously with the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) against Carthage. There were no decisive engagements, and the war ended in a stalemate.

During the war, Macedon attempted to gain control over parts of Illyria, but without success. It is commonly thought that these skirmishes in the east prevented Macedon from aiding the Carthaginian general Hannibal in the war with Rome. The Peace of Phoenice (205 BC) formally ended the war.

==Demetrius urges war against Rome==

Rome&#x27;s preoccupation with its war against Carthage provided an opportunity for Philip V of Macedon to attempt to extend his power westward. According to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, an important factor in Philip&#x27;s decision to take advantage of this opportunity was the influence of Demetrius of Pharos.

After the First Illyrian War (229–228 BC) the Romans had made Demetrius ruler of most of coastal Illyria. In the decade after the war he turned against the Romans attacking their allies in Illyria and raiding their trade vessels. In 219 BC, during the Second Illyrian War he was defeated by the Romans and fled to the court of king Philip.

Involved in a war with the Aetolians, Philip learned of the victory of Hannibal over the Romans, at Lake Trasimene in June 217 BC. Philip at first showed the letter only to Demetrius. Perhaps seeing a chance to recover his kingdom, Demetrius immediately advised the young king to make peace with the Aetolians and turn his attentions toward Illyria and Italy. Polybius quotes Demetrius as saying:

According to Polybius, Philip was easily persuaded.

==Philip makes peace with Aetolia==
Philip at once began negotiations with the Aetolians. At a conference on the coast near Naupactus, Philip met the Aetolian leaders and a peace treaty was concluded. Polybius quotes the Aetolian Agelaus of Naupactus as having given the following speech in favor of peace:


==Philip builds a fleet==
Philip spent the winter of 217–216 BC building a fleet of 100 warships and training men to row them and, according to Polybius, it was a practice that &quot;hardly any Macedonian king had ever done before&quot;. Macedon probably lacked the resources to build and maintain the kind of fleet necessary to match the Romans. Polybius says that Philip had no &quot;hope of fighting the Romans at sea&quot;, perhaps referring to a lack of experience and training.

At any rate, Philip chose to build &quot;lembi&quot;. These were the small fast galleys used by the Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars and were able to carry 50 soldiers in addition to the rowers. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based as it was at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.

Philip had in the meantime expanded his territories west along the Apsus and Genusus river valleys, right up to the borders of Illyria. Philip&#x27;s plan was, it seems, to first take the Illyrian coasts, conquer the area between the coasts and Macedon, and use the new land link to provide a rapid route for reinforcements across the narrow straits to Italy.

At the beginning of summer, Philip and his fleet left Macedon, sailed through the Euripus Strait, between the island of Euboea and Boeotia on the Greek mainland, and then rounded Cape Malea, before dropping anchor off the Islands of Cephalenia and Leucas, to await word of the location of the Roman fleet. Informed that it was still at Lilybaeum, he sailed north to Apollonia in Illyria.

However, as the Macedonian fleet neared the island of Sazan, Philip heard a report that some Roman quinqueremes had been seen headed for Apollonia. Convinced that the entire Roman fleet was sailing to apprehend him, Philip ordered an immediate return to Cephalenia. Polybius speaks of &quot;panic&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; to describe the fleet&#x27;s hasty retreat and says that, in fact, the Romans had sent only a squadron of ten ships and that because of &quot;inconsiderate alarm&quot;, Philip had missed his best chance to achieve his aims in Illyria, returning to Macedon, &quot;without loss indeed, but with considerable dishonour&quot;.

==Philip allies with Carthage==
After hearing of Rome&#x27;s disastrous defeat at the hands of Hannibal at Cannae in 216 BC, Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal&#x27;s camp in Italy to negotiate an alliance. There they concluded in the summer of 215 BC a treaty, the text of which is given by Polybius. In it they pledge, in general terms, mutual support and defense and to be enemies to each other&#x27;s enemies (excepting current allies). Specifically, they promised support against Rome and that Hannibal shall have the right to make peace with Rome, but that any peace would include Philip and that Rome would be forced to relinquish control of Corcyra, Apollonia, Epidamnus, Pharos, Dimale, Parthini, and Atintania and &quot;to restore to Demetrius of Pharos all those of his friends now in the dominion of Rome.&quot;

The treaty as set down by Polybius makes no mention of an invasion of Italy by Philip, the debacle at Sazan perhaps having soured Philip on such a venture, something which in any case Hannibal may not have desired.

On their way back to Macedon, Philip&#x27;s emissaries, along with emissaries from Hannibal, were captured by Publius Valerius Flaccus, commander of the Roman fleet patrolling the southern Apulian coast. A letter from Hannibal to Philip and the terms of their agreement, were discovered.

Philip&#x27;s alliance with Carthage caused immediate dismay in Rome, hard-pressed as they already were. An additional twenty-five warships were at once outfitted and sent to join Flaccus&#x27; fleet of twenty-five warships already at Tarentum, with orders to guard the Italian Adriatic coast, to try to determine Philip&#x27;s intent and, if necessary, cross over to Macedonia, keeping Philip confined there.

==War breaks out in Illyria==
In the late summer of 214 BC, Philip again attempted an Illyrian invasion by sea, with a fleet of 120 lembi. He captured Oricum which was lightly defended, and sailing up the Aous (modern Vjosë) river he besieged Apollonia.

Meanwhile, the Romans had moved the fleet from Tarentum to Brundisium to continue the watch on the movements of Philip and a legion had been sent in support, all under the command of the Roman propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus. Upon receiving word from Oricum of events in Illyria, Laevinus crossed over with his fleet and army. Landing at Oricum, Laevinus was able to retake the town with little fighting.

In the account given by Livy, Laevinus, hearing that Apollonia was under siege, sent 2000 men under the command of Quintus Naevius Crista, to the mouth of the river. Avoiding Philip&#x27;s army, Crista was able to enter the city by night unobserved. The following night, catching Philip&#x27;s forces by surprise, he attacked and routed their camp. Escaping to his ships in the river, Philip made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having burned his fleet and leaving behind many thousands of his men that had died or been taken prisoner, along with all of his armies&#x27; possessions. Meanwhile, Laevinus and his fleet wintered at Oricum.

Twice thwarted in his attempts at invasion of Illyria by sea, and now constrained by Laevinus&#x27; fleet in the Adriatic, Philip spent the next two years (213–212 BC) making advances in Illyria by land. Keeping clear of the coast, he took Dassaretis, Atintani and Parthini, and the town of Dimale.

He was finally able to gain access to the Adriatic by capturing Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However, the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would now be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.

==Rome seeks allies in Greece==
Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out allies in Greece.

Laevinus had begun exploring the possibility of an alliance with the Aetolian League as early as 212 BC. The war weary Aetolians had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However, five years later the war faction was on the ascend and the Aetolians were once again considering taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedonia.

In 211 BC, an Aetolian assembly was convened for discussions with Rome. Laevinus pointed out the recent capture of Syracuse and Capua in the war against Carthage as evidence of Rome&#x27;s rising fortunes and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed whereby the Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea and Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.

==Campaign in Greece==
Later that summer, Laevinus seized the main town of Zacynthus, except for its citadel, the Acarnanian town of Oeniadae and the island of Nasos, which he handed over to the Aetolians. He then withdrew his fleet to Corcyra for the winter.

Upon hearing of the Roman alliance with Aetolia, Philip&#x27;s first action was to secure his northern borders. He conducted raids in Illyria at Oricum and Apollonia and seized the frontier town of Sintia in Dardania or perhaps Paionia. He then marched rapidly south through Pelagonia, Lyncestis and Bottiaea and on to Tempe which he garrisoned with 4,000 men. He turned north again into Thrace, attacking the Maedi and their chief city Iamphorynna before returning to Macedon.

No sooner had Philip arrived there when he received an urgent plea for help from his ally the Acarnanians. Scopas the Aetolian &quot;strategos&quot; (general) had mobilized the Aetolian army and was preparing to invade Acarnania. Desperate and overmatched, but determined to resist, the Acarnanians sent their women, children and old men to seek refuge in Epirus and the rest marched to the frontier, having sworn an oath to fight to the death, &quot;invoking a terrible curse&quot; upon any who were forsworn. Hearing of the Acarnanians&#x27; grim determination, the Aetolians hesitated then, learning of Philip&#x27;s approach, finally abandoned their invasion, after which Philip retired to Pella for the winter.

In the spring of 210 BC, Laevinus again sailed from Corcyra with his fleet and, together with the Aetolians, captured Phocian Anticyra. Rome enslaved the inhabitants and Aetolia took possession of the town.

Although there was some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the coalition arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land by the rest of the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.

However, the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans remained passive throughout 210 BC and Philip continued to make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian &quot;strategos&quot; Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west, Philip probably also took Phalara the port city of Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.

In the spring of 209 BC, Philip received requests for help from his ally the Achaean League in the Peloponnesus who were being attacked by Sparta and the Aetolians. He also heard that Attalus had been elected one of the two supreme commanders of the Aetolian League, as well as rumors that he intended to crossover the Aegean from Asia Minor. Philip marched south into Greece. At Lamia he was met by an Aetolian force, supported by Roman and Pergamene auxiliaries, under the command of Attalus&#x27; colleague as &quot;strategos&quot;, the Aetolian Pyrrhias. Philip won two battles at Lamia, inflicting heavy casualties on Pyrrhias&#x27; troops. The Aetolians and their allies were forced to retreat inside the city walls, where they remained, unwilling to give battle.

==Attempt at peace fails==
From Lamia, Philip went to Phalara where he met representatives from the neutral states of Egypt, Rhodes, Athens and Chios who were trying to end the war. As trading states, the war was likely hurting trade; Livy says that they were concerned &quot;not so much for the Aetolians, who were more warlike than the rest of the Greeks, as for the liberty of Greece, which would be seriously endangered if Philip and his kingdom took an active part in Greek politics.&quot; With them was Amynandor of Athamania, representing the Aetolians. A truce of thirty days and a peace conference at Achaea were arranged.

Philip marched to Chalcis in Euboea, which he garrisoned to block Attalus&#x27; landing there, then continued on to Aegium for the conference. The conference was interrupted by a report that Attalus had arrived at Aegina and the Roman fleet was at Naupactus. The Aetolian representatives, emboldened by these events, at once demanded that Philip return Pylos to the Messenians, Atintania to Rome and the Ardiaei to Scerdilaidas and Pleuratus. &quot;Indignant&quot;, Philip quit the negotiations telling the assembly that they &quot;might bear him witness that whilst he was seeking a basis for peace, the other side were determined to find a pretext for war&quot;.

==Hostilities resume==
From Naupactus, Sulpicius sailed east to Corinth and Sicyon, conducting raids there. Philip, with his cavalry, caught the Romans ashore and was able to drive them back to their ships, with the Romans returning to Naupactus.

Philip then joined Cycliadas, the Achaean general, near Dyme for a joint attack on the city of Elis, the main Aetolian base of operations against Achaea. However, Sulpicius had sailed into Cyllene and reinforced Elis with a force of 4,000 Roman troops. Leading a charge, Philip was thrown from his horse. Fighting on foot, Philip became the object of a fierce battle, finally escaping on another horse. The next day, Philip captured the stronghold of Phyricus, taking 4,000 prisoners and 20,000 animals. Hearing news of Illyrian incursions in the north, Philip abandoned Aetolia and returned to Demetrias in Thessaly.

Meanwhile, Sulpicius sailed round into the Aegean and joined Attalus on Aegina for the winter. In 208 BC, the combined fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships failed to take Lemnos, but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of Peparethos (Skopelos), both Macedonian possessions.

Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in Heraclea Trachinia of the Council of the Aetolians, which included representatives from Egypt and Rhodes, who were continuing to try to arrange a peace. Learning of the conference and the presence of Attalus, Philip marched rapidly south in an attempt to break up the conference and catch the enemy leaders, but arrived too late.

Surrounded by foes, Philip was forced to adopt a defensive policy. He distributed his commanders and forces and set up a system of beacon fires at various high places to communicate instantly any enemy movements.

After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus on the northern coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.

==The war ends==
Although Philip considered Attalus&#x27; escape a bitter defeat, it proved to be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the urging of Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina, so free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.

The neutral trading powers were still trying to arrange a peace and, at Elateia, Philip met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who had been at the previous meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip&#x27;s way, but the Aetolians, although now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip&#x27;s terms. However, after another season of fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, and without Rome&#x27;s consent, the Aetolians sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip.

The following spring the Romans sent the censor Publius Sempronius Tuditanus with 35 ships and 11,000 men to Dyrrachium in Illyria, where he incited the Parthini to revolt and laid siege to Dimale. However, when Philip arrived, Sempronius broke off the siege and withdrew inside the walls of Apollonia. Sempronius tried unsuccessfully to entice the Aetolians to break their peace with Philip. With no more allies in Greece, but having achieved their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal, the Romans were ready to make peace. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC, the so-called &quot;Peace of Phoenice,&quot; which formally ended the First Macedonian War.

<text>The Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC) was fought between Macedon, led by Philip V of Macedon, and Rome, allied with Pergamon and Rhodes. Philip was defeated and was forced to abandon all possessions in southern Greece, Thrace and Asia Minor. During their intervention, although the Romans declared the &quot;freedom of the Greeks&quot; against the rule from the Macedonian kingdom, the war marked a significant stage in increasing Roman intervention in the affairs of the eastern Mediterranean, which would eventually lead to Rome&#x27;s conquest of the entire region.

==Background==

In 204 BC, King Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt died, leaving the throne to his six-year-old son Ptolemy V. Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus the Great of the Seleucid Empire decided to exploit the weakness of the young king by taking Ptolemaic territory for themselves and they signed a secret pact defining spheres of interest, opening the Fifth Syrian War. Philip first turned his attention to the independent Greek city states in Thrace and near the Dardanelles. His success at taking cities such as Kios worried the state of Rhodes and King Attalus I of Pergamon who also had interests in the area.

In 201 BC, Philip launched a campaign into Asia Minor, besieging the Ptolemaic city of Samos and capturing Miletus. Again, this disconcerted Rhodes and Attalus and Philip responded by ravaging Attalid territory and destroying the temples outside the walls of Pergamon. Philip then invaded Caria but the Rhodians and Pergamenians successfully blockaded his fleet in Bargylia, forcing him to spend the winter with his army in a country which offered very few provisions.

At this point, although they appeared to have the upper hand, Rhodes and Pergamon still feared Philip so much that they sent an appeal to the rising power of Rome, which had just emerged victorious from the Second Punic War against Carthage. The Romans had previously fought the First Macedonian War against Philip V over Illyria, which had been resolved by the Peace of Phoenice in 205 BC. Very little in Philip&#x27;s recent actions in Thrace and Asia Minor could be said to concern the Roman Republic directly. The Senate passed a supportive decree and Marcus Valerius Laevinus was sent to investigate.

Earlier in 201 BC, Athens&#x27; relations with Philip had suddenly deteriorated. A pair of Acarnanians had entered the Temple of Demeter during the Eleusinian Mysteries and the Athenians had put them to death. In response, the Acarnanian League launched a raid on Attica, aided by Macedonian troops which they had received from Philip V. Shortly after this, King Attalus I arrived in Athens with Rhodian ambassadors and convinced the Athenians, who had maintained strict neutrality since the end of the Chremonidean War, to declare war on Macedon. Attalus sailed off, bringing most of the Cycladic islands over to his side and sent embassies to the Aetolian League in the hope of bringing them into the war as well. In response to the Athenian declaration of war, Philip dispatched a force of 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry under the command of Philokles to invade Attica and place the city of Athens under siege.

==Course of the war==
===Rome enters the war (200 BC)===
On 15 March 200 BC, new consuls, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Gaius Aurelius Cotta took office in Rome. In light of reports from Laevinus and further embassies from Pergamon, Rhodes, and Athens, the task of dealing with the troubles in Macedonia was allotted to Sulpicius. He called an assembly of the Comitia centuriata, the body with the legal power to make declarations of war. The Comitia nearly unanimously rejected his proposed war, an unprecedented act which was attributed to war weariness. At a second session, Sulpicius convinced the Comitia to vote for war. Sulpicius recruited troops and departed to Brundisium in the autumn, where he added veterans of the Second Punic War who had just returned from Africa to his forces. Then he crossed the Adriatic, landing his troops in Apollonia and stationing the navy at Corcyra.

====Siege of Abydos====
While these events had been taking place, Philip V himself had undertaken another campaign in the Dardanelles, taking a number of Ptolemaic cities in rapid succession before besieging the important city of Abydos. Polybius reports that during the siege of Abydos, Philip had grown impatient and sent a message to the besieged that the walls would be stormed and that if anybody wished to commit suicide or surrender they had three days to do so. The citizens promptly killed all the women and children of the city, threw their valuables into the sea and fought to the last man. During the siege of Abydos, in the autumn of 200 BC, Philip was met by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, a Roman ambassador on his way back from Egypt, who urged him not to attack any Greek state or to seize any territory belonging to Ptolemy and to go to arbitration with Rhodes and Pergamon. Philip protested that he was not in violation of any of the terms of the Peace of Phoenice, but in vain. As he returned to Macedonia after the fall of Abydos, he learnt of the landing of Sulpicius&#x27; force in Epirus.

====Cento&#x27;s attack on Chalcis and Philip&#x27;s invasion of Attica====
The Athenians, who were now besieged by Macedonian forces, sent an appeal to the Roman force in Corcyra. Gaius Claudius Centho was sent with 20 ships and 1,000 men to aid them. Philokles and his troops withdrew from Attica to their base in Corinth. In response to a request from Chalcidean exiles, Claudius led a surprise raid on the city of Chalcis in Euboea, one of the key Antigonid strongholds known as the &#x27;fetters of Greece&#x27; and inflicting serious damage and heavy casualties.

Philip rushed to Chalcis with a force of 5,000 men and 300 cavalry. Finding that Claudius had already withdrawn, he sped on towards Athens, where he defeated the Athenian and Attalid troops in a battle outside the Dipylon Gate and encamped at Cynosarges. After setting fire to the sanctuaries and tombs outside the city walls, Philip departed to Corinth. From there, Philip went down to Argos where the Achaean League was holding an assembly, which he attempted to bring onto his side in exchange for supporting them in their ongoing conflict with Nabis of Sparta, but he was rebuffed. Joining up with a force of 2,000 men brought by his general Philokles, Philip made a series of three unsuccessful assaults on Eleusis, Piraeus, and Athens and ravaged the territory of Athens. Then he ravaged the sanctuaries throughout Attica and withdrew to Boeotia. The damage to the rural and deme sanctuaries of Attica was severe and marks the permanent end of their use.

Philip spent the rest of the winter preparing for the Roman assault. He sent his young son Perseus with a force to prevent the Romans and Dardanians from advancing over the Šar Mountains into northern Macedonia. Philip had the settlements on the Sporades islands of Peparethos and Skiathos destroyed to prevent enemies using them as naval bases. The Macedonian army was gathered at Demetrias.

===Sulpicius and Villius&#x27; campaigns (200-199 BC)===
====Sulpicius&#x27; invasion of Upper Macedonia====

During this time Sulpicius had established a firm base by the Seman river in Illyria. A force under Lucius Apustius was sent to raid the western border of Macedonia, capturing or razing a number of cities, including Antipatrea and Codrion. Following this expedition, Sulpicius received the allegiance of the Illyrians under Pleuratus III, the Dardanians under Bato, and the Athamanes under Amynander. The diplomatic efforts of Philip, Sulpicius, and the Athenians centred on the Aetolian League, which seemed inclined to support the Romans but remained neutral at this stage.

In the spring of 199 BC, Sulpicius led his troops east through the territory of the Dassaretii, an Illyrian tribe that occupied the area bordering western Macedonia. Philip gathered 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, recalling the troops he had stationed in the north with Perseus, and marched west. He encamped on a hill near Athacus which overlooked Sulpicius&#x27; camp. After a series of indecisive skirmishes (in one of which Philip was nearly captured), news came that the Dardanians had invaded northern Macedonia, and the Macedonians withdrew secretly in the night. When he realised what had happened, Sulpicius set out in pursuit through Pelagonia, found Philip blocking the pass to Eordaea and forced it. Sulpicius ravaged Eordaea, then Elimeia to the south, and then followed the Haliacmon river valley up to Orestis, where he conquered Celetrum and Pelion and then returned to his base. Philip split his force, sending a contingent of his army north to deal with the Dardanian invasion, which it did, while he himself headed south.

====Roman naval campaign and Aetolian campaign====
At the same time as this land campaign set out, the Roman fleet had left Corcyra under command of Lucius Apustius, rounded Cape Malea, and rendezvoused with King Attalus near Hermione. The combined fleet then launched an assault on the Macedonian military base on the island of Andros and seized it for Pergamon. The fleet was joined by further ships from Issa and Rhodes and headed north to the Chalkidike peninsula where an assault on Cassandreia was a complete failure. They withdrew to northern Euboea, where they besieged and captured Oreus, another key Macedonian naval base. Since it was now autumn and the sailing season was drawing to a close, the contingents of the fleet dispersed back to their home ports.

As these campaigns progressed, Damocritus, the strategos of the Aetolian League, had decided that it was time to join the war on the Roman side. Together with King Amynander, he led an invasion of Magnesia and Perrhaebia, then continued to ravage Thessaly. There, Philip suddenly appeared and completely defeated their force. He spent some time besieging the Aetolian city of Thaumaci, but gave up and withdrew as winter approached. He spent the winter training his army and engaging in diplomacy, particularly with the Achaean League.

====Villius&#x27; campaign====
In Rome, the new consuls took office on 15 March 199 BC, Publius Villius Tappulus was allotted Macedonia as his province. He crossed the Adriatic to Corcyra, where he replaced Sulpicius in command of the army. On his arrival, Villius faced a mutiny by 2,000 troops, veterans of the Second Punic War who wished to be demobilised. He resolved this, by forwarding their concerns to the Senate, but was left with little time to prosecute a campaign. Philip marched west and encamped on both sides of the Aoös river where it passed through a narrow ravine. Villius marched to meet him but was still considering what to do when he learnt that his successor, Titus Quinctius Flamininus had been elected and was on his way to Corcyra to assume command.

In Asia Minor, Pergamon was invaded by the Seleucid king Antiochus III. As a result, Attalus was not able to assist in the naval war in the Aegean until a Roman embassy forced Antiochus to withdraw.

===Flamininus&#x27; first campaign (198 BC)===
====Roman invasion of Thessaly====
When the new consuls took office on 15 March 198, the Senate ordered the recruitment of 8,000 new infantry and 800 cavalry for the war. Command in Macedonia was allotted to Flamininus. He was not yet thirty and was a self-proclaimed Philhellene.

Flamininus was delayed by religious matters for some time, but then he recruited the new forces, crossed the Adriatic, and dismissed Villius. The army encamped in the Aous Valley, across the river from Philip&#x27;s for forty days. At a peace conference, Flamininus announced the Romans&#x27; new peace terms. Up to this point, the Romans had merely ordered Philip to stop attacking the Greek cities. Now Flamininus demanded that he should make reparations to all the Greek cities he had harmed and withdraw all his garrisons from cities outside Macedonia, including Thessaly, which had been part of the Macedonian kingdom continuously since 353 BC. Philip stormed out of the meeting in anger and Flamininus decided to attack.

In the subsequent Battle of the Aous, Flamininus was victorious despite the advantage the terrain gave to the Macedonian army, when he was shown a pass through the mountains which allowed him to send a force to attack the Macedonians from the rear. The Macedonian force collapsed and fled, suffering 2,000 casualties. Philip was able to gather up the survivors and retreat to Thessaly. There he destroyed the city of Tricca to prevent it falling into Roman hands and withdrew to Tempe.

After the Roman victory, the Aetolians led a rapid attack through Ainis and into Dolopia, while King Amynander attacked and captured Gomphi, in the south-western corner of Thessaly. Meanwhile, Flamininus entered Epirus, which now joined the Roman side. Together with Amynander, he entered Thessaly. The army did not encounter much resistance at first, but he became caught up in a prolonged siege at Atrax. Eventually he was forced to abandon this siege and march south into Phocis in order to secure his supply lines and lodgings for winter by capturing Anticyra. He then besieged and captured Elateia.

====Roman naval campaign====
While this campaign was taking place, the consul&#x27;s brother, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus had taken control of the Roman fleet and sailed to Athens. He rendezvoused with the Attalid and Rhodian fleets near Euboea. Eretria was taken after fierce fighting and Carystus surrendered, meaning that the entire island of Euboea was now under Roman control. The fleet travelled back around Attica to Cenchreae and placed Corinth under siege.

From there, Lucius, Attalus, the Rhodians, and the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Achaian League in order to bring them into the war on the Roman side. The league held an assembly at Sicyon to decide how to respond, which was extremely contentious. On the one hand, the Achaians were still at war with Sparta and they were allied to Macedonia, but on the other hand their new chief magistrate Aristaenus was pro-Roman and the Romans promised to give the city of Corinth to the League. The representatives of Argos, Megalopolis, and Dyme, which all had particularly strong ties with Philip, left the meeting. The rest of the assembly voted to join the anti-Macedonian alliance.

The Achaian army joined the other forces besieging Corinth, but after fierce fighting the siege had to be abandoned when 1,500 Macedonian reinforcements commanded by Philokles arrived from Boiotia. From Corinth, Philokles was invited to take control of Argos by pro-Macedonians in the city, which he did without a fight.

====Winter negotiations====
Over the winter of 198/197 BC, Philip declared his willingness to make peace. The parties met at Nicaea in Locris in November 198 - Philip sailed from Demetrias, but he refused to disembark and meet Flamininus and his allies on the beach, so he addressed them from the prow of his ship. To prolong the proceedings, Flamininus insisted that all his allies should be present at the negotiations. He then reiterated his demands that Philip should withdraw all his garrisons from Greece, Illyria, and Asia Minor. Philip was not prepared to go this far and he was persuaded to send an embassy to the Roman Senate. When this embassy reached Rome, the Senate demanded that Philip surrender the &quot;fetters of Greece,&quot; Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth, but Philip&#x27;s envoys claimed they had no permission to agree to this, so the war continued.

According to Polybius and Plutarch, these negotiations were manipulated by Flamininus - Philip&#x27;s overtures had come just as elections were being held in Rome. Flamininus was eager to take the credit for ending the war, but he did not yet know whether his command would be prolonged and had intended to make a quick peace deal with Philip, if it was not. He therefore dragged out the negotiations until he learnt that his command had been prorogued and then had his friends in Rome scupper the meeting in the Senate.

Once this had become clear, Philip attempted to free up his forces by handing the city of Argos over to Nabis of Sparta, but Nabis then engineered a revolution in the city and organised a conference with Flamininus, Attalus and the Achaeans at Mycenae, at which he agreed to stop attacking the Achaeans and to supply troops to the Romans.

===Flamininus&#x27; second campaign (197 BC)===

Over the rest of the winter, Philip mobilised all the manpower of his kingdom including the aged veterans and the underage boys, which amounted to 18,000 men. To these he added 4,000 peltasts from Thrace and Illyria, and 2,500 mercenaries. All these forces were gathered at Dion. Reinforcements were sent to Flamininus from Italy, numbering 6,000 infantry, 300 cavalry, and 3,000 marines.

At the start of spring, Flamininus and Attalus went to Thebes to bring the Boeotian League into the coalition. Because Flamininus had managed to sneak 2,000 troops into the city, the assembly of the League had no choice but to join the Roman coalition. At the assembly, King Attalus suddenly suffered a stroke while giving a speech and was left paralysed on one side. He was eventually evacuated back to Pergamon, where he died later that year.

In June 197 BC, Flamininus marched north from Elateia through Thermopylae. En route, he was joined by forces from Aetolia, Gortyn in Crete, Apollonia, and Athamania. Philip marched south into Thessaly and the two armies encamped opposite each other near Pherae. Both armies relocated to the hills around Scotussa. Contingents of the opposing armies came into contact with one another in the Cynoscephalae hills, leading to a full battle. In what proved to be the decisive engagement of the war, the legions of Flamininus defeated Philip&#x27;s Macedonian phalanx. Philip himself fled on horseback, collected the survivors, and withdrew to Macedonia. Philip was forced to sue for peace on Roman terms.

====Achaia, Acarnania, and Caria====
At the same time as this campaign was taking place in Thessaly, three other campaigns occurred in Achaea, Acarnania, and Caria - in all of which the Macedonians were defeated.

In the Peloponnese, Androsthenes set out from Corinth with a Macedonian army of 6,000 men into the lands controlled by the Achaean League and pillaged the territories of Pellene, Phlius, Cleonae, and Sicyon. The Achaean general, Nicostratus, who was able to muster 5,000 men, closed off the pass back to Corinth, and defeated the Macedonian forces in detail.

In Acarnania, there had been attempts to switch to the Roman side before the Battle of Cynoscephalae, but the League&#x27;s assembly had eventually decided against this because of their hostility to the Aetolians. Lucius Flamininus therefore sailed to the Acarnanian capital of Leucas, and launched an all-out assault, which proved very difficult. Thanks to traitors inside the city, it was eventually captured. Shortly after this, news of the Battle of Cynoscephalae arrived and the rest of the Acarnanians surrendered.

In Asia Minor, the Rhodians led a force of 4,500 mercenaries (mostly Achaeans) into Caria to recapture the Rhodian Peraia. A battle took place with the Macedonian forces in the area at Alabanda, in which the Rhodians were victorious. The Rhodians then recaptured their Peraia, but failed to take Stratonicea.

==Aftermath==
===The Peace of Flamininus===
An armistice was declared, and peace negotiations were held in the Vale of Tempe. Philip agreed to evacuate the whole of Greece and relinquish his conquests in Thrace and Asia Minor. Philip had to rush off almost immediately after the agreement of terms to deal with an invasion of Upper Macedonia by the Dardanians.

The treaty was sent to Rome for ratification. Despite the efforts of the consul-elect Marcus Claudius Marcellus to prolong the war, the Roman Tribal Assembly voted unanimously to make peace. The Senate sent ten commissioners to advise on the final peace terms, including Publius Sulpicius Galba and Publius Villius Tappulus.

On the advice of these men, the final peace was made with Philip in spring 196 BC. Philip had to remove all his garrisons in Greek cities in Europe and Asia, which were to be free and autonomous. Philip had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents - half paid immediately and the rest in ten annual instalments of 50 talents. He had to surrender his whole navy except for his flagship, while his army was limited to a maximum of 5,000 men, could not include elephants, and could not be led beyond his borders without permission of the Roman Senate.

===Boeotian campaign===
Over the winter of 197/196 BC, while the peace negotiations were still ongoing, conflict had broken out in Boeotia, leading to the assassination of the pro-Macedonian Boeotarch Brachylles by the pro-Roman leaders Zeuxippus and Peisistratus. There was a strong popular backlash, resulting in the murder of about 500 Roman soldiers who had been billeted in Boeotia. Roman forces invaded Boeotia, but the Athenians and Achaeans managed to negotiate a settlement.

===Aetolian response to the peace===
At the initial peace negotiations, a rift opened up between Flamininus and the Aetolians, since the latter wanted harsher peace terms imposed on Philip than Flamininus was willing to countenance and desired the return of a number of cities that they had previously controlled in Thessaly but Flamininus refused to back them. The Aetolians began to claim that the Romans planned to retain garrisons in the &quot;fetters of Greece&quot; and replace the Macedonians as overlords of Greece. The growing Aetolian hostility to the Romans was expressed openly to one of the ten Roman commissioners at a meeting of Delphian Amphictyony in 196 BC. This conflict would ultimately lead to the Aetolian War in 191 BC.

===The Freedom of the Greeks===
At the Isthmian Games of May 196 BC, Flamininus proclaimed the &#x27;Freedom of the Greeks&#x27; met with general rejoicing of those who were attending the Games. The proclamation listed the free communities as follows: . Nevertheless, the Romans kept garrisons in key strategic cities which had belonged to Macedon – Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias – and the legions were not completely evacuated until 194 BC.

The extent of this grant of freedom was not entirely clear. Although Flamininus&#x27; proclamation had included a list of the communities formerly under Philip&#x27;s control to which it applied, the Romans quickly assumed (or were thrust into) the role of protector of Greek freedom more generally. The rhetoric of Greek freedom was almost immediately employed by the Romans and their allies to justify diplomatic and military action elsewhere, with the War against Nabis of Sparta, which was undertaken in 195 BC, ostensibly for the sake of the freedom of Argos.

===Seleucid conquest of Asia Minor===
The initial background to the whole war had been the alliance of Antiochus III and Philip V against Ptolemy V and while the war had been raging in Greece, Antiochus III had completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces in Syria at the Battle of Panium. Since Philip had surrendered his claim to the communities in Asia Minor that had formerly been under Ptolemaic control, Antiochus III now advanced into Asia Minor to take them over for himself. The conflicts arising from this would lead to the outbreak of the Roman–Seleucid War in 192 BC.

<text>The Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC) was a war fought between the Roman Republic and King Perseus of Macedon. In 179 BC, King Philip V of Macedon died and was succeeded by his ambitious son Perseus. He was anti-Roman and stirred anti-Roman feelings around Macedonia. In 172 BC, a Roman commission visited Perseus and required of him concessions which meant the extinction of his independence. Upon his refusal to comply with the demands they returned home and Rome declared war.

Most of the war was fought in Macedon as well as neighbouring Thessaly, where the Roman troops were stationed. After an inconclusive battle at Callinicus in 171 BC, and several years of campaigning, Rome decisively defeated the Macedonian forces at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, ending the war.

Rome&#x27;s victory ended the Antigonid dynasty and brought an effective end to the independence of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon, although formal annexation was some years away. The kingdom was divided into four client republics, each subservient to Rome. Roman prestige and authority in Greece greatly increased.

==Background==

In 179 BC, King Philip V of Macedon died and his ambitious son, Perseus, ascended the throne. In pursuit of an alliance, Perseus married Laodice, the daughter of Seleucus IV the king of the Seleucid Empire. Perseus&#x27; daughter was set to marry Prusias II of Bithynia (in north-western Anatolia, modern Turkey), who was an enemy of Eumenes II of Pergamon (in western Anatolia), an ally of Rome.

Amid these alliances, Abrupolis, the king of the Thracian tribe of the Sapaei and an ally of the Romans attacked Macedon, laid it waste as far as Amphipolis, and overran the gold mines of Mount Pangaeus. He was repulsed and then driven out of his territories by Perseus. This conflict contributed to the tensions that led to war, because Rome took issue with the ousting of its ally.

Perseus made an alliance with Cotys IV, the king of the Odrysian kingdom, the largest state in Thrace. He enlarged his army. He also announced that he could carry out reforms in Greece and restore its previous strength and prosperity. Perseus sent agents to seek support in the Greek states and cities. He gained the support of Greeks who were treated generously, saw Perseus as their kindred, were keen on revolutionary change, or did not want to be at Rome&#x27;s mercy. Perseus&#x27; propaganda and political manoeuvres around Greece created bitter disputes between pro-Roman and pro-Perseus factions.

At the beginning of 173 BC, the Romans sent commissioners to Aetolia and Macedonia, but they were not given the opportunity to meet Perseus. The Romans surmised that he was preparing for war. Aetolian cities experienced increasingly violent internal conflicts. A Roman envoy attended the session of the Aetolian council at Delphi. He asked both factions to abstain from war. This was agreed through an exchange of hostages, who were sent to Corinth. The envoy then went to the Peloponnese and called a meeting of the Achaean council. He praised the Achaeans for retaining an old decree forbidding the Macedonian kings to approach their territories, and emphasized that Rome considered Perseus an enemy. Violent conflict erupted in Thessaly and Perrhaebia (the land of the Perrhaebi, a tribe in northern Thessaly). This was exacerbated by a debt problem. Rome sent an envoy to try to defuse the situation. He managed to do so by addressing indebtedness &quot;swollen by illegal interest&quot; in both areas.

Eumenes II of Pergamon, who had been in conflict with Macedon and who disliked Perseus, made a speech in the Roman senate with the aim of precipitating hostilities. The contents of the speech were kept secret and emerged only after war&#x27;s end. He claimed that Perseus had been preparing for war since the day of his accession. He was respected and feared in the east and had influence on many kings. He mentioned Prusias of Bithynia, who was an enemy of Pergamon, asking for the hand of Perseus’ daughter. He also mentioned that Antiochus IV, the new Seleucid king, betrothed his daughter to Perseus as an example of Perseus gaining influence among kings in the east, even though Antiochus had just renewed his father&#x27;s alliance with Rome. The Boeotians had never made an alliance with Macedon. Members of the Achaean council threatened to call on Rome in their opposition to an alliance with Perseus. If not for this, such an alliance might have happened. Perseus made preparations for war, storing corn for 30,000 troops. He had money to hire 10,000 mercenaries and could draw many soldiers from Thrace. He had been stocking weapons. He seized some places and persuaded others through favour. Eumenes II claimed that if Rome ignored these developments, Perseus might attack Italy.

A few days after Eumenes&#x27; speech, the senate received envoys from Perseus. They said that Perseus had not said or done anything hostile. However, the senators did not believe this and &quot;their ears had been captured by Eumenes&quot;. They felt affronted when the leader of the embassy said that if Perseus saw that the Romans were bent on an excuse for war, he would respond with courage and that &quot;the chances of war were the same for both sides and the issue was uncertain.&quot; When they returned to Macedon they told Perseus that the Romans were not preparing for war, but they were so embittered with him that they might do so soon. Perseus thought that this might be possible. He was determined to begin the war by shedding the blood of Eumenes, whom he hated, and called for Euander, a leader of Cretan mercenaries, and three Macedonian killers to arrange Eumenes&#x27; assassination.

The cities of Greece and western and central Anatolia became convinced that Eumenes was steering Rome towards war. They sent emissaries to Rome. One of them was from Rhodes. It said that they felt sure that Eumenes had included Rhodes among those he accused of being friends of Perseus and, therefore, Rhodes had tried to confront Eumenes in the Roman senate. As this had failed, they accused Eumenes of trying to stir the Lycians (a people in western Anatolia under Eumenes&#x27; rule) against Rhodes and claimed that he was more oppressive than the Seleucid king. The senators resented this claim. Hostility towards Eumenes by various Greek states made Rome more determined to favour him.

The plan to assassinate Eumenes failed during his visit to Delphi. Gaius Valerius Laevinus, who had been sent to investigate the situation in Greece and monitor Perseus, returned to Rome and supported Eumenes&#x27; allegations. He also bought a woman who was involved in the failed plot and a Roman who claimed that Perseus had tried to coerce him into poisoning ambassadors to Rome. Perseus was declared a public enemy, the Senate elected to wage war and dispatched an army to Apollonia on the western coast of Greece to occupy the coastal cities. The war was, however, put off. Eumenes also prepared for war.

Gentius, king of the Illyrians, brought himself under suspicion, but had not gone so far as to decide which side to support. The Thracian Cotys IV, king of the Odrysian Kingdom, the largest state in Thrace, had already declared for Macedon.

== Preparations ==
The consuls for 171 BC were Publius Licinius Crassus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Macedon was assigned to Publius Licinius and the command of the fleet was assigned to praetor Gaius Lucretius.

Two legions were assigned for Macedon, each number 6,000 instead of the usual 5,200. Allied troops numbering 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry accompanied them. Envoys were sent to confer with the Greek states. They received the support of Epirus, in western Greece, and Aetolia and Thessaly, in central Greece. The main Boeotian cities, though divided between a pro-Roman and a pro-Perseus faction, decided to break the treaty with Perseus to side with Rome. This broke up the league of Boeotian cities as some of them supported Perseus. In Rhodes a new leader, and some locally notable citizens such as Astymedes, persuaded the island to ally with Rome. Gentius, the king of Illyria, remained non–committal.

A commission was sent to Greece. Perseus invited one of the commissioners, Marcius, for a meeting. He denounced Eumenes&#x27; allegations and others and claimed that his international relations were not aimed at preparing for war. Marcius advised him to send an embassy to Rome and arranged an armistice to guarantee safe passage. He did this because Rome was not ready for war. The army was preparing and had not yet gone to Greece.

Many senators were pleased with the commissioners&#x27; diplomatic achievements. However, the older senators disapproved of the new policy of diplomacy, which they saw as not reflecting Romans&#x27; honour and courage and called for military action. As a result, 50 ships were sent to Greece and 2,000 troops were sent to occupy Larissa, the capital of Thessaly, to prevent Perseus from garrisoning it. Perseus&#x27; ambassadors arrived in Rome to argue for peace. The senate was not persuaded and they were ordered to leave Rome.

Fleet commander Gaius Lucretius set off with 40 ships. He received ten vessels from allies in southern Illyria at Dyrrhachium (modern Durrës, Albania) and 54 light vessels from Gentius, which he assumed had been assembled for the Romans. He reached Cephallania (Cephalonia, an island in the Ionic Sea) where he was joined by seven ships from Roman allies. He then went to Corfu. The consul crossed the sea from Italy and encamped with his force near Apollonia.

Perseus assembled his whole army at Citium. He had 39,000 infantry, half of which were phalanxes (heavy infantry). The force included 3,000 Cretans, 3,000 men from Agrianes, Paeonia and Parstrymonia (a Thracian area around the River Strymon, in modern Bulgaria), 3,000 Thracians, 2,000 Gauls, 3,000 Macedonian cavalry, 1,000 Thracian cavalry, and 500 men from various Greek states.

==Year one (171 BC)==
Perseus marched to Perrhaebi in the northernmost district of Thessaly and seized the main towns north of the River Peneus, which crosses northern Thessaly: Cyretiae, Mylae, Elatia and Gonnus. He encamped at Sycurium, between Mount Ossa and the lower Peneus. It overlooked the plains of Thessaly and was not far from Larissa. Meanwhile, Publius Licinius had marched from Epirus on the west coast of Greece through arduous mountain passes and through Athamania, a kingdom allied with Perseus. He was lucky that they were not attacked, otherwise the green troops tired from their journey would have been defeated. He reached Thessaly and encamped at Tripolis Larisaia, five kilometres north of Larissa and further up the Peneus. He was joined by 4,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry brought by Eumenes II of Pergamon and 1,500 infantry and 600 cavalry.

A contingent of the Roman fleet went through the Gulf of Corinth and fought the Boeotians. It besieged Haliartus with 10,000 mariners and 2,000 troops under one of the brothers of Eumenes II. Eventually the city fell; 2,500 fighters who had taken refuge in the citadel were sold as slaves and the town was razed.

Perseus sent a detachment twenty miles southward, to ravage the fields of Pherae, in southern Thessaly. He hoped that this would draw the Romans forward, but they did not respond. Perseus then appeared just over a mile from the Roman camp and sent forward a reconnaissance unit of 100 cavalry and 100 slingers. The Romans sent out a detachment of some 380 Gallic, Mysian and Cretan light cavalry. Perseus deployed only four cavalry squadrons and four infantry cohorts, and engaged the Roman detachment. Livy wrote that as the two forces were equal in numbers and &quot;no fresh troops came up on either side, the engagement ended in a drawn battle&quot;. Perseus then returned to Sycurium. Neither side wanted a large-scale battle and for Perseus, this was something of a test. Moreover, his men had marched for twelve miles without water. Perseus returned the next day, bringing water carts. He lined up before the Roman camp, but the Romans did not give battle. He returned several times to the same spot and at the same hour. He hoped that the Roman cavalry would pursue his troops, so that he could attack it with his superior cavalry while it was away from the Roman camp. As this failed, he moved his camp five miles away from the Roman camp. The next day, he lined up for battle at dawn. As this was earlier than he had usually done, it surprised the Romans. Perseus engaged the Romans by a hill called Callinicus.

===Battle of Callinicus===

Perseus&#x27; left wing included Thracians intermixed with cavalry and the right wing consisted of Cretan infantry intermixed with Macedonian cavalry. The wings were flanked by a mix of Macedonian cavalry and allied troops of various nationalities. The centre held the “sacred” cavalry fronted by slingers and javelin throwers. Publius Licinius lined up the heavy infantry inside the rampart and the light infantry and the cavalry in front of it. The right wing had light infantry intermixed with Roman cavalry and the left wing had light infantry and cavalry of Greek allies. In the centre were select cavalry with Eumenes&#x27; troops, 200 Gauls and 300 Cyrtians. The Thessalian cavalry of 400 was a short distance in front of them. Eumenes, his brother Attalus, and their infantry were in the rear, just in front of the rampart. The armies&#x27; numbers were even.

The battle was started by the slingers and javelin throwers. Then the Thracians attacked the Roman cavalry on the right wing, throwing it into confusion. The infantry on both sides cut the lances of the horsemen and stabbed the sides of the horses. Perseus’ centre pushed back the Greeks on the left wing. The Thessalian cavalry, which had been kept in reserve, joined the Eumenes&#x27; men at the rear and their combined ranks provided a safe retreat for the allied cavalry. As the enemy&#x27;s pursuit slackened, the Thessalians ventured forward to protect the retreat. The Macedonian forces, which had become spread out, did not close with the enemy, which was advancing in compact formation. The Macedonian phalanx now came forward without Perseus&#x27; orders. The Roman infantry came out of the rampart. On seeing it advancing, Cretan commander Euander advised Perseus that continuing the battle was an unnecessary risk, and the king decided to withdraw. Despite this, the battle was considered a Macedonian victory because they lost 400 infantry and 20 cavalry, while the Romans lost 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. On Eumenes advice, Publius Licinius moved his camp across the river for protection. In the Roman camp the Aetolians were blamed for beginning the panic that spread to the Greek troops, who fled following their example. Five Aetolian officers were sent to Rome. The Thessalians were commended for their bravery.

Perseus moved his camp to Mopselus, a hill at the entrance of the Vale of Tempe that commanded the plain of Larissa. Meanwhile, Misagenes (the son of Masinissa, king of Numidia) brought 1,000 Numidian cavalry, the same number of infantry and 22 elephants for the Romans. Perseus was advised to use the victory to secure an honourable peace. This would make him look moderate and if the Romans rejected it, they would look arrogant. Perseus approved. Envoys were sent to the consul. They promised to pay tribute which would be negotiated. The reply was that peace would be granted only if Perseus put himself in the hands of Rome and gave her the right to determine his future and that of Macedon. Perseus hoped to buy the peace by various offers of higher and higher sums of money, but Publius Licinius turned them down. Perseus returned to Sycurium, preparing to resume hostilities. Meanwhile, the Romans in Boeotia, having taken Haliartus, moved to Thebes, which surrendered without fighting. The city was given to the pro-Roman party and the property of the pro-Macedonians was sold.

Perseus viewed the fact that the Romans were harvesting corn and dumping straw in front of their camp was a good opportunity to torch the camp. However, his night incursion was discovered. Perseus withdrew amidst skirmishes with pursuing Romans. The Romans moved to Crannon (modern Krannonas, to the south-east of Larissa) to reap more corn. They saw Perseus’ cavalry and infantry on the hills overlooking the camp. As the Romans did not move, he returned to Sycurium.

The Romans moved to Phalanna (the capital of the Perrhaebi of northern Thessaly) for further harvesting. Perseus learned that they were dispersed and that no one was guarding the camp. He hurried with 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 Thracian and Cretan light infantry and caught the Romans by surprise. He captured nearly 1,000 carts and 600 men. Then he attacked a detachment of 800 Romans, which withdrew on a hill and formed a circle with interlocked shields to protect against javelins. The Macedonians surrounded the hill, but could not make their way up. The Macedonians used cestrosphendons, a weapon that had just been invented. It was like a dart with feathers round the shaft shot by a sling held by two thongs. The slinger whirled it and it flew off. The Romans were getting tired and Perseus urged them to surrender. Pulbius Licinius was informed and he responded with a force of light infantry and cavalry, including the Numidians and the elephants, followed by more troops.

Perseus called in the heavy infantry, but it was too late. They arrived in a hurry and were not properly arrayed. Publius Licinius attacked and Perseus lost 300 men and 24 of the “sacred” cavalry, including its commander. The heavy infantry fled, but got tangled with the captured Romans and their carts in a narrow passage. Unable to get through, the men threw the carts down the hill. The king showed up and, to the soldiers’ dismay, ordered them to march back. Livy noted that according to some sources the consul returned to his camp, while according to others a big battle ensued in which 8,000 enemies were killed, including two commanders, and 2,800 were captured, while Romans lost 4,300 men.

Perseus left a strong garrison in Gonnus and returned to Macedon for the winter. He sent a governor to Phila to try to win over the Magnetes (a tribe to the east of Thessaly) and went to Thessalonica with king Cotys IV, the Thracians&#x27; commander. They heard that Autlebis, the chief of a Thracian tribe (possibly the Caeni) and Corrhagus, one of Eumenes&#x27; commanders, had invaded one of Cotys&#x27; territories. Perseus let Cotys go to defend it and gave his cavalry only half of the year&#x27;s pay. Publius Licinius heard that Perseus had gone, and launched a failed attack on Gonnus in order to deny the Macedonians a convenient descent into Thessaly. He took towns in Perrhaebia, including Malloea and Tripolis, and returned to Larissa.

The consul sent part of the army to various cities to winter, disbanded the forces of the Greek allies except for the Achaeans and sent Misagenes and his Numidians to the nearest cities in Thessaly. Eumenes and Attalus returned to Pergamon. He then went with part of his army south to Achaean Phthiotis where he razed Pteleum. Antronae surrendered. Livy wrote that then he went to Larissa, that the Macedonian garrison had fled and that the inhabitants, who had taken refuge in the citadel, surrendered. Oddly, he had not previously mentioned that Larissa had been taken by the Macedonians. After this Publius Licinius went to Boeotia, where Thebes was in trouble with another Boeotian city, Coronea, and asked for help.

The commander sent to Illyria by the consul attacked two towns. He seized Cerenia and initially allowed the inhabitants to keep their belongings, in order to encourage the strongly fortified city of Carnuns to go over to him. However, he did not succeed and later sacked Cerenia. The other consul, Gaius Crassus, achieved little in northern Italy and unsuccessfully tried to go to Illyria and attack Macedon. The senate was astonished that he had left northern Italy exposed to possible attacks and sent envoys to warn him not to attack anyone without authorisation.

==Year two (170 BC)==
Livy wrote that Publius Licinius, frustrated with his lack of success, turned against the Boeotians, mercilessly plundering several cities there, where he was wintering. The people of Coronea put themselves under the protection of the Senate, which ordered Licinius to release his captives. Gaius Lucretius was even more ruthless and rapacious, described by Livy as “oppressive to the allies, despicable in the sight of the enemy&quot;. Perseus, in a surprise attack on the Roman fleet stationed at Oreum on the island of Euboea, captured five warships and twenty transports laden with corn, and sunk the other ships. He then went to Thrace to help Cotys. Epirus, on the west coast of Greece, went over to the Macedonians.

The consuls for 170 BC were Aulus Hostilius Mancinus and Aulus Atilius Serranus. Macedon was assigned to Aulus Hostilius and the fleet and the coast of Greece to the praetor Gaius Hortensius.

Aulus Hostilius was on his way to Macedon via Epirus. An Epirot leader wrote to Perseus to tell him to hurry there. However, the king was delayed. If he had attacked at the river passage, the newly recruited troops would have been defeated. In any case, Aulus Hostilius was informed and changed his route. He left Epirus and sailed to Anticyra (on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, in Boeotia) and marched to Thessaly. He immediately marched, but he was defeated. He gave up his useless attempts first to force his way through Elimea in south-western Macedon and secretly marched through Thessaly. Perseus anticipated his moves. Livy wrote that Gaius Hortensius did not conduct his naval operations “with sufficient skill or success, for none of his acts deserves better to be remembered than his cruel and perfidious plundering of the city of the Abderites when they endeavoured to avert, by entreaty, the intolerable burdens imposed on them&quot;. Perseus made an incursion against Dardania in southern Illyria, killed 10,000 and seized a large booty.

An embassy from Chalcis (chief town of Euboea) came to Rome to complain about Gaius Lucretius (for plundering the city, a friend of Rome), and the current commander, Lucius Hortensius, for keeping the rowdy sailors in the town. Lucretius was put on trial and fined by the plebeian tribunes; the senate ordered Hortensius to free the men enslaved by Lucretius and to move the sailors off the island.

It was suspected that Gentius might side with Perseus. Therefore, the senate sent eight ships with 2,000 soldiers to Issa. Aulus Hostilius sent Appius Claudius to Illyria with 4,000 men to protect the neighbouring states. He gathered 8,000 soldiers and sent them to Lychnidus, in the territory of the Dassaretians, a tribe in Epirus. Messengers from the nearby Uscana—a town allied with Perseus and garrisoned by Cretans—told Appius Claudius that some people in the town were willing to hand it over to him. He neither asked for hostages as a safeguard nor sent scouts. He encamped near the city and set out at night, leaving 1,000 men to guard the camp. The troops were not well organised, stretched out in a long and irregular line. They became separated in the dark. They did not see anyone on the walls as they approached. However, the defenders made a sortie, killing many of the Romans; only 1,000 escaped. Appius took the remains of his force to Lychnidus without taking care of the stragglers.

This and other reverses were reported to Rome. The senate ordered two deputies to gather information on the situation in Greece. The deputies reported the successes of Perseus and the fear of the Greek allies about Perseus reducing many cities. They also reported that Publius Licinius&#x27; troops were, thin because he had granted leave to many of them, in order to gain popularity.

== Year three(169 BC) ==
===Opening Stages===
The consuls for 169 BC were Quintus Marcius Philippus (for the second time) and Gnaeus Servilius Caepio. The Macedonian War was assigned to Quintus Marcius and the command of the fleet to praetor Quintus Marcius Figulus. The troops allocated for Greece were 6,000 Roman infantry, 6,000 Latin infantry, 250 Roman cavalry and 300 allied cavalry. The old soldiers were discharged, so each legion had 6,000 soldiers. The soldiers granted leave were recalled. The recruitment for the fleet was 1,000 Roman freedmen and 500 Italians and 500 Sicilians.

When the snow covered the mountains of Thessaly, thus protecting Macedon from Roman attacks, Perseus attacked the Illyrians, who had granted free passage to the Romans. King Gentius had been wavering about whom to support. Perseus moved to the land of the Penestae (in southern Illyria) and went on to Stubera with 10,000 infantry, 2,000 light infantry, and 500 cavalry. From there, he marched on Uscana. In his discussion of the war&#x27;s third year, Livy stated that Uscana apparently switched allegiance to Rome. The mixed Roman and Illyrian garrison refused to surrender and Perseus besieged it. The defending commanders soon capitulated, and asked to be allowed to leave with their weapons. Perseus agreed, but then disarmed them. He moved the population to Stubera and sold them as slaves. The 4,000 enemy troops were sent to various towns. He then marched on Draudacum, whose garrison surrendered, and then took eleven forts, capturing 1,500 Romans. He seized Oaeneus, killed the men and put the women and children in custody. He sent envoys to Gentius, to seek an alliance. Gentius said he did not have enough money for war. Perseus, who had a reputation as a miser, sent the envoys back but did not mention money, even though he had the proceeds from the slave sale. Perseus ravaged Ancrya, returned to Uscana, fortifying it, and then returned to Macedon.

Lucius Coelius, a commander in Illyria, remained inactive while Perseus was there. After Perseus returned to Macedon, Coelius tried to recover Uscana, but was repulsed and returned to Lychnidus. He sent a detachment to the area to receive the hostages from the cities which had remained loyal (they were sent to Apollonia) and from the Parthini (a tribe of southern Illyria), who were sent to Dyrrhachium (modern Durrës, Albania). Perseus was invited by the Epirots to attack Aetolia and marched on Stratus, the strongest Aetolian city, with 10,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. He could not pitch camp on the snow-covered Mount Citium and had to encamp elsewhere. He then was held up at the River Aracthus because of its deep water. He built a bridge, crossed, and then met Archidamus, a distinguished Aetolian, who had persuaded the nobles to betray Stratus. However, while he was away, the pro-Roman faction called in a Roman garrison. Dinarchus, the commander of the Aetolian cavalry, also arrived with 600 infantry and 100 cavalry to support Perseus, but when he saw the changed situation he switched allegiance to Rome. Due to the winter weather, Perseus abandoned Stratus, and went to Aperantia, which, through the influence of Archidamus, willingly surrendered. Archidamus was made its governor, while Perseus returned to Macedon.

Appius Claudius was eager make up for his defeat in Illyria and attacked a stronghold in Epirus. He had a force of 6,000, Romans and contingents of Thesprotians and from Chaon (both from Epirus). He was repulsed by the garrison. He besieged the city, but then lifted it due to a report that Perseus was marching there. He was pursued up an almost impassable mountain and lost 1,000 men, in addition to 200 captured. He then encamped on the plain. The pursuers were joined by an Epirot force that ravaged the area; 1,000 troops of the city of Antigonea were killed and 100 were captured in an ambush. They then encamped near Appius Claudius, who decided to go back to Illyria. He sent the soldiers to winter camps and returned to Rome.

===Spring Campaign===
In early spring consul Quintus Marcius sailed with 5,000 men to reinforce his legions. They disembarked at Ambracia and moved towards Thessaly. Figulus took his fleet into the Gulf of Corinth. He left his ships at Creusis and traveled to join the fleet stationed at Chalcis overland. Aulus Hostilius, who had been protecting Rome&#x27;s allies, had restored discipline in his troops and was encamped in Thessaly; he handed over his troops and returned to Rome. The consul started marching towards Macedon. Perseus sent troops to the mountain passes into Macedon.

Quintus Marcius carried out a heroic march into Macedon through the Olympus mountains . He sent 4,000 light infantry ahead to secure the road to a pass near Octolophus, but the road was so difficult and steep that they advanced only fifteen miles and seven miles the following day. They spotted an enemy camp guarding the pass. Quintus Marcius stopped on a hill, which gave a wide view and ordered one day&#x27;s rest. The next day he attacked with half his troops. The enemy had seen the Roman camp and was ready. The narrow ridge allowed for the deployment of only small numbers of light troops and so the engagement was limited to a skirmish. Perseus, who was not far, did not intervene or send more troops. Despite the presence of the enemy, Quintus Marcius had no choice but to persist. Leaving some troops to guard the summit, he marched across trackless places, having sent forward a party to open a road, with allied troops protecting them while clearing the way through the forests. Marcius kept the cavalry and baggage before him and closed the rear with his legions. The descent from the hill felled pack animals. Elephants threw off their riders and roared loudly, frightening the horses. A series of bridges (made with two long posts fastened to the earth to which ten-yard-long beams were attached) was made where the rocks were steep, in order to help the elephants. The Romans advanced only seven miles, and then waited for the troops at the camp to join them. On the fourth day they reached a pass and encountered similarly difficult terrain. As they approached the plain troops encamped between Heracleum and Libethrus, while some occupied a valley and part of the plain. The greater part was on hillsides.

Perseus panicked. He evacuated the area and its strong posts, leaving them to the Romans, even though the area was easily defensible. He ordered the inhabitants of Dium, where he was encamped, to move to Pydna and moved his statues there. Quintus Marcius advanced, facing a difficult decision. The Romans could leave the area only through two passes: through the Vale of Tempe to Thessaly or on to Macedon by way of Dium, and both were guarded. The Romans could not withdraw to Thessaly lest they cut their supply lines. Furthermore, the Vale of Tempe was a difficult passage, dangerous even if not guarded. The precipices on both sides were steep and the passage was so narrow that it barely allowed a loaded horse. To make matters worse, guard detachments occupied four places along the pass. One was at the entrance, another in a thick forest and the third on the road where the valley was narrowest (Livy did not specify the characteristics of the fourth). The only way to retreat or receive supplies was to recross the mountains, but they were also difficult. It was also hard to pass unnoticed as the enemy was posted on the heights. The only option was the area between the bottom of Mount Olympus and the sea, but that was only one mile wide, half of which was the bog of the mouth of the River Baphirus and a large part of the remaining plain was taken up by the town. The small remaining space could easily closed by a short rampart with towers; construction material was abundant.

=== Thessaly campaign ===
Quintus Marcius ordered Spurius Lucretius, who was in Larissa, to capture the deserted forts around Vale of Tempe. He sent scouts to check the roads around Dium and then he marched to the city. It was so rich and well-fortified that Quintus Marcius could not believe his luck that it had been evacuated. He continued his march, forcing the surrender of Agasse. To get a good reputation he did not garrison it and did not ask for taxes. He moved on to the river Ascordus, but, as he got further away from the supplies from Thessaly, plunder became scant and provisions were scarce, so he returned to Dium. The Roman fleet arrived, but he was told that the transport ships were in Magnesia, further south. He was informed by Lucretius that the forts he had taken were stocked with corn. Quintus Marcius moved his headquarters to Phila to distribute corn to the soldiers. Livy noted allegations that he had withdrawn because of fear that had he stayed he would have had to risk battle, and that he let his gains slip. With his withdrawal Perseus marched back to Dium, rebuilt the fortifications the Romans had pulled down, and encamped on the bank of the Enipeus to use it as a defence. Meanwhile, Quintus Marcius sent 2,000 men from Phila to seize Heracleum, halfway between Dium and the Vale of Tempe, and moved his quarters there, as if he intended to besiege Dium. Instead, he prepared for the winter and had roads built for the transport of supplies from Thessaly.

Figulus sailed from Heracleum to Thessalonica. He pillaged the countryside and repulsed sorties from the towns, employing naval catapults. After this, the troops were re-embarked, and he made for Aenia, fifteen miles away, and pillaged its fertile countryside. He then sailed to Antigonea and did the same, but a Macedonian detachment intercepted the troops and killed 500 men. Another fight by the coast, assisted by men from the ships, had the Romans kill 200 enemies. The fleet sailed on to the district of Pallene (Chalkidiki peninsula), whose territory was by far the most plentiful. There, Figulus was joined by 20 ships from Eumenes II and five ships from Prusias I of Bithynia. This encouraged him to besiege Cassandrea, which connected the Pallene peninsula (one of the three long peninsulas that extend from the Chalkidiki peninsula) to the territory. An attack was repulsed by the city garrison. The arrival of a Macedonian ship from Thessalonica with Gallic auxiliaries ended the siege. The Romans and Eumenes considered besieging Torone, but changed their minds because of its garrison. They went on Demetrias, but they saw that the walls were fully manned. Thus, they brought the fleet into harbour at Iolcos, after pillaging the countryside.

To remain active, Quintus Marcius sent 5,000 men to Meliboea by Mount Ossa, where it stretches out into Thessaly to command Demetrias. Works for a siege started. Perseus heard about this attack and sent one of his commanders with 2,000 men. His instructions were that if he could not dislodge the Romans at Meliboea he was to march on Demetrias before Figulus and Eumenes moved there from Iolcos. When the Romans at Meliboea saw him arriving they burnt the siege works and left. The Macedonians hurried to Demetrias. Figulus and Eumenes reached the walls of the city. Negotiations between Eumenes and Antimachus were rumoured, via the governor of the city and a Cretan, Cydas. Ultimately, the Romans left. Eumenes sailed to visit the consul and then returned to Pergamon. Figulus sent part of the fleet to winter at Sciatus and went to Oreum in Euboea with the rest of the fleet because it was a better base from which to supply Macedon and Thessaly. Livy noted different accounts about Eumenes. According to one he did not assist Figulus, even though he had asked for it. When he left for Pergamon he was not on good terms with the consul. Quintus Marcius could not get him to leave his Gallic cavalry behind.

Ambassadors from Bithynia and from Rhodes went to Rome to propose peace. The Bithynians said that their king had promised Perseus to mediate for peace and asked the senate to give him this role. The Rhodians said that during the interwar period they had started a friendship with Perseus which they broke unwillingly because Rome wanted to draw them into an alliance. Now the war disrupted their trade, brought losses in port duties and in provisions and caused scarcity on the island. They said that they wanted peace and that they had also sent envoys to Perseus. They would consider what measures to take against either party who insisted on carrying on the war. This message was considered arrogant. Livy cited one source claiming it was ignored while others wrote that the senate replied that the Rhodians and Perseus had conspired against Rome and that the words of the ambassadors confirmed this. Once Perseus had been defeated, Rome would consider retribution.

==Year four (168 BC)==
The consuls for 168 BC were Lucius Aemilius Paulus (for the second time) and Gaius Licinius Crassus. Macedon was assigned to Lucius Aemilius and the command of the fleet was assigned to the praetor Gnaeus Octavius. The praetor Lucius Anicius was put in charge of Illyria.

===Preparations ===
Aemilius carefully prepared his campaign. He asked for a commission to find out if the troops were still in the mountains or had descended to the plain, to inspect the armies and the fleet, to report on what was required, whether the allies were still loyal, which states were hostile, the status of Perseus’ troops, and the logistics. They reported that the Romans had advanced towards Macedon, but that travel mountains had proven costly. Perseus was still holding his country and the two forces were close to each other. The Romans had rations for only six days. The Roman position in Illyria was perilous and needed to be reinforced or withdrawn. A strong enough army there could open a second front. Some of the fleet&#x27;s crew had died of disease and some had gone home, leaving the ships undermanned; also, the men did not have proper clothing and had not received their pay. The senate decided that two new legions of 5,000 infantry each were to be taken to Macedon. The men in Macedon who were unfit for service were to be discharged, the two legions there were to have 6,000 infantry each and the rest of the men were to be sent to the various garrisons. The forces of the Roman allies were to be 10,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. For the fleet 5,000 sailors were to be levied.

===Perseus&#x27; opportunities===
A year earlier Gentius was invited to join Macedon in an alliance. He had told Perseus that he did not have money for war. When he felt pressured by the Romans, he offered Gentius 300 silver talents if hostages were exchanged. Perseus sent an envoy to Gentius who gave him his sworn sword and the hostages. Gentius sent an envoy of his to Perseus to get his sworn sword, the hostages and the talents, which was to be collected by men who accompanied him. After receiving all of these he was to travel to Rhodes with Macedonian envoys to deliver a plea by the two kings for Rhodes and her powerful navy to join them against the Romans. Perseus went to meet the Illyrians, the hostages were exchanged and the treaty concluded. The men who were to receive the money were sent to the royal treasury in Pella. The Illyrian and Macedonian ambassadors were ordered to board a ship at Thessalonica, where they were joined by a Rhodian who stated that the Rhodians were ready for war; he was made head of the joint delegation. Perseus let the Illyrians in Pella take the talents and had 10 talents sent to Gentius. However, he got his men to carry the money and told them to proceed slowly and to wait for his instructions when they reached the border. Gentius, who had received only a small part of the money, was urged to provoke the Romans into an attack. As a result, he imprisoned two Roman envoys. Perseus, believing that Gentius had now been pushed into war with Rome, told the couriers to take the money back to his treasury. Livy wrote that, through his avarice, Perseus had lost an alliance with Gentius backed by large army of Gauls. When the Macedonian and Illyrian envoys reached Rhodes, the Rhodians thought that Perseus and Gentius were still allies and that the Gauls had been hired. This strengthened the leaders of the pro-Macedonian faction who declared that Rhodes had sufficient authority to put an end to the war and that the kings had to accede to peace.

Perseus also sent a common message to Eumenes II and Antiochus IV, which invited them to pressure the Romans for peace talks. The message to Antiochus was sent openly. The one to Eumenes was sent under the pretence of ransoming prisoners. Secret deals transpired between the two that raised suspicions in Rome and triggered accusations that Eumenes II was a traitor. This was also related to Cydas, who was Eumenes&#x27; close friend. He went to meet a countryman who served Perseus at Amphipolis, in Macedon, and then had conversations with two of Perseus&#x27; officers at Demetrias. He had gone to Eumenes as an envoy twice. The fact that these secretive missions had taken place was notorious, but the precise nature of their dealings was not known.

Perseus also approached Eumenes II of Pergamon directly, even though he was an enemy of Macedon. Eumenes knew that Perseus pursued peace. He also thought that as the war dragged on the Romans would be interested in bringing it to an end. He wanted to win their good graces by helping them to secure what he thought would come about of itself. He asked a price on 1,000 talents for not helping the Romans by land or sea and 15,000 talents for mediating peace. Perseus agreed to send his hostages to Crete. He said that he would pay the money only when the deal was complete and that meanwhile he would send it to Samothrace, an island which belonged to him. Eumenes agreed, but asked for part of the sum immediately. He struggled to obtain it. Livy commented that “having manoeuvred with each other to no purpose, they gained nothing but disgrace”, and that, but for a small amount of money, Perseus missed a chance for successful peace talks or, had they failed, the ignition of hostilities between Rome and Eumenes.

Through avarice Perseus also lost a chance to hire Gallic mercenaries. A body on infantry and cavalry of Gauls who lived in the Balkans offered its services to Perseus for money. Perseus went to one of his camps with a small amount of gold to give to a few of the men hoping that this would entice the others. He got an envoy to tell the Gauls to move their camp to a place near Macedon. The Gauls asked whether the gold had been brought. There was no reply and they said that they would not move unless they received the gold. Perseus gave his officers the excuse that the Gauls were savages and that he would hire only 5,000 cavalry, which were enough for war and not too many to be dangerous, in order to justify not wanting to spend money on the whole of the Gallic body. When the Gauls heard that only 5,000 cavalry and no infantry were going to be hired, the rest of their army was disgruntled. The Gallic chieftain asked whether the 5,000 men would receive the agreed pay, but received an evasive answer. The Gauls left, devastating part of Thrace as they went. Livy thought that this large force of effective fighters could have been used effectively in combined operations with the forces of Perseus, which could have put the Romans in an untenable position.

===War in Illyria===
Gentius assembled his entire force of 15,000 at Lissus and sent his brother Caravantius with 1,000 infantry and 50 cavalry to subdue the Cavii while he besieged Bassania, five miles away, which was an ally of Rome. Durnium opened its gates while Caravandis closed them and Caravantius ravaged the fields. The peasants killed many of the scattered plunderers. Appius Claudius had strengthened his army with units of Bulinian, Apollonian, and Dyrrhachian contingents and left his winter quarters. He was encamped near the river Genusus. Praetor Lucius Anicius had arrived in Apollonia and sent a letter to Appius, asking him to wait for him. Three days after, he arrived at the camp with 2,000 infantry and 200 Parthinian cavalry. He prepared to march into Illyria to relieve Bassania. However, he was delayed by a report that 80 enemy boats were ravaging the coast. The relevant passage of Livy is missing, but it can be deduced that he defeated this fleet (presumably, the Roman fleet was nearby), that he moved on to Bassania and that Gentius fled to Scodra, the most strongly fortified city in the area and was protected by two rivers and the whole of the Illyrian army. Despite this, Lucius Anicius prepared for battle by the city walls. Instead of manning the walls, which would have given them an advantage, the Illyrians marched out and gave battle. They were pushed back and more than 200 men crowded by the gate fell. The Illyrians asked for a truce and were given three days. Gentius then surrendered. A few days later he was sent to Rome.

=== Lucius Aemilius&#x27; campaign ===
Perseus sent 200 cavalry to guard the sea and ordered 200 targeteers in Thessalonica to encamp close to the naval arsenal. He sent 5,000 troops to garrison the mountains of Pythium and Petra, which were close to Thessaly, to guard against a Roman advance. He fortified the banks of the River Elpeus because it was dried and thus easy to pass. Women of nearby cities were ordered to bring provisions. Aemilius encamped nearby.

The envoys from Rhodes arrived at the Roman camp to advocate for peace, but they encountered hostility. Aemilius told them that he would give them an answer in two weeks and discussed battle plans with his war council. He ruled out trying to force a crossing of the river or to get Octavius to devastate the coast near Thessalonica, as he considered the fortifications insurmountable. He heard from two local traders that Perrhaebia (near the Pythian mountain range) was poorly guarded. He thought that a night attack could dislodge the enemy detachments. He sent for Octavius and told him to sail to Heracelum and store ten days’ rations for 1,000 men. He sent Publius Scipio Nasica Corculum there with 5,000 soldiers. He told Nasica privately that this was a pretence: Nasica would board the fleet, as if to raid the coast, but, in fact, he would then disembark and march to the mountains—the rations were for enabling the troops to move faster, without having to forage. Aemilius scheduled the march so that Nasica would reach the Pythian mountains three days later. Livy said that Nasica had 5,000 troops. However, Plutarch noted that Nasica wrote in a letter that he had 5,000 Roman and 3,000 Italian infantry, 120 cavalry and 200 mixed Thracians and Cretans. When he reached Heracleum, Nasica told his officers the real design and moved inland to Pythium. According to Plutarch, he stopped below Pythium while Livy wrote that he reached the summit. Livy wrote that Aemilius sent his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, with Nasica. Plutarch specified that the son volunteered to join the expedition.

Plutarch wrote that Perseus did not know about these movements, because Aemilius remained in his position quietly. Livy did not state this about Perseus and gave an account of Aemilius opening two battles to keep Perseus distracted from the covert operation. Both authors wrote that a Cretan deserter informed Perseus, who sent 2,000 Macedonians and 10,000 mercenaries to Pythium. In Plutarch&#x27;s account they went to occupy the mountain passes. Livy&#x27;s account implies that they were sent to the pass Nasica was to attack, then guarded by 5,000 Macedonian troops. He added that Nasica said that the steep descent would have been so unguarded that it would have been taken without trouble had it not been for the deserter. Both authors noted that Polybius (in a lost part of book 29 of his Histories) stated that Nasica attacked when they were asleep, but that Nasica wrote (in that letter) that in a tough fight he had killed a Thracian mercenary and that their leader disgracefully threw away his armour and cloak and fled. The Romans pursued the enemy to the plain.

Livy described battles fought by the River Elpius. Aemilius offered battle in the morning of the day after Nasica&#x27;s departure. The ground of the river bed was over a mile wide and uneven, which hindered the heavy infantry. The Macedonians hurled javelins and rocks from their rampart. Aemilius withdrew at noon. He attacked again the next morning and withdrew later than the day before. On the third morning, he went to the lowest part of the camp, “as if intending to attempt a passage through an entrenchment which stretched down to the sea …” The rest of this passage is lost. After the defeat at the Pythian mountains, Perseus withdrew to Pydna, pitching camp in the plain between the rivers Aeson and Leucus, shallow in the summer, but still deep enough to trouble the Romans. The even ground was favourable for the phalanx. The light infantry could withdraw to nearby hills after harassing the enemy and then to attack again.

Nasica re-joined his commander and Aemilius marched on Pydna, where he lined up the men in battle formation. However, at noon he ordered them to mark the line of a camp and deposit the baggage because it was hot, the men were tired from the march and they were greatly outnumbered. Nasica advised Aemilius to fight. He replied that he had learnt when it was “proper to fight, and when to abstain from fighting.” He had lined up the men to keep the construction of the camp rampart behind them hidden from the enemy. He then withdrew them behind the rampart starting from the rear. Aemilius placed the camp on uneven ground, which left the Macedonian phalanx unable to operate. A veteran officer announced an eclipse for that night, and reassured the soldiers who would have seen it as a portent.

Aemilius performed sacrifices when the moon arose and through most of the next day. Plutarch wrote that this was because, although familiar with eclipses, he was devout and sought divination, not expiation. During the eclipse, he sacrificed eleven heifers to the goddess moon. During the day he sacrificed twenty oxen to Hercules without obtaining favourable omens. With the twenty-first the signs indicated victory if the Romans kept on the defensive. Livy wrote that the officers thought that Aemilius, who had hoisted the battle signal at dawn, was wasting time with these sacrifices.

===The Battle of Pydna===
The battle of Pydna resolved the war decisively in the Romans&#x27; favour. Plutarch noted two versions of the beginning. According to some sources Aemilius goaded the enemy into attacking first; the Romans made a horse without a bridle run to the enemy&#x27;s bank and sent some men to pursue it to provoke an attack. Other sources said that Thracian troops came upon Roman pack animals that were bringing in forage; 700 Ligurians sallied against them. Both parties sent reinforcements, starting a general fight. Aemilius went to the front line with legionaries. Livy recounted the horse version and added that this was because the omens of Aemilius’ last sacrifices said that the Romans would win only if they did not strike the first blow. However, Livy favoured another version and thought that the battle started by happenstance. Both sides collected water from a river closer to the Macedonian camp. The Roman side was protected by Italian allies: two cohorts of Marrucini and Paeligni and two squadrons of Samnite cavalry. More troops (of Vestini and men from Firmum and Cremera) and two cavalry squadrons (of men from Placentia and Aesernia) were stationed in front of the camp. While both sides were quiet, a mule broke loose and escaped towards the enemy&#x27;s bank. Three Italians went into the river to pursue the animal. Two Thracian soldiers dragged it towards their bank. The Italians pursued them and secured the mule, killing one of Thracians, then returned to their post. Some of the 800 Thracians chased the Italians and soon, the rest engaged with the enemy guards. Units from both sides joined in and the king and the consul mobilised their forces. Livy wrote that whether by the design of Aemilius or by accident, this is what sparked the battle.

Aemilius decided to turn an accident into an opportunity and brought his forces into the fight. Nasica told him that Perseus was advancing. The Thracians, flanked by light infantry, formed the first line. Next to them there were mercenaries of various nationalities. The Leucaspides (phalanx with white shields) formed the middle. In the rear there were the Chalcaspides (phalanx with bronze shields), flanked on the right by another phalanx. These two were the main strength of the army. There were also targeteers, who were midway between the phalanx and the light infantry. They had spikes like those of the phalanx but wore light armour. They stood in front of the wings. This army had been so swift that those who were first killed fell close to the Roman camp. A unit of Paelignans from central Italy and those at their rear were routed and the rest of the soldiers in that part of the battlefield withdrew to a hill. Elsewhere the Roman forces were hesitant to confront the long spears of the Macedonian phalanx, which pierced both their shields and armour.

The strength of the Macedonian phalanx relied on keeping its lines compact by interlocking their shields. Aemilius noticed that the phalanx was not compact everywhere and that in some places there were gaps. These were due to the length of its lines, the unevenness of the ground (which caused those on higher ground to become separated from those on the lower ground) and differences between those who were faster and those who were slower or those who were slowed down, pressed by the enemy. Aemilius ordered his cohorts to attack any gaps, however narrow, and slip through like a wedge to break up the ranks of the phalanx and divide the battle into separate confrontations. The wedged-in troops attacked the flank of the phalanx where it was not protected by the spears and the sides of the soldiers was not shielded by their breastplates. They also cut off the lines they attacked by falling on their rear. The efficiency of the phalanx was lost. Forced to engage in man-to-man fights or fights between small detachments, the Macedonians had to turn their spears, which were unwieldy because of their length and weight. They became tangled with each other and lost effectiveness. Their small daggers could not hack the enemy shields or oppose their swords. They were not a firm body anymore and were thrown into disarray.

The legion of Aemilius wedged in between the phalanxes and targeteers and had the targeteers behind and the Chalcaspides in front. Lucius Albinus, a former consul, was sent against the Leucaspides of the centre of the enemy lines. The elephants and the allied cavalry were sent to the right wing, by the river, where the battle began. This was also the area where the Macedonians started to retreat. This attack was followed by an attack on the left wing by the Latin allies, who pushed it back. The second legion charged the centre, broke the lines of the enemy and dispersed it. Plutarch wrote that Marcus, the son of Cato the Elder and Aemilius&#x27; son-in‑law, lost his sword. He rallied his companions to his aid, who put themselves under his leadership, and attacked. They filled gaps that were hidden by hips of fallen bodies. They fought 3,000 elite Macedonians who remained in close ranks and slaughtered them. The battle ended at four o’ clock and was won in one hour. The rest of the day was spent pursuing fugitives over the course of three miles. Plutarch wrote that the Macedonians lost 25,000 men and noted that according to Poseidonius the Romans lost 100 men while according to Nasica they lost 80.

Livy stated that the Macedonians suffered the greatest losses in any battle with the Romans and that if the battle had started earlier, the Romans would have had more daylight time to pursue the Macedonians and all their troops would have been destroyed. The Macedonian wings fled in full ranks. The survivors of the hemmed-in phalanx fled unarmed to the sea. Some went into the water begging the Roman ships to save them. They walked further into the sea or swam towards the boats from the ships, but they were killed. Some headed back to the shore, but they were trampled by the elephants that were moving ashore. The enemy lost 20,000 men, 11,000 were taken captive. The victors lost no more than 100 men, most of whom were Paelignians.

Plutarch recorded that Polybius wrote that Perseus cravenly left the battle immediately and went to the city under the pretext of offering sacrifices to Heracles. Plutarch noted that Poseidonius, who wrote a history of Perseus and said that he participated in the battle, wrote that the king did not leave because cowardice or under the pretence of sacrifices, but because, the day before the battle, he was kicked in the leg by a horse. On the day of the battle, against advice to the contrary, he ordered a pack horse and joined the phalanx without a breastplate. A dart tore his tunic and bruised his skin. Livy, instead, wrote that Perseus was the first to flee the battle with his sacred cavalry squadron. He fled to Pella and was quickly followed by the Thracian cavalry. The Roman forces, busy routing the Macedonian phalanx, were “careless of pursuing the cavalry&quot;.

===Pursuit of Perseus===
Livy wrote that Perseus fled to Pella through the Pierian wood with his cavalry, which had survived the battle almost intact, and the royal retinue. In the darkness he left the main path with a few trusted men. The abandoned cavalrymen returned to their homes. Plutarch, instead, wrote that he came across infantrymen who called the horsemen cowards and traitors and tried to push them off their horses. He turned away from the road, attempting to be inconspicuous. He carried the royal diadem. These ran away because they were afraid of his cruelty. Perseus reached Pella. He was met at the palace by the governor of Pella and the royal pages (Livy) or was met by his treasurers whom he killed because of bold remarks about the defeat (Plutarch). Perseus’ friends, who had escaped to Pella independently, shunned him. Only Euander the Cretan, Archedamus the Aetolian, and Neon the Boeotian remained. Fearing a plot, Perseus continued his escape with an escort of about five hundred Cretans, lured by money. He rushed to cross the river Axius before daylight, because he thought that the Romans would not pursue him beyond this treacherous river. He reached Amphipolis three days after the battle. He sent ambassadors to the Romans. In the meantime, Hippias Milo, and Pantauchus, three of his main friends, had fled to Berœa and surrendered that city and several others. Perseus addressed the people of Amphipolis, but he was met with hostility because of fears that his presence would lead to a Roman attack. He left the city and arrived at Galespus the next day.

In the meantime, Aemilius sent three envoys to Rome to announce the victory. He moved nearer the sea, towards Pydna. Most Macedonian cities surrendered. Pydna had not yet sent ambassadors because military men of different nationalities had fled there and walled the city gates. Milo and Pantauchus were sent to address the situation. The soldiers were sent away and the city was given up for the Roman soldiers to plunder.

Plutarch, who was quite scornful of Perseus, wrote that at Galepsus his fear abated and he reverted to avarice. He claimed that the Cretans had stolen some of the gold plate of Alexander and implored them to exchange it for money. He was playing Cretan against Cretan and those who gave it back to him were cheated. He paid less money than he promised and got the money from his friends. He then sailed to the island of Samothrace where he took refuge as a suppliant in the temple of the Dioscuri, which was a sanctuary.

Perseus’ ambassadors reached Aemilius who, thinking that he was in Amphipolis, sent Nasica there with a detachment to obstruct the king. Meanwhile, Gnaeus Octavius, the Roman naval commander, sacked Melibœa. At Aeginium, which was not aware that the war had ended, the inhabitants sortied against Gnaeus Anicius, who had been sent there, and two hundred men were lost. Aemilius left Pydna for Pella. On receiving intelligence that Perseus had gone to Samothrace, he moved to Amphipolis and then crossed the river Strymon and went to Sirae, where he encamped. Three ambassadors gave Aemilius a letter from Perseus which contained appeals for mercy which in Livy&#x27;s opinion &quot;were anything but kingly.&quot; Aemilus did not reply and Perseus sent another letter in which &quot;he begged most urgently&quot; for envoys to be sent to him to confer. Aemilius sent three men, but nothing came of the meeting; &quot;Perseus clung desperately to his royal title, and [Aemilius] was determined that he should place himself and all that he possessed at the mercy of Rome.&quot; Meanwhile, Gnaeus Octavius, the commander of the Roman fleet, anchored it off Samothrace and, out of respect to the gods and the sanctuary on the island, did not go for Perseus, but took measures to prevent him from escaping by sea and pressured him to surrender.

Lucius Atilius, &quot;a young man of distinction,&quot; was allowed to attend an assembly of the people of the island. He accused Euander, the leader of the Cretan mercenaries, of having attempted to murder king Eumenes II of Pergamon at the sanctuary of Delphi, and called for him to be put on trial. Violence was forbidden at these sacred places. The people of Samothrace, which was also a sanctuary, agreed. If found guilty this would have exposed Perseus as the instigator of the attempted murder. Euander wanted to escape, but Perseus, fearing that the Samothracians would think that he had helped him to escape, had him killed. He then realised that he would be accused of murder in a sanctuary and bribed the leader of the island to say that Euander had committed suicide. However, this alienated the inhabitants, who turned to the Romans. Perseus hired the ship of a Cretan and had all the money he could take secretly transported to the ship at sunset. At midnight he climbed a wall and reached the shore. However, the ship had sailed off as soon as the money was on board. Perseus hid in the temple of Demetrius. Gaius Octavius proclaimed that if the royal pages and all the Macedonians on the island went over to the Romans they would be granted impunity and freedom. They all left Perseus except for his eldest son, Phillip. At this point Perseus surrendered. According to Plutarch, Perseus asked for Nasica, whom he trusted, but he was not there. Thus, he gave himself to Gnaeus Octavius.

Perseus (together with Gentius) was sent to Rome as a prisoner. The motion to award Aemilius a triumph was disputed by an officer who had a personal gripe with him and sought support from the soldiers who felt they had been given less of the share of the booty than they should. Aemilius kept part of this for the treasury. However, the motion was carried and Aemilius celebrated his triumph. Perseus was led in chains in front of the procession and was then kept in custody at Alba Fucens for the rest of his life.

==Aftermath==
Aemilius sent his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who had returned from Rome, to sack Agassae, which revolted after it had surrendered to the consul and asked for an alliance with Rome, and Aeginium, which refused to believe the Roman victory and killed Roman soldiers who entered the town. Lucius Postumius was sent to sack Aeniae &quot;because of its obstinacy&quot;.

Commissioners were sent to Macedon and to Illyria. Livy wrote that the senate resolved that the Macedonians and Illyrians should be free &quot;so that it might be clear to all the world that the arms of Rome did not carry slavery to the free, but on the contrary freedom to the enslaved; and also that amongst those nations which enjoyed liberty, the security and permanence of their liberty rested under the protection of Rome&quot;. This served Romans&#x27; self-image and as propaganda. The contracts for working the rich mines of Macedon and the leases of the royal domains were scrapped and were put under Roman tax collectors. The pretext was that without them “the law lost its authority or the subjects their liberty” and that the Macedonians were unable to work the mines themselves because those in charge would line their pockets and this could cause unrest. Ironically, the Roman tax collectors became notorious for lining their pockets. The Macedonian national council was abolished with the excuse that this was intended to prevent a demagogue from flattering the “mob” and turn the freedom granted by the Romans into a “dangerous and fatal licence.” Macedon was to be divided into four republics, each with its own council which would have to pay Rome a tribute which was half of what used to be paid to the king. The same regulations applied to Illyria. More definite arrangements were to be made by the commissioners.

When the commission arrived from Rome, Aemilius gave notice for the representatives of all the cities to assemble at Amphipolis and bring all the documents they had and all the money due to the Royal treasury. A conference was held amid such a display of pomp and power that Livy wrote that it “might have even appalled the allies of Rome&quot;. It was declared that the Macedonians were to be free and retain their fields and cities and elect their officials. Then the partition, the borders of the four cantons, and the tribute were announced. Aemilius designated the four capitals. Intermarriage between people of different cantons and the possession of houses or land in more than one canton were banned. Gold and silver mines were not allowed to be mined, but iron and copper ones mining continued. Import of salt and wood cutting for domestic shipbuilding or allowing others to do so were forbidden. The cantons bordering other nations were allowed to have border troops.

The Romans used their victory to increase their control over Greece by supporting pro-Roman factions. Their supporters had come to the conference from all over Greece. They made allegations that many of those who had supported Perseus in their cities and states had fostered hostility towards Rome, claimed that maintaining loyalty to Rome in their states required crushing them, and gave lists of names. The commissioners decided that those on the list had to go to Rome to defend themselves. Livy wrote that the pro-Romans were inflated “to an insupportable pitch of insolence&quot;. In Macedon everyone who had been in the king&#x27;s service was sent to Italy with their children over fifteen.

Aemilius sent Nasica and his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, to ravage the areas of Illyria that had helped Perseus.

== Enslavement of Epirots ==
After the defeat of the Illyrian king, Lucius Anicius, the commander in Illyria placed garrisons in the Illyrian cities. Then he marched on Epirus to suppress the rebellion there. All the cities except Passaron, Tecmon, Phylacem, and Horreum, surrendered. Passaron was the first to be attacked. Its two leaders had incited Epirus to side with Perseus and told the inhabitants that death was preferable to servitude. A young noble stood against them and encouraged the people to drive the two out of the city, which then surrendered. At Tecmon the city leader was killed and the city surrendered. The other two fell after a siege. When Epirus was pacified and detachments wintered in various cities, Lucius Anicius returned to Scodra, the capital of Illyria, where five commissioners had arrived from Rome. There he summoned leaders from around Illyria to a conference. In agreement with the commissioners, he announced that the Roman garrisons were to be withdrawn from Illyrian cities. Some cities had deserted Caravantius and gone over to the Romans. They were exempted from paying a tribute. Rebel cities were also exempted. The three cities that had resisted the longest were to pay half of the tribute they paid to Gentius. Lucius Anicius also declared that Illyria was to be split into three cantons.

Aemilius went to Epirus on his way back to Rome. The senate gave his army permission to plunder the cities in Epirus that had supported Perseus. Centurions were sent to tell the cities that they had come to remove to the Roman garrisons because the Epirots were to be free. The leaders of each city were summoned and told to bring the silver and gold in their towns to a designated place and that Roman cohorts had been ordered to visit all the cities. Troops were sent to seventy cities. This was coordinated so that they would reach each city on the same day. The precious metals were collected and then the soldiers sacked the cities. The city walls were demolished. The booty was enormous and part of the proceeds from its sale was given to the men of the army, 400 denarii to the cavalrymen and 200 to the foot soldiers. In addition to this, 150,000 people were enslaved. The troops resented that they were not given a share of the booty from the royal palace of Perseus “as though they had not taken any part in the Macedonian war&quot;. Aemilius then sailed to Italy with his army. A few days later Lucius Anicius, who had been meeting the representatives of the rest of the Epirots, told them that the senate wanted to hear from some of their leaders and ordered them to follow him to Italy. He then waited for the ships that had transported the army from Macedonia and back to Italy.

<text>The Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC) was fought between Macedon, led by the pretender Andriscus, and the Roman Republic. It was the last of the Macedonian Wars, and was the last war to seriously threaten Roman control of Greece until the First Mithridatic War sixty years later.

The last Macedonian king of the Antigonid dynasty, Perseus, had been defeated and dethroned by the Romans in the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC. In the aftermath of the war, Rome took indirect control of the region through a system of client states, and imposed harsh terms to prevent Macedon from becoming a powerful state again. This system was successful in maintaining Roman hegemony for nearly two decades, but broke down when Andriscus, a Greek who bore a resemblance to Perseus, claimed to be the former king&#x27;s son and re-established the Macedonian Kingdom with Thracian troops.

Andriscus was initially successful, defeating Roman clients and a Roman army sent to stop him, and conquering much of Thessaly. However, he was eventually defeated by another Roman army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus at the Second Battle of Pydna in 148 BC, severely weakening his position; he was subsequently pursued and eventually betrayed to the Romans. After settling a few subsequent minor rebellions, Rome took direct control of Macedon, making it a Roman province.

==Background==
Tensions between the Roman Republic and Macedon had first begun in 215 BC, when Philip V of Macedon allied himself with Rome&#x27;s rival, Carthage, and declared war on Rome, sparking the First Macedonian War, an indecisive sideshow of the larger Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage. Soon after the end of the war with Carthage, a victorious Rome received multiple requests for assistance from a number of Greek polities and city-states which were afraid of Philip&#x27;s ambition. Although war-weary from the recent Punic War, Rome agreed, and when Philip refused to accept their terms, they declared war on and defeated him in the Second Macedonian War of 200-197 BC, in which Philip was stripped of much territory and prestige, and forced to comply with Rome&#x27;s demands. In the aftermath of this conflict, tensions developed between Rome and the Seleucid Empire, whose ambitious monarch, Antiochus III the Great, aimed to attain hegemony over Greece. Encouraged by the Aetolian League, Antiochus went to war with Rome in 192 BC, sparking the Roman-Seleucid War; it ended in a resounding Roman victory — Antiochus lost all his territory in Asia Minor and had to disband his fleet, pay a massive war indemnity and promise not to cross the Taurus mountains, effectively relegating the Seleucids to an Asiatic power and ending their influence in Greece. Macedon regained some territory and influence on account of their cooperation with the Romans in this conflict, but high-handed Roman actions and Macedonian revanchism continued to stoke resentment in Philip.

Macedonian power continued to grow for the rest of Philip&#x27;s reign, and this was continued by his talented son and successor, Perseus. Although Rome formally reaffirmed &quot;friendship&quot; with him, tensions continued to grow on account of reviving Macedonian power, Perseus&#x27; growing popularity with the Greeks and his successful diplomacy in the Greek world, in which he revived Macedonian influence and strengthened its position as a leading power once again. A tenuous peace continued until Eumenes II of Pergamon, a staunch Roman ally and Perseus&#x27; arch-rival, went to Rome in 172 BC and persuaded them that Perseus was a threat to Rome and the Greeks, and exhorted them to break his power. Finally, as Eumenes was returning to Pergamon, an assassination attempt on him, for which Perseus was blamed, resolved Rome in favour of war. The ensuing Third Macedonian War of 171-168 BC was hard-fought, but ended in a complete Roman victory and Perseus&#x27; surrender and imprisonment, establishing Rome&#x27;s position as the sole hegemonic power in the Greek world.

The Greek world was harshly treated in the aftermath of the Roman victory; allies of Perseus were brutally repressed, while those suspected to have sympathized with Perseus became pariahs in the new Roman-dominated order. Rome took unprecedented measures to ensure that a revival of Macedonian power would be impossible — the ancient Macedonian monarchy was abolished and Perseus was exiled to an Italian city. Knowing that occupying Macedon would require military presence against barbarian tribes on Macedon&#x27;s northern frontier, Rome decided against making it a province; instead, Macedon was broken up into four client republics, or &quot;merides&quot;, that paid tribute to Rome, with trade regulations and restrictions on interaction between the republics, as well as being forbidden to work Macedon&#x27;s rich mines freely, and limiting them to possessing only such military forces as were necessary to deal with barbarian tribes to the north. Most of the former ruling elite was deported to Rome. Macedon also suffered from impoverishment, due to the fiscal restrictions imposed on it and the looting of treasuries by victorious Roman troops at the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC. This, along with the effective destruction of the old social order, created great resentment among many sections of the populace.

However, Rome withdrew all its troops in 167 BC; thereafter, it left the Macedonian republics alone in their internal administration, not intervening even when appeals were made to it to resolve serious crises like a massacre of Macedonian officials in 163 BC. It has been suggested that Rome was seeking to satisfy the Macedonians with local autonomy, so that they would forget any sort of &quot;national&quot; identity; however, a general longing for monarchy persisted in Macedon, as the people had not yet adapted to democratic institutions, though a significant class of pro-Roman Macedonian republicans did develop, including those who had been persecuted by the old Antigonid monarchy. Some regulations were relaxed; for instance, the Macedonians were allowed to use their mines again from 158 BC, but resentment continued, including over those restrictions that remained, as well as the division of Macedon, leaving the situation ripe for the rise of pretenders to the old Antigonid throne.

==Andriscus claims the throne==

Around 154/153 BC, a Greek named Andriscus, who bore a resemblance to the Antigonids, began claiming that he was Philip, a now-obscure son of Perseus, and had been reared in secrecy by a foster family. The origins of this youth are unclear; ancient sources generally agree that he was a man of low origins, and that he hailed from Adramyttium in Aeolis in northwestern Asia Minor. He entered Macedonia in force to claim &quot;his&quot; throne, but was repulsed, presumably by the combined forces of three of the four client republics (the third republic had been forbidden from raising troops by the settlement of 167 BC).

At some point after this failure, he travelled to Syria and enlisted as a mercenary of the Seleucid monarch, Demetrius I Soter, and now began making his claims there. News of his claims spread, and after gaining enough notability, he appealed to the Seleucid monarch, Demetrius I Soter, to help him regain his throne. Despite riotous support for him from the population of the Seleucid capital, Antioch, Demetrius refused to help him, and instead arrested him and had him shipped to Rome. The senate, however, remained complacent; although he was brought before the senate, he was simply exiled to an Italian city. He soon managed to escape from Italy and fled back to the Greek world, but the Romans remained unpreturbed; they did not take him seriously.

He travelled to Miletus, where he tried to advance his claims further, attracting significant attention. Diodorus writes that when the leaders of Miletus learned about this, they arrested him and sought advice from visiting Roman envoys on what to do with him; the envoys were contemptuous of the pretender and told the Milesians that he was safe to release. After his release, he continued to try to achieve his aim of becoming king of Macedon. He travelled to Pergamon to meet with Callippa, a former concubine of Perseus, who gave him money and royal regalia. From there he went on to Byzantium, where he was received favourably and obtaining a significant following and a number of sympathizers. Helliesen proposes that the following that Andriscus built up in this period derived from Macedonians who had fled to Attalid territory after the Third Macedonian War and had been settled in garrisons in western Lydia.

Andriscus then travelled to Thrace, where he found allies and sympathy, especially from the Odrysian king Teres III, who was related to the Antigonids by marriage. Teres held a coronation ceremony for Andriscus, crowning him with a diadem, gave him a hundred troops, and introduced him to other Thracian leaders, including one Barsabas, who agreed to accompany him on his campaign to reclaim the Macedonian throne. He was also aided by some forces of Macedonian origin that Rubinsohn refers to as &quot;émigré rabble&quot;.

==Course of the war==
===Andriscus&#x27; conquest of Macedon===
With this force, Andriscus invaded Macedonia in the spring of 149 BC. Initially, he failed to inspire much popular support for himself among the Macedonian populace, emboldening the Roman client republics in Macedon, and making the Roman Senate complacent about the risk posed by the pretender. There are indications that his first attempts to conquer Macedon were failures; he rallied his resources and tried again, meeting the forces of one of the republics in a battle on the banks of the Strymon river, defeating them soundly and conquering all of Macedonia west of the Strymon, including the old royal capital of Pella where took up residence, around the summer of 149 BC. At this point, he assumed the regnal name Philip. The Macedonian republics to the west continued to resist him, but were defeated in another battle on the west bank of the Strymon, after which the Macedonians seem to have accepted him as king.
His victories gained him the loyalty of the Macedonians; the people longed for monarchy and were willing to accept a ruler, and were eager to get rid of the artificial divisions and factional strife of the client republics. On the other hand, the neighbouring Greeks, including the historian Polybius, were taken by surprise; Polybius writes in astonishment of how the pretender who had &quot;dropped from the skies&quot; and, in his view, was a tyrant, could be accepted, let alone enthusiastically, by the Macedonians. Eckstein puts this view down to the fact that Polybius and the Greeks were part of a deep-rooted republican society, and could not comprehend the Macedonian longing for a hallowed monarchical past. Andriscus now attacked Thessaly; the Thessalian League appealed to the Achaean League for aid, knowing that any Roman involvement would be slow to come. They and the remnants of the pro-Roman Macedonian forces resisted him for some time, until Rome finally decided to send a legate, Scipio Nasica Corculum, to assess the situation.

===Roman involvement===
Scipio was sent with the purpose of negotiating a peaceful settlement; Gruen remarks that the fact that Rome believed in the possibility of a peaceful settlement at this stage shows that they were either out of touch with the situation or were not really committed to the settlement they had drawn up in the aftermath of the Third Macedonian War. It has been suggested that there is a possibility that he was sent before news of Andriscus&#x27; campaigns became widely known, and that he was simply sent to dissuade any Greek sympathy for Carthage, which Rome was planning to attack. Whatever the case, Scipio&#x27;s attempts at diplomacy failed, probably because the Romans were unwilling to accept Andriscus&#x27; demand to be recognized as king of a unified Macedon. Instead, Scipio resorted to military action, and began to rally the forces of Thessalians and Achaeans that had already been fighting. With them, he managed to temporarily halt Andriscus&#x27; advance. Still, the Roman commander informed the Senate that direct military intervention would be needed to stop the pretender, as the situation was getting dire, with Andriscus already having conquered significant parts of Thessaly.

===Thalna&#x27;s defeat===
In response to Scipio&#x27;s report, the Senate appointed a praetor, Publius Juventius Thalna, to command a legion and settle the situation with military force. Thalna was probably reinforced by Greek contingents, and spent two or three months stabilizing the situation. However he seems to have underestimated Andriscus, not understanding that Andriscus&#x27; army had swelled dramatically since his enthronement, including contingents of both Macedonians and Thracians. Thalna&#x27;s attempt to invade Macedonia via Thessaly was intercepted by Andriscus at an unspecified location near the borders of Macedon in late 149 or early 148 BC; details of the engagement are scarce, but Thalna was killed and his army almost annihilated, with the survivors escaping under the cover of night. It was the worst defeat Rome had suffered so far in their campaigns against Hellenistic powers, and had massive psychological impact in both Greece and Rome.

Domestically, Andriscus&#x27; popularity was greatly increased, and he launched another invasion of Thessaly, successfully devastating and conquering most of it. Foreign interest in him increased; Carthage, which was now at war with Rome in the Third Punic War, agreed to an alliance with him and promised him money and ships. On the other hand, Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamon remained a staunch Roman ally; he had no intention of seeing a strong and revived Macedonia as a neighbour. The battle also underlined the fact that the Macedonians were committed to their newly-revived monarchy, however weak their king&#x27;s claim.

At the same time, the Macedonian victory also meant the end of any hopes of negotiated peace with Rome. The Romans could not take such a defeat lying down, and resolved to crush Macedonia as a power once and for all. Fears of Roman reprisal prompted defections in Macedon; Andriscus began to take harsh and cruel measures against any pro-Roman elements, conducting acts of terrorism and repression against them.

===Metellus&#x27; campaign===
Rome soon began preparing a full consular army of two legions to fight in Macedon; despite the difficulties associated with raising such a force when they already had many legions serving in other theatres of war, the Senate did not wish to take any risks in the aftermath of Thalna&#x27;s crushing defeat, and strongly desired to avoid any possibility of military collaboration between Macedon and Carthage. Both Roman consuls for the year were already engaged in other theatres of war; therefore, the Senate entrusted the campaign one of the year&#x27;s praetors, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, granting him proconsular powers.

Arriving in Greece in the summer of 148 BC, Metellus received the assistance of the fleet of Attalus II, and made an advance along the Thessalian coast, while the Pergamene fleet threatened the coastal districts of northern Macedonia; Amphipolis seems to have passed out of Andriscus&#x27; control by this stage. To protect himself from both offensives, and to prevent the loss of Macedon&#x27;s seaboard, the king took up a defensive position at Pydna, where the Roman commander engaged him in battle.

====Second Battle of Pydna====
Not many details survive about the battle, or the exact numbers of troops involved. The first clash was a cavalry skirmish, in which Andriscus&#x27; forces had the upper hand, defeating units of Roman cavalry. Before or around the time of this skirmish, a Macedonian cavalry commander named Telestes defected with a significant portion of the Macedonian cavalry.

After this, Andriscus sent away some of his forces to continue his campaign in Thessaly, possibly due to supply issues or to threaten the Roman rear, or due to overconfidence. Metellus seized this opportunity to attack in full strength, possibly with the assistance of traitors in Andriscus&#x27; force; his forces soon routed both forces of Macedonians; Andriscus fled the battle.

==End of the war==
The battle shattered Andriscus&#x27; army and broke the Macedonian war effort. He fled to Thrace and began raising another army there, but Metellus pursued him swiftly, forcing Andriscus into a new battle before his raw levies were fully prepared. This engagement was an easy victory for the Romans; as soon as the Macedonian front ranks were broken, the rest of the army fled in panic. Andriscus himself fled to the Thracian princeling Byzes, but Metellus managed to persuade the latter to become a Roman ally and hand Andriscus over, concluding the campaign.

However, Macedon was not fully pacified yet. Another uprising, probably with Thracian support, arose under the leadership of a certain Alexander, who now declared himself to be a son of Perseus and occupied the basin of the Nestus River. However, he was quickly defeated by Metellus and forced to flee into Dardania. By the end of 147 BC, Metellus had largely pacified the country and restored order. This was not the end of Macedonian rebellions against Rome; another pretender would later cause a crisis in 142 BC, raising an army of 16,000 men before being defeated and killed by the quaestor Lucius Tremellius; apart from this, border crises with the Thracians, which had been an issue for previous Macedonian governments as well, continued.

Metellus imposed penalties on the Macedonians, as well as on the Byzantines, who had earlier been sympathetic to Andriscus. He took significant booty, including some of the spoils taken by Alexander the Great at the Battle of the Granicus, and many valuable works of art. After settling subsequent affairs in Greece and Macedon, the victorious praetor later returned to Rome in 146 BC, where he was given the agnomen &quot;Macedonicus&quot; and granted a triumph. Andriscus was paraded in this triumph, and subsequently executed.

==Roman reorganization of Macedon==
The Senate realized that the settlement of 168 BC could no longer sustain itself; the extent of support that Andriscus&#x27; uprising had won among the Macedonians demonstrated both the fragility of indirect control and the need for a thorough reorganization of Macedonia. It is likely that a senatorial legation was sent to Macedon, probably soon after Metellus&#x27; victory, and, together with Metellus, made administrative changes to governance in Macedon, transferring significant functions to a Roman praetor. From this point onwards, a legion and a praetor were permanently stationed in Macedon; this was the first time Roman troops were permanently based east of the Adriatic Sea. Macedon was unified into a single administrative unit as the Provincia Macedonia; the new province included not only Macedon, but also parts of southern Illyria, as well as Epirus and Thessaly. This received mixed reactions; on one hand, the people welcomed the reunification of Macedon; on the other hand, they resented their loss of freedom and the harsher rule of the Romans. Many praetors would engage in corruption and extortion; besides, they were not as effective as previous administrations in protecting the region from barbarian raids.

The exact nature and chronology of the provincialization is a matter of debate. It is known that a new provincial era, the &quot;Macedonian Era&quot;, was proclaimed in 148 BC, but it is disputed as to whether this was to signify the formation of the province or Metellus&#x27; victory. Doubts have been expressed as to whether Metellus could have had the time to organize Macedonia into a province, and it has instead been suggested that it was one of the consuls of 146 BC, Lucius Mummius, who reorganized Macedon with the help of a decemviral commission while settling the affairs of Greece. Gruen and Eckstein doubt whether Macedon ever formally became a province, pointing out that the Macedonian &quot;merides&quot; continued to exist well into the early principate. In their view, what changed after the Fourth Macedonian war was the fact that from then on, a Roman praetor and his legion were permanently stationed in Macedonia; naturally, they gradually took on more administrative and bureaucratic roles, leading to an informal provincialization. Still, the presence of Roman officials after 148 BC was a sudden and clear change, and signified the loss of Macedonian and Illyrian freedom.

==Aftermath==

Soon afterwards, the Achaean League in 146 BC mobilized for a new war against the Roman Republic. This is known as the Achaean War, and was noted for its short duration and its timing right after the fall of Macedonia. Until this time, Rome had only campaigned in Greece in order to fight Macedonian forces, allies or clients. The Achaean leaders almost certainly knew that this declaration of war against Rome was hopeless, as Rome had triumphed against far stronger and larger opponents, the Roman legion having proved its supremacy over the Macedonian phalanx.

Polybius blames the demagogues of the cities of the league for inspiring the population into a suicidal war. Panhellenic rhetoric and the idea of triumphing against superior odds motivated the league into this rash decision. The Achaean League was swiftly defeated, and, as an object lesson, Rome utterly destroyed the city of Corinth in 146 BC, the same year that Carthage was destroyed. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in the Greek world, which always led back to internal instability and war when Rome pulled out, the Senate decided to establish the Roman province of Macedonia, covering all of mainland Greece and establishing a permanent Roman presence in the region, though a few territories like Athens and Sparta retained self-government and partial autonomy. More than a century later, Augustus would establish Achaea as a separate province.

<text>The Guardian Council (also called Council of Guardians or Constitutional Council, ) is an appointed and constitutionally mandated 12-member council that wields considerable power and influence in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The constitution of the Islamic Republic gives the council three mandates: 
:a) veto power over legislation passed by the parliament (Majlis); 
:b) supervision of elections; and 
:c) approving or disqualifying candidates seeking to run in local, parliamentary, presidential, or Assembly of Experts elections.
The Iranian constitution calls for the council to be composed of six Islamic faqihs (experts in Islamic Law), &quot;conscious of the present needs and the issues of the day&quot; to be selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran, and six jurists, &quot;specializing in different areas of law, to be elected by the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament) from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Chief Justice&quot; (who, in turn, is also appointed by the Supreme Leader).

The Council has played a central role in controlling the interpretation of Islamic values in Iranian law in the following ways: 
*As part of its vetting of potential candidates to determine who can and cannot run for national office, it has disqualified reform-minded candidates—including the most well-known candidates—from running for office;
*Vetoes laws passed by the popularly elected Majlis.
*Has increased the influence that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (an ideological fighting force separate from the Iranian army) has on the economic and cultural life of the country.

When the 2009 presidential election was announced, popular former president Mohammad Khatami would not discuss his plans to run against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for the Council might have disqualified Khatami as it had other reformists&#x27; candidatures, on the grounds that they were not dedicated enough to Islamic values.

There have also been instances where the Constitutional Council reversed its ban on particular people after being ordered to do so by Khamenei.

The lack of transparency in the rendering of decisions by the Guardian Council has eroded its legitimacy in the eyes of Iranians and the world.

==Legislative functions==
The Majlis has no legal status without the Constitutional Council. Any bill passed by the Majlis must be reviewed and approved by the Constitutional Council to become law.

According to Article 96 of the constitution, the Constitutional Council holds absolute veto power over all legislation approved by the Majlis. It can nullify a law based on two accounts: being against Islamic laws, or being against the constitution. While all the members vote on the laws being compatible with the constitution, only the six clerics vote on them being compatible with Islam.

If any law is rejected, it will be passed back to the Majlis for correction. If the Majlis and the Council of Guardians cannot agree on a case, it is passed up to the Expediency Council for a decision.

The Constitutional Council is uniquely involved in the legislative process, with equal oversight with regards to economic law and social policy, including such controversial topics as abortion. Chapter 6 of the Constitution explains its interworkings with the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Articles 91-97 all fall into the legislative Chapter 6.

==Judicial authority==
The Council of Guardians also functions similar to a constitutional court. The authority to interpret the constitution is vested in the Council. Interpretative decisions require a three-quarters majority. The Council does not conduct a court hearing where opposing sides are argued.

==Electoral authority==
Since 1991, all candidates of parliamentary or presidential elections, as well as candidates for the Assembly of Experts, have to be qualified by the Constitutional Council in order to run in the election. For major elections, it typically disqualifies most candidates, as seen in the 2009 election, where out of the 476 men and women applied to the Constitutional Council to seek the presidency, only four were approved.

The Council is accorded &quot;supervision of elections&quot;. The Constitutional Council interprets the term &quot;supervision&quot; in Article 99 of the Iranian Constitution as &quot;approbation supervision&quot; (, &quot;naẓārat-e istiṣwābī&quot;) which implies the right to accept or reject the legality of elections and the competency of candidates. This interpretation is in contrast with the idea of &quot;notification supervision&quot; (, &quot;naẓārat-e istitlā‘ī&quot;) which does not imply the mentioned approval right. The &quot;evidentiary supervision&quot; (, &quot;naẓārat-e istinādī&quot;), which requires evidences for acceptance or rejection of elections legality and candidates competency, is another interpretation of mentioned article.

===Role in the 2009 elections===

On June 29, 2009, the Constitutional Council certified the results of the controversial election in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected. The Council had completed a recount of 10 percent of the overall votes in order to appease the citizens of Iran. As the &quot;final authority on the election&quot;, the Council has declared the election closed. The certification of the results set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government&#x27;s ban on street marches.

== Criticism ==
=== Increases the role of the IRGC in everyday politics ===
The Council favors military candidates at the expense of reform candidates. This ensures that the ideological Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (separate from the Iranian army) holds a commanding influence over the political, economic, and cultural life of Iran.

=== Arbitrary disqualifications of candidates from elections ===
Hadi Khamenei, the brother of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and an adviser in the administration of reformist former President Mohammad Khatami, has said the Constitutional Council&#x27;s vetting of candidates threatens Iranian democracy. He believes some reformist candidates are wrongly kept from running. In 1998, the Constitutional Council rejected his candidacy for a seat in the Assembly of Experts for &quot;insufficient theological qualifications&quot;.

After conservative candidates fared poorly in the 2000 parliamentary elections, the Council disqualified more than 3,600 reformist and independent candidates for the 2004 elections.

In the run-up to the 2006 Iranian Assembly of Experts election, all female candidates were disqualified.

The Council disqualified many candidates in the 2008 parliamentary elections. One third of them were members of the outgoing parliament it had previously approved. The Iranian Ministry of the Interior reasons for disqualification included narcotics addiction or involvement in drug-smuggling, connections to the Shah&#x27;s pre-revolutionary government, lack of belief in or insufficient practice of Islam, being &quot;against&quot; the Islamic Republic, or having connections to foreign intelligence services.

=== Rule by unelected leaders ===
This unelected Council frequently vetoes bills passed by the popularly elected legislature. It repeatedly vetoes bills that are in favour of women’s rights, electoral reform, the prohibition of torture and ratification of international human rights treaties.

=== Rigging results after elections in favor of conservatives ===
The Guardian Council has been criticized for ousting pro-Reform candidates who had won their elections, without providing legal justification or factual evidence. Examples of such interventions by the Guardian Council are: 
* Annulment of the results in Khoy and Eslamabad-e Gharb (2000).
* Rahman Kargosha (2000, Arak), certain ballots were voided in order to declare the conservative incumbent as the winner.
* Alireza Rajaei (2000, Tehran), certain ballots were voided in order to declare the conservative incumbent as the winner.
* Minoo Khaleghi (2016, Isfahan), disqualified after winning the election.
* Khaled Zamzamnejad (2016, Bandar Lengeh), election annulled.
* Beytollah Abdollahi (2016, Ahar and Heris), election annulled.

==Composition==
The Council is composed of Islamic clerics and lawyers. Membership is for phased six-year terms: half the membership changes every three years.

The Supreme Leader (Iran&#x27;s Head of State) directly appoints the six clerics, and may dismiss them at will. The head of the judicial system of Iran nominates six lawyers for confirmation by the Majlis.

On March 13, 2021, the Iranian Constitutional Council officially launched its English service. The English website was inaugurated during the regular monthly press briefing of the spokesman of the Constitutional Council, Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei, in Tehran. The website, https://www.shora-gc.ir/en, has five main sections: News, Multimedia, Members, Legislation, and the Constitution.

<text>Richard Allestree or Allestry ( ; 1621/22 – 28 January 1681) was an English Royalist churchman and provost of Eton College from 1665.

==Life==
The son of Robert Allestree, descended from an old Derbyshire family, he was born at Uppington in Shropshire. Although John Fell gave his birth date as March 1619, this conflicts with his college records. He was educated at the Free School, Coventry, and entered Christ Church, Oxford, under Richard Busby. He entered as a commoner in 1636, matriculating as a student on 17 February 1637 aged fifteen, and took the degree of B.A. in 1640 and that of M.A. in 1643.

In 1642 he joined the king&#x27;s army, under Sir John Byron. When the parliamentary forces arrived in Oxford, he hid the Christ Church valuables, and the soldiers found nothing in the treasury &quot;except a single groat and a halter at the bottom of a large iron chest&quot;. Allestree escaped severe punishment only because the army hastily retreated from the town. He was present at the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642, after which, while hurrying to Oxford to prepare for the king&#x27;s visit to Christ Church, he was captured by a troop of Lord Say&#x27;s soldiers from Broughton House, Cambridge, and soon afterwards set free on the surrender of the place to the king&#x27;s forces. In 1643 he was again on military service, performing &quot;all duties of a common soldier&quot; and &quot;frequently holding his musket in one hand and his book in the other&quot;. At the close of the English Civil War, he returned to his studies, took holy orders, was made Censor and became a &quot;noted tutor&quot;.

He remained an ardent royalist. He voted for the university decree against the Covenant, and, refusing submission to the parliamentary visitors in 1648, he was expelled. He found a retreat as chaplain in the house of Francis Newport, later Viscount Newport, in whose service he travelled to France. On his return he joined two of his friends, John Dolben and John Fell, afterwards respectively Archbishop of York and Bishop of Oxford, and later joined the household of Sir Antony Cope of Hanwell, near Banbury. He was now frequently employed in carrying despatches between the future Charles II of England and royalist sympathisers. In May 1659 he brought a command from Charles in Brussels, directing Brian Duppa, the Bishop of Salisbury, to summon all bishops to consecrate clergymen to various sees &quot;to secure a continuation of the order in the Church of England&quot;, then in danger of becoming extinct.

While returning from one of these missions, in the winter before the Restoration, he was arrested at Dover and committed a prisoner at Lambeth Palace, then used as a jail for royalists, but was freed after a few weeks at the instance, among others, of Lord Shaftesbury. At the Restoration he became canon of Christ Church, D.D. and city lecturer at Oxford. In 1663 he was made chaplain to the king and Regius Professor of Divinity. He was an Arminian discussion partner of the Calvinist Thomas Barlow while at Oxford. In 1665 he was appointed provost of Eton College, and proved himself a capable administrator. He introduced order into the disorganised finances of the college and procured the confirmation of William Laud&#x27;s decree which reserved five of the Eton fellowships for members of King&#x27;s College. His additions to the college buildings were less successful: the Upper School constructed by him at his own expense, was falling into ruin almost in his lifetime, and was replaced by the present structure in 1689. 

Allestree was buried in the chapel at Eton College, where there is a Latin inscription to his memory.

Allestree bequeathed his library of circa 3500 books to Christ Church, Oxford, where he also served as treasurer, helping the college to recover in the years after the civil war.

==Works==

His writings are:
*&quot;The Privileges of the University of Oxford in point of Visitation&quot; (1647) – a tract answered by Prynne in the &quot;University of Oxford&#x27;s Plea Rejected&quot;.
*&quot;The Gentlemans Calling&quot; (1660).
*Various sermons published separately, including &quot;A Sermon on Acts xiii. 2&quot; (1660).
*&quot;The Government of the Tongue&quot; (1667; 1674).
*&quot;18 Sermons whereof 15 Preached before the King&quot; [...] (1669).
*&quot;The Ladies Calling. In Two Parts.&quot; (1673).
*&quot;A Paraphrase and Annotations upon All the Epistles of St Paul&quot; (joint author with Abraham Woodhead and Obadiah Walker, 1675, see edition of 1853 and preface by W Jacobson).
*&quot;40 Sermons whereof 21 are Now First Published&quot; [...] (2 vols., 1684).

In the &quot;Cases of Conscience&quot; by Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln (1692), Allestree&#x27;s judgment on Mr Cottington&#x27;s Case of Divorce is included. A share in the composition, if not the sole authorship, of the books published under the name of the author of &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot; has been attributed to Allestree (Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes&quot;, ii. 603), and the tendency of modern criticism is to regard him as the author. His lectures, with which he was dissatisfied, were not published.

Allestree was a man of extensive learning, of moderate views and a fine preacher. He was generous and charitable, of &quot;a solid and masculine kindness,&quot; and of a temper hot, but completely under control.

<text>Systole ( ) is the part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart contract after refilling with blood. Its contrasting phase is diastole, the relaxed phase of the cardiac cycle when the chambers of the heart are refilling with blood.

==Etymology==
The term originates, via Neo-Latin, from Ancient Greek (&quot;sustolē&quot;), from (&quot;sustéllein&quot; &#x27;to contract&#x27;; from &quot;sun&quot; &#x27;together&#x27; + &quot;stéllein&quot; &#x27;to send&#x27;), and is similar to the use of the English term &quot;to squeeze&quot;.

==Terminology, general explanation==
The mammalian heart has four chambers: the left atrium above the left ventricle (lighter pink, see graphic), which two are connected through the mitral (or bicuspid) valve; and the right atrium above the right ventricle (lighter blue), connected through the tricuspid valve. The atria are the receiving blood chambers for the circulation of blood and the ventricles are the discharging chambers.

In late ventricular diastole, the atrial chambers contract and send blood to the ventricles. This flow fills the ventricles with blood, and the resulting pressure closes the valves to the atria. The ventricles now perform isovolumetric contraction, which is contraction while all valves are closed. This contraction ends the first stage of systole. The second stage proceeds immediately, pumping oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve and aorta to all body systems, and simultaneously pumping oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery to the lungs. Thus, the pairs of chambers (upper atria and lower ventricles) contract in alternating sequence to each other. First, atrial contraction feeds blood into the ventricles, then ventricular contraction pumps blood out of the heart to the body systems, including the lungs for resupply of oxygen.

Cardiac systole is the contraction of the cardiac muscle in response to an electrochemical stimulus to the heart&#x27;s cells (cardiomyocytes).

Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the ventricles in one minute. The ejection fraction is the volume of blood pumped divided by the total volume of blood in the left ventricle.

==Types of systole==

===Atrial systole===
Atrial systole occurs late in ventricular diastole and represents the contraction of myocardium of the left and right atria. The sharp decrease in ventricular pressure that occurs during ventricular diastole allows the atrioventricular valves (or mitral and tricuspid valves) to open and causes the contents of the atria to empty into the ventricles. The atrioventricular valves remain open while the aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed because the pressure gradient between the atrium and ventricle is preserved during late ventricular diastole. Atrial contraction confers a minor-fraction addition to ventricular filling, but becomes significant in left ventricular hypertrophy, or thickening of the heart wall, as the ventricle does not fully relax during its diastole. Loss of normal electrical conduction in the heart—as seen during atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and complete heart block—may eliminate atrial systole completely.

Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As both atrial chambers contract—from the superior region of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum—pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular valves. At the start of atrial systole, during ventricular diastole, the ventricles are normally filled to about 70–80 percent of capacity by inflow from the atria. Atrial contraction also referred to as the &quot;atrial kick,&quot; contributes the remaining 20–30 percent of ventricular filling. Atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.

The two ventricles are isolated electrically and histologically (tissue-wise) from the two atrial chambers by electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton. The cardiac skeleton is made of dense connective tissue which gives structure to the heart by forming the atrioventricular septum—which separates the atria from the ventricles—and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. Collagen extensions from the valve rings seal and limit electrical activity of the atria from influencing electrical pathways that cross the ventricles. These electrical pathways contain the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and the Purkinje fibers. (Exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare.)

Cardiac rate control via pharmacology is common today; for example, the therapeutic use of digoxin, beta adrenoceptor antagonists, or calcium channel blockers are important historical interventions in this condition. Notably, individuals prone to hypercoagulability (abnormality of blood coagulation) are at decided risk of blood clotting, a very serious pathology requiring therapy for life with an anticoagulant if it cannot be corrected.

====Right and left atrial systoles====
The atrial chambers each contains one valve: the tricuspid valve in the right atrium opens into the right ventricle, and the mitral (or bicuspid) valve in the left atrium opens into the left ventricle. Both valves are pressed open during the late stages of ventricular diastole; see Wiggers diagram at the P/QRS phase (at right margin). Then the contractions of atrial systole cause the right ventricle to fill with oxygen-depleted blood through the tricuspid valve. When the right atrium is emptied—or prematurely closed—right atrial systole ends, and this stage signals the end of &quot;ventricular diastole&quot; and the beginning of &quot;ventricular systole&quot; (see Wiggers diagram). The time variable for the right systolic cycle is measured from (tricuspid) valve-open to valve-closed.

The contractions of atrial systole fill the left ventricle with oxygen-enriched blood through the mitral valve; when the left atrium is emptied or closed, left atrial systole is ended and ventricular systole is about to begin. The time variable for the left systolic cycle is measured from (mitral) valve-open to valve-closed.

====Atrial fibrillation====

Atrial fibrillation represents a common electrical malady in the heart that appears during the time interval of atrial systole (see figure at right margin). Theory suggests that an ectopic focus, usually situated within the pulmonary trunks, competes with the sinoatrial node for electrical control of the atrial chambers and thereby diminishes the performance of the atrial myocardium, or atrial heart muscle. The ordered, sinoatrial control of atrial electrical activity is disrupted, causing the loss of coordinated generation of pressure in the two atrial chambers. Atrial fibrillation represents an electrically disordered but well perfused atrial mass working (in an uncoordinated fashion) with a (comparatively) electrically healthy ventricular systole.

The compromised load caused by atrial fibrillation detracts from the overall performance of the heart, but the ventricles continue to work as an effective pump. Given this pathology, the ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent. Uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute (bpm). If this rate can be slowed to a normal range, say about 80 bpm, the resultant longer fill-time within the cardiac cycle restores or improves the pumping capability of the heart. The labored breathing, for example, of individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, can often be returned to normal by (electrical or medical) cardioversion.

===Ventricular systole and Wiggers diagram===

A Wiggers diagram of ventricular systole graphically depicts the sequence of contractions by the myocardium of the two ventricles. Ventricular systole induces self-contraction such that pressure in both left and right ventricles rises to a level above that in the two atrial chambers, thereby closing the tricuspid and mitral valves—which are prevented from inverting by the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. Now ventricular pressure continues to rise in isovolumetric, or fixed-volume, contraction phase until maximal pressure (dP/dt = 0) occurs, causing the pulmonary and aortic valves to open in ejection phase. In ejection phase, blood flows from the two ventricles down its pressure gradient—that is, &#x27;down&#x27; from higher pressure to lower pressure—into (and through) the aorta and the pulmonary trunk respectively. Notably, cardiac muscle perfusion through the heart&#x27;s coronary vessels does not happen during ventricular systole; rather, it occurs during ventricular diastole.

Ventricular systole is the origin of the pulse.

====Right and left ventricular systoles====
The pulmonary (or pulmonic) valve in the right ventricle opens into the pulmonary trunk, also known as the pulmonary artery, which divides twice to connect to each of the left and right lungs. In the left ventricle, the aortic valve opens into the aorta which divides and re-divides into the several branch arteries that connect to all body organs and systems except the lungs.

By its contractions, right ventricular (RV) systole pulses oxygen-depleted blood through the pulmonary valve through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, providing pulmonary circulation; simultaneously, left ventricular (LV) systole pumps blood through the aortic valve, the aorta, and all the arteries to provide systemic circulation of oxygenated blood to all body systems. The left ventricular systole enables blood pressure to be routinely measured in the larger arteries of the left ventricle of the heart.

LV systole is volumetrically defined as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Similarly, RV systole is defined as the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). Higher than normal RVEF is indicative of pulmonary hypertension. The time variables of the ventricular systoles are: right ventricle, pulmonary valve-open to valve-closed; left ventricle, aortic valve-open to valve-closed.

===Electrical systole===

The sinoatrial node (S-A Node) is the heart&#x27;s natural pacemaker, issuing electrical signaling that travels through the heart muscle, causing it to contract repeatedly in cycle. It is situated at the top of the right atrium adjacent to the junction with the superior vena cava. The S-A Node is a pale yellow structure. For humans, it is approximately 25 mm long, 3–4 mm wide and 2 mm thick. It contains two types of cells: (a) the small, round P &quot;cells&quot; which have very few &quot;organelles and myofibrils,&quot; and (b&quot;)&quot; the slender elongated &quot;transitional cells&quot;, which are intermediate in appearance between the P and the ordinary myocardial cells. Intact, the SA node provides continual electrical discharge known as sinus rhythm through the atrial mass, the signals of which then coalesce at the atrioventricular node, there to be organized to provide a rhythmic electrical pulse into and across the ventricles through sodium-, potassium- or calcium-gated ion channels.

The continual rhythmic discharge generates a wavelike movement of electrical ripples that stimulate the smooth muscles of the myocardium and cause rhythmic contractions to progress from top to bottom of the heart. As the pulse moves out of the (upper) atria into the (lower) ventricles, it is distributed throughout a muscular network to cause systolic contraction of both ventricular chambers simultaneously. The actual pace of the cycle—just how fast or slowly the heart beats—is cued by messages from the brain, reflecting the brain&#x27;s responses to conditions of the body, such as pain, emotional stress, level of activity, and to ambient conditions including external temperature, time of day, etc.

===Mechanical systole===
Electrical systole opens voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels in cells of myocardium tissue. Subsequently, a rise in intracellular calcium triggers the interaction of actin and myosin in the presence of ATP which generates mechanical force in the cells in the form of muscular contraction, or mechanical systole. The contractions generate intra-ventricular pressure, which is increased until it exceeds the external, residual pressures in the adjacent trunks of both the pulmonary artery and the aorta; this stage, in turn, causes the pulmonary and aortic valves to open. Blood is then ejected from the two ventricles, pulsing into both the pulmonic and aortic circulation systems.

Mechanical systole causes the pulse, which itself is readily palpated (felt) or seen at several points on the body, enabling universally adopted methods—by touch or by eye—for observing systolic blood pressure.
The mechanical forces of systole cause rotation of the muscle mass around the long and short axes, a process that can be observed as a &quot;wringing&quot; of the ventricles.

==Physiological mechanism==
Systole of the heart is initiated by electrically excitable cells situated in the sinoatrial node. These cells are activated spontaneously by depolarization of the electrical potential across their cell membranes, which causes voltage-gated calcium channels on the cell membrane to open and allow calcium ions to pass through into the sarcoplasm (cytoplasm) of cardiac muscle cells. Calcium ions bind to molecular receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see graphic), which causes a flux (flow) of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm.

Calcium ions bind to troponin C, causing a conformational (i.e., structural) change in the troponin-tropomyosin protein complex, causing the myosin head (binding) sites on F-actin filamentous proteins to be exposed, which causes muscle contraction to occur.
The cardiac action potential spreads distally (or outwardly) to the small branches of the Purkinje tree via the flux of cations through gap junctions that connect the sarcoplasms of adjacent myocytes.

The electrical activity of ventricular systole is coordinated by the atrioventricular node, which is a discrete collection of cells that receives electrical stimulation from the left and right atria and can provide an intrinsic (albeit slower) heart pacemaker activity. The cardiac action potential is propagated down electrical pathways through the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibres; this electrical flux causes coordinated depolarisation and excitation-contraction coupling from the apex of the heart up to the roots of the great vessels.

== Clinical notation ==
When blood pressure is stated for medical purposes, it is usually written with the systolic and diastolic pressures separated by a slash, for example, 120/80 mmHg. This clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio, nor a display of a numerator over a denominator. Rather, it is a medical notation showing the two clinically significant pressures involved (systole followed by diastole). It is often shown followed by a third number, the value of the heart rate (in beats per minute), which typically is measured jointly with blood pressure readings.

<doc id="242361" wikidata="Q4657479" url="?curid=242361" title="A Jackknife to a Swan">
<text>A Jackknife to a Swan is the seventh studio album by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. It was released on July 9, 2002, by SideOneDummy Records. It was recorded over a few weeks in February 2002. This album marked the band&#x27;s return to an indie label, and was the last album released by the group before their four-year hiatus between 2003 and 2007.

The album title is a reference to both the elegant Olympic high dive and the death of something beautiful. Dicky Barrett has said in interviews that the title of the album upset his mother greatly, as her maiden name was Swan, as well as her mother&#x27;s.

An earlier version of &quot;The Old School Off The Bright&quot; was originally featured on a promotional EP titled &quot;Fabled Barney and The Population&quot; given out at the band&#x27;s Hometown Throwdown in 2002. The promotional version of the album features an alternate version of the song &quot;Seven Ways to Sunday&quot;. &quot;Sugar Free&quot; was later featured in the 2006 movie &quot;Beerfest&quot;.

The track &quot;I want My City Back&quot; is a lament about the loss of The Rathskeller, commonly called &quot;The Rat&quot;, the club in Boston where the Bosstones got their start.

==Release==
On March 3, 2002, &quot;A Jackknife to a Swan&quot; was announced for release in July; it was revealed that the band had signed to SideOneDummy Records. On April 20, 2002, &quot;Mr. Moran&quot; and &quot;Sugar Free&quot; were posted on the label&#x27;s website. In May and June, the band toured Europe as part of the Deconstruction Tour. &quot;A Jackknife to a Swan&quot; was made available for streaming the label&#x27;s website on June 25, 2002, before it was released on July 9, 2002. To promote its release, the band appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;Mohr Sports&quot;. On September 26, 2002, a music video for &quot;You Gotta Go!&quot; was posted online. In November and December 2002, the group went on a headlining US tour, with support from Bigwig, Slick Shoes and Simple Plan. On May 21, 2003, the band appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The following month, they embarked on a brief east coast tour with Voodoo Glow Skulls, the Pietasters, and Catch 22. On June 6, the band appeared on &quot;54321&quot;. In October, the band went on a short tour of Germany. In December, the band announced they were going on hiatus.

The album reached #131 on the Billboard 200, and #9 on the Top Independent Albums.

<text>The Duke of Parma and Piacenza () was the ruler of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, a historical state of Northern Italy. It was created by Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese) for his son Pier Luigi Farnese. It existed between 1545 and 1802, and again from 1814 to 1859.

The Duke of Parma was also Duke of Piacenza, except for the first years of the rule of Ottavio Farnese (1549–1556), and the time of the Napoleonic wars, when the two were established as separate positions held by two different individuals. The Duke of Parma also usually held the title of Duke of Guastalla from 1746 (when Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor occupied the Duchy of Guastalla after the last Gonzaga duke died childless) until 1847 (when the territory was ceded to Modena), except for the Napoleonic era, when Napoleon&#x27;s sister Pauline was briefly Duchess of Guastalla and of Varella. The last duke, Robert I, was driven from power in a revolution following France and Sardinia&#x27;s victory over Austria. Its territory was merged into Sardinia in 1860.

The position is currently claimed by a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma. A recent pretender to the extinct Parmese throne, the late Carlos-Hugo, was also a pretender to the Spanish throne in the 1970s (see Carlism).

<doc id="242367" wikidata="Q6250441" url="?curid=242367" title="John Nichols (printer)">
<text>John Nichols (2 February 1745 – 26 November 1826) was an English printer, author and antiquary. He is remembered as an influential editor of the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for nearly 40 years; author of a monumental county history of Leicestershire; author of two compendia of biographical material relating to his literary contemporaries; and as one of the agents behind the first complete publication of Domesday Book in 1783.

==Early life and apprenticeship==
He was born in Islington, London, to Edward Nichols and Anne Wilmot. On 22 June 1766 he married Anne, daughter of William Cradock. Anne bore him three children: Anne (1767), Sarah (1769), and William Bowyer (born 1775 and died a year later). His wife Anne also died in 1776. Nichols was married a second time in 1778, to Martha Green, who bore him eight children. Nichols was taken for training by &quot;the learned printer&quot;, William Bowyer the Younger in early 1757. Nichols was formally apprenticed in February 1759 by Bowyer, whom he eventually succeeded. On the death of his friend and master in 1777 he published a brief memoir, which afterwards grew into the &quot;Anecdotes of William Bowyer and his Literary Friends&quot; (1782).

==Literary career==
In 1788, he became editor of the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and remained so until his death. In that periodical, and in his numerous volumes of &quot;Anecdotes&quot; and &quot;Illustrations&quot;, he made numerous contributions to literary biography. As his materials accumulated he compiled a sort of anecdotal literary history of the century, based on a large collection of letters. &quot;The Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century&quot; (1812–15, nine volumes), into which the original work was expanded, formed only a small part of Nichols&#x27;s production.

Considered one of his most important works, Nichols&#x27;s monumental &quot;History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester&quot;, was the most ambitious of the antiquarian county histories (extremely long, but the quality of the content is very variable), a massive compendium of historical notes, manuscripts and engraved plates printed by subscription after an exhaustive survey of the county, and published in eight parts not in chronological order to make up four volumes when complete, from 1795 to 1815. It was followed by the &quot;Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, consisting of Authentic Memoirs and Original Letters of Eminent Persons&quot;, which was begun in 1817 and completed by his son John Bowyer Nichols (1779–1863) in 1858. The &quot;Anecdotes&quot; and the &quot;Illustrations&quot; are mines of valuable information on the authors, printers and booksellers of the time.

==Nichols and the printing of Domesday Book (1767–83)==
Nichols co-operated with Abraham Farley in the production of the 1783 edition of Domesday Book, which he called in his &quot;Literary Anecdotes&quot; &quot;the most invaluable as well as most antient Record in this or any other kingdom&quot;. Between Farley&#x27;s appointment as co-editor of the project in 1770 and the final publication of Domesday Book in two volumes in 1783, Nichols assisted Farley in printing and proof-reading the text, and also designed the special &quot;record type&quot; typeface that was to be used. This was a source of lasting pride to him; he would later say &quot;on the correctness and the beauty of this important Work I am content to stake my typographical credit&quot;.

The types created by Nichols for the Domesday project were destroyed, alongside much else of value, in a fire at his office in February 1808.

Nichols was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, a trustee of many City of London institutions, and in 1804 he was master of the Stationers&#x27; Company.

==Heirs and successors==
John Bowyer Nichols continued his father&#x27;s various undertakings, and wrote, with other works, &quot;A Brief Account of the Guildhall of the City of London&quot; (1819).

John Gough Nichols (1806–73), John Bowyer Nichols&#x27;s eldest son, was also a printer and a distinguished antiquary. He edited the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1851 to 1856 and &quot;The Herald and Genealogist&quot; from 1863 to 1874, and was one of the founders of the Camden Society.

It is understood that William Nichols Higton was given his middle name by his father, the artist John Higton, in honour of their friendship, and that Nichols was his godfather.

==Bibliography==
A full &quot;Memoir of John Nichols&quot; by Alexander Chalmers is contained in the &quot;Illustrations&quot;, and a bibliography in the &quot;Anecdotes&quot; (vol. vi.) is supplemented in the later work. See also Robert Cradock Nichols, &quot;Memoir of the late John Gough Nichols, F.S.A.&quot; (1874).

<text>Richard Gough (21 October 1735 – 20 February 1809) was an English antiquarian. He served as director of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 1771 to 1791; published a major work on English church monuments; and translated and edited a new edition of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;.

He is not to be confused with the Richard Gough who wrote a &quot;History of Myddle&quot;, Shropshire, in 1700.

==Life==
Gough was born in London, where his father, Harry Gough, was a prosperous director of the British East India Company and also a member of parliament. In 1751 he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he began his work on British topography, eventually published in 1768. Leaving Cambridge in 1756, without a degree, he began a series of antiquarian excursions in various parts of Great Britain.

Gough was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1767, and was its director from 1771 to 1791. As director, he urged the Society to increase the scope of its publications, especially as a means of recording England&#x27;s Gothic architecture; as the intermittent series &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot; was the only record of its research. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1775. His books and manuscripts relating to Anglo-Saxon and northern literature, all his collections in the department of British topography, and a large number of his drawings and engravings of other archaeological remains, were bequeathed to the University of Oxford. One notable item in the bequest is the so-called Gough Map, an outstanding medieval map of Britain, which is now known by Gough&#x27;s name.

==Works==
Gough was a precocious child, and at twelve had translated from the French a history of the Bible, which his mother printed for private circulation. Aged fifteen he translated Abbé Claude Fleury&#x27;s work on the Israelites; and at sixteen he published an elaborate work entitled &quot;Atlas Renovatus&quot;, or &quot;Geography modernised&quot;. In 1773 he began an edition in English of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;: this was published in 1789, with a second edition appearing in 1806.

Meantime he published, in 1786, the first volume of his work the &quot;Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain, applied to illustrate the history of families, manners, habits and arts at the different periods from the Norman Conquest to the Seventeenth Century&quot;. This volume, which contained the first four centuries, was followed in 1796 by a second volume containing the 15th century, and an introduction to the second volume appeared in 1799.

Among Gough&#x27;s minor works are &quot;An Account of the Bedford Missal&quot; (in manuscript); &quot;A Catalogue of the Coins of Canute, King of Denmark&quot; (1777); &quot;History of Pleshey in Essex&quot; (1803); &quot;An Account of the Coins of the Seleucidae, Kings of Syria&quot; (1804); and &quot;History of the Society of Antiquaries of London,&quot; prefixed to their &quot;Archaeologia&quot;.

<text>Mohammed Siad Barre (, Osmanya script: , &quot;Muhammad Ziād Barīy&quot;; 6 October 1909 – 2 January 1995) was a Somali military officer, politician and revolutionary who served as the third president of Somalia from 21 October 1969 to 26 January 1991.

Barre, the commander of the Somali National Army, became president of Somalia after the 1969 coup d&#x27;état that overthrew the Somali Republic following the assassination of President Abdirashid Shermarke. The Supreme Revolutionary Council military junta under Barre reconstituted Somalia as a one-party Marxist–Leninist communist state, renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic and adopted scientific socialism. Barre spoke three languages, English, Somali and Italian.

Barre&#x27;s early rule was characterised by attempts at widespread modernization, nationalization of banks and industry, promotion of cooperative farms, a new writing system for the Somali language, and anti-tribalism. In 1976, the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party became the country&#x27;s vanguard party. The following year Barre launched the Ogaden War against Ethiopia&#x27;s Derg regime, supporting the Western Somali Liberation Front on a platform of Somali nationalism and pan-Somalism. Barre&#x27;s popularity was highest during the seven months between September 1977 and March 1978 when Barre captured virtually the entirety of the Somali region. It declined from the late-1970s following Somalia&#x27;s defeat in the Ogaden War, triggering the Somali Rebellion and severing ties with the Soviet Union. Somalia then allied itself with the Western powers and especially the United States for the remainder of the Cold War, although it maintained its Marxist–Leninist regime and also drew close to China.

Opposition grew in the 1980s due to his increasingly dictatorial rule, growth of tribal politics, abuses of the National Security Service including the Isaaq genocide, and the sharp decline of Somalia&#x27;s economy. In 1991, Barre&#x27;s government collapsed as the Somali Rebellion successfully ejected him from power, leading to the Somali Civil War and a massive power vacuum in its wake. Barre was forced into exile in Nigeria, where he died in 1995 on the way to the hospital after suffering a heart attack.

== Early years ==
Mohamed Siad Barre was born at a time when birth records were unknown in Somalia. Speculations have been cast upon his exact birth year ranging from 1909 to 1921; nevertheless, it is generally agreed that he was born to pastoral parents circa 1910. His unofficial birthplace is said to be in Las Ga&#x27;al, which is a district of the El-Gab region, presently known as Shilavo (Shilabo) in the Ogaden Region of Ethiopia. His official birthplace is recorded to be the city of Garbahare, which is a part of the provincial capital of the Gedo region of Somalia. Mohammed was born to a Marehan father and Ogaden mother of the greater Darod clan. The colonial powers prevented ethnic Somalis born outside the two protectorates (Italian and British) from conscribing into their respective territorial forces. By concealing his unofficial birthplace like many others, it enabled him to be eligible for the Italian colonial police force and military in Somalia.

Barre&#x27;s father and brother died when he was ten years old as a result of a raid by the Habr Yunis in the early 20th century, and this event is posited by some scholars to have deeply affected him.
The Middle East monthly in their March 1991 issue stated:Barre came from a humble background, deeply rooted in the Marehan sub-clan of the Darod. He had seen his father killed by Isaqs and the impression never left him. His clan straddled the British and Italian segments of Somalia, forming a minority in each. He was worried that the country could split in two and in either case, his clan, as a minority, would be shut out of power. He became an inspector of police and later went to Italy to attend a military academy. On his return, he rose through the ranks quickly to become Commander.
 
Author Mohamed Diiriye in his book Culture and Customs of Somalia, writes:
 Many who knew Barre from his boyhood and during his stint in the colonial police under the Italians were not that surprised. Barre was not a normal person; he was a psychopath whose mercurial spirit vacillated between raving hatred in one moment and words of praise and reconciliation the next moment. He was said to have witnessed the murder of his own father when he was only ten years old during the turbulent year of 1921, when the clan conflicts instigated by Mohamed Abdulle Hassan were raging across the land.. Barre was reportedly forever after deeply marked by the murder of his father. He became sadistic..
In &quot;The History of Somalia&quot; Raphael Njoku says:
According to his biographers, at the tender age of 10, young Muhammad first witnessed the murder of his own father...The shock and impact of this life experience and the difficult circumstances of life as an orphan put a very deep scar in his psyche. It is from this difficult childhood that Barre developed a complex sense of cunning, sadism, insecurity, and vengeance. These behavioural traits were exacerbated and solidified under the Italian fascist colonial rule.

He was given the childhood nickname &quot;Barre&quot;, referring to extrovertedness. Barre later on participated as a Zaptié in the southern theatre of the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936. In 1946, Barre supported the Somali Conference (), a political group of parties and clan associations that were hostile to the Somali Youth League and were supported by the local Italian settlers. The group presented a petition to the &quot;Four Powers&quot; Investigation Commission in order to allow that the administration of the United Nations Trust Territory could be entrusted for thirty years to Italy.
Throughout much of his life, Mohammed Siad Barre dedicated himself to both formal and self-taught education whilst gradually advancing his prospective career. Mohammed, as a child and orphan by the age of 10, attended the elementary school in the town of Lugh (Luuq) in the Gedo Region, formally known as the Upper Jubba Region. He acquired the usual grounding in Islam at a qur&#x27;anic school there. In 1941, Mohammed, aged twenty, joined the police force which was then under the authority of the British military, who occupied it since the initiation of World War II hostilities. Mohammed&#x27;s career in the police force led him to the capital city, Mogadishu, to pursue his education both in the public and private sectors. In the 1940s he completed secondary school education. By 1950, when the British transferred their administration to Italy, Mohammed Siad had achieved the highest rank possible for an indigenous, that of chief police inspector.

In 1952, he and several of his colleagues, including Hussein Kulmiye Afrah, Liiq-Liiqato, Shegow and Daud Abdulle, attended military academy in Italy where he chiefly studied politics and administration. Between 1950 and 1960, Mohammed Siad heavily pursued studies in languages, ultimately mastering Italian, English and Swahili. After finishing his course he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. In 1955, a year after completing his course in Rome he was awarded he position of police chief and subsequently assigned to the capital city, Mogadishu. By 1958 he reached the rank of major whilst being the head of the security forces, including the executive director of the Italian police. He also eventually became vice-commander of the Somali Army when the country gained its independence in 1960 as the Somali Republic.

In the early 1960s, after spending time with Soviet officers in joint training exercises, Barre became an advocate of Soviet-style Marxist-Leninist government, believing in a socialist government and a stronger sense of Somali nationalism.

== Seizure of power ==

In the late 1960s, the only governmental institution that seemed free from the unabated corruption and nepotism was the armed forces. Ninety percent of the pre-independence army were members of the Somali Youth League and Somali National League. During the colonial administration, the Somali police force was the first institution be Somalised and full command was handed over to the indigenous officers several years prior to independence. During the first decade of the Republic of Somalia, armed forces already had a reputation for excellence under the exceptional leadership of Brigadier Generals Barre and Daud Abdulle. A remarkable impact was the successful integration of the former British and Italian-trained units, thereby outpacing the civilian attempts to integrate. Both the police and the military, especially the military, engaged in self-help schemes, something the civilian authorities did not attain. Considerably important was the fact that the armed forces were never detached from the public. Highly imaginative public relations staging of traditional dances and drama, poetry and music competitions, sports activities and so forth, did much to give them positive public image, plus a reputation for dedication. Therefore, the public had an anticipated confidence that they would step in if constitutional processes and public were to break down. This distinguished the Somali army from the majority of the African armies that had become a personal machine available to the power struggles. Another factor that contributed to the detachment of what was raging in the political arena was the national awareness they developed after independence, which was basically the unity of the Somali country as its hinterland. This awareness gained strength by the evident corruption perpetrated by the political class which increased their conviction that they were the only healthy and functioning force in the young Republic.

The brief border war against Ethiopia in 1964 was fought under conditions of grave unpreparedness in where the army was cut off from its own lines whilst the government became more and more corrupt, which in turn provided food for resentment and hostility towards the regime that was already incapable as well as impotent and dishonest. The conditions created for a political will to mature and expand were aimed at national renewal that was particularly aware of the sufferings and exploitation of the Somali population.

In 1966, General Siad Barre, then head of the armed forces, gave an interview to the Italian newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot;. During his interview, he outlined his dissatisfaction with the current regime shared by the local populace and provided reasons for a new political vision, which had the clear plan of a profound change of course in Somalia that would be automatically linked with the people and their needs. Questioned whether the Armed Forces were ready for a coup d&#x27;état, General Siad remarked that the Somali Army considered itself exclusively &quot;In the service of the people, not only for the defense of the frontiers, but to help its political, economic and social progress.&quot; (Unita, 1966) He then added, &quot;whoever wants to keep the people in poverty and in ignorance is our enemy,&quot; thereby referring to the nepotistic and severely corrupted SYL administration. It can thus be said that the Somali Armed Forces formed its own character until it reached a stage of having a force that had deep-rooted democratic and progressive convictions, which they could step in at any time to provide the necessary change.

Several patriotic intellectuals, who denounced both the civilian regime and the ruling class, made several pleas for an intervention of the Armed Forces. Amongst them was a journalist and a politician, Ismail Jimale, who directed the socialist newspaper &quot;La Tribunal&quot;. However, Jimale, a vehement critic, gave in when Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal invited him to form part of his cabinet as the minister of information.

On 15 October 1969, President Abdirashid Shermake was assassinated in Las Anod by a policeman whilst touring a drought stricken area of northern Somalia. At the time, Prime Minister Egal was on a state visit to the United States, and was in Las Vegas when the assassination was conveyed to him. Fearing that he would lose his position, he returned to Somalia to nominate a new successor. Several members of the parliament recommended that a candidate belonging to the same sub-clan as the assassinated president should inherit the post. It was suggested that Haji Muse Bogor, a Mogadishu businessman and close relative of the assassinated president, be elected, methodology that opposed the very constitution of the newly founded state. Others members simply sold their votes to the highest bidder. As a result, a bidding war was initiated where corrupt candidates were bidding on the price of the presidency. Not surprisingly, Haji Muse Bogor was leading the group with a payment of 55,000 Somali shillings (approximately £4,000). In the eyes of the public, the subsequent days after the assassination of the president displayed total chaos. There were rumours that the military would intervene to put a halt to this apparent degeneration. The majority were hopeful to see these rumours bear fruit, as the support they had for the venal government was diminishing by the hour. In the early hours of 21 October 1969, when the members of the parliament finally decided to present the presidency to the highest bidder, Haji Muse Bogor, military troops aided by armored cars in the major cities of Somalia to occupy key positions. Before the crack of dawn, all the members of parliament, several politicians linked to tribal chiefs or foreign interests were arrested by the police, headed by General Jama Ali Korshel, backed the takeover and somehow played a subordinate role in the coup.

The coup baffled many western observers who ignorantly saw Somalia as a remarkably stable and &quot;democratic country&quot;. After all, the Somali armed forces, both in military and police had hardly ever tried to influence the politics of the post-independence governments. Nevertheless, when the military decided to step in, it was a response to the increasingly inept and corrupt regime, which not only aggravated the armed sector but the majority of the Somali population.

Barre (June 1970) re-affirmed the sentiment of the masses when he described the very model of the post-independence regimes were based upon &quot;the long period during which there have been over a hundred parties in Somalia and a parliament of not even two hundred members, served solely to demonstrate in the most convincing of manner that the models of colonial countries transferred to Africa serve only the new-colonial purposes of said countries, and not certainly to develop forms of democracy in keeping with African realities.&quot; (Barre, 1971)

On 24 October, in a broadcast speech, General Siad Barre explained the reason behind the take-over.

== Presidency ==

Barre assumed the position of president of Somalia, styled the &quot;Victorious Leader&quot; (&quot;Guulwade&quot;), and fostered the growth of a personality cult with portraits of him in the company of Marx and Lenin lining the streets on public occasions. Barre advocated a form of scientific socialism based on the Qur&#x27;an and Marxism-Leninism, with heavy influences of Somali nationalism.

=== Supreme Revolutionary Council ===
The Supreme Revolutionary Council established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. Barre began a program of nationalising industry and land, and the new regime&#x27;s foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia&#x27;s traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League in 1974. That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union (AU).

In July 1976, Barre&#x27;s SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP), a one-party government based on scientific socialism and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration&#x27;s overall direction was proclaimed to be Communist.

A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People&#x27;s Assembly were held. However, the politburo of Barre&#x27;s Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place.

=== Nationalism and Greater Somalia ===
Barre advocated the concept of a Greater Somalia (&quot;Soomaaliweyn&quot;), which refers to those regions in the Horn of Africa in which ethnic Somalis reside and have historically represented the predominant population, encompassing Somalia, Djibouti, the Ogaden in Ethiopia, and Kenya&#x27;s former North Eastern Province.

In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the Barre&#x27;s government sought to incorporate the various Somali-inhabited territories of the region into a Greater Somalia, beginning with the Ogaden. The Somali national army invaded Ethiopia, which was then under communist rule of the Soviet-backed Derg, and was successful at first, capturing most of the territory of the Ogaden. The invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union&#x27;s shift of support to Ethiopia, followed by almost the entire communist world siding against Somalia. The Soviets halted their previous supplies to Barre&#x27;s regime and increased the distribution of aid, weapons, and training to the Ethiopian government, and also brought in around 15,000 Cuban troops to assist the Ethiopian regime. In 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden.

=== Foreign relations ===

Control of Somalia was of great interest to both the Soviet Union and the United States due to the country&#x27;s strategic location at the mouth of the Red Sea. After the Soviets broke with Somalia in the late 1970s, Barre subsequently expelled all Soviet advisors, tore up his friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, and switched allegiance to the West, announcing this in a televised speech in English. Somalia also broke all ties with the Eastern Bloc and the Second World (except China and Romania). The United States stepped in and until 1989, was a strong supporter of the Barre government for whom it provided approximately US$100 million per year in economic and military aid, meeting in 1982 with Ronald Reagan to announce the new relationship between the US and Somalia.

In September 1972 Tanzanian-sponsored rebels attacked Uganda. Ugandan president Idi Amin requested Barre&#x27;s assistance, and he subsequently mediated a non-aggression pact between Tanzania and Uganda. For his actions, a road in Kampala was named after Barre.

On 17 and 18 October 1977, a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) group hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 to Mogadishu, holding 86 hostages. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Barre negotiated a deal to allow a GSG 9 anti-terrorist unit into Mogadishu to free the hostages.

In January 1986, Barre and the Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam met in Djibouti to normalise relations between their respective countries. The Ethiopian-Somali agreement was signed by 1988 and Barre disbanded his clandestine anti-Ethiopian organisation the Western Somali Liberation Front. In return, Barre hoped that Mengistu would disarm Somali National Movement rebels active on the Ethiopian side of the border; however did this not materialise since the SNM relocated to Northern Somalia in response to this agreement.

=== Domestic programs ===
During the first five years, Barre&#x27;s government set up several cooperative farms and factories of mass production such as mills, sugar cane processing facilities in Jowhar and Afgooye, and a meat processing house in Kismayo.

Another public project initiated by the government was the Shalanbood Sanddune Stoppage: from 1971 onwards, a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by Barre&#x27;s administration to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind-driven sand dunes that threatened to engulf towns, roads, and farmland. By 1988, of a projected had been treated, with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established.

Between 1974 and 1975, a major drought referred to as the &quot;Abaartii Dabadheer&quot; (&quot;The Lingering Drought&quot;) occurred in the northern regions of Somalia. The Soviet Union, which at the time maintained strategic relations with the Barre government, airlifted some 90,000 people from the devastated regions of Hobyo and Aynaba. New settlements of small villages were created in the &quot;Jubbada Hoose&quot; (Lower Juba) and &quot;Jubbada Dhexe&quot; (Middle Juba) regions, with these new settlements known as the &quot;Danwadaagaha&quot; or &quot;Collective Settlements&quot;. The transplanted families were introduced to farming and fishing, a change from their traditional pastoralist lifestyle of livestock herding. Other such resettlement programs were also introduced as part of Barre&#x27;s effort to undercut clan solidarity by dispersing nomads and moving them away from clan-controlled land.

=== Economic policies ===
As part of Barre&#x27;s socialist policies, major industries and farms were nationalised, including banks, insurance companies and oil distribution farms. By the mid- to late-1970s, public discontent with the Barre regime was increasing, largely due to corruption among government officials as well as poor economic performance. The Ogaden War had also weakened the Somali army substantially and military spending had crippled the economy. Foreign debt increased faster than export earnings, and by the end of the decade, Somalia&#x27;s debt of 4 billion shillings equalled the earnings from seventy-five years&#x27; worth of banana exports.

By 1978, manufactured goods exports were almost non-existent, and with the lost support of the Soviet Union the Barre government signed a structural adjustment agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the early 1980s. This included the abolishment of some government monopolies and increased public investment. This and a second agreement were both cancelled by the mid-1980s, as the Somali army refused to accept a proposed 60 percent cut in military spending. New agreements were made with the Paris Club, the International Development Association and the IMF during the second half of the 1980s. This ultimately failed to improve the economy which deteriorated rapidly in 1989 and 1990, and resulted in nationwide commodity shortages.

=== Car collision ===
In May 1986, President Barre suffered serious injuries in a life-threatening automobile collision near Mogadishu, when the car that was transporting him smashed into the back of a bus during a heavy rainstorm. He was treated in a hospital in Saudi Arabia for head injuries, broken ribs and shock over a period of a month. Lieutenant General Mohammad Ali Samatar, then vice-president, subsequently served as de facto head of state for the next several months. Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for re-election over a term of seven years on 23 December 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power. Possible contenders included his son-in-law General Ahmed Suleiman Abdille, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior, in addition to Barre&#x27;s vice-president Lt. Gen. Samatar.

=== Human rights abuses ===

Part of Barre&#x27;s time in power was characterized by oppressive dictatorial rule, including persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents. The United Nations Development Programme stated that &quot;the 21-year regime of Siyad Barre had one of the worst human rights records in Africa.&quot; In January 1990, the Africa Watch Committee, a branch of Human Rights Watch organizational released an extensive report titled &quot;Somalia A Government At War with Its Own People&quot; composing of 268 pages, the report highlights the widespread violations of basic human rights in the northern regions of Somalia. The report includes testimonies about the killing and conflict in northern Somalia by newly arrived refugees in various countries around the world. Systematic human rights abuses against the dominant Isaaq clan in the north was described in the report as &quot;state sponsored terrorism&quot; &quot;both the urban population and nomads living in the countryside [were] subjected to summary killings, arbitrary arrest, detention in squalid conditions, torture, rape, crippling constraints on freedom of movement and expression and a pattern of psychological intimidation. The report estimates that 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed from 1988 to 1989.&quot; Amnesty International went on to report that torture methods committed by Barre&#x27;s National Security Service (NSS) included executions and &quot;beatings while tied in a contorted position, electric shocks, rape of woman prisoners, simulated executions and death threats.&quot;

In September 1970, the government introduced the National Security Law No. 54, which granted the NSS the power to arrest and detain indefinitely those who expressed critical views of the government, without ever being brought to trial. It further gave the NSS the power to arrest without a warrant anyone suspected of a crime involving &quot;national security&quot;. Article 1 of the law prohibited &quot;acts against the independence, unity or security of the State&quot;, and capital punishment was mandatory for anyone convicted of such acts.

From the late 1970s, and onwards Barre faced a shrinking popularity and increased domestic resistance. In response, Barre&#x27;s elite unit, the Red Berets (&quot;Duub Cas&quot;), and the paramilitary unit called the Victory Pioneers carried out systematic terror against the Majeerteen, Hawiye, and Isaaq clans. The Red Berets systematically smashed water reservoirs to deny water to the Majeerteen and Isaaq clans and their herds. More than 2,000 members of the Majeerteen clan died of thirst, and an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 Isaaq were killed by the government. Members of the Victory Pioneers also raped large numbers of Majeerteen and Isaaq women, and more than 500,000 Isaaq members fled to Ethiopia.

In January 1979 Barre ordered the execution of ten sheiks who were arrested for their religious beliefs. The religious community had begun to exhibit opposition to Barre&#x27;s furthered attempt to secularize Somalia. This egregious violation of freedom of speech was condemned by Amnesty International. Many Somalis believe this event was the tipping point that led to the state&#x27;s eventual failure.

=== Clannism ===
After the Ogaden War, Barre adopted a &quot;clannism&quot; ideology and abandoned his &quot;socialist facade&quot; to hold onto power. A 120,000 strong army was built for internal repression of the public and to encourage rural clan based conflicts in addition to urban clan directed massacres by specialised armed forces. Barre also singled out the Isaaq clan for a &quot;neo-fascist&quot; type punishment resulting in a &quot;semi-colonial&quot; type subjugation which fuelled collective self assertion to supporters of the Somali National Movement.

By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by Ethiopia&#x27;s communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, Barre&#x27;s son-in-law, and resulted in the deaths of 50,000 people in the north.

=== Rebellion and ouster ===

After fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign, Barre&#x27;s administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the 1978 coup d&#x27;état attempt. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre&#x27;s regime by force.

A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People&#x27;s Assembly were held. However, Barre and the politburo of his Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. By that time, the moral authority of Barre&#x27;s ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council had begun to weaken. Many Somalis were becoming disillusioned with life under military dictatorship. The regime was further weakened in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and Somalia&#x27;s strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia&#x27;s communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre&#x27;s regime and the disbandment of the Somali National Army (SNA). Among the militia groups that led the rebellion were the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), United Somali Congress (USC), Somali National Movement (SNM) and the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the Somali Democratic Movement (SDM), the Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG). Siad Barre escaped from his palace towards the Kenyan border in a tank.
Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ousting of Barre&#x27;s regime. In the south in particular, armed factions led by USC commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.

== Exile and death ==

After fleeing Mogadishu on 26 January 1991 with his son-in-law General Morgan, Barre temporarily remained in Burdhubo, in southwestern Somalia, his family&#x27;s stronghold. The former dictator fled in a tank filled with reserves from the Somali central bank. This included gold and foreign currency estimated to have been worth $27 million.

From there, he launched a military campaign to return to power. He twice attempted to retake Mogadishu, but in May 1991 was overwhelmed by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s army and forced into exile. Barre initially moved to Nairobi, Kenya, but opposition groups there protested his arrival and the Kenyan government&#x27;s support for him. In response to the pressure and hostilities, he moved two weeks later to Nigeria. Barre died of a heart attack on 2 January 1995, in Lagos.

<doc id="242379" wikidata="Q464555" url="?curid=242379" title="Peronism">
<text>Peronism, also known as justicialism, is an Argentine ideology and movement based on the ideas, doctrine and legacy of Juan Perón (1895–1974). It has been an influential movement in 20th- and 21st-century Argentine politics. Since 1946, Peronists have won 10 out of the 14 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. Peronism is defined through its three flags, which are: &quot;economic independence&quot; (an economy that does not depend on other countries, by developing its national industry), &quot;social justice&quot; (the fight against socioeconomic inequalities) and &quot;political sovereignty&quot; (the non-interference of foreign powers in domestic affairs).

Peronism as an ideology is described as a social form of nationalism, as it pushes for a sense of national pride among Argentines. However, it promotes an inclusive form of nationalism that embraces all ethnicities and races as integral parts of the nation, distinguishing it from racial or chauvinistic ethno-nationalism that prioritizes a single ethnic group. This is because of the ethnically heterogeneous background of Argentina, which is a result of the mixing between indigenous peoples, Criollos, the various immigrant groups and their descendants. Likewise, Peronism is generally considered populist, since it needs the figure of a leader (originally occupied by Perón) to lead the masses. Consequently, it adopts a third position in the context of the Cold War, expressed in the phrase: &quot;we are neither Yankees nor Marxists&quot;.

Peronism has taken both conservative and progressive measures. Among its conservative elements are anti-communist sentiments (although abandoned in some instances), a strong patriotism, a militarist approach and the sanction of a law on Catholic teaching in public schools; while its progressive measures include the expansion of workers&#x27; rights, the adoption of women&#x27;s suffrage, free tuition for public universities, and a failed attempt to sanction the divorce law after the breakdown of relations with the church. Peronism granted the working class a genuine role in government and enacted reforms that eroded the power of the Argentine oligarchy. Peronist reforms also included a constitutional right to housing, ending the oppression of indigenous peoples, adding mandatory trade union representation to regional legislature, freezing retail prices and subsidizing foodstuffs to the workers.

Perón followed what he called a &quot;national form of socialism&quot;, which represented the interests of different sectors of Argentine society, and grouped them into multiple organizations: workers were represented by the CGT, Peronist businessmen in the General Economic Confederation, landowners by the Argentine Agrarian Federation, women by the Female Peronist Party, Jews in the Argentine Israelite Organization, students in the Secondary Student Union. Peron was able to coordinate and centralize the working class, which he mobilized to act on his behest. Trade unions have been incorporated into Peronism&#x27;s structure and remain a key part of the movement today. Also, the state intervened in labor-capital conflicts in favour of the former, with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security being responsible for directly negotiating and enforcing agreements.

Perón became Argentina&#x27;s labour secretary after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition, he supported industrialists in an effort to facilitate harmony between labor and capital. Perón was very popular due to his leadership, and gained even more admiration through his wife Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers, the poor, and women, whose suffrage is partially due to Eva&#x27;s involvement, until her death by cancer in 1952. Due to economic problems and political repression, the military overthrew Perón and banned the Justicialist Party in 1955; it was not until 1973 that open elections were held again in which Perón was re-elected president by 62%. Perón died in the following year, opening the way for his widow and vice president Isabel to succeed the presidency. During the Peronists&#x27; second period in office from 1973 to 1976, various social provisions were improved.

Perón&#x27;s death left an intense power vacuum and the military promptly overthrew Isabel in 1976. Since the return to democracy in 1983, Peronist candidates have won several general elections. The candidate for Peronism, Carlos Menem, was elected in 1989 and served for two consecutive terms until 1999. Menem abandoned the traditional Peronist policies, focusing on the adoption of free-market policies, the privatization of state enterprises, and pro-US foreign policy. In 1999, Fernando De La Rúa would win the presidential elections allied to a large sector of Peronists who denounced Menem. After the De La Rúa administration collapsed in 2001, four &quot;interim&quot; Peronist leaders took over between 2001 and 2003 due to political turmoil of the Argentine Great Depression. After coming to power in the 2003 Argentine general election, Néstor Kirchner restructured the Justicialist platform and returned to classical left-wing populism of Perón, reverting the movement&#x27;s detour to free-market capitalism under Carlos Menem. Kirchner served for only one term, while his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, served two (having been elected in 2007 and re-elected in 2011). From 2019 until 2023, Cristina Kirchner was vice president and Alberto Fernández president. , Peronists have held the presidency in Argentina for 39 total years.

== Overview ==

===Classification===
Peronism is generally considered to be a variant of left-wing populism or a broadly left-wing ideology; however, political scientists such as Anthony W. Pereira also note that left-wing populists such as Perón &quot;may share important elements with their right-wing counterparts.&quot; Carlos de la Torre and Oscar Mazzoleni also stressed this ambiguity, arguing that the main difference between left-wing and right-wing populisms is the economic focus of the former and social focus of the latter. Political scientist Pierre Ostiguy argues that it is &quot;structural and intuitive&quot; to classify Peronism as left-leaning, especially given its electoral base and dependency on trade unions. He added that &quot;Perón could absolutely not, as the ordinary working class well understood, be considered on the right. He thus shared a position with the leftist political parties, in the opposite camp.&quot; Pierre Ostiguy defined it as &quot;a brand of populism that sought to deny elites’ and capitalism&#x27;s power, empower working class constituents, and help the politically and economically oppressed.&quot;

However, some described Peronism as a Latin American form of fascism instead. Criticizing identifying Peronism as right-wing or fascism, Robert D. Crassweller remarked: &quot;a movement whose founder spends his life combating the economic and social elite, whose great contribution was to bring the anonymous masses into the political and economic mainstream, and whose lifelong electoral base was principally organized labor, can hardly be deemed rightist.&quot; Beyond Perón, the Peronist movement itself has many factions - Kirchnerism and revolutionary Peronism on the left, and Federal Peronism and Orthodox Peronism on the right. The Justicialist Party created by Perón is generally placed on the left of the political spectrum.

Peronism is described as socialist by many political scientists, classified as a variant of nationalist socialism, paternalistic socialism, non-Marxist socialism, and Catholic socialism. Political scientists supporting this view note that Perón created a planned and heavily regulated economy, with &quot;a massive public sector of nationalized industries and social services&quot; that was &quot;redistributive in nature&quot; and prioritized workers&#x27; benefits and the empowerment of trade unions. Perón&#x27;s close relationship with a socialist leader Juan José Arévalo and his extensive support for the Bolivian National Revolution are also considered arguments in favor of this view. Additionally, despite promoting a concept of a &quot;Third Way&quot; between the &#x27;imperialisms&#x27; of the United States and Soviet Union, Perón supported and became a close ally of the Cuban Revolution, Salvador Allende of Chile, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is also noted that the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, despite being born in an anti-Peronist family, considered Peronism &quot;a kind of indigenous Latin American socialism with which the Cuban Revolution could side&quot;. Perón thought is considered a genuine socialist ideology by some Marxist writers such as Samir Amin, José María Aricó, Dieter Boris, and Donald C. Hodges.

Summarizing the historical and political debates on the ideological nature of Peronism, Czech political scientists Pavlína Springerová and Jiří Chalupa stressed the dominance of the view that Peronism was some kind of socialism, and wrote: &quot;Historians and political scientists over time defined Peronism as Christian socialism, national socialism, demagogic dictatorship, plebiscitary presidential system, state socialism, non-Marxist collectivism, worker democracy or national capitalism&quot;. Some historians also consider Peronism to be a variant of Nasserism, which defines it as an ideology based on &quot;middle-class military men who would utilize the armed forces to forge a socialist transformation of society.&quot; Mariano Mestman wrote that &quot;Peronism was proposing a type of Socialism at times called ‘national’, different from that postulated by the classical Marxist left but no less revolutionary&quot;.

There are also alternative evaluations of Peronism that go beyond the most common labels for Peronism such as socialism, fascism, or arguments that Peronism transcends the left-right divide. Some scholars evaluated Peronism as a social democratic ideology instead, or even paternalistic conservatism, with a mixture of militant labourism and traditional conservatism. However, whether Peronism was conservative is heavily disputed, as the proponents of Peronism see it as socially progressive. Peronism has also been described as socially progressive by some political analysts, as well as by historians such as Luis Alberto Romero. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party, whose policies have significantly varied over time and across government administrations, but have generally been described as &quot;a vague blend of nationalism and labourism&quot;, or populism. Alan Knight argues that Peronism is similar to Bolivarian Revolution and the Mexican Revolution in terms of consequences and ideology, noting that while Peronism was &quot;socially progressive, but politically ambiguous&quot;, it brought the Argentinian working class significant material benefits as well as political empowerment and social inclusion. Ultimately, Knight recommends the term &quot;revolutionary populism&quot; for Peronism.

===Self-description===
Perón himself described his ideology and his movement as left-wing, writing in September 1973: &quot;Peronism is a left-wing movement. But the left that we advocate is a Justicialist left above all things; it is not a communist or anarchist left. It is a Justicialist left that wants to achieve a community where each Argentine can flourish.&quot; Perón argued that his main goal was to implement and declare &quot;economic independence&quot; of Argentina, which he sought to achieve by nationalization of Argentinian resources, state control of the economy, curtailing multinational and foreign companies, redistribution of wealth, asserting the &quot;power of the working class&quot;, and abolishing capitalism that the Peronists denounced as elitist and &quot;antinational&quot;. By 1973, the slogan adopted by Perón became &quot;dependency or liberation&quot;. In July 1971, Perón also claimed that his ideology of justicialism is socialist:
However, despite Perón&#x27;s declarations, the movement itself was split into left-wing and right-wing factions, vying for supremacy within the movement. While all Peronists claimed to adhere to the ideas of Perón, their interpretation of Perón&#x27;s intentions varied greatly. Left-wing Peronists believed that the goal of Perón was to establish &quot;the socialist nation&quot;, while right-wing Peronists argued that Perón&#x27;s vision is more similar to corporatism rather than socialism, and that Perón&#x27;s vision is one of establishing an &quot;organized community&quot;. Perón himself used very vague terms such as &quot;socialismo nacional&quot; (&quot;national socialism&quot;), which he described as being based on Christian social values and aiming to overthrow the &quot;imperialist slavery&quot; of Argentina. Here, Perón argued that his version of socialism was not Marxist but Christian, and that it was a &quot;national variant of socialism&quot;, and that it differed from capitalism on the basis of being a &quot;just social order&quot;. While seemingly favoring the left-wing Peronism, Perón&#x27;s &quot;national socialism&quot; was interpreted in very diverse ways, including being conflated with Nazism by fringe groups of far-right Peronists. The commonly accepted interpretation however, is that Perón meant &quot;a ‘national’ road to socialism, understood as a system of economic socialization and popular power respectful of specific national conditions and traditions.&quot;

Perón consistently identified with socialist figures - he praised Che Guevara, and spoke sympathically of Mao Zedong as “this little Chinese man who steals my ideas.” He described Peronism as national form of socialism that was to end the capitalist exploitation of Argentina and fight imperialism. Perón expressed deep affinity to Maoism, writing: &quot;The refusal of Mao to side with colonialism lays the foundation of the ‘Third World’ in which the different socialist democracies can get along perfectly. There is no reason for nationalism and socialism to quarrel. Both can unite with the common objective of liberating the pueblos.&quot; Perón additionally stated that &quot;Marxism is not only not in contradiction with the Peronist Movement, but complements it.&quot;; he excused his initially anti-communist rhetoric as opposition to the Argentine &quot;communist orthodoxy&quot; that opposed him, which he considered to be &quot;on the side of the oligarchy or Braden&#x27;s arm&quot;.

===Development===
Peronism gained popularity in Argentina after the failure of its government to listen and recognize the needs of its middle class. As president of Argentina, Hipólito Yrigoyen did not listen to the workers&#x27; pleas for better wages and better working conditions after World War I. Yrigoyen was notorious for failing to oppose Argentina&#x27;s oligarchy. According to Teresa Meade in &quot;A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present&quot;, Yrigoyen failed &quot;to establish a middle-class-based political system from 1916 to 1930 – mainly because his Radical Civic Union had neither the will nor the means to effectively oppose the dominance of the oligarchy&quot;. Many in power did not work to change the way things were. However, Juan Perón, at that time a military officer, used his experiences in Europe and political power to create a new political atmosphere that he felt would better the lives of citizens in Argentina.

Unlike Yrigoyen, Perón &quot;recognized that the industrial working class was not necessarily an impediment, and could be mobilized to serve as the basis for building a corporatist state that joined the interests of labor with those of at least a large section of the national bourgeoisie to promote a nationalist agenda&quot;.

Perón was yet unknown to the general public in the 1930s, but he already had high respect in the Argentinian army; he served as a military attaché between 1938 and 1940, and quickly gained a prestigious political position following the 1943 Argentine coup d&#x27;état. He took over the Labor Department in October 1943 and started cementing his reputation as the ally of the Argentinian trade unions, describing himself as a &quot;labor unionist&quot; (&quot;sindicalista&quot;) in an interview with a Chilean journalist. In November 1943, the national labour department was replaced by a new department for labour and welfare, which gave Perón enormous influence over the economy. Perón presented himself as a Catholic labourist committed to the ideals of &quot;harmony&quot; and &quot;distributive justice&quot;. First breakthrough in his political career came with the settlement with Unión Ferroviaria in December 1943, which was the largest railroad union in Argentina at the time. Perón &quot;offered the union almost everything it had been seeking, until now in vain, during the past fifteen years&quot;, which gave him the reputation of the &quot;Argentina&#x27;s Number One Worker&quot; amongst railroad unionists.

In January 1944, General Pedro Pablo Ramírez fell from power following the revelation of secret negotiations between Nazi Germany and Argentinian junta. The junta was forced to break diplomatic relations with the Axis and purge its cabinet of pro-Axis members. Ramírez was replaced by moderate Edelmiro Julián Farrell, which prompted protests from nationalist circles - in Tucumán, flags on government buildings flew at half-mast in sign of protest. Perón further expanded his power, as he took over the ministry of war that Farrell commanded before becoming president. In March 1944, railroad workers organized a demonstration in support of Perón, and in June, he was able to take control over metalworkers&#x27; union Unión Obrera Metalúrgica. Perón&#x27;s speech from 11 June introduced the concept of &quot;nation in arms&quot;, where he called war an inevitable consequence of human condition. According to Perón, a nation could win a war only if it would &quot;develop true . . . solidarity [and] create a strong sense of discipline and personal responsibility in the people.&quot; The speech was commonly cited by domestic and international opponents of Perón, who accused him of fascist sympathies. The junta suffered a massive decline in prestige in August 1944, as the liberation of Paris sparked massive pro-Allied demonstrations in Argentina, in which the protesters called for the resignation of the junta for its Nazi sympathies.

Perón would sharply reconfigure his views and speeches in late 1944, as the nationalist junta was facing intense pressure to reform and hold elections. He declared that his ultimate goal is to introduce &quot;true democracy&quot; in Argentina, and began searching for allies amongst the middle and upper classes. However, as he was rejected by the Radical circles, Perón committed himself to developing his popularity amongst the working class. Historian David Rock remarked that &quot;Perón again found himself forced back on the support of the unions alone and at this point openly embraced democratic socialism.&quot; He praised the victory of the Labour Party in the 1945 United Kingdom general election, portraying it as proof of &quot;humanity marching toward a new world&quot; and urged Argentinian workers &quot;to defend their rights for themselves if these rights were not to be taken away by their enemies.&quot; Perón also embraced the hitherto derogatory connotation of his supporters as &quot;shirtless&quot; (&quot;descamisado&quot;), which became a metaphor for poor and destitute worker that Peronism would lead towards a &quot;national liberation&quot;.

Using the term &quot;justicalismo&quot; to describe his ideology, Perón propagated it as &quot;socialismo nacional cristiano&quot; - &quot;Christian national socialism&quot;, an unclear term that he used to discuss diverse government systems that in his belief corresponded to the will of the people while also considering the unique circumstances and culture of each nation. According to Richard Gillespie, this expression meant to convey &quot;a ‘national’ road to socialism, understood as a system of economic socialization and popular power respectful of specific national conditions and traditions.&quot; In 1967, Perón defended his notion of &#x27;national socialism&#x27; by arguing that &quot;nationalism need not be at odds with socialism&quot;, given that &quot;both, in the end, far from being antagonistic, can be united with a common goal of liberation of peoples and men&quot;. In the September 1972 meeting of left-wing Peronist groups, Peronism was described as &quot;the national expression of socialism, insofar as it represents, expresses and develops in action the aspirations of the popular masses and the Argentine working class&quot;. Peronism was regarded as a form of autochthonous socialism that was to grant &quot;political and economic emancipation&quot; to the workers of Argentina. However, whether Peronism constituted a genuine socialist movement of non-Marxist nature is unclear. John J. Johnson and Kalman H. Silvert linked Peronism to Argentinian reactionary nationalism and concluded that it is a fascist movement, whereas Juan José Hernández Arregui and Jorge Abelardo Ramos considered Peronism a variant of left-wing nationalism or a &quot;revolutionary, anti-imperialist, nationalist movement&quot;. Jorge Castañeda Gutman describes Peronism as a national populist movement that &quot;undoubtedly belongs on the left of the political spectrum.&quot;

===Other assessments===
Peronism was a broad movement that encompassed several ideologies and concepts. Argentinian historian Cristian Buchrucker described it as a mixture of nationalist, populist and Christian socialist elements, while Humberto Cucchetti stated that Peronism was an accumulation of many political concepts such as &quot;nationalist socialism, trade unionist tradition, nationalisation of the middle strata, charismatic leadership, revolutionary prophetism, Third Worldism, justicialist ethics, Christian utopia, popular mobilisation and outlines of democratisation&quot;. While the movement was in the state of constant struggle between competing ideological movements between it, it never abandoned trade unions and its &quot;revolutionary rhetoric that claimed to assume directly the features of a nationalist liberation movement&quot;.

In his autobiography titled My Life: A Spoken Autobiography, Fidel Castro praised Perón as a revolutionary anti-imperialist who carried out social reforms. Castro also stated:
When Perón died in 1974, Castro declared three days of mourning and Cuban officials termed Peron&#x27;s death &quot;a blow to all Latin America&quot;. Castro noted the affinity and similarties between his ideology and Peronism, and cited Che Guevara letter&#x27;s in which Che stated that &quot;Peron was the most advanced embodiment of political and economic reform in Argentina&quot;. Loris Zanatta argues that both Castro and Perón represented &quot;a case of ‘nationalist socialism’&quot;. According to Zanatto, Castro was &quot;a full member of the same family&quot; as Perón, and that &quot;from Hugo Chávez to the Sandinista revolution, from liberation theology to radical indigenism, the chromosomes of Peronist &quot;national socialism&quot; recur in the Latin American populist tradition.&quot;

Perón was an important inspiration of Chavismo, the ideology of Hugo Chávez, who called himself &quot;a true Peronist&quot;. Eric Hershberg, director of the Center of Latin American Studies, wrote: &quot;For a number of years I&#x27;ve been struck by Chavismo as being the closest thing to Peronism that Latin America has seen in decades.&quot; Chávez&#x27;s successor, Nicolás Maduro, also stressed the ideological bond between Peronism and Chavismo. In July 2024, Maduro stated: &quot;I am a Peronist and an Evista.&quot;

Perón was also regarded positively by Mao Zedong. When visiting pro-Perón Maoist militias in Argentina, Mao reportedly stated: &quot;If I were a young Argentinian, I would be a Peronist.&quot; This quote was promoted by the Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina, who advertized their movement by stating: &quot;If Mao had been Argentine, he would have been a Peronist.&quot; Perón responded in kind, writing that &quot;Marxism is not only not in contradiction with the Peronist Movement, but complements it.&quot; Perón also argued in his speech from 12 November 1972: &quot;We must not be frightened by the word socialism&quot;. Perón stated that &quot;if he had been Chinese he would be a Maoist&quot;, and on his trip to Communist Romania he concluded that &quot;the regime in that country is similar, in many respects, to Justicialism&quot;.

Peronism was supported by Joseph Stalin due to its hostility towards the United States, and after Perón&#x27;s removal from power, the Soviet government had &quot;a certain nostalgia for the Peronist government&quot;. American historian Garrett John Roberts, who described Peronism as an &quot;ultranationalist socialist labor movement&quot; and Perón&#x27;s policies as &quot;socialist and nationalist&quot;, states that there was some affinity between Perón and Stalin, as Perón modeled his Five Year Plan on the economic plans carried out by Stalin. Socialist Yugoslavia was also said to have expressed interest and fascination with Peronism in the 1950s.

&quot;The Economist&quot; has called Peronism &quot;an alliance between trade unions and the &quot;caudillos&quot; of the backward north&quot;.

Chilean senator Ignacio Walker has criticized Peronism as having &quot;Fascistoid&quot;, &quot;authoritarian&quot; and &quot;corporative&quot; traits and a &quot;perverse logic&quot; considering this &quot;the real wall between Chile and Argentina&quot; and &quot;not the Andes&quot;.

Defenders of Peronism also describe the doctrine as populist, albeit in the sense that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Perón in esteem for his administration&#x27;s anti-imperialism and non-alignment as well as its socially progressive initiatives.

Ronaldo Munck noted that &quot;many observers even saw Perón himself as some kind of nationalist, socialist leader, if not as Argentina&#x27;s Lenin.&quot; While cautioning against idealistic interpretations of Peronism, Munck argues that ultimately Perón did not differ from Tendencia Revolucionaria in terms of economic ideology, but rather mass mobilisation, writing: &quot;The purely anti-imperialist and anti-oligarchic political programme of the Montoneros (&quot;national socialism&quot;) was not incompatible with Peron&#x27;s economic project of &quot;national reconstruction&quot;, but their power of mass mobilisation was.&quot; Writing on Peronism, Ernesto Laclau maintained that &quot;a socialist populism is not the most backward form of working class ideology but the most advanced - the moment when the working class has succeeded in condensing the ensemble of democratic ideology in a determinate social formation within its own ideology&quot;.

In his political science book &quot;Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics&quot;, Seymour Martin Lipset argued that the most distinguishable aspect of Peronism is that it is oriented towards trade unions, workers and class struggle, writing that &quot;Peronism, much like Marxist parties, has been oriented toward the poorer classes, primarily urban workers but also the more impoverished rural population.&quot; He characterized Peronism as an ideology best described as &quot;anticapitalist populist nationalism which appeals to the lower strata&quot;. Lipset also took note of a view that Peronism is a fascist movement, but argued that Peronism can only be seen as a left-wing equivalent of fascism: &quot;If Peronism is considered a variant of fascism, then it is a fascism of the left because it is based on the social strata who would otherwise turn to socialism or Communism as an outlet for their frustrations.&quot; Lipset concluded that Peronism should be seen as a &quot;form of &quot;left&quot; extremism&quot;.

In context of political dichotomy of Argentina, historian Daniel James argues that &quot;Peronism within the Peron/anti-Peron dichotomy that dominated the political and social context was per se leftist, anti-establishment and revolutionary&quot;. Similarly, James P. Brennan claims that as a movement, Peronism is ultimately a left-wing coalition that appeals to &quot;national popular&quot; tradition, writing that &quot;this hemisphere of the political spectrum would support the statement that Peronism is a forerunner of social democracy.&quot; According to political scientist Torcuato di Tella, Peronism occupies the same place as left-wing political parties in Europe. Comparing Argentinian politics to Italian one, he writes:
== Ideology ==
=== Twenty Peronist Tenets ===
From Perón&#x27;s &quot;Peronist Philosophy&quot;:
# &quot;A true democracy is that one in which the government does what the people want and defends only one interest: the people&#x27;s.&quot;
# &quot;Peronism is essentially of the common people. Any political elite is anti-people, and thus, not Peronist.&quot;
# &quot;A Peronist works for the movement. Whoever, in the name of Peronism, serves an elite or a leader, is a Peronist in name only.&quot;
# &quot;For Peronism, there is only one class of person: those who work.&quot;
# &quot;Working is a right that creates the dignity of men; and it&#x27;s a duty, because it&#x27;s fair that everyone should produce as much as they consume at the very least.&quot;
# &quot;For a good Peronist, there is nothing better than another Peronist.&quot; (In 1973, after coming back from exile, in a conciliatory attempt, and in order to lessen the division in society, Peron reformed this tenet to: &quot;For an Argentine, there is nothing better than another Argentine.&quot;)
# &quot;No Peronist should feel more than what he is, nor less than what he should be. When a Peronist feels more than what he is, he begins to turn into an oligarch.&quot;
# &quot;When it comes to political action, the scale of values of every Peronist is: Argentina first; the movement second; and thirdly, the individuals.&quot;
# &quot;Politics are not an end, but a means for the well-being of Argentina: which means happiness for our children and greatness for our nation.&quot;
# &quot;The two arms of Peronism are social justice and social help. With them, we can give a hug of justice and love to the people.&quot;
# &quot;Peronism desires national unity and not struggle. It wants heroes, not martyrs.&quot;
# &quot;Kids should be the only privileged class.&quot;
# &quot;A government without doctrine is a body without soul. That&#x27;s why Peronism has a political, economic and social doctrine: Justicialism.&quot;
# &quot;Justicialism is a new philosophy of life: simple, practical, of the common people, and profoundly Christian and humanist.&quot;
# &quot;As political doctrine, Justicialism balances the right of the individual and society.&quot;
# &quot;As an economic doctrine, Justicialism proposes a social market, putting capital to the service of the economy and the well-being of the people.&quot;
# &quot;As a social doctrine, Justicialism carries out social justice, which gives each person their rights in accordance to their social function.&quot;
# &quot;Peronism wants an Argentina socially &#x27;fair&#x27;, economically &#x27;free&#x27; and politically &#x27;sovereign&#x27;.&quot;
# &quot;We establish a centralized government, an organized State and a free people.&quot;
# &quot;In this land, the best thing we have is our people.&quot;

Peronism as an ideology had many factions and manifestations, often completely contradictory for each other; however, the political thought and policies of Juan Perón are considered to be the core of Peronism. As an ideology, Peronism had authoritarian and populist components, which was a blend of several ideologies and currents and a traditional Argentinian style of leadership (&quot;caudillismo&quot;), which featured a charismatic leader leading a broad front. Christopher Wylde defines Peronism as &quot;a form of leftist–populist nationalism, rooted in an urban working-class movement that was allied to elements of the domestic bourgeoisie as well as the military.&quot; The legitimacy of Peronism derived from trade unions who gave Perón their support, and his ideology was a reflection of demands and expectations of the Argentinian labor movement. According to historian Daniel James, the reliance of Peronism on trade unions was so strong, that in the Peronist movement, &quot;the initiative very much lay with the trade union movement; Perón was more its creature than the labor movement was his.&quot;

Peronist economic policy had three objectives which consisted of expanding public spending and giving the state the dominating role in production and distribution (economic nationalism), egalitarian distribution of national income (therefore Peronism is considered to represent syndicalism and/or non-Marxist socialism), and implementing a system of incentives and rewards that would direct economic activities towards local markets while severely limiting production for international markets (protectionism). Perón&#x27;s policies included extensive worker rights legislation and redistribution of wealth; Peronism rejected individualism in favor of communitarianism and sought a system that would reject both capitalism and liberalism in favor of an economic system that would be oriented around &quot;social equity, rather than the individual pursuit of wealth.&quot; This was combined with Peronist redefinition of citizenship, as Perón attracted and empowered groups that were previously excluded socially and economically - urban poor, immigrant communities and unionised workers. Throughout his lifetime, Peron attacked capitalism or aspects of the system.

Deriving from 1930s anti-imperialist nationalism, Peronist doctrine had three leading principles, as formulated by Perón: economic independence, political sovereignty, and social justice. Perón considered Argentina &quot;an economic colony of Great Britain&quot; and sought to liberate Argentina from both British and American influence; Perón&#x27;s foreign policy was formulated as &quot;third position&quot; and was a forerunner of thirdworldism - Perón argued that instead of looking to either Western capitalism or Soviet communism, Argentina should carve out its own path and seek alliances with like-minded nations that would reject imperialism and foreign influence in favour of absolute sovereignty. As a requirement for this sovereignty, Peronism featured extensive redistributive and nationalist policies - Perón established a central bank, nationalized foreign commerce and implement a system of free, universal education. Socially, Peronism was authoritarian, yet it also implemented free suffrage and promoted causes such as feminism, indigenous rights and emancipation of the working class. Peter Ranis wrote that &quot;paradoxically, Perón democratized Argentina in the sense of bringing the working class more fully into the political process, though his administrations often placed cultural and political restrictions on the opposition that severely compromised that democracy.&quot;

Writing on Perón and his ideology, Charles D. Ameringer argued that &quot;The rise to power of Juan Perón in 1943 was not the end of the socialist impulse in Argentina; it was the culmination&quot; and added that &quot;much of the social legislation either introduced or implemented by Perón . . . originated with the Socialist Party.&quot; Raanan Rein similarly wrote that Peronism as an ideology was nationalist populism, shaped by the Catholic social teaching as well as &quot;socialist currents of varying nuances&quot;. Rein attributed the socialist component of Peronism to policies that would give new sociocultural and political dimensions to Argentinian identity and nationalism. According to Rein, &quot;Peronism rehabilitated popular culture and gave folklore a place in Argentine culture, attempted to rewrite national history and included various ethnic minorities who, up until that point, had been relegated to the margins of the nation – as was the case for Arabs and Jews.&quot; Peronism is thus credited with creating the image of multicultural Argentina through his policies that would redistribute the wealth while also promoting the concept of Argentina as a society of &quot;multiple collective ethnic identities&quot;.

Peron described his ideology as &quot;intrinsically Argentine&quot; and a reflection of the Argentinian people. Perón&#x27;s preferred wording for his ideology was &quot;justicialism&quot;, which he used to promote social justice as the core of his ideology. He wrote: &quot;like the people, justicialism is national, social, and Christian.&quot; Peronist communitarian philosophy envisioned a society that would be an organized community, where each individual was to fulfill a social function &quot;in the service of all&quot;, and also have access to an extensive complex of faculties, each designed for a different special task, that would contribute to &#x27;individual happiness&#x27;. Establishing his populist rhetoric, Perón also defined his ideology as &quot;a new philosophy of life, simple, practical, popular, profoundly Christian, and profoundly humanistic&quot;, adding that Peronism was to be class-based, as justicialism &quot;centers its ideology and preoccupation on . . . the primacy in our country of a single class, the class of those who work.&quot; In his writings, Perón consistently emphasized that the roots of his ideology are based on Catholic doctrine as well as socialism; around the end of his second term, Perón argued: &quot;We believe that there are only two philosophies in the world that can embrace and give direction to the major ideological orientations: one is Christian philosophy, which is already 2,000 years old and has continued to sustain itself through 20 centuries; and the other is Marxist philosophy, which is the philosophy of communism... There is no other.&quot;

According to Brennan, as a populist mixture, Peronism synthesized multiple ideologies and schools of thought, which he listed as nationalism, anti-imperialism, socialism, authoritarianism, federalism and militarism. Robert Crassweller offers a different definition, arguing that &quot;Peronism may be defined roughly as an authoritarian populist movement, strongly colored by Catholic social thought, by nationalism, by organic principles of Mediterranean corporatism, and by the caudillo traditions of the Argentine Creole civilization.&quot; Other definitions include that of Donald C. Hodges, who saw Peronism as &quot;a Christian and humanist version of socialism&quot; and a &quot;peculiar brand of socialism&quot;. Peter Ranis notes that describing Peronism is made difficult by vague language of Perón as well as his constant pragmatic shifts that he took throughout his life - Perón often modified his rhetoric and promoted different movements in order to maintain his big-tent movement that apart from consisting of trade unions, included both left-wing and right-wing supporters. Nevertheless, Ranis wrote that Peronism was a &quot;worker-type populism&quot; that one can roughly describe as &quot;corporate democratic socialism&quot;, despite the authoritarian tendencies of Perón himself. Despite opportunistically declaring his opposition to Communism and even socialism, Perón nevertheless described his justicialism as &quot;national socialism&quot; (socialismo nacional) and &quot;Christian national socialism&quot; (socialismo national cristiano); to Ranis, Perón &quot;fused an indigenous socialism with Argentine nationalism through Peronism&quot;, and used Marxist rhetoric: 
Alternatively, Peronism was also denounced as fascism by some scholars - Carlos Fayt believed that Peronism was &quot;an Argentine implementation of Italian fascism&quot;. Such conclusion was also reached by Paul M. Hayes, who argued that &quot;the Peronist movement produced a form of fascism that was distinctively Latin American&quot;. This belief was particularly popular in the United States, as the American government sought to discredit Perón on the basis of his anti-Americanism, suspected communist sympathies, and neutrality during WW2. Similarly, anti-Peronists on the left such as anti-nationalist socialists also described Peronism as fascist. Some scholars, such as Lipset, tried to combine this view together with the conclusions that Peronism was a worker-based and a left-leaning movement; to this end, Lipset wrote that &quot;If Peronism is considered a variant of fascism, then it is a fascism of the left because it is based on the social strata who would otherwise turn to socialism or Communism as an outlet for their frustrations.&quot; Most scholars rejected this view - Felipe Pigna wrote that no researcher who has deeply studied Perón should consider him a fascist. Goran Petrovic Lotina and Théo Aiolfi wrote that &quot;Peronism was never a form of fascism during Juan Perón&#x27;s first presidencies (1946-55). Nor was Peronism fascistic in its subsequent incarnations over the past seventy-five years from the 1970s revolutionary leftist Montonero guerilla organization to the neoliberal centre-right presidency of Carlos Menem.&quot; Daniel James wrote that Perón &quot;took his ideas principally from social catholic, communitarian ideologues rather than from any pre-1955 fascistic theory.&quot; Robert Crassweller explains:
== Internal currents ==
Peronism as well as anti-Peronism have both spanned the entire ideological spectrum, including far-right fascism, far-left Marxism, center-left social democracy, and center-right neoliberalism. This led to both left-wing as well as right-wing Peronist regimes in Argentina, with competing wings of Peronism fighting not only anti-Peronist forces, but also each other. Early Peronism of the 1940s and 1950s was heavily based on left-wing and socialist rhetoric, with Perón largely relying on his socialist supporters and trade unions movements; Raanan Rein notes that the ideology and policies of Peronism &quot;were based largely on concepts that had been forged by the Argentine left wing in various debates since the beginning of the century and that had been expounded by people such as Justo, Dickmann, Ugarte, and Palacios.&quot; Similarly, Daniel James observed that in the Peronist movement, &quot;the initiative very much lay with the trade union movement; Perón was more its creature than the labor movement was his.&quot;

After being overthrown and exiled from Argentina in 1955, Perón shifted his rhetoric further leftwards and promoted Cuban Revolution as well as Liberation theology, which gave rise to the far-left wing of Peronism, Tendencia Revolucionaria. Born in an anti-Peronist Argentinian family, Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara visited Perón and praised Peronism as &quot;indigenous Latin American socialism with which the Cuban Revolution could side&quot;. Likewise, left-wing Catholic priests embraced Peronism, calling it an effective realization of liberation theology, and arguing that Peronism and Catholicism were united in their goals of &quot;love for the poor, for those persecuted for defending justice and for fighting against injustice&quot;. However, after Perón&#x27;s return to power in 1973, the right-wing Peronist faction started growing in strength, mainly thanks to the conflict of left-wing Peronists such as the Montoneros with powerful trade unions. Between the mid-1970s and 1990s, Peronism was then dominated by right-wing factions such as far-right Orthodox Peronism and neo-liberal Menemism under President Carlos Menem; Peronism would shift back to the left afterwards and came to be dominated by left-wing Kirchnerism, credited for being a Peronist current that &quot;returned the Peronist Justice Party to its traditional center-left stance following a long detour to center-right neoliberalism under Carlos Menem&quot;.

Despite the extreme ideological divergences amongst anti-Peronists as well as Peronists, Peronism as a general ideology is often considered left-wing populist. Historian Daniel James argues that &quot;Peronism within the Peron/anti-Peron dichotomy that dominated the political and social context was per se leftist, anti-establishment and revolutionary&quot;. Because of this, the current dominant faction of Peronism, left-wing Kirchnerism, is seen as a &quot;back-to-roots&quot; movement that reclaimed the ideology of &quot;classical Peronism&quot;. Nevertheless, the Justicialist Party is not considered left-wing as it also contains &#x27;dissident Peronists&#x27; opposed to left-wing Kirchnerism and following the marginalized right-leaning strands of Peronism instead. The core tenets of Peronism include defense of nationalism, anti-imperialism and laborism, together with political sovereignty, economic independence and social justice being the three primary pillars of the justicialist movement.

=== Neo-Peronism ===
Vandorism or neo-Peronism was the expression of Argentine trade unionism, which conceived of itself as a trade union party, a factor of power, a force of its own that came to claim for itself the political representation of Peronism and assumed Peronism &quot;without Perón&quot;, during the Peronist resistance since 1955. It was promoted mainly by the center-right party Unión Popular. Neo-Peronism lacked a coherent ideology and represented the pragmatic, &quot;realpolitik&quot; stance of Vandor and the trade unions&#x27; bureaucracy, as Vandor was convinced that Perón&#x27;s return to Argentina is impossible and objected to Perón&#x27;s endorsement of the left-wing, revolutionary wings of Peronism. Neo-Peronism was a conciliatory tendency that sought to integrate Peronist trade unions (or at least their leadership) into the Argentinian status quo and seek an agreement with anti-Peronist governments. After announcing &quot;Peronism without Perón&quot; in 1965, Vandor envisioned consolidating his movement by transforming the Justicialist Party into a laborist one akin to the British Labour Party, arguing that his goal is &quot;to transform the [Peronist] Movement into a political party to represent the workers under the existing regime&quot;.

By trying to create a movement detached from Perón that would embrace the &#x27;post-Peronist&#x27; politics of Argentina, Neo-Peronism greatly alienated growing left-wing factions within Peronism, including revolutionaries and radicalized trade unions, which Perón exploited. After the downfall of Perón in 1955, the Argentinian working class grew increasingly heterogeneous, as the wages of workers in dynamic industrial sectors grew and the wages of workers of declining industries decreased. By 1966, unskilled metalworkers were better paid than skilled workers in most Argentinian industries, which led to the development of &quot;labour aristocracy&quot; within the labour ranks. According to Richard Gillespie, this &#x27;labour aristocracy&#x27; formed the backbone of Neo-Peronism, whereas poor workers stayed loyal to Juan Perón, allowing Perón to isolate Vandor politically by gaining the support of the trade-unionist rank and file members. Vandorists promoted the idea of &quot;business unionism&quot; that assumed collaborating with big capital, native monopolies and international corporations, while also imposing the trade-union movements on the state. This concept allowed left-wing Peronists to accuse Vandor of supporting imperialism.

Neo-Peronists attempted to take over the Justicialist Party and reorganized its leadership to be composed of a seven-member body with a pro-Vandor majority. Vandorists sought to reorganize the Peronist movement from the bottom up&quot; and for the Justicialist Party to become a &quot;democratic and solidly structured party&quot;, where Perón was to act as a mere figurehead and have no real authority. To this end, Neo-Peronism was successfully derailed by Perón, who in 1965 sent his wife Isabel to mobilize Peronist opposition to Vandor and then made overtures to Vandor&#x27;s left-wing opponents in the Peronist trade union movement. In the 1966 Argentinian Senate election, Perón won a decisive victory against Neo-Peronists by preventing Vandor-backed candidates from winning seats. According to Steven Levitsky, &quot;the election effectively destroyed the neo-Peronist project.&quot; After the 1966 military coup in Argentina shortly after the election, Perón continued encouraging revolutionary Peronists in mobilizing armed clandestine resistance against the anti-Peronist regime in Argentina. Despite losing his influence by then, Vandor was assassinated on 30 June 1969 by the Peronist guerillas of Comando Camilo Torres, a Peronist and Camilist organization that would later become the Montoneros.

=== Orthodox Peronism ===
Orthodox Peronism was the sector of Peronism that prevailed mainly (together with La Tendencia) at the end of the 60s, during the Peronist resistance, and that demanded total attachment to Perón&#x27;s presidencies. In the consolidation of Orthodoxy, it included the most intransigent sectors of Peronism and, therefore, the most reluctant to accept any type of agreement with the government. With Peron&#x27;s return to the presidency and his notable attachment to the most nationalist sectors of Peronism, it began to encompass those most reactionary sectors of the Peronist right that repudiated the sectors proclaimed revolutionary of Peronism identified as the Revolutionary Tendency. These sectors never identified themselves as the Peronist right, and claimed the title of Third Position, moving away from both the United States and the USSR. Historians mention not making the mistake of classifying them only within the political spectrum on the political right, since it also included those centrist sectors that wanted to distance themselves from Revolutionary Peronism. Orthodox Peronists ruled Argentina during the short-lived presidency of Isabel Perón between 1974 and 1976, but maintained party control after the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état. The faction suffered a massive setback after the defeat of its candidate Ítalo Luder in the 1983 Argentine general election, and lost its lingering influence to the renewal wing of Peronism in 1987 under Antonio Cafiero.

=== Revolutionary Peronism ===
Revolutionary Peronism, also known as the Peronist &quot;Revolutionary Tendency&quot; () were those sectors of Peronism, mainly young, who, influenced by the world historical moment they were going through, began to relate the essence of Peronism to the socialist revolution. Revolutionary Peronism developed after Perón&#x27;s overthrow and exile in 1955, and introduced Marxist doctrines into Peronism; because the Peronist movement perceived itself as a revolutionary force, its ban in Argentina allowed Peronist intellectuals to rekindle the Peronist promise of revolutionary social economic transformation and national liberation.

The movement was mainly based on the writings and ideology of John William Cooke, whom in 1956 Perón gave the mandate to command all organized Peronist forces in Argentina and to take full control of the movement in case of his death. Using his position as de facto leader of Peronism during Perón&#x27;s absence, Cooke promoted revolutionary goals and presented Peronism as a movement that was &quot;antibureaucratic, socialist, profoundly national, and sister to all the world&#x27;s exploited [peoples]&quot;, and praising Perón as the &quot;leader of national liberation&quot;. In 1960, Cooke moved to Revolutionary Cuba, where he combined Peronism with Guevarism, Castroism and the foco theory.

Perón himself also endorsed embracing Marxism and identified Peronist struggle with the Cuban Revolution, further giving the movement legitimacy. He endorsed revolutionary Peronist groups such as the Montoneros and supported their struggle as a realisation of his justicialist doctrine, agreeing with the Montoneros&#x27; conclusion that &quot;the only possible road for the people to seize power and install national socialism is total, national, and prolonged revolutionary war . . . [following] the methods of rural and urban guerrillas.&quot; In addition, he allied himself with left-wing Peronist Andres Framini against the more conservative Augusto Vandor, who promoted &quot;Peronism without Perón&quot;. Following Vatican II that led to development of anti-capitalist, revolutionary and Marxist-aligned rhetoric amongst Latin American clergy, Perón also gained support of left-wing Catholics who supported the far-left liberation theology. Left-wing priests praised Peronism as a precursor to liberation theology, and the Movement of Priests for the Third World argued that &quot;the Peronist movement, revolutionary, with its massive force... will necessarily lead to the revolution which will make possible an original and Latin American socialism.&quot; 
Revolutionary Peronism was of great relevance during the Peronist resistance and the violent decades of the 60s and 70s. Beginning in 1969, Revolutionary Peronists were responsible for a wave of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations that rocked Argentina. Revolutionary violence by Peronist guerilla groups caused massive public unrest and opposition to the anti-Peronist regime, and Peronist fighters were met with a sympathetic response among the population. This faction is thus credited with the downfall of the anti-Peronist government and the return of Perón to power in 1973. This area of Peronism is mainly classified as left or extreme left in the political spectrum, due to its large presence in the guerrilla sphere. The Tendency was mainly at odds with the Peronist Right and the Peronist Orthodoxy.

=== Renovation Peronism ===
The Peronist Renovation emerged as an internal current in Peronism after the electoral defeat of 1983. It was formally constituted in 1985 by publishing its foundational manifesto signed by its national leaders: Antonio Cafiero, Carlos Grosso and Carlos Menem. Therefore, it constituted those Peronists who wanted to distance themselves from the process witnessed during the seventies with Peronist orthodoxy and the revolutionary tendency. Ideologically, it articulated the national-popular values of Peronism with liberal democracy values, such as the rule of law, deliberation and representative democracy. At the same time, it brought together sectors from the center and the right-wing.

=== Menemism ===
Menemism is a term that designates the configuration of discursive and symbolic elements that accompanied the actions of the governments of Carlos Saúl Menem as head president of the Argentine Republic during the years 1989–1999. Menem broke with the protectionist and anti-capitalist Peronist orthodoxy in favor of sharply neoliberal policies, including curtailing social spending, privatization, liberalizing trade and tying Argentinian currency to the US dollar. It is also used to designate that ideological movement around his figure, whose neoliberal ideology is described as center-right or right-wing.

=== Federal Peronism ===
Federal Peronism, also called dissident Peronism, is that non-Kirchnerist or anti-Kirchnerist Peronism that emerges as an alternative to it. It is a space that covers various sectors of right or center Peronism. Federal Peronism lacks a coherent ideology and fails to stand out from, Cambiemos coalition, particularly on economic grounds. Federal Peronism is overall more social conservative than Kirchnerism while still following the Peronist tenets of economic nationalism and social justice.

The movement represents first and foremost the diverse interests of state-level Peronist activists and leaders, who stay in opposition to Kirchnerism. Electorally, the goal of Federal Peronism was to prevent voters disaffected with Kirchnerism from defecting to anti-Peronist parties and present itself as a &quot;third-way&quot; candidacy that would maintain the diverse support bases of the Peronist movement. In comparison to Kirchnerism, Federal Peronism puts an emphasis on more republican and less populist values, and focuses more on regionalist and decentralist causes. It seeks to represent &quot;Peronism before Kirchnerism&quot; and promotes Peronist features that the movement had before being &quot;re-founded&quot; by Kirchnerism, which restored Peronism to the left-wing orientation it had under Juan Perón.

Federal Peronism sought to define itself as and represent the &quot;Peronism before Kirchnerism&quot;, and thus constitute a return to perceived original Peronist values of the 1990s. In contrast to Kirchnerism, Federal Peronism emphasized popular conservatism and promoted neoliberal, pro-business policies that were meant to &quot;create jobs&quot;; socially, the Federal Peronism emphasizes crime and the theme of law and order. Unlike Peronism itself, Federal Peronism relied on middle-class support rather than labour.

The Federal faction of Peronism was largely rebuked in the 2011 Argentine general election, and has lost control of the Justicialist Party ever since. The Peronist movement shifted further to the left under the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Political scientist Pierre Ostiguy noted that while the Kirchnerism of Cristina Kirchner that has since dominated the Peronist movement is not &quot;particularly Peronist&quot;, it is &quot;clearly leftist&quot; and could be seen as the Peronist movement aliging itself closer to the conventional left.

=== Kirchnerism ===
Kirchnerism is a center-left political movement centered around the governments of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. In 2019, Kirchnerism won the vice presidency of the Nation with Cristina Kirchner herself and with the sectors of federal Peronism, Alberto Fernández as president. In international politics they usually describe it as a movement of the political left.

== Perón&#x27;s policies ==
===Socialism, nationalism, and populism===
Perón&#x27;s ideas were widely embraced by a variety of different groups in Argentina across the political spectrum. During his rule, Perón followed populist policies with an emphasis on social justice, and implemented what was described as &quot;a combination of socialist and corporatist ideas with a strong nationalist accent.&quot; Some of Perón&#x27;s personal views later became a burden on the ideology, such as his anti-clericalism, which did not strike a sympathetic chord with upper-class Argentinians. Peronism underwent a transformation in popular perception, as initially much of the left condemned it as a fascist or an otherwise totalitarian and demagogic ideology - later many came to see it as progressive given its anti-imperialist and anti-oligarchic orientation. Emilio Ocampo noted that Peronism &quot;incorporated revolutionary Marxist elements and rhetoric, always appealing to a strong nationalist sentiment.&quot; Rafael di Tella argues that Peronism combined elements of political Catholicism with socialism, which appealed to the Argentine working class and placed Perón &quot;on the left side of the political spectrum&quot; in regards to his views and rhetoric. Federico Finchelstein states that Perón&#x27;s ideology should be seen as &quot;the synthesis of nationalism and non-Marxist Christian socialism&quot;.

Peronism is widely regarded as a form of Third World socialism, or a distinctly Argentinian kind of a populist, non-Marxist socialism akin to African socialism and Arab socialism. Perón&#x27;s public speeches were consistently nationalist and populist. German political scientist Lisa Bogerts considers Peronism a &quot;broader historical movement of communism and socialism&quot;, representing a movement different from the mainstream socialist movements in Argentina such as the Argentine Socialist Party.

Some have classified Peronism as a form of corporatism or corporate nationalism, arguing that by nationalizing Argentina&#x27;s large corporations and several industries, Perón blurred the distinctions between corporations and government. At the same time, the state largely assumed the role of negotiator between conflicting interests between labor unions and employers, though Peronism heavily favored trade unions at the expense of business interests. Louis Proyect argues that Perón &quot;embarked on a strongly leftist and pro-labor path&quot; and &quot;challenged all the old dominant classes in Argentina and promoted the class interests of the workers. However, Robert J. Alexander argues that Peronism was not corporatism, and notes that Perón &quot;argued, among other things, that Mussolini had erred in trying to impose a corporative state structure on Italian society, an attempt which Peron saw as having been a failure.&quot;

Donald C. Hodges described Peronism as a &quot;peculiar brand of socialism&quot; that heavily incorporated elements of nationalism and Christian social teaching. Main sources of inspiration for Perón and his policies were the Italian fascism of Mussolini, British laborism and the American New Deal. However, Peronists would avoid the socialist label because the Socialist Party of Argentina was considered a part of the Infamous Decade establishment, and because atheist tenets of socialism would alienate the working-class supporters of Perón. This prompted the movement to use the label of &quot;justicialism&quot; instead. Nevertheless, Hodges argues that despite its eccentric character, Peronism was a &quot;Christian and humanist version of socialism&quot; that aimed to develop a syndicalist state. Perón did express sympathy towards socialism in his speeches, stating: &quot;I have not the least doubt that in the twenty-first century the world will be socialist. . . whether it is called populism, socialism, or justicialism.&quot;

Trade union membership drastically increased under Perón, and amounted to 42% of Argentinian workforce by the time Perón was removed from office - a record in Latin America. Social justice, the main slogan of Peronism, was realized through redistributive policies, which allowed real wages to increase by 25% between 1943 and 1948, while the share of wages and salaries in the national income rose to 50% in 1950. Peronist regime would also introduce a radical reform of workers&#x27; rights - Perón implemented paid annual holidays and paid sick leave, established state-paid redundancy and dismissal compensation and workplace accident compensation. One of the most famous Peronist reforms was the &quot;aguinaldo&quot;, thirteenth-month bonus to salary which Perón described as his &quot;Christmas present&quot; for the workers.

The main and most distinctive element of Peronist economy was the &quot;Social Pact&quot;. Perón aimed to turn Argentina into a syndicalist state that would eventually establish &quot;socialism of the non-Marxist variety&quot; as the core of its economy. Peronist &quot;Social Pact&quot; was a system of collective agreements between labour and capital, with the state acting as intermediary to establish an &quot;equilibrium&quot; between the two forces. Argentinian labor gradually increased its share of the national income, reaching 50% by 1955. Justicialism also assumed gradual introduction of organized labour into state legislature, which Perón implemented on a regional scale as an experiment - Chaco received a syndicalist constitution under which half of the state legislature was to be chosen by the provincial electorate of the General Confederation of Labour. Describing Perón&#x27;s syndicalism, Hodges wrote: &quot;This was a far cry from Fascist versions of the syndicalist state as representing both owners&#x27; associations and the trade unions. With functional representation limited to trade unions, Peron&#x27;s democratic recasting of national syndicalism favored organized labor.&quot;

Peronism also lacked a strong interest in matters of foreign policy other than the belief that the political and economic influences of other nations should be kept out of Argentina—he was somewhat isolationist. Early in his presidency, Perón envisioned Argentina&#x27;s role as a model for other countries in Latin America and proposed economical unions with the countries of this region, which was expressed with his phrase: &quot;The 2000s will find us unionized or dominated&quot;, but such ideas were ultimately abandoned. Perón would also align himself with socialist states such as Castro&#x27;s Cuba and Allende&#x27;s Chile. In his 1972 &quot;Actualization politica y docthnaha para la toma del poder&quot;, Perón included &quot;perhaps the most revolutionary guidelines ever issued in his name&quot;, advising his supporters to reject Soviet communism while accepting Fidel Castro and Mao Tse-tung as fellow allies against American imperialism.

Already in his first and second presidency, Perón maintained close relations with the Soviet Union, despite his superficially anti-communist rhetoric. Soviet authorities considered Perón an ally in their struggle against the US. argued that &quot;Perón, with his own ambitions and hostility to the United States, is Stalin&#x27;s logical choice&quot;. Following Perón&#x27;s removal from power in 1955, &quot;Soviet diplomats revelead a certain nostalgia for the Peronist government&quot;.

=== Attitudes towards Indigenous peoples ===
By the time Perón came to power for the first time, there were around 129,000 American Indians in Argentina, amounting to around 0.8% of the total population. Despite their small numbers, American Indians played a significant role in the populist rhetoric of Perónism. Perón presented himself as the champion of the working class and introduced a new kind of populist politics to Argentina that would heavily influence popular actions and the worker movement. Peronist rhetoric focused on the cult of the &quot;common man&quot; and vilified anti-Peronist groups which were portrayed as the establishment. Peronist appeal was successfully amplified by Eva Perón, whose fond and passionate speeches attracted the most marginalized parts of the Argentinian society.

Peronist rhetoric had significant appeal to &quot;Argentinians&quot; of non-Argentinian ancestry, and Perón legally recategorized them as equivalent 
to native Argentinians and attempted to reorganize the state institutions responsible for their welfare. Embracing both the Peronist rhetoric and principles of populism, American Indian supporters of Peronism became known as the &quot;caciques&quot;, and inspired both political engagement and trust in state institutions amongst fellow American Indians. Because of this, Peronism made national politics relevant to the non-Argentinian communities of Argenitina for the first time and helped integrate them into the previously disinterested Argentinian nation state. Mapuche leader Jeronimo Maliqueo described American Indian peoples as &quot;the first Peronists&quot;, with Perón turning a previously invisible group of Argentinian society into active political actors.

Given a near-total lack of national visibility of American Indian communities in Argentina before 1943, Perón&#x27;s eagerness to make direct overtures to non-Argentinians was revolutionary to 1940s Argentinian politics. Peron and Evita were frequently photographed alongside them, and Perón&#x27;s second five-year plan from 1952 included a direct reference to them: &quot;The indigenous population will be protected through the direct action of the state, via their progressive incorporation into the rhythms and [living] standards of general national life.&quot; According to government minister of Argentina, while the Indian population was extremely small, pro-Indian policies were included in Peronist plan because non-Argentinians had &quot;always merited the affectionate concern of our President.&quot; Perón also designed 19 April as an international day of commemoration for non-Argentinian peoples.

The most important concession to the Amerindian community made by Peronism was its reform of the 1949 Constitution, which gave them legal status equivalent to the native Argentinian population by removing the document&#x27;s references to &quot;racial differences&quot; between Indians and Argentinians. A Peronist legislator from Tucuman that took part in the rewriting of the constitution stated that non-Argentinian peoples &quot;are as Argentine as we are ...I have seen them cheer for the country and for
[the president] . . . in whom they have placed all their hopes for social redemption.&quot; As the result, American Indians were able to receive military enrollment and citizenship papers for the first time, and were given voting rights under Perón. Seeking to utilize support for Perón amongst the non-Argentinian communities, Peronist activists would organize registration campaigns amongst them. Anthropologist Claudia Briones recalled that during her visit to a Mapuche village, one of her interlocutors remarked: &quot;Peron made us people! He gave us documents.&quot;

According to Christine Mathias, &quot;Perón enjoyed far more widespread popularity among indigenous people than any other Argentine leader&quot;. In 1943, Perón created labor ministry &quot;Secretario de Trabajo y Prevision&quot;, which was to oversee Indian affairs and reservations; a decree from 1945 declared that &quot;the state&#x27;s actions to protect indigenous populations have been characterized by narrowness and ineffectiveness, principally because they were never designated sufficient and lasting facilities or resources.&quot; In 1946 Perón then founded Direccion de Proteccion del Aborigen (DPA), with Mapuche leader Jeronimo Maliqueo becoming the director of the organization. Malique very frequently visited American Indian communities in Argentina, pledging: &quot;As the Indian I am, I will never abandon the cause of the Indians. I will continue to be a nuisance no matter who is in power.&quot; Malique&#x27;s appointment reinvigorated Indian communities across Argentina. Toba leader Pablo Machado stated that the news had left all of the Toba-Qom people &quot;with their hearts full of joy&quot;.

Efe Can Gürcan argues that the left-wing populist rule of Perón marked a &quot;historical break with Argentina&#x27;s tradition of indigenous repression, thanks to Perón&#x27;s granting of citizenship and labor rights to indigenous communities&quot;. Perón&#x27;s support for the &quot;indigenous&quot; cause as well as his reforms that considerably improved the legal and socioeconomic situation of Native American peoples in Argentina produced an environment that allow the national indigenous movement to emerge. The indigenous movement in Argentina would remain aligned with Peronism between 1955 and 1980, especially in the face of the political repression and rollback of Peronist reforms by the anti-Peronist military governments.

=== Attitudes towards Jews ===

Argentina has had the largest Jewish population in Latin America since before Perón came to power. After becoming president, he invited members of the Jewish community to participate in his government. One of his advisors was José Ber Gelbard, a Jewish man from Poland. Peronism did not have an antisemitic bias. The Jewish Virtual Library writes that while Juan Perón had sympathized with the Axis powers, Perón also expressed sympathy for Jewish rights and established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949. Since then, more than 45,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from Argentina&quot;.

Shortly after coming to power, Perón faced accusations of antisemitism from both his domestic opponents as well as the United States. Jeffrey K. Marder remarks that anti-Peronists &quot;distorted the facts, hastily and erroneously characterizing Perón as an antisemite&quot;, while the United States Department of State portrayed Peronism as a &quot;Nazi menace&quot;, publishing the &quot;Blue Book&quot; in 1946. However, most foreign observers started changing their view on Perón by late 1940s and early 1950s - in his 1953 book &quot;Peron&#x27;s Argentina&quot;, American historian George I. Blanksten criticized Perón but credited him with disavowal of antisemitism. Likewise, the American Jewish Year Book reports from 1949 and 1950 delineated problems faced by the Jewish community in Argentina, but found little fault in Perón and his regime. Perón maintained cordial relations with Jewish groups and his interaction with the Jewish community mostly consisted of exchanging favors.

Perón&#x27;s movement was mainly based on industrial workers and the labor movement, which became the very foundation of his support base. However, Perón also attempted to appeal to marginalized and outsider groups of Argentinian society, which included numerous ethnic and immigrant communities. Argentinian Jews had significant influence on socialist and communist parties and trade unions, but stayed on the margins of Argentine social and political life, facing both discrimination and assimilationist policies of the 1930s liberal government. Perón sought to recruit the Jewish community into his Peronist support base as to broaden the support for his &quot;New Argentina&quot; and also dispel the accusations of fascism.

In 1947, Perón founded &quot;Organización Israelita Argentina&quot; (OIA), the Jewish wing of the Peronist Party, in attempt to promote his ideology amongst the Jewish community. While OIA failed to attract much support of Argentinian Jews, it became an intermediary between Perón and the Jewish community. Argentinian Jews entered dialogue with Perón through IOA, securing favors and concessions. Jewish newspapers in Argentina particularly praised the socialist nature of Perón&#x27;s planned economy, leading to limited expressions of support. Peronism allowed the Jewish community to actively participate in the political life of Argentina; Jewish writer Isaías Lerner remarked: &quot;The triumph of Perón meant a greater participation of the [Jewish] community in the political arena. For the first time in Argentina&#x27;s political history, a political party courted our community.&quot;

In the book &quot;Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem&quot;, author Laurence Levine, also former president of the U.S.–Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that &quot;although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Perón&#x27;s own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic&quot;.

While Perón allowed many Nazi and other WWII-era Axis criminals to take refuge in Argentina, he also attracted many Jewish immigrants. Argentina has a Jewish population of over 200,000 citizens, one of the largest in the world.

=== Nasserism ===
Peronism is often compared and paralleled with Nasserism, or considered a variety thereof. In this context, Nasserism is described as a form of populism characterized by militarism, reformism and challenge to the status quo. &#x27;Nasserite&#x27; populism finds its support in trade unions and the lower classes, and positions itself as a &quot;social-revolutionary party&quot; that unites itself not around an ideology, but a charismatic leader. Donald C. Hodges argues that Nasserism and Peronism are so similar that they became interchangeable when referring to the distinct type of populism both movements represented, writing: &quot;The terms &quot;Nasserism&quot; and &quot;Peronism&quot; are interchangeable when applied to the younger generation of left-wing officers in Latin America.&quot; Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party, a Trotskyist political party in Mexico, stated that both Perón and Nasser were an embodiment of Bonapartism, arguing that both movements represented what Leon Trotsky described as &quot;those special governments that rely on the workers&#x27; movement, looking for a broader base in order to resist the excessive demands of imperialism.&quot;

According to Lily Pearl Balloffet, the connection between Nasserism and Peronism was not a mere coincidence, arguing that the Nasserist movement was inspired by Perón and actively engaged in translation projects to make the Peronist doctrine accessible and familiar to Arabic-speaking audiences. In 1953, Lebanese-Argentinian journalist Nagib Baaclini published an article named &quot;Egypt Has Her Own Perón Now&quot;, in which he discussed both the ideological and political closeness of both regimes. When interviewed on the parallels between Perón and Nasser, a functionary of the Egyptian Legation, Ahmed Mattar, replied: &quot;Naguib? … He is the Perón of Egypt! You Argentines can understand Naguib perfectly, because you have had to fight doggedly, as we have, for your liberty, and you have achieved [this] thanks to your magnificent leader, who is similar to Naguib.&quot; Key common features of both regimes observed by the contemporary press were anti-imperialist nationalism, the &#x27;Third Position&#x27; philosophy of non-alignment in the Cold War and &quot;socialist&quot; economic policies.

The &quot;Third Position&quot; espoused by Perón as well as Nasser is seen as the most important ideological feature of both regimes. In foreign policy, the &quot;Third Position&quot; meant that both Argentina and Egypt would follow a path of development that rejected American and Soviet imperialism in favor of a non-aligned, anti-imperialist stance. Economically, too, Perón and Nasser emphasized the need to pursue a different policy from that of American capitalism and Soviet communism - a non-Marxist socialism, which for Perón was a &quot;national socialism&quot; (or justicalism) and for Nasser an Arab socialism. The agrarian socialism of the Narodniks, the justicalism of Perón, the Arab socialism of Nasser and the &quot;Third Universal Theory&quot; of Gaddafi together form a group of &quot;Third Position&quot; economic policies. Political scientist Torcuato di Tella notes that apart from similar ideologies and policies, Nasserism and Peronism emerged in nearly identical socioeconomic conditions - both movements were able to come in power thanks to the large presence of reform-minded middle-ranking and low-ranking military officers. Di Tella refers to both regimes as representing &quot;military socialism&quot;, along with the Brazilian Tenentism, 1968 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état and the Bolivian Socialist Revolution of 1936.

Political scientists Elie Podeh and Onn Winckler note that analyzing Nasserism will naturally &quot;rely on insights derived from Latin American models, especially Peronism&quot;, arguing that both movements are exemplary of Third World populism. They also note that both regimes have similarities that go beyond populism - as their revolutionary and anti-imperialist ideology went beyond rhetoric and was translated into policies and profound changes in the societies of Argentina and Egypt, Peronism and Nasserism are credited with introducing egalitarianism to erstwhile inequal societies full of marginalized groups; they write: &quot;As was the case in Argentina under Perón, the message of the [Nasserist] regime was clear: In the revolutionary era, talent, rather than social position, determined one&#x27;s standing. Equal opportunities were open to all.&quot; Samir Amin likewise noted the &#x27;progressive&#x27; character of both movements. On Nasser, he wrote: &quot;Nasserism then achieved what it could: a resolutely anti-imperialist international posture and progressive social reforms.&quot; Similarly, Amin remarked on Perón: &quot;Perónist populism was anti-imperialist and progressive in its own way. The excesses of language and manners by the general and his wife, Eva, should not take anything away from the positive measures made in favor of workers.&quot;

Reinhard C. Heinisch described Nasserism and Peronism as egalitarian and anti-imperialist, arguing that despite transcending conventional ideological boundaries, both movements had a discernible, similar ideology. Podeh and Winckler argue that Nasserism can be seen as an independent ideology and movement because it went beyond Egypt and affected the political development of the Arab World as the whole, while &quot;Peronism and other forms of populism in Latin America have not radiated beyond state borders&quot;. However, Jean Bernadette Grugel notes that Peronism did have impact in the rest of Latin America - Víctor Paz Estenssoro and the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement of Bolivia identified with Peronism, and Carlos Ibáñez del Campo of Chile openly identified with Peronism. Feminist María de la Cruz, the campaign manager of Ibáñez, proclaimed:

Peronism and its success also led Latin American socialist to reevaluate their stance towards populism - just like socialists of Argentina broke ranks to support Peronism as a form of anti-imperialism and socialism, Ibáñez was also seen as a movement worthy of support. Grugel wrote: Alejandro Chelen testified to the fact that admiration for Peronism contributed to the Socialists&#x27; decision to support Ibáñez: &#x27;The echoes of Argentine Peronism, very much in fashion then, infected the atmosphere.&#x27;&quot; Grugel notes that &quot;Justicialismo, Titoism, Nasserism, Maoism and Castroism served as an example for the &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; socialists of the 1960s&quot;. Workers Vanguard of the American Spartacist League also highlighted Peronism and Nasserism as dominating examples of &quot;populist nationalism with a socialist coloration&quot;.

=== Relation to Catholicism ===
The ideology of Perón is considered to have been influenced by Catholic social teaching and to be a mixture of many political currents, one of them being social Catholicism. Peronism had a corporatist tendency that was rooted in social and political philosophy of the Catholic Church, with its origins in 19th-century Christian socialism and papal encyclicals of Popes Leo XII and Pius XI; this was a common denominator for other left-wing populist movements in the region, such as the one in Mexico and Peru. Peronism borrowed heavily from Catholic motifs, promising a harmonous society free of class conflict and describing its demand for social justice as the need to &quot;humanize the capital&quot; and to &quot;counter a heartless and godless pecuniary capitalism&quot;. Perón himself described his ideology of justicalismo as a &quot;unifying Christian movement&quot;, and according to Michael Goebel, Perón rhetoric &quot;had its pedigree in the ideas of social Catholicism&quot;. Perón also used Catholic rhetoric to downplay the perceived socialist nature of his ideology, given that Argentinian socialism was unpopular amongst Peronist constituency because of its militant atheism; Hodges concludes that &quot;Perón&#x27;s peculiar brand of socialism played down the socialist label in favor of its national and Christian sources&quot;.

Initially, Perón had excellent relations with the Church - the Catholic Church recognized the 1943 coup and had cordial relations with the military junta, and Perón inherited cordial relations with the clergy, who placed great hopes in the new regime. The junta gained the support of the Church thanks to its decree from 31 December 1943, which introduced compulsory Catholic religious instruction in all public schools, and created the Department of Religious Instruction for the purpose of regulating religious education. Local Catholic hierarchy overwhelmingly favored Perón in the 1946 election, praising him for his focus on social welfare and referring to papal encyclicals. Argentine bishops issued a pastoral letter instructing Catholics to not vote for any part that advocated for a separation of Church and state, which was a direct blow at political opponents of Perón. The Catholic Church had also gained profound influence on Argentinian society after World War I given the decline of militant secularism that once permeated the upper and middle classes of Argentina. Because of this, &quot;the Church was now recognised as a much-needed partner in any political project.&quot;

The relations between the Church and Perón turned sour around 1949, as Perón attacked the part of the clergy for being &quot;a bastion of extravagance and display&quot; that conflicted with the cult of simplicity that Peronism promoted. Perón argued that a &quot;socially just&quot; Argentina must reject lavishness in favour of &quot;religion of humility&quot; and &quot;the religion of the poor, of those who feel hunger and thirst for justice.&quot; In 1952, the Church attacked Perón for allowing the screening of defamatory films in Buenos Aires, along with the introduction of gradual restrictions on religious education in schools. The rift between Peronist government and the Catholic clergy became especially visible in August 1952, when the death of Eva Perón was virtually ignored by the Church. In 1953, a part of Argentinian clergy became &quot;worker-priests&quot; in style of the movement popular amongst French priests at the time - worker-priests took blue-collar jobs in mines and factories to challenge communist dominance of labour unions in favour of promoting Christian socialism. Perón feared that Argentine worker-priests could also try to infiltrate Peronist trade unions this way, and the ambition amongst some Catholic circles to politically challenge Perón was confirmed in 1954, following the attempt to create a new Christian Democratic party that year.

By 1953, the relations with the Church became openly hostile, and Peronist legislation legalizing divorce and temporarily decriminializing prostitution further alienated the clergy. In 1954, Perón accused members of the clergy of organizing a conspiracy against the government, although he highlighted &quot;that they were in no way representative of the Church in Argentina&quot;. Perón continued to attack what he described as &quot;materialistic section of the clergy&quot;, and two Italian prelates were expelled from Argentina. Between 1954 and 1955, the government imprisoned several priests for short periods of time, accusing them of political meddling or infiltration of the state trade unions, and Peronist militias clamped down on Catholic processions and organizations. The tension between the Church and Perón culminated in his excommunication in 1955, which is considered to have directly caused military coup against him that year. David Rock argued that &quot;Perón&#x27;s regime finally collapsed when it turned against the church.&quot;

Perón gradually improved his relations with the Church when in exile. In 1961, the Church allowed Perón to marry Isabel Perón despite his excommunication, and in 1963 he formally petitioned Pope John XXIII for pardon, which the Pope granted; the news of Perón&#x27;s pardon did not become aware in Argentina until 1971. Perón would be greatly influenced by the Church during his exile, and was particularly fascinated by the progressive reforms introduced in Vatican II. He built bridges with left-wing Latin American clergy, who came to perceive Peronism as the political expression of the option for the poor. Peronism became seen as precursor of liberation theology, and Perón openly embraced liberation theology in his writings. Left-wing Argentinian priests founded the Movement of Priests for the Third World, who argued that &quot;the Peronist movement, revolutionary, with its massive force, … will necessarily lead to the revolution which will make possible an original and Latin American socialism.&quot; Perón also abandoned the term of &quot;justicalismo&quot; and instead described his ideology as &quot;national socialism&quot;, which biographer Jill Hedges described as &quot;an autochthonous form of socialism as opposed to international Marxism, not Nazism&quot;. Peronism came to be strongly associated with progressive and left-wing clergy in Argentina; Brazilian promotor of liberation theology Leonardo Boff described Pope Francis as a Peronist during his visit to Argentina in 2013, remarking that the Pope was &quot;clearly defining that the enemy of the peoples is capitalism, and to say that he must have great courage: he has to be Argentine, he has to be a Jesuit and he has to be a Peronist.&quot;

The fusion of liberation theology with Peronism in Argentina was credited with the rise of the far-left Peronist organization Montoneros. Leaders of Montoneros such as Mario Firmenich and Roberto Perdía were Catholic nationalists who belonged to the Catholic Action, and encountered Peronist priests such as Carlos Mugica there. David Copello argues that &quot;in their case, religion paved the way towards Peronism&quot;, who embraced both the Christian socialism of liberation theology and nationalist socialism of Peronism. Michael Goebel argues that the formation of left-wing revolutionary organizations committed to Peronism was the result of Perón&#x27;s ideology being formed out of mainly left-wing Catholicism rather than nationalist or neo-fascist currents. Montoneros represented a radicalization of Peronism, promoting Perón&#x27;s return to Argentina as a first step towards &quot;national liberation&quot;, embracing Marxism and naming &quot;socialist fatherland&quot; as their goal. Goebel concludes that Peronism represented an &quot;anti-imperialist and third-world liberation movement more than right-wing Argentine nacionalismo.&quot; According to Richard Gillespie, &quot;through its commitment to social justice and the popular cause, radical Catholicism drew many youths towards the Peronist Movement.&quot; From there, Peronists Catholics were radicalized into Marxism with the influence of priests such as Camilo Torres Restrepo, who promoted Peronism and liberation theology as alternative to atheist communism and argued that &quot;revolution is not only permitted but is obligatory for all Christians who see in it the most effective way of making possible a greater love for all men&quot;. This resulted in the creation of various communist organizations that were &quot;committed to Peronism, socialism, and armed struggle&quot;.

=== Criticism of Perón&#x27;s policies ===
==== Authoritarianism ====
Political opponents maintain that Perón and his administration resorted to organised violence and dictatorial rule; that Perón showed contempt for any opponents, and regularly characterised them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. They also argue that Perón subverted freedoms by nationalising the broadcasting system, centralising the unions under his control and monopolising the supply of newspaper print. At times, Perón also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including Radical Civic Union leader Ricardo Balbín; and shutting down opposition papers, such as &quot;La Prensa&quot;. In contrast, historian Alan Knight argues that while &quot;Peronist democracy&quot; fell short of modern standards for liberal democracy, it should nevertheless be seen as democraticizing in the context of Argentinian history:
However, most scholars argue that Peronism was never dictatorial. Crassweller wrote on Peronism: &quot;Peronism was not a dictatorship. As the American embassy stated in April 1948, &quot;. . . Peron is far from being a dictator in the sense of having absolute authority.&quot; The army concerned itself with foreign policy. Totalitarian methods frequently appeared in the operations of the police, or in repression of the press, or in restrictions imposed on the conduct of opposition, but this falls short of a dictatorship. Peron often had to bargain for support, to trim his sails on the timing of initiatives, and to balance interests that could not be overridden. Strong and authoritarian and sometimes oppressive, yes. But not really dictatorial.&quot; Paul Corner and Jie-Hyun Lim similarly argued: &quot;Peronism (like early Cold War populism as a whole) was not a dictatorship but an authoritarian form of democracy.&quot; Paola Raffaelli wrote: &quot;Although some authors suggest that Peronism was a form of fascism, this was not the case. He was democratically elected and other parties and the Parliament were not banned, it did not pursue an ideology apart from a less-dependant nation, and Perón was in power three times for ten years within a twenty-eight years period of time.&quot;

==== Fascist influences ====
Perón&#x27;s admiration for Benito Mussolini is well documented. Whether Peronism was fascist or not is heavily contested. Historian Federico Finchelstein, philosopher Donald C. Hodges and historian Daniel James argue that Perón was not fascist, while lawyer Carlos Fayt, historian Paul Hayes and political scientist Paul H. Lewis categorise Peronism as a fascist ideology, or as having been influenced by it. Carlos Fayt believed that Peronism was &quot;an Argentine implementation of Italian fascism&quot;. Alternatively, Peronism is also considered &quot;left-wing fascism&quot;. Referring to this view, Seymour Martin Lipset argued that &quot;If Peronism is considered a variant of fascism, then it is a fascism of the left because it is based on the social strata who would otherwise turn to socialism or Communism as an outlet for their frustrations.&quot; Hayes reaches the conclusion that &quot;the Peronist movement produced a form of fascism that was distinctively Latin American&quot;.

One of the most vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. After Perón ascended to the presidency in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) by saying: Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of caudillos, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking[...] Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; or &quot;Don Segundo&quot; that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.

However, most scholars believe that Peronism was not a form of fascism. Summarizing the academic consensus on the issue, Arnd Scheider wrote that &quot;most authors, analysing the phenomenon in retrospect agree that the term Fascism does not accurately describe Peronism.&quot; James P. Brennan remarked that &quot;In general, even those authors convinced of the fascist character of Peronism recognize that its predominant characteristics resemble very little those of European fascism.&quot; Argentine historian Cristian Buchrucker outlines main reasons why Peronism cannot be characterized as fascism:
* Peronism developed in the early and mid 1940s during a period of economic growth - unlike Italian Fascism and German Nazism, which developed at a time of economic crisis;
* when Perón became Labour Secretary in 1943 and started to implement the first elements of his ideology, it did not mark the end of democracy (as in 1922&#x27;s Italy and 1933&#x27;s Germany). Rather, Perón succeeded the Infamous Decade, which had already seen prolonged military rule and authoritarian conservative governments, &quot;thinly legitimized by fraudulent elections&quot;;
* Peronism was based primarily on the urban and urbanized rural working class. In contrast, the appeal of Italian Fascism and German Nazism was to the middle classes who were disillusioned with a lost World War I and economic crisis;
* while the societies of Italy, Germany and Argentina all perceived a threat of communism, only Italy and Germany had strong left-wing movements; Argentina lacked a strong left-wing movement, as socialist parties &quot;had long been suppressed and ceased to play any tangible role&quot;, and &quot;the working class, and the new urban poor, were without a real organizational voice&quot; before Perón;
* the virulent, fascist territorial expansionism of Italy and Germany was absent in Peronism;
* unlike fascism, Peronism was an authoritarian, not a totalitarian political system, as Argentina never became a one-party state.

Donald C. Hodges remarked that it is a &quot;cheap academic trick to lump together fascism (...) and Peronism&quot;. Perón embraced the concept of the state as the juridical instrument that can only function within and serve the nation, but rejected the organic notions of the state assuming the dominating role by organizing the nation. Perón also prided himself in his doctrinal flexibility and elasticity, and agreed with national syndicalism of Primo de Rivera in principle, although he ultimately pursued a different political path. Hodges argues that &quot;In view of both its gradualism and its concern for striking a balance between extremes, justicialism has more in common with the American New Deal than with either Italian fascism or German national socialism.&quot; Daniel James believes that the neo-corporatism of Peronism cannot be explained by any allegiance to fascist ideas, arguing that Perón &quot;took his ideas principally from social catholic, communitarian ideologues rather than from any pre-1955 fascistic theory.&quot; As a response to Carlos Fayt who characterized Perónism as fascist, James P. Brennan wrote:

A close study of Peronist ideology, however, shows that the differences between it and fascism are greater than their few similarities. The central components of Justicialismo — that is, of Peronist ideology — have roots in the Social Christianism and national populism of the FORJA (the yrigoyenista, the nationalist youth wing of the Radical Party in the 1930s), and in syndicalism. Moreover, this synthesis proved to be more resilient over time than many had assumed. In Peronism&#x27;s formative stage, the irrational vitalisme (&quot;life&quot; philosophy) and Social Darwinism of fascism had minimal and no influence, respectively. With regard to Italian corporatism, which ended up replacing the unions and democratic elections, it cannot be seriously compared with the syndicalist element in Peronism. Peronism&#x27;s presumedly expansionist goals likewise are nowhere in evidence, and Sebreli&#x27;s thesis does not stand up to the slightest analysis. The only similarity that can be acknowledged is the particular importance both ideologies granted to the concept of the leader.

Whereas Italian fascism and German nazism destroyed the universal suffrage that had existed in those countries, Peronism on the other hand put an end to the systematic electoral fraud that had been practiced in Argentina between 1932 and 1943. There was no militarization of society, nor was public spending directed toward a massive arms buildup. Economic policy was dirigisme, but if state, planning is an indicator of fascism, one would have to conclude that Mexico under Cardenas and Great Britain under the Labour governments were also Fascist states. The Peronist governments of 1946-1955 and 1973-1976 directed their efforts toward distributive and industrializing policies.

According to Pablo Bradbury, while there was a great divergence between formal Peronist ideology and the wider Peronist movement, the ideology of Perón was not fascist; Bradbury argues that nationalism of Peronism was not rooted in a sense of expansion or imperialist greatness, but was left-wing nationalism that &quot;found its most prominent expressions in anti-imperialism, whether against British economic dominance or US political interference.&quot; He also remarked that &quot;Peronism originated in a military dictatorship, but established a populist authoritarian democracy&quot;. The democratizing movement within Peronism was significant, as it empowered previously marginalized groups - Peronism introduced universal suffrage and reshaped the definition of Argentinian citizenship and national identity. Bradbury also points to the racist rhetoric of middle-class and upper-class opponents of Peronism, who called Peronists &quot;cabecitas negras&quot; (&quot;little black heads&quot;), portraying the Peronist masses as prone to criminality, unsophisticated, dark-skinned and of immigrant background. Michael Goebel likewise points to the inclusive character of Peronism that conflicted with the exclusive nature of fascism - non-Spanish surnames were far more prevalent amongst the Peronist leadership than among any other political movement in Argentina, and &quot;even in the more marginal
provinces, Peronist politicians often had rather recent immigrant origins.&quot; Cas Mudde stated that &quot;it is not an exaggeration to state that [Perón&#x27;s] populism in general propelled democracy forward, both by encouraging democratic behavior and by enrolling lower class groups and their quest for social justice in political life.&quot;

Goran Petrovic Lotina and Théo Aiolfi wrote that &quot;Peronism was never a form of fascism during Juan Perón&#x27;s first presidencies (1946-55). Nor was Peronism fascistic in its subsequent incarnations over the past seventy-five years from the 1970s revolutionary leftist Montonero guerilla organization to the neoliberal centre-right presidency of Carlos Menem.&quot;

==== Class consciousness ====
Marxist and socialist critics of Peronism presented the movement as fuelled by migrant, recently arrived &quot;new working class&quot; that held traditionalist social views and was vulnerable to &quot;authoritarian paternalism&quot; of Perón. In this view, Peronism disempowered the &#x27;old&#x27;, socialist-aligned and established working class in Argentina by mobilizing &quot;new arrivals&quot; who flocked to Perón &quot;without a clear consciousness of their class interests&quot;. Such view was espoused by writers such as Samuel Baily, who wrote that in Argentina, &quot;the internal migrants and the organised workers viewed each other with hostility and suspicion&quot;; according to Baily, Perón exploited this division by building his political base on &#x27;class-unconscious&#x27; migrants who felt isolated by the established working class. Post-Marxist Ernesto Laclau also supported this view, accusing Perón of preying on the &#x27;irrationality&#x27; of internal migrants and describing Peronism as &quot;left-wing fascism&quot;. Socialist writers Timothy F. Harding and Hobart A. Spalding likewise accused Peronism of preventing the rise of revolutionary and militant tendencies amongst the Argentinian working class by infusing it with &quot;false consciousness&quot;.

However, validity of this perspective has been challenged by sociologists and historians such as Ronaldo Munck or Ricardo Falcón. Analysing the demographics of Peronist support, sociologists Miguel Murmis and Juan Carlos Portantiero found that &quot;the organisations and leaders of the ‘old’ working class participated intensely in the rise of Peronism&quot; and argued that the participation of the Argentinian working class in the Peronist movement was not &quot;passive, short sighted or divided&quot;. Historian Walter Little disputed the significance of the division between &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; working class in Argentina, writing: &quot;Far from being divided, the working class was remarkably homogeneous and explanations of popular support for Peronism must be developed on this basis.&quot;

Analysing the support of the trade union movement for Peronism, Munck and Falcón wrote: &quot;Perón achieved the support of trade union leaders from the dissident socialists of the CGT No. 1, some of the major unions of the orthodox CGT No. 2, and in particular from the autonomous or independent unions, not forgetting the remnants of the syndicalist USA which had favoured this type of alliance since the 1935 split. Support from the leadership was matched by support from the rank and file.&quot; Regarding class consciousness, sociologist Susan B. Tiano wrote that in the Harvard Project, a survey of working-class attitudes in Argentina during the 1960s, Peronism was found to be &quot;a major consciousness-increasing force among Argentine workers.&quot; Likewise, Munck and Falcón conclude that &quot;Peronism can be seen as an overall consciousness-raising factor, and the ideological cement for the cohesive and solidaristic social structures of the Argentine working class.&quot;

== Peronism after Perón ==
=== Fall of Perón ===
A military and civilian coup, the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;, led by General Eduardo Lonardi, overthrew the Perón government in 1955. During the coup, Lonardi drew analogies between Perón and Juan Manuel de Rosas. Lonardi used the quote &quot;neither victors nor vanquished&quot; (), which was used by Justo José de Urquiza after deposing Rosas in the battle of Caseros. The official perspective was that Perón was &quot;the second tyranny&quot;, the first one being Rosas; and that both ones should be equally rejected and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end, they draw the line of historical continuity &quot;May – Caseros – Libertadora&quot;, matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular, so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead. Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity &quot;San Martín – Rosas – Perón&quot;.

The absence of Perón, who lived for 16 years in exile in Francoist Spain, is an important key to understanding Peronism. After he went into exile, he could be invoked by a variety of Argentine sectors opposed to the current state of affairs. In particular, the personality cult of Eva Perón was conserved by supporters while despised by the &quot;national bourgeoisie&quot;. In the 1960s, John William Cooke&#x27;s writings became an important source of left-wing revolutionary Peronism. Left-wing Peronism was represented by many organizations, from the Montoneros and the Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas to the Peronist Youth, the Frente Revolucionario Peronista and the Revolutionary Peronist Youth, passing by Peronismo en Lucha or Peronismo de Base.

On the other hand, older Peronists formed the base of the orthodox bureaucracy, represented by the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica (Augusto Vandor, famous for his 1965 slogan &quot;For a Peronism without Perón&quot; and declaring as well that &quot;to save Perón, one has to be against Perón&quot;, or José Ignacio Rucci). Another current was formed by the &quot;62 Organizaciones &#x27;De pie junto a Perón&#x27;&quot;, led by José Alonso and opposed to the right-wing Peronist unionist movement. In the early 1970s, left-wing Peronism rejected liberal democracy and political pluralism as the mask of bourgeois domination. The anti-communist right-wing Peronism also rejected it in the name of corporatism, claiming to return to a &quot;Christian and humanist, popular, national socialism&quot;.

=== Perón restored ===
By 1970, many groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum had come to support Perón, from the left-wing and Catholic Montoneros to the fascist-leaning and strongly antisemitic Tacuara Nationalist Movement, one of Argentina&#x27;s first guerrilla movements. In March 1973, Héctor José Cámpora, who had been named as Perón&#x27;s personal delegate, was elected President of Argentina, paving the way for the return of Perón from Spain. A few months after Perón&#x27;s return and the subsequent Ezeiza massacre during which the Peronist Left and Right violently clashed, new elections were held in September with Perón elected president and his third wife Isabel vice president.

José Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, had been replaced temporarily by interim President Raúl Alberto Lastiri. Though up to 1972 Perón staunchly supported Tendencia Revolucionaria embodied by Peronist youth organisations and the Montoneros, the trade union movement that was the largest Peronist faction felt marginalized, and their growing bitterness towards Perón threatened the stability of the movement. Because of this, when he became president again, Perón made significant concessions to Argentinian trade unions, which in turn &quot;threw their considerable financial and organisational resources behind Perón&quot;. This led to marginalization of the Peronist Left, who was &quot;driven into
sullen compliance or into clandestine opposition&quot;. Constant skirmishes between revolutionary Peronists and Peronist trade unions took place between 1973 and 1974 - Montoneros would assassinate trade union leaders, whereas the trade union bureaucracy used its growing power within the administration to expel hostile parts of Peronist Left, as signified by José Rucci, CGT leader, stating that ‘there will be no more messing around’. On 1 October 1973, Senator Humberto Martiarena, who was the national secretary of the Superior Council of the National Justicialist Movement, publicized a document giving directives to confront &quot;subversives, terrorist and Marxist groups&quot; which had allegedly initiated a &quot;war&quot; inside the Peronist organizations. From then on, the Superior Council took a firm grip on the Peronist organizations to expel the Left from it. Lester A. Sobel argues that in regards to his conflict with the Montoneros, &quot;Perón was less opposed to socialism than to the rifts within his movement, caused in part by antagonism between Marxists and non-Marxists&quot;.

On that same day, a meeting took place among President Raúl Lastiri, Interior Minister Benito Llambí, Social Welfare Minister José López Rega, general secretary of the Presidency José Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors, which has been alleged to have been the foundational act of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, orthodox peronist and death squad.

Perón&#x27;s health was failing throughout his third and final term, which ended abruptly with his death and the succession of his wife to the presidency on 1 July 1974, but she was ousted by the military in another &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1976, paving the way for the ensuing dictatorship&#x27;s &quot;National Reorganization Process&quot; and the subsequent &quot;Dirty War&quot; against everyone deemed subversive, especially leftists, including left-wing Peronists.

=== Menem years ===
The official Peronist party is the Justicialist Party (PJ), which was the only Peronist party for a long time. During the government of Carlos Menem, a group of legislators led by Carlos Álvarez known as the &quot;Group of 8&quot; left the party, claiming that the government was not following Peronist doctrines. They created a new party, the Broad Front.

A short time later, José Octavio Bordón left the PJ as well, fearing that he might lose a primary election against Menem and thus he created his own party to take part in the 1995 elections and allied with Álvarez&#x27; Broad Front in the Front for a Country in Solidarity (Frepaso) coalition. Similar breakaway movements followed frequently after that, creating many small parties which were led by single politicians claiming to be the authentic inheritors of Peronism.

=== Kirchnerism ===
The PJ did not participate as such during the 2003 elections. The party allowed all three precandidates to run for the general elections, using small parties created for that purpose. Néstor Kirchner won the elections running on a Front for Victory ticket. As he did not disband his party after the election, Kirchnerism relies on both the PJ and the Front for Victory.

<doc id="242380" wikidata="Q1943112" url="?curid=242380" title="Mojave National Preserve">
<text>Mojave National Preserve is a United States National Preserve located in the Mojave Desert of San Bernardino County, California, US, between Interstate 15 and Interstate 40. The preserve was established October 31, 1994, with the enactment of the California Desert Protection Act by the United States Congress, which also established Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley National Park as National Parks. Previously, some lands contained within the Preserve were the East Mojave National Scenic Area, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. At , within the contiguous United States it is the third largest unit of the National Park System and the first largest National Preserve. The preserve was created within the Pacific West Region of the National Park Service and remains within that jurisdiction today.

Natural features include the Kelso Dunes, the Marl Mountains and the Cima Dome, as well as volcanic formations such as Hole-in-the-Wall and the Cinder Cone Lava Beds. The preserve surrounds Providence Mountains State Recreation Area and Mitchell Caverns Natural Preserve, which are both managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.

Impressive Joshua tree forests are found in parts of the preserve. The forest covering Cima Dome and the adjacent Shadow Valley is the largest and densest in the world. In August 2020, a wildfire destroyed 1.3 million Joshua trees around Cima Dome. The ghost town of Kelso is found in the preserve, with the defunct railroad depot serving as the visitor center. The preserve is commonly traversed by four-wheel drive vehicles traveling on the historic Mojave Road, part of the Old Spanish National Historic Trail.

Climate in the preserve varies greatly. Summer temperatures average , with highs exceeding . Elevations in the preserve range from at Clark Mountain to near Baker. Annual precipitation varies from near Baker, to almost in the mountains. At least 25% of precipitation comes from summer thunderstorms. Snow is often found in the mountains during the winter.

==Challenges==
The preserve faces challenges based on its lack of funding, as of 2018 the preserve had a deferred maintenance of $118,036,341. This lack of funding has primarily lead to infrastructure disrepair which, in combination with the reckless driving by some visitors, has caused a significant threat to the endangered desert tortoise population within the preserve. In addition to the tortoise&#x27;s threatened population, the prairie falcon and the bighorn sheep are both at a risk within the preserve. A common solution provided to help save this population is to install wildlife crossings over the main roads within the preserve, though this is currently not possible with the funding provided.

==Mojave Wilderness==
The California Desert Protection Act of 1994 (CDPA) designated a wilderness area within Mojave National Preserve of approximately . The National Park Service manages the wilderness in accordance with the Wilderness Act, the CDPA, and other laws that protect cultural and historic sites in the wilderness.

== Administrative history ==

Upon the preserve&#x27;s establishment, Mary Martin was designated as its superintendent, she served from 1994 to 2005, when she was moved to Lassen Volcanic National Park. Dennish Schramm then served from 2005 to 2010. Stephanie Dubois served from 2010 to 2014. Todd Suess served from 2014 to 2020, though he continues to work for the National Park Service as the Chief of Biological Resources. Mike Gauthier served from 2020 to 2023, and is now superintendent at Lake Mead National Recreation Area.

== Life ==
He was born and educated in Geneva, where he earned a law degree, the license de droit, in 1751. He became tutor in the family of the count of Calenberg in Lower Saxony. In 1752 he was appointed professor of &quot;belles lettres&quot; to the academy at Copenhagen and held the position through 1760. 

He was naturally attracted to the study of the ancient literature and history of Denmark, his adopted country, and in 1755 he published the first fruits of his researches, under the title &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;histoire du Danemarck où l&#x27;on traite de la religion, des moeurs, des lois, et des usages des anciens Danois&quot;. A second part, more particularly relating to Danish literature, &quot;Monuments de la mythologie et de la poesie des Celtes, et particulierement des anciens Scandinaves&quot;, was issued in 1756, and was also translated into Danish and German. A translation into English, with notes and preface, by Bishop Thomas Percy, was issued in 1770 under the title of &quot;Northern Antiquities&quot; (republished with additions in 1847). The book had a wide circulation, and attracted much attention on account of its being the first translation into French of the Edda.

The king of Denmark showed his appreciation by choosing Mallet to be preceptor of the crown prince, a position held 1755-1760. In 1760 he returned to Geneva and became professor of history in his native city. He became a correspondent of l&#x27;Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1763 and served as a member of the Swiss Council of Two Hundred 1764–1789. While in Geneva, he was requested by the czarina Catherine the Great to undertake the education of the heir-apparent of Russia (afterwards the Czar Paul I), but declined. A more appealing invitation led to his accompanying the young Lord Mountstuart as a tutor in his Grand Tour travels through Italy, where Mallet met and clashed with James Boswell in Rome, and thence to England, where he was presented at court and commissioned to write the history of the House of Brunswick. He had previously received similar commission from the landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) for the reparation of a history of the House of Hesse, and both works were completed in 1785.

The quietness of a literary life was rudely broken by the French Revolution, to which he was openly hostile. His leanings to the unpopular side were so obnoxious to his fellow-citizens that he was obliged to quit his native country in 1792, and remained in exile till 1801. He died 8 February 1807 at Geneva.

== Works ==
A memoir of his life and writings, by Sismondi, was published at Geneva in 1807. Besides the &quot;Introduction to the History of Denmark&quot;, his principal works are:
*&quot;Histoire du Danemarch&quot; (3 vols., Copenhagen, 1758–1777)
*&quot;Histoire de la maison de Hesse&quot; (4 vols., 1767–1785)
*&quot;Histoire de la maison de Brunswick&quot; (4 vols., 1767–1785)
*&quot;Histoire de la maison et des etats du Mecklenbourg&quot; (1796)
*&quot;Histoire des Suisses ou Helvetiens&quot; (4 vols., Geneva, 1803) (mainly an abridgment of Johannes von Müller&#x27;s great history)
*&quot;Histoire de la ligue hanseatique&quot; (1805).

<doc id="242394" wikidata="Q477209" url="?curid=242394" title="Amplexus">
<text>Amplexus (Latin &quot;embrace&quot;) is a type of mating behavior exhibited by some externally fertilizing species (chiefly amphibians and horseshoe crabs) in which a male grasps a female with his front legs as part of the mating process, and at the same time or with some time delay, he fertilizes the eggs, as they are released from the female&#x27;s body. In amphibians, females may be grasped by the head, waist, or armpits, and the type of amplexus is characteristic of some taxonomic groups.

Amplexus involves direct contact between male and female, distinguished from other forms of external fertilization, such as broadcast spawning, where sperm and eggs are freely shed into water without direct contact by individuals. In order for amplexus to be initiated, male frogs must first find a mate by attracting one through calls, typically in the evening. Once a male has successfully attracted a mate, the process of amplexus begins, while the unsuccessful males are forced to continue their search for a mate through further calls.

The competition for a female mate among males is considered intense, and it is not uncommon for a male amphibian to attack an already-amplexed pair of amphibians. When a male amphibian attacks an amplexed pair of amphibians, he is trying to force the other male to release its grasp of the female, so he can then mate with her. Male amphibians are also known to show mate-guarding behaviour, which is shown after amplexus, and it is the male&#x27;s attempt to prevent the female amphibian from mating with other males.

The duration of amplexus has been found to vary across species. In some species it may last for many days, while in others it may last a few hours. Despite the variation in the duration of amplexus across species, typically all species that exhibit this behaviour have to use their forelimb muscles for the duration of amplexus. Studies have found that this reproductive behaviour of amplexus can come with different fitness costs, because amplexus can occur for prolonged periods of time. For instance, a study found that when a male amphibian is grasping and holding onto a female amphibian, this can lead to the impairment of the female&#x27;s ability to move or to feed. After conducting experiments, researchers confirmed that amplexus does decrease a female&#x27;s locomotor performance (e.g., swimming, walking) as well as the feeding rates. With regard to the cost to the male engaged in amplexus, male amphibians have been found to not feed at all during amplexus.

== Types ==
Many types of amplexus are identified in the literature. However, two types of amplexus are more common than others, known as inguinal and axillary amplexus. These two types of amplexus have been classified based on the position of the male amphibian relative to the female. When a male amphibian clasps a female around her waist (inguinal region) using his forelimbs, this is considered inguinal amplexus. By contrast, when a male amphibian clasps behind the forelimbs (axillary region) of the female, this is considered axillary amplexus.

== Physiological and hormonal function ==

=== Physiology ===
Amplexus has been found to involve different muscles in both male and female amphibians. The forelimb muscles in both males and females have been identified as the key muscles for amplexus that most species use. These forelimb muscles that are used during amplexus are typically larger in males than females, and for males these muscles contain more oxidative fibers, which could mean that amplexus involves an increased rate of aerobic metabolism. In addition to those forelimb muscles being larger in males, male frogs also typically have keratin pads or nuptial pads, which are located on their thumbs and contribute to the success of amplexus by assisting in gripping the female for the duration of amplexus. This amplexus behaviour allows the amphibians&#x27; cloacae to be in close contact, while gametes are released. Additionally, amplexus is thought to help with the alignment of the reproductive tracts of both males and females, which furthermore contributes to successful fertilization. A female amphibian may not always be receptive to a male amphibian who is trying to initiate amplexus, as the female may not be ready to produce eggs. When the female is not ready to engage in amplexus, she will simply vibrate her body, which will then be felt by the male who is clasped to her and he will then stop the amplexus behaviour.

=== Hormones ===
Two major hormones have been identified to be involved in amplexus. The hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) has been identified as having an effect on the calling behaviours produced by these male amphibians when searching for a female mate, as AVT increased the amount of calling behaviour produced in male amphibians. Additionally, it is believed that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) has an influence on amplexus in amphibians, as it has been found to produce or initiate this behaviour in many anuran amphibians. Furthermore, both arginine vasotocin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone have been found to be involved in the sexual behaviour of male amphibians. The stress hormone corticosterone has also been identified as associated with the sexual behaviour of amplexus. A study conducted on red-spotted newts found an acute increase in corticosterone for both males and females who were engaged in the behaviour of amplexus. However, overall it was found that males have a higher level of corticosterone compared to females, as amplexus is seen as more energetically costly to males. The increase in corticosterone found in females could be attributed to amplexus preventing them from foraging for food.

==Amphibians==

===Anurans===
Amplexus chiefly occurs aquatically, but some terrestrial anurans (frogs and toads) like the disc-tongued frogs (Discoglossidae) perform amplexus on land. In crown-group anurans, like the true frogs (Ranidae), the tree frogs (Hylidae), and the true toads (Bufonidae), amplexus is axillary (in the armpits). Other anurans (the Archaeobatrachia, Sooglossidae and Myobatrachidae), show the ancestral state which is inguinal or lumbar amplexus (abdominal, in front of the hindlegs). Some species show cephalic amplexus where the head of the female is held while others show complete lack of amplexus. Additionally, anurans species have been observed to engage in multiple amplexus, which can also be referred to as a mating ball, as many toads attach themselves to a female trying to initiate amplexus. However, multiple amplexus is not common among anurans, which could indicate that the costs associated with multiple amplexus are higher than the advantages associated with it. For female anurans, the idea of multiple amplexus would probably be more advantageous, because mating with more than one male would increase fertilization chances or increase offspring genetic diversity. Multiple amplexus would typically be common in explosive breeding amphibians, when there is a larger number of adults ready to breed at a breeding site in a short period of time. When this occurs female amphibians are viewed as a very important resource for males, as there are typically more males present than females, thus leading to more chances for multiple amplexus to occur.

In most anurans, the males deposit sperm onto the eggs as they are being laid, however males of the genus &quot;Ascaphus&quot; possess an intromittent organ, unique among anurans, for internal fertilization. Internal fertilization does occur in a few other genera, including &quot;Nectophrynoides&quot;, &quot;Mertensophryne&quot;, and &quot;Eleutherodactylus&quot;.

===Newts===
In the case of newts, the process of amplexus is often observed soon after the newts become seasonally active. In the Western USA, for example, this time is typically soon after the onset of the winter rainy season, when intermittent streams and vernal pools become available as a breeding habitat. The rough-skinned newt is a specific widespread example of a newt in the western USA that can be observed in quiet stream pools and shallow ponds engaging in amplexus. During amplexus in newts, males will typically show the behaviour of tail fanning and chin rubbing which is thought to prompt the mating receptivity of the female newt. Studies have shown that male newts who have deeper tail-fins have better control of females during amplexus and are also more successful in catching the females for amplexus. Additionally, it has been found that the probability of a male newt who has a deeper tail-fin to achieve amplexus is greater than those newts who do not contain a deeper tail-fin, as male newts tend to use their tails during male-male competition. When a male newt, who is unpaired, encounters a female and male newt engaged in amplexus, the unpaired newt will try to displace the paired male newt by using wrestling tactics. A study examining the wrestling behaviour of newts found that of the observed wrestling encounters, 90% were &quot;won&quot; by the paired male, meaning he would retain the female newt. The study found that the invading unpaired newt rarely successfully displaces the paired male newt, engaged in amplexus.

==Horseshoe crabs==

Amplexus occurs in all four species of horseshoe crab. Horseshoe crabs typically go ashore for amplexus in high tide, and end up on beaches where the eggs are more protected. The first pair of walking legs is used to tightly clasp the female in all species, and the second pair is also employed in all but &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;. A male horseshoe crab develops modified claspers during sexual maturity when the male moults; these modified claspers can then help during the process of amplexus. The male&#x27;s pair of posterior claspers are known for having the ability to maintain long-term amplexus which have been found to always attach to the female&#x27;s opisthosoma during amplexus. In contrast, the male&#x27;s anterior claspers have been found to attach to the female&#x27;s opisthosoma as well, but on the lateral edges of the opisthosoma and function to resist displacement from environmental factors. Uniquely, amplexus is most likely to occur between horseshoe crabs when the female horseshoe crab has a hard shell. Additionally, males who inhabit a clean shell are more likely to enter amplexus, compared to males who contain a dirty shell, as it seems that females have a preference for clean shells on males. A male horseshoe crab&#x27;s claspers may also be an important factor of consideration for the initiation of amplexus. Since claspers are used for the attachment to the female, claspers that are in good condition are more successful for the initiation of amplexus. If a male horseshoe crab has a damaged or missing clasper, then that puts the male at a disadvantage and increases the probability of being displaced by other competing male crabs.

== Other animals ==
Fossil evidence suggests that a certain euthycarcinoid (an extinct arthropod) from the Cambrian may also have mated by amplexus.

<doc id="242398" wikidata="Q842881" url="?curid=242398" title="Lake Saint Pierre">
<text>Lake Saint Pierre (, ; ) is a lake in Quebec, Canada, a widening of the Saint Lawrence River between Sorel-Tracy and Trois-Rivières. It is located downstream, and northeast, of Montreal; and upstream, and southwest, of Quebec City. The end of the lake delimits the beginning of the estuary of Saint Lawrence.

This lake which is long (excluding Sorel Islands) and wide, is part of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Including its shoreline, islands, and wetlands, the lake is a nature reserve. The body of water is recognized as a Ramsar site and as a Biosphere Reserve, due to the presence of many marshes and wetlands that are frequented by waterfowl. Recreational activities on the river (such as fishing, boating, sailing, swimming, water skiing, nature observation) are active mainly in summer season. Sport fishing is particularly popular, including ice fishing, especially in the great bay of Pointe-du-Lac.

Around Lake Saint-Pierre, several recreational services are available including marinas, hotel services, restaurants, outfitters, docks, gas stations, and cruises.

== Geography ==
Approximately 12,500 years ago, the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age resulted in a vast basin filled by the Champlain Sea. This sea extended from the city of Quebec to the east, and covered the Lower Mauricie, the Lower Laurentians, the lower part of the Ottawa Valley, Lake Ontario on the western side, and Lake Champlain USA) on the South side. The outline of the Champlain Sea is marked by ancient sandy shores where sand pits have been exploited. The water level has dropped some 8,000 years ago. The surface area of the watershed is (equivalent to more than 60% of the surface area of Quebec). 58% of the catchment area is located in the United States, 28% in Ontario and only 14% in Quebec (2.5% in direct tributaries, 0.07% in the littoral zone). Lake Saint-Pierre is linked to 11 administrative regions, 58 RCMs and 654 municipalities.

The lake is located in the Regional County Municipalities of Nicolet-Yamaska, Maskinongé, D&#x27;Autray, and Pierre-De Saurel, in addition to the city of Trois-Rivières. The shores of the lake affect several municipalities: 
* North shore: Berthierville, Maskinongé, Louiseville, Yamachiche and Trois-Rivières (Pointe-du-Lac sector)
* South shore: Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel, Pierreville, Baie-du-Febvre and Nicolet.

Lake Saint-Pierre is fed by the St. Lawrence River (coming from the southwest) and the 14 main tributaries:
* North bank (from the mouth): Maskinongé River, Rivière du Loup, Yamachiche River, Glaises Stream, Sable River
* South bank (from the mouth): Yamaska River, Saint-François River, Colbert River, Landroche River, Des Frères River, Brielle River, Lemire River, Camille-Roy River, Nicolet River

The average depth of the lake is only three meters. The channel of the seaway that has been dredged has a maximum depth of 11.3 m.

== Toponymy ==
The lake was named by Samuel de Champlain following its passage on 29 June 1603, the day of the Saint-Pierre. The Abenaki call Lake &quot;Nebesek&quot;, which means at lac. Jacques Cartier, during his second voyage to Canada in 1535, had given it the name of &quot;Angoulême&quot;.

== Natural environment ==
This seasonally-flooded area is an important stopping point for hundreds of thousands of migrating waterfowl. It is also an important nesting area for herons: more have been counted here than in any other place in North America. In 1998, it was recognized as a wetland of international significance under the Ramsar Convention.

The wildlife experts have identified 23 species of mammals around Lake Saint-Pierre, one of the most abundant species is the muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), which is found in abundance in the lake.

=== Biosphere Reserve ===
Lake Saint-Pierre was appointed Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000. &quot;The biosphere reserve of Lac-Saint-Pierre&quot; has an area of , whose in core areas and in buffer zones. The core areas are composed of Wildlife Refuge Great Island and bird refuge Nicolet.

Nearly 290 species of birds, about 90 species of fish and 27 rare plants have been listed in this biosphere reserve.

=== Wildlife Sanctuary of Great Island ===
Wildlife Sanctuary of &quot;Grande-Île&quot; (Great Island) is located on Grande-île in the Archipelago of Saint-Pierre Lake. It has an area of . This wildlife refuge was created in 1992 is the protection of one of the largest heron colonies in North America. It houses more than 5,000 herons.

=== Nicolet Bird Sanctuary ===
The &quot;birds Nicolet refuge&quot; is a protected area of which protects a staging area for ducks and Canada goose and also a nesting area for waterfowl. National Defence has acquired the site in the 1950. The site was recognized as a rest area in 1969 and as a refuge in 1982.

== History ==

Being the last freshwater basin of the St. Lawrence River and its geographical position, Lake Saint-Pierre has marked the history of French Canada in terms of the fishing industry, hunting, transportation including the St. Lawrence Seaway, pleasure boating, the settlement of surrounding lands, winter ice roads and ferries.

Samuel de Champlain wrote, in 1609: &quot;On the south side, there are two rivers, one called the&quot; Rivière du Pont (Nicolet) and the other of Gennes (Saint-François or Yamaska), which are very beautiful and in beautiful and good country. &quot;

==Environment==
Since the 1970s, the water quality of Lake Saint-Pierre has improved significantly, thanks to governmental requirements, such as:
* construction upstream of discharged water filtration centres, including those of municipalities/cities and those of industries;
* cleaning the banks and bed of the river, by municipalities/cities, organizations, businesses and riparian owners;
* revision of the composition of many manufactured products, thus reducing harmful emissions into the environment;
* implantation by riparian owners of regulated septic tanks;
* prohibition of discharge of waste water by boaters and commercial vessels;
* increased recycling of domestic and industrial waste, reducing the dumping of waste in nature;
* enhanced surveillance of water activities (e.g. Canadian Coast Guard, Environment Ministry, Municipalities/Cities).

The traffic on the river is a significant generator of shoreline erosion due to the waves produced, especially by large vessels using the St. Lawrence Seaway. The seaway has changed the course of the natural flow of the river. In places, the flow distribution in the lake due to some stagnation of water near the banks, creating a silting.

In the area of Nicolet, the bed of the lake bottom contains an undetermined number of unexploded warheads from the centre of military fire which was in operation from the 1950s to the 2000s.

== Disasters and tragedies ==
Throughout history, Lake St. Pierre has been the site of:

* Large disasters: flooding due to spring floods (usually from the beginning of April up to mid-May, sometimes until the end of May) often increased by tides, often sudden windstorms causing high waves, spring debacles, icebreaking on winter roads on the water ... These forces of nature have often resulted in damage to waterfront facilities, equipment (such as fishing equipment), buildings and boats. Sometimes debris drift (fishing huts, docks, craft ...);
* Major tragedies: sinking, drowning, hunting or fishing accidents, people in perdition or drifting on the ice ...

In the days when wood was being transported by the flow of rivers, lost wood logs floated on Lake Saint-Pierre, detached themselves from the wooden cords during the floods, or escaped from the booms on the rivers adjacent (or upstream). These floating balls occasionally caused breakage to the boats. Sometimes, chores were organized to recover them.

On the north shore, between Maskinongé and Pointe-du-Lac, Highway 40 is a jetty protecting the land from rising or storm surges, at high tide or during major floods. Some flooding is causing a significant increase in the area of Lake Saint-Pierre. The flood waters of April and May 2017 were particularly disastrous on the shores.

== In popular culture ==
* Lac Saint-Pierre is the setting of the poem, folk ballad, and animated short, &quot;the Wreck of the Julie Plante&quot;, by William Henry Drummond.
* It is not the lake sought after by Duddy Kravitz in &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; by Mordecai Richler. The lake in this book is clearly in walking distance of Lac des Sables.

<doc id="242406" wikidata="Q189443" url="?curid=242406" title="Multimedia Messaging Service">
<text>Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from a mobile phone over a cellular network. Users and providers may refer to such a message as a PXT, a picture message, or a multimedia message. The MMS standard extends the core SMS (Short Message Service) capability, allowing the exchange of text messages greater than 160 characters in length. Unlike text-only SMS, MMS can deliver a variety of media, including up to forty seconds of video, one image, a slideshow of multiple images, or audio.

Media companies have utilized MMS on a commercial basis as a method of delivering news and entertainment content, and retailers have deployed it as a tool for delivering scannable coupon codes, product images, videos, and other information. On (mainly) older devices, messages that start off with text, as SMS, are converted to and sent as an MMS when an emoji is added.

The commercial introduction of MMS started in March 2002, although picture messaging had already been established in Japan. It was built using the technology of SMS as a captive technology which enabled service providers to &quot;collect a fee every time anyone snaps a photo.&quot; MMS was designed to be able to work on the then-new GPRS and 3G networks and could be implemented through either a WAP-based or IP-based gateway. The 3GPP and WAP Forum groups fostered the development of the MMS standard, which was then continued by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). 

== Technical description ==
MMS messages are delivered in a different way from SMS. The first step is for the sending device to encode the multimedia content in a fashion similar to sending a MIME message (MIME content formats are defined in the MMS Message Encapsulation specification). The message is then forwarded to the carrier&#x27;s MMS store and forward server, known as the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Centre). If the receiver is on a carrier different from the sender, then the MMSC acts as a relay, and forwards the message to the MMSC of the recipient&#x27;s carrier using the Internet.

Once the recipient&#x27;s MMSC has received a message, it first determines whether the receiver&#x27;s handset is &quot;MMS capable&quot; or not. If it supports the standards for receiving MMS, the content is extracted and sent to a temporary storage server with an HTTP front-end. An SMS &quot;control message&quot; containing the URL of the content is then sent to the recipient&#x27;s handset to trigger the receiver&#x27;s WAP browser to open and receive the content from the embedded URL. Several other messages are exchanged to indicate the status of the delivery attempt. Before delivering content, some MMSCs also include a conversion service that will attempt to modify the multimedia content into a format suitable for the receiver. This is known as &quot;content adaptation&quot;.

If the receiver&#x27;s handset is not MMS capable, the message is usually delivered to a web-based service from where the content can be viewed from a normal web browser. The URL for the content is usually sent to the receiver&#x27;s phone in a normal text message. This behavior is usually known as a &quot;legacy experience&quot; since content can still be received by the user.

The method for determining whether a handset is MMS capable is not specified by the standards. A database is usually maintained by the operator, and in it each mobile phone number is marked as being associated with a legacy handset or not. This method is unreliable, however, because customers can independently change their handsets, and many of these databases are not updated dynamically.

MMS does not utilize operator-maintained &quot;data&quot; plans to distribute multimedia content; they are used only if the user clicks links inside the message.

E-mail and web-based gateways to the MMS system are common. On the reception side, the content servers can typically receive service requests both from WAP and normal HTTP browsers, so delivery via the web is simple. For sending from external sources to handsets, most carriers allow a MIME encoded message to be sent to the receiver&#x27;s phone number using a special e-mail address combining the recipient&#x27;s public phone number and a special domain name, which is typically carrier-specific.

== Challenges ==
There are some challenges with MMS that do not exist with SMS:

* Content adaptation: Multimedia content created by one brand of MMS phone may not be entirely compatible with the capabilities of the recipient&#x27;s MMS phone. In the MMS architecture, the recipient MMSC is responsible for providing for &quot;content adaptation&quot; (e.g., image resizing, audio codec transcoding, etc.), if this feature is enabled by the mobile network operator. When content adaptation is supported by a network operator, its MMS subscribers enjoy compatibility with a larger network of MMS users than would otherwise be available.
* Distribution lists: Current MMS specifications do not include distribution lists nor methods by which large numbers of recipients can be conveniently addressed, particularly by content providers, called &quot;Value-added service providers&quot; (VASPs) in 3GPP. Since most SMSC vendors have adopted FTP as an ad-hoc method by which large distribution lists are transferred to the SMSC prior to being used in a bulk-messaging SMS submission, it is expected that MMSC vendors will also adopt FTP.
* Bulk messaging: The flow of &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; MMS messaging involves several over-the-air transactions that become inefficient when MMS is used to send messages to large numbers of subscribers, as is typically the case for VASPs. For example, when one MMS message is submitted to a very large number of recipients, it is possible to receive a &quot;delivery report&quot; and &quot;read-reply report&quot; for each and every recipient. Future MMS specification work is likely to optimize and reduce the transactional overhead for the bulk-messaging case.
* Handset configuration: Unlike SMS, MMS requires a number of handset parameters to be set. Poor handset configuration is often blamed as the first point of failure for many users. Service settings are sometimes preconfigured on the handset, but mobile operators are now looking at new device management technologies as a means of delivering the necessary settings for data services (MMS, WAP, etc.) via over-the-air programming (OTA).
* WAP Push: Few mobile network operators offer direct connectivity to their MMSCs for content providers. This has resulted in many content providers using WAP push as the only method available to deliver &#x27;rich content&#x27; to mobile handsets. WAP push enables &#x27;rich content&#x27; to be delivered to a handset by specifying the URL (via binary SMS) of a pre-compiled MMS, hosted on a content provider&#x27;s web server. A consequence is that the receiver who pays WAP per kb or minute (as opposed to a flat monthly fee) pays for receiving the MMS, as opposed to only paying for sending one, and also paying a different rate.

Although the standard does not specify a maximum size for a message, 300 kB and 600 kB are the recommended sizes used by networks for compatibility with MMS 1.2 and MMS 1.3 devices respectively. The limit for the first generation of MMS was 50 kB.

== Interfaces ==
* MM1: the 3GPP interface between MMS User Agent and MMS Center (MMSC, the combination of the MMS Relay &amp; Server)
* MM2: the 3GPP interface between MMS Relay and MMS Server
* MM3: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and external servers
* MM4: the 3GPP interface between different MMSCs 
* MM5: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and HLR
* MM6: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and user databases
* MM7: the 3GPP interface between MMS VAS applications and MMSC 
* MM8: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and the billing systems
* MM9: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and an online charging system
* MM10: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and a message service control function
* MM11: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and an external transcoder

== Usage, decline and discontinuation ==
Verizon launched its MMS service in July 2003. Between 2010 and 2013, MMS traffic in the U.S. increased by 70% from 57 billion to 96 billion messages sent. This is due in part to the wide adoption of smartphones. However take-up of MMS never matched the widespread popularity of SMS text messaging. 

Due to lower cost and improved functionality provided by modern internet-based instant messengers such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, MMS usage has declined, and it has been discontinued by several telcos since the early 2020s. Countries with operators that have discontinued MMS include: India (BSNL; from 1 November 2015), Philippines (Sun Cellular, Smart Communications, TNT; from 28 September 2018), Singapore (Singtel, M1, Starhub; from 16 November 2021), Kazakhstan (Kcell; from 6 May 2022), Switzerland (Swisscom, Salt Mobile; from 10 January 2023), Germany (Vodafone; from 17 January 2023).

RCS is intended to be the successor technology for MMS and SMS.

<doc id="242409" wikidata="Q175240" url="?curid=242409" title="Vizier">
<text>A vizier (; ; ) is a high-ranking political advisor or minister in the Near East. The Abbasid caliphs gave the title &quot;wazir&quot; to a minister formerly called &quot;katib&quot; (secretary), who was at first merely a helper but afterwards became the representative and successor of the &quot;dapir&quot; (official scribe or secretary) of the Sassanian kings.
In modern usage, the term has been used for government ministers in much of the Middle East and beyond. Several alternative spellings are used in English, such as &quot;vizir&quot;, &quot;wazir&quot;, and &quot;vezir&quot;.

==Etymology==
Vizier may be derived from the Arabic &quot;wazara&quot; (), from the Semitic root &quot;W-Z-R&quot;. The word is mentioned in the Quran, where Aaron is described as the &quot;wazir&quot; (helper) of Moses, as well as the word &quot;wizr&quot; (burden) which is also derived from the same root. It was later adopted as a title, in the form of &quot;wazīr āl Muḥammad&quot; () by the proto-Shi&#x27;a leaders al-Mukhtar and Abu Salama. Under the Abbasid caliphs, the term acquired the meaning of &quot;representative&quot; or &quot;deputy&quot;.

Another possibility is that it is Iranian word, from the Pahlavi root of &quot;vičir&quot;, which originally had the meaning of a &quot;decree&quot;, &quot;mandate&quot;, and &quot;command&quot;, but later as its use in Dinkard also suggests, came to mean &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;magistrate&quot;. Arthur Jeffery considers the word to be a &quot;good Iranian&quot; word, as it has a well-established root in Avestan language. The Pahlavi &quot;vičir&quot;, is in fact from the Avestan &quot;vīčira&quot;, which means &quot;deciding&quot;. This Avestan root is behind the Modern Persian form of the word which is &quot;večer&quot; which means &quot;judge&quot;. This etymology is supported - among other scientists - by Johnny Cheung, Ernest David Klein and Richard Nelson Frye.

==Historical ministerial titles==

The office of vizier arose under the first Abbasid caliphs, and spread across the Muslim world.

The vizier stood between sovereign and subjects, representing the former in all matters touching the latter. The 11th-century legal theorist al-Mawardi defined two types of viziers: &quot;wazīr al-tanfīdh&quot; (&quot;vizier of execution&quot;), who had limited powers and served to implement the caliph&#x27;s policies, and the far more powerful &quot;wazīr al-tafwīd&quot; (&quot;vizier with delegated powers&quot;), with authority over civil and military affairs, and enjoyed the same powers as the caliph, except in the matter of the succession or the appointment of officials. Al-Mawardi stressed that the latter, as an effective viceroy, had to be a Muslim well versed in the &quot;Shari&#x27;a&quot;, whereas the former could also be a non-Muslim or even a slave, although women continued to be expressly barred from the office.

Historically, the term has been used to describe two very different ways: either for a unique position, the prime minister at the head of the monarch&#x27;s government (the term Grand Vizier always refers to such a post), or as a shared &#x27;cabinet rank&#x27;, rather like a British secretary of state. If one such vizier is the prime minister, he may hold the title of Grand Vizier or another title.

===In Islamic states===

*The title was first used in the early Abbasid Caliphate, cf. Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate). 
*In Muslim Persia, the prime minister under the political authority of the Shahanshah was commonly styled &quot;Vazīr-e Azam&quot; (&#x27;Supreme -, i.e. Grand Vizier&#x27;; alternative titles include &quot;Atabeg-e Azam&quot; and &quot;Sardār-e Azam&quot;), and various Ministers held cabinet rank as &quot;vazir&quot;, including a &quot;Vazir-i-Daftar&quot; (minister for finance) and a &quot;Vazir-i-Lashkar&quot; (war portfolio).
* In al-Andalus, the Umayyad Caliphs of Córdoba appointed a varying number of viziers, as heads of departments in the bureaucracy, ministers with specific tasks, and royal councillors; at one point, in 1008, there were as many as 29 viziers at the same time. Unlike the Islamic east, the senior office of the Umayyad state was that of the chamberlain (&quot;hajib&quot;). Under the Taifa kingdoms the title proliferated and became a generic court title. During the later Umayyads, viziers were also appointed outside the capital as provincial governors or commanders, a practice which continued until the fall of the Emirate of Granada in the 15th century. The Spanish word &quot;alguacil&quot; (governor, official with civil or criminal duties) derives from this.
* In Muslim Egypt, the most populous Arab country:
**Vizier under the Fatimid Caliphs.
**Again since the effective end of Ottoman rule, remarkably since 1857 (i.e. before the last Wali (governor), Isma`il Pasha, was raised Khedive (circa Viceroy, on 8 June 1867), exchanged for the western prime ministers on 28 August 1878 (before the formally independent sultanate was proclaimed).
*During the days of the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Vizier was the—often de facto ruling—prime minister, second only to the Sultan and was the leader of the Divan, the Imperial Council. &quot;Vizier&quot; was also the title of some Ottoman provincial governors, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where usage of the title often indicated a greater degree of autonomy for the province involved and the greater prestige of the title holder (this was, for example, a major issue in the Bosnian uprising of 1831). Also, many of the viziers originated from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, as well as other countries and from various ethnicities.
*In the Sherifian kingdom of Morocco (historically a sultanate until the incumbent assumed the higher royal style of &quot;Malik&quot; on 14 August 1957, shortly after the end of the simultaneous French and Spanish protectorates; the additional Islamic title &quot;Amir al-Mu´minin&quot; &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot; stayed in use), a &quot;Sadr al-A&#x27;zam&quot; (Grand Vizier) was in office until 22 November 1955, replaced since 7 December 1955 a (part-political) Prime Minister; Vizier was the style of a minister of state (other titles for various portfolios).
*In the Adal Sultanate located in the Horn of Africa.
*In the Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz (later merged into present-day Saudi Arabia), the sole Vizier was (10 June 19163 October 1924) the future second king Ali ibn Hussein al-Hashimi, under his father Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi (the first to assume the title Malik, i.e. King, instead of Grand Sharif), maintained after the assumption of the Caliphal style (only 11 March 19243 October 1924)
*In the &#x27;regency&#x27; of Tunisia, under the Husainid Dynasty, various ministers of the Bey, including:
**&quot;Wazir al-Akbar&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Kébir&quot;): &#x27;great minister&#x27;, i.e. grand vizier, chief minister or prime minister.
**&quot;Wazir al-&#x27;Amala&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Amala&quot;): Minister for the Interior.
**&quot;Wazir al-Bahr&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Bahr&quot;): Minister &#x27;of the Sea&#x27;, i.e. for the Navy/ Marine.
**&quot;Wazir al-Harb&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Harb&quot;): Minister for the Army or Minister for War.
**&quot;Wazir al-Istishara&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Istichara&quot;): Minister-Counsellor.
**&quot;Wazir al-Qalam&quot;: Minister of the Pen.
**&quot;Wazir ud-Daula&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir El Dawla&quot;): Minister of State.
**&quot;Wazir us-Shura&quot; (or &quot;El Ouzir Ech Choura&quot;): Privy Counsellor.
*In Oman the Hami/Sultan&#x27;s chief minister was styled &quot;Wazir&quot; until 1966, but in 1925–1932 there was also or instead a chairman of the council of Ministers; since 1970 the style is prime minister.
*In the Bengal Sultanate, many local officials had the title of Wazir/Uzir
*Viziers to the Sultans of Zanzibar (a branch of the Omani dynasty); since 1890 filled by British, also known as first ministers, (1 July 191323 February 1961) the British Resident (Minister)s, an extremely direct form of indirect rule (before and after chief- or prime ministers, generally native).
*Grand Viziers to the Sultan of Sokoto – however, this is disputed. The title &quot;Waziri&quot; is apparently a derivative of this word, and is a highly regarded chieftaincy title in most of northern Nigeria. Indeed, most of the emirs in northern Nigeria have a &quot;Waziri&quot;, who is usually a high-ranking adviser to the emir.
*In pre- and colonial (notably British) India many rulers, even some Hindu princes, had a vizier as chief minister – compare Diwan, Nawab wasir, Pradhan, etc.
*In the (former) sultanate of the Maldives (Divehi language), the prime minister was styled &quot;Bodu Vizier&quot;, and various Ministers held cabinet rank as &quot;vazierin&quot; (plural), including &quot;Hakura&#x27;a&quot; (portfolio of Public Works), &quot;Shahbandar&quot; (Navy portfolio, also admiral in chief), &quot;Vela&#x27;ana&#x27;a&quot; (Foreign Affairs).
* In Afghanistan, under the Durrani dynasty, the chief minister was styled &quot;Vazīr-e Azam&quot; or &quot;Wazir-i-azam&quot; (1801–1880); the &quot;Vazīr-e Darbār&quot; or &quot;Wazir al-durbar&quot; was the (&#x27;House&#x27;) Minister of the Royal Court.
* List of Ghaznavid Viziers
* In the Mataram Sultanate and subsequent sultanates, a &quot;wazir&quot; was a chief minister to the sultan.
* In the Durrani Empire, numerous wazirs were appointed over different rulers.

==Modern post-monarchy use==
&quot;Wazīr&quot; is the standard Arabic word for a government minister. Prime ministers are usually termed as &quot;Ra&#x27;īs al-Wuzara&quot; (literally, president of the ministers) or &quot;al-Wazīr al-&#x27;Awwal&quot; (prime minister). The latter term is generally found in the Maghreb, while the former is typical of usage in the Mashriq (broadly defined, including Egypt, Sudan, Levant, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula). Thus, for example, the Prime Minister of Egypt is in Arabic a &quot;wazīr&quot;.

In Iran the ministers of government are called &quot;Vazir&quot; in Persian (e.g. foreign/health &quot;Vazir&quot;), and prime minister of state before the removal of the post, was called as &quot;Nokhost Vazir&quot;.

In Pakistan, the prime minister (de facto ruling politician, formally under the president) is called &quot;Vazīr-e Azam&quot; (Persian for Grand vizier), other Ministers are styled &quot;vazir&quot;s.

In India, &quot;Vazīr&quot; is the official translation of minister in the Urdu language, and is used in ministerial oath taking ceremonies conducted in Urdu.

In East Africa – Kenya and Tanzania, ministers are referred to as Waziri in Swahili and prime ministers as Waziri Mkuu.

In the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan is sometimes given the honorific title of Wazir

In Pakistan, the foreign minister is known as &quot;Vazir-e-Khārjah&quot;.

In Brunei the vizier is classified into five titles, which are:

*The current head of vizier or &quot;Perdana Wazir&quot; of Brunei is Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. His full title is His Royal Highness Perdana Wazir Sahibul Himmah Wal-Waqar Prince Haji Mohamed Bolkiah.
*His Royal Highness Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara Prince Haji Sufri Bolkiah
*His Royal Highness Pengiran Digadong Sahibul Mal Prince Haji Jefri Bolkiah
*Pengiran Pemancha Sahibul Rae&#x27; Wal-Mashuarah – vacant
*Pengiran Temanggong Sahibul Bahar – vacant

==Princely title==
In the rare case of the Indian princely state of Jafarabad (Jafrabad, founded c. 1650), ruled by &quot;Thanadar&quot;s, in 1702 a state called Janjira was founded, with rulers (six incumbents) styled &quot;wazir&quot;; when, in 1762, Jafarabad and Janjira states entered into personal union, both titles were maintained until (after 1825) the higher style of Nawab was assumed.

==Art==
In contemporary literature and pantomime, the &quot;Grand Vizier&quot; is a character stereotype and is usually portrayed as a scheming backroom plotter and the clear power behind the throne of a usually bumbling or incompetent monarch. A well-known example of this is the sinister character of Jafar in the Disney animated film &quot;Aladdin&quot;, who plots and uses magic to take over the entire Kingdom of Agrabah under the nose of the nation&#x27;s naïve sultan, just as Jaffar in the 1940 movie &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; dethroned his master, caliph Ahmad. Others include Zigzag from &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; (the original inspiration for the character of Jafar in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;), the character Iznogoud in the eponymous French comic book by René Goscinny and Jean Tabary, Prince Sinbad&#x27;s advisor Yusuf in the DC Vertigo series &quot;Fables&quot;, and the villains of the video games &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (also called Jaffar, before the release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;) and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot;.

A much older example of this archetype is the character Haman from the biblical book of Esther. The book describes the rise of a Jewish woman to Queen of Persia, and her role in stopping the plot of Haman, chief advisor to the Persian king, to wipe out all Jews living in Persia.

==Notable viziers==

*Yahya ibn Khalid of Harun al-Rashid (Whose son Jafar bin Yahya was an inspiration for the aforementioned Arabian Nights Jafar)
*Amir Kabir of the Qajar dynasty in Iran history
*Hasanak the Vizier of the Ghaznavid dynasty in Iran history
*Almanzor of the Caliphate of Córdoba was the de facto ruler of Islamic Spain
*Nizam al-Mulk of Malik Shah I in Seljuks history
*Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. 
*Sokollu Mehmed Pasha of the Ottoman Empire.
*Köprülü Mehmed Pasha and his son Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha of the Ottoman Empire.

==Influence on chess==
In Shatranj, from which modern chess developed, the piece corresponding to the modern chess &quot;queen&quot; (though far weaker) was often called &quot;Wazīr&quot;.
Up to the present, the word for the queen piece in chess is still called by variants of the word &quot;vazīr&quot; in Middle Eastern languages, as well as in Hungarian (&quot;vezér&quot;, meaning &quot;leader&quot;) and Russian (&quot;ferz&#x27; (ферзь)&quot;).

==Playing card rank==
In Ganjifa cards, the vizier is a face card holding the second-highest rank in a suit, after the king. In Mamluk Kanjifa, there are two vizier ranks: the first vizier (na&#x27;ib malik), and the second vizier (na&#x27;ib thani). When Mamluk Kanjifa was introduced to Europe, the two ranks were transformed into the knight and knave in Latin-suited playing cards, and into the ober and unter in Swiss- and German-suited playing cards. The vizier may have had an important role in early playing card games as the Arabic term for vizier (na&#x27;ib) became synonymous to the name for playing cards in the Italian Renaissane (naibi) and even in Spain today (naipes).

In the Mysore Chad Ganjifa, the Vizier (Amatya or Mantri), is one of six court cards. It ranks third, after the King (Raja) and Queen (Rajni), and before the Knight (Senani), Jack (Padathi or Sevaka), and Banner (Dhwaja). In these cards, the vizier is depicted sitting in a ratha.

In Nabagunjara Ganjifa, the vizier is depicted as Arjuna.

<text>Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprara de Montecuccoli (English: &quot;Count George Leo of Caprivi, Caprara, and Montecuccoli&quot;; born Georg Leo von Caprivi; 24 February 1831 – 6 February 1899) was a German general and statesman. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire from March 1890 to October 1894. 

During his tenure as chancellor, Caprivi promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Germany&#x27;s conservative agrarian interests, especially the Junkers. As part of Kaiser Wilhelm&#x27;s &quot;new course&quot; in foreign policy, Caprivi abandoned Bismarck&#x27;s military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Russian Empire, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Caprivi misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Frustrated, Britain turned to the Empire of Japan and the French Third Republic for agreements. Caprivi&#x27;s downfall came with trade agreements that favored German industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the German military.

== Early life==
Leo von Caprivi was born in Charlottenburg (then a town in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, today a district of Berlin), the son of jurist Julius Leopold von Caprivi (17971865), who later became a judge at the Prussian supreme court and member of the Prussian House of Lords. His father&#x27;s family was of Italian origin (Caprara Montecuccoli, from Modena). The Caprivis were ennobled during the 17th century Ottoman–Habsburg wars. They later moved to Landau in Silesia. His mother was Emilie Köpke, daughter of Gustav Köpke, headmaster of the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster and teacher of Caprivi&#x27;s predecessor Otto von Bismarck. Caprivi&#x27;s brother was lieutenant general Raimund von Caprivi and his nephew, Leo von Caprivi was an aide-de-camp to Emperor Wilhelm II.

Caprivi&#x27;s origins differentiated him from the majority of the Prussian upper class, since he was not a large landowner. Accordingly, he later described himself as &quot;without are and straw.&quot; He was a Protestant. On a personal level, Leo von Caprivi was an affable man with few close friends, who remained unmarried.

== Military career ==
===Rise===
Caprivi was educated at the in Berlin. After graduating in 1849, he enlisted in the of the Prussian Army. As a second lieutenant, he attended the Prussian Staff College and from 1860 he was a Hauptmann in the topographic division of the German General Staff. He served in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 as a member of the staff of the 5th Division and in 1865 he was made the commander of an infantry company. He served in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 as a major in the staff of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. Afterwards he was appointed to the general staff of the Guards Corps and then in spring 1870 he was temporarily appointed chief of staff of the X Army Corps. 

Caprivi had gained a reputation as one of the most gifted students of Helmuth von Moltke and was confirmed in his post as chief of the general staff of the X Army Corps with the rank of lieutenant colonel during the Franco-Prussian War. This appointment brought the comparatively young Caprivi to public attention. During the war, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande, receiving the military order Pour le Mérite.

=== Chief of the Navy ===
After the war Caprivi first served as a department head in the Prussian War Ministry. There he was involved in drafting a law about barracks and in the introduction of the Mauser rifle. From 1878 he was placed in charge of a range of different divisions in rapid succession. In 1882, he became commander of the 30th Infantry Division at Metz.

In 1883, he succeeded Albrecht von Stosch, a fierce opponent of Chancellor Bismarck, as Chief of the Imperial Navy, with the rank of Vice-admiral. According to Robert K. Massie, this appointment was made by Bismarck and caused great dissatisfaction among the officers of the navy. He says that at the time of Caprivi&#x27;s appointment, he &quot;had no interest in naval affairs and did not know the names of his officers or the emblems of rank on the uniforms they wore.&quot; According to Thomas Nipperdey, the appointment was made against the express wishes of Bismarck, who had not wanted the Prussian Army to lose one of its best officers. He refers to Caprivi&#x27;s appointment as a &quot;deportation to the navy.&quot; In 1884, Caprivi was appointed to the State Council.

Caprivi showed significant administrative talent, in reforming and expanding the German navy. Caprivi emphasized the development and construction of torpedo boats during his tenure as naval chief. He submitted two long memoranda to the Reichstag regarding the interests of the fleet. When Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888, he made naval politics one of his personal concerns and Caprivi quickly came into conflict with the Emperor. Up to this point administration of the navy and naval military command had both been invested in the Admiralty; Wilhelm wished to separate them. Even more importantly, Wilhelm wanted an offensive navy with large battleships, which could compete with the English on the high seas. Meanwhile, Caprivi supported a traditional continental military policy, in which the fleet played an entirely defensive role. After being overruled on the issue by the Kaiser, Caprivi resigned in 1888. He was briefly appointed to the command of his old army corps, the X Army Corps stationed in Hanover.

== Chancellor of Germany ==

In February 1890, Caprivi was summoned to Berlin by Emperor Wilhelm II and informed that he was Wilhelm&#x27;s intended candidate to replace Bismarck as Chancellor, if the latter resisted Wilhelm&#x27;s proposed changes to the government. Upon Bismarck&#x27;s dismissal on 18 March, Caprivi became chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia. Though his exact motives are unknown, Wilhelm appears to have viewed Caprivi as a moderate who would make a sufficiently strong replacement for Bismarck, should the former chancellor make trouble in retirement, yet lacked the ambition to seriously oppose the throne. For his part, Caprivi was unenthusiastic, yet felt duty-bound to obey the Emperor. He said to one gathering, &quot;I know that I shall be covered in mud, that I shall fall ingloriously&quot;. After his appointment, Caprivi wrote in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; that the main task of Bismarck&#x27;s successor would be &quot;to lead the nation back after the preceding epoch of great men and deeds to an everyday existence.&quot;

Caprivi&#x27;s administration was marked by moves towards conciliation of the Social Democrats on the domestic front, and towards a pro-British foreign policy. This approach is known to historians as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;New Course&quot;), a term coined by Wilhelm II in 1890.

The American historian Robert K. Massie characterises Caprivi at the time of his appointment as follows:

Caprivi promised at the beginning of his tenure &quot;To adopt what is good, wherever and whomever it comes from, if it is compatible with the national interest.&quot; However, the important economic policies of his government derived from the ideas of Johannes von Miquel, leader of the National Liberals. In various areas, including social policy, reforms were announced. Within Prussia, Caprivi&#x27;s most important collaborators were the trade minister , the interior minister , and the war minister Hans von Kaltenborn-Stachau. At the imperial level, his key allies were the Secretary for the Interior Karl von Boetticher and Secretary for the Foreign Affairs Adolf von Bieberstein. Caprivi&#x27;s policy of moderation had clear limits; the authority of the monarchy and the state was not to be diminished. Legal restrictions of rights of association, for example, were not removed, the disciplinary rules for Beamte were strengthened, and appointments in the judiciary went to trusted conservatives. Nipperdey characterises this policy as &quot;enlightened bureaucratic-conservatism.&quot;

In order to carry out his political agenda, Caprivi, like Bismarck before him, required the approval of the Reichstag. A new factor, however, was that the Emperor now wished to exercise direct political influence. His changing positions and apparently absolutist desires became a decisive political factor from the time of Caprivi&#x27;s appointment onwards. Opposition from Bismarck also remained a significant factor. A further problem for Caprivi was the relationship between the German Empire and Prussia. Unlike Bismarck, Caprivi&#x27;s leadership style within the Prussian State Ministry was markedly collegial. This change was made clear even in his appointment speech in the Prussian House of Representatives. Unlike Bismarck, he never demanded to be present with the emperor when one of his ministers was exercising his rights of immediate authority. However, this made it more difficult for him to get political policies implemented and allowed the Prussian finance minister Miquel to gain influence well beyond his area of authority.

===Foreign Policy===
====Ending the Reinsurance Treaty====
Only a week into office, Caprivi was forced to choose whether to renew the Reinsurance Treaty, a secret alliance Bismarck had made with Russia. Although he was a military man, war was not a political option for Caprivi and he opposed General Alfred von Waldersee&#x27;s proposal for Germany to ally with Austria-Hungary and carry out a preventive war against Russia. Nevertheless, he followed the decision of officials of the Foreign Office around Friedrich von Holstein not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty and focus on a more straightforward alliance with Austria-Hungary. Unaware of the Foreign Office&#x27;s determination, Wilhelm II had personally assured Russian Ambassador Count Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov that the treaty would be renewed. When Caprivi discussed the issue with the Emperor, Wilhelm II yielded to his Chancellor, unwilling to dismiss another chancellor one week after dismissing Bismarck. The treaty was not renewed, and Shuvalov was shocked at the sudden reversal.

The decision led to the Reinsurance Treaty becoming public knowledge for the first time and prompted sharp criticism from supporters of Bismarck. In the press, Caprivi was subsequently attacked as a dilettante in foreign policy. Several historians have argued that this decision caused the encirclement of Germany which finally led to it fighting on two fronts in the First World War. However, the German relationship with Russia had already deteriorated in the final years of Bismarck&#x27;s chancellorship, especially as a result of trade disputes regarding Russian agricultural exports. At the same time, strong forces in Russian politics were already pushing for a rapprochement with France in the late 1880s. It is unclear that renewing the Reinsurance Treaty could have overcome these factors. Although the ending of the Reinsurance Treaty was not the beginning of the crisis in German-Russian relations, it did have considerable consequences. In 1893 and 1894, Russia forged the Alliance with France and Germany was thus more closely committed to Austria-Hungary. Thus, the decision contributed to the formation of competing power blocks in Europe.

In place of the Reinsurance Treaty, Caprivi pursued the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy. He then sought to expand this through good relations with Britain.

====Colonial policy====

Success in Caprivi&#x27;s pro-British policy was exemplified by the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty of July 1890, which had been largely prepared under Bismarck. In this treaty, the British gave Germany the small island of Heligoland in the North Sea and a strip of land named the Caprivi Strip after him, which was added to German South West Africa, thus linking that territory with the Zambezi River. Caprivi&#x27;s goal in acquiring Heligoland was to secure the German North Sea coast and he hoped that the Caprivi strip would allow Germany to use the Zambezi for trade and communications with eastern Africa (the river proved to be unnavigable). In return, Germany gave up its protectorate over Wituland and Zanzibar in East Africa. More generally, the treaty was intended as a signal to Britain that Germany did not seek to challenge its status as the dominant colonial power. Caprivi hoped that the treaty would be the beginning of closer relations between the two countries, culminating in an alliance. The British also wanted closer relations, but Caprivi&#x27;s government failed to make an agreement. This was partially due to conflicting approaches and interests in the Ottoman Empire. The treaty also sparked opposition to Caprivi within Germany from colonialist pressure-groups like the &quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot;.

In general, Caprivi did not believe that Germany should compete with other powers for overseas colonies but rather should focus on its position within Europe, since he did not think that Germany would be able to defend an extensive colonial empire against the British in the event of a war. As a result, he did not support expansion of the German Colonial Empire.

====Trade policy====
Caprivi pursued an aggressive trade policy, saying &quot;either we export goods or we export men.&quot; In his view, German Great Power status was not sustainable in the long-term without a powerful industrial sector. He also considered trade policy part of general foreign policy and sought to bind other countries to Germany politically through commercial treaties. A tightly intertwined &quot;economic area of 130 million men&quot; was meant to prevent the outbreak of military conflicts. He obtained commercial treaties with Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Serbia, Romania, Belgium, and Russia. These treaties reduced protective agricultural tariffs, which lowered the price of food in Germany. They also assisted the expansion of German trade through exports of industrial products.

In sum, Caprivi&#x27;s approach marked the end of the protectionist &quot;&quot; of the later part of Bismarck&#x27;s chancellorship, but it was far from being a policy of free trade. Caprivi&#x27;s policy enjoyed the support of a majority in the Reichstag and Wilhelm II cited his economic policies as grounds for his decision to promote Caprivi to the status of Count. This general support subsided quickly after Caprivi ended the trade war with Russia in 1894. This not only allowed the export of German industrial products but also a limited increase in agricultural imports to Germany. The damaged relationship with Russia was clearly improved, but internally it brought fierce opposition from agriculturalists.

Opponents were angry at the downplaying of German agriculture in favor of urban workers. Led by East Elbian Junkers, a coalition emerged that included peasant farmers, artisans, and conservative intellectuals hostile to the emerging industrial society. They demanded the Kaiser remove Caprivi. The Agrarian League was launched in 1893 to protest the reduction in tariffs against imported grains. The league was organized nationally like a political party, with local chapters, centralized discipline, and a clear-cut platform. It fought against free trade, industrialization, and liberalism. Its most hated enemy was socialism, which it blamed on Jewish financial capitalism. The League helped establish grassroots anti-Semitism of the sort that flourished into the 1930s.

===Domestic policy===
====Policy of compromise====

Caprivi saw the state as a monarchical-social authority, based on Christian traditions. He sought to include all political parties through a balance of opposing domestic viewpoints. This was welcomed in the Reichstag and in public discourse. Caprivi saw himself as a kind of mediator between the crown and the Reichstag. However, he could not rely on the support of a strong party in the Reichstag and had to cobble together regularly shifting majorities. Nonetheless, the policy of compromise (&quot;Politik des Ausgleichs&quot;) initially had a real chance of success.

He attempted not only to win the support of civic liberals and conservative forces, but also to forge a working arrangement with representatives of the Poles and the recently annexed Province of Hanover in the Reichstag. The abolition of the decreased tension with the German-Hanoverian Party. Caprivi believed that the support of the Poles would be required in the event of a war with Russia and - more immediately - he needed the votes of their representatives in the Reichstag. He made concessions on the question of Polish language use in schools, eased work of Polish cooperative banks, and permitted a Polish archbishop for Poznań and Gniezno. However, the policy did not survive Caprivi&#x27;s resignation and had no enduring consequences.

More consequential were his overtures to the Centre Party and the Social Democrats. By reimbursing the Catholic Church for state money that had been frozen during the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, Caprivi sought to win over the Catholic camp represented by the Centre Party. He conciliated the SPD by abandoning any attempt to renew the Anti-Socialist Laws and announcing reforms to the Prussian three-class franchise. However, this policy had clear limits: the executive, police, and judiciary continued to oppose the social democrats even without a special law. The attempt to modify the Prussian three-class franchise was rebuffed by the traditional elites, who forced the resignation of the interior minister and his replacement with the conservative Botho zu Eulenburg.

==== Social policy and tax reform ====
The social question meant that a progressive social policy was a central aspect of the reforms. Initially, these reforms were fully supported by Wilhelm II, in line with his idea of a &quot;social empire.&quot; Caprivi attempted to use socio-political measures to neutralise the &quot;revolutionary threat&quot; supposedly posed by social democracy. In addition to the initial express support of Wilhelm II, the reforms were especially pushed by the Prussian minister of trade, . The employment of children under the age of 13, who had not yet completed their compulsory schooling, in factories was forbidden and 13- to 18-year-olds restricted to a maximum 10-hour day. In 1891 Sunday working was forbidden and a guaranteed minimum wage introduced, and working hours for women were reduced to a maximum of 11. In addition, labour regulations were passed and industrial tribunals were established in 1890 to arbitrate in industrial disputes. Caprivi explicitly invited social-democratic representatives of trade unions to sit on these tribunals. An amendment of the Prussian mining law was proposed and support was offered for workers&#x27; housing. However, this policy had already come to a standstill in the later part of Caprivi&#x27;s chancellorship.

The &quot;Miquelsche tax reform&quot;, named for Johannes von Miquel, introduced a progressive income tax for the first time, which was supported by lower-income earners and also benefited landowners. In connection with the tax reform, new rural district regulations were passed, which extended suffrage to 200,000 people who had hitherto been excluded from political participation. The conservatives successfully watered down the reform so that only a minority of manors were affected.

=== Opposition to Caprivi ===

Due to his &quot;Policy of Compromise&quot; and especially his foreign and trade policies, opposition to Caprivi became widespread. It was particularly strong on the right, but eventually the army and Wilhelm II became opponents as well.

==== Right-wing opposition ====
An important role in the development of right-wing opposition was played by Otto von Bismarck, who took advantage of positive statements about Caprivi from his &quot;support parties&quot;, in order to publicly campaign against the &quot;leftist policy&quot; of his successor. Bismarck&#x27;s position was strengthened by Caprivi&#x27;s clumsiness, when he blocked a planned meeting between Bismarck and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary. Bismarck had been unpopular at the end of his chancellorship, but he now improved his reputation and became a centre of a right-wing opposition movement.

After the conclusion of the Zanzibar treaty with Britain, supporters of colonialism attacked Caprivi for selling off German interests. Even Bismarck, whose attitudes towards overseas expansion were lukewarm, participated in the attacks, with sharp criticism. An important opponent of the restrained colonial policy was the Alldeutscher Verband, a popular right-wing organisation. Meanwhile, Caprivi&#x27;s trade policy led to strong opposition among conservative landowners. There were massive protests, in which large landowners were notable participants.
This proclamation in 1893 led to the establishment of the German Agrarian League.

On 20 December 1893, the conservative &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; spoke of an &quot;unbridgeable chasm between the chancellor and the conservatives.&quot; In the German Conservative Party, criticism focussed especially on the rural district reforms, the commercial treaty with Austria in 1891, and the failure of a school reform based on religious confession. Hitherto, the party had been friendly to government, but it now become an oppositional force. At the &quot;Tivoliparteitag&quot; of 1892 it declared its support for Adolf Stoecker and his anti-semitic position.

==== Education bill and resignation in Prussia ====
Caprivi was also attacked by the National Liberals, Progressives, Free-minded liberals, and Free Conservatives whom he had tried to bring into his tent. The reason for this was an educational bill providing denominational board schools, a failed attempt to re-integrate the Catholic Centre Party into the conservative establishment after the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. Caprivi, although himself a Protestant, needed the 100 votes of the Catholic Centre Party but that alarmed the Protestant politicians. The publication of the draft law prompted an unexpectedly strong storm of indignation from civic liberals and moderate conservatives. Wilhelm II withdrew his support from the law. After the culture minister, resigned in 1892, Caprivi offered his own resignation as well. As a result, Caprivi lost his position as Prussian Minister President and was replaced by Count Botho zu Eulenburg, leading to an untenable division of powers between the Chancellor and the Prussian premier. Caprivi had lost the Emperor&#x27;s trust, even as the conflict between Caprivi and Eulenburg increased the Emperor&#x27;s ability to exercise personal authority.

==== Clash over the Military bill====
Simultaneously, a conflict arose over a new military bill. This consisted of an increase in the strength of the Imperial German Army and a decrease in military service from three years to two. The shortening of military service provoked considerable criticism from traditional military men in the Emperor&#x27;s circle. Wilhelm himself harshly criticised the reduction of military service, since his grandfather Wilhelm I had instituted the three-year military service through considerable personal effort with the support of Bismarck in the 1860s. Some modernisers welcomed the measures, because they raised the number of reservists, but overall Caprivi lost support in military circles. Wilhelm II initially opposed the bill, but eventually allowed himself to be persuaded by the chancellor. Caprivi was unable to get the bill through the Reichstag, so he had it dissolved and called an early election in 1893. The newly elected Reichstag approved a plan which accorded with Caprivi&#x27;s intentions. The left-liberals splintered on the military question. Eugen Richter and his Free-minded People&#x27;s Party rejected the plan completely, but the Free-minded Union sought a compromise with Caprivi. The Centre Party was initially prepared to support Caprivi, but withdrew from him after the failure of the school reforms and as the criticism of the military plan increased.

====Fall====
By 1893, Caprivi&#x27;s position had been weakened by several factors. Caprivi clashed with Wilhelm increasingly during his term as Chancellor, offering his resignation nearly a dozen times in four years. The Kaiser privately called him &quot;a sensitive old fathead&quot;. In the Reichstag, there was no stable majority. Prussia had become an independent centre of power. The anger of the Conservatives intensified, accompanied by constant public attacks by retired Bismarck.

The actual end of Caprivi&#x27;s chancellorship was triggered by his approach to the social democrats. The emperor had moved away from his initial social policy, under the influence of Carl Ferdinand von Stumm-Halberg, and now supported a law against the &quot;revolutionary parties.&quot; Accordingly, Eulenburg announced an Imperial law against &quot;revolutionary tendencies.&quot; It was clear that the Reichstag would not agree to this law, so he proposed that the Reichstag be dissolved and new elections held. Since a new Reichstag was also likely to reject the law against &quot;revolutionary tendencies,&quot; he also proposed to enact a new electoral law which would insure the desired majority. In addition, Eulenburg&#x27;s plan was also intended to get rid of Caprivi, who would not support a law akin to the Anti-Socialist laws that he himself had abolished. Wilhelm II made his own support for a battle against the &quot;parties of revolution&quot; clear. Caprivi remained opposed and offered his resignation. At first Wilhelm attempted to prevent this and turned against Eulenberg. But Eulenburg managed to persuade Wilhelm II that Caprivi was responsible for the publication of important private conversations between the emperor and the chancellor. Thus, on 26 October 1894, Wilhelm II required both Caprivi and Eulenburg to resign. They were succeeded by Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst.

Caprivi destroyed his papers on the evening of his resignation and departed for Montreux the next day. He made no public appearances for months and, throughout his retirement, he refused to speak or write publicly about his experiences as Chancellor or share his opinions on current events. He lived with his nephew at Skyren (today known as Skórzyn, Poland) and died there in 1899.

== Contemporary evaluations and historiography ==
Caprivi&#x27;s contemporaries differed in their evaluations of him. The social democrat historian Franz Mehring wrote a retrospective in &quot;Die Neue Zeit&quot;, in which he said that Caprivi had &quot;the most earnest wish to eliminate the dirty corruption, which had pervaded the German sphere under Bismarck... so long as society remains the same, it will not deliver an Imperial Chancellor better than Caprivi was.&quot; Karl Bachem, the Centre Party&#x27;s expert on history, also evaluated Caprivi positively.&lt;ref name=&quot;sp8/I/27&quot;&gt;Spenkuch: &quot;Einleitung in Acta Borussica.&quot; Vol. 8/I, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his successors, Caprivi had a positive reputation in Britain.

Otto von Bismarck had initially praised Caprivi, saying that he &quot;has a clear head, a good heart, a magnanimous nature, and a great capacity for work. All in all, a man of the first rank.&quot; But the old chancellor soon became one of Caprivi&#x27;s fiercest critics. His portrayal of Caprivi as a &quot;political midget&quot; had an enduring impact on his reputation. Additionally, Caprivi&#x27;s rival characterised him mockingly as a &quot;mixture of a junior officer and an audit committee.&quot;

Bismarck&#x27;s judgement was closely linked to negative judgements on his decision not to extend the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. This decision appeared to have been a catastrophic reversal of the principles of Bismarck&#x27;s policy. For a long time, historians characterised Caprivi as a hard-working and honourable, but limited general, who was not capable of continuing Bismarck&#x27;s genius. In the 1920s, General von Schweidnitz, who had been ambassador to Russia under Caprivi, made a statement which has been frequently cited as evidence of Caprivi&#x27;s incompetence in foreign affairs: 

This image has been nuanced in recent years. Current scholarship no longer considers the decision not to extend the Reinsurance Treaty to have been a catastrophe and the treaty itself is seen as a stopgap rather than a stroke of diplomatic genius.

An alternative evaluation of Caprivi developed gradually. In 1957, Heinrich Otto Meisner characterised him as a capable orator but a poor persuader. In his view, he was not a political general and as a &quot;chancellor in uniform&quot; was a politician of limited ability, a conscientious character who sought to persuade and be persuaded, and managed only through great toil and study to match what came naturally to others. In the late 1950s, Golo Mann painted a picture of Caprivi that was almost diametrically opposed to the negative evaluations of the first half of the twentieth century, characterising him as single-minded, unbiased, and incorruptible: &quot;among the series of German chancellors between 1890 and 1918, he was the best.&quot; According to Mann, Caprivi sought only to do what was right, but was politically inexperienced and naively expected to receive support from &quot;good men,&quot; failing to realise that in politics few people are &quot;good,&quot; nor can be good. Current research is more sober, but acknowledges that Caprivi had some important achievements. In 2006, Klaus Rüdiger Metze considered that Caprivi had understood that Germany was transforming from an agrarian economy to an industrial one and had helped this process through his social and trade policies. In Metze&#x27;s view, Caprivi was capable of compromise and self-criticism, as well as tenacious pursuit of his goals. Metze attributes the failure of his policy of liberal-conservative reform to his inability to negotiate effectively with his internal political opponents.

Heinrich August Winkler concludes that Caprivi and his allies in the Imperial service were motivated by an honest desire for reform, but that Caprivi undermined these efforts as a result of &quot;major mistakes&quot; like the school reform law and the military plan. Thomas Nipperdey argued that Caprivi&#x27;s New Course was a promising and optimistic attempt at a systematic and open re-orientation of Imperial politics and that it failed as a result of the particular party system at the time, the opposition of special interest groups, the tension between Prussia and the rest of the Empire, and the supercilious attitude of feudal agrarian conservativism and the semi-absolute military monarchy towards Caprivi&#x27;s rational-bureaucratic brand of conservativism. Nipperdey also concludes that he failed to manage the Emperor&#x27;s volatility and desire to participate directly in government. Hans-Ulrich Wehler judged that Caprivi&#x27;s New Course represented a sharp break with Bismarck&#x27;s policy, but that the problems he faced were not resolvable without firm political support.

<doc id="242414" wikidata="Q2331578" url="?curid=242414" title="Jafar (Aladdin)">
<text>Jafar is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; animated film &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992). He is voiced by Jonathan Freeman, who also portrayed the character in the Broadway musical adaptation. Jafar also appears in the 1994 sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot;, but he is not in the 1996 third film or the television series, although he does return in the latter&#x27;s crossover &quot;Hercules and the Arabian Night&quot;.

An inspiration to the character is the villain Jaffar, played by Conrad Veidt in &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, from which &quot;Aladdin&quot; borrows several character ideas and plot elements. The Jafar of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; plays essentially the same part as the character from the 1940 film, and is drawn with notable similarity to Veidt&#x27;s looks. He is also loosely based on the real-life Abbasid vizier Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya.

== Development ==
Animator Andreas Deja decided to design Jafar in a way he was contrasting to the other characters, with many vertical lines against the curvy designs based on Al Hirschfeld.

Jonathan Freeman, who composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman met when he auditioned for &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and had previously invited Freeman to audition for both &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, said that the artwork was what got him truly interested in the role. He stated that &quot;once I saw those heavy lidded eyes, that long narrow face, I knew that Jafar was going to be something really special.&quot; He was the first actor cast, and spent 21 months recording dialogue; he went months without any other actors to interact, and later interrupted theater tours to fly to Los Angeles and record newly written lines. When Deja first met Freeman, he was surprised to see the lack of physical similarity to the character, but included some of Freeman&#x27;s acting and gesturing into Jafar&#x27;s animation.

== Appearances ==
=== Films ===
==== &quot;Aladdin&quot; ====

In the 1992 adaptation of Aladdin, where he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman, Jafar is the grand vizier of Agrabah, the Sultan&#x27;s most trusted advisor. He is also an evil and sinister sorcerer who strongly dislikes being second best. Jafar secretly plots to obtain the Genie&#x27;s magical oil lamp and rule Agrabah. Early in the film, Aladdin is imprisoned in the palace dungeons, as arranged by Jafar due to his influence over the guards. When Princess Jasmine angrily confronts him over the incident, Jafar lies to her, pretending to have believed that Aladdin abducted her and saying that he was already executed. That night Jafar (disguised as a fellow prisoner) approaches Aladdin, striking a deal with him. In exchange for Aladdin&#x27;s help in retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, Jafar reveals an escape route from the prison and promises him a reward if he succeeds, it is soon revealed that the reward is death. When the plan fails, Aladdin and the lamp are lost. The Sultan later scolds Jafar for supposedly executing an innocent life behind his back without consulting him, in which Jafar pretends to regret his actions and promises not to do it again. When his pet parrot Iago suggests an alternative plan, Jafar decides to use the hypnotic powers of his cobra-headed staff to manipulate the Sultan into mandating a marriage between himself and Jasmine. This plan also instigates Jafar&#x27;s limerence towards Jasmine and thus he genuinely wants to have her as his bride. However, he is impeded by Aladdin, who had discovered the Genie and used his first wish to become a Prince. Seeing “Prince Ali” as a potential threat to his plans and a rival for Jasmines’s hand in marriage, he plots to dispose of him. After a second attempt by Jafar on his life, Aladdin (with the help of the Genie and his second wish) survives and then exposes Jafar&#x27;s plot against the Sultan; however, Jafar learns that Aladdin possesses the lamp before making his escape.

Iago steals the lamp from Aladdin and Jafar becomes the Genie&#x27;s new master. Jafar uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world&#x27;s most powerful sorcerer. Jafar assumes control of the palace (which is lifted off the ground and put on the main top of a mountain by Genie) and banishes Aladdin to a frozen wasteland. Jafar then turns the Sultan into a puppet, allowing Iago to torture the Sultan by force-feeding him crackers as revenge for the crackers the Sultan fed Iago. A horrified Jasmine begs Jafar to stop and Jafar does so. Jafar, seeking a queen to rule Agrabah alongside him, offers Jasmine his hand in marriage. Jasmine angrily refuses and throws a cup of wine in his face. An angered Jafar decides to use his final wish to wish for Jasmine to fall desperately in love with him. Genie tries to inform Jafar that he cannot use his magic to make people fall in love, but Jafar, grabbing him by the beard, demands him to do it anyway. Their argument causes him to not notice that Aladdin has returned and Jasmine decides to help Aladdin steal back the lamp by pretending that she is now in love with Jafar. Jafar, believing that Genie has somehow granted him his wish, goes up to Jasmine to seduce her without realizing she is tricking him. He notices Aladdin, however, from the reflection of Jasmine&#x27;s crown, and he realizes the whole thing was a ruse.

Aladdin battles Jafar (who has turned into a giant hostile cobra) and taunts him with the fact that he is only the second-most powerful being on Earth after Genie, who was the one who gave him his power in the first place and can very easily take it away. Realizing that what Aladdin says is true and that he’s still “second best”, Jafar, consumed by his hunger for power, uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie, in an attempt to rule the whole universe. However, as Jafar revels in his newfound phenomenal cosmic power, he finds out too late that Aladdin has tricked him into wasting his wish on becoming a genie, which also comes with a catch since genies are not free beings, and becomes trapped in a magic lamp of his own, which is sent into the Cave of Wonders by the Genie.

==== &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; ====

In &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, Jafar&#x27;s lamp is found by Abis Mal, who summons Jafar from the lamp. Jafar plots to get revenge on Aladdin. He nearly succeeds at killing Aladdin and taking control of the palace, but Iago, who has changed sides, destroys Jafar&#x27;s lamp in lava. Jafar dies in an explosion of magic, since a genie imprisoned in a lamp cannot survive without it. As a result, Jafar was never returned, neither in &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; nor in the television series, but was often referred to by name by the other characters (namely Iago).

==== &quot;Descendants&quot; ====

Jafar appears in &quot;Descendants&quot; alongside Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and the Evil Queen, as part of a group of Disney villains who are the parents of the film&#x27;s four main characters, with Maz Jobrani playing the role. In the film, he is the father of Jay, who steals items for his father&#x27;s store.

==== &quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019 film) ====

Depicted younger in the 2019 live-action version, Jafar is still the grand vizer, but more emphasis is placed on his past as a thief in his youth and his ambition to use Agrabah to invade the kingdom of Shirabad out of revenge for his time in its dungeons. The Sultan&#x27;s wife and Princess Jasmine&#x27;s late mother, the Queen, was stated to have been a Princess of Shirabad prior to her marriage to the Sultan, and it is possible that Jafar arranged her murder as both revenge for his imprisonment and possibly to instigate war between the two kingdoms. The film also presents Jafar as a foil to Aladdin, the former explicitly comparing their thief backgrounds and desire to improve their social status. While Aladdin wants just enough to live comfortably, Jafar is shown to never be satisfied with what he has gained as long as there are those greater than himself. Aladdin uses that character flaw to trick Jafar into using his last wish to become a genie, resulting in his imprisonment and being thrown into the Cave of Wonders by the Genie. Marwan Kenzari played the role.

=== Television series ===
==== &quot;Hercules&quot; ====

In the episode &quot;Hercules and the Arabian Night&quot; of &quot;Hercules: The Animated Series&quot;, Jafar makes another attempt at revenge and is resurrected by Hercules&#x27;s arch-enemy, Hades. He has lost his status as an all-powerful immortal genie after dying, but Hades gives him a new cobra staff that makes him flesh and blood as long as he holds it, and the two villains team up to get rid of Aladdin and Hercules. However, due to Aladdin&#x27;s wit and Hercules&#x27;s strength, Jafar is defeated for the final time, being pulled into the River Styx forever.

==== &quot;House of Mouse&quot; ====
Jafar is featured in many episodes of &quot;House of Mouse&quot; where he is often found in the audience. In one episode &quot;Donald&#x27;s Lamp Trade&quot;, Jafar hypnotizes Donald Duck to steal a lamp for him, but it turns out that he only wanted a clock-like lamp and not the real magical one. He has another major role in the episode &quot;House of Magic&quot;, where after a badly botched magic act by Daisy, in which she makes the club disappear, Mickey asks Jafar for help in bringing the club back, whereupon he and Iago perform a version of &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot; to cast the spell. He also appears in the series&#x27; two direct-to-video films, appearing briefly in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;, and as the main antagonist in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot; as the leader of Disney Villains. In an episode inspired by this last film, &quot;Pete&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;, Jafar replaces Donald as the club&#x27;s goalkeeper, where he keeps the other &quot;Aladdin&quot; characters from coming into House of Mouse.

==== &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; ====
An alternate version of Jafar appears in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; spin-off &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;. Naveen Andrews portrays the character, an ally of the Red Queen. In this continuity, Jafar is the illegitimate son of the Sultan, and his interest in genies stems from his mentor and lover, Amara, who discovered a ritual that could be used to rewrite the laws of magic using the power of three genies and two sorcerers. Jafar betrayed Amara by transforming her into his serpent staff so that he could have her power for himself.

Andrews did not reprise his role in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;&#x27;s sixth season due to a scheduling conflict, and he was replaced by Oded Fehr.

=== Video games ===
==== &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; ====
Jafar debuted in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as one of the members of Maleficent&#x27;s inner circle. Here, he plans to use The Heartless and take over Agrabah while he attempts to locate both Jasmine (as she is one of the Princesses of Heart) and Agrabah&#x27;s Keyhole. Jafar eventually manages to steal Genie&#x27;s lamp from Aladdin and kidnap Jasmine in the process. Sora, Aladdin, Donald Duck and Goofy track him to the Cave of Wonders, where Jafar used his first wish to reveal the world&#x27;s keyhole. Upon arrival in the lamp chamber, they engage Jafar in battle after he used his second wish to enlist Genie&#x27;s help in the fight. Upon his defeat, Jafar uses his final wish to become a Genie and battles the team again, only to be defeated and sealed away in the lamp.

Facsimiles of Jafar appear in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, based on Sora&#x27;s memories

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Jafar&#x27;s lamp is found by the Peddler, making him a target for Pete as he reveals his intent to make Jafar into a Heartless under his control. Once Pete is driven off, the lamp is placed within the palace for safe keeping. However, Jafar is later released by the Peddler and he threatens Iago into tricking him get Sora and his friends on a wild goose chase to their death while he captures Princess Jasmine. After the heroes arrive, with Iago taking a hit meant that he had been tricked by Jafar and redeems for Aladdin, Sora defeats Jafar, causing him to implode with his lamp dissolving soon after.

A data version of him appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Coded&quot;, based on the digitized data from Jiminy&#x27;s Journal.

Jonathan Freeman voiced Jafar in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

====Other games====

Jafar appears in the mobile game Disney Heroes Battle Mode

=== Disney Parks and live shows ===
In the Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios version of Fantasmic! Nighttime Show Spectacular, Jafar is one of the villains the Evil Queen evokes to fight Mickey Mouse and ruin his imagination. Jafar appears with Maleficent, Ursula and Oogie Boogie in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom Halloween-themed fireworks program &quot;HalloWishes&quot; at Mickey&#x27;s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. In the StarKid Productions musical &quot;Twisted&quot;, a parody of both &quot;Aladdin&quot; inspired by the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, Jafar is a main character and the storyline tells the Aladdin story from his point of view.

<text>Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik (; ;  – May 5, 1995) was a Soviet and Russian chess grandmaster who held five world titles in three different reigns. The sixth World Chess Champion, he also worked as an electrical engineer and computer scientist and was a pioneer in computer chess. He also had a mathematics degree (honorary).

Botvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union. He also played a major role in the organization of chess, making a significant contribution to the design of the World Chess Championship system after World War II and becoming a leading member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to dominate top-class chess during that time. His pupils include World Champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik. He is often described as the patriarch of the Soviet chess school and is revered for his analytical approach to chess.

== Early years ==
Botvinnik was born on August 17, 1911, in what was then Kuokkala, Vyborg Governorate, Grand Duchy of Finland, now the district of Repino in Saint Petersburg. His parents were Russian Jews; his father, Moisei Botvinnik (1878–1931), was a dental technician and his mother, Shifra (Serafima) Rabinovich (1876–1952), a dentist, which allowed the family to live outside the Pale of Settlement, to which most Jews in the Russian Empire were restricted at the time. As a result, Botvinnik grew up in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Nevsky Prospect. His father forbade speaking Yiddish at home, and Mikhail and his older brother Isaak &quot;Issy&quot; attended Soviet schools. Botvinnik later recounted, &quot;I was asked once, &quot;What do you consider yourself to be from the point of view of nationality?&quot; My reply was, &quot;Yes, my position is &#x27;complicated&#x27;. I am a Jew by blood, a Russian by culture, Soviet by upbringing.&quot;&quot; On his religious views, he called himself an atheist.

In 1920, his mother became ill and his father left the family, but maintained contact with the children, even after his second marriage to a Russian woman. At about the same time, Botvinnik started reading newspapers, and became a committed communist.

In autumn 1923, at the age of twelve, Botvinnik was taught chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and instantly fell in love with the game. He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother&#x27;s friends, and concluded that for him it was better to think out &quot;concrete concepts&quot; and then derive general principles from these – and went on to beat his brother&#x27;s friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school&#x27;s championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the Petrograd Chess Assembly – to which its president turned a blind eye. Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, Nikolai Krylenko, a devoted chess player and leading member of the Soviet legal system who later organized Joseph Stalin&#x27;s show trials, began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city&#x27;s Palace of Labour.

To test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Krylenko organized the Moscow 1925 chess tournament. On a rest day during the event, world champion José Raúl Capablanca gave a simultaneous exhibition in Leningrad. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won his game. In 1926, he reached the final stage of the Leningrad championship. Later that year, he was selected for Leningrad&#x27;s team in a match against Stockholm, held in Sweden, and scored +1=1 against the future grandmaster Gösta Stoltz. On his return, he entertained his schoolmates with a vivid account of the rough sea journey back to Russia. Botvinnik was commissioned to annotate two games from the match, and the fact that his analyses were to be published made him aware of the need for objectivity. In December 1926, he became a candidate member of his school&#x27;s Komsomol branch. Around this time his mother became concerned about his poor physique, and as a result he started a programme of daily exercise, which he maintained for most of his life.
When Botvinnik finished the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education. While waiting, he qualified for his first USSR Championship final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth and sixth places and gained the title of master. He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the &quot;Proletstud&quot;, which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University&#x27;s Mathematics Department. In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also deputy chairman of the &quot;Proletstud&quot;, secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic&#x27;s Electromechanical Department, where he was one of only four students who entered straight from school. As a result, he had to do a whole year&#x27;s work in five months, and failed one of the examinations. Early in the same year he placed joint third in the semi-final stage of the USSR Championship, and thus failed to reach the final stage.

His early progress was fairly rapid, mostly under the training of Soviet Master and coach Abram Model, in Leningrad; Model taught Botvinnik the Winawer Variation of the French Defence, which was then regarded as inferior for Black, but Botvinnik analysed it more deeply and played this variation with great success.

Botvinnik won the Leningrad Masters&#x27; tournament in 1930 with a score of 6½/8, following this up the next year by winning the championship of Leningrad by 2½ points over former Soviet champion Peter Romanovsky.

In 1935, Botvinnik married Gayane Davidovna Ananova, of Armenian descent, who was the daughter of his algebra and geometry teacher. She was a student at the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet in Leningrad and, later, a ballerina in the Bolshoi Theatre. They had one daughter, named Olga, who was born in 1942.

== Soviet champion ==

In 1931, at the age of 20, Botvinnik won his first Soviet Championship in Moscow, scoring 13½ out of 17. He commented that the field was not very strong, as some of the pre-Revolution masters were absent. In late summer 1931, he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering, after completing a practical assignment on temporary transmission lines at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. He stayed on at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute to study for a Candidate of Sciences degree.

In 1933, Botvinnik repeated his Soviet Championship win, in his home city of Leningrad, with 14/19, describing the results as evidence that Krylenko&#x27;s plan to develop a new generation of Soviet masters had borne fruit. He and other young masters successfully requested the support of a senior Leningrad Communist Party official in arranging contests involving both Soviet and foreign players, as there had been none since the Moscow 1925 chess tournament. Soon afterwards, Botvinnik was informed that Alexander Ilyin-Genevsky, one of the older Soviet masters and a member of the Soviet embassy in Prague, had arranged a match between Botvinnik and Salo Flohr, a Czech grandmaster who was then regarded as one of the most credible contenders for Alexander Alekhine&#x27;s World Chess Championship title. The highest-level chess officials in the Soviet Union opposed this on the grounds that Botvinnik stood little chance against such a strong international opponent. In spite of this attempt to dissuade him, Krylenko insisted on staging the match, saying that &quot;We have to know our real strength.&quot;

Botvinnik used what he regarded as the first version of his method of preparing for a contest, but fell two games behind by the end of the first six, played in Moscow. However, aided by his old friend Ragozin and coach Abram Model, he leveled the score in Leningrad and the match was drawn. When describing the post-match party, Botvinnik wrote that at the time he danced the foxtrot and Charleston to a professional standard.

In his first tournament outside the USSR, the Hastings 1934–35, Botvinnik achieved only a tie for 5th–6th places, with 5/9. He wrote that, in London after the tournament, Emanuel Lasker said his arrival only two hours before the first round began was a serious mistake and that he should have allowed ten days for acclimatization. Botvinnik wrote that he did not make this mistake again.

Botvinnik placed first equal with Flohr, ½ point ahead of Lasker and one point ahead of José Raúl Capablanca, in Moscow&#x27;s second International Tournament, held in 1935. After consulting Capablanca and Lasker, Krylenko proposed to award Botvinnik the title Grandmaster, but Botvinnik objected that &quot;titles were not the point.&quot; However, he accepted a free car and a 67% increase in his postgraduate study grant, both provided by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Heavy Industry.
He later reported to Krylenko that the 1935 tournament made it difficult to judge the strength of the top Soviet players, as it included a mixture of top-class and weaker players. Botvinnik advocated a double round-robin event featuring the top five Soviet players and the five strongest non-Soviet players available. Despite politicking over the Soviet choices, both Krylenko and the Central Committee of the Komsomol quickly authorised the tournament. This was played in Moscow in June 1936, and Botvinnik finished second, one point behind Capablanca and 2½ ahead of Flohr. However, he took consolation from the fact the Soviet Union&#x27;s best had held their own against top-class competition.

In early winter, 1936, Botvinnik was invited to play in a tournament at Nottingham, England. Krylenko authorised his participation and, to help Botvinnik play at his best, allowed Botvinnik&#x27;s wife to accompany him – a privilege rarely extended to chess players at any time in Soviet history. Taking Lasker&#x27;s advice, Botvinnik arrived ten days before play started. Although his Soviet rivals forecast disaster for him, he scored an undefeated shared first place (+6=8) with Capablanca, ½ point ahead of current World Champion Max Euwe and rising American stars Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky, and 1 point ahead of ex-champion Alexander Alekhine. This was the first tournament victory by a Soviet master outside his own country. When the result reached Russia, Krylenko drafted a letter to be sent in Botvinnik&#x27;s name to Stalin. On returning to Russia, Botvinnik discovered he had been awarded the &quot;Mark of Honour&quot;.
Three weeks later, Botvinnik began work on his dissertation for the Candidate&#x27;s degree, obtaining this in June 1937, after his supervisor described the dissertation as &quot;short and good&quot;, and the first work in its field. As a result of his efforts, he missed the 1937 Soviet championship, won by Grigory Levenfish, who was then nearly fifty. Later in 1937, Botvinnik drew a match of thirteen games against Levenfish. Botvinnik challenged Levenfish, writing that Krylenko, angered by Botvinnik&#x27;s absence from the tournament, ordered the match.

Botvinnik won further Soviet Championship titles in 1939, 1944, 1945, and 1952, bringing his total to six. In 1945, he dominated the tournament, scoring 15/17; however, in 1952 he tied with Mark Taimanov and won the play-off match.

== World title contender ==
In 1938, the world&#x27;s top eight players met in the Netherlands to compete in the AVRO tournament, whose winner was supposed to get a title match with the World Champion, Alexander Alekhine. Botvinnik placed third, behind Paul Keres and Reuben Fine. According to Botvinnik, Alekhine was most interested in playing an opponent who could raise the funds. After consulting the nearest available Soviet officials, Botvinnik discreetly challenged Alekhine, who promptly accepted, subject to conditions that would enable him to acclimatize in Russia and get some high-quality competitive practice a few months before the match. In Botvinnik&#x27;s opinion, Alekhine was partly motivated by the desire for a reconciliation with the Soviet authorities, so that he could again visit his homeland. The match, including funding, was authorised at the highest Soviet political level in January 1939; however, a letter of confirmation was only sent two months later – in Botvinnik&#x27;s opinion, because of opposition by his Soviet rivals, especially those who had become prominent before the Russian Revolution – and the outbreak of World War II prevented a World Championship match.
In spring 1939, Botvinnik won the USSR Championship, and his book on the tournament described the approach to preparation which he had been developing since 1933. One striking feature of this was emphasis on opening preparation in order to gain a permanent positional advantage in the middlegame, rather than seeking immediate tactical surprises that could only be used once.
Botvinnik took an early lead in the 1940 USSR Championship, but faded badly in the later stages, eventually sharing fifth place. He attributed this to the unaccustomed difficulty of concentrating in a party-like atmosphere filled with noise and tobacco smoke. Botvinnik wrote to a friendly official, commenting that the champion was to be the winner of a match between Igor Bondarevsky and Andor Lilienthal, who had tied for first place, but had no achievements in international competition. The official&#x27;s efforts led to a tournament for the title of &quot;Absolute Champion of the USSR&quot;, whose official aim was to identify a Soviet challenger for Alekhine&#x27;s title. The contestants were the top six finishers in the Soviet Championship – Bondarevsky, Lilienthal, Paul Keres (whose home country, Estonia, had recently been annexed by the Soviet Union), future World Champion Vasily Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky and Botvinnik – who were to play a quadruple round-robin. Botvinnik&#x27;s preparation with his second, Viacheslav Ragozin, included training matches in noisy, smoky rooms and he slept in the playing room, without opening the window. He won the tournament, 2½ points ahead of Keres and three ahead of Smyslov; moreover, with plus scores in the &quot;mini-matches&quot; against all his rivals.

In June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Botvinnik&#x27;s wife Gayane, a ballerina, told him that her colleagues at the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre were being evacuated to the city of Perm, then known as Molotov in honour of Vyacheslav Molotov. The family found an apartment there, and Botvinnik obtained a job with the local electricity supply organization – at the lowest pay rate and on condition that he did no research, as he had only a Candidate&#x27;s degree. Botvinnik&#x27;s only child, a daughter named Olya, was born in Perm in April 1942.

In the evenings, Botvinnik wrote a book in which he annotated all the games of the &quot;Absolute Championship of the USSR&quot;, in order to maintain his analytic skills in readiness for a match with Alekhine. His work included wood-cutting for fuel, which left him with insufficient energy for chess analysis. Botvinnik obtained from Molotov an order that he should be given three days off normal work in order to study chess.

In 1943, after a two-year lay-off from competitive chess, Botvinnik won a tournament in Sverdlovsk, scoring 1½  out of 2 against each of his seven competitors – who included Smyslov, Vladimir Makogonov, Boleslavsky, and Ragozin. Chessbase regards this as one of the fifty strongest tournaments between 1851 and 1986.

Shortly afterwards, Botvinnik was urged to return to Moscow by the People&#x27;s Commissar for Power Stations, an admirer and subsequent good friend. On his return, Botvinnik suggested a match with Samuel Reshevsky in order to strengthen his claim for a title match with Alekhine, but this received no political support. In December 1943, he won the Moscow Championship, ahead of Smyslov. At the same time, opposition to his plan for a match with Alekhine re-surfaced, on the grounds that Alekhine was a political enemy and the only proper course was to demand that he be stripped of the title. The dispute ended in Botvinnik&#x27;s favor, and in the dismissal of a senior chess official, one of those to have opposed Botvinnik&#x27;s plan, who was also a KGB colonel.
After Botvinnik won the 1944 and 1945 Soviet championships, most top Soviet players supported his desire for a World Championship match with Alekhine. However, the allegations that Alekhine had written anti-Semitic articles while in Nazi-occupied France made it difficult to host the match in the USSR. Botvinnik opened negotiations with the British Chess Federation to host the match in England, but these were cut short by Alekhine&#x27;s death in 1946.

When the Second World War ended, Botvinnik won the first high-level post-war tournament, at Groningen in 1946, with 14½ points from nineteen games, ½ point ahead of former World Champion Max Euwe and two ahead of Smyslov. He and Euwe both struggled in the last few rounds, and Botvinnik had a narrow escape against Euwe, who he acknowledged had always been a difficult opponent for him. This was Botvinnik&#x27;s first outright victory in a tournament outside the Soviet Union.

Botvinnik also won the very strong Mikhail Chigorin Memorial tournament held at Moscow 1947.

== World Champion ==
Botvinnik strongly influenced the design of the system which would be used for World Championship competition from 1948 to 1963. Viktor Baturinsky wrote: &quot;Now came Botvinnik&#x27;s turn to defend his title in accordance with the new qualifying system which he himself had outlined in 1946.&quot; (This statement referred to Botvinnik&#x27;s 1951 title defence.)

On the basis of his strong results during and just after World War II, Botvinnik was one of five players to contest the 1948 World Chess Championship, which was held at The Hague and Moscow. He won the 1948 tournament convincingly—with a score of 14/20, three points clear—becoming the sixth World Champion. While he was on vacation in Riga after the tournament, an eleven-year-old boy called Mikhail Tal paid a visit, hoping to play a game against the new champion. Tal was met by Botvinnik&#x27;s wife, who said the champion was asleep, and that she had made him take a rest from chess. In 1950, Botvinnik was one of the inaugural recipients of the international grandmaster title from FIDE.

Botvinnik held the world title, with two brief interruptions, for the next fifteen years, during which he played seven world championship matches. In 1951, he drew with David Bronstein over 24 games in Moscow, +5−5=14, keeping the world title, but it was a struggle for Botvinnik, who won the second-last game and drew the last in order to tie the match. In 1954, he drew with Vasily Smyslov over 24 games in Moscow, +7−7=10, again retaining the title. In 1957, he lost to Smyslov by 9½–12½ in Moscow, but the rules then in force allowed him a rematch without having to go through the Candidates&#x27; Tournament, and in 1958 he won the rematch in Moscow; Smyslov said his health was poor during the return match. In 1960, Botvinnik was convincingly beaten 8½–12½ at Moscow by Tal, now 23 years old, but again exercised his right to a rematch in 1961, and won by 13–8 in Moscow. Commentators agreed that Tal&#x27;s play was weaker in the rematch, probably due to his health, but also that Botvinnik&#x27;s play was better than in the 1960 match, largely due to thorough preparation. Botvinnik changed his style in the rematch, avoiding the tactical complications in which Tal excelled and aiming for closed positions and endgames, where Tal&#x27;s technique was not outstanding. Finally, in 1963, he lost the title to Tigran Petrosian, by 9½–12½ in Moscow. FIDE had by then altered the rules, and he was not allowed a rematch. The rematch rule had been nicknamed the &quot;Botvinnik rule&quot; because he twice benefited from it.

Though ranking as formal World Champion, Botvinnik had a relatively poor playing record in the early 1950s: he played no formal competitive games after winning the 1948 match tournament until he defended his title, then struggled to draw his 1951 championship match with Bronstein, placed only fifth in the 1951 Soviet Championship, and tied for third in the 1952 Géza Maróczy Memorial tournament in Budapest; and he had also performed poorly in Soviet training contests. However, he lost only five of over thirty games in the two tournaments; three of the four who finished ahead of him in the 1951 championship were future world champions Smyslov and Petrosian and a leading world championship contender (and winner in both tournaments) Paul Keres; and he finished ahead of Petrosian and even with Smyslov in 1952. Botvinnik did not play in the Soviet team that won the 1952 Chess Olympiad in Helsinki: the players voted for the line-up and placed Botvinnik on second board, with Keres on top board; Botvinnik protested and refused to play. Keres&#x27; playing record from 1950 to early 1952 had been outstanding.

Botvinnik won the 1952 Soviet Championship (joint first with Mark Taimanov in the tournament, won the play-off match). He included several wins from that tournament over the 1952 Soviet team members in his book &quot;Botvinnik&#x27;s Best Games 1947–1970&quot;, writing &quot;these games had a definite significance for me&quot;. In 1956, he tied for first place with Smyslov in the 1956 Alexander Alekhine Memorial in Moscow, despite a last-round loss to Keres.

== Team tournaments ==

Botvinnik was selected for the Soviet Olympiad team from 1954 to 1964 inclusively, and helped his team to gold medal finishes each of those six times. At Amsterdam 1954 he was on board one and won the gold medal with 8½/11. Then at home for Moscow 1956, he was again board one, and scored 9½/13 for the bronze medal. For Munich 1958, he scored 9/12 for the silver medal on board one. At Leipzig 1960, he played board two behind Mikhail Tal, having lost his title to Tal earlier that year, but he won the board two gold medal with 10½/13. He was back on board one for Varna 1962, scored 8/12, but failed to win a medal for the only time at an Olympiad. His final Olympiad was Tel Aviv 1964, where he won the bronze with 9/12, playing board 2 as he had lost his title to Petrosian. Overall, in six Olympiads, he scored 54½/73 for an outstanding
74.6 percent.

Botvinnik also played twice for the USSR in the European Team Championship. At Oberhausen 1961, he scored 6/9 for the gold medal on board one. But at Hamburg 1965, he struggled on board two with only 3½/8. Both times the Soviet Union won the team gold medals. Botvinnik played one of the final events of his career at the Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World match in Belgrade 1970, scoring 2½/4 against Milan Matulović, as the USSR narrowly triumphed.

== Late career ==
After losing the world title for the final time, to Tigran Petrosian in Moscow in 1963, Botvinnik withdrew from the following World Championship cycle after FIDE declined, at its annual congress in 1965, to grant a losing champion the automatic right to a rematch. He remained involved with competitive chess, appearing in several highly rated tournaments and continuing to produce memorable games.

Botvinnik retired from competitive play in 1970, aged 59, preferring instead to occupy himself with the development of computer chess programs and to assist with the training of younger Soviet players, earning him the nickname of &quot;Patriarch of the Soviet Chess School&quot; (see below).

Botvinnik&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;K Dostizheniyu Tseli&quot;, was published in Russian in 1978, and in English translation as &quot;Achieving the Aim&quot; () in 1981. A staunch Communist, he was noticeably shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union and lost some of his standing in Russian chess during the Boris Yeltsin era.

In the 1980s, Botvinnik proposed a computer program to manage the Soviet economy. However, his proposals did not receive significant attention from the Soviet government.

During the last few years of his life, Botvinnik personally financed his economic computer project that he hoped would be used to manage the Russian economy. He kept actively working on the program until his death and financing the work from the money he made for the lectures and seminars he attended, despite prominent health problems.

Botvinnik died of pancreatic cancer in May 1995. According to his daughter, Botvinnik remained active until the last few months of his life, and continued to go to work until March 1995 despite blindness in one of his eyes (and extremely poor vision in the other).

== Political controversies ==
The Soviet Union regarded chess as a symbol of Communist superiority, and hence the Soviet chess world was extremely politicized. As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, everything he said or did (or did not say or do) had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.

David Bronstein wrote that Boris Verlinsky had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet Grandmaster title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (as distinct from the then-nonexistent FIDE grandmaster title).

Botvinnik wrote that before the last round of the 1935 Moscow tournament, Soviet Commissar of Justice Nikolai Krylenko, who was also in charge of Soviet chess, proposed that Ilya Rabinovich should deliberately lose to Botvinnik, to ensure that Botvinnik took first place. Botvinnik refused, saying &quot;... then I will myself put a piece &quot;en prise&quot; and resign&quot;. The game was drawn, and Botvinnik shared first place with Salo Flohr.

Botvinnik sent an effusive telegram of thanks to Joseph Stalin after his victory at the great tournament in Nottingham in 1936.

Botvinnik played relatively poorly in the very strong 1940 Soviet Championship, finishing in a tie for fifth/sixth places, with 11½/19, two full points behind Igor Bondarevsky and Andor Lilienthal. With World War II under way by this time, and the strong possibility of little or no chess practice for some time in the future, Botvinnik seems to have prevailed upon the Soviet chess leadership to hold another tournament &quot;in order to clarify the situation&quot;. This wound up being the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, which featured the top six finishers from the 1940 event, playing each other four times. After a personal appeal to the defence minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, Botvinnik was exempted from war work for three days a week in order to concentrate on chess preparations. He won this tournament convincingly, and thus reclaimed his position as the USSR&#x27;s top player.
Bronstein claimed that at the end of the 1946 Groningen tournament, a few months after the death of reigning world champion Alexander Alekhine, Botvinnik personally invited Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Max Euwe, Vasily Smyslov, and Paul Keres to join him in a tournament to decide the new world champion, but other evidence suggests that FIDE (the &quot;governing body&quot; of chess), had already proposed a World Championship tournament before the Groningen tournament began, and at this stage the Soviet Union was not a member and therefore took no part in framing that proposal.

Since Keres lost his first four games against Botvinnik in the 1948 World Championship tournament, winning only in the final cycle after the outcome of the tournament had been decided, suspicions have sometimes been raised that Keres was forced to &quot;throw&quot; games to allow Botvinnik to win the Championship. Chess historian Taylor Kingston investigated all the available evidence and arguments, and concluded that: Soviet chess officials gave Keres strong hints that he should not hinder Botvinnik&#x27;s attempt to win the World Championship; Botvinnik only discovered this about half-way through the tournament and protested so strongly that he angered Soviet officials; Keres probably did not deliberately lose games to Botvinnik or anyone else in the tournament.

Bronstein insinuated that Soviet officials pressured him to lose in the 1951 world championship match so that Botvinnik would keep the title, but comments by Botvinnik&#x27;s second, Salo Flohr, and Botvinnik&#x27;s own annotations to the critical 23rd game indicate that Botvinnik knew of no such plot.

In 1956, FIDE changed the world championship rules so that a defeated champion would have the right to a return match. Yuri Averbakh alleged that this was done at the urging of the two Soviet representatives in FIDE, who were personal friends of Botvinnik. Averbakh also claims that Botvinnik&#x27;s friends were behind FIDE&#x27;s decision in 1956 to limit the number of players from the same country that could compete in the Candidates Tournament, and that this was to Botvinnik&#x27;s advantage as it reduced the number of Soviet players he might have to meet in the title match.

Botvinnik asked to be allowed to play in the 1956 Candidates Tournament, as he wanted to use the event as part of his warm-up for the next year&#x27;s title match, but his request was refused.

Mikhail Tal&#x27;s chronic kidney problems contributed to his defeat in his 1961 return match with Botvinnik, and his doctors in Riga advised that he should postpone the match for health reasons. Averbakh claimed that Botvinnik would agree to a postponement only if Tal was certified unfit by &quot;Moscow&quot; doctors, and that Tal then decided to play. The 1961 world championship lasted 21 games and Botvinnik won ten of them, for a total score of +10−5=6, reclaiming the title he had lost a year earlier and becoming the oldest winner of a FIDE world championship match at 50.

In 1963, Botvinnik played his last world championship match against Tigran Petrosian, in a 22-game series. Petrosian, almost 20 years younger, wore out the 52 year old Botvinnik in a series of protracted games, most of them over 40 moves, including six consecutive draws. The defending champion played poorly in games 18 and 19, and the match ended with three short draws. Petrosian thus claimed the world championship with a score of +5−2=15.

In 1954, he wrote an article about inciting socialist revolution in western countries, aiming to spread communism without a third world war. And in 1960 Botvinnik wrote a letter to the Soviet Government proposing economic reforms that were contrary to party policy.

In 1976, Soviet grandmasters were asked to sign a letter condemning Viktor Korchnoi as a &quot;traitor&quot; after Korchnoi defected. Botvinnik evaded this &quot;request&quot; by saying that he wanted to write his own letter denouncing Korchnoi. By this time, however, his importance had waned and officials would not give him this &quot;privilege&quot;, so Botvinnik&#x27;s name did not appear on the group letter – an outcome Botvinnik may have foreseen. Bronstein and Boris Spassky openly refused to sign the letter.

== Assessment ==

=== Playing strength and style ===

Reuben Fine, writing in 1976, observed that Botvinnik was at or near the top of the chess world for thirty years—from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian—&quot;a feat equaled historically only by Emanuel Lasker and Wilhelm Steinitz&quot;. The statistical rating system used in Raymond Keene and Nathan Divinsky&#x27;s book &quot;Warriors of the Mind&quot; concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov and Bobby Fischer but ahead of José Raúl Capablanca, Lasker, Viktor Korchnoi, Boris Spassky, Vasily Smyslov and Tigran Petrosian. The Chessmetrics system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players&#x27; best individual years (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935–1949 in Botvinnik&#x27;s case). In 2005, Chessmetrics&#x27; creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of &quot;world number one&quot; players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results). FIDE did not adopt the Elo rating system until 1970, by which time Botvinnik&#x27;s strength had been declining for several years. According to unofficial calculations by Arpad Elo, Botvinnik was the highest-rated player from 1937 to 1954, peaking about 2730 in 1946.

This may seem surprising in the light of Botvinnik&#x27;s results in the 1950s and early 1960s, when he failed to win a world championship match outright (as reigning champion) and his tournament results were patchy. But after the FIDE world championship cycle was established in 1948, reigning champions had to play the strongest contender every three years, and successful title defenses became less common than in the pre-World War II years, when the titleholder could select his challenger. Despite this, Botvinnik held the world title for a longer period than any of his successors except Garry Kasparov. Botvinnik also became world champion at the relatively late age of 37, because World War II brought international competition to a virtual halt for six years; and he was 52 years old when he finally lost his title (only Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker were older when they were defeated). Botvinnik&#x27;s best years were from 1935 to 1946; during that period he dominated Soviet chess; and the USSR&#x27;s 15½–4½ win in the 1945 radio match against the US proved that the USSR&#x27;s top players were considerably better than those from the US (who had dominated international team competitions in the 1930s).


Botvinnik generally sought tense positions with chances for both sides; hence his results were often better with the Black pieces as he could avoid lines that were likely to produce draws. He had a strong grasp of long-term strategy, and was often willing to accept weaknesses that his opponent could not exploit in exchange for some advantage that he could exploit. He confessed that he was relatively weak in tactical calculation, yet many of his games feature sacrifices – often long-term positional sacrifices whose purpose was not to force an immediate win, but to improve his position and undermine his opponent&#x27;s. Botvinnik was also capable of all-out sacrificial attacks when he thought the position justified it. Botvinnik saw himself as a &quot;universal player&quot; (all-rounder), in contrast to an all-out attacker like Mikhail Tal or a defender like Tigran Petrosian. Reuben Fine considered Botvinnik&#x27;s collection of best games one of the three most beautiful up to the mid-1950s (the other two were Alexander Alekhine&#x27;s and Akiba Rubinstein&#x27;s).

Kasparov quotes Tigran Petrosian as saying, &quot;There was a very unpleasant feeling of inevitability. Once in a conversation with Keres I mentioned this and even compared Botvinnik with a bulldozer, which sweeps away everything in its path. Keres smiled and said: &#x27;But can you imagine what it was like to play him when he was young?&#x27;&quot;

=== Influence on the game ===
Botvinnik&#x27;s example and teaching established the modern approach to preparing for competitive chess: regular but moderate physical exercise; analysing very thoroughly a relatively narrow repertoire of openings; annotating one&#x27;s own games, those of past great players and those of competitors; publishing one&#x27;s annotations so that others can point out any errors; studying strong opponents to discover their strengths and weaknesses; ruthless objectivity about one&#x27;s own strengths and weaknesses. Botvinnik also played many short training matches against strong grandmasters including Salo Flohr, Yuri Averbakh, Viacheslav Ragozin, and Semion Furman – in noisy or smoky rooms if he thought he would have to face such conditions in actual competition. Vladimir Kramnik said, &quot;Botvinnik&#x27;s chess career was the way of a genius, although he was not a genius&quot;, meaning that Botvinnik was brilliant at making the best use of his talents.

Botvinnik used almost exclusively pawn openings with the white pieces. In his eight World Championship matches, he never started a game with an e4-opening, and his usual choices as White were the English Opening or Queen&#x27;s Gambit. When playing the black pieces, he preferred the French Defense or Sicilian Defense in response to 1.e4, and the Slav Defense or Nimzo-Indian Defence in response to 1.d4. While Botvinnik did not use a wide range of openings, he made major contributions to those he did use, for example: the Botvinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, the Kasparov/Botvinnik system in the Exchange Variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, the Caro–Kann Defence (both the Panov–Botvinnik Attack for White and various approaches for Black), the Winawer Variation of the French Defense, the Botvinnik System in the English Opening. In his openings research Botvinnik did not aim to produce tactical tricks that would only be effective once, but rather systems in which he aimed to understand typical positions and their possibilities better than his rivals. His advice to his pupils included &quot;My theory of the openings fitted into one notebook&quot; and &quot;You don&#x27;t have to know that which everyone knows, but it is important to know that which not everyone knows.&quot; In fact he used different notebooks in different periods, and copied a few analyses from one notebook to the next. The &quot;Soviet School of Chess&quot; that dominated competition from 1945 to about 2000 followed Botvinnik&#x27;s approach to preparation and to openings research; and, although Soviet players had their own preferred styles of play, they adopted his combative approach and willingness to ignore &quot;classical&quot; principles if doing so offered credible prospects of a lasting advantage.

In 1963, Botvinnik founded his own school within the Soviet coaching system, and its graduates include world champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, and other top-class players such as Alexei Shirov, Vladimir Akopian and Jaan Ehlvest. Botvinnik was not an infallible spotter of chess talent: although he said of the 11-year-old Kasparov, &quot;The future of chess lies in the hands of this young man&quot;, he said on first seeing Karpov, &quot;The boy doesn&#x27;t have a clue about chess, and there&#x27;s no future at all for him in this profession.&quot; But Karpov recounts fondly his youthful memories of the Botvinnik school and credits Botvinnik&#x27;s training, especially the homework he assigned, with a marked improvement in his own play. Kasparov presents Botvinnik almost as a kind of father figure, going some way towards balancing the common public perception of Botvinnik as dour and aloof; and Kasparov inherited Botvinnik&#x27;s emphasis on preparation, research and innovation. Botvinnik was still playing a major teaching role in his late 70s, when Kramnik entered the school, and made a favorable impression on his pupil.

== Other achievements ==

=== Electrical engineering ===
Engineering was as much of a passion for Botvinnik as chess – at Nottingham in 1936, where he had his first major tournament win outside the USSR, he said &quot;I wish I could do what he&#x27;s done in electrical engineering&quot; (referring to Milan Vidmar, another grandmaster). He was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour for his work on power stations in the Urals during World War II (while he was also establishing himself as the world&#x27;s strongest chess player). He earned his doctorate in electrical engineering in 1951. In 1956, he joined the Research Institute for Electrical Energy as a senior research scientist. 
In 1960 he published a book on Asynchronized Synchronous Machines 

=== Computer chess ===
In the 1950s Botvinnik became interested in computers, at first mainly for playing computer chess but he later also co-authored reports on the possible use of artificial intelligence in managing the Soviet economy. Botvinnik&#x27;s research on chess-playing programs concentrated on &quot;selective searches&quot;, which used general chess principles to decide which moves were worth considering. This was the only feasible approach for the primitive computers available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, which were only capable of searching three or four half-moves deep (i.e. A&#x27;s move, B&#x27;s move, A&#x27;s move, B&#x27;s move) if they tried to examine every variation. Botvinnik eventually developed an algorithm that was reasonably good at finding the right move in difficult positions, but it often missed the right move in simple positions, e.g. where it was possible to checkmate in two moves. This &quot;selective&quot; approach turned out to be a , as computers were powerful enough by the mid-1970s to perform a brute-force search (checking all possible moves) several moves deep and today&#x27;s vastly more powerful computers do this well enough to beat human world champions. However, his PIONEER program contained a generalized method of decision-making that, with a few adjustments, enabled it to plan maintenance of power stations all over the USSR. On September 7, 1991 Botvinnik was awarded an honorary degree in mathematics of the University of Ferrara (Italy) for his work on computer chess.

<text>In business, a competitive advantage is an attribute that allows an organization to outperform its competitors.

A competitive advantage may include access to natural resources, such as high-grade ores or a low-cost power source, highly skilled labor, geographic location, high entry barriers, and access to new technology and to proprietary information.

==Overview==
The term &quot;competitive advantage&quot; refers to the ability gained through attributes and resources to perform at a higher level than others in the same industry or market (Christensen and Fahey 1984, Kay 1994, Porter 1980 cited by Chacarbaghi and Lynch 1999, p. 45). The study of this advantage has attracted profound research interest due to contemporary issues regarding superior performance levels of firms in today&#x27;s competitive market. &quot;A firm is said to have a competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential player&quot; (Barney 1991 cited by Clulow et al.2003, p. 221).

Competitive advantage is the leverage a business has over its competitors. This can be gained by offering clients better and greater value. Advertising products or services with lower prices or higher quality piques the interest of consumers. This is the reason behind brand loyalty, or why customers prefer one particular product or service over another. Value proposition is important when understanding competitive advantage. If the value proposition is effective, that is, if the value proposition offers clients better and greater value, it can produce a competitive advantage in either the product or service.

Competitive strategy is defined as the long term plan of a particular company in order to gain competitive advantage over its competitors in the industry. It is aimed at creating defensive position in an industry and generating a superior ROI (return on investment ).

American academic Michael Porter defined two ways in which an organization can achieve competitive advantage over its rivals: a cost advantage and a differentiation advantage. A cost advantage arises when a business can provide the same products and services as its competitors but at a lower cost. A differentiation advantage arises when a business can provide different products and services from its competitors which are more closely aligned to customers&#x27; needs. In Porter&#x27;s view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.

Competitive advantage seeks to address some of the criticisms of comparative advantage. Competitive advantage rests on the notion that cheap labor is and natural resources are not necessary for a good economy. The other theory, comparative advantage, can lead countries to specialize in exporting primary goods and raw materials that trap countries in low-wage economies due to terms of trade. Competitive advantage attempts to correct this issue by stressing on maximizing scale economies in goods and services that garner premium prices (Stutz and Warf 2009).

Successfully implemented strategies will lift a firm to superior performance by facilitating the firm with competitive advantage to outperform current or potential players (Passemard and Calantone 2000, p. 18). To gain competitive advantage, a business strategy of a firm manipulates the various resources over which it has direct control, and these resources have the ability to generate competitive advantage (Reed and Fillippi 1990 cited by Rijamampianina 2003, p. 362). Superior performance outcomes and superiority in production resources reflect competitive advantage (Day and Wesley 1988 cited by Lau 2002, p. 125).

The quotes above signify competitive advantage as the ability to stay ahead of present or potential competition. Also, it provides the understanding that resources held by a firm and the business strategy will have a profound impact on generating competitive advantage. Powell (2001, p. 132) views business strategy as the tool that manipulates resources and creates competitive advantage. Hence, a viable business strategy may not be adequate unless it possesses control over unique resources that have the ability to create such a relatively unique advantage.

Johnson and Foss have provided a formal account of what constitutes an optimal business strategy. According to well-established variational methods, a business pursuing an optimal strategy will follow the shortest economic path that makes the most efficient use of resources. An optimal strategy aligns with the concept of Pareto efficiency.

==The three forms of generic competitive strategy==

Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, wrote a book in 1985 which identified three strategies that businesses can use to tackle competition. These approaches can be applied to all businesses whether they are product-based or service-based. He called these approaches generic strategies. They include cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. These strategies have been created to improve and gain a competitive advantage over competitors. These strategies can also be recognized as the comparative advantage and the differential advantage.

===Cost leadership strategy===

Cost leadership is a business&#x27;s ability to produce a product or service that will be at a lower cost than other competitors. If the business is able to produce the same quality product but sell it for less, this gives them a competitive advantage over other businesses. Therefore, this provides a price value to the customers. Lower costs will result in higher profits as businesses are still making a reasonable profit on each good or service sold. If businesses are not making a large enough profit, Porter recommends finding a lower-cost base such as labor, materials, and facilities. This gives businesses a lower manufacturing cost over those of other competitors. The company can add value to the customer via transfer of the cost benefit to them.

===Differential strategy===

A differentiation advantage is gained when a business&#x27;s products or services are different from its competitors. In his book, Michael Porter recommended making those goods or services attractive to stand out from their competitors. The business will need strong research, development, and design thinking to create innovative ideas. These improvements to the goods or service could include delivering high quality to customers. If customers see a product or service as being different from other products, consumers are willing to pay more to receive these benefits.

===Focus strategy===
Focus strategy ideally tries to get businesses to aim at a few target markets rather than trying to target everyone. This strategy is often used for smaller businesses since they may not have the appropriate resources or ability to target everyone. Businesses that use this method usually focus on the needs of the customer and how their products or services could improve their daily lives. In this method, some firms may even let consumers give their inputs for their product or service.

This strategy can also be called the segmentation strategy, which includes geographic, demographic, behavioral, and physical segmentation. By narrowing the market down to smaller segments, businesses are able to meet the needs of the consumer. Porter believes that once businesses have decided what groups they will target, it is essential to decide if they will take the cost leadership approach or differentiation approach. Focus strategy will not make a business successful. Porter mentions that it is important to not use all 3 generic strategies because there is a high chance that companies will come out achieving no strategies instead of achieving success. This can be called &quot;stuck in the middle&quot;, and the business will not be able to have a competitive advantage.

When businesses can find the perfect balance between price and quality, it usually leads to a successful product or service. A product or service must offer value through price or quality to ensure the business is successful in the market. To succeed, it is not enough to be &quot;just as good as&quot; another business. Success comes to firms that can deliver a product or service in a manner that is different, meaningful, and based on their customers&#x27; needs and desires. Deciding on the appropriate price and quality depends on the business&#x27;s brand image and what they hope to achieve in relation to their competition.

==Core competencies==
Core competencies form the foundation of corporate competitiveness. A core competency is a concept introduced by Prahalad and Hamel (1990). Core competencies fit within the &quot;resource-based view of the firm&quot;. Resources can be tangible or intangible.

A firm&#x27;s knowledge assets are an important intangible source of competitive advantage. For firm knowledge to provide a competitive advantage, it must be generated, codified, and diffused to others inside the organization. Many different types of knowledge can serve as a resource-based advantage, such as manufacturing processes, technology, or market-based assets such as knowledge of customers or processes for new product development. Firms with a knowledge-based core competency can increase their advantage by learning from &quot;contingent workers&quot; such as technical experts, consultants, or temporary employees. Those outsiders bring knowledge inside a firm, such as sharing understanding of competing technologies. Moreover, interactions with contingent workers can provoke the firm to codify knowledge that was tacit in order to communicate with the temporary employees. The benefits of these interactions with outsiders increases with the &quot;absorptive capacity&quot; of the firm. However, there is some risk that these interactions cause leakage or dilution of knowledge assets to others who later hire the same temporary employees. Modern knowledge management theory now suggests that serendipity can be tapped as a strategic advantage for building a core competency. 

The competitiveness of a company is based on the ability to develop core competencies. A core competency is, for example, a specialised knowledge, technique, or skill. Yang (2015) concluded, with the examination of a long-term development model, that developing core competencies and effectively implementing core capabilities are important strategic actions for any enterprise in order to pursue high long-term profits. In the end, real advantage can be created by the management&#x27;s ability to unify corporate-wide technologies and production skills into competencies that capacitate individual businesses to adapt quickly to changing opportunities.

To sustain leadership in a chosen core competency area, companies should seek to maximize their competency factors in the core products like being important in positioning its values, distinctive (differentiated), superior, communicable (visibility), unique, affordable, and profitable. When a company achieves this goal, it allows it to shape the evolution of an end market.

==Corporate identity==
The operational model for managing corporate reputation and image of Gray and Balmer (1998) proposes that corporate identity, communication, image, and reputation are the fundamental components of the process of creating competitive advantage. Corporate identity through corporate communication creates corporate image and reputation, with an end result of competitive advantage.

Corporate identity is the reality of an organization. It refers to the distinct characteristics or core competencies of the organization. It is the mental picture of the company held by its audiences. Corporate communication refers to all the official and informal communication sources, through a variety of media, by which the company outsources its identity to its audiences or stakeholders. Corporate communication is the bridge between corporate identity and corporate image or reputation.

The above-stated process has two main objectives, namely to create the intended image in the minds of the company&#x27;s principal constituents and managing the process to create a favourable reputation in the minds of the important stakeholders. Gray and Balmer (1998) say that a strong image can be built through a coordinated image-building campaign and reputation, on the other hand, requires a praiseworthy identity that can only be shaped through consistent performance.

Positioning is an important marketing concept. The main purpose of positioning is often to create the right perceptions in comparison to competitors. Thus, it creates competitive advantage. This positioning, or competitive advantage, is based on creating the right &quot;image&quot; or &quot;identity&quot; in the minds of the target group. This positioning decision exists of selecting the right core competencies to build upon and emphasize.

==Unfair competitive advantage==
Anti-competitive practices may arise to the benefit of one or more businesses operating within a competitive context, for example in public procurement if one bidder has access to information not available to other bidders.

==Externalities==
Competitive advantages can be reduced by differences between countries in externalities, such as taxes, tariffs or regulations.

<doc id="242424" wikidata="Q581103" url="?curid=242424" title="Volcanic winter of 536">
<text>The volcanic winter of 536 was the most severe and protracted episode of climatic cooling in the Northern Hemisphere in the last 2,000 years. The volcanic winter was caused by at least three simultaneous eruptions of uncertain origin, with several possible locations proposed in various continents. Modern scholarship has determined that in early AD 536 (or possibly late 535), an eruption ejected massive amounts of sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, which reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface and cooled the atmosphere for several years. In March 536, Constantinople began experiencing darkened skies and lower temperatures.

Summer temperatures in 536 fell by as much as below normal in Europe. The lingering effect of the volcanic winter of 536 was augmented in 539–540, when another volcanic eruption caused summer temperatures to decline as much as below normal in Europe. There is evidence of still another volcanic eruption in 547 which would have extended the cool period. The volcanic eruptions caused crop failures, and were accompanied by the Plague of Justinian, famine, and millions of deaths and initiated the Late Antique Little Ice Age, which lasted from 536 to 560.

The historian Michael McCormick has called the year 536 &quot;the beginning of one of the worst periods to be alive, if not the worst year.&quot;

== Documentary evidence ==
The Roman historian Procopius recorded in AD 536 in his report on the wars with the Vandals, &quot;during this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness... and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear&quot;.

In 538, the Roman statesman Cassiodorus described the following to one of his subordinates in letter 25:

* The sun&#x27;s rays were weak, and they appeared a &quot;bluish&quot; colour.
* At noon, no shadows from people were visible on the ground.
* The heat from the sun was feeble.
* The moon, even when full, was &quot;empty of splendour&quot;
* &quot;A winter without storms, a spring without mildness, and a summer without heat&quot;
* Prolonged frost and unseasonable drought
* The seasons &quot;seem to be all jumbled up together&quot;
* The sky is described as &quot;blended with alien elements&quot; just like cloudy weather, except prolonged. It was &quot;stretched like a hide across the sky&quot; and prevented the &quot;true colours&quot; of the sun and moon from being seen, along with the sun&#x27;s warmth.
* Frosts during harvest, which made apples harden and grapes sour.
* The need to use stored food to last through the situation.
* Subsequent letters (no. 26 and 27) discuss plans to relieve a widespread famine.

In the entry corresponding to the year 535–536, the early 7th century Mandaean &quot;Book of Kings&quot; relates, &quot;were you to request a tenth of a peck of grain in the land Gawkāy for five staters, we would look but it would not be found,&quot; an exchange of 873 grams of grain for 43 grams of gold, reflecting the scarcity of grain during this time.

Michael the Syrian (1126–1199), a patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, reported that during 536–537 the sun shone feebly for a year and a half.

The Irish annals recorded the following:
* &quot;A failure of bread in AD 536&quot; – the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;
* &quot;A failure of bread from AD 536–539&quot; – the &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot;
The mid-10th-century &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; record for the year 537:

* &quot;The Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut fell, and there was great mortality in Britain and Ireland.&quot;

In Chinese sources include: 

* The Annals of the Tang Dynasty, which mentions the “great cold” and “famine” that occurred in 536.
* The Book of the Later Han, which describes the “year of great cold” and the “famine that occurred in the summer”.
* The Zizhi Tongjian, a historical text that mentions the “great cold” and the “famine that occurred in the summer”.
* Nanshi 南史 &quot;History of the South&quot; describes &quot;a yellow ash-like substance from the sky&quot;.

Further phenomena were reported by independent contemporary sources:
* Low temperatures, even snow during the summer (snow reportedly fell in August in China, which caused the harvest there to be delayed).
* Widespread crop failures.
* &quot;A dense, dry fog&quot; in the Middle East, China and Europe.
* Drought in Peru, which affected the Moche culture.

There are other sources of evidence regarding this period.

== Scientific evidence ==
Tree ring analysis by the dendrochronologist Mike Baillie, of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, Ireland, shows abnormally little growth in Irish oak in 536 and another sharp drop in 542, after a partial recovery. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica show evidence of substantial sulfate deposits in around 534 ± 2, which is evidence of an extensive acidic dust veil.

== Possible explanations ==
It was originally theorized that the climatic changes of CE 536 were caused by either volcanic eruptions (a phenomenon known as &quot;volcanic winter&quot;) or impact events (meteorite or comet).

In 2015, revision of polar ice core chronologies dated sulfate deposits and a cryptotephra layer to the exact year CE 536 (previously dated to CE 529 before revision). This is strong evidence that a large explosive volcanic eruption caused the observed dimming and cooling, removing the need for an extraterrestrial explanation, but an impact event around this time period cannot be ruled out.

The source of volcanic eruption remains to be found but several proposed volcanoes have been rejected:

* R. B. Stothers postulated the volcano Rabaul in New Britain, in Papua New Guinea. The eruption is now thought to have occurred in the interval CE 667–699 based on wiggle-match radiocarbon dating.

* David Keys suggested the volcano Krakatoa by shifting a cataclysm in CE 416 recorded in the Javanese &quot;Book of Kings&quot; to CE 535. Drilling projects in the Sunda Strait ruled out any possibility that an eruption took place during this time period.

* Robert Dull and colleagues proposed the large VEI-7, Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of the Ilopango caldera. Identification of TBJ tephra in ice cores narrowed the eruption date to CE 429–433.

* Christopher Loveluck and his colleagues proposed Icelandic volcanos based on the shards from a Swiss glacier. However, the cryptotephras dated exactly to CE 536 are geochemically distinct from Icelandic tephra, and the shards in the Swiss glacier have large age uncertainty.

Geochemical analysis of CE 536 cryptotephras distinguishes at least three synchronous eruptive events in North America. Further analysis correlates one of the eruptions to a widespread Mono Craters tephra identified in northeast California. The other two eruptions most likely originated from the eastern Aleutians and Northern Cordilleran volcanic province.

== Historic consequences ==

The 536 event and ensuing famine have been suggested as an explanation for the deposition of hoards of gold by Scandinavian elites at the end of the Migration Period. The gold was possibly a sacrifice to appease the gods and get the sunlight back. Mythological events such as the Fimbulwinter and Ragnarök are theorised to be based on the cultural memory of the event.

A book written by David Keys speculates that the climate changes contributed to various developments, such as the emergence of the Plague of Justinian (541–549), the decline of the Avars, the migration of Mongol tribes towards the west, the end of the Sasanian Empire, the collapse of the Gupta Empire, the rise of Islam, the expansion of Turkic tribes, and the fall of Teotihuacan. In 2000, a 3BM Television production (for WNET and Channel Four) capitalised upon Keys&#x27; book. The documentary, under the name &quot;Catastrophe! How the World Changed&quot;, was broadcast in the US as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; series.

However, Keys and Wohletz&#x27;s ideas lack mainstream acceptance. Reviewing Keys&#x27; book, British archaeologist Ken Dark commented that &quot;much of the apparent evidence presented in the book is highly debatable, based on poor sources or simply incorrect. [...] Nonetheless, both the global scope and the emphasis on the 6th century CE as a time of wide-ranging change are notable, and the book contains some obscure information that will be new to many. However, it fails to demonstrate its central thesis and does not offer a convincing explanation for the many changes discussed&quot;.

The philologist Andrew Breeze argues that some Arthurian events, including the Battle of Camlann, are historical, happening in 537 as a consequence of the famine associated with the climate change of the previous year.

Historian Robert Bruton argues that this catastrophe played a role in the decline of the Roman Empire.

<text>Single malt whisky is malt whisky from a single distillery.

Single malts are typically associated with single malt Scotch, though they are also produced in various other countries. Under the United Kingdom&#x27;s Scotch Whisky Regulations, a &quot;Single Malt Scotch Whisky&quot; must be made exclusively from malted barley (although the addition of E150A caramel colouring is allowed), must be distilled using pot stills at a single distillery, and must be aged for at least three years in oak casks of a capacity not exceeding .

American whiskey has mostly copied the Scottish formula: &quot;The adopted criteria for American single malt whisky specify that the product be a type of whisky that is mashed, distilled, and aged in the United States; is distilled entirely at one U.S. distillery; is distilled to a proof of 160 or less; is distilled from a fermented mash of 100 percent malted barley; is stored in oak barrels (used, uncharred new, or charred new) with a maximum capacity of 700 liters; and is bottled at not less than 80° proof. In addition, the criteria allow for the use of caramel coloring as long as its use is disclosed on the product label. The regulation will also allow the use of the term “Straight” for an American single malt whisky that is aged for at least two years.&quot;

==Production==
Barley, yeast, and water are the only ingredients required in the production of (barley-based) single malt whisky.

All single malt goes through a similar batch production process.

There are several types of single malts available from distilleries including single barrel single malts which are the product of a single batch that was stored for three or more years in a single oak barrel. These single-barrel variants afford the opportunity for the consumer to see the influence of different types of storage on the same whisky (e.g., first-use bourbon whiskey barrels, port pipes, etc.). The more common form of single malt is a marrying at the bottling time of various batches that are mixed or vatted to achieve consistent flavours from one bottling run to the next.

===Malting===
Barley is &quot;malted&quot; by soaking the grain in water for two to three days and allowing it to germinate. This process releases enzymes, which convert unfermentable starch (which is insoluble in water and not available for fermentation by yeast) to fermentable sugars. Traditionally in Scotland, germinating seeds were laid on a malting floor and regularly turned. After three to five days, when the optimum amount of starch has been converted to fermentable sugars, germination is halted by heating the seeds with hot air.

Many distilleries once used a kiln to heat the germinated barley. The &quot;pagoda roof&quot; (many now false) that ventilated the malt kiln can still be seen at many distilleries both in Scotland and in other countries. However, most of the distilleries now use commercial &quot;maltsters&quot; to prepare their malt.

In most cases, some level of smoke from a peat-heated fire is introduced during heating to add phenols, a smoky aroma and flavour to the whisky. Some of the more intensely smoky malts have phenol levels between 25 and 50 parts per million (ppm). Islay malts have a reputation for being the peatiest. More subtle malts can have phenol levels of around 2–3 ppm. Entirely non-smoked (non-peated, unpeated) malts are made by the Glengoyne Distillery, which only uses hot air for drying.

===Mashing===
The malt is milled into coarse flour (&quot;grist&quot;) which is made of husks (20%), grits (70%), and flour (10%), to which three courses of hot water are added to extract the sugars.

The extraction is done in a large kettle (usually made of stainless steel) called a &quot;mash tun&quot;. At first, the hot water dissolves the sugars (maltose) and enzymes (diastase) in the grist. Then the enzymes act on the starch left over from the malting stage, continuing the conversion to sugar, and producing a sugary liquid called &quot;wort&quot;. Typically, each batch of grist is mashed three times or so to extract all the fermentable sugars. The first water is injected at about 60 °C, the second portion at about 72 °C and the third and final portion at about 88 °C. The wort from the first two water courses is drained into &quot;washback&quot; vessels for further processing, whereas the third course is retained as the first charge in the next batch.

===Fermentation===

Yeast is added to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of thousands of litres) called a &quot;washback&quot;. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer.

===Distillation===

The wash is then distilled. The wash is heated, boiling off the alcohol, which has a lower boiling point than water; the vapour is collected and cooled to condense it back into a liquid form.

Scottish regulations require single malts to be distilled in pot stills. In other jurisdictions, column stills may be used.

The initial distilled spirit produced by a pot still, known as &quot;low wine&quot; has an alcohol content of about 20 to 30%. The low wines are then pumped into a second still, known as the &quot;spirit still&quot;, and distilled a second (and sometimes a third) time. The final spirit, called &quot;new make spirit&quot;, generally has an alcohol content of 60 to 70%.

===Dilution prior to aging===
Most new-make malt whisky is diluted with water to about 60% alcohol by volume (ABV) or so before it is placed in casks to mature (62.5% is specified as a maximum in U.S. law for making straight whisky). The aged spirit is then diluted with water to reduce it to bottling strength (typically 40-50% ABV). Since large amounts of water are used during the process of whisky production, water supplies are a key factor for the location of any distillery.

===Maturation===

The &quot;new-make spirit&quot; (above 60% a.b.v.), or unaged whisky, is then placed in oak casks to mature and to reduce its alcohol content to expedition levels (40-45% a.b.v.). By law, all Scotch whisky must be aged for a minimum of three years in oak casks, though many single malts are matured for much longer. The whisky continues to develop and change as it spends time in the wood. Typical maturation periods are in the range of 10-15 years; longer periods of twenty years or more occur, but are rare and costly. During the time it spends in the wood, a significant percentage of each cask&#x27;s content will evaporate. The lost part is known as the angel&#x27;s share.

====Reused casks====

The selection of casks can affect the character of the final whisky. Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse casks that previously contained American whiskey, as US law requires several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new oak casks. To ensure the continuity of supply of used oak casks, some Scottish distilling groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon producers for their first use. Bourbon casks impart a characteristic vanilla flavour to the whisky.

Sherry casks are also commonly used. This practice arose because sherry used to be shipped to Britain from Spain in the cask rather than having been bottled, and the casks were expensive to return empty and were unwanted by the sherry cellars. In addition to imparting the flavours of their former contents, sherry casks lend maturing spirit a heavier body and a deep amber and sometimes reddish colour.

Stainless steel shipping containers, however, have reduced the supply of wooden sherry casks, to the extent that the Macallan Distillery builds casks and leases them to the sherry cellars in Spain for a time, then has them shipped back to Scotland.

Other casks used include those that formerly held port wine, madeira, rum or cognac.

===Vatting, dilution, and bottling===

To be called a single malt whisky in Scotland, a bottle may only contain whisky distilled from malted barley and produced at a single distillery, distilled entirely in pot stills. The regulations of other countries may allow malted rye.

If the bottle is the product of malt whiskies produced at more than one distillery, the whisky is called a blended malt or vatted malt, or pure malt. If a single malt is mixed with grain whisky, the result is a blended whisky. Single malts can be bottled by the distillery that produced them or by an independent bottler.

The age statement on a bottle of single malt whisky is the age of the youngest malt in the mix, as commonly the whiskies of several years are mixed in a vat to create a more consistent house style. On occasion, the product of a single cask of whisky is bottled without being vatted with other casks, and released as a &quot;Single Cask&quot; offering. However, it is not always clear what the term &quot;single cask&quot; refers to. At least some producers release vatting of multiple barrels that have been matured together for one final period in a larger single cask as &quot;single cask&quot; whisky.

While cask strength, or undiluted, whisky (sometimes having an alcohol content upwards of 60%) has recently become popular, the vast majority of whisky is diluted to its &quot;bottling strength&quot; - between 40% and 46% ABV - and bottled for sale.

===Chill filtration===
Whisky can be &quot;chill filtered&quot;: chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as &quot;unchillfiltered&quot; or &quot;non-chill filtered&quot;. Unchillfiltered whisky will often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal. This cloudy appearance is aesthetic only and does not negatively impact the spirit.

Generally speaking, single malt whisky that is bottled at a proof ≥ 46% ABV (92 proof) does not turn cloudy when cooled (other whiskies and spirits have differing thresholds). Most retail whiskies are bottled at or near 40% ABV for economic reasons, which has now become a modern custom, and therefore chill-filtering is common.

Unchillfiltered, cask-strength whisky (usually &gt; 60% ABV or 120 proof) is generally regarded as whisky in its &quot;purest form&quot;.

Unlike wine, whisky does not continue to mature in the bottle.

===Additives===
E150A caramel colouring may be added to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling, to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance. No other additives are allowed in Scotch whisky. This contrasts with the rules governing Canadian whisky production, which allows the addition of other flavourings as well as caramel, and with the rules governing American whiskey, which do not allow additives in &quot;straight&quot; whisky. The use of the caramel additive must be disclosed when the whisky is sold in some jurisdictions, although not in Scotland itself.

==History==
Distillation of whisky has been performed in Scotland and Ireland for centuries. The first written record of whisky comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;, where it was written that the head of a clan died after &quot;taking a surfeit of aqua vitae&quot; at Christmas. The production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls: &quot;Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make &#x27;aqua vitae&#x27;&quot;.

Single malt whisky is associated with the Scottish tradition, although there are also Irish single malts and others. Penderyn, the only whisky commercially produced in Wales, is also a single malt.

From the 15th century onwards, whisky was heavily taxed in Scotland, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, Parliament passed an act making commercial distillation much more profitable, while imposing punishments on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. George Smith was the first person to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824.

In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined a design originally created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the &quot;grain whisky&quot; distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market.

However, during the latter part of the 20th century, single malt scotch whisky became more popular, owing thanks to individuals such as George Urquhart, second-generation owner of Gordon &amp; MacPhail, who was described by the whisky expert George McLean as &quot;the father of single malt&quot;, writing in 2001 that &quot;I believe that single-malt whisky would simply not be available today were it not for the work of George Urquhart. When others knew nothing of malt whisky, he was one of the handfuls of people who understood this great Scottish contribution to the pleasures of food and drink&quot;. In recent times, single malt has made up about 26% of the whisky exported to other countries from Scotland; bulk spirits constituted about 5% and the balance has been blended whisky.
Single malt distilleries also exist in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, USA, Wales and Norway.

Single malt is generally perceived to be a premium product. As of 2020 in all markets except Taiwan more blended whisky is sold than single malt whisky.

<text>A blended whiskey (or blended whisky) is the product of blending different types of whiskeys and sometimes also neutral spirits, colorings, and flavorings. It is generally the product of mixing one or more higher-quality straight or single malt whiskey with less expensive spirits and other ingredients. This typically allows for a lower-priced product, although expensive &quot;premium&quot; varieties also exist.

Some examples of blended whiskey include Canadian Club, Canadian Mist, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Seagram&#x27;s Seven, Kessler Whiskey, Hibiki, the various Scotch whisky blends sold under the Johnnie Walker brand, and Ballantine&#x27;s, Grant&#x27;s, Chivas Regal and other Scotch whisky blends.

== Ingredients and uses ==
Higher proof spirits with less time aging are usually much less expensive to produce than straight whiskeys or single malt whiskeys and are often the primary spirits in blends, along with more premium whiskies and other ingredients added for flavoring.

Most cocktails and mixed drinks that contain whiskey are made using economically priced blended whiskeys rather than higher priced whiskeys, primarily because the presence of the other ingredients makes the subtleties of the taste of the whiskey less critical to the overall taste of the drink.

== Age statements ==
Most blended whiskeys do not list an age, although the regulations governing its production in some countries specify a minimum aging requirement. All spirits in a Canadian, Scottish, or Irish whiskey must be aged at least three years, and any age statement refers to the minimum age of the spirits used in the blend. In the United States, the age statement only refers to the minimum age of the straight whiskey — which must comprise at least 20% of the content — used within the blend. As neutral spirits are not considered whiskeys, they do not have to be aged at all for the production of U.S. blended whiskey.

== Other regulations by country ==

=== Canada ===
Most Canadian whiskies are blends. Any grain spirit aged for at least three years in Canada may be called Canadian whisky. Regulations do not specify any distillation limit, although in practice, it differs little from the Scottish and Irish limit of 94.8%, as the purity of neutral grain spirit has a practical limit of approximately that value. Whiskies with a lower distillation proof are also often included for flavor, with rye whisky being characteristically included. Canadian whisky may contain both caramel coloring and flavoring.

=== Ireland ===
Irish blended whiskey is defined by the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as a blend of two or more different whiskey types among the pot still, malt, and grain whiskey categories. Its production usually includes Irish grain whiskey that is produced from a distillate that &quot;is much less intense in flavor when compared to pot still distillates ... at a strength of 94.5% vol.&quot;

=== Scotland ===

Under Scotch Whisky Regulations, &quot;Blended Malt Scotch Whisky&quot; means a blend of two or more single malt Scotch whiskies that have been distilled at more than one distillery; &quot;Blended Grain Scotch Whisky&quot; means a blend of two or more single grain Scotch whiskies that have been distilled at more than one distillery; and &quot;Blended Scotch Whisky&quot; means a blend of one or more single malt Scotch whiskies with one or more single grain Scotch whiskies. The regulations also allow the addition of caramel color, regardless of whether the final product is labeled as blended or not.

=== United States ===
American &quot;blended whiskey&quot; – alternatively labeled as &quot;whiskey – a blend&quot; – must contain a minimum of 20% straight whiskey. Blended whiskey that contains a minimum of 51% straight whiskey of one particular grain type (i.e., rye, malt, wheat, or bourbon whiskey) includes the grain type in its label description (e.g., &quot;blended rye whiskey&quot; or &quot;blended bourbon whiskey&quot;). Spirits containing less than 20% straight whiskey but greater than 5% whiskey of any kind can be labeled &quot;spirit whiskey&quot;.

American &quot;blended whiskey&quot; is not to be confused with American whiskey labeled as a &quot;blend of straight whiskeys&quot;. A &quot;blend of straight whiskeys&quot; is a mixture of one or more straight whiskeys that either includes straight whiskeys produced in different U.S. states or coloring and flavoring additives (and possibly other approved &quot;blending materials&quot;) or both, but &quot;does not&quot; contain neutral grain spirits.

<doc id="242433" wikidata="Q327182" url="?curid=242433" title="Marketing myopia">
<text>Marketing myopia is the tendency of businesses to define their market so narrowly as to miss opportunities for growth. It is suggested that businesses will do better in the long-term if they concentrate on improving the utility of a product or good, rather than just trying to sell their products.

==Origin==
Theodore Levitt postulated that a myopic culture would lead a business to fall due to the short-sighted mindset and the illusion that a firm is in a so-called &quot;growth industry.&quot; Such beliefs lead to complacency and losing sight of what customers want. It is said that myopic managers focus more on the original product and refuse to adapt to the needs and wants of the consumer.

To continue growing, companies must understand and act on their customers’ needs and desires instead of banking on the presumptive longevity of their products. In many cases growth is threatened, slowed or stopped not because the market is saturated but because of a failure of management.

Levitt&#x27;s paper was influential. Some commentators have suggested that the publication of Levitt&#x27;s book marked the beginning of the modern marketing movement. Its theme is that the vision of most organizations is too constricted by a narrow understanding of what business they are in. The book exhorted CEOs to re-examine their corporate vision and redefine their markets in terms of wider perspectives. It was successful because it was, as with all of Levitt&#x27;s work, essentially practical and pragmatic. Organizations found that they had been missing opportunities which were plain to see once they adopted a wider view. For example, several oil companies (which represented one of his main examples in the paper) redefined their business as energy rather than just petroleum. By contrast, when the Royal Dutch Shell embarked on an investment program in nuclear power, it failed to demonstrate a more circumspect regard for their industry.

One reason that shortsightedness is so common is that people feel they cannot accurately predict the future. While this is a legitimate concern, prioritizing customer needs instead of focusing on the product or service. Customer needs are far more static over time. Oil company customers will always need energy, while they may not always need petroleum to fill that need.

There is no such thing as a growth industry, according to Levitt. There are only companies organized and operated to create and capitalize on growth opportunities. Corporate self-deception revolves around four conditions:
:# The belief that growth is assured by an expanding and more affluent population.
:# The belief that there is no competitive substitute for the industry’s major product.
:# Too much faith in mass production and in the advantages of rapidly declining unit costs as output rises.
:# Preoccupation with a product that lends itself to carefully controlled scientific experimentation, improvement, and manufacturing cost reduction.

==Practical exercise==
When industries change, companies can take advantage of a greater scope of opportunities. Levitt&#x27;s work teaches managers to look beyond their current business activities and think &quot;outside the box&quot;. George Steiner (1979) is one of many in a long line of admirers who cite Levitt&#x27;s famous example on transportation. If a buggy whip manufacturer in 1910 defined its business as the &quot;transportation starter business,&quot; they might have been able to make the creative leap necessary to move into the automobile business when technological change demanded it.

People who focus on marketing strategy, various predictive techniques, and the customer&#x27;s lifetime value can rise above myopia to a certain extent. This can entail the use of long-term profit objectives (sometimes at the risk of sacrificing short term objectives).

==New marketing myopia==
The “new marketing myopia” occurs when marketers fail to see the broader societal context of business decision making, sometimes with disastrous results for their organization and society. It stems from three related phenomena: (1) a single-minded focus on the customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders, (2) an overly narrow definition of the customer and his or her needs, and (3) a failure to recognize the changed societal context of business that necessitates addressing multiple stakeholders.
In the “new marketing myopia.” customers remain a central consideration, as in the traditional “marketing myopia.” However, academics that developed the idea of the “new marketing myopia” state that it is essential to recognize that other stakeholders also require marketing attention. For business-to-consumer companies, these other stakeholders (e.g., employees) are sometimes (but not always) customers too.

== Examples ==
There are multiple examples of industries that have experienced little or severe downfall due to marketing myopia. An example of an industry that suffered from marketing myopia is the video rental industry, which was dominated by Blockbuster LLC, an American company, in the early 2000s. Blockbuster failed to adapt to the emergence and popularity of online streaming services, such as Netflix and filed for bankruptcy in 2009.

==Similar terms==

Kotler and Singh (1981) coined the term &quot;marketing hyperopia&quot;, by which they mean a better vision of distant issues than of near ones. Baughman (1974) uses the term &quot;marketing macropia&quot; meaning an overly broad view of your industry.

<doc id="242446" wikidata="Q675366" url="?curid=242446" title="Earl of Lucan">
<text>Earl of Lucan is a title which has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland for related families.

==History==
Patrick Sarsfield was one of the senior commanders of James II (deposed in 1688) in battles in Ireland with William III, which determined the latter&#x27;s takeover with his co-wife, Mary II, of the English, Scottish and Irish thrones (the Glorious Revolution and First Jacobite Wars). In 1691, the deposed King James purportedly created him Earl of Lucan, Viscount of Tully and Baron Rosberry. Like all post deposition titles they have no recognition in UK law.

In 1795, the first legal creation of title was for Sarsfield&#x27;s similarly landowning great-nephew, Charles Bingham, 1st Baron Lucan.

The subsidiary titles associated with the Earldom of Lucan are: Baron Lucan, of Castlebar in the County of Mayo (created 1776), and Baron Bingham, of Melcombe Bingham in the County of Dorset (created 1934). The first is in the Peerage of Ireland, whereas the second is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which allowed Earls of Lucan to sit in the House of Lords after the practice of electing Irish representative peer ceased. The Earl of Lucan also has a Baronetcy (of Castlebar, Co Mayo), created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia (7 June 1634).

The title became notorious when the 3rd Earl, as cavalry commander in the Crimean War, was involved in the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade.

Its notoriety was renewed after the disappearance in 1974 of the profligate 7th Earl. In June 1975, in his absence, a coroner&#x27;s jury found that he had murdered his children&#x27;s nanny, Sandra Rivett. There have been no confirmed sightings of the 7th Earl since his disappearance, and he was declared legally dead for purposes of probate (debts and assets) in October 1999. This was, alone, insufficient to enable his son George, Lord Bingham to succeed to the titles – a death certificate for the 7th Earl was issued in February 2016 under the Presumption of Death Act 2013, and Lord Bingham&#x27;s claim to the Earldom was formally accepted by the House of Lords on 7 June 2016.

The family seats were Castlebar House, near Gorteendrunagh, County Mayo, and from 1803 to 1922 Laleham House in Laleham, Surrey (until 1965 in the former county of Middlesex).

==Bingham Baronets, of Castlebar (1634)==
*Sir Henry Bingham, 1st Baronet (1573–)
*Sir George Bingham, 2nd Baronet (c. 1625–1682)
*Sir Henry Bingham, 3rd Baronet (died c. 1714)
*Sir George Bingham, 4th Baronet (died c. 1730)
*Sir John Bingham, 5th Baronet (c. 1696–1749)
*Sir John Bingham, 6th Baronet (1730–1750) 
*Sir Charles Bingham, 7th Baronet (1735–1799) (created Baron Lucan in 1776, and Earl of Lucan in 1795)

==Earls of Lucan (1795)==
*Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan (1735–1799)
*Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan (1764–1839)
*George Charles Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan (1800–1888)
*Charles George Bingham, 4th Earl of Lucan (1830–1914)
*George Charles Bingham, 5th Earl of Lucan (1860–1949)
*George Charles Patrick Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan (1898–1964)
*Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (born 1934, missing since 1974, presumed dead; death certificate issued 2016)
*George Charles Bingham, 8th Earl of Lucan (born 1967)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son Charles Lars John Bingham, Lord Bingham (born 2020).

<text>The Seven Churches of Revelation, also known as the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse and the Seven Churches of Asia, are seven churches of early Christianity mentioned in the New Testament Book of Revelation. All of them are located in Asia Minor, present-day Turkey.

== Description ==
According to Revelation 1:11, on the island of Patmos in the far east of the Aegean Sea, Jesus instructed John of Patmos to &quot;[w]rite in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&quot; The churches in this context refers to the community or local congregations of Christians living in each city.

== The seven churches ==
The seven churches are named for their locations. The Book of Revelation provides descriptions of each Church.
* Ephesus (Revelation 2:1–7): known for having laboured hard and not fainted, and separating themselves from the wicked; admonished for having forsaken its first love (2:4)
* Smyrna (Revelation 2:8–11): admired for its tribulation and poverty; but for which it is foretold that it will suffer persecution (2:10)
* Pergamon (Revelation 2:12–17): located where &#x27;Satan&#x27;s seat&#x27; is; needs to repent of allowing false teachers (2:16)
* Thyatira (Revelation 2:18–29): known for its charity, whose &quot;latter works are greater than the former&quot;; tolerates the teachings of a false prophetess (2:20)
* Sardis (Revelation 3:1–6): admonished for – in contrast to its good reputation – being dead; cautioned to fortify itself and return to God through repentance (3:2–3)
* Philadelphia (called Alaşehir since 1390; Revelation 3:7–13): known as steadfast in faith, keeping God&#x27;s word and enduring patiently (3:10)
* Laodicea on the Lycus, near Denizli (see Laodicean Church) (Revelation 3:14–22): called lukewarm and insipid (3:16)

== Seven messages ==
The letters follow a common pattern. For example: the Lord first addresses each church and identifies Himself, then defines things that He knows about the church in question. After this, a challenge or reproach is given, followed by a promise. In all seven cases the admonition, &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&quot;, is appended, although sometimes this comes before the promise and sometimes after.

Although the letters differ in length in accord with the needs of each community, all conclude with an appeal to hold fast and to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ.

Some historicists typically interpret the seven churches as representing seven different periods in the history of the Western Church from the time of Paul until the return of Jesus Christ. Scofield states that &quot;these messages by their very terms go beyond the local assemblies mentioned.&quot; He is of the opinion that the letters have a prophetic purpose disclosing the seven phases of the spiritual history of the Church. Other writers, such as Clarence Larkin, Henry Hampton Halley, Merrill Unger, and William M. Branham also have put forward the view that the seven churches preview the history of the global Church.
 Historicism has been criticised by the Eastern Orthodox priest Dimitri Cozby, who writes that historicists take a greatly oversimplified view of church history: &quot;Since dispensationalism is Protestant in origin its &#x27;Church history&#x27; is strictly Western. The dispensations take into account almost nothing of Orthodox history after the period of the early councils which we share with the West.&quot;

==Angels of the churches==
Chapters 2–3 of the Revelation have specific messages for each of the seven angels of the seven churches. The message of each of the seven letters is directed to the angel of the particular church that is mentioned.

Origen explains that these &quot;angels&quot; are the guardian angels of the churches, a view upheld by Henry Alford. But Epiphanius explicitly rejects this view, and, in accordance with the imagery of the passage, explains it as the bishops.

John sees a vision of the Son of man, who walks among seven lampstands and has seven stars in his right hand. states that &quot;The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.&quot; The comparison of a teacher to a star is scriptural.

Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s reason for interpreting angels of the churches as the prelates of the church is that St. John speaks of them as falling from their first charity, which is not true of the angels. Others would say that the falling away relates to the churches, not to the messengers, as each of the seven letters conclude with the words &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&quot;

The Amplified Bible states that Revelation 2:2 through to 3:18, &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are in the singular, referring to the &quot;angel&quot; of each church. Much of what is said is rebuke and admonishment, so if the &quot;angels&quot; are heavenly beings, they may serve in some way as representatives of the sinful people in their churches. Jewish tradition maintained that every nation and individual has a guardian angel, and that when God is about to punish a nation, He first punishes its angel. There is even a story of Michael, the guardian angel of Israel, being rebuked by God for the sins committed in the time of Ezekiel. So the original readers of Revelation might have assumed that the angels here are the guardian angels of the individual churches, sharing responsibility for the actions of the members.

In the New Testament, the Greek word for angels (&quot;&quot;) is not only used for heavenly angels, but also used for human messengers, such as John the Baptist (, , ) and God&#x27;s prophets () C.I. Scofield has noted that &quot;The natural explanation of the &#x27;messengers&#x27; is that they were men sent by the seven churches to ascertain the state of the aged apostle ... but they figure any who bear God&#x27;s messages to a church.&quot;

== &quot;The Seven Churches of Asia&quot; by Alexander Svoboda ==
In 1869, the London publishing firm Sampson Low, Son, and Marston published Alexander Svoboda&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Churches of Asia&quot;. &quot;The Seven Churches of Asia&quot; is divided into three primary sections: an introduction written by English clergyman and Biblical scholar H. B. Tristram, Svoboda&#x27;s personal travel account visiting the Seven Churches sites, and an itinerary detailing Svoboda&#x27;s route. The book also includes twenty full-page photographs of the Seven Churches sites, photographed by Svoboda. These images are the first produced and published photographs of the Seven Churches. Photographs from Svoboda&#x27;s Seven Churches project were exhibited in the rooms of the Arundel Society in London in 1868.

<doc id="242453" wikidata="Q256210" url="?curid=242453" title="Congress of Troppau">
<text>The Congress of Troppau was a conference of the Quintuple Alliance to discuss means of suppressing the revolution in Naples of July 1820, and at which the Troppau Protocol was signed on 19 November 1820.

The Congress met on 20 October 1820 in Troppau (modern Opava) in Austrian Silesia at the behest of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Alexander and Francis I of Austria were present in person; King Frederick William III of Prussia was represented by the crown prince (afterwards Frederick William IV). The three eastern powers were further represented by their foreign policy ministers: Austria by Prince Metternich, Russia by Count Capo d&#x27;lstria, and Prussia by Prince Hardenberg.

Britain objected, on principle, to the suggested concerted action against the Neapolitan Liberals. Therefore, she sent no plenipotentiary, but was represented by Lord Stewart, ambassador in Vienna and the half-brother of the Foreign Secretary at the time, Viscount Castlereagh. France, too, had given no plenary powers to her representatives, though her policy was less clearly defined. Thus, from the very beginning of the Congress, it was clear that a division between the eastern and western powers was growing.

The characteristic note of this congress was its intimate and informal nature; the determining fact at the outset was Metternich&#x27;s discovery that he had no longer anything to fear from the &quot;Jacobinism&quot; of the Emperor Alexander. In a three hours&#x27; conversation over a cup of tea at the little inn he had heard the tsar&#x27;s confession and promise of amendment: &quot;Aujourd&#x27;hui je deplore tout ce que j&#x27;ai dit et fait entre les annees 1814 et 1818 ... Dites-moi ce que vous voulez de moi. Je le ferai&quot;: &quot;Today I deplore everything that I have said and done between the years 1814 and 1818 ... Tell me what you want of me. I will do it.&quot; 

Metternich&#x27;s failure to convert Castlereagh to his views was now of secondary importance; the &quot;free&quot; powers being in accord, it was safe to ignore the opinions of Britain and France, whose governments, whatever their goodwill, were fettered by constitutional forms. In a series of conferences - to which the representatives of Britain and France were not admitted, on the excuse that they were only empowered to &quot;report,&quot; not to &quot;decide&quot; - was drawn up the famous preliminary protocol signed by Austria, Russia and Prussia on 8 November.

==Troppau Protocol==
The main pronouncement of the &quot;Troppau Protocol&quot; is as follows:

&quot;States, which have undergone a change of government due to revolution, the result of which threaten other states, ipso facto cease to be members of the European Alliance, and remain excluded from it until their situation gives guarantees for legal order and stability. If, owing to such alterations, immediate danger threatens other states the powers bind themselves, by peaceful means, or if need be, by arms, to bring back the guilty state into the bosom of the Great Alliance.&quot;

No effort was made by the powers to give immediate effect to the principles enunciated in the protocol; and after it was officially announced the conferences were adjourned. It was decided to resume them at the Congress of Laibach the following January.

The Protocol was greeted with dismay in Britain. While the British Government was reluctant to attack it openly, they found it difficult to answer the Opposition&#x27;s claims that on a literal reading, Russia or Austria were entitled to invade England to oppose her supposed misgovernment of Ireland. &quot;Shall we see a horde of Cossacks encamped in Hyde Park?&quot; asked one Opposition MP.
