<text>Paul Tetsuhiko Kariya (born October 16, 1974) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Known as a skilled and fast-skating offensive player, he played in the NHL for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Colorado Avalanche, Nashville Predators, and St. Louis Blues between 1995 and 2010.

After a two-year career with the Penticton Panthers, in which he was named Canadian Junior A Player of the Year in 1992, Kariya joined the University of Maine&#x27;s Black Bears men&#x27;s ice hockey team. In his freshman year, he received the Hobey Baker Award, while he and fellow Hobey Baker Award finalist Jim Montgomery teamed to lead the Black Bears to the 1993 NCAA title. Selected fourth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks, he joined the team in 1995 and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. During his nine-year tenure with Anaheim, Kariya formed an effective duo with fellow winger Teemu Selänne that helped him to three NHL first All-Star team distinctions, while also finishing as the runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1997. Not an aggressive player, he won back-to-back Lady Byng trophies in 1996 and 1997 as the League&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. Serving as a captain for seven seasons, he led the Mighty Ducks to the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in seven games. After a single-season stint with the Avalanche, reuniting with Selänne, who had previously been traded away from Anaheim, Kariya signed with the Predators in August 2005. He played two seasons in Nashville, setting a team record for points scored in a single-season in 2005–06 (since broken). Kariya then finished his career playing three seasons with the Blues.

Internationally, Kariya represented Canada on numerous stages and at different levels. He won gold at the 1993 World Junior Championships, his second appearance at the tournament. He made his first appearance at the Winter Olympics in 1994 as an amateur, winning silver. Eight years later, he helped Canada win gold at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In between Olympic appearances, he won gold and silver at the 1994 and 1996 World Championships, respectively.

Throughout his NHL career, Kariya struggled with concussions, which eventually forced his retirement in June 2011 after sitting out the 2010–11 season because of post-concussion syndrome. In June 2017, Kariya was voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. His number, 9, was retired by the Ducks on October 21, 2018.

==Early life and education==
Kariya was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents Sharon and Tetsuhiko (T.K.) Kariya. His father, a Japanese-Canadian born in a World War II internment camp at Greenwood, British Columbia, worked as a math teacher. Tetsuhiko died from a heart attack suffered on December 27, 2002. Kariya&#x27;s mother, a Scottish-Canadian, was also a teacher. Coming from an athletic family, his father played rugby with the Canadian national team. Kariya is one of four siblings who play professional sports. Brothers Steve and Martin are also hockey players. His sister, Noriko, played hockey as well, before turning to boxing.

As a teenager, Kariya worked for a summer in construction. At age 16, he left home to play Junior A hockey in Penticton, British Columbia, where he also worked at a clothing store that belonged to the team&#x27;s coach and general manager. Two years later, he enrolled at the University of Maine to join the school&#x27;s hockey team and was a dean&#x27;s list student.

==Playing career==

===Amateur===
Kariya played two seasons of Junior A with the Penticton Panthers of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL), beginning in 1990–91. Recording 45 goals and 112 points over 54 games in his first season, he was awarded the Vern Dye and Bruce Allison Memorial Trophies as the Interior Conference&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) and rookie of the year, respectively. The following season, he improved to 46 goals and 132 points over 40 games and was awarded the Vern Dye Memorial Trophy for a second consecutive year; he was also further distinguished as the Canadian Junior A player of the year.

During his second BCJHL season, in November 1991, he verbally committed to joining the Maine Black Bears of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Hockey East conference for the 1992–93 campaign. Before deciding to join the University of Maine, Kariya also visited and received offers from Boston University and Harvard University for their respective programs, while entertaining offers from several other NCAA teams. He also turned down major junior teams from the Western Hockey League (WHL). His WHL rights originally belonged to the Victoria Cougars before they were traded to the Tri-City Americans in October 1991.

In his first year with the Black Bears, Kariya scored 100 points (25 goals and 75 assists) in 39 games. He was named Hockey East&#x27;s Rookie and Player of the Year, becoming the second player to receive both awards in the same year after Brian Leetch did so with Boston College in 1987. Kariya also received Hockey East first All-Star team honours alongside teammates Jim Montgomery, Chris Imes and Mike Dunham. Nationally, Kariya was recognized with the Hobey Baker Award as the NCAA&#x27;s top player, becoming the first freshman in history to earn the distinction. During the Black Bears&#x27; playoff run, head coach Shawn Walsh heralded him as one of the top three college players all-time. Kariya&#x27;s efforts led Maine to a record of 42 wins, one loss and two ties, en route to the Lamoriello Trophy as the Hockey East&#x27;s playoff champion and the NCAA title as the country&#x27;s top college team.

A top prospect heading into the off-season, Kariya was projected to be selected between second and fifth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. Kariya went on to be chosen fourth overall by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, one of the NHL&#x27;s two expansion teams. In addition to becoming Anaheim&#x27;s first-ever draft pick, he also became the second-highest pick from Vancouver (after Barry Beck was chosen by the Colorado Rockies second overall in 1977). Following his draft, Kariya returned to the University of Maine for his sophomore year as team captain. He had been voted by his teammates for the role, along with defenceman Chris Imes. However, with Imes joining the United States&#x27; national team full-time in 1993–94, Kariya returned as the lone captain. Kariya was also committed to the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics and left the Black Bears in December 1993. Following the Olympics, Kariya chose not to return to Maine, foregoing his remaining college hockey eligibility to turn professional with the Mighty Ducks. He finished the season with seven goals and 41 points over 23 games with the national team, as well as 8 goals and 24 points over 12 games with Maine.

Five years after his tenure with the Black Bears, Kariya was inducted into the University of Maine Sports Hall of Fame, in a ceremony on October 15, 1999. Two years later, in July 2001, Kariya&#x27;s number 9 was retired by the Black Bears.

===Mighty Ducks of Anaheim===

====1994–98====
Upon returning from the 1994 Olympics, Kariya began contract negotiations with the Mighty Ducks in hopes of joining the team for the remainder of the 1993–94 NHL season. However, a deal failed to materialize and there was speculation in the media he would instead play in Europe. It was reported Kariya was seeking a US$12 million contract over five years from the Ducks. As both sides continued contract talks leading up to training camp for the 1994–95 season, Kariya agreed to a three-year, $6.5 million deal on August 31, 1994. The majority of the contract consisted of a signing bonus worth $4.775 million, while the annual base salary was valued at $575,000.

Garnering a great degree of attention from the Mighty Ducks&#x27; fanbase, Kariya&#x27;s first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans watched his first exhibition game. Due to the NHL lockout, resulting from a dispute between players and owners, his regular-season debut was delayed until January 1995 and the campaign was shortened to 48 games. During the suspension, Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton, Ontario, sponsored by the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA).

As NHL play resumed, Kariya made his debut against the Edmonton Oilers. He later scored his first career NHL goal on January 21, 1995, against Winnipeg Jets goaltender Tim Cheveldae. During his rookie season, he played on a line with Stéphan Lebeau and Shaun Van Allen. Early in the campaign, Kariya held the scoring lead amongst NHL rookies, but was later overtaken by Quebec Nordiques centre Peter Forsberg. Playing in 47 games, Kariya finished the season with a team-leading 18 goals and 39 points. Nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s rookie of the year, Kariya lost the award to Forsberg. Despite being edged out, Kariya was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. His play during his first NHL season earned him comparisons to Wayne Gretzky for his vision and Pavel Bure for his speed, while also earning accolades from Gretzky himself.

During Kariya&#x27;s second season, he was chosen to play for the Western Conference in the 1996 All-Star Game, the only Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, in January 1996, he was ranked 14th in NHL scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games. He later replaced the injured Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks on the West&#x27;s starting lineup. Kariya scored a goal and an assist for the Western Conference in a 5–4 loss to the Eastern Conference. Less than a month after the All-Star Game, the Mighty Ducks acquired Finnish winger Teemu Selänne in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets, in a move that was designed to increase team offense. Selänne was immediately placed on Kariya&#x27;s line, and the two wingers formed one of the NHL&#x27;s most high-scoring duos for several seasons. In the last month of the 1995–96 campaign, Kariya achieved the 100-point single-season mark with a goal and three assists in a 5–3 win against the San Jose Sharks on April 7, 1996. A week later, he scored his 50th goal of the season, scoring twice in the final game of the campaign, a 5–2 win over Winnipeg. With seven goals and seven assists over the final seven games of the season, Kariya was named NHL Player of the Month for April. He finished the season with 50 goals and 58 assists for 108 points, tying him with Selänne for seventh overall in NHL scoring. His three overtime goals set a team record. With 20 penalty minutes over 82 games, Kariya won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player and was also named to the season-ending NHL first All-Star team.

Following the 1995–96 season, Ducks captain Randy Ladouceur retired. Kariya was chosen as the third captain in team history, following Ladouceur and Troy Loney. At age 21, he was the youngest active captain in the NHL and remained so until Bryan McCabe became captain of the New York Islanders two years later. 

As the ensuing 1996–97 season began, Kariya was out of the lineup with a pulled abdominal muscle, and missed the first 11 games of the season; he returned to the lineup at the end of October 1996. However, two weeks after his return, he was injured again after suffering a concussion during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 13, 1996, after opposing defenceman Mathieu Schneider hit Kariya in the head with his elbow. While the play was not penalized during the game, Schneider was suspended by the NHL following the game. Kariya missed two games as a result of the hit. Later in the season, Kariya was voted in by fans to the West&#x27;s starting lineup in the 1997 All-Star Game. Joining him on the Western squad were Ducks teammates Selänne and Guy Hebert. During the game, he scored one goal in an 11–7 loss to the East. Returning to club play with the Ducks, he scored the fastest goal to start a game in team history, eight seconds into a match against the Colorado Avalanche on March 9, 1997. Kariya finished the season with 44 goals and 55 assists, one point short of reaching the 100-point mark for the second consecutive year. Limited to 69 games due to his injuries, he still ranked third in NHL point-scoring, behind Selänne and Pittsburgh Penguins Mario Lemieux. His +36 plus-minus rating and ten game-winning goals set Ducks records (the latter mark was tied by Selänne twice in 1997–98 and 2006–07, then broken by Corey Perry&#x27;s 11 game-winning goals in 2010–11). Kariya finished as a runner-up to Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hašek for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player in the NHL, and won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy after recording six penalty minutes during the season. In so doing, he became the fourth player in NHL history to win the award in consecutive years after Stan Mikita (1967 and 1968), Mike Bossy (1983 and 1984) and Wayne Gretzky (1991 and 1992). He was also named to the NHL first All-Star team once more, an honour he shared with Selänne. Playing 11 games in his first NHL playoff season, Kariya had seven goals and 13 points, which ranked first in team scoring.

With his original NHL contract expiring in the off-season, Kariya and the Ducks struggled to agree on a new deal. As a result, Kariya sat out the first 32 games of the 1997–98 campaign. After making $2.1 million the previous season, he was reportedly asking for a three-year deal worth $27 million, while the Ducks countered with five-year, $25 million and seven-year, $49 million contracts. Both sides eventually agreed on a two-year, $14 million deal in December 1997. While the initial year of the contract paid Kariya a pro-rated salary of $5.5 million (it was also agreed in contract negotiations that Kariya would donate $2 million of his first year&#x27;s salary to Orange County charities), the second year of the contract paid him $8.5 million, making him the second-highest-paid player in NHL history (behind Mario Lemieux&#x27;s $11 million salary in 1996–97). During his absence from the Ducks, Kariya trained with the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Due to the contract impasse, he missed an opportunity to play in Japan, as the Mighty Ducks opened the season with a two-game series against the Vancouver Canucks in Tokyo, an effort on the NHL&#x27;s part to attract attention to the sport ahead of the Olympics. In his first game back, he recorded two goals and two assists. During the second period of the contest, he took a team record seven shots on goal.

With several weeks remaining until the start of the Olympics, Kariya suffered another concussion after receiving a cross-check to the face from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Gary Suter during a game on February 1, 1998. Kariya had scored a goal and was standing still at the side of the Blackhawks&#x27; net when Suter hit him. As a result, the Blackhawks defenceman received a four-game suspension from the NHL. There was wide speculation in the media that the incident was an intentional effort to keep Kariya from playing for Canada at the Olympics; Suter and teammate Chris Chelios were both members of the United States&#x27; national team. In the past, Suter was also accused of intentionally injuring Wayne Gretzky during a game between Canada and the United States in the 1991 Canada Cup. Canada general manager Bobby Clarke called the hit a &quot;cheap shot&quot; and publicly echoed the sentiment that Suter wanted to eliminate Kariya from Olympic play. While Kariya was initially expected to recover in time for the Olympics, the injury (his fourth concussion in three years) ultimately sidelined him from the competition, as well as the remaining three months of NHL play. Limited to 22 games in 1997–98, Kariya recorded 17 goals and 31 points.

Following Suter&#x27;s return from suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was reported by Ducks head coach Pierre Pagé to have said he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya&#x27;s injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest.

Suffering from post-concussion syndrome, Kariya experienced headaches and a loss of short-term memory. During his recovery, he was personally encouraged by fellow NHL players Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine, who were also dealing with serious concussions. He was not permitted by doctors to begin training until May 1998. Leading up to the 1998–99 season, Kariya told reporters he was ready to play a rougher style to protect himself from the opposition, including &quot;getting [his] stick up&quot; against oncoming players. He also adopted a helmet with increased protection, featuring extra padding and a tighter chin strap. In a similar effort, the Ducks additionally acquired enforcers Stu Grimson and Jim McKenzie during the off-season. During his recovery, Kariya was outspoken regarding the culture of the NHL regarding excessive physicality, as well as the lack of deterrence. In an article from the &quot;Sporting News&quot;, he commented, &quot;There&#x27;s too much of a lack of respect players have for one another ... If the league wants to stop that kind of conduct, it will have to punish players ... Ten-game suspensions ... and more, have to be brought back to help wake up players.&quot; He also added, &quot;There probably isn&#x27;t a player in the league who hasn&#x27;t had a concussion.&quot;

====1998–2003====
Fully recovered for the start of the 1998–99 season, Kariya returned to NHL play in October 1998. During a 3–2 loss against the Detroit Red Wings in November 1998, he put a team-record 12 shots on goal. Kariya established several other Ducks records in the first half of the campaign, including a 17-game point-scoring streak on home ice that ended on January 15, 1999. He finished with the second 100-plus point season of his career with 39 goals and a personal best 62 assists. His assists total set a Ducks record that stood for ten years until Ryan Getzlaf recorded 66 in 2008–09. He ranked third in point-scoring among NHL scorers, behind Selänne and leader Jaromír Jágr of the Pittsburgh Penguins, while ranking first in the NHL with 429 shots on goal. Ranked sixth in the West, the Mighty Ducks drew the Red Wings in the opening round of the 1999 playoffs. In Game 3, Kariya blocked a shot with his skate, breaking his right foot. Unavailable for Game 4, the Ducks lost to the Red Wings and were eliminated. Prior to his injury, Kariya had a goal and four points over three games. Kariya&#x27;s comeback season following injury was capped off with his third NHL first team All-Star distinction, receiving 47 of the possible 58 first-place votes for the left-wing position from the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association. Kariya was also nominated for the League&#x27;s Bill Masterton Trophy, awarded for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey; he lost to Tampa Bay Lightning forward John Cullen, who attempted to return to the NHL after missing the previous season with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. While Selänne finished as second runner-up for the Lady Byng Trophy, Kariya finished sixth in voting.

Having played the final year of his contract, Kariya agreed on a new three-year deal with the Ducks, reported to be worth between $32 and $33 million, during the ensuing summer. The contract was signed on June 30, 1999, one day before he was set to become a restricted free agent. In the three seasons that ensued, Kariya&#x27;s offensive production decreased, a period that coincided with the Mighty Ducks failing to qualify for the playoffs each year.

During the 1999–2000 season, Kariya&#x27;s younger brother Steve Kariya began playing for the Vancouver Canucks. On December 8, 1999, the Ducks and Canucks met for a contest, marking the first time the brothers played against each other at any level. Steve recorded an assist on the Canucks&#x27; first goal of the game, before being called for a penalty. On the ensuing Ducks power play, Paul Kariya scored to tie the game at a final score of 2–2. Later in the season, Kariya was speared by San Jose Sharks defenceman Bryan Marchment during a game in March 2000. Kariya was not injured on the play, though Marchment received a three-game suspension from the NHL. Kariya finished the season with the third-highest goals total of his career with 42, though his points total dipped to 86. Nevertheless, he ranked fourth in NHL scoring, behind Jaromír Jágr, Pavel Bure and Mark Recchi. In the NHL&#x27;s season-ending awards, Kariya was named to the NHL second All-Star team, having been outvoted for left wing on the First Team by Red Wings forward Brendan Shanahan. He also ranked seventh in Lady Byng voting.

During pre-season play in September 2000, Kariya received a one-game suspension after slashing Minnesota Wild player Aaron Gavey, though he was able to serve the suspension during exhibition play. Several months into the 2000–01 season, Kariya suffered a broken right foot after blocking a shot from Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman Pavel Kubina during a game in December 2000. Missing 15 games, he returned to the lineup in late-January 2001. The Ducks struggled as a team while both Kariya and Selänne&#x27;s paled in comparison to previous years. In March 2001, Selänne was traded to the San Jose Sharks, marking the end of his duo with Kariya. Despite he and Kariya&#x27;s success playing with each other, the Ducks had advanced to the second round of the playoffs just once in their tenure together. While disappointed with the trade, Kariya later commented that with the tandem constituting nearly half of the Ducks&#x27; $39 million payroll, &quot;If [he] were running the business, [he] would have done something too.&quot; Kariya finished the season with 67 points (33 goals and 34 assists) over 66 games. In addition to losing Selänne via trade, Kariya played the majority of the season without centre Steve Rucchin, who was suffering from post-concussion syndrome.

Without Selänne for a full season in 2001–02, Kariya&#x27;s points total continued to decrease. During the opening month of the campaign, he went ten consecutive game without a goal. Nevertheless, at mid-season, he was named to his sixth NHL All-Star Game in January 2002 (although it marked the first time he had been named to the All-Star Game without being voted in as a starter by fans). Kariya played on a line with Mario Lemieux and Joe Sakic (a trio that remained intact two weeks later for the 2002 Winter Olympics) and notched an assist in an 8–5 victory for the North American All-Stars. Shortly thereafter, Kariya played in his 500th career NHL game, against the Philadelphia Flyers, a contest in which he recorded a hat-trick to lead his team to a 5–4 win. Though he finished with a team-leading 57 points over 82 games, the 2001–02 season marked Kariya&#x27;s worst statistical year as a Duck and the third-straight year his points total had decreased. The Ducks also suffered as a team, finishing with the third-worst record in the West. Losing fan support, the team drew the worst attendance in franchise history at home games during the season. During the season, he was often asked by reporters how long he was willing to remain with the Ducks while the franchise floundered. In the Canadian media especially, there was a widespread position Kariya should be moved to a better club.

====Run to the Stanley Cup Finals with the Mighty Ducks====
During the off-season, Kariya became a restricted free agent before re-signing with the Ducks to a one-year, $10 million contract in July 2002. Prior to the signing, the Ducks made two key acquisitions, signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one-year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils. Both acquisitions were made with Kariya&#x27;s input, as well as with the expectation they would play on a line with him. Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season (during which time Kariya played with his usual centre, Rucchin), the trio formed the Ducks&#x27; top line. Despite playing under a defensive system implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock, the arrival of Kariya&#x27;s new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002–03. However, several months into the campaign, his father died of a heart attack. The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks, which he played nonetheless on December 28, 2002. He recorded an assist in a 7–3 loss. At mid-season, Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2003. He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference, as his team beat the East 6–5. While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22-game 1997–98 season, his 56 assists approached a personal best. With 81 points over 82 games, he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time. His efforts helped the Mighty Ducks to the seventh seed in the West, marking the team&#x27;s return to the playoffs for the first time in four years. Matching up against the second-seeded Red Wings in the first round, Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple-overtime winner in Game 1, resulting in a 2–1 Ducks win. Anaheim went on to sweep the Red Wings in four games; Kariya scored his second goal of the series in the deciding game, a 3–2 overtime win. It marked the second time in NHL history a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four-straight games in the first round. The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey, a game in which the Ducks faced elimination, Kariya received a hard open-ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens. Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes, he needed to be helped to the dressing room. Many felt Kariya&#x27;s equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit. Four-and-a-half minutes of playing time later, he returned to the game. Following his return, he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4–1 lead. Anaheim went on to win the game 5–2 to force a Game 7; Kariya finished the game with a goal and two assists. Reactions regarding Stevens&#x27; hit were divided following the game. Kariya told reporters that after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow, while Ducks head coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit. However, the play was not penalized during the game, and Stevens received no subsequent disciplinary measures from the NHL. Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey, the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3–0 score. Over 21 games, Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring (behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora), scoring six goals and 12 points. Much of Anaheim&#x27;s success was predicated on goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère&#x27;s performance, who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Kariya, meanwhile, was often singled out for his lack of consistent impact throughout the playoffs. As the highest-profile player on the Ducks, he drew matchups against opposing teams top defencemen during the post-season, such as Willie Mitchell against the Wild and Stevens against the Devils. He had also played part of the post-season with a separated shoulder.

Game 7 of the Final marked Kariya&#x27;s last game as a Mighty Duck. After nine seasons, he left Anaheim as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in games played (606), goals (300), assists (369), points (669), short handed goals (16) and shots (2,455). His seven seasons as team captain also set a Ducks record. Kariya&#x27;s records for games played, goals, assists and points have since been surpassed by Selänne, who returned to the Ducks in 2005 and remained with the team until his retirement in 2014. Kariya&#x27;s record for most seasons as the Ducks&#x27; captain has been surpassed by Ryan Getzlaf, who was the team&#x27;s captain from 2010 until his retirement in 2022.

===Colorado Avalanche===
Following the Mighty Ducks&#x27; Stanley Cup run, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season. With Kariya requiring a $10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain with the team, general manager Bryan Murray let him go to free agency. Murray went on record saying, &quot;We understand that he is an important player for the franchise... but when you are trying to build a team it&#x27;s hard to have one player at $10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ($40 million range).&quot; It was reported the team had tried negotiating a longer-term deal with a decreased salary, while Murray told media at the time he would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less. With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose (he decided to opt out of his final year, valued at $6.5 million), the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team. Together, they approached the Colorado Avalanche, having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup. On July 3, 2003, the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one-year contracts. In order for the team to afford both players, Kariya took an $8.8 million pay cut from his $10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year, marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history. At $1.2 million, his salary was below the NHL average, ensuring he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season. Selänne, meanwhile, signed for $5.8 million. Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy&#x27;s retirement, which freed up $8.5 million in salary.

Kariya and Selänne joined an already high-powered Avalanche team that included such forwards as Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay. Despite high expectations for the duo&#x27;s reunion, Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado. After beginning the 2003–04 season on a line with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic, Kariya suffered a sprained right wrist in a game against the Boston Bruins on October 21, 2003. After being sidelined for ten games, he returned in mid-November, but re-injured his wrist in his first contest back. Due to the injury, Kariya missed playing against the Ducks for the first time in a home game on November 18. Still recovering a month later, he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim&#x27;s Arrowhead Pond on December 20. Kariya&#x27;s departure from the Ducks drew criticism from his previous team&#x27;s fans. In anticipation of the Avalanche-Ducks game on December 20, Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $1,200 to be given to the favourite charity of the Ducks player who scores the game-winning goal against Colorado. The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $3,000 for scoring the game-winning goal against the Ducks on November 18 (it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams). Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against the Ducks on January 13, 2004, at the Pepsi Center. He scored one goal in a 3–1 win. Later that month, he played his first game against the Ducks in Anaheim on January 30. Booed every time he touched puck, he recorded two assists, as the Avalanche lost 4–3 in overtime. Limited by injuries, Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games. Selänne recorded 32 points, while playing in 78 games. In the final game of the regular season, Kariya injured his right ankle against the Nashville Predators on April 4. As a team, Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks. Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West, they lost in the second round to the Sharks. Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks, recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3–1.

===Nashville Predators===
Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally inactive for the 2004–05 season, using the time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last &quot;a year-and-a-half [or] two years,&quot; as the players and owners agreed on a new collective agreement in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from ten different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Predators general manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as &quot;unquestionably the biggest signing in [the] club&#x27;s history&quot;. He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the NHL&#x27;s failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier NHL-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized NHL rules, stating, &quot;As an offensive player, I&#x27;m going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don&#x27;t go down, I&#x27;m not going to get a call because they are not going to make the call.&quot; Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.

During the Predators&#x27; training camp in September 2005, Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre-season games. Recovering in time for the season-opener, he debuted with the Predators on October 5, 2005, at home against the San Jose Sharks. Early in the game, Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when he touched the puck. Trailing 2–1 in the third period, he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game, en route to a 3–2 win. In his first season with Nashville, Kariya set team records with 31 goals, 54 assists and 85 points. His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore&#x27;s team record set in 2002–03, while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning&#x27;s mark set in 1998–99. In the playoffs, Kariya had two goals and seven points over five games.
Kariya had 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games during the 2006–07 season and led the Predators in scoring for a second-straight year. Kariya had two assists during five playoff games. During the off-season, Predators owner Craig Leipold put the team up for sale; two of the leading candidates to buy the franchise both had plans to relocate the team. With Kariya&#x27;s contract expiring, he chose not to re-sign with Nashville, citing the team&#x27;s uncertain future.

===St. Louis Blues===
On July 1, 2007, Kariya signed a three-year contract worth $18 million with the St. Louis Blues. In similar fashion to his signing with Nashville, his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team&#x27;s first notable free-agent acquisitions in a while (arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991). While the Predators were a team on the rise when he joined them, the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons.

Although Blues winger Jay McClement was in possession of the jersey number 9 upon Kariya&#x27;s arrival in the off-season, he surrendered it so Kariya could retain his usual number. Assigned as an alternate captain for the team, Kariya rotated the position with Keith Tkachuk, and Barret Jackman throughout the 2008–09 season. Kariya debuted with the team on October 4, 2007, registering an assist in a 3–2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. After recording six assists in his first four games as a Blue, Kariya scored his first goal with St. Louis on October 17, 2007, in a 3–1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks. Two months later, Kariya recorded his tenth career NHL hat-trick against the Dallas Stars on December 29, scoring the Blues&#x27; final three goals, including the game-tying marker with ten seconds remaining in regulation. He was stopped in the shootout, however, by Mike Smith as the Stars won the game 5–4. With the hat trick, Kariya reached the 900-point mark in his NHL career. Despite a decrease in offensive production, Kariya tied winger Brad Boyes for the team lead in scoring with 65 points (16 goals and 49 assists) over 82 games. The Blues finished with the second-worst record in the Western Conference with 33 wins and 79 points.

A month into 2008–09 season, Kariya suffered a hip injury after being hit from behind in a game against the Anaheim Ducks on November 5, 2008, tearing muscle fibers near the top of his left thigh. The injury was initially undisclosed at the time and was erroneously reported as having resulted from a blocked shot. At the time of the injury, he had 15 points (2 goals and 13 assists) over 11 games, tying him for sixth in NHL scoring. After nearly two months of recovery, he began practicing with the Blues, but had a setback in late-December; a subsequent MRI exam revealed additional hip damage. Undergoing surgery for a torn acetabular labrum on January 5, 2009, the team listed him as sidelined indefinitely, while Blues president John Davidson told reporters he might be back late that season or the next. The following month, another MRI revealed a torn labrum in the opposite side of his hip, as well, requiring a second surgery. Despite the loss of Kariya, the Blues made the playoffs for the first time since 2004. With the Blues matching up against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, Kariya began practicing with the team in hopes of a comeback for the playoffs. He told reporters he felt &quot;stronger than [he had]… since 1999&quot;. The Blues were swept in four games however, before Kariya could return.

Fully recovered by the start of the 2009–10 season, Kariya made his return to the Blues lineup on October 2, 2009, a game played in Stockholm. He scored two goals in a 4–3 win against the Detroit Red Wings. On March 18, 2010, Kariya scored the 400th goal of his NHL career, against the New York Rangers. A week later, he recorded the 402nd and final goal of his career, in a 3–1 win against the Los Angeles Kings. Kariya played his last NHL game on April 11, 2010, against his former team, the Nashville Predators. With the Blues trailing by one goal in the third period, Kariya helped set up David Backes&#x27; game-tying goal, marking his 25th assist of the season and final point of his career. The Blues went on to lose the game 2–1 in a shootout.

On December 27, 2009, Kariya received the sixth and last concussion of his NHL career, an elbow to the head delivered from behind by Buffalo Sabres&#x27; forward Patrick Kaleta. During what would become Kariya&#x27;s last season in the NHL, the League began expanding their efforts to eliminate hits to the head with new rules and stiffer penalties. NHL officials also began looking to penalize &quot;blindside hits&quot;, defined as a bodycheck against a player from the side, where he cannot see the ensuing player coming. At the time, Kariya called the pending rule changes &quot;long overdue&quot;, adding, &quot;[H]av[ing] been through so much with that… It&#x27;s something that should&#x27;ve been in place years and years ago.&quot;

With his contract expiring in the off-season, Teemu Selänne, who had since returned to the Ducks, was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya. However, on August 27, 2010, on the advice of doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; in an interview with the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, he commented, &quot;The thing I worry about is that you&#x27;ll get a guy who is playing with a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice.&quot;

==International career==
In the summer of 1991, Kariya joined the Canadian Under-18 Selects Team at the Phoenix Cup, the inaugural tournament of what would go on to become the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. Kariya led all scorers with ten points in six games while being named to the Tournament All-Star team. Canada won the silver medal, losing out to the Soviet Union.

The following year, he moved up to the Canadian under-20 team for the 1992 World Junior Championships in Germany. The youngest player on the team, he recorded a goal and an assist over six games as Canada finished in sixth place. Playing in the tournament a second consecutive year in 1993, Kariya improved to two goals and eight points over seven games, ranking second in team scoring behind Martin Lapointe. Helping Canada to a record of six winsand one loss, they tied Sweden for first overall in the standings, but won the gold medal by way of their 5–4 win against them in their second game. The championship marked Kariya&#x27;s first international gold medal and began a streak of five consecutive gold medals for Canada at the tournament. He was named to the Tournament All-Star team, alongside Canadian goaltender Manny Legace and defenceman Brent Tully. Nearly ten years later, TSN held a fan-voted poll on the Internet to select Canada&#x27;s all-time World Junior team. The poll garnered in excess of 350,000 votes with Kariya chosen as one of 13 forwards on the team.

Four months later, in April 1993, Kariya debuted with the Canadian men&#x27;s team in the IIHF World Championships, held in Germany. At 18 years and six months, he became the youngest player in Canadian history to play at the tournament. He scored nine points in eight games as Canada finished in fourth place.

Later that year, in December 1993, Kariya left his college team, the Maine Black Bears, to join the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the start of the tournament, Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites to do well. Playing on a line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved, Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games, helping Canada to a silver medal. Tied with the Czech Republic 2–2 in the quarterfinal, Kariya scored the game-winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians advance. In the gold medal game, Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3–2 in a shootout to Sweden. With a chance to tie the shootout after Swedish forward Peter Forsberg scored, Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo stopped Kariya with a glove save.

Two months later, Kariya joined Team Canada for the 1994 Men&#x27;s World Championships in Italy. He was the lone player on the team to have continued on from the Olympics, as well as the youngest, while playing on a line with Jason Arnott and Brendan Shanahan. During round-robin play, he scored a hat-trick against Austria in a 6–1 win. In the quarter-final, he added a goal and an assist in a win over the Czech Republic. Canada advanced to the final, where they defeated Finland 2–1 to capture the gold medal. It marked the first championship at the tournament for Canada in 33 years. Kariya finished the tournament with a team-high five goals and 12 points over eight games and received Best Forward and All-Star team honours on the latter, he was joined by Canadian goaltender Bill Ranford. With his success at the 1994 Winter Olympics and World Championships, Wayne Gretzky heralded Kariya as the next NHL superstar.

In January 1996, Kariya finished as a runner-up to Wayne Gretzky for the inaugural Jean Beliveau Award, an annual distinction from Hockey Canada for players who have demonstrated &quot;outstanding playing ability and international experience while maintaining the fundamentals of sportsmanship and fair play&quot;. Unlike most annual awards, the distinction did not take into account players&#x27; performances in the prior year, but their contributions on a career basis. The initial three nominees were chosen by a selection committee, while the winner was determined by fan vote. Randy Gregg was the other nominee.

Following his second NHL season, Kariya was named to Canada&#x27;s team for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna. During the round-robin, he scored a hat-trick against the United States, helping Canada to a 5–1 win, qualifying them for the quarter-finals. During their semi-final against Russia, Kariya scored in the shootout to help Canada to a 3–2 win. Advancing to the gold medal game, they lost 4–2 to the Czech Republic. Kariya finished the competition with four goals and seven points over eight games, earning him a spot as Canada&#x27;s lone representative on the Tournament&#x27;s first All-Star team. Over three World Championship appearances, Kariya recorded 28 points (11 goals and 17 assists) over 24 games, which at the time, ranked him at third all-time among Canadian scorers, behind Steve Yzerman&#x27;s 39 points and Marcel Dionne&#x27;s 32.

Prior to the World Championships, Canada also named Kariya to their team for the 1996 World Cup, which was held in August and September. However, Kariya was kept from competing due to a groin inflammation. During a news conference, he called his withdrawal the &quot;biggest disappointment of [his] hockey career&quot;. The World Cup would have marked his first international appearance in a best-on-best tournament, as the competition did not interfere with the Stanley Cup playoffs as the World Championships did. Kariya was replaced in the lineup by New York Rangers winger Adam Graves. Canada went on to finish as runner-up to the United States in the tournament.

In June 1997, Kariya was again nominated for the Jean Beliveau Award, alongside Gregg, but lost to Bobby Orr.

Four years after his first Olympic appearance as an amateur, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, were set to become the first Games in which NHL players could compete in ice hockey. While Kariya was involved in a contract dispute with the Mighty Ducks, causing him to miss the start of the 1997–98 NHL season, Hockey Canada contacted Kariya, asking him to provide a training regimen by December 1, 1997, ensuring that he would be physically ready to play in the Olympics, given his inactivity in the NHL. Before agreeing to a contract with the Ducks in December, he joined the Canadian national team in training. On November 29, 1997, Canadian General Manager Bobby Clarke announced his roster for the Games, which included Kariya. He was the youngest player named to the team, behind defenceman Chris Pronger, who was born six days earlier. Less than a month to go before the start of the tournament, held in February 1998, however, he suffered a concussion, resulting from an on-ice crosscheck to the head from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Gary Suter. The hit received much publicity as Suter, a member of the United States&#x27; national team, was accused by many in the media, as well as Bobby Clarke for targeting Kariya specifically in order to sideline him for the Olympics. He again described the missed opportunity as the &quot;biggest disappointment of [his] career,&quot; adding that he was looking forward to playing in Japan, having family there.

Leading up to the next Winter Olympics, Kariya was chosen as one of eight initial players to Canada&#x27;s roster on March 23, 2001. Playing on the top line with Mario Lemieux, Kariya scored three goals and one assist over six games, tying for fourth in Canadian point-scoring. He registered his first goal of the tournament in Canada&#x27;s second game, a 3–2 win against Germany. His second came against Belarus in the semi-final, qualifying Canada for the gold medal game. Playing the United States in the final, Kariya scored Canada&#x27;s first goal of the game, tying the score at 1–1 in the first period. Canada went on to win 5–2, capturing their first Olympic gold medal since 1952. Canada&#x27;s roster was later inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame under the team category on March 26, 2009, during a ceremony in Vancouver.

Despite Kariya&#x27;s success with Canada at the 2002 Olympics, he had come off the worst statistical season of his career prior to the national team&#x27;s summer development camp in preparation for the 2006 Winter Olympics. His omission was singled out by the media; general manager Wayne Gretzky, who selected the camp&#x27;s participants, explained publicly, &quot;Paul is a great player, but at some point you have to have a cutoff,&quot; while also asserting he had spoken to Kariya personally regarding the situation. After a strong start to the 2005–06 NHL season, Kariya was one of 49 forwards chosen in October 2005 to Canada&#x27;s preliminary list of players to be selected from for the final roster. When the team was announced in December 2005, however, he was not chosen.

During his career, Kariya became involved with Hockey Canada off the ice, as well. In the late 1990s, he joined the organization as a national spokesperson with women&#x27;s team forward Jayna Hefford for the Initiation Program, promoting a safe and positive experience for children first becoming involved with hockey.

==Playing style==
Kariya was known for his skilled and entertaining style of play. An offensive player, he was a fast skater with strong puck handling and passing abilities. Prior to and early in his NHL career, Kariya drew comparisons to Wayne Gretzky. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, American Head Coach Tim Taylor likened his skating and playmaking ability to Gretzky&#x27;s, while Kariya&#x27;s linemate, Chris Kontos, described his on-ice vision as &quot;Gretzky-like.&quot; Canadian head coach Tom Renney heralded him as &quot;think[ing] and play[ing] at a better speed than anybody else,&quot; adding that his teammates &quot;are usually a half-step behind him&quot;. His speed made him particularly adept in international competition, as games were played on a larger ice surface in comparison to the NHL. Following his first NHL goal against Winnipeg, Jets head coach John Paddock told reporters, &quot;[L]ike with Gretzky the puck seems to following him around... It looks like he&#x27;s cherry picking, but he&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s just great instinct.&quot; Kariya himself cited Gretzky, as well as Brett Hull, Jeremy Roenick and Pavel Bure, as players he liked patterning his game after. Kariya was also recognized for his &quot;hockey sense&quot; and the cerebral aspect of his game, which included analyzing the game at a high level. His first NHL coach, Ron Wilson, also once described Kariya as &quot;the hardest-working athlete [he&#x27;s] ever been associated with&quot;.

While recognized primarily as a playmaker leading up to his NHL career, Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers in his first two seasons with the team. During his third NHL season, he commented, &quot;If Teemu [Selänne] had been here right off the bat, then maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have focused so much on shooting.&quot; Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release. In 1998–99, he led the NHL with 429 shots on goal, which at the time was the second-highest recorded total in NHL history. Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability, Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team&#x27;s net.

==Personal life==
During his rookie NHL season, Kariya lived in the Anaheim area with a family that was close friends with Mighty Ducks head coach, Ron Wilson. Following his departure from the Ducks in 2003, he maintained a summer home in Orange County, California. With a background in competitive swimming as a child, he became an avid surfer in the area.

Kariya still resides in California with his longtime girlfriend Valerie, nearby another former Ducks player, Scott Niedermayer. Kariya has maintained a close friendship with Teemu Selänne, and even attended Selänne&#x27;s final regular season game at the Honda Center in 2014. Despite Kariya having only once attended the arena following his retirement, Selänne made sure to invite his old teammate as &quot;he has meant so much to me, all my best years and the chemistry I’ve had with him.&quot; Selänne even went so far to jokingly &quot;threaten&quot; to tie him up and toss him in his trunk of his car, then drive him to the stadium himself if Kariya refused. Paul Kariya was shown on the Jumbotron during the third period, which led to a loud ovation from the home crowd.

As captain of the Mighty Ducks, Kariya made a cameo appearance in Disney&#x27;s &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; movie, which was released in October 1996.

Kariya and Selanne were honored by the Anaheim Ducks during a home game against the Florida Panthers shortly after Kariya and Selanne were inducted into the hall of fame. Players on the ice during warmups wore either Paul Kariya Mighty Ducks jerseys or Anaheim Ducks Selanne jerseys. Ducks team owner Henry Samueli brought up that Selanne&#x27;s jersey retirement banner “looked lonely in the rafters” and told Kariya “they may have to do something about that in the future”.

The Anaheim Ducks retired his number on October 21, 2018, at a ceremony attended by Selanne and Scott Niedermayer.

In 2018, he was the subject of &quot;Surfacing&quot;, a documentary feature on TSN. The segment&#x27;s creators, Matt Dunn, Michael Farber, Brent Blanchard and David Midgley, received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Sports Feature Segment at the 7th Canadian Screen Awards.

<doc id="243730" wikidata="Q1226921" url="?curid=243730" title="Dion DiMucci">
<text>Dion Francis DiMucci (born July 18, 1939), better known mononymously as Dion, is an American singer and songwriter. His music incorporates elements of doo-wop, pop, rock, R&amp;B, folk and blues. Initially the lead singer of the vocal group Dion and the Belmonts, Dion embarked on a solo career, and was one of the most prominent rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, or with the Belmonts and the Del-Satins. He is best remembered for his signature hit songs &quot;Runaround Sue&quot;, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; and &quot;Lovers Who Wander&quot;, among others.

Dion continued making music after his popularity waned in the mid-1960s, and toward the end of the decade he shifted his style with more mature and contemplative songs, such as &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot;. 

During the 1980s, Dion produced several Christian albums, winning a GMA Dove Award in 1984 for the album &quot;I Put Away My Idols&quot;. He returned to secular music in the late 1980s with &quot;Yo Frankie&quot; (1989). Between the mid-2000s and 2024, Dion released seven chart-topping blues albums (three at No. 1). Critics who had dismissed his early work, labeling him as a teen idol, praised his later work and noted the influence he has had on other musicians.

A Grammy-nominated artist, Dion has released over 40 albums, and scored eleven Top 10 hits (including with the Belmonts) on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. In 2002, Dion was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;Runaround Sue&quot;. Recent album awards include: Favorite Blues Album for &quot;New York Is My Home&quot; (2016), Favorite Compilations and Reissues for &quot;Kickin Child: Lost Columbia Album 1965&quot; (2017) and Favorite Blues Album for &quot;Blues with Friends&quot; (2020).

== Early life ==
Dion was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx, New York. He accompanied his father, Pasquale DiMucci (a vaudeville entertainer), on tour as a child. He developed a love of country music, particularly the work of Hank Williams. He was also fond of blues and doo-wop musicians he heard performing in local bars and on the radio. His singing was honed on the street corners and local clubs of the Bronx, where he and other neighborhood singers created a cappella riffs.

== Music career ==
=== Beginnings with the Belmonts (1957–1960) ===
In early 1957, Dion auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, for their short-lived Mohawk Records label. They asked Dion to sing a song which had been arranged by Hugo Montenegro, and recorded featuring Vic Damone doing vocals. At first Dion refused, stating the song would sound like something his old fashioned parents would listen to, but the Schwartzes convinced him to give it a try. The backing vocals were by a group called &quot;the Timberlanes&quot;, whom Dion had never met. The resulting single, &quot;The Chosen Few&quot;, was released under the name &quot;Dion and the Timberlanes&quot;, and became a minor regional hit. In a 2019 interview at &quot;Crashing the Party&quot; (a radio program related to Norton Records in Brooklyn, New York), Dion stated that &quot;The Chosen Few&quot; hit the Top Ten locally in Boston, which enabled him to perform this song on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The kids at the show started screaming during his performance, and gave Dion his first impression of being a record star. In his autobiography, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, Dion explained that he didn&#x27;t know who the Timberlanes were. &quot;The vocal group was so white bread, I went back to my neighborhood and I recruited a bunch of guys – three guys – and we called ourselves Dion and the Belmonts&quot;.

Bob and Gene Schwartz signed Dion&#x27;s friends, the Belmonts: Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano, and Angelo D&#x27;Aleo. The vocal group was named for the Belmont, Bronx neighborhood, with Dion singing as lead. The new group&#x27;s breakthrough came in early 1958, when &quot;I Wonder Why&quot; (on their newly formed Laurie Records) made No. 22 on the U.S. charts. The record was the first release for Laurie Records. Dion said of the Belmonts: 

Their initial hit was followed by &quot;No One Knows&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pity Me&quot;, which also charted the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. This success won a place for Dion and the Belmonts on the ill-fated &quot;The Winter Dance Party&quot; tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), Frankie Sardo and other performers. On February 3, 1959, after playing a concert in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly decided to charter an overnight flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. Dion was invited to accompany him but decided that he would not spend $36 ($382 in 2024) for the flight, as he considered 36 an unlucky number ($36 was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment) and he could not justify the indulgence. The plane crashed, killing all on board: Holly, Valens, Richardson and the pilot Roger Peterson. Dion and the Belmonts continued on the tour, along with Frankie Sardo, while Bobby Vee (then an unknown artist) performed in Holly&#x27;s place at the very next concert. Jimmy Clanton, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian were later added to replace the other now-deceased headliners.

Dion and the Belmonts&#x27; next single, &quot;A Teenager in Love&quot;, was released in March 1959. It eventually reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 28 in the UK. The group&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Where or When&quot;, was released in November of that year, and reached No. 3 on the U.S. charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked into a hospital for heroin addiction, a condition he battled since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful. With musical, personal and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, Dion left the group for a solo career in October 1960. By the time of their breakup, all eight Laurie releases had charted on the Hot 100.

=== Solo stardom and touring worldwide (1960–1964) ===
By the end of 1960, Dion produced his first solo album on Laurie Records, &quot;Alone with Dion&quot;, released in 1961. The single &quot;Lonely Teenager&quot; rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply &quot;Dion&quot;. Follow-ups &quot;Havin&#x27; Fun&quot; and &quot;Kissin&#x27; Game&quot; had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca with a new vocal group, the Del-Satins. The record, &quot;Runaround Sue&quot;, stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK, where he also toured. &quot;Runaround Sue&quot; sold over a million copies, achieving gold disc status.

For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, &quot;The Majestic&quot;, but it was the B-side, Maresca&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK. The 1976 re-release made the UK Top 20.

By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film &quot;Twist Around the Clock&quot;. In 1962, he followed with a string of singles he wrote or co-wrote including &quot;Lovers Who Wander&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Little Diane&quot; (No. 8), &quot;Love Came to Me&quot; (No. 10). He also had successful albums with &quot;Runaround Sue&quot; and &quot;Lovers Who Wander&quot;.

At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records. He was the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that Mitch Miller (its then-A&amp;R director) loathed that particular genre of music. In 1958 Miller dismissed rock entirely: &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is musical baby food: it is the worship of mediocrity, brought about by a passion for conformity.&quot;

Dion&#x27;s first Columbia single, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while &quot;Donna the Prima Donna&quot; and &quot;Drip Drop&quot; (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. Dion also recorded an Italian version of &quot;Donna the Prima Donna&quot; using the identical backup vocals. His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his drug addiction and changing public tastes, especially the British Invasion, saw a period of commercial decline.

=== Belmonts reunion and renewed contract (1965–1968) ===
Following a European tour, Dion returned to the U.S. and was introduced to classic blues by Columbia&#x27;s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot;. These releases, some produced by Tom Wilson with Al Kooper on keyboards, were not commercially successful. Still with Columbia, Dion formed a new group to back him in 1965. The Wanderers were composed of John Falbo on guitar, Pete Baron (Pete Falciglia) on bass, and Carlo Mastrangelo of the Belmonts on drums. They made national appearances on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;, and on &quot;The Lloyd Thaxton Show&quot;. A number of self-penned tracks were recorded and released unsuccessfully as singles, and did not appear in album format until years later. In June 1965, he recorded fellow Columbia Records contemporary Bob Dylan&#x27;s composition &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;, a half-year before Them (featuring Van Morrison)&#x27;s hit version.

In 1966–67, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts, recording the LP &quot;Together Again&quot; for ABC Records. The album was unsuccessful, despite one classic self-penned song, &quot;My Girl the Month of May&quot;. Two singles were released from the LP. While neither charted in the United States, they fared better in the UK. &quot;My Girl The Month of May&quot; entered the Radio London &quot;Fab 40&quot; at No. 9 the week of December 25, 1966. A &#x27;turntable&#x27; hit at London underground clubs like Middle Earth, the disc received a lot of play from pirate radio DJ&#x27;s John Peel and Kenny Everett. The follow-up, &quot;Movin&#x27; Man&quot;, reached No. 17 on the &quot;Radio London&quot; charts on Easter Sunday, March 26, 1967. &quot;My Girl The Month of May&quot; was later covered by English artists Alan Bown in 1967, and Island Records artists The Bunch (featuring Sandy Denny and other members of Fairport Convention) in April 1972. During their brief mid-60&#x27;s reunion, Dion and the Belmonts appeared on the popular &quot;Clay Cole Show&quot; performing &quot;Berimbau&quot; and &quot;My Girl The Month of May&quot;, and occasionally performed at local New York City clubs such as &quot;The Mardi Gras&quot; on Staten Island (April 29, 1967) before disbanding. While Dion&#x27;s career appeared to be nearing an end, he still retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, one of only two rock artists featured on the album cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in 1967.

In April 1968, Dion experienced what he identified as a powerful religious transformation. After getting clean once again from his heroin habit, an experience he documented in his 1970 song &quot;Your Own Backyard&quot;, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract. They agreed on the condition that he record the song &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot;, written by Dick Holler (also the writer of the Royal Guardsmen&#x27;s &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;) in response to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. The success of this song (released by Dion in August 1968 and later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye) which reached No. 4 in the US charts and No. 1 in Canada, resuscitated Dion&#x27;s career. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

=== Mature and Christian music period (1969–1986) ===
For the next few years, Dion&#x27;s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969.

A live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden was recorded on June 2, 1972. It was released as a live album by Warner, titled &quot;Reunion: Live At Madison Square Garden&quot;, the following year. In 1973, Dion and the original Belmonts performed together again, doing a sold-out concert at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. However, no recording of the 1973 reunion was released. This was followed in 1975 by the album &quot;Born to Be with You&quot; produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but was praised by artists such as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who, with the track &quot;Only You Know&quot; being sampled by Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker for his single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Waste Your Time&quot; (from his 2006 solo album &quot;Jarvis&quot;).

In 1978, Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, &quot;Return of the Wanderer&quot;, another commercial failure.

In December 1979, there was a radical spiritual change in Dion, who had become a born again Christian. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian vein, in which he released five albums on the DaySpring Records label, a division of Word Records in Waco, Texas. These albums reflecting his evangelical Christian convictions were &quot;Inside Job&quot; (1980), &quot;Only Jesus&quot; (1981), &quot;I Put Away My Idols&quot; (1983) which charted at No. 37, &quot;Seasons&quot; (1984), &quot;Kingdom in the Streets&quot; (1985) and &quot;Velvet &amp; Steel&quot; (1986). Several singles were successfully released to Christian radio, notably &quot;Still in the Spirit&quot; from &quot;Kingdom in the Streets&quot;.

In 1984, Dion was nominated for a GMA Dove Award (Christian Music Award) for the album &quot;I Put Away My Idols&quot;. He was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Gospel Vocal Performance, Male for the same album.

On September 24, 1985, Dion was a guest on &quot;100 Huntley Street&quot;.

=== Return to secular music and RRHOF induction (1987–1999) ===
In 1987, Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The two disc CD of this concert was released in 2005, featuring concert photos by Dion&#x27;s friend, Michael J. Friedman. This concert helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences.

Dion&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Wanderer: Dion&#x27;s Story&quot;, was co-authored by Davin Seay and published in the late-1980s.

In 1989, DiMucci returned to rock music with the contemporary album &quot;Yo Frankie&quot;, which included appearances by Simon (&quot;Written on the Subway Wall&quot;/&quot;Little Star&quot;), Reed, k.d. lang, Patty Smyth and Bryan Adams. Produced by Dave Edmunds (who also played guitar on the album), &quot;&quot;Yo Frankie&quot; has a sharp sound while never losing sight of Dion&#x27;s soulful, doo-wop voice.&quot; Overall, &quot;the relevant and nostalgic statement from an artist who helped forge rock &amp; roll&#x27;s first wave&quot; found his way back on radio and in music videos during this period (both on VH1 and MTV), as well as touring.

In 1989, Dion was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (RRHOF), with an introduction by Reed. Controversially, when Dion&#x27;s solo induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame occurred, the other original members of the Belmonts (Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano and Angelo D&#x27;Aleo) were not inducted. In a &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine article dated January 3, 2012, it stated: &quot;There was strife between DiMucci and Belmonts members, who were not pleased when DiMucci was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame without them in 1989.&quot;

In 1996, DiMucci joined Scott Kempner and Frank Funaro of the Del-Lords, and Mike Mesaros of the Smithereens, in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was released in 2001, but not widely circulated or promoted.

Dion&#x27;s &quot;The Best of the Gospel Years&quot; was released in 1997.

=== Grammy Hall of Fame and blues success (2000–2019) ===
Dion has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His &quot;Déjà Nu&quot; album in 2000 had him covering Bruce Springsteen, a lifelong fan of Dion. In 2002, he joined Springsteen onstage in Miami, for a performance of &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; from &quot;Dream on Fire&quot;.

In 2002, Dion was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;Runaround Sue&quot;. He continued to perform songs from his albums live, including a concert in 2004 being recorded for release on DVD.

In 2005, Dion released &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. In January 2006, Dion released &quot;Bronx in Blue&quot;, an album of blues and country standards, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. It peaked at No. 2 on the Top Blues Albums chart.

In November 2007, Dion issued a follow-up album titled &quot;Son of Skip James&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on the Top Blues Albums chart.

In October 2008, DiMucci released &quot;Heroes: Giants of Early Guitar Rock&quot;, an album of his covers of early rock and roll songs he considers seminal to the genre. The album includes versions of songs originally recorded by Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Ricky Nelson, Johnny Cash, and many other early rock guitarists.

In October 2009, Dion performed &quot;The Wanderer&quot; with Paul Simon at the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert.

An audiobook and paperback by Dion and Mike Aquilina, titled &quot;Dion: The Wanderer Talks Truth (Stories, Humor &amp; Music)&quot;, was published in April 2011. DiMucci shares stories about The Bronx in the 1950s, how he ended up on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and his travels with Sam Cooke in the Jim Crow South.

Dion released &quot;Tank Full of Blues&quot; on January 24, 2012. It peaked at No. 3 on the Top Blues Albums chart. While touring, Dion performed &quot;Donna the Prima Donna&quot; live in Las Vegas, on April 5, 2015. On July 11, 2015, he held a concert in Westbury, New York. That same year he released the single &quot;New York Is My Home&quot;, again with Simon. The single was followed by the album &quot;New York Is My Home&quot;, released February 12, 2016. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Top Blues Album chart. It was also awarded Favorite Blues Albums.

Dion planned four concerts in the U.S. during early 2016, and was invited as a keynote speaker for the 2016 SXSW in Texas. He spoke on the topic &quot;A Conversation with Dion: Rock&#x27;s Enduring Voice&quot; on March 17, 2016.

Dion appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on April 8, 2016.

In May 2017, Dion released &quot;Kickin&#x27; Child: The Lost Album 1965&quot; from Norton Records, containing songs recorded in 1965 when he was with Columbia Records (but were not previously released). The album was awarded Favorite Compilations and Reissues. 

=== Recent albums with KTBA Records (2020–present) ===
In June 2020, Dion released &quot;Blues with Friends&quot; via Keeping the Blues Alive Records (KTBA), an independent record label created by Joe Bonamassa and Roy Weisman for Dion and other blues musicians to showcase their talents. The album features Van Morrison, Jeff Beck, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen and others (including liner notes by Bob Dylan). A digital album (and a double vinyl record set), Dion released a music video for every song from the album on his website and social media platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube. The album reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Albums chart (9 weeks at No. 1 and 59 weeks total), and No. 4 on iTunes. It also charted in United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Australia.

&quot;American Songwriter&quot; magazine honored Dion&#x27;s &quot;Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America)&quot; as the &quot;Greatest of the Great 2020 Songs&quot;.

Dion also released two Christmas songs in 2020: &quot;Hello Christmas&quot; (featuring Amy Grant) and &quot;You Know It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (featuring Bonamassa). Both songs were co-written with Mike Aquilina. Music videos were produced for both songs.

Dion&#x27;s song &quot;Blues Comin&#x27; On&quot; (with Bonamassa) from &quot;Blues with Friends&quot; was nominated for a 2021 Blues Music Award. The album was also awarded Favorite Blues Album.

In November 2021, Dion released &quot;Stomping Ground&quot; (with music videos), which includes extensive liner notes written by Pete Townshend. Except for a cover of &quot;Red House&quot;, the songs were written by Dion and Aquilina. Multiple guest artists participated on the album, including Springsteen and Patti Scialfa on &quot;Angels in the Alleyways&quot;. The album became Dion&#x27;s second No. 1 blues album.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Dion at number 154 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. On April 24, 2024, he was one of four musicians honored by the Bruce Springsteen Archives &amp; Center for American Music at Monmouth University in New Jersey.

In March 2024, Dion released his third No. 1 blues album, &quot;Girl Friends&quot;. In October 2024, he released a patriotic collaboration with Carlene Carter, titled &quot;An American Hero&quot; (along with music videos for singles from the album).

== &quot;The Wanderer&quot; musical ==
In October 2011, an industry-only reading of a new play about Dion&#x27;s life was performed in New York City.

In a December 2011 article from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dion and his collaborator (writer and director Charles Messina) discussed details about the project – titled &quot;The Wanderer: The Life and Music of Dion&quot; – which would focus on the years between 1957 until the late-1960s. It was planned to feature more than twenty songs from that era, as well as new original music. In the article, Dion gave his perspective on the story: &quot;You know, I always saw my story as a young &quot;Sopranos&quot; with great music and a Rocky Graziano &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; ending. It&#x27;s a story of redemption. A rock and roll redemption story!&quot;

DiMucci revealed that Michael Wartella would be starring in &quot;The Wanderer&quot; on December 16, 2017. There was a reading of the musical in November 2017, while working on the play continued (with Dion posting about the musical via his Instagram account @diondimucciofficial). In December 2019, it was announced that New Kids on the Block member Joey McIntyre would star as Johnny, Michael Wartella as Dion and Christy Altomare as wife Susan. The first performance at the Paper Mill Playhouse was scheduled to start on May 28, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening performance was rescheduled to March 24, 2022.

In April 2022, Dion appeared in an interview on EWTN&#x27;s &quot;The World Over&quot; with Raymond Arroyo. They discussed his career, his recent blues albums and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; musical.

== Personal life ==
Dion has been married to Susan Butterfield since March 25, 1963. Their first daughter, Tane DiMucci, was born in 1966. Originally from New York City, they moved to Boca Raton, Florida in 1968. Dion and Susan DiMucci&#x27;s second daughter, Lark, was born circa 1969. Their youngest daughter, August, was born circa 1974. His three daughters made him a grandparent.

In the late 1990s, Dion visited his old Bronx parish, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and returned to Catholicism. Sparking Dion&#x27;s reversion to Catholicism was &quot;a chance viewing of &quot;The Journey Home&quot; program on EWTN.&quot; As a practicing Roman Catholic and having struggled with a heroin addiction during his youth, Dion has been involved in prison religion, reaching out to men going through drug recovery. In 2009 he traced his detour into drugs and alcohol to the aftermath of the Buddy Holly plane crash: &quot;You know they didn&#x27;t have grief counseling in the Bronx. So what did I do? I drank, I took a little of this drug, a little of that drug... I tried to avoid the pain in so many ways, or the frustration or the confusion.&quot;

DiMucci was a member of the American board of directors for Renewal Ministries in 2004. He appeared on &quot;The Journey Home&quot; and discussed his wanderings from Catholicism to Protestantism and back again on May 1, 2006. In 2013, he received an honorary degree from Fordham University.

<text>The Trimline telephone is a series of telephones that was produced by Western Electric, the manufacturing unit of the Bell System. These telephones were first introduced in 1965 and are formally referred to as the &quot;No. 220 Hand Telephone Sets&quot;. The Trimline was designed by Henry Dreyfuss Associates under the project direction of Donald Genaro; the firm had produced the previous post-war desktop telephone types for the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company.

==History==
Hand telephone sets in the Bell System were first designed starting with the creation of the handset is 1927. This series of telephone evolved through several designs in the 1920s and 1930s, to refurbishments in the 1950s. They consisted of a table-top handset stand and a wall- or desk-mounted subscriber set that contained the components to connect the telephone to the telephone line, as well as an electromechanical bell ringer.

After the introduction of the Princess telephone line, in 1959, the design motivation for the Trimline series was to create an alternative design that was stylish and easier to use than a traditional telephone. This was accomplished by moving the dial from the telephone&#x27;s base to the underside of the handset, between the earpiece and mouthpiece. The same concept was later used for cellular telephone and cordless telephone models. To miniaturize the rotary dial sufficiently to fit in the Trimline handset, the designers invented an unusual moving fingerstop. Like in the Princess line, the dial was lit when the handset was removed from the base. The Trimline was also one of the first phones to use the predecessor of the now-ubiquitous RJ11 modular phone plug and jack.

Field trials for the first iteration of the Trimline, nicknamed the &quot;Shmoo&quot;, started in 1959 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Based on the trials, Western Electric modified the design several times, ultimately resulting in the Trimline, which was eventually introduced in 1965. The Trimline included a lighted dial and was encased in a sleek, curved molded-plastic housing that took up less space than earlier Western Electric telephones. However, the glass-smooth and shallowly-curved plastic handset proved difficult to retain between cheek and shoulder for hands-free communication without slipping. This problem was never corrected over the life of the model line. Third-party manufacturers offered cushioned clamp-on adaptors to make it easier to cradle the handset, but these add-ons were unsightly.

The first Trimline models used incandescent dial lights powered by a power transformer plugged into a standard electrical outlet. The bulky transformer and the need for a conveniently-placed outlet was criticized by many consumers, but was necessary because of the power demands of the incandescent light bulb. Years later, Western Electric redesigned the Trimline to use a low-power green light-emitting diode (LED) to backlight the dial, which was powered by current from the telephone line, eliminating the need for the transformer. Always eager to re-use its older stocks of turned-in rental phones, AT&amp;T later repainted and sold early-model non-LED Trimlines as &quot;non-lighted&quot; models, without a transformer.

==Variants==
The Trimline handset was produced in both rotary dial and Touch-Tone versions. Rotary dial Trimline production began in late 1965 and a Touch Tone keypad was installed in mid-1966. The Trimline base was available in desk-top and wall-mount versions. The handsets and bases were interchangeable. The Trimline was the first US telephone to achieve design recognition in Europe, where it was referred to as the &quot;Manhattan&quot; model or the &quot;Gondola&quot;. Today, similarly designed telephones are sold by many companies. AT&amp;T retained the Trimline name for the later &quot;Trimline III&quot;, a more compact successor featuring squared corners and straight lines.

In the 21st century, Advanced American Telephones produces the Trimline models 205, 210 (based upon original design), and the 265, under license from AT&amp;T.

== Timeline ==
*1959 First customer trials of the &quot;&#x27;Shmoo&quot;, an early Trimline concept design.
*1965 Original Trimline introduced in the winter of 1965. Only rotary dial versions produced that first year, and availability was limited. 
*1966 Touch Tone keypads become available in addition to dial models at mid-year. First touch-tone phones lack pound and star buttons and so only have ten buttons.
*1968 Keypads on Touch Tone models were expanded to 12 keys, adding a pound and a star button to prepare for future functionality not yet available in 1968.
*early 70s The clear plastic button backplate with colored paper backing matching the color of the phone is replaced with an aluminum backplate on the round button Touch-Tone phones. Also at this time, the round handset cords using proprietary connectors are replaced with modern flat modular cords and jacks. On all Trimline phones, the screw cover above the dial changes from reading &quot;Bell System made by Western Electric&quot; to just &quot;Trimline&quot; with a bell logo to the left of the text.
*late 70s A green LED light fed by the phone line power replaces the incandescent lamp, additionally, the Touch-Tone version now sports slightly larger, square keys, as opposed to the earlier small round keys. Also the Touch-Tone version receives an aluminum faceplate behind the keys.
*1983 AT&amp;T begins selling phones, including the Trimline, to the public (as opposed to their previous leasing only policy) through its newly created American Bell, Inc. subsidiary.
*1984 AT&amp;T is divested of its regional operating companies and is prohibited from using the Bell name or logo, so the American Bell brand is dropped and replaced with simply AT&amp;T. All telephone production continues as normal.
**Late 1984 The Touch-tone Trimline phone is heavily modified with the following new features:
***Electronic chirp ringer in the handset, replacing the previous real bell ringer
***Keys are now made of a soft rubber material
***Line switch (switchhook) eliminated from base, moved to top of phone just below the receiver
***Handset screws&#x27; cover no longer says &quot;Trimline&quot;; made smaller in the middle to conform to new switchhook location
***Only one handset-to-jack cord is required for the telephone connection; cord can be tightly secured onto the bottom of the base, which now only exists with no purpose other than as a rest for the handset
*1985 The rotary Trimline is discontinued, and further modifications are made to the touch-tone model:
**Desk or wall convertible, eliminating separate desk and wall models
**Touch-Tone/dial pulse switch, eliminating separate Touch-Tone and rotary models
**Redial and Mute functions
**One cord to connect telephone is eliminated, base-to-handset and base-to-jack cords reinstated
*1986 With the closing of the Western Electric Indianapolis Works, Trimline production is moved overseas to Singapore and China. Minor modifications included:
**Earpiece Volume Control
**Chirp Ringer/ringer loudness switch moved to base of the phone
**Bottom of the base is now made of plastic, with a lead weight inside the base
**Only 1 screw is used to hold the handset together; location of screw and screw cover is moved to below the dialpad
**2220 Trimline is dropped as a model number, replaced by the 210, 220, and 230.
*1993 The Trimline phone is again updated with the following features:
**The soft rubber keys are again replaced with hard plastic keys, similar to the late 70s and early 80s models, but the keys are even larger and rectangular rather than square
**The faceplate behind the keys, aluminum since the late 70s LED conversion is now a dark gray plastic with a matte surface
**Production is moved to Mexico
**Caller ID models, the 250 &amp; 260, are introduced under the Trimline brand. The design shares nothing in common with the 210 model.
*1996 Lucent Technologies is spun off from AT&amp;T, and minor modifications are added:
**Phones are marked &quot;Lucent Technologies&quot;, though this turned out to be temporary, and the boxes and marketing materials were always co-branded with AT&amp;T
**&quot;Trimline&quot; again marked above the dialpad on the matte surface
**Ringer loudness switch is moved back to dialpad; ringer remains inside the base
*1997 Lucent enters a joint venture with Philips, creating Philips Consumer Communications. Shortly after, more changes are made:
**Handset screws are eliminated completely. Handset is only held together by &quot;snap&quot; ends at both ends of the phone, above the receiver and below the microphone.
**Telephones are again branded AT&amp;T; Lucent Technologies branding ends.
**Ringer moved into handset.
*2000 Lucent dissolved the joint venture with Philips in 1998, and sells its consumer division to Hong Kong company VTech, where it becomes Advanced American Telephones. VTech moved all production to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Powered modular jacks for illumination==
In the Trimline version designed for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry low-voltage AC or DC power. While the telephone line supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the line could supply. Typically, the power came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near the telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone, or to all jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices. It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that &quot;might&quot; be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks in other parts of the house. The early Trimline and Princess incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 volts and 0.25 amperes and the transformer output is approximately 6–8 volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric-made Princess version had no dial light.

<text>Arthur Walkington Pink (1 April 1886 – 15 July 1952) was an English theologian.

==Biography==
Arthur Walkington Pink was born in Nottingham, England, to a corn merchant, a devout non-conformist of uncertain denomination, though probably a Congregationalist. Otherwise, almost nothing is known of Pink&#x27;s childhood or education except that he had some ability and training in music. As a young man, Pink joined the Theosophical Society, an occult gnostic group in contemporary England, and he apparently rose to enough prominence within its ranks that Annie Besant, its head, offered to admit him to its leadership circle. In 1908 he renounced Theosophy for evangelical Christianity.

Desiring to become a minister but unwilling to attend a liberal theological college in England, Pink very briefly studied at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago in 1910 before taking the pastorate of the Congregational church in Silverton, Colorado. In 1912 Pink left Silverton, probably for California, and then took a joint pastorate of churches in rural Burkesville and Albany, Kentucky. In 1916, he married Vera E. Russell (1893–1962), who had been reared in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Pink&#x27;s next pastorate was at Scottsville Baptist Church, Scottsville, Kentucky. Then the newlyweds moved in 1917 to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where Pink became pastor of Northside Baptist Church.

By this time Pink had become acquainted with prominent dispensationalist Fundamentalists, such as Harry Ironside and Arno C. Gaebelein, and his first two books, published in 1917 and 1918, were in agreement with that theological position. Yet Pink&#x27;s views were changing, and during these years he also wrote the first edition of &quot;The Sovereignty of God&quot; (1918), which argued that God did &quot;not&quot; love sinners who had not been predestined unto salvation, and that He had deliberately created &quot;unto damnation&quot; those who would not accept Christ. Whether because of his Calvinistic views, his nearly incredible studiousness, his weakened health, or his lack of sociability, Pink left Spartanburg in 1919 believing that God would &quot;have me give myself to writing.&quot; But Pink then seems next to have taught the Bible—with some success—in California for a tent evangelist named Thompson while continuing his intense study of Puritan writings.

In January 1922, Pink published the first issue of &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, which by the end of the following year had about a thousand subscribers and which was to occupy most of his time for the remainder of his life and become the source for dozens of books, some arranged from &quot;Studies&quot; articles after his death. In 1923 Pink suffered a nervous breakdown, and he and his wife lived with friends in Philadelphia until he regained his health. In 1925, the Pinks sailed to Sydney, Australia, where he served as both an evangelist and Bible teacher at the Ashfield Tabernacle. But his impolitic preaching of Calvinist doctrine resulted in a unanimous resolve of the Baptist Fraternal of New South Wales not to endorse him. From 1926 to 1928, Pink served as pastor of two groups of Strict and Particular Baptists.

Returning to England, Pink was invited to preach at a pastorless church in Seaton, Devon; but though he was welcomed by some members, the overseers thought his installation as pastor would split the church. In the spring of 1929, Pink and wife returned to her home state of Kentucky where he intended to become pastor of the Baptist church in Morton&#x27;s Gap. Once again his hopes were unrealized. To a friend he wrote, &quot;I am more firmly convinced today than I was 14 months ago that our place is on the &#x27;outside of the camp.&#x27; That is the place of &#x27;reproach,&#x27; of loneliness, and of testing.&quot; In 1930 Pink was able to start a Bible class in Glendale, California, while also turning down opportunities to speak in some Fundamentalist churches. The following year, the Pinks rented an unpainted wooden house in Union County, Pennsylvania, where a small group met; then in 1933 they moved to York, Pennsylvania.

Pink decided that if his ministry was to be totally one of writing, he could do that just as well in England. In September 1934 he and his wife moved to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, near honorary agents of &quot;Studies in the Scriptures.&quot; Pink seems to have finally given way to despair. To a friend he wrote &quot;that those of my friends who would dearly like to help me are powerless to do so; while those who could, will not. And in a very few years at most it will be too late. What I have gone through the last seven years is so reacting on my physical and mental constitution, that ere long I shall be incapacitated even if doors should be opened unto me. However, I can see nothing else than to attempt to seek grace to bow to the Lord&#x27;s sovereign pleasure, and say, &#x27;Not my will, but thine be done.&#x27;&quot;

In 1936, the Pinks moved to Hove, on the south coast near Brighton. After the death of his father in 1933, Pink received enough of the estate to allow him and his wife to live very simply without financial concerns; and between 1936 until his death in 1952, Pink devoted himself completely to &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;. Vera believed her husband&#x27;s almost unrelenting work schedule unhealthy, and she remarkably succeeded in having him take up stamp collecting as a hobby. In 1940, Hove became a regular target of German air raids, and the Pinks moved to Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, where they remained for the rest of his life. The island was a bastion of Calvinism, but church services were held mostly in Scots Gaelic, and visitors were not especially welcomed in any case. Pink governed his time in study and writing with &quot;military precision.&quot; To a friend he wrote that he went out to shop and get exercise for an hour, six days a week, but that otherwise he never left his study except when working in a small garden. While in Hove, he even published a note in &quot;Studies&quot; advising subscribers that &quot;it is not convenient for us to receive any visitors, and respectfully ask readers who may visit these parts to kindly refrain from calling upon us, but please note that we are always glad to hear from Christian friends.&quot; Rather than attend church, on Sunday mornings, Pink spent time ministering to readers by letter.

In 1951 Vera became aware that Pink was failing. He lost weight and was in pain but refused to take any medicine that might dull his mind and hinder him from completing his work. He died on 15 July 1952. His last words were &quot;The Scriptures explain themselves.&quot; Pink left enough written material to allow publication of &quot;Studies&quot; until December 1953. Vera Pink survived her husband by ten years and after his death made new friends and mingled more freely with others.

==Influence==
It is alleged that Pink&#x27;s personality made it difficult for him to have a successful pastoral ministry. He has been criticized for being too individualistic and of too critical a temperament, lacking the benefit of thorough theological discussions with other men of similar gifts. One young pastor, Rev. Robert Harbach who corresponded with Pink for years remembered a very different Pink, who possessed a &quot;pastor&#x27;s heart.&quot; Pink&#x27;s correspondence with Harbach (until Pink&#x27;s failing health ended their correspondence in 1949) was warm, heartfelt and fatherly. Early in their correspondence, Pink wrote &quot;I want you to feel perfectly free to call on me for any help I may be able to render you. I am in touch with a number of young pastors, and I deem it part of my work, and a privilege, to offer what advice I can.&quot;

Pink&#x27;s acclaimed contemporary D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones received spiritual benefit from reading Pink and recommended him to others. To one young minister, he said, &quot;Don&#x27;t waste your time reading Barth and Brunner. You will get nothing from them to aid you with preaching. Read Pink.&quot; But Lloyd-Jones also said, &quot;If I had behaved as Pink did, I would have achieved nothing. Nothing at all... I had to be very patient and take a very long-term look at things. Otherwise I would have been dismissed and whole thing would have been finished.&quot; Furthermore, without the assistance and companionship of his wife, who dedicated herself completely to him and his work, Pink would have (as he freely admitted) &quot;been overwhelmed&quot; and probably would have achieved little even in writing.

Theologically Pink was rejected during his lifetime because of his opposition to Arminianism; but after his death, there was a major shift of evangelical opinion towards Calvinistic theology. By 1982, Baker Book House had published 22 of Pink&#x27;s books and sold 350,000 total copies. Nevertheless, it was Pink&#x27;s &quot;Sovereignty of God&quot; that did &quot;more than any other in redirecting the thinking of a younger generation.&quot; After Banner of Truth Trust republished it in 1961—modifying it to remove Pink&#x27;s alleged hyper-Calvinism—the book sold 177,000 copies by 2004.

<doc id="243736" wikidata="Q141436" url="?curid=243736" title="Brocchinia reducta">
<text>Brocchinia reducta is a carnivorous plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to southern Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, and Guyana, and is found in areas with nutrient-poor, high moisture soil. &quot;B. reducta&quot; is able to grow in sparse conditions, which is evident when it uses its roots as anchors over rocks. Its funnel-like structure and waxy coating, among other characteristics, suggest that this plant is carnivorous.

== Structure ==
&quot;Brocchinia reducta&quot;, like many other bromeliads, forms a water-storing cup with its tightly overlapping, bright yellow and green leaves, creating a cylinder when growing outdoors called a rosette. The leaves surrounding the cup of &quot;B. reducta&quot; are coated with a very loose yet thick wax coat. This coating is highly reflective of ultraviolet light, which also protects the plant from harmful rays. Since many insects are attracted to ultraviolet (it is also reflected by many flowers), this is an efficient lure. The water in the cup also emits a sweet odor, which may serve to attract ants and other insects. However, several studies have determined that the reflective wax coating serves mainly to cause insects to slip into the water cup below. Once trapped, it is nearly impossible for insects to crawl out of the steep slippery leaves; they eventually drown.

== Carnivorous behavior ==
&quot;B. reducta&quot; still has many unknowns and is debated among some biologists as to if it truly qualifies to be called a carnivore. However, what is known suggests that it qualifies as a carnivorous bromeliad, along with &quot;Brocchinia hechtioides&quot; and &quot;Catopsis beteroniana&quot;. Its waxy surface, water collection, odor emission, and potential digestive enzymes within the pool of water all point to a passive pitfall trap. In addition, &quot;B. reducta&quot; leaves are covered in trichomes that are able to absorb nutrients. Its trichomes, located on the outer cell wall, can transport molecules as small as 6.6 nm.

== Commercial use ==
&quot;B. reducta&quot; has been sold commercially on several carnivorous plant websites as a carnivorous specimen that people can own at home. However, there is potential for a large difference in a &quot;B. reducta&quot; specimen that is grown in its natural habitat than one sold and grown commercially. Where a natural growth specimen is bright yellow green, a &quot;B. reducta&quot; grown without its normal light exposure can be darker shades of green. Additionally, the leaves will grow less condensed, and the plant will not reach its natural height.

<doc id="243744" wikidata="Q1542570" url="?curid=243744" title="Grand Chess">
<text>Grand Chess is a large-board chess variant invented by Dutch games designer Christian Freeling in 1984. It is played on a 10×10 board, with each side having two additional pawns and two new pieces: the &quot;marshal&quot; and the &quot;cardinal&quot;.

* The marshal (M) combines powers of a rook and a knight.
* The cardinal (C) combines powers of a bishop and a knight.
Grand Chess uses the same pieces as the earlier variant Capablanca chess, but differs in board size, start position, rules governing pawn moves and promotion, and castling.

A series of Grand Chess Cyber World Championship matches was sponsored by the Dutch game site MindSports. Grand Chess tournaments were held annually beginning in 1998 by the (now defunct) correspondence game club NOST. Larry Kaufman has written that Grand Chess &quot;really is an excellent game and deserves a bigger following&quot;.
==Rules==

The pieces are placed on the players&#x27; first and second , respectively, with the rooks alone on the players&#x27; first ranks. The pawns are placed on the players&#x27; third ranks. Since the rooks are not blocked as much by the other pieces as in standard chess, it is easier for them to activate earlier in the game.

A pawn that reaches a player&#x27;s eighth or ninth ranks can elect to either promote or remain a pawn, but it promote upon reaching the tenth rank. Unlike standard chess, a pawn may be promoted only to a captured piece of the same colour. (So, it is impossible for either side to own two queens, or two marshals, or three rooks, etc.) If, and for as long as, no captured piece is available to promote to, a pawn on a player&#x27;s ninth rank must stay on the ninth rank, but it can still give check.

As in standard chess: pawns can move one or two squares on their first move; pawns can capture &quot;en passant&quot;; checkmate is a win; stalemate is a draw. There is no castling in Grand Chess.

==Embassy chess==

Embassy chess is a variant of Grand Chess created in 2005 by Kevin Hill. It borrows the opening setup from Grand Chess and adapts it to the 10×8 board. Except for the setup, the rules are as per Capablanca chess.

There are multiple chess engines that can play Embassy chess, including ChessV, Zillions of Games with a rules file, Sjaak 2, and Fairy-Stockfish.

Embassy chess can be played against other people on BrainKing and EvoChess.

<doc id="243749" wikidata="Q1378555" url="?curid=243749" title="Multiracial people">
<text>The terms multiracial people refer to people who are of multiple
&quot;races&quot;, and the terms multi-ethnic people refer to people who are of more than one ethnicities. A variety of terms have been used both historically and presently for multiracial people in a variety of contexts, including &quot;multiethnic&quot;, &quot;polyethnic&quot;, occasionally &quot;bi-ethnic&quot;, &quot;biracial&quot;, &quot;mixed-race&quot;, &quot;Métis&quot;, &quot;Muwallad&quot;, &quot;Melezi&quot;, &quot;Coloured&quot;, &quot;Dougla&quot;, &quot;half-caste&quot;, &quot;ʻafakasi&quot;, &quot;mulatto&quot;, &quot;mestizo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Melungeon&quot;, &quot;quadroon&quot;, &quot;octoroon&quot;, &quot;griffe&quot;, &quot;sacatra&quot;, &quot;sambo/zambo&quot;, &quot;Eurasian&quot;, &quot;hapa&quot;, &quot;hāfu&quot;, &quot;Garifuna&quot;, &quot;pardo&quot;, and &quot;Gurans&quot;. A number of these once-acceptable terms are now considered offensive, in addition to those that were initially coined for pejorative use.

Individuals of multiracial backgrounds make up a significant portion of the population in many parts of the world. In North America, studies have found that the multiracial population is continuing to grow. In many countries of Latin America, mestizos make up the majority of the population and in some others also mulattoes. In the Caribbean, multiracial people officially make up the majority of the population in the Dominican Republic (73%), Aruba (68%), and Cuba (51%).

== Definitions ==

=== In terms of race ===

While defining race is controversial, &quot;race&quot; remains a commonly used term for classification, often related to visible physical characteristics or known community. Insofar as race is defined differently in different cultures, perceptions of mixed race are subjective.

According to U.S. sociologist Troy Duster and ethicist Pilar Ossorio:
In the United States:
==== Related terms ====
In the English-speaking world, many terms for mixed-race people exist, some of which are pejorative or are no longer used. &quot;Mulato&quot;, &quot;zambo&quot; and &quot;mestizo&quot; are used in Spanish, &quot;mulato&quot;, &quot;caboclo&quot;, &quot;cafuzo&quot;, &quot;ainoko&quot; (from Japanese) and &quot;mestiço&quot; in Portuguese, and &quot;mulâtre&quot; and &quot;métis&quot; in French. These terms are also in certain contexts used in the English-speaking world. In Canada, the Métis are a recognized ethnic group of mixed European and Indigenous American descent, who have status in the law similar to that of First Nations.

Terms such as &quot;mulatto&quot; for people of partially African descent and &quot;mestizo&quot; for people of partially Native American descent are still used by English-speaking people of the Western Hemisphere but mostly to refer to the past or to the demography of Latin America and its diasporic population. &quot;Half-breed&quot; is a historic term for people of partial Native American ancestry; it is now considered pejorative and discouraged from use. &quot;Mestee&quot;, once widely used, is now used mostly for members of historically mixed-race groups, such as Louisiana Creoles, Melungeons, Redbones, Brass Ankles and Mayles.

In South Africa and much of English-speaking southern Africa, the term &quot;Coloured&quot; was used to describe both mixed-race persons of African and European descent, and those Asians not of African descent. 

In Latin America, populations became triracial after the introduction of African slavery. A panoply of terms developed during the Spanish and Portuguese colonial periods, including terms such as &quot;zambo&quot; for persons of Native American and native African descent. Charts and diagrams intended to explain the classifications were common. The well-known &quot;Casta&quot; paintings in Mexico and, to some extent, Peru, were illustrations of the different classifications.

At one time, Latin American census categories have used such classifications. In Brazilian censuses since the Imperial times, for example, most persons of mixed heritage, except Asian Brazilians with some European descent (or any other to the extent it is not clearly perceptible) and vice versa, tend to be thrown into the single category of &quot;pardo&quot;. But racial boundaries in Brazil are related less to ancestry than to phenotype. A westernized Amerindian with copper-colored skin may also be classified as a &quot;pardo&quot;, a &quot;caboclo&quot; in this case, despite not being mixed race. A European-looking person, even with one or more native African or Indigenous ancestors, is not classified as &quot;pardo&quot; but as &quot;branco&quot;, a white Brazilian. The same applies to &quot;negros&quot;, Afro-Brazilians whose European or Native American ancestors are not visible in their appearance. According to genetic research, most Brazilians of all racial groups (except Asian-Brazilians and natives) are, to some extent, mixed-race.

In the English language, the terms &quot;miscegenation&quot; and &quot;amalgamation&quot; were used for unions between whites, blacks, and other ethnic groups. The term &#x27;miscegenation&#x27; initially replaced &#x27;amalgamation&#x27; due to the latter&#x27;s association with slavery in the 1800s, while &#x27;miscegenation&#x27; is today often considered offensive and controversial. The terms &quot;mixed-race&quot;, &quot;biracial&quot; or &quot;multiracial&quot; are becoming generally accepted. In other languages, terms for miscegenation are not necessarily considered offensive.

=== In terms of ethnicity ===
The terms &quot;multi-ethnic people&quot; or &quot;ethnically mixed people&quot; refer to people who are of more than one ethnicity.

== Regions with significant mixed-race populations ==

=== Africa ===
In East Africa, specifically Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (including portions of the East African Community), people of mixed race are called half-castes (in English) or &quot;chotara&quot; (singular, in Swahili), &quot;wachotara&quot; (plural in Swahili).

==== North Africa ====

North Africa has numerous mixed-race communities, reflecting a history of both extensive Mediterranean trade around the region and later colonization and migration by African groups. Among these are the Haratin, oasis-dwellers of Saharan southern Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. They are believed to be an ethnicity composed of Sub-Saharan African and Berber ancestry. They constitute a socially and ethnically distinct group within the Maghreb.

For centuries, Arab slave traders sold sub-Saharan Africans as slaves in cumulatively large numbers throughout the Persian Gulf, Anatolia, Central Asia and the Arab world. Communities descended from these slaves and local peoples can be found throughout these regions. Barbary pirates were known to attack European and British ships and take Europeans into slavery as well. So many were taken, that the memoirs of survivors are considered a literary genre known as captivity narratives. When English and other European colonists were taken captive by Native Americans, they had models for recounting their trials.

Cape Verde, in west Africa, has one of the most mixed-race populations (around 75% of the population) on the planet.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between Native Europeans (people of European descent) and non-Whites (being classified as African, Asian and Coloured). But this followed centuries of interaction and unions resulting in mixed-race children. This law was repealed in 1985.

Mixed-race South Africans are commonly referred to as &quot;Coloureds&quot;. According to the 2016 South African Census, they are the second-largest ethnic group (8.8%), behind Native Africans, or Native African Bantu peoples, who constitute (80.8%) of the current population. European South Africans make up 8.1%.

==== Madagascar ====

Madagascar was settled between the first and ninth centuries AD by two groups: Austronesian peoples who arrived on outrigger canoes from across the Indian Ocean, and Bantu peoples who crossed the Mozambique Channel from mainland Africa. These two groups intermixed, forming the modern Malagasy people; later migrants from Arabia, Somalia, and India added to the genetic mixture.

Virtually all Malagasy people are of some degree of mixed descent; however, the amount of mixture varies greatly between regions of Madagascar, despite all Malagasy people sharing a common language and similar cultural elements. The Malagasy of the central highlands of Madagascar have predominantly Austronesian ancestry, the Malagasy of the west coast and the south of the island have predominantly Bantu ancestry, and Malagasy of the island&#x27;s east coast are of roughly equal degrees Bantu and Austronesian ancestry. The average Malagasy person&#x27;s genetic makeup includes a roughly equal blend of Southeast Asian and East African genes.

=== Asia ===

==== India ====
=====Ancient India=====
The people of the Indian subcontinent have a diverse genetic pool, being composed of South Asian hunter-gatherers, Neolithic Iranians, and Western Steppe Herders. This makes up the genome of modern-day Indians and varies from caste and region. 

=====Modern India=====
Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a radical thinker and educator, was of Indian and European background.
Prior to colonization, the peoples of India had a long history of trade and other interaction with other peoples. More recently a Eurasian mix developed during the Colonial period, beginning with the French, Dutch, Portuguese and other European traders and merchants, including British. Such interaction continued during the British Rule in India, although it lessened as British families settled in the country. The estimated population of Anglo-Indians, the term for these Eurasians, is 600,000 worldwide, with the majority living in India and the UK.

Article 366(2) of the Indian Constitution defines Anglo-Indian as: (2) an Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only;

==== Myanmar (Burma) ====
Myanmar (formerly Burma) was a British colony from 1826 until 1948. Other European nationals were active in the country before the British arrived. Intermarriage and relationships took place among such settlers and merchants with the local Burmese population, and subsequently between British colonists and the Burmese. The local Eurasian population is known as the Anglo-Burmese. This group dominated colonial society and through the early years of independence. After Burma gained independence in 1948, many Anglo-Burmese left the country; the diaspora resides primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. An estimated 52,000 Anglo-Burmese live in Burma.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippines was a Spanish colony for almost four centuries, or 333 years. The United States took it over after the Spanish-American War, ruling for 46 years. Many Filipinos are mixed Spanish Filipino, and according to Fedor Jagor, one-third of Luzon which holds half the Philippine population, has Spanish or Latin-American admxiture. And it also has Philippine-American descent. 

After the defeat of Spain during the Spanish–American War in 1898, the Philippines and other remaining Spanish colonies were ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. The Philippines was under U.S. sovereignty until 1946, though occupied by Japan during World War II. In 1946, in the Treaty of Manila, the U.S. recognized the Republic of the Philippines as an independent nation. Even after 1946, the U.S. maintained a strong military presence in the Philippines, with as many as 21 U.S. military bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there as defense in Asia and during the Vietnam War. 

After the bases closed in 1992, American troops left, often abandoning partners and their Amerasian children. The Pearl S. Buck International foundation estimates there are 52,000 Amerasians in the Philippines, with 5,000 in the Clark area of Angeles City. An academic research paper presented in the U.S. (in 2012) by an Angeles, Pampanga, Philippines Amerasian college research study unit suggests that the number could be a lot more, possibly reaching 250,000. This is also partially due to the fact that almost all Amerasians intermarried with other Amerasians and Filipino natives. The newer Amerasians from the United States would add to the already older settlement of peoples from other countries in the Americas that happened when the Philippines was under Spanish rule, as the Philippines once received immigrants from Spanish occupied Panama, Peru, and Mexico.

In the United States, intermarriage between Filipinos and other ethnicities is common. They have the highest number of interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California. Some 21.8% of Philippine-Americans are of mixed ancestry.

==== Singapore and Malaysia ====
According to government statistics, the population of Singapore as of September 2007 was 4.68 million. Mixed-race people, including Chindians and Eurasians, formed 2.4%.

In Singapore and Malaysia, the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between Chinese and Indians. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as &quot;Chindian&quot;. The Malaysian government classifies them only by their father&#x27;s ethnicity. As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as &quot;Indian&quot; by the government. As for the Malays, who are predominantly Muslim, legal restrictions in Malaysia make it uncommon for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly Hindu, or the Chinese, who are predominantly Buddhist and Taoist. But Indian Muslims and Arabs in Singapore and Malaysia often take local Malay wives, because of their common Islamic faith.

The Chitty people, in Singapore and the Malacca state of Malaysia, are Tamils with considerable Malay ancestry. The early Tamil settlers took local wives, as they had not brought their own women at that time.

In the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, intermarriage has been common between Chinese and native tribespeople, such as the Murut and Dusun in Sabah, and the Iban and Bisaya in Sarawak. A mixture of cultures has resulted in both states. The offspring of these marriages are called &quot;Sino-(name of tribe)&quot;, e.g. Sino-Dusun. Normally, children are strongly affected by the father&#x27;s ethnicity and culture, being raised in his culture. These Sino-natives usually become fluent in both Malay and English. A smaller number are able to speak Chinese dialects and Mandarin, especially those who have received education in vernacular Chinese schools.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Due to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the island of Sri Lanka has been a confluence for settlers from various parts of the world. There are several mixed-race ethnicities in the island. The most notable mixed-race group is the Sri Lankan Moors, who trace their ancestry to Arab traders who settled on the island and intermarried with local women. Today, the Sri Lankan Moors live primarily in urban communities. They preserve Arab-Islamic cultural heritage while adopting many Southern Asian customs.

The Burghers are a Eurasian ethnic group. They are descendants through paternal lines of European colonists from the 16th to 20th centuries (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, German and British) and with maternal ancestry among local women. Other European minorities in such admixtures include Swedish, Norwegian, French and Irish.

The Sri Lanka Kaffirs are an ethnic group partially descended from 16th-century Portuguese traders and their enslaved Africans. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, the Sri Lanka Kaffir language, which is now extinct. Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja, as well as the Portuguese Sinhalese, Creole, Afro-Sinhalese varieties.

==== Vietnam ====

Under terms of the Geneva Accords of 1954, departing French troops took thousands of Vietnamese wives and children with them after the First Indochina War. Some Eurasians stayed in Vietnam, after independence from French rule.
==== Japan ====
==== China ====
==== West Asia ====

Ottoman slave traders sold slaves in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries throughout the Persian Gulf, Anatolia, Central Asia and the Arab world and communities descended from these slaves can be found throughout these regions.

=== Europe ===
Romani people are of mixed South Asian, Middle Eastern and European ancestry. They settled in Europe hundreds of years ago.
==== United Kingdom ====

In 1991 an analysis of the census showed that 50% of Mixed Caribbean men born in the UK have native British partners, and the 2011 BBC documentary &quot;Mixed Britannia&quot; noted that 1 in 10 British children are growing up in mixed households. 
In 2000, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that &quot;Britain has the highest rate of interracial relationships in the world&quot; and certainly the UK has the highest rate in the European Union. The 2001 census showed the population of England to be 1.4% mixed-race, compared with 2.7% in Canada and 1.4% in the U.S. (estimate from 2002), although this U.S. figure did not include mixed-race people who had a parent with African Ancestry. Both the US and UK have fewer people identifying as mixed race, however, than Canada.

In the United Kingdom, many mixed-race people have Caribbean, African or Asian heritage. For example, supermodel Naomi Campbell has Jamaican, African and Asian roots. Some, like seven time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, are referred to or describe themselves as &#x27;mixed&#x27;.

The 2001 UK Census included a section entitled &#x27;Mixed&#x27;, to which 1.4% (1.6% by 2005 estimates) of people responded, which was split further into &quot;White and Black Caribbean&quot;, &quot;White and Asian&quot;, &quot;White and Native African&quot; and &quot;Other Mixed&quot;. In the 2011 census, 2.2% chose &#x27;Mixed&#x27; for the question on ethnicity.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====

Mixed-race Canadians in 2006 officially totaled 1.5% of the population, up from 1.2% in 2001. The official mixed-race population grew by 25% since the previous census. Of these, the most frequent combinations were &quot;multiple visible minorities&quot; (for example, people of mixed black and South Asian heritage form the majority, specifically in Toronto), followed closely by &quot;white-black&quot;, &quot;white-Chinese&quot;, &quot;white-Arab&quot; and many other smaller mixes.

During the time of slavery in the United States, a very large but unknown number of African American slaves escaped to Canada, where slavery was made illegal in 1834, via the Underground Railroad. Many of these people married in with European Canadian and Native Canadian populations, although their precise numbers and the numbers of their descendants are not known.

Another 1.2% of Canadians officially are Métis (descendants of a historical population who were partially Aboriginal—also called &quot;Indian&quot; or &quot;Native&quot;—and European, particularly English, Scottish, Irish and French ethnic groups). Although the term &quot;Métis&quot; stems from the Latin verb , &quot;to mix&quot;, the Métis people are a distinct ethnic group within Canada.

==== United States ====

In the United States, the 2000 census was the first in the history of the country to offer respondents the option of identifying themselves as belonging to more than one race. This mixed-race option was considered a necessary adaptation to the demographic and cultural changes that the United States has been experiencing.

Mixed-race Americans officially numbered 6.1 million in 2006, or 2.0% of the population. There is considerable evidence that an accurate number would be much higher. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their mixed-race heritage. The development of binary thinking about race meant that African Americans, a high proportion of whom have also had European ancestry, were classified as black. Some are now reclaiming additional ancestries. Many Americans today are multi-racial without knowing it. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2002, 75% of all African Americans had mixed ancestries, usually European and Native American.

In 2010, the number of Americans who checked both &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; on their census forms was 134 percent higher than it had been a decade earlier. In 2012, those choosing &#x27;Two or more races&#x27; on the census was 2.4% of the total.

According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the mixed-race population that is part white is as follows:
*White/Native American and Alaskan Native: 7,015,017
*White/African American: 737,492
*White/Asian: 727,197 and
*White/Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander: 125,628.

The stigma of a mixed-race heritage, associated with racial discrimination among numerous racial groups, has decreased significantly in the United States. People of mixed-race heritage can identify themselves now in the U.S. Census by any combination of races, whereas before Americans were required to select from only one category. For example, in 2010, they were offered choices of one or more racial categories from the following list:
*White
*Black, African Am. or Negro
*American Indian or Alaska Native
*Asian Indian

*Chinese
*Filipino
*Japanese
*Korean
*Vietnamese

*Native Hawaiian
*Guamanian or Chamorro
*Samoan

*Other Asian [specify]
*Other Pacific Islander [specify]
*Some Other Race [specify]


The US has a growing mixed-race identity movement, reflective of a desire by people to claim their full identities. Interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks, was historically deemed immoral and illegal in most states in the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century because of its long association of blacks with the slave caste. California and the Western United States had similar laws to prohibit European-Asian marriages, which was associated with discrimination against Chinese and Japanese on the West Coast. Many states eventually repealed such laws and a 1967 decision by the US Supreme Court (&quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;) overturned all remaining US anti-miscegenation laws.

The United States is one of the most racially diverse countries in the world. Americans are mostly mixed ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities culturally distinct in their former countries. Assimilation and integration took place, unevenly at different periods of history, depending on the American region. The &quot;Americanization&quot; of foreign ethnic groups and the inter-racial diversity of millions of Americans has been a fundamental part of its history, especially on frontiers where different groups of people came together.

On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was sworn in as America&#x27;s first mixed-race president, as he is the son of a European American mother of mostly English descent and a Luo father from Kenya. He acknowledges both parents. His official White House biography describes him as African American. In Hawai&#x27;i, the U.S. state in which he was born, he would be called &quot;hapa&quot;, which is the Hawaiian word for &quot;mixed race&quot;.

=== Oceania ===
==== Fiji ====
Fiji has long been a multi-ethnic country, with a vast majority of people being mixed race even if they do not self-identify in that manner. The indigenous Fijians are of mixed Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry, resulting from years of migration of islanders from various places mixing with each other. Fiji Islanders from the Lau group have intermarried with Tongans and other Polynesians over the years. The overwhelming majority of the rest of the indigenous Fijians, though, can be genetically traced to having mixed Polynesian/Melanesian ancestry.

The Indo-Fijian population is also a hodge-podge of South Asian immigrants (called Girmits in Fiji), who came as indentured labourers beginning in 1879. While a few of these labourers managed to bring wives, many of them either took or were given wives once they arrived in Fiji. The Girmits, who are classified as simply &quot;Indians&quot; to this day, came from many parts of the Indian subcontinent of present-day India, Pakistan and to a lesser degree Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is easy to recognize the Indian mixtures present in Fiji and see obvious traces of Southern and Northern Indians and other groups who have been categorised together. More of this phenomenon would have likely happened if the religious groups represented (primarily Hindu, Muslim and Sikh) had not resisted to some degree marriage between religious groups, which tended to be from more similar parts of the Indian subcontinent.

Over the years, particularly in the sugar cane-growing regions of Western Viti Levu and parts of Vanua Levu, Indo-Fijians and Indigenous Fijians have mixed. Others have Chinese/Fijian ancestry, Indo-Fijian/Samoan or Rotuman ancestry and European/Fijian ancestry (often called &quot;part Fijians&quot;). The latter are often descendants of shipwrecked sailors and settlers who came during the colonial period. Migration from a dozen or more different Pacific countries (Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and Wallis and Futuna being the most prevalent) have added to the various ethnicities and intermarriages.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===


&quot;Mestizo&quot; is the common word for mixed-race people in Latin America, especially people with Native American and Spanish or other European ancestry. Mestizos make up a large portion of Latin Americans, comprising a majority in many countries.

In Latin America, racial mixture was officially acknowledged from colonial times. There was official nomenclature for every conceivable mixture present in the various countries. Initially, this classification was used as a type of caste system, where rights and privileges were accorded depending on one&#x27;s official racial classification. Official caste distinctions were abolished in many countries of the Spanish-speaking Americas as they became independent of Spain. Several terms have remained in common usage.

Race and racial mixture have played a significant role in the politics of many Latin American countries. In most countries, for example Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Panama, a majority of the population can be described as biracial or mixed race (depending on the country). In Mexico, over 80% of the population is mestizo in some degree or another.

The Mexican philosopher and educator José Vasconcelos authored an essay on the subject, &quot;La Raza Cósmica&quot;, celebrating racial mixture. Venezuelan ex-president Hugo Chávez, of Spanish, indigenous and African ancestry, made positive references to the mixed-race ancestry of most Latin Americans from time to time.

Colonialism throughout the West Indies has created diverse populations on many islands, including people of mixed race identities. Of note is the mixture of West African communities, most brought to the region as slaves and East Indian settlers, most of whom came as indentured labor after the abolition of slavery. Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname claim the highest populations of such mixtures, known locally as &quot;douglas&quot;. In addition to such mixtures, many inhabitants of the West Indies can also have any combination of Amerindian, Latino, European, Chinese, Arab and Jewish heritage.

==== Brazil ====

According to the 2022 official census, 45.34% of Brazilians identified themselves as Pardo. This option is normally chosen by people who consider themselves mixed race. The Mixed Race Day (), on 27 June, is official event in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Paraíba and a holiday in two cities. Other than pardo, people who are mixed race also have other names to refer to themselves such as , caboclo, &quot;mestiço&quot; and mulatto. Those terms are not considered offensive and focus more on skin color than ethnicity (they are seen as comparable to other human characteristics, such as being short or tall).

Most Brazilians of mixed race are usually tri-racial, with Amerindian, European, and African origins. Other common mixed-race groups are between European and African (&quot;mulatto&quot;) and Amerindian and European (&quot;caboclo&quot; or &quot;mameluco&quot;). But there are also African and Amerindian (&quot;cafuzo&quot;) and East Asian (mostly Japanese) and European/other (&quot;ainoko&quot; or more recently, &quot;hāfu&quot;). These groups are found throughout the country to varying degrees.

Since mixed-race relations in Brazilian society have occurred for many generations, some people find it difficult to trace their own ethnic ancestry. Today a majority of mixed-race Brazilians do not really know their ethnic ancestry, but they are aware that their ancestors were probably Portuguese, African and Amerindian. Additionally, a very large number of Italians (Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy), Japanese (the largest Japanese population outside Japan), Lebanese (the largest Lebanese population outside Lebanon), Germans, Poles, Russians and others contributed to Brazil&#x27;s racial makeup. A high percentage of Brazilians is also of Jewish descent, perhaps hundreds of thousands, mostly found in the northeast of the country who cannot be sure of their ancestry as they descend from the so-called &quot;Crypto-Jews&quot; (Jews who practiced Judaism in secret but outwardly pretended to be Catholics), also called Marranos or New Christians, often considered Portuguese. According to some sources, one third of families arrived from Portugal during colonization were of Jewish origin.

Neil Bush was born on January 22, 1955, in Midland, Texas. Bush was named after a good friend of the family, Henry Neil Mallon, chairman of Dresser Industries, George H. W. Bush&#x27;s employer. As a child, Bush spent some summers and holidays at his family&#x27;s estate in Maine, the Bush compound.

At age 11, he enrolled in the exclusive St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. He struggled through school; a counselor told his mother that he was doubtful the boy had the potential to graduate. He was later diagnosed as having dyslexia, and his mother spent much time assisting him with his learning disability. Eventually, his grades improved and he graduated from St. Albans in 1973.

In 1977, Bush earned a degree in economics from Tulane University. In 1979, Bush earned an MBA.
==Career and business dealings==
===Silverado Savings and Loan===
Bush settled in the Denver area and became a member of the board of directors of Denver-based Silverado Savings and Loan from 1985 to 1988 during the S&amp;L crisis of the 1980s. Since his father George H. W. Bush was Vice President of the United States, his role in Silverado&#x27;s failure was a focal point of publicity.

The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision investigated Silverado&#x27;s failure and determined that Bush had engaged in numerous &quot;breaches of his fiduciary duties involving multiple conflicts of interest.&quot; Although Bush was not indicted on criminal charges, a civil action was brought against him and the other Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it was eventually settled out of court, with Bush paying $50,000 as part of the settlement.

A friend who also donated funds to the Republican Party set up a fund to help defer costs Neil incurred in his S&amp;L
legal defense.

===Ignite! Learning===

In 1999, Bush co-founded Ignite! Learning, an educational software corporation. Bush has said he started Austin-based Ignite! Learning because of his learning difficulties in middle school and those of his son, Pierce. The software uses multiple intelligence methods to provide varying types of content to appeal to multiple learning styles.

To fund Ignite!, Bush raised $23 million from US investors, including his parents, as well as businessmen from Taiwan, Japan, Kuwait, the British Virgin Islands and the United Arab Emirates, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Documented investors included Kuwaiti company head Mohammed Al Saddah, and Chinese computer executive Winston Wong, as well as the late Russian billionaire expatriate Boris Berezovsky, and Berezovsky&#x27;s partner Badri Patarkatsishvili.

Bush&#x27;s relationship with the late controversial oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a political enemy of Russian President Vladimir Putin who at the time of his death had been under indictment for fraud in Russia and an applicant for asylum in the United Kingdom, has been noted in the media. Berezovsky, who died in 2013, had been an investor in Bush&#x27;s Ignite! program since at least 2003. Bush met with Berezovsky in Latvia. The meeting caused tension between that country and Russia due to Berezovsky&#x27;s fugitive status. Bush was also seen in Berezovsky&#x27;s box at Arsenal&#x27;s Emirates Stadium for a football game in 2006. There had also been speculation in the English language &quot;Moscow Times&quot; that the relationship may cause tension in U.S.-Russian bilateral relations, &quot;especially since Putin had taken pains to build a personal relationship with the U.S. president,&quot; George Bush.

In 2002, Neil Bush commended his brother, George, for his efforts on education as president, but he questioned the emphasis on constant testing to keep federal aid coming to public schools: &quot;I share the concerns of many that if our system is driven around assessments, pencil-and-paper tests that test a kid&#x27;s ability to memorize stuff, I would say that reliance threatens to institutionalize bad teaching practices.&quot;

As of October 2006, over 13 US school districts (out of over 14,000 school districts nationwide) have used federal funds made available through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to buy Ignite&#x27;s portable learning centers at $3,800 apiece.

A December 2003 Style section article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Bush&#x27;s salary from Ignite! was $180,000 per year.

===Kopin stock trades===
In July 1999, Bush made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of a company where he had been employed as a consultant. The company, Kopin Corporation of Taunton, Massachusetts, announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, &quot;any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information.&quot;

When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.

===Speaking engagements===
Bush has often been invited to speak to audiences overseas. Bush says he has courtesy visits with world leaders but has no plans to wade into foreign policy. &quot;Oftentimes because of my father&#x27;s goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it&#x27;s enjoyable for me,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Some of these folks are family friends.&quot;

Speaking at a Saudi Arabian economic forum in January 2002, Bush referred to growing anti-American sentiment in Arab countries and said the two peoples must communicate better. He said the Arab P.R. machine is not as good as Israel&#x27;s.

Bush frequently travels to the Middle East, Europe and Asia to negotiate deals and raise capital for various businesses. According to court filings from his divorce, in 2000 he was paid $1.3 million for such work. This includes $642,500 as a commission for introducing an Asian investor to the owners of an American high-tech company. The George W. Bush-era White House Administration appeared unfazed by his world travel. &quot;The president knows his brother will always do the right thing,&quot; press secretary Ari Fleischer said.&quot;

===Other business engagements===
In 2002, Bush signed a consulting contract that paid $2 million in stock over five years to work for Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a firm backed by Jiang Mianheng, the son of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, plus $10,000 for every board meeting he attends.

Bush serves as co-chairman of a company called Crest Investment. Crest pays him $60,000 a year to provide miscellaneous consulting services.

In 2001, Neil Bush incorporated an investment firm called LehmanBush with veteran China lawyer Edward Lehman.

==Philanthropy and charity involvement, volunteer work==
===George H.W. Bush Foundation For U.S.-China Relations===
Neil Bush is the founder and chairman of the George H.W. Bush Foundation For U.S.-China Relations. Created in 2017, the Foundation serves as a U.S.-China Relations Think Tank, Track 2 Diplomacy Policy Hub and for Business, Trade and U.S. Investment. The organization holds an annual George H.W. Bush Conference on U.S.-China Relations. The purpose of The George H. W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations seeks to advance U.S.-China relations in ways that reflect the ethos and values of President George H. W. Bush, whose visionary, wise, deft and steady stewardship of the U.S.-China relationship during his tenure as president was exemplary of the highest attributes and values of true statesmanship. Through an active, wide-ranging and highly innovative program of activities, the Bush China Foundation promotes the late president&#x27;s life-long view that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world and that a positive and constructive relationship between the two countries is in the best interest of both the United States and China as well as the entire global community.

===Points of Light===
Neil Bush is the chairman of Points of Light, an international nonprofit that works to increase volunteerism in the world. Points of Light has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million.

===Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue===
Bush was a founding director, along with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI), of the Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue (FIIRD). The foundation promotes ecumenical understanding and publishes religious texts and was founded in 1999. Bush is no longer on the board of the foundation.

===Anti-Ritalin campaign===
In 2002, Neil Bush told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he &quot;endured his own Ritalin hell seven years ago when educators in a Houston private school diagnosed his son, Pierce, (then) 16, with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and pushed medication.&quot;

In a September 26, 2002, episode of &quot;CNN Interview&quot;, Bush told Connie Chung:

Bush decided &quot;the educators were wrong&quot; about his son. &quot;There is a systemic problem in this country, where schools are often forcing parents to turn to Ritalin,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s obvious to me that we have a crisis.&quot;

Also that year, Bush testified before a hearing of the United States Congress to speak out against overmedicating children for learning disorders.

He has suggested that many parents believe the ADD and ADHD diagnoses and subsequent medicating of their children because it explains why they aren&#x27;t doing well in school, saying &quot;it&#x27;s the system that is failing to engage children in the classroom. My heart goes out to any parents who are being led to believe their kids have a disorder or are disabled.&quot;

Neil Bush (along with filmmaker Michael Moore) is credited in the cast of a 2005 documentary film, &quot;The Drugging of Our Children&quot; directed by Gary Null. In the film&#x27;s trailer Bush says: &quot;Just because it is easy to drug a kid and get them to be compliant doesn&#x27;t make it right to do it.&quot;

===Ted Cruz presidential campaign===
After his brother Jeb dropped out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race, Neil and his wife Maria signed on to the finance team of fellow Republican Ted Cruz.

==Personal life==
Bush was married to Sharon (née Smith) Bush (born May 19, 1952) for 23 years. The couple have three children: Lauren Bush Lauren (born June 25, 1984), Pierce Mallon Bush (born March 11, 1986) and Ashley Walker Bush (born February 7, 1989). The couple divorced in April 2003. Bush&#x27;s divorce deposition gained public attention when he admitted to several sexual encounters in Thailand and Hong Kong. Sharon gained custody of their minor child Ashley, who for a while was estranged from her father. In addition, Sharon kept their marital home after she collected enough money to pay off the mortgage.

In 2004, Bush remarried in Houston, Texas, to Mexican-born Maria (née Manass) Andrews, a volunteer at the Houston literacy-foundation office of Bush&#x27;s mother, Barbara. Robert Andrews, Andrews&#x27; ex-husband, sued Sharon Bush in September 2003 for defamation after she alleged that Neil Bush was the father of Andrews&#x27; two-year-old son. DNA testing showed that Andrews was the father, but the suit was dismissed in 2005.

Bush&#x27;s son Pierce was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020 from Texas&#x27; 22nd district, but finished third in a fifteen-way primary.

<doc id="243763" wikidata="Q3792005" url="?curid=243763" title="Basic copper carbonate">
<text>Basic copper carbonate is a chemical compound, more properly called copper(II) carbonate hydroxide. It can be classified as a coordination polymer or a salt. It consists of copper(II) bonded to carbonate and hydroxide with formula . It is a green solid that occurs in nature as the mineral malachite. It has been used since antiquity as a pigment, and it is still used as such in artist paints, sometimes called verditer, green bice, or mountain green.

Sometimes basic copper carbonate refers to ()2()2, a blue crystalline solid also known as the mineral azurite. It too has been used as pigment, sometimes under the name mountain blue or blue verditer.

Both malachite and azurite can be found in the verdigris patina that is found on weathered brass, bronze, and copper. The composition of the patina can vary, in a maritime environment depending on the environment a basic chloride may be present, in an urban environment basic sulfates may be present.

This compound is often improperly called (even in chemistry articles) copper carbonate, cupric carbonate, and similar names. The true (neutral) copper(II) carbonate CuCO3 is not known to occur naturally. It is decomposed by water or moisture from the air. It was synthesized only in 1973 by high temperature and very high pressures.

==Preparation==
Basic copper carbonate is prepared by combining aqueous solutions of copper(II) sulfate and sodium carbonate. Basic copper carbonate precipitates from the solution, with release of carbon dioxide :

Basic copper carbonate can also be prepared by treating aqueous solutions of copper(II) sulfate with sodium bicarbonate.

Copper(II) sulfate may also be substituted with Copper(II) chloride.

== Reactions ==
Basic copper carbonate is decomposed by acids, such as solutions of hydrochloric acid , into the copper(II) salt and carbon dioxide.

In 1794 the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust (1754–1826) thermally decomposed copper carbonate to CO2 and CuO, cupric oxide.

The basic copper carbonates, malachite and azurite, both decompose forming H2O, CO2, and CuO, cupric oxide.

==Uses==
Basic copper carbonate is used to remove thiols and hydrogen sulfide from some gas streams, a process called &quot;sweetening&quot;. Like many other copper compounds, it also has been used as an algaecide, wood preservative and similar applications. It is a precursor to various catalysts and copper soaps.

Both malachite and azurite, as well as synthetic basic copper carbonate have been used as pigments. One example of the use of both azurite and its artificial form blue verditer is the portrait of the family of Balthasar Gerbier by Peter Paul Rubens. The green skirt of Deborah Kip is painted in azurite, smalt, blue verditer (artificial form of azurite), yellow ochre, lead-tin-yellow and yellow lake. The green color is achieved by mixing blue and yellow pigments.

<text>John Henry is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock group They Might Be Giants. It was released in 1994. It is the first album by They Might Be Giants to include a full band arrangement, rather than synthesized and programmed backing tracks. The album&#x27;s name, a reference to the man versus machine fable of John Henry, is an allusion to the band&#x27;s fundamental switch to more conventional instrumentation, especially the newly established use of a human drummer instead of a drum machine.

&quot;John Henry&quot; is TMBG&#x27;s longest record and was the band&#x27;s highest-charting adult album, having peaked at #61 on the Billboard 200, until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Join Us&quot;, which peaked at #32. In 2013, the album was reissued across a double LP by Asbestos Records.

==Lyrical themes==
The lyrics to the song &quot;AKA Driver&quot; refer to a &quot;NyQuil driver&quot;. John Flansburgh offered an explanation of the legal issue with the inclusion of a brand name: 
&quot;I Should Be Allowed to Think&quot; excerpts the first line (&quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical&quot;) of the poem &quot;Howl&quot; by Allen Ginsberg. The song is also, according to its author, John Linnell, an example of the use of an &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;. &quot;Meet James Ensor&quot; refers to an eccentric Belgian expressionist painter whose works excited John Flansburgh. In an interview, Flansburgh explained that &quot;the line &#x27;Dig him up and shake his hand&#x27; is actually very specific – a parallel idea to a lot of his paintings which involve resurrections, skeletons and puppets being animated. [...] With the song, I&#x27;m trying to encapsulate the issues of his life – an eccentric guy who became celebrated and was soon left behind as his ideas were taken into the culture and other people became expressionists.&quot; &quot;Why Must I Be Sad?&quot; is a string of references to Alice Cooper song titles and lyrics, involving several titles from the &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; album including &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy,&quot; &quot;I Love the Dead,&quot; and others.

==Appearances in other media==
Instrumental excerpts from &quot;No One Knows My Plan&quot; and &quot;The End of The Tour&quot; were used as the opening and closing themes, respectively, during the first season of the animated variety show Cartoon Planet in 1995. &quot;No One Knows My Plan&quot; was also used in a 30-second PBS Kids web promo in 2005.

==Track listing==

<doc id="243781" wikidata="Q1641150" url="?curid=243781" title="Tibetic languages">
<text>The Tibetic languages form a well-defined group of languages descending from Old Tibetan. According to Nicolas Tournadre, there are 50 Tibetic languages, which branch into more than 200 dialects, which could be grouped into eight dialect continua. These Tibetic languages are spoken in Tibet, Gilgit-Baltistan, Ladakh, Aksai Chin, Nepal, and in India at Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Classical Tibetan is the major literary language, particularly for its use in Tibetan Buddhist scriptures and literature.

Tibetan languages are spoken by some 6 million people, not all of whom are Tibetan. With the worldwide spread of Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan language has also spread into the western world and can be found in many Buddhist publications and prayer materials, while western students also learn the language for the translation of Tibetan texts. Outside of Lhasa itself, Lhasa Tibetan is spoken by approximately 200,000 exiled Tibetans who have moved from Tibet to India, Nepal and other countries. Tibetan is also spoken by groups of ethnic minorities in Tibet who have lived in close proximity to Tibetans for centuries, but nevertheless retain their own languages and cultures.

Although the Qiang peoples of Kham are classified by China as ethnic Tibetan, the Qiangic languages are not Tibetan, but rather form their own branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family.

Classical Tibetan was not a tonal language, but many varieties such as Central and Khams Tibetan have developed tone registers. Amdo and Ladakhi-Balti are without tone. Tibetan morphology can generally be described as agglutinative.

==Terminology==
Although the term &quot;Tibetic&quot; had been applied in various ways within the Sino-Tibetan research tradition, Nicolas Tournadre defined it as a phylum derived from Old Tibetan. Following Nishi (1987) and Beyer (1992), he identified several lexical innovations that can be used as a diagnosis to distinguish Tibetic from the other languages of the family, such as &quot;seven&quot;.

The &quot;Tibetic languages&quot; in this sense are a substitute for the term &quot;Tibetan languages/dialects&quot; used in the previous literature; the distinction between &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; is not straightforward, and labeling varieties of Tibetic as &quot;Tibetan dialects&quot; could be misleading not only because those &quot;dialects&quot; are often mutually-unintelligible, but also the speakers of Tibetic do not necessarily consider themselves as ethnic Tibetan, as is the case with Sherpas, Ladakhis, Baltis, Lahaulas, Sikkimese and Bhutanese.

==Origins==
Marius Zemp (2018) hypothesizes that Tibetan originated as a pidgin with the West Himalayish language Zhangzhung as its superstratum, and Rgyalrongic as its substratum (both languages are part of the broader Sino-Tibetan family). However, there are many grammatical differences between the Rgyalrongic and Tibetic languages; Rgyalrongic tend to use prefixes such as *kə-, *tə-, etc., while Tibetic languages use suffixes such as -pa/-ba, -ma, -po/-bo, -mo, etc.

Similarly, Tamangic also has a West Himalayish superstratum, but its substratum is derived from a different Sino-Tibetan branch.

Only a few language clusters in the world are derived from a common language which is identical to or closely related to an old literary language. This small group includes the Tibetic languages, as descendants from Old Tibetan (7th–9th centuries), but also the Romance languages with Latin, the Arabic languages (or &quot;dialects&quot;) with Classical Arabic, the Sinitic languages with Middle Chinese, the modern Indic languages with Vedic Sanskrit.

==Classification==

The more divergent languages are spoken in the north and east, likely due to language contact with the Qiangic, Rgyalrongic languages. The divergence exhibited in Khalong may also be due to language shift. In addition, there is Baima, which retains an apparent Qiangic substratum, and has multiple layers of borrowing from Amdo, Khams, and Zhongu, but does not correspond to any established branch of Tibetic.

The two major Tibetic languages used for broadcasting within China are Standard Tibetan and Amdo Tibetan.

===Tournadre &amp; Suzuki (2023)===
Tournadre &amp; Suzuki (2023) recognize 8 geographical &quot;sections&quot;, each with about 7-14 &quot;groups&quot; of Tibetic dialects. This classification is a revision of Tournadre (2014).

===Tournadre (2014)===
Tournadre (2014) classifies the Tibetic languages as eight geolinguistic continua, consisting of 50 languages and over 200 dialects. This is an updated version of his work in 2008. The Eastern and Southeastern branches have lower internal mutual intelligibility, but it is more limited in the Northwestern branch and between certain southern and northern Khams dialects. These continua are spread across five countries with one exception, this being Sangdam, a Khams dialect in Kachin, Myanmar.
*Tibetic
**North-Western: Ladakhi, Zangskari, Balti, Purki
**Western: Spiti, Garzha, Khunu, Jad
**Central: Dbus, Tsang, Phenpo, Lhokha, Tö, Kongpo (in （Kongpo） with Basum)
**South-Western: Sherpa and Jirel; other languages/dialects along the Sino-Nepalese border: Humla, Mugu, Dolpo, Lo-ke, Nubri, Tsum, Langtang, Kyirong, Yolmo, Gyalsumdo, Kagate, Lhomi, Walungge, Tokpe Gola.
**Southern: Dzongkha, Drengjong, Tsamang, Dhromo Lakha, Dur Brokkat, Mera Sakteng Brokpa-ke
**South-Eastern: Hor Nagchu, Hor Bachen, Yushu, Pembar, Rongdrak, Minyak, Dzayul, Derong-Jol, Chaktreng, Muli-Dappa, Semkyi Nyida
***&#x27;Northern route&#x27; dialects: &#x27;Chamdo (Chab-mdo), Derge (sde-dge), and Kandze (dkar-mdzes)
***&#x27;Southern route&#x27; dialects: Markham (smar-khams), Bathang (&#x27;ba&#x27;-thang), Lithang (li-thang)
**Eastern: Drugchu, Khöpokhok, Thewo-Chone, Baima, Sharkhok, Palkyi (or Pashi; four dialects, including Chos-rje), and Zhongu
**North-Eastern
***Amdo
***Gser-Rdo: Gserpa, Khalong
===Tournadre (2005, 2008)===
Tournadre (2005) classifies the Tibetic languages as follows.
*Tibetic
**Central Tibetan
***The basis of Standard Tibetan that includes various Nepalese varieties
**Khams 
**Amdo 
**Dzongkha–Lhokä
***Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Lakha, Naapa, Chocangaca, Brokkat, Brokpa and probably Groma
**Ladakhi–Balti
***Ladakhi, Burig, Zangskari, Balti
**Lahuli–Spiti
**Kyirong–Kagate 
**Sherpa–Jirel
***Sherpa, Jirel
The other languages (Thewo-Chone, Zhongu, Khalong, Dongwang, Gserpa, Zitsadegu, Drugchu, Baima) are not mutually intelligible, but are not known well enough to classify. mDungnag, a Tibetan language spoken in Gansu, is also divergent and is not mutually intelligible with either Khams or Amdo.

Tournadre (2013) adds Tseku and Khamba to Khams, and groups Thewo-Chone, Zhongu, and Baima as an Eastern branch of Tibetic.

===Bradley (1997)===
According to Bradley, the languages cluster as follows (dialect information from the &quot;Tibetan Dialects Project&quot; at the University of Bern):
*Tibetic
**Western Archaic Tibetan (non-tonal), including Ladakhi, Balti and Burig
**Amdo Tibetan (including Thewo-Chone) (non-tonal)
**Khams Tibetan (tonal)
**Western Innovative Tibetan (Lahuli–Spiti) (slightly tonal)
***Dialects of Upper Ladakh and Zanskar, of the Northwest Indian Border Area (Lahaul and Spiti district and Uttarakhand), and of Zanda County (westernmost Tibet)
**Central Tibetan (slightly tonal)
***Most dialects of Ngari Prefecture in western Tibet, of the northern Nepalese border area in Nepal, Tsang dialects of Shigatse Prefecture, and Ü dialects (Lhokha, Lhasa, etc.). The basis of Standard Tibetan. 
**Northern Tibetan (slightly tonal)
***Dialects of Gêrzê, of Nagqu Prefecture in north-central Tibet, and of Nangqên County in South Qinghai(Considered dialects of Khams by Tournadre)
**Southern Tibetan (slightly tonal)
***Groma language of Chumbi Valley in southern Tsang, Sikkimese in India, Sherpa and Jirel in Nepal, and various languages of Bhutan:Dzongkha, Brokkat, Brokpa, Chocangaca, Lakha, Laya dialect, Lunana dialect.
;Other
Some classifications group Khams and Amdo together as Eastern Tibetan (not to be confused with East Bodish, whose speakers are not ethnically Tibetan). Some, like Tournadre, break up Central Tibetan. Phrases such as &#x27;Central Tibetan&#x27; and &#x27;Central Bodish&#x27; may or may not be synonymous: Southern (Central) Tibetan can be found as Southern Bodish, for example; &#x27;Central Tibetan&#x27; may mean dBus or all tonal lects apart from Khams; &#x27;Western Bodish&#x27; may be used for the non-tonal western lects while &#x27;Western Tibetan&#x27; is used for the tonal lects, or &#x27;Bodish&#x27; may even be used for other branches of the Tibeto-Kanauri languages.

=== Lexical similarity ===
Amdo Tibetan has 70% lexical similarity with Central Tibetan and Khams Tibetan, while Khams Tibetan has 80% lexical similarity with Central Tibetan.

== Geographical distribution ==
The Tibetic-speaking area spans six countries: China (PRC), Nepal, Pakistan, India, Bhutan, and Myanmar. Tibetan is also spoken in diaspora communities in Europe, North America (e.g. Little Tibet, Toronto), Asia and Australia.

=== China ===
Within China, the great majority of Tibetic speakers are officially classified into the &quot;Tibetan nationality&quot; which however includes speakers of other Trans-Himalayan languages such as Rgyalrongnic. Aside from Tibet Autonomous Region, there are several autonomous prefectures for the &quot;nationality&quot; in Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan.

=== Nepal ===
Lhasa Tibetan, or more technically, Standard Tibetan (natively called ) is used among post-1950s Tibetan emigrants to Nepal. Other Tibetic varieties such as Sherpa, Jirel and Yolmo are spoken in districts along the China-Nepal border.

=== Bhutan ===
The national language of Bhutan is Dzongkha, a Tibetic language originally spoken in the western region. Although non-Tibetic languages (Tshangla, East Bodish) are dominant in many parts of the country, Dzongkha is also widely used there as a second-language. Other Tibetic varieties of Bhutan include Choča-ngača, Brokpa and Lakha.

=== Pakistan ===
Within areas administrated by Pakistan, Balti is spoken in Gilgit-Baltistan.

=== India ===
Within areas administrated by India, some Tibetic varieties are spoken in Ladakh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh (Kinnaur, Lahul and Spiti), West Bengal (Darjeeling and Kalimpong), as well as Uttarakhand. As with Bhutan and Nepal, there reside a number of Tibetan refugees across the country, notably in Dharamshala where the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration is located.

=== Myanmar ===
In Myanmar, a variant of Khams Tibetan is spoken near the Hkakabo Razi, Kachin State which is adjacent to Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan and Tibet Autonomous Region. Suzuki (2012) describes the phonology of the Sangdam dialect, as well as giving a brief overview of Tibetic varieties in the country.

He estimates there are about 300 Khams Tibetan speakers inhabiting at least four villages in Dazundam Village Tract, Pannandin Sub-township, Nogmong Township, Putao District, Kachin State. The four villages he mentions are Tahaundam, &quot;Shidudan&quot; , Sandam, Madin, the second of which he provides no romanization because the placename is uncharted on the map available to him. According to Suzuki&#x27;s consultant, they migrated from Zayu County, Tibet more than a century ago although they still have contact with relatives living there, and there are few differences between the dialects of the four villages .

Since Rawang people are the ethnic majority of the area, the Tibetans also have a command of Rawang, which is mainly used for interethnic communication; those with primary education can speak and write Burmese as well, while they are illiterate in their own language.

== Writing systems ==

Most Tibetic languages are written in one of two Indic scripts. Standard Tibetan and most other Tibetic languages are written in the Tibetan script with a historically conservative orthography (see below) that helps unify the Tibetan-language area. Some other Tibetan languages (in India and Nepal) are written in the related Devanagari script, which is also used to write Hindi, Nepali and many other languages. However, some Ladakhi and Balti speakers write with the Urdu script; this occurs almost exclusively in Pakistan. The Tibetan script fell out of use in Pakistani Baltistan hundreds of years ago upon the region&#x27;s adoption of Islam. However, increased concern among Balti people for the preservation of their language and traditions, especially in the face of strong Punjabi cultural influence throughout Pakistan, has fostered renewed interest in reviving the Tibetan script and using it alongside the Perso-Arabic script. Many shops in Baltistan&#x27;s capital Skardu in Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;Northern Areas&quot; region have begun supplementing signs written in the Perso-Arabic script with signs written in the Tibetan script. Baltis see this initiative not as separatist but rather as part of an attempt to preserve the cultural aspects of their region which has shared a close history with neighbours like Kashmiris and Punjabis since the arrival of Islam in the region many centuries ago.

== Historical phonology ==
Old Tibetan phonology is rather accurately rendered by the script. The finals were pronounced devoiced although they are written as voiced, the prefix letters assimilated their voicing to the root letters. The graphic combinations &quot;hr&quot; and &quot;lh&quot; represent voiceless and not necessarily aspirate correspondences to &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; respectively. The letter &#x27; was pronounced as a voiced guttural fricative before vowels but as homorganic prenasalization before consonants. Whether the gigu &quot;verso&quot; had phonetic meaning or not remains controversial.

For instance, &quot;Srongbtsan Sgampo&quot; would have been pronounced (now pronounced in Lhasa Tibetan) and &quot;&#x27;babs&quot; would have been pronounced (pronounced in Lhasa Tibetan).

Already in the 9th century the process of cluster simplification, devoicing and tonogenesis had begun in the central dialects, as can be shown by Tibetan words transliterated into other languages, particularly Middle Chinese but also Uyghur.

The combination of the abovementioned evidence enables us to form the following outline of the evolution of Tibetan. In the 9th century, as shown by the bilingual Tibetan–Chinese treaty of 821–822 found in front of Lhasa&#x27;s Jokhang, the complex initial clusters had already been reduced, and the process of tonogenesis was likely well underway.

The next change took place in Tsang (Gtsang) dialects: The &quot;ra&quot;-tags were altered into retroflex consonants, and the &quot;ya&quot;-tags became palatals.

Later on the superscribed letters and finals &quot;d&quot; and &quot;s&quot; disappeared, except in the east and west. It was at this stage that the language spread in Lahul and Spiti, where the superscribed letters were silent, the &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot; finals were hardly heard, and &quot;as&quot;, &quot;os&quot;, &quot;us&quot; were pronounced &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;oi&quot;, &quot;ui&quot;. The words introduced from Tibet into the border languages at that time differ greatly from those borrowed at an earlier period.

Other changes are more recent and restricted to Ü and Tsang. In Ü, the vowel sounds &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot; have now mostly umlauted to &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot; when followed by the coronal sounds &quot;i&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. The same holds for Tsang with the exception of &quot;l&quot;, which merely lengthens the vowel. The medials have become aspirate tenues with a low intonation, which also marks words having a simple initial consonant; while the former aspirates and the complex initials simplified in speech are uttered with a high tone, shrill and rapidly.

==Reconstruction==
===Proto-Tibetic===
Proto-Tibetic, the hypothetical proto-language ancestral to the Tibetic languages, has been reconstructed by Tournadre (2014). Proto-Tibetic is similar to, but not identical to, written Classical Literary Tibetan. The following phonological features are characteristic of Proto-Tibetic (Tournadre 2014: 113).
*The prefixes *s(ǝ)-, *d(ǝ)-/g(ǝ)-, *m(ǝ)-, and *b(ǝ)-, which have been retained from Proto-Tibeto-Burman. *s(ǝ)- is primarily used with animals and body parts, as well as *d(ǝ)-/*g(ǝ)- and *m(ǝ)-/*r(ǝ)-.
*Palatalization of dental and alveolar consonants before &quot;y&quot; (/j/).
*Consonant change from lateral to dental position after /m/ (e.g., *ml &gt; *md).
*Distinctive aspirated initial stops. This phenomenon is attested by alternating aspirated and non-aspirated consonants in Old Tibetan orthography. Examples include gcig ~ gchig (གཅིག་ ~ གཆིག་) &#x27;one&#x27;; phyin-chad ~ phyin-cad (ཕྱིན་ཆད་ ~ ཕྱིན་ཅད་) &#x27;from now on&#x27;; ci ~ chi (ཅི་ ~ ཆི་) &#x27;what&#x27;; and cu ~ chu (ཅུ་ ~ ཆུ་) &#x27;water&#x27;.

Reconstructed Proto-Tibetic forms from Tournadre (2014) include:

* *g(ǝ)-tɕik &#x27;one&#x27;
* *g(ǝ)-nyis &#x27;two&#x27;
* *g(ǝ)-su- &#x27;three&#x27;
* *b(ǝ)-ʑi &#x27;four&#x27;
* *l(ǝ)-ŋa &#x27;five&#x27;
* *d(ǝ)-ruk &#x27;six&#x27;
* *b(ǝ)-dun &#x27;seven&#x27;
* *b(ǝ)-rgyat &#x27;eight&#x27;
* *d(ǝ)-gu &#x27;nine&#x27;
* *b(ǝ)-tɕu &#x27;ten&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-dik-pa &#x27;scorpion&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-bal &#x27;frog&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-tak &#x27;tiger&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-b-rul &#x27;snake&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-pra &#x27;monkey&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-kra &#x27;hair&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-nyiŋ &#x27;heart&#x27;
* *s(ǝ)-na &#x27;nose&#x27;
* *d(ǝ)-myik &#x27;eye&#x27;
* *m(ǝ)-go &#x27;head&#x27;
* *r(ǝ)-na &#x27;ear&#x27;
===Pre-Tibetic===
Pre-Tibetic is a hypothetical pre-formation stage of Proto-Tibetic.

*ty-, *ly-, *sy- were not palatalized in Pre-Tibetic, but underwent palatalization in Proto-Tibetic (Tournadre 2014: 113-114). Posited sound changes from Pre-Tibetic to Proto-Tibetic include *ty- &gt; *tɕ-, *sy- &gt; *ɕ-, *tsy- &gt; *tɕ-, and *ly- &gt; *ʑ-. However, Tournadre (2014: 114) notes that many Bodish languages such as Basum, Tamang, and Kurtöp (East Bodish) have not undergone these changes (e.g., Bake (Basum) &quot;ti&quot; &#x27;what&#x27; vs. Proto-Tibetic *tɕ(h)i and Bake &quot;tɨ&quot; &#x27;one&#x27; vs. Proto-Tibetic *g(ǝ)-tɕ(h)ik; Kurtöp &quot;Hla:&quot; &#x27;iron&#x27; and Bumthap &quot;lak&quot; &#x27;iron&#x27; vs. Proto-Tibetic *ltɕaks).

Some Pre-Tibetic reconstructions, along with reconstructed Proto-Tibetic forms and orthographic Classical Literary Tibetan, from Tournadre (2014: 114-116) are listed below.

<doc id="243786" wikidata="Q1333406" url="?curid=243786" title="Elsa the lioness">
<text>Elsa the lioness ( 28 January 195624 January 1961) was a female lion raised along with her sisters &quot;Big One&quot; and &quot;Lustica&quot; by game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson after they were orphaned at only a few days old. Though her two sisters eventually went to the Netherlands&#x27; Rotterdam Zoo, Elsa was trained by the Adamsons to survive on her own, and was eventually released into the wild.

Her story is told in several books by the Adamsons, as well as the 1966 motion picture &quot;Born Free&quot;.

== Life ==
Elsa and her sisters were orphaned on 1 February 1956 after George Adamson was forced to kill their mother when she charged him, in defense of her three cubs. George only later realised why the lioness had acted so aggressively towards him. George and his wife Joy then adopted the lioness&#x27;s four-day-old cubs.

While Elsa lived in many ways like a domesticated pet when she was small, Joy Adamson, whom Elsa trusted the most, considered her relationship with Elsa to be that of equals. Indeed, after sending the other two to a zoo, Joy was fiercely determined to give Elsa the education she needed to hunt and live in the wild. Her efforts paid off, earning Elsa worldwide fame at the time, when her early life’s story was published in the book &quot;Born Free&quot;. When Elsa was three years old, she brought three cubs of her own to show to the Adamsons, whom the Adamsons named &quot;Jespah&quot; (male), &quot;Gopa&quot; (male), and &quot;Little Elsa&quot; (female). The life of Elsa and her cubs is covered in the book &quot;Living Free&quot;, published not long afterwards.

Over time there was growing opposition to Elsa and the Adamsons so eventually they were told they had to relocate her and her cubs. However, before long Elsa became ill and died of a form of babesiosis, a tick-borne blood disease similar to malaria which often infects the cat family. Elsa&#x27;s grave is in the Meru National Park. After Elsa&#x27;s death the cubs were still only just over a year old and the Adamsons knew they were still too young to be able to hunt for themselves so they continued to provide goats for the cubs. However, the cubs disappeared for several weeks and were found to have been attacking goats belonging to local tribesmen. On one such raid by the cubs Jespah was hit by an arrow which fortunately was not tipped with poison but the Adamsons knew they had to find somewhere to relocate the cubs or they would almost certainly be killed.

Eventually they were given permission to move the cubs to the Serengeti National Park. After their release the Adamsons were initially allowed to continue to camp close to the release point to monitor them and continue to provide them with food to help them until they could reliably hunt for themselves. However, after a while the Park authorities decided it was time to leave the cubs to fend for themselves because of their concerns about the safety of tourists to the park being around lions who were used to humans so the Adamsons were told to leave. The Adamsons knew the cubs would most likely starve and needed more time to develop their hunting skills. However, the park authorities would not grant permission so the Adamsons were forced to break camp.

Joy Adamson then decided to pay for them to be allowed to stay on as regular park tourists but they had to stay at the designated tourist accommodation so were forced to drive out each day to find the cubs which was becoming ever more difficult. After many days of searching they finally managed to find the cubs again and spent the next few days with them. Jespah still had the arrow head in his side and the Adamsons made plans to bring along a vet and make another attempt to remove it. However, when they returned they could not find the cubs and it proved to be the last time they ever saw the cubs together though George Adamson was able to find Little Elsa, healthy and in the company of two other unrelated lions, during 19 months of subsequent searching. This was the last time that the Adamsons saw any of Elsa&#x27;s cubs.

<doc id="243788" wikidata="Q150552" url="?curid=243788" title="Franz von Papen">
<text>Franz Joseph Hermann Michael Maria von Papen, (; 29 October 18792 May 1969) was a German politician, diplomat, Prussian nobleman and General Staff officer. A national conservative, he served as the chancellor of Germany in 1932, and then as the vice-chancellor under Adolf Hitler from 1933 to 1934. Papen is largely remembered for his role in bringing Hitler to power.

Born into a wealthy, powerful and famous family of Westphalian Catholic aristocrats, Papen served in the Prussian Army from 1898 onward and was trained as a German General Staff officer. He served as military attaché in Mexico and the United States from 1913 to 1915, while also covertly organising acts of sabotage in the United States and quietly backing and financing Mexican forces in the Mexican Revolution on behalf of German military intelligence.

After being expelled as persona non grata by the United States State Department in 1915, he served as a battalion commander on the Western Front of World War I and finished his war service in the Middle Eastern theatre as a lieutenant colonel.

Asked to become chancellor of the Weimar Republic by President Paul von Hindenburg in 1932, Papen ruled by presidential decree. He launched the &quot;Preußenschlag&quot; coup against the Social Democratic Party-led Government in the Free State of Prussia. His failure to secure a base of support in the Reichstag led to his removal by Hindenburg and replacement by General Kurt von Schleicher.

Determined to return to power and regain his wealth, Papen, believing that Adolf Hitler could be controlled once he was in the government, pressured Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor and Papen as vice-chancellor in 1933 in a cabinet ostensibly not under Nazi Party domination. Seeing military dictatorship as the only alternative to a Nazi Party chancellor, Hindenburg consented. Papen and his allies were quickly marginalized by Hitler and he left the government after the Night of the Long Knives purge in 1934, during which the Nazis killed some of his allies and confidants. Subsequently, Papen served the German Foreign Office as the ambassador in Vienna from 1934 to 1938 and in Ankara from 1939 to 1944. He joined the Nazi Party in 1938.

After the Second World War, Papen was indicted for Nazi war crimes in the Nuremberg trials before the International Military Tribunal but was acquitted of all charges. In 1947, a West German denazification court found Papen to have acted as the main culprit in crimes relating to the Nazi government. Papen was given a sentence of eight years&#x27; imprisonment at hard labour, but was released on appeal in 1949. Franz von Papen&#x27;s memoirs were published in 1952 and 1953; he died in 1969.

==Early life and education==
Papen was born into a wealthy, powerful, famous and noble Catholic family in Werl, Westphalia, the third child of Friedrich von Papen-Köningen (1839–1906) and his wife Anna Laura von Steffens (1852–1939).

Papen was sent to a cadet school in Bensberg of his own volition at the age of 11 in 1891. His four years there were followed by three years of training at the in Lichterfelde. He was trained as a (&quot;gentleman rider&quot;). He served for a period as a military attendant in the Kaiser&#x27;s Palace and as a second lieutenant in his father&#x27;s old unit, the Westphalian Uhlan Regiment No. 5 in Düsseldorf. Papen joined the German General Staff as a captain in March 1913.

He married Martha von Boch-Galhau (1880–1961) on 3 May 1905. Papen&#x27;s wife was the daughter of a wealthy Saarland industrialist whose dowry made him a very rich man. An excellent horseman and a man of much charm, Papen cut a dashing figure and during this time, befriended Kurt von Schleicher. Papen was proud of his family&#x27;s having been granted hereditary rights since 1298 to mine brine salt at Werl. He always believed in the superiority of the aristocracy over commoners. Fluent in both French and English, he travelled widely all over Europe, the Middle East and North America. He was devoted to Kaiser Wilhelm II. Influenced by the books of General Friedrich von Bernhardi, Papen was a militarist throughout his life.

==Military attaché and spymaster in Washington, D.C.==
He entered the diplomatic service in December 1913 as a military attaché to the German ambassador in the United States.

In early 1914 he travelled to Mexico (to which he was also accredited) and observed the Mexican Revolution. At one time, when the anti-Huerta Zapatistas were advancing on Mexico City, Papen organised a group of European volunteers to fight for Mexican General Victoriano Huerta. In the spring of 1914, as German military attaché to Mexico, Papen was deeply involved in selling arms to the government of General Huerta, believing he could place Mexico in the German sphere of influence, though the collapse of Huerta&#x27;s regime in July 1914 ended that hope. In April 1914, Papen personally observed the United States occupation of Veracruz when the US seized the city of Veracruz, despite orders from Berlin to stay in Mexico City. During his time in Mexico, Papen acquired the love of international intrigue and adventure that characterised his later diplomatic postings in the United States, Austria and Turkey. On 30 July 1914, Papen arrived in Washington, D.C., from Mexico to take up his post as German military attaché to the United States.

During the First World War, Papen tried to buy weapons for Germany in the United States, but the British blockade made shipping arms to Germany almost impossible. On 22 August 1914, Papen hired US private detective Paul Koenig, based in New York City, to conduct a sabotage and bombing campaign against businesses in New York owned by citizens from the Allied nations. Papen, who was given an unlimited fund of cash to draw on by Berlin, attempted to block the British, French and Russian governments from buying war supplies in the United States. Papen set up a front company that tried to preclusively purchase every hydraulic press in the US for the next two years to limit artillery shell production by US firms with contracts with the Allies. To enable German citizens living in the Americas to return to Germany, Papen set up an operation in New York to forge US passports.

Starting in September 1914, Papen abused his diplomatic immunity as German military attaché, violating US laws to start organising plans for incursions into Canada for a campaign of sabotage against canals, bridges and railroads. In October 1914, Papen became involved with what was later dubbed &quot;the Hindu–German Conspiracy&quot;, by covertly arranging with Indian nationalists based in California for arms trafficking to the latter for a planned uprising against the British Raj. In February 1915, Papen also covertly organised the Vanceboro international bridge bombing, in which his diplomatic immunity protected him from arrest. At the same time, he remained involved in plans to restore Huerta to power, and arranged for the arming and financing of a planned invasion of Mexico.
Papen&#x27;s covert operations were known to British intelligence, which shared its information with the US government. As a result, for complicity in the planning of acts of sabotage on 28 December 1915, Papen was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; and recalled to Germany. Upon his return, he was awarded the Iron Cross.

Papen remained involved in covert operations in the Americas. In February 1916, he contacted Mexican Colonel Gonzalo Enrile, living in Cuba, in an attempt to arrange German support for Félix Díaz, the would-be strongman of Mexico. Papen served as an intermediary between Roger Casement of the Irish Volunteers and German naval intelligence for the purchase and delivery of arms to be used in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916. He remained involved in further covert operations with Indian nationalists as well. In April 1916, a US federal grand jury returned an indictment against Papen for a plot to blow up Canada&#x27;s Welland Canal; he remained under indictment until he became Chancellor of Germany in mid-1932, at which time the charges were dropped.

==Army service in World War I==
As a Catholic, Papen belonged to the &quot;Centre Party&quot;, the centrist party that almost all German Catholics supported, but during the course of the war, the nationalist conservative Papen became estranged from his party. Papen disapproved of Matthias Erzberger&#x27;s cooperation with Social Democrats, and regarded the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 19 July 1917 as almost treason.

Later in World War I, Papen returned to the army on active service, at first on the Western Front. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Battalion of the 93rd Reserve Infantry Regiment of the 4th Guards Infantry Division fighting in Flanders. On 22 August 1916, Papen&#x27;s battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a British attack during the Battle of the Somme. Between November 1916 – February 1917, Papen&#x27;s battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st Class. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at Vimy Ridge, where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the Canadian Corps.

After Vimy, Papen asked for a transfer to the Middle East, which was approved. From June 1917 Papen served as an officer on the General Staff in the Middle East, and then as an officer attached to the Ottoman army in Palestine. During his time in Constantinople, Papen befriended Joachim von Ribbentrop. Between October–December 1917, Papen took part in the heavy fighting in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

After the Turks signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 October 1918, the German Asia Corps was ordered home, and Papen was in the mountains at Karapinar when he heard on 11 November 1918 that the war was over. The new republic ordered soldiers&#x27; councils to be organised in the German Army, including the Asian corps, which General Otto Liman von Sanders attempted to obey, and which Papen refused to obey. Sanders ordered Papen arrested for his insubordination, which caused Papen to leave his post without permission as he fled to Germany in civilian clothing to personally meet Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who had the charges dropped.

==Catholic politician==

After leaving the German Army in the spring of 1919, Papen purchased a country estate, the , living the life of a &quot;gentleman farmer&quot; in Dülmen. In April 1920, during the Communist uprising in the Ruhr, Papen took command of a unit to protect Catholicism from the &quot;Red marauders&quot;. Impressed with his leadership of his unit, Papen was urged to pursue a career in politics. In the fall of 1920, the president of the Westphalian Farmer&#x27;s Association, Baron Engelbert von Kerkerinck zur Borg, told Papen his association would campaign for him if he ran for the Prussian .

Papen entered politics and renewed his connection with the Centre Party. As a monarchist Papen positioned himself as part of the national conservative wing of the party that rejected both republicanism and the Weimar Coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In reality, Papen&#x27;s political ideology was much closer to the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) and he seems to have belonged to the Centre Party out of loyalty to the Catholic Church in Germany and in the hope that he could shift his party&#x27;s platform towards restoring the constitutional monarchy deposed in 1918. Despite this ambiguity, Papen was undoubtedly a highly powerful dealmaker within the political party, particularly as the largest shareholder and the chief of the editorial board in the party&#x27;s Catholic newspaper , the most prestigious of the German Catholic media sources at the time.

Papen was a member of the Landtag of Prussia from 1921 to 1928 and from 1930 to 1932, representing a heavily Catholic constituency in rural Westphalia. However, he rarely attended Landtag sessions and never spoke at them during his elected mandate. He subsequently tried to have his name entered as a candidate for the Centre Party for the Reichstag elections of May 1924, but this was blocked by the party leadership. In February 1925, Papen was one of the six Centre deputies in the Landtag who voted with the German National People&#x27;s Party and the German People&#x27;s Party against the SPD-Centre coalition government. Papen was nearly expelled from the party for disobeying orders from his party leadership through his votes in the Landtag. In the 1925 presidential elections, Papen surprised his party by supporting the DNVP candidate Paul von Hindenburg over the Centre Party&#x27;s own candidate Wilhelm Marx. Papen, along with two of his future cabinet ministers, was a member of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck&#x27;s exclusive Berlin (German Gentlemen&#x27;s Club).

In March 1930, Papen welcomed the coming of presidential government. But with chancellor Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s presidential government&#x27;s dependence upon the Social Democrats in the to &quot;tolerate&quot; it by not voting to cancel laws passed under Article 48, Papen grew more critical. In a speech before a group of farmers in October 1931, Papen called for Brüning to disallow the SPD and base his presidential government on &quot;tolerance&quot; from the NSDAP instead. Papen demanded that Brüning transform the &quot;concealed dictatorship&quot; of a presidential government into a dictatorship that would unite all of the German right under its banner. In the March–April 1932 German presidential election, Papen voted for Hindenburg on the grounds he was the best man to unite the right, while in the Prussian Landtag&#x27;s election for the Landtag speaker, Papen voted for the Nazi Hans Kerrl.

==Chancellorship==
On 1 June 1932, Papen was suddenly promoted to high office when President Hindenburg appointed him chancellor, an appointment he owed to General Kurt von Schleicher, an old friend from the pre-war General Staff, and an influential advisor of President Hindenburg. Schleicher selected Papen because his conservative, aristocratic background and military career made him acceptable to Hindenburg and would create the groundwork for a possible coalition between the Centre Party and the Nazis. It was Schleicher, who himself became Defence Minister, who was responsible for selecting the entire cabinet. The day before, Papen had promised party chairman Ludwig Kaas he would not accept any appointment. After Papen broke his pledge, Kaas branded him the &quot;Ephialtes of the Centre Party&quot;, after the infamous traitor of the Battle of Thermopylae. On 31 May 1932, in order to forestall being expelled from the party, Papen resigned from it.

The cabinet over which Papen presided was labelled the &quot;cabinet of barons&quot; or &quot;cabinet of monocles&quot;. Papen had little support in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;; the only parties committed to supporting him were the national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) and the conservative liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP). The Centre Party refused its support for him on account of his betrayal of Chancellor Brüning. Schleicher&#x27;s planned Centre-Nazi coalition thus failed to materialize, and the Nazis now had little reason to prop up Papen&#x27;s weak government. Papen grew very close to Hindenburg and first met Adolf Hitler in June 1932.
Papen consented on 31 May to Hitler&#x27;s and Hindenburg&#x27;s agreement of 30 May that the Nazi Party would tolerate Papen&#x27;s government if fresh elections were called, the ban on the SA cancelled, and the Nazis granted access to the radio network. As agreed, the Papen government dissolved the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on 4 June and called a national election by 31 July 1932, in the hope that the Nazis would win the largest number of seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, which would allow him the majority he needed to establish an authoritarian government. In a so-called &quot;presidential government&quot;, Papen would rule by Article 48, having emergency decrees signed by President Hindenburg. On 16 June 1932, the new government lifted the ban on the SA and the SS, eliminating the last remaining rationale for Nazi support for Papen.
In June and July 1932, Papen represented Germany at the Lausanne conference where, on 9 July, an agreement was reached for Germany to make a one-time payment of 3 million Reichsmarks in bonds to the Bank for International Settlements. The redemption of the bonds, which would not start for at least three years, was to be the last of Germany&#x27;s reparations payments. Papen nevertheless immediately repudiated the commitment upon his return to Berlin. The treaty signed at the Lausanne Conference was not ratified by any of the countries involved, and Germany never resumed paying reparations after the expiration of the Hoover Moratorium in 1932.

Through Article 48, Papen enacted on 4 September economic policies that cut the payments offered by the unemployment insurance fund, subjected jobless Germans seeking unemployment insurance to a means test, and lowered wages (including those reached by collective bargaining), while arranging tax cuts for corporations and the rich. These austerity policies made Papen deeply unpopular with the general population but had the backing of the business elite.

Negotiations between the Nazis, the Centre Party, and Papen for a new Prussian government began on 8 June but broke down due to the Centre Party&#x27;s hostility to its deserter Papen. On 11 July 1932 Papen received the support of the cabinet and the President for a decree allowing the national government to take over the Prussian government, which was dominated by the SPD. This move was later justified through the false rumour that the Social Democrats and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) were planning a merger. The political violence of the so-called Altona Bloody Sunday clash between Nazis, Communists, and the police on 17 July, gave Papen his pretext. On 20 July, Papen launched a coup against the SPD coalition government of Prussia in the so-called (Prussian Coup). Berlin was put on military lockdown, and Papen informed the members of the Prussian cabinet that they were being removed from office. Papen declared himself Commissioner () of Prussia by way of another emergency decree that he elicited from Hindenburg, further weakening the democracy of the Weimar Republic. Papen viewed the coup as a gift to the Nazis, who had been informed of it by 9 July, and were now supposed to support his government.

On 23 July, Papen instructed German representatives to walk out of the World Disarmament Conference after the French delegation warned that allowing Germany (&quot;equality of status&quot;) in armaments would lead to another world war. Papen stated that Germany would not return to the conference until the other powers agreed to consider his demand for equal status.
In the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 31 July the Nazis won the largest number of seats. To combat the rise in SA and SS political terrorism that began right after the elections, Papen on 9 August brought in via Article 48 a new law that drastically streamlined the judicial process in death penalty cases while limiting the right of appeal. New special courts were also created. A few hours later in the town of Potempa, five SA men murdered Communist labourer Konrad Pietrzuch. The &quot;Potempa Five&quot; were promptly arrested, then convicted and sentenced to death on 23 August by a special court. The Potempa case generated enormous media attention, and Hitler made it clear that he would not support Papen&#x27;s government if the &quot;Five&quot; were executed. On 2 September, Papen in his capacity as Commissioner of Prussia acquiesced to Hitler&#x27;s demands and commuted the sentences of the &quot;Five&quot; to life imprisonment.

On 11 August, the public holiday of Constitution Day, which commemorated the adoption of the Weimar Constitution in 1919, Papen and his Interior Minister Baron Wilhelm von Gayl called a press conference to announce plans for a new constitution that would, in effect, turn Germany into a dictatorship. Two days later, Schleicher and Papen offered the position of vice-chancellor to Hitler, who rejected it.
When the new &quot;Reichstag&quot; assembled on 12 September, Papen hoped to destroy the growing alliance between the Nazis and the Centre Party. That day at the President&#x27;s estate in Neudeck, Papen, Schleicher, and Gayl obtained in advance from Hindenburg a decree to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, then secured another decree to suspend elections beyond the constitutional 60 days. The Communists tabled a motion of no confidence in the Papen government. Papen had anticipated this move by the Communists, but had been assured that there would be an immediate objection. However, when no one objected, Papen placed the red folder containing the dissolution decree on &quot;Reichstag&quot; president Hermann Göring&#x27;s desk. He demanded the floor in order to read it, but Göring pretended not to see him; the Nazis and the Centre Party had decided to support the Communist motion. The motion carried by 512 votes to 42. Realizing that he did not have nearly enough support to go through with his plan to suspend elections, Papen decided to call another election to punish the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for the vote of no-confidence.
On 27 October, the Supreme Court of Germany issued a ruling that Papen&#x27;s coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal, but allowed Papen to retain control of Prussia. In November 1932, Papen violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by approving a program of refurbishment for the German Navy of an aircraft carrier, six battleships, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, and 16 submarines, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic.

In the November 1932 election, the Nazis lost seats, but Papen was still unable to secure a &quot;Reichstag&quot; that could be counted on not to pass another vote of no-confidence in his government. Papen&#x27;s attempt to negotiate with Hitler failed. Under pressure from Schleicher, Papen resigned on 17 November and formed a caretaker government. He told his cabinet that he planned to have martial law declared, which would allow him to rule as a dictator. However, at a cabinet meeting on 2 December, Papen was informed by Schleicher&#x27;s associate General Eugen Ott about the dubious results of &quot;Reichswehr&quot; war games, that showed there was no way to maintain order against the Nazis and Communists. Realizing that Schleicher was moving to replace him, Papen asked Hindenburg to dismiss Schleicher as Defence Minister. Instead, Hindenburg appointed Schleicher as chancellor.

==Bringing Hitler to power==
After his resignation, Papen regularly visited Hindenburg, missing no opportunity to attack Schleicher in these visits. Schleicher had promised Hindenburg that he would never attack Papen in public when he became chancellor, but in a bid to distance himself from the very unpopular Papen, Schleicher in a series of speeches in December 1932 – January 1933 did just that, upsetting Hindenburg. Papen was embittered by the way his former best friend, Schleicher, had brought him down, and was determined to become chancellor again. On 4 January 1933, Hitler and Papen met in secret at the banker Kurt Baron von Schröder&#x27;s house in Cologne to discuss a common strategy against Schleicher.

On 9 January 1933, Papen and Hindenburg agreed to form a new government that would bring in Hitler. On the evening of 22 January in a meeting at the villa of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin, Papen made the concession of abandoning his claim to the chancellorship and committed to support Hitler as chancellor in a proposed &quot;Government of National Concentration&quot;, in which Papen would serve as vice-chancellor and Minister-President of Prussia. On 23 January, Papen presented to Hindenburg his idea for Hitler to be made chancellor, while keeping him &quot;boxed&quot; in. On the same day Schleicher, to avoid a vote of no-confidence in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; when it reconvened on 31 January, asked the president to declare a state of emergency. Hindenburg declined and Schleicher resigned at midday on 28 January. Hindenburg formally gave Papen the task of forming a new government.
In the morning of 29 January, Papen met with Hitler and Hermann Göring at his apartment, where it was agreed that Papen would serve as vice-chancellor and Commissioner for Prussia. It was in the same meeting that Papen first learned that Hitler wanted to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot; when he became chancellor and, once the Nazis had won a majority of the seats in the ensuing elections, to activate the Enabling Act in order to be able to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag. When the people around Papen voiced their concerns about putting Hitler in power, he asked them, &quot;What do you want?&quot; and reassured them, &quot;I have the confidence of Hindenburg! In two months, we&#x27;ll have pushed Hitler so far into the corner that he&#x27;ll squeal.&quot;

Editor-in-Chief Theodor Wolff commented in an editorial in the &quot;Berliner Tagblatt&quot; on January 29, 1933: &quot;The strongest natures, those with the iron forehead or the board before the head, will insist on the anti-parliamentary solution, on the closing of the Reichstag House, on the coup d&#x27;état.&quot;

In the end, the president, who had previously vowed never to let Hitler become chancellor, appointed Hitler to the post at 11:30 am on 30 January 1933, with Papen as vice-chancellor. While Papen&#x27;s intrigues appeared to have brought Hitler into power, the crucial dynamic was in fact provided by the Nazi Party&#x27;s electoral support, which made military dictatorship the only alternative to Nazi rule for Hindenburg and his circle.

At the formation of Hitler&#x27;s cabinet on 30 January, only three Nazis held cabinet portfolios: Hitler, Göring, and Wilhelm Frick. The other eight posts were held by conservatives close to Papen, including the DNVP chairman, Alfred Hugenberg. Additionally, as part of the deal that allowed Hitler to become chancellor, Papen was granted the right to attend every meeting between Hitler and Hindenburg. Moreover, cabinet decisions were made by majority vote. Papen naively believed that his conservative friends&#x27; majority in the cabinet and his closeness to Hindenburg would keep Hitler in check.

==Vice-chancellor==
Hitler and his allies instead quickly marginalised Papen and the rest of the cabinet. For example, as part of the deal between Hitler and Papen, Göring had been appointed interior minister of Prussia, thus putting the largest police force in Germany under Nazi control. Göring frequently acted without consulting his nominal superior, Papen. On 1 February 1933, Hitler presented to the cabinet an Article 48 decree law that had been drafted by Papen in November 1932 allowing the police to take people into &quot;protective custody&quot; without charges. It was signed into law by Hindenburg on 4 February as the &quot;Decree for the Protection of the German People&quot;.

On the evening of 27 February 1933, Papen joined Hitler, Göring and Goebbels at the burning &quot;Reichstag&quot; and told him that he shared their belief that this was the signal for Communist revolution. On 18 March 1933, in his capacity as &quot;Reich&quot; Commissioner for Prussia, Papen freed the &quot;Potempa Five&quot; under the grounds the murder of Konrad Pietzuch was an act of self-defense, making the five SA men &quot;innocent victims&quot; of a miscarriage of justice. Neither Papen nor his conservative allies waged a fight against the &quot;Reichstag&quot; Fire Decree in late February or the Enabling Act in March. After the Enabling Act was passed, serious deliberations more or less ceased at cabinet meetings when they took place at all, which subsequently neutralised Papen&#x27;s attempt to &quot;box&quot; Hitler in through cabinet-based decision-making.

At the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 5 March 1933, Papen was elected as a deputy in an electoral alliance with Hugenberg&#x27;s DNVP. Papen endorsed Hitler&#x27;s plan, presented at a cabinet meeting on 7 March 1933, to destroy the Centre Party by severing the Catholic Church from it. This was the origin of the that Papen was to negotiate with the Catholic Church later in the spring of 1933. On 5 April 1933, Papen founded a new political party called the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle, which was intended as a conservative Catholic party that would hold the NSDAP in check while at the same time working with the NSDAP. Both the Centre Party and the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party declined to merge into Papen&#x27;s new party while the rival Coalition of Catholic Germans, which was sponsored by the NSDAP, proved more effective at recruiting German Catholics.
On 8 April Papen travelled to the Vatican to offer a that defined the German state&#x27;s relationship with the Catholic Church. During his stay in Rome, Papen met the Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini and failed to persuade him to drop his support for the Austrian chancellor Dollfuss. Papen was euphoric at the that he negotiated with Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli in Rome, believing that this was a diplomatic success that restored his status in Germany, guaranteed the rights of German Catholics in the Third Reich, and required the disbandment of the Centre Party and the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, thereby achieving one of Papen&#x27;s main political goals since June 1932. During Papen&#x27;s absence, the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Prussia elected Göring as prime minister on 10 April. Papen saw the end of the Centre Party that he had engineered as one of his greatest achievements. Later in May 1933, he was forced to disband the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle owing to lack of public interest.
In September 1933, Papen visited Budapest to meet the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös, and to discuss how Germany and Hungary might best co-operate against Czechoslovakia. The Hungarians wanted the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic German) minorities in the Banat, Transylvania, Slovakia and Carpathia to agitate to return to Hungary in co-operation with the Magyar minorities, a demand that Papen refused to meet. In September 1933, when the Soviet Union ended its secret military co-operation with Germany, the Soviets justified their move under the grounds that Papen had informed the French of the Soviet support for German violations of the Versailles Treaty.

On 3 October 1933, Papen was named a member of the Academy for German Law at its inaugural meeting. Then, on 14 November 1933, Papen was appointed the &quot;Reich&quot; Commissioner for the Saar. The Saarland was under the rule of the League of Nations and a referendum was scheduled for 1935 under which the Saarlanders had the option to return to Germany, join France, or retain the status quo. As a conservative Catholic whose wife was from the Saarland, Papen had much understanding of the heavily Catholic region, and he gave numerous speeches urging the Saarlanders to vote to return to Germany. Papen was successful in persuading the majority of the Catholic clergy in the Saarland to campaign for a return to Germany, and 90% of the Saarland voted to return to Germany in the 1935 referendum.

Papen began covert talks with other conservative forces with the aim of convincing Hindenburg to restore the balance of power back to the conservatives. By May 1934, it had become clear that Hindenburg was dying, with doctors telling Papen that the president only had a few months left to live. Papen together with Otto Meissner, Hindenburg&#x27;s chief of staff, and Major Oskar von Hindenburg, Hindenburg&#x27;s son, drafted a &quot;political will and last testament&quot;, which the president signed on 11 May 1934. At Papen&#x27;s request, the will called for the dismissal of certain Nazi ministers from the cabinet, and regular cabinet meetings, which would have achieved Papen&#x27;s plan of January 1933 for a broad governing coalition of the right.

=== The Marburg speech ===

With the Army command recently having hinted at the need for Hitler to control the SA, Papen delivered an address at the University of Marburg on 17 June 1934 where he called for the restoration of some freedoms, demanded an end to the calls for a &quot;second revolution&quot; and advocated the cessation of SA terror in the streets. Papen intended to &quot;tame&quot; Hitler with the Marburg speech, and gave the speech without any effort at co-ordination beforehand with either Hindenburg or the . The speech was crafted by Papen&#x27;s speech writer, Edgar Julius Jung, with the assistance of Papen&#x27;s secretary Herbert von Bose and Catholic leader Erich Klausener, and Papen had first seen the text of the speech only two hours before he delivered it at the University of Marburg. The &quot;Marburg speech&quot; was well received by the graduating students of Marburg university who all loudly cheered the vice-chancellor. Extracts were reproduced in the , the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, and from there picked up by the foreign press.

The speech incensed Hitler, and its publication was suppressed by the Propaganda Ministry. Papen told Hitler that unless the ban on the Marburg speech was lifted and Hitler declared himself willing to follow the line recommended by Papen in the speech, he would resign and would inform Hindenburg why he had resigned. Hitler outwitted Papen by telling him that he agreed with all of the criticism of his regime made in the Marburg speech; told him Goebbels was wrong to ban the speech and he would have the ban lifted at once; and promised that the SA would be put in their place, provided Papen agreed not to resign and would meet with Hindenburg in a joint interview with him. Papen accepted Hitler&#x27;s suggestions.

=== Night of the Long Knives ===
Two weeks after the Marburg speech, Hitler responded to the armed forces&#x27; demands to suppress the ambitions of Ernst Röhm and the SA by purging the SA leadership. The purge, known as the Night of the Long Knives, took place between 30 June and 2 July 1934. Though Papen&#x27;s bold speech against some of the excesses committed by the Nazis had angered Hitler, the latter was aware that he could not act directly against the vice-chancellor without offending Hindenburg. Instead, in the Night of the Long Knives, the Vice-Chancellery, Papen&#x27;s office, was ransacked by the (SS); his associates Herbert von Bose, Erich Klausener and Edgar Julius Jung were shot. Papen himself was placed under house arrest at his villa with his telephone line cut. Some accounts indicate that this &quot;protective custody&quot; was ordered by Göring, who felt the ex-diplomat could be useful in the future.

Reportedly Papen arrived at the Chancellery, exhausted from days of house arrest without sleep, to find the chancellor seated with other Nazi ministers around a round table, with no place for Papen but a hole in the middle. He insisted on a private audience with Hitler and announced his resignation, stating, &quot;My service to the Fatherland is over!&quot; The following day, Papen&#x27;s resignation as vice-chancellor was formally accepted and publicised, with no successor appointed. When Hindenburg died on 2 August, the last conservative obstacle to complete Nazi rule was gone.

==Ambassador to Austria==

Hitler offered Papen the assignment of German ambassador to Vienna, which Papen accepted. Papen was a German nationalist who always believed that Austria was destined to join Germany in an &quot;Anschluss&quot; (annexation), and felt that a success in bringing that about might restore his career. During his time as ambassador to Austria, Papen stood outside the normal chain of command of the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; (Foreign Office) as he refused to take orders from Konstantin von Neurath, his own former Foreign Minister. Instead, Papen reported directly to Hitler.

Papen met often with Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg to assure him that Germany did not wish to annex his country, and only wanted the banned Austrian Nazi Party to participate in Austrian politics. In late 1934-early 1935, Papen took a break from his duties as German ambassador in Vienna to lead the &quot;Deutsche Front&quot; (&quot;German Front&quot;) in the Saarland plebiscite on 13 January 1935, where the League of Nations observers monitoring the vote noted Papen&#x27;s &quot;ruthless methods&quot; as he campaigned for the region to return to Germany.
Papen also contributed to achieving Hitler&#x27;s goal of undermining Austrian sovereignty and bringing about the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian government, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on Germany&#x27;s. Papen played a major role in negotiating the 1936 Austro-German agreement under which Austria declared itself a &quot;German state&quot; whose foreign policy would always be aligned with Berlin&#x27;s and allowed for members of the &quot;national opposition&quot; to enter the Austrian cabinet in exchange for which the Austrian Nazis abandoned their terrorist campaign against the government. The treaty Papen signed in Vienna on 11 July 1936 promised that Germany would not seek to annex Austria and largely placed Austria in the German sphere of influence, greatly reducing Italian influence on Austria. In July 1936, Papen reported to Hitler that the Austro-German treaty he had just signed was the &quot;decisive step&quot; towards ending Austrian independence, and it was only a matter of time before the &quot;Anschluss&quot; took place.

In the summer and fall of 1937, Papen pressured the Austrians to include more Nazis in the government. In September 1937, Papen returned to Berlin when Benito Mussolini visited Germany, serving as Hitler&#x27;s adviser on Italo-German talks about Austria. Papen joined the Nazi Party in 1938. Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, but Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden. The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg at the meeting on 12 February 1938 led to the Austrian government&#x27;s capitulation to German threats and pressure, and paved the way for the Anschluss that year.

==Ambassador to Turkey==
Papen later served the German government as Ambassador to Turkey from 1939 to 1944. In April 1938, after the retirement of the previous ambassador, Friedrich von Keller on his 65th birthday, the German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop attempted to appoint Papen as ambassador in Ankara, but the appointment was vetoed by the Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste when he had served alongside him in World War I. In November 1938 and in February 1939, the new Turkish president General İsmet İnönü again vetoed Ribbentrop&#x27;s attempts to have Papen appointed as German ambassador to Turkey. In April 1939, Turkey accepted Papen as ambassador. Papen was keen to return to Turkey, where he had served during World War I.

Papen arrived in Turkey on 27 April 1939, just after the signing of a UK-Turkish declaration of friendship. İnönü wanted Turkey to join the UK-inspired &quot;peace front&quot; that was meant to stop Germany. On 24 June 1939, France and Turkey signed a declaration committing them to upholding collective security in the Balkans. On 21 August 1939, Papen presented Turkey with a diplomatic note threatening economic sanctions and the cancellation of all arms contracts if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the UK-French &quot;peace front&quot;, a threat that Turkey rebuffed.

On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and two days later on 3 September 1939 the UK and France declared war on Germany. Papen claimed later to have been opposed to Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy in 1939, and was very depressed when he heard the news of the German attack on Poland on the radio. Papen continued his work of representing the &quot;Reich&quot; in Turkey under the grounds that resigning in protest &quot;would indicate the moral weakening in Germany&quot;, which was something he could never do.

On 19 October 1939, Papen suffered a notable setback when Turkey signed a treaty of alliance with France and the UK. During the Phoney War, the conservative Catholic Papen found himself to his own discomfort working together with Soviet diplomats in Ankara to pressure Turkey not to enter the war on the Allied side. In June 1940, with France&#x27;s defeat, İnönü abandoned his pro-Allied neutrality, and Papen&#x27;s influence in Ankara dramatically increased.

Between 1940 and 1942 Papen signed three economic agreements that placed Turkey in the German economic sphere of influence. Papen hinted more than once to Turkey that Germany was prepared to support Bulgarian claims to Thrace if Turkey did not prove more accommodating to Germany. In May 1941, when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the UK in the Anglo-Iraqi War, Papen persuaded Turkey to allow arms in Syria to be shipped along a railroad linking Syria to Iraq. In June 1941, Papen successfully negotiated a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with Turkey, signed on 17 June 1941, which prevented Turkey from entering the war on the Allied side. After Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941, Papen persuaded Turkey to close the Turkish straits to Soviet warships, but was unable to have the straits closed to Soviet merchant ships as he demanded.

Papen claimed after the war to have done everything within his power to save Turkish Jews living in countries occupied by Germany from deportation to the death camps, but an examination of the records does not support him. During the war, Papen used his connections with Turkish Army officers with whom he served in World War I to try to influence Turkey into joining the Axis, held parties at the German embassy which were attended by leading Turkish politicians and used &quot;special funds&quot; to bribe Turks into following a pro-German line. As an ambassador to Turkey, Papen survived a Soviet assassination attempt on 24 February 1942 by agents from the NKVD: a bomb exploded prematurely, killing the bomber and no one else, although Papen was slightly injured. In 1943, Papen frustrated a UK attempt to have Turkey join the war on the Allied side by getting Hitler to send a letter to Inönü assuring him that Germany had no interest in invading Turkey and by threatening to have the Luftwaffe bomb Istanbul if Turkey joined the Allies.

In the summer and fall of 1943, realizing the war was lost, Papen attended secret meetings with the agents of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Istanbul. Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for US support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt rejected the offer when he heard of it and told the OSS to stop talking to Papen. From October 1943, Papen and the German embassy gained access to the &quot;Cicero&quot; documents of secret agent Elyesa Bazna, including information and the Tehran Conference, which Papen revealed selectively to Inönu to strain Allied-Turkish relations. In January 1944, Papen, after learning via the &quot;Cicero&quot; documents of a UK plan to have the Royal Air Force use airfields in Turkey to bomb the oil fields of Ploiești in Romania, told the Turkish foreign minister Hüseyin Numan Menemencioğlu that if Turkey allowed the RAF to use Turkish air fields to bomb Ploiești, the Luftwaffe would use its bases in Bulgaria and Greece to bomb and destroy Istanbul and Izmir.

On 20 April 1944, Turkey, wishing to ingratiate itself with the Allies, ceased selling chromium to Germany. On 26 May 1944 Menemencioğlu announced that Turkey was reducing exports to Germany by 50%, and on 2 August 1944 Turkey severed diplomatic relations with Germany, forcing Papen to return to Berlin. After Pope Pius XI died in February 1939, his successor Pope Pius XII did not renew Papen&#x27;s honorary title of &quot;Papal chamberlain&quot;. As nuncio, the future Pope John XXIII, Angelo Roncalli, became acquainted with Papen in Greece and Turkey during World War II. The German government considered appointing Papen ambassador to the Holy See, but Pope Pius XII, after consulting Konrad von Preysing, Bishop of Berlin, rejected this proposal. In August 1944, Papen had his last meeting with Hitler after arriving back in Germany from Turkey. Here, Hitler awarded Papen the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the War Merit Cross. In September 1944, Papen settled at his estate at Wallerfangen in the Saarland that had been given to him by his father-in-law. On 29 November 1944, Papen could hear in the distance the guns of the advancing US Third Army, which caused him and his family to flee deeper into Germany.

==Post-war years==

Papen was captured along with his son Franz Jr. at his own home on 14 April 1945. Papen was forced by the US to visit a concentration camp to see firsthand the nature of the regime he had fostered and served from start to finish.
Papen was one of the defendants at the main Nuremberg War Crimes Trial. The investigating tribunal found no solid evidence to support claims that Papen had been involved in the annexation of Austria. The court acquitted him, stating that while he had committed a number of &quot;political immoralities&quot;, these actions were not punishable under the &quot;conspiracy to commit crimes against peace&quot; written in Papen&#x27;s indictment. The Soviets wanted to execute him.

Papen was subsequently sentenced to eight years&#x27; hard labour by a West German denazification court, but he was released on appeal in 1949. Until 1954, Papen was forbidden to publish in West Germany, and so he wrote a series of articles in newspapers in Spain, attacking the Federal Republic from a conservative Catholic position in much the same terms that he had attacked the Weimar Republic.

Papen unsuccessfully tried to restart his political career in the 1950s; he lived at the Castle of Benzenhofen near Ravensburg in Upper Swabia. Pope John XXIII restored his title of &quot;Papal Chamberlain&quot; on 24 July 1959. Papen was also a Knight of Malta, and he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Pontifical Order of Pius IX.
Papen published a number of books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early Western Cold War politics. Papen praised the Schuman Plan to pacify relations between France and West Germany as &quot;wise and statesmanlike&quot; and claimed to believe in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe. In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland.

Right up until his death in 1969, Papen gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers, defending himself against the charge that he had played a crucial role in having Hitler appointed chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime; these led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists. Franz von Papen died in Obersasbach, West Germany, on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.

<text>A system context diagram in engineering is a diagram that defines the boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it. This diagram is a high level view of a system. It is similar to a block diagram.

== Overview == 
System context diagrams show a system, as a whole and its inputs and outputs from/to external factors. According to Kossiakoff and Sweet (2011): 
System context diagrams are used early in a project to get agreement on the scope under investigation. Context diagrams are typically included in a requirements document. These diagrams must be read by all project stakeholders and thus should be written in plain language, so the stakeholders can understand items within the document.

== Building blocks ==
Context diagrams can be developed with the use of two types of building blocks:
* &quot;Entities (Actors)&quot;: labeled boxes; one in the center representing the system, and around it multiple boxes for each external actor
* &quot;Relationships&quot;: labeled lines between the entities and system

For example, &quot;customer places order.&quot; Context diagrams can also use many different drawing types to represent external entities. They can use ovals, stick figures, pictures, clip art or any other representation to convey meaning. Decision trees and data storage are represented in system flow diagrams.

A context diagram can also list the classifications of the external entities as one of a set of simple categories (Examples:), which add clarity to the level of involvement of the entity with regards to the system. These categories include:
* &quot;Active&quot;: Dynamic to achieve some goal or purpose (Examples: &quot;Article readers&quot; or &quot;customers&quot;).
* &quot;Passive&quot;: Static external entities which infrequently interact with the system (Examples: &quot;Article editors&quot; or &quot;database administrator&quot;).
* &quot;Cooperative&quot;: Predictable external entities which are used by the system to bring about some desired outcome (Examples: &quot;Internet service providers&quot; or &quot;shipping companies&quot;).
* &quot;Autonomous (Independent)&quot;: External entities which are separated from the system, but affect the system indirectly, by means of imposed constraints or similar influences (Examples: &quot;regulatory committees&quot; or &quot;standards groups&quot;).

== Alternatives ==
The best system context diagrams are used to display how a system interoperates at a very high level, or how systems operate and interact logically. The system context diagram is a necessary tool in developing a baseline interaction between systems and actors; actors and a system or systems and systems. Alternatives to the system context diagram are:
* &quot;Architecture Interconnect Diagram&quot;: The figure gives an example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram: A representation of the Albuquerque regional ITS architecture interconnects for the Albuquerque Police Department that was generated using the Turbo Architecture tool is shown in the figure. Each block represents an ITS inventory element, including the name of the stakeholder in the top shaded portion. The interconnect lines between elements are solid or dashed, indicating existing or planned connections.
* &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm&#x27;s value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances.[1] It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.
* &quot;Enterprise data model&quot;: this type of data model according to Simsion (2005) can contain up to 50 to 200 entity classes, which results from specific &quot;high level of generalization in data modeling&quot;.
* &quot;IDEF0 Top Level Context Diagram&quot;: The IDEF0 process starts with the identification of the prime function to be decomposed. This function is identified on a &quot;Top Level Context Diagram&quot; that defines the scope of the particular IDEF0 analysis.
* &quot;Problem Diagrams (Problem Frames)&quot;: In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows requirements and requirements references.
* &quot;Use case diagram&quot;: One of the Unified Modeling Language diagrams. They also represent the scope of the project at a similar level of abstraction. - Use Cases, however, tend to focus more on the goals of &#x27;actors&#x27; who interact with the system, and do not specify any solution. Use Case diagrams represent a set of Use Cases, which are textual descriptions of how an actor achieves the goal of a use case. for Example Customer Places Order.
* &quot;ArchiMate&quot;: ArchiMate is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains in an unambiguous way.

Most of these diagrams work well as long as a limited number of interconnects will be shown. Where twenty or more interconnects must be displayed, the diagrams become quite complex and can be difficult to read.

<doc id="243796" wikidata="Q1249513" url="?curid=243796" title="Studio Ironcat">
<text>Studio Ironcat was a small publishing company based in Fredericksburg, Virginia, dedicated to publication of manga and later, Amerimanga. The company is most known for its publication of the first volume of &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, a prominent webcomic, as well as the flamboyant style of one of its founders, Steve Bennett. The company was also known for regular turmoil within its wake, primarily during the years 2001–2003. One of these led to a period where the company did business under a different name as I.C. Entertainment.

The company, commonly referred to as &quot;Ironcat&quot;, published under the Studio Ironcat, I.C. Entertainment and Fuzzy Kitten imprints. They also had an adult imprint, Sexy Fruit. Over the course of its lifespan, Studio Ironcat published over fifty titles.

==History==

===Founding years===
From 1993 to 1997, Antarctic Press published several translated manga series, including Vampire Miyu and several miniseries by Ippongi Bang and her studio, Studio DoDo. However, facing declining sales and a change in the company&#x27;s focus, Antarctic Press decided to cancel all of their translated manga titles in late 1997, laying off several employees in the process. One of the employees let go from Antarctic Press was head translator Kumi Kimura, who took several projects that had been in the planning stages to his new company, Studio Ironcat. Studio Ironcat was founded in 1997 by manga artists Kuni Kimura, Masaomi Kanzaki and Stephen R. Bennett IV. The new company started publication in January of the following year by releasing the &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; manga by Narumi Kakinouchi, then moving on to a series of other books under its Studio Ironcat and Sexy Fruit imprints. The company signed up other well-known artists and titles, working to become a strong player in the shōnen manga genre.

For the first few years of business, things were running somewhat smoothly, but this changed in 1999, with the first major problem for Ironcat.

===Embezzlement and departure of co-founders===
From its inception until 1999, there were financial issues with Kimura. A report by industry website Anime News Network (ANN) stated that a company employee reported multiple cases of fraud by Kimura, with the alleged cases of Ironcat funds being given to friends in Japan, took unauthorized trips to Thailand and frequently used company finances for personal expenses. The drain of funds was enough that the company ended up on shaky financial ground, and emptied Kanzaki (the primary financial backer)&#x27;s investment in the company.

During the post-Kimura restructuring by Kanzaki and the Bennetts, Office assistant Kathryn Hofer left in January 2000 due to lack of pay and bias treatment, Chief Graphics Designer and Copy Editor Mark Hofmann departed in June 2000, citing an issue with internal, &quot;high-school&quot; company politics and lack of pay. Hofer&#x27;s and Hofman&#x27;s grievances would later prove to be tragically prophetic, as later employee departures would cite the same problems.

===Name change and employee departures===

The Bennetts responded by renaming the company International Comics and Entertainment, but it is unclear if the name change was simply a DBA, or a change to evoke &quot;Iron Cat Entertainment&quot;. For the most part, rebranding the company as I.C. Entertainment was cosmetic, as the company was still referred to as &quot;Ironcat&quot; during this period. In 2002, the company expanded its lineup to include shōjo manga titles, such as &quot;Central City&quot; and horror titles such as &quot;Mantis Woman&quot;. From this point on, a slow exodus of staff departed the company. Between May and August 2003, several key personnel departed the company, with one of the biggest departures occurring on July 31 (though not reported until October 6 of that year). 

On October 6, 2003, Brown, Johnson, and Graphics Editor Ellen Ohlmacher gave an interview to ANN, accusing Bennett of denying pay to themselves and several other company employees. A follow-up report by ANN stated that &quot;[f]inancial documents obtained by ANN demonstrate a three-month gap in one employee&#x27;s payment from March 31 to July 3, followed in September by back pay of only one-third of the $1,800 the employee claims to be owed. The records also indicate other former employees have not received some or all of their claimed back pay.&quot; ANN later reported both Brown and Johnson eventually received full back pay as of October 27, though it is unknown if anyone else had received their missing pay.

As Ironcat&#x27;s finances deteriorated and internal politics began to leak to the public, the company gained a reputation as a hotbed of &quot;chaos&quot;, filled with &quot;high-school politics&quot; amongst staffmembers. At one point the company held a &quot;Save Ironcat&quot; sale at the 2003 Otakon anime convention. During this time, the company returned to the Studio Ironcat name in October 2003, having settled amicably with Kanzaki over the name and other issues.

===&quot;Megatokyo&quot; and Amerimanga===
By mid-2002, the decision was made to get into the growing Amerimanga trend pioneered by competitor Antarctic Press and made notable at the time by TOKYOPOP&#x27;s &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot; contest and compilation. This was brought about by Ironcat&#x27;s biggest coup, obtaining the publishing licenses for &quot;Megatokyo&quot; and Maelyn Dean&#x27;s &quot;Real Life&quot;, two major webcomics. It also began publishing an Amerimanga anthology magazine called, fittingly, &quot;AmeriManga&quot;.

However, the Amerimanga ventures turned out to be disastrous. The first volume of &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, released in January 2003, was a bonafide hit, with the entire first printing selling out. Ironcat prepared for the release of the second volume when the publishing deal between Ironcat and Fred Gallagher, &quot;Megatokyo&quot;&#x27;s creator, fell through. Gallagher would later write on the Megatokyo web site that the parting between him and Ironcat was amicable, though rumors had it that Bennett stated that Gallagher demanded more money for the license. However, many &quot;Megatokyo&quot; fans noted that Ironcat never shipped out many of their pre-orders for Vol. 1 and also insisted that fans pay in full for pre-orders on Vol. 2 when it had not even gone to press. Gallagher would eventually take Megatokyo to rival publisher Dark Horse Comics.

===&quot;AmeriManga&quot; magazine and author strife===
By June of that year, however, &quot;AmeriManga&quot; magazine had become the focal point of Ironcat&#x27;s products and a modest hit, boasting a subscription of 600 subscribers. However, at AnimeNEXT, on October 4 of that year, Bennett announced that &quot;AmeriManga&quot; would go on hiatus, and that it was awaiting responses from the represented artists before proceeding with plans for future issues.

However, while Ironcat had expressed an interest in continuing the series, it would have been difficult as Senior Editor Kei Blue had departed the company in July, and fourteen other &quot;AmeriManga&quot; artists followed suit. Blue told ANN that a clause specifying a timetable for product release and payment was included in the &quot;AmeriManga&quot; artists&#x27; contracts, and that when Ironcat failed to meet the timetable, the contracts were automatically voided. Afterwards, several artists publicly stated that they would not work with Ironcat again.

Additionally, Ironcat began to have problems with some of their other artists. The deal with Dean fell through, with Dean opting not to publish &quot;Real Life&quot; with Ironcat. A more public disagreement occurred when Bennett stated that Ironcat could not contact Japanese artist Saya, creator of &quot;Central City&quot;, blaming it on an ex-employee who allegedly took the artist&#x27;s information. In turn, Saya made a public statement, voicing that she was easily able to be contacted via her website, that she had never received any payments from the company and that she would never work with Ironcat again. She also stated that Bennett &quot;has no right to say this about his former employee. If they really wish to talk to me, my e-mail address is very easy to find because there were links from their former web page to mine.&quot;

==Attempted comeback==
In late 2004, Ironcat signed artist Isabel Marks, licensing her webcomic &quot;Namir Deiter&quot;. For the launch, Ironcat created a third imprint, Fuzzy Kitten, as part of a planned imprint for furry-oriented comics. However, only one volume of &quot;Namir Deiter&quot; was released under this banner.

&quot;Namir Deiter&quot; came too late to help Ironcat. Deep in debt and unable to obtain additional capital, Ironcat was forced to cease printing its current properties and to decline options to license promising manga titles.

On January 28, 2005, Studio Ironcat closed operations and made a statement regarding this matter on their website. From that point, the Studio Ironcat website remained open with orders still being taken for present stock, but the site served as a clearing house for the remainder of Ironcat&#x27;s published stock. On January 12, 2006, a notice was placed on the front page that the catalog was being sent to a liquidator for final dissolution of remaining stock. The site is now closed.

<text>Frederick M. Gallagher III (born November 15, 1968) is an American illustrator and web cartoonist. He is best known as the artist, co-creator, and now full owner of &quot;Megatokyo&quot;. He also goes by the name of Piro, the main character of &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, who he has stated is an idealized version of himself when he was in college. He took this name from that of the cat in the visual novel &quot;Kanon&quot;.
Gallagher lives with his wife and their son in Saline, Michigan.

==Projects==

===&quot;The Fine Red Cat&quot;===
&quot;The Fine Red Cat&quot; (1993) is a children&#x27;s book by Jennifer Ann Gallagher, Fred Gallagher&#x27;s sister. It is notable as the first published work Gallagher illustrated.

===&quot;Megatokyo&quot;===
The webcomic &quot;Megatokyo&quot; started its run on August 14, 2000 in collaboration with Rodney Caston, who owned the domain and wrote many of the scripts for the first year and a half, while Gallagher was responsible for the artwork. Due to creative differences, Caston agreed to sell his share in the venture to Gallagher in May 2002.

&quot;Megatokyo&quot;&#x27;s success has allowed Gallagher to pursue it as a full-time occupation starting in October 2002, after being laid off from his job as an architect. He took a part-time job in 2018-present, as life events had prevented regular updates and revenue dropped off accordingly. &quot;Megatokyo&quot; in its entirety is available free of charge at the &quot;Megatokyo&quot; website, with strips being paired with comments from Gallagher. Gallagher&#x27;s income from the strip comes from advertising, sales of &quot;Megatokyo&quot; books and merchandise, Patreon, and Twitch. 

Since Gallagher attained full control over the strip, it has become more reflective of his vision, with an increasingly complex cast of characters, and a far slower pace than the original strips. The influence of Japanese manga and computer dating sims can be seen in both the character design, plotline and storytelling. While this has earned praise from some critics, it has also alienated some fans of the earlier strips, which were more comical, relying more on humor, slapstick, gags, and simpler storylines.

===&quot;Fredart&quot;===
&quot;Fredart&quot; is a collection of Gallagher&#x27;s works dating back several years. It includes development sketches from other projects, such as &quot;Warmth&quot;. Since &quot;Megatokyo&quot; began, most of the content has been focused on characters from that project.

&quot;Fredart Studios LLC&quot; is the name of the company that officially owns the trademark to &quot;Megatokyo&quot; and Fred&#x27;s other works. Megagear Inc. is the company owned and operated by Fred and his wife Sarah that runs the &quot;MegaGear&quot; store which sells &quot;Megatokyo&quot; related merchandise.

===&quot;envelop(e)&quot;===
A doujinshi work of Gallagher&#x27;s from 1999. As he describes it:

:Using the format of an illustrated story, &#x27;envelop(e)&#x27; tells the story of how a misplaced envelope and love letter causes confusion between childhood friends who never really understood how much they meant to each other before.

===&quot;Warmth&quot;===
&quot;Warmth&quot; is a more serious love story on which Gallagher was working before &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, but it was pushed into the background when &quot;Megatokyo&quot; became popular. A few chapters of &quot;Warmth&quot; were released in the early issues of I.C. Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;AmeriManga&quot; magazine. Gallagher has stated a number of times that he has not given up on the property, and will continue it in the future. Gallagher had released a sample (but this was later deleted), and many other drawings that include characters who will be featured in &quot;Warmth&quot;.

The main characters of &quot;Warmth&quot; are called Tom Moore, Tobari Saeko, and Shizuhara Eimi. Both Saeko and Eimi have cameos in recent Megatokyo strips.

===Blurred===
Blurred was a semi-erotic experimental art website, created by Gallagher in 1998 using the pen name &quot;blurri.&quot; Gallagher later took it offline for personal reasons, but a discussion on February 2, 2006 on 4chan started a coordinated attempt to discover the contents of this website. On June 8, 2006, Gallagher again allowed public access to the &quot;blurred&quot; site, and mentioned it in his newspost on &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, in order to end the controversy.

===Title TBA===
Fred Gallagher announced that, some time in 2007, megagear (the Megatokyo store) would release a mini doujinshi. Little to nothing was known about this project, but it was expected later in the year.
&quot;&quot;We are looking forward to a great 2007. Megatokyo Volume 5 will be released in the Spring and we have lots of other new items planned including a skateboard deck, the first Megatokyo calendar, clocks, and a mini doujinshi for later in the year. &quot;

It is possible that this is an endgames doujinshi.
&quot;But maybe 2 regularly delivered comics with everything else you expect from these websites - rants, updates, etc - including some other projects like maybe &#x27;warmth&#x27; getting off the ground (and that endgames doujin i want to do)... we&#x27;ll see.&quot;&quot;

In 2009, he posted an endgames preview and called it a doujin.

In May 2011, it was announced that Endgames were being revamped in a light novel format, with a story written by webfiction author Thomas Knapp, with four light novels planned. A short story &quot;Behind the Masque&quot; was also announced, and released on Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Store on June 10, 2011.

==Convention appearances==
Anime conventions in the United States Gallagher has appeared at include Otakon in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005, as well as A-Kon, Sakura-Con, Comic-Con International, and Anime Central. International convention appearances include Anime Expo Tokyo in 2004 and Ayacon in Northampton, UK in 2003.

<doc id="243800" wikidata="Q1339231" url="?curid=243800" title="Coroutine">
<text>Coroutines are computer program components that allow execution to be suspended and resumed, generalizing subroutines for cooperative multitasking. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.

They have been described as &quot;functions whose execution you can pause&quot;.

Melvin Conway coined the term &quot;coroutine&quot; in 1958 when he applied it to the construction of an assembly program. The first published explanation of the coroutine appeared later, in 1963.

== Definition and types ==
There is no single precise definition of coroutine. In 1980 Christopher D. Marlin summarized two widely-acknowledged fundamental characteristics of a coroutine: 

# the values of data local to a coroutine persist between successive calls;
# the execution of a coroutine is suspended as control leaves it, only to carry on where it left off when control re-enters the coroutine at some later stage.

Besides that, a coroutine implementation has 3 features:

# the control-transfer mechanism. &quot;Asymmetric coroutines&quot; usually provide keywords like codice_1 and codice_2. Programmers cannot freely choose which frame to yield to. The runtime only yields to the nearest caller of the current coroutine. On the other hand, in &quot;symmetric coroutines&quot;, programmers must specify a yield destination.
# whether coroutines are provided in the language as first-class objects, which can be freely manipulated by the programmer, or as constrained constructs;
# whether a coroutine is able to suspend its execution from within nested function calls. Such a coroutine is a &quot;stackful coroutine&quot;. One to the contrary is called &quot;stackless coroutines&quot;, where unless marked as coroutine, a regular function can&#x27;t use the keyword codice_1. 

The paper &quot;Revisiting Coroutines&quot; published in 2009 proposed term &quot;full coroutine&quot; to denote one that supports first-class coroutine and is stackful. Full Coroutines deserve their own name in that they have the same expressive power as one-shot continuations and delimited continuations. Full coroutines are either symmetric or asymmetric. Importantly, whether a coroutine is symmetric or asymmetric has no bearing on how expressive it can be as they are equally as expressive, though full coroutines are more expressive than non-full coroutines. While their expressive power is the same, asymmetrical coroutines more closely resemble routine based control structures in the sense that control is always passed back to the invoker, which programmers may find more familiar.

==Comparison with==
===Subroutines===
Subroutines are special cases of coroutines. When subroutines are invoked, execution begins at the start, and once a subroutine exits, it is finished; an instance of a subroutine only returns once, and does not hold state between invocations. By contrast, coroutines can exit by calling other coroutines, which may later return to the point where they were invoked in the original coroutine; from the coroutine&#x27;s point of view, it is not exiting but calling another coroutine. Thus, a coroutine instance holds state, and varies between invocations; there can be multiple instances of a given coroutine at once. The difference between calling another coroutine by means of &quot;yielding&quot; to it and simply calling another routine (which then, also, would return to the original point), is that the relationship between two coroutines which yield to each other is not that of caller-callee, but instead symmetric.

Any subroutine can be translated to a coroutine which does not call &quot;yield&quot;.

Here is a simple example of how coroutines can be useful. Suppose you have a consumer-producer relationship where one routine creates items and adds them to a queue and another removes items from the queue and uses them. For reasons of efficiency, you want to add and remove several items at once. The code might look like this:

 &quot;var&quot; q := new queue
 coroutine produce
 loop
 while q is not full
 create some new items
 add the items to q
 yield to consume
 coroutine consume
 loop
 while q is not empty
 remove some items from q
 use the items
 yield to produce
 call produce

The queue is then completely filled or emptied before yielding control to the other coroutine using the &quot;yield&quot; command. The further coroutines calls are starting right after the &quot;yield&quot;, in the outer coroutine loop.

Although this example is often used as an introduction to multithreading, two threads are not needed for this: the &quot;yield&quot; statement can be implemented by a jump directly from one routine into the other.

===Threads===
Coroutines are very similar to threads. However, coroutines are cooperatively multitasked, whereas threads are typically preemptively multitasked. Coroutines provide concurrency, because they allow tasks to be performed out of order or in a changeable order, without changing the overall outcome, but they do not provide parallelism, because they do not execute multiple tasks simultaneously. The advantages of coroutines over threads are that they may be used in a hard-realtime context (switching between coroutines need not involve any system calls or any blocking calls whatsoever), there is no need for synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, etc. in order to guard critical sections, and there is no need for support from the operating system.

It is possible to implement coroutines using preemptively-scheduled threads, in a way that will be transparent to the calling code, but some of the advantages (particularly the suitability for hard-realtime operation and relative cheapness of switching between them) will be lost.

===Generators===

Generators, also known as semicoroutines, are a subset of coroutines. Specifically, while both can yield multiple times, suspending their execution and allowing re-entry at multiple entry points, they differ in coroutines&#x27; ability to control where execution continues immediately after they yield, while generators cannot, instead transferring control back to the generator&#x27;s caller. That is, since generators are primarily used to simplify the writing of iterators, the codice_1 statement in a generator does not specify a coroutine to jump to, but rather passes a value back to a parent routine.

However, it is still possible to implement coroutines on top of a generator facility, with the aid of a top-level dispatcher routine (a trampoline, essentially) that passes control explicitly to child generators identified by tokens passed back from the generators:

 &quot;var&quot; q := new queue
 generator produce
 loop
 while q is not full
 create some new items
 add the items to q
 yield
 generator consume
 loop
 while q is not empty
 remove some items from q
 use the items
 yield
 subroutine dispatcher
 &quot;var&quot; d := new dictionary(generator → iterator)
 d[produce] := start consume
 d[consume] := start produce
 &quot;var&quot; current := produce
 loop
 call current
 current := next d[current]
 call dispatcher

A number of implementations of coroutines for languages with generator support but no native coroutines (e.g. Python before 2.5) use this or a similar model.

===Mutual recursion===

Using coroutines for state machines or concurrency is similar to using mutual recursion with tail calls, as in both cases the control changes to a different one of a set of routines. However, coroutines are more flexible and generally more efficient. Since coroutines yield rather than return, and then resume execution rather than restarting from the beginning, they are able to hold state, both variables (as in a closure) and execution point, and yields are not limited to being in tail position; mutually recursive subroutines must either use shared variables or pass state as parameters. Further, each mutually recursive call of a subroutine requires a new stack frame (unless tail call elimination is implemented), while passing control between coroutines uses the existing contexts and can be implemented simply by a jump.

==Common uses==
Coroutines are useful to implement the following:

* State machines within a single subroutine, where the state is determined by the current entry/exit point of the procedure; this can result in more readable code compared to use of goto, and may also be implemented via mutual recursion with tail calls.
* Actor model of concurrency, for instance in video games. Each actor has its own procedures (this again logically separates the code), but they voluntarily give up control to central scheduler, which executes them sequentially (this is a form of cooperative multitasking).
* Generators, and these are useful for streamsparticularly input/outputand for generic traversal of data structures.
* Communicating sequential processes where each sub-process is a coroutine. Channel inputs/outputs and blocking operations yield coroutines and a scheduler unblocks them on completion events. Alternatively, each sub-process may be the parent of the one following it in the data pipeline (or preceding it, in which case the pattern can be expressed as nested generators).
* Reverse communication, commonly used in mathematical software, wherein a procedure such as a solver, integral evaluator, ... needs the using process to make a computation, such as evaluating an equation or integrand.

==Native support==

Coroutines originated as an assembly language method, but are supported in some high-level programming languages.

Since continuations can be used to implement coroutines, programming languages that support them can also quite easily support coroutines.

==Implementations==
, many of the most popular programming languages, including C and its derivatives, do not have built-in support for coroutines within the language or their standard libraries. This is, in large part, due to the limitations of stack-based subroutine implementation. An exception is the C++ library Boost.Context, part of boost libraries, which supports context swapping on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC and x86 on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows. Coroutines can be built upon Boost.Context.

In situations where a coroutine would be the natural implementation of a mechanism, but is not available, the typical response is to use a closurea subroutine with state variables (static variables, often boolean flags) to maintain an internal state between calls, and to transfer control to the correct point. Conditionals within the code result in the execution of different code paths on successive calls, based on the values of the state variables. Another typical response is to implement an explicit state machine in the form of a large and complex switch statement or via a goto statement, particularly a computed goto. Such implementations are considered difficult to understand and maintain, and a motivation for coroutine support.

Threads, and to a lesser extent fibers, are an alternative to coroutines in mainstream programming environments today. Threads provide facilities for managing the real-time cooperative interaction of &quot;simultaneously&quot; executing pieces of code. Threads are widely available in environments that support C (and are supported natively in many other modern languages), are familiar to many programmers, and are usually well-implemented, well-documented and well-supported. However, as they solve a large and difficult problem they include many powerful and complex facilities and have a correspondingly difficult learning curve. As such, when a coroutine is all that is needed, using a thread can be overkill.

One important difference between threads and coroutines is that threads are typically preemptively scheduled while coroutines are not. Because threads can be rescheduled at any instant and can execute concurrently, programs using threads must be careful about locking. In contrast, because coroutines can only be rescheduled at specific points in the program and do not execute concurrently, programs using coroutines can often avoid locking entirely. This property is also cited as a benefit of event-driven or asynchronous programming.

Since fibers are cooperatively scheduled, they provide an ideal base for implementing coroutines above. However, system support for fibers is often lacking compared to that for threads.

===C===
In order to implement general-purpose coroutines, a second call stack must be obtained, which is a feature not directly supported by the C language. A reliable (albeit platform-specific) way to achieve this is to use a small amount of inline assembly to explicitly manipulate the stack pointer during initial creation of the coroutine. This is the approach recommended by Tom Duff in a discussion on its relative merits vs. the method used by Protothreads. On platforms which provide the POSIX sigaltstack system call, a second call stack can be obtained by calling a springboard function from within a signal handler to achieve the same goal in portable C, at the cost of some extra complexity. C libraries complying to POSIX or the Single Unix Specification (SUSv3) provided such routines as getcontext, setcontext, makecontext and swapcontext, but these functions were declared obsolete in POSIX 1.2008.

Once a second call stack has been obtained with one of the methods listed above, the setjmp and longjmp functions in the standard C library can then be used to implement the switches between coroutines. These functions save and restore, respectively, the stack pointer, program counter, callee-saved registers, and any other internal state as required by the ABI, such that returning to a coroutine after having yielded restores all the state that would be restored upon returning from a function call. Minimalist implementations, which do not piggyback off the setjmp and longjmp functions, may achieve the same result via a small block of inline assembly which swaps merely the stack pointer and program counter, and clobbers all other registers. This can be significantly faster, as setjmp and longjmp must conservatively store all registers which may be in use according to the ABI, whereas the clobber method allows the compiler to store (by spilling to the stack) only what it knows is actually in use.

Due to the lack of direct language support, many authors have written their own libraries for coroutines which hide the above details. Russ Cox&#x27;s libtask library is a good example of this genre. It uses the context functions if they are provided by the native C library; otherwise it provides its own implementations for ARM, PowerPC, Sparc, and x86. Other notable implementations include libpcl, coro, lthread, libCoroutine, libconcurrency, libcoro, ribs2, libdill., libaco, and libco.

In addition to the general approach above, several attempts have been made to approximate coroutines in C with combinations of subroutines and macros. Simon Tatham&#x27;s contribution, based on Duff&#x27;s device, is a notable example of the genre, and is the basis for Protothreads and similar implementations. In addition to Duff&#x27;s objections, Tatham&#x27;s own comments provide a frank evaluation of the limitations of this approach: &quot;As far as I know, this is the worst piece of C hackery ever seen in serious production code.&quot; The main shortcomings of this approximation are that, in not maintaining a separate stack frame for each coroutine, local variables are not preserved across yields from the function, it is not possible to have multiple entries to the function, and control can only be yielded from the top-level routine.

===C++===
* C++20 introduced standardized coroutines as stackless functions that can be suspended in the middle of execution and resumed at a later point. The suspended state of a coroutine is stored on the heap. Implementation of this standard is ongoing, with the G++ and MSVC compilers currently fully supporting standard coroutines in recent versions.
* concurrencpp - a C++20 library which provides third-party support for C++20 coroutines, in the form of awaitable-tasks and executors that run them. 
*Boost.Coroutine - created by Oliver Kowalke, is the official released portable coroutine library of boost since version 1.53. The library relies on Boost.Context and supports ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC and X86 on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows.
*Boost.Coroutine2 - also created by Oliver Kowalke, is a modernized portable coroutine library since boost version 1.59. It takes advantage of C++11 features, but removes the support for symmetric coroutines.
*Mordor - In 2010, Mozy open sourced a C++ library implementing coroutines, with an emphasis on using them to abstract asynchronous I/O into a more familiar sequential model.
*CO2 - stackless coroutine based on C++ preprocessor tricks, providing await/yield emulation.
*ScummVM - The ScummVM project implements a light-weight version of stackless coroutines based on Simon Tatham&#x27;s article.

* Coroutines landed in Clang in May 2017, with libc++ implementation ongoing.
* elle by Docker
* oatpp-coroutines - stackless coroutines with scheduling designed for high-concurrency level I/O operations. Used in the 5-million WebSocket connections experiment by Oat++. Part of the Oat++ web framework.

===C#===
C# 2.0 added semi-coroutine (generator) functionality through the iterator pattern and codice_1 keyword. C# 5.0 includes await syntax support. In addition:

*The MindTouch Dream REST framework provides an implementation of coroutines based on the C# 2.0 iterator pattern.
* The Caliburn () screen patterns framework for WPF uses C# 2.0 iterators to ease UI programming, particularly in asynchronous scenarios.
*The Power Threading Library () by Jeffrey Richter implements an AsyncEnumerator that provides simplified Asynchronous Programming Model using iterator-based coroutines.
*The Unity game engine implements coroutines.
*The Servelat Pieces project by Yevhen Bobrov provides transparent asynchrony for Silverlight WCF services and ability to asynchronously call any synchronous method. The implementation is based on Caliburn&#x27;s Coroutines iterator and C# iterator blocks.
*StreamThreads is an open-source, light-weight C# co-routine library based on iterator extension methods. It supports error handling and return values.

===Clojure===
Cloroutine is a third-party library providing support for stackless coroutines in Clojure. It&#x27;s implemented as a macro, statically splitting an arbitrary code block on arbitrary var calls and emitting the coroutine as a stateful function.

===D===
D implements coroutines as its standard library class Fiber A &quot;generator&quot; makes it trivial to expose a fiber function as an &quot;input range&quot;, making any fiber compatible with existing range algorithms.

===Go===
Go has a built-in concept of &quot;goroutines&quot;, which are lightweight, independent processes managed by the Go runtime. A new goroutine can be started using the &quot;go&quot; keyword. Each goroutine has a variable-size stack which can be expanded as needed. Goroutines generally communicate using Go&#x27;s built-in channels. However, goroutines are not coroutines (for instance, local data does not persist between successive calls).

===Java===
There are several implementations for coroutines in Java. Despite the constraints imposed by Java&#x27;s abstractions, the JVM does not preclude the possibility. There are four general methods used, but two break bytecode portability among standards-compliant JVMs.

* Modified JVMs. It is possible to build a patched JVM to support coroutines more natively. The Da Vinci JVM has had patches created.
* Modified bytecode. Coroutine functionality is possible by rewriting regular Java bytecode, either on the fly or at compile time. Toolkits include Javaflow, Java Coroutines, and Coroutines.
* Platform-specific JNI mechanisms. These use JNI methods implemented in the OS or C libraries to provide the functionality to the JVM.
* Thread abstractions. Coroutine libraries which are implemented using threads may be heavyweight, though performance will vary based on the JVM&#x27;s thread implementation.

=== JavaScript ===
Since ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript has support for generators, which are a special case of coroutines.

=== Kotlin ===
Kotlin implements coroutines as part of a first-party library.

=== Lua ===

Lua has supported first-class stackful asymmetric coroutines since version 5.0 (2003), in the standard library &quot;coroutine&quot;.

=== Modula-2 ===
Modula-2 as defined by Wirth implements coroutines as part of the standard SYSTEM library.

The procedure NEWPROCESS() fills in a context given a code block and space for a stack as parameters, and the procedure TRANSFER() transfers control to a coroutine given the coroutine&#x27;s context as its parameter.

===Mono===
The Mono Common Language Runtime has support for continuations, from which coroutines can be built.

===.NET Framework===
During the development of the .NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft extended the design of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) hosting APIs to handle fiber-based scheduling with an eye towards its use in fiber-mode for SQL server. Before release, support for the task switching hook ICLRTask::SwitchOut was removed due to time constraints. Consequently, the use of the fiber API to switch tasks is currently not a viable option in the .NET Framework.

===OCaml===
OCaml supports coroutines through its codice_6 module. These coroutines provide concurrency without parallelism, and are scheduled preemptively on a single operating system thread. Since OCaml 5.0, green threads are also available; provided by different modules.

===Perl===
* Coro

Coroutines are natively implemented in all Raku backends.

===PHP===
* Fibers native since PHP 8.1
* Amphp
* Open Swoole
*Coroutine implemented in a way that resembles Python functions, and some Go, many examples showing there code converted with same number of lines and behavior.

===Python===
*Python 2.5 implements better support for coroutine-like functionality, based on extended generators (PEP 342)
*Python 3.3 improves this ability, by supporting delegating to a subgenerator (PEP 380)
*Python 3.4 introduces a comprehensive asynchronous I/O framework as standardized in PEP 3156, which includes coroutines that leverage subgenerator delegation 
*Python 3.5 introduces explicit support for coroutines with async/await syntax (PEP 0492).
*Since Python 3.7, async/await have become reserved keywords.
*Eventlet
*Greenlet
*gevent
*stackless python

===Racket===
Racket provides native continuations, with a trivial implementation of coroutines provided in the official package catalog. Implementation by S. De Gabrielle

===Ruby===
* Ruby 1.9 supports coroutines natively which are implemented as fibers, which are semi-coroutines.
* An implementation by Marc De Scheemaecker
* Ruby 2.5 and higher supports coroutines natively which are implemented as fibers
* An implementation by Thomas W Branson

===Scheme===
Since Scheme provides full support for continuations, implementing coroutines is nearly trivial, requiring only that a queue of continuations be maintained.

===Smalltalk===
Since, in most Smalltalk environments, the execution stack is a first-class citizen, coroutines can be implemented without additional library or VM support.

===Tool Command Language (Tcl)===
Since version 8.6, the Tool Command Language supports coroutines in the core language.
===Vala===
Vala implements native support for coroutines. They are designed to be used with a Gtk Main Loop, but can be used alone if care is taken to ensure that the end callback will never have to be called before doing, at least, one yield.

===Assembly languages===
Machine-dependent assembly languages often provide direct methods for coroutine execution. For example, in MACRO-11, the assembly language of the PDP-11 family of minicomputers, the &quot;classic&quot; coroutine switch is effected by the instruction &quot;JSR PC,@(SP)+&quot;, which jumps to the address popped from the stack and pushes the current (&quot;i.e&quot; that of the next) instruction address onto the stack. On VAXen (in VAX MACRO) the comparable instruction is &quot;JSB @(SP)+&quot;. Even on a Motorola 6809 there is the instruction &quot;JSR [,S++]&quot;; note the &quot;++&quot;, as 2 bytes (of address) are popped from the stack. This instruction is much used in the (standard) &#x27;monitor&#x27; Assist 09.

<text>Dorothy, Lady Dunnett (née Halliday, 25 August 1923 – 9 November 2001) was a Scottish novelist best known for her historical fiction. Dunnett is most famous for her six novel series set during the 16th century, which concern the fictitious adventurer Francis Crawford of Lymond. This was followed by the eight novel prequel series &quot;The House of Niccolò&quot;. Her other works include a novel concerning the historical Macbeth called &quot;King Hereafter&quot; (1982), and a series of mystery novels centered upon Johnson Johnson, a portrait painter and spy.

==Life and work==
Dunnett was educated at James Gillespie&#x27;s High School for Girls in Edinburgh. She started her career as a press officer in the civil service, where she met her husband.

A leading light in the Scottish arts world and a renaissance woman, she was a professional portrait painter and exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy on many occasions. She had portraits commissioned by a number of prominent public figures in Scotland. She had a keen interest in opera, was a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, a board member of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, a trustee of the Scottish National War Memorial, and a non-executive director of Scottish Television. In 1992 she was awarded an OBE for her services to literature. Writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Alexander Fiske-Harrison reviewed her final novel in 2000, &quot;Gemini&quot;, and through that her entire oeuvre of historical fiction: &quot;Although Dunnett’s writing style is not the neutral prose of genre fiction and it can be opaque and hard to read, especially in the early works, at times, this works with the almost melodramatic content to produce a powerful, operatic mixture... It is neither as a literary novelist nor as a historian, but as a writer of historical fiction that Dorothy Dunnett deserves recognition... The publication of &quot;Gemini&quot; completes an ambitious literary circle.&quot;

In 2001 she founded the Dorothy Dunnett Society to promote interest in the historical periods about which she wrote and communication among her readers. Dunnett&#x27;s archive was left to the National Library of Scotland and articles from it appear in &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot;, the magazine of the Dorothy Dunnett Society.

Dorothy Dunnett was married in 1946 to Sir Alastair Dunnett, editor of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper, and appears in his autobiography, &quot;Among Friends&quot;, 1984. By virtue of his knighthood in 1995, she became Lady Dunnett. She died in Edinburgh, and was survived by her sons Ninian and Mungo Dunnett.

==Historical fiction==

===&quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;===
The manuscript for the first book in the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;, &quot;The Game of Kings&quot;, was rejected by five British publishers before being published by U.S. publisher Putnam in 1961. It was written in response to her husband&#x27;s suggestion that she write something herself, when she complained of having run out of reading material.

The &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot; is a series of six novels, set in mid-sixteenth-century Europe and the Mediterranean, which follows the life and career of a Scottish nobleman, Francis Crawford of Lymond, from 1547 through 1558. Meticulously researched, the series takes place in a wide variety of locations, including France, the Ottoman Empire, Malta, England, Scotland and Russia. In addition to a compelling cast of original characters, the novels feature many historical figures, often in important roles.

===&quot;The House of Niccolò&quot;===
&quot;The House of Niccolò&quot; is a series of eight historical novels set in the late-fifteenth-century European Renaissance. &quot;Niccolo Rising&quot;, the first book of the series, was published in 1986, and the last, &quot;Gemini&quot; in 2000. The protagonist of the series is Nicholas de Fleury (Niccolò, Nicholas van der Poele, or Claes), a talented boy of uncertain birth who rises to the heights of European merchant banking and international political intrigue. The series shares most of the locations in Dunnett&#x27;s earlier series, the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;, but it extends much further geographically to take in the important urban centres of Bruges, Venice, Florence, Geneva, and the Hanseatic League; Burgundy, Flanders, and Poland; Iceland; the Iberian Peninsula and Madeira; the Black Sea cities of Trebizond and Caffa; Persia; the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Rhodes; Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula; and West Africa and the city of Timbuktu. Nicholas&#x27;s progress is intertwined with such historical characters as Anselm Adornes, James III of Scotland and James II of Cyprus.

As with the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;, the series features a number of historical persons, many as important characters. Both the historical and fictional characters are, however, taken from a wider variety of occupations and social classes than in the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;. There are significant differences in narrative approach and writing style between the series, reflecting in part the very different personal journey taken by the central character in each.

===&quot;King Hereafter&quot;===
&quot;King Hereafter&quot; (1982), her long novel set in Orkney and Scotland in the years just before the invasion of England by William the Conqueror, was in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s eyes her masterpiece. It is about an Earl of Orkney uniting the people of Alba (Scotland) and becoming its king, and is based on the author&#x27;s premise that the central character Thorfinn, Earl of Orkney and the historical Macbeth, Scottish King, were one and the same person (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name).

===&quot;The Dorothy Dunnett Companion&quot; and &quot;Companion II&quot;===
Dunnett assisted in the compilation of &quot;The Dorothy Dunnett Companion&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Dorothy Dunnett Companion II&quot; (2002), which were written by Elspeth Morrison. These books provide background information to historical characters and events featured in the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The House of Niccolò&quot;, as well as explanations of classical allusions and literary and other quotations used in the two series, notes to sources of these citations, and many maps. The second volume, which was written after the Niccolò series was completed, contains a bibliography of many of the hundreds of primary and secondary sources Dunnett used in her historical research. Dunnett contributed more to the second volume than the first and wrote many of the entries.

==The Johnson Johnson series==

This series of mystery thrillers was written over a long period, starting when she was writing the Lymond Chronicles. The final entry was published prior to the first House of Niccolò book.

==Other works==
===&quot;The Proving Climb&quot;===
A contemporary short story, &quot;The Proving Climb&quot;, set on the Scottish Isle of St. Kilda, was published in the 1973 anthology &quot;Scottish Short Stories&quot; (Scottish Arts Council, published by Collins, ). It was republished by the Dorothy Dunnett Society and distributed to its members in 2008 with issue 100 of &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot;.

===&quot;The Lymond Poetry&quot;===
&quot;The Lymond Poetry&quot; contains her versions and translations of some of the poems that appeared in &quot;The Lymond Chronicles&quot;. This was finalised after her death by Elspeth Morrison and edited by Richenda Todd ( published in 2003 by Penguin).

===&quot;The Scottish Highlands&quot;===
In collaboration with her husband, Alastair Dunnett, she wrote the text for the photography book &quot;The Scottish Highlands&quot; (Photographs: David Patterson), published in 1988.

==Adaptations==
In December 2016, it was announced that the rights to the &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot; had been obtained by Mammoth Screen with a view to making a TV series.

==Additional information==

===Dorothy Dunnett Society===
Dorothy Dunnett founded the Dorothy Dunnett Society. Membership of this registered charity is open to all Dunnett readers, and aims to promote interest in the periods of history about which Dunnett wrote, to preserve her writings, and to promote appreciation of the literary merit of her works. It also encourages discussion and meetings between readers. Prior to 1 September 2011, the Society was known as the Dorothy Dunnett Readers&#x27; Association.

===Memorial===
On 22 April 2006, a memorial stone to Lady Dunnett was laid by her grandchildren, Hal and Bella Dunnett, alongside those for Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott in the Makars&#x27; Court in Lady Stair&#x27;s Close on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Lord Provost of Edinburgh was in attendance, and gave a speech, as did the Edinburgh Makar (Valerie Gillies), and the Ross Herald (Charles Burnett). The initiative to lay the stone, and the main funding for it, came from the members of the Dorothy Dunnett Society. The Stone contains Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s name, her coat of arms, and a brief quote from one of her books &quot;Where are the links of the chain ... joining us to the past&quot;.

===Edinburgh home===
Dunnett&#x27;s long-term home at 87 Colinton Road, Edinburgh was at an Edwardian era semi-detached villa in the Merchiston area, designed by Edward Calvert.

===Gatherings===
Dorothy Dunnett readers are devoted and active, and have held gatherings in Edinburgh in 1990, 1994, and in 2000 with over 300 people in attendance. Similar events were held in Boston, and in Philadelphia in 2000. Since her death smaller international gatherings of between 50 and 115 people have been held in Dublin (November 2001), New Orleans (November 2003), Malta (October 2005), Saddell in South West Scotland (April 2007), Orkney (September 2007), and Paris (2010).
A gathering, &#x27;The Dunnett Siege of Constantinople&#x27;, took place in Istanbul in September 2012. Places visited by the 115 Siegers focused on &quot;Pawn in Frankincense&quot; and also on John Grant in the Niccolὸ series, in which historical character John Grant had taken part in the 1453 Siege of Constantinople, this was followed by the &#x27;Dunnett Carnival of Venice&#x27; in Venice in 2016 focusing primarily on the &#x27;House of Niccolò&#x27;.

There are several meetings of readers in the UK each year, in locations such as Oxford, Bath, London, York, Warwick, Harrogate and Stamford. Also the formal Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Dorothy Dunnett Society is held each spring in Edinburgh as part of its Dorothy Dunnett Weekend.

Occasional meetings are held in Australia and Canada, as well, with one &quot;SworDDplay&quot; held in Vancouver in April 2006 and another in Alexandria, Virginia in the United States in March 2008 and the Dunnett Confluence of Pittsburgh took place in Pennsylvania in October 2013. Smaller meetings also occur locally in several other countries, such as Germany (notably the annual meeting in Darmstadt) and Italy.

Readers also get together more informally to go on holiday to various Dunnett locations. In 2007 some readers visited Timbuktu and others Venice.

===International Dorothy Dunnett Day (IDDD)===
In 2011, the first International Dorothy Dunnett Day was announced by the Dorothy Dunnett Society to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Game of Kings&quot;. It was held on Saturday 15 October 2011, with readers gathering in locations around the world at 13:00 (1pm) local time to toast the author. Meetings were held in Edinburgh, London, Vancouver, San Francisco, the Costa Del Sol, Boston, and other locations. The second IDDD was held on Saturday 10 November 2012, to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the death of Dorothy Dunnett on 9 November 2001. The last pre-COVID-19 event was held on 9 November 2019.

Crossing the Chasm is an adaptation of an innovation-adoption model called diffusion of innovations theory created by Everett Rogers, The author argues there is a chasm between the early adopters of the product (the technology enthusiasts and visionaries) and the early majority (the pragmatists). Moore believes visionaries and pragmatists have very different expectations, and he attempts to explore those differences and suggest techniques to successfully cross the &quot;chasm,&quot; including choosing a target market, understanding the whole product concept, positioning the product, building a marketing strategy, choosing the most appropriate distribution channel and pricing.

According to Moore, anyone with an innovation or new product should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. If a successful firm can create a bandwagon effect in which enough momentum builds, then the product becomes a de facto standard, by creating a complete solution for one intractable problem in one business vertical before building out services in adjacent verticals and expanding on from there.

==Foundational Criticism==
Everett Rogers, creator of diffusion of innovations which is the foundation of chasm theory, challenged the chasm concept saying &quot;Past research shows no support for this claim of a chasm between certain adopter categories. On the contrary, innovativeness, if measured properly, is a continuous variable and there are no sharp breaks or discontinuities between adjacent adopter categories (although there are important differences between them)&quot;

== Chasm concept formation==
A 4-year &quot;concept formation study&quot; conducted by the Diffusion Research Institute (DRI) and published in 2021, documents the origin of the chasm concept, beginning with its creation at Regis McKenna Inc. in the Pacific Northwest.

The DRI study concluded the fundamental theories in Crossing the Chasm, including the concept of a gap or chasm between the early adopters of a product and the mainstream early majority, were developed in the late 1980s by Lee James and Warren Schirtzinger, consulting professionals working at Regis McKenna, Inc.

== Legacy and reception ==
Moore and his publisher originally thought that the book would sell around 5,000 copies. By 2002, ten years after the first publication, more than 300,000 copies had been sold. Moore attributes this to word-of-mouth marketing, resonating initially with high-tech managers, then to engineers, venture capitalists and finally business schools.

In 2006, Tom Byers, director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, described it as &quot;still the bible for entrepreneurial marketing 15 years later&quot;. The book&#x27;s success has led to a series of follow-up books including &quot;Inside the Tornado&quot;, &quot;Living on the Fault Line&quot;, &quot;The Chasm Companion&quot; and a consulting company, The Chasm Group.

==Analysis and possible antecedents==

&quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; is closely related to the technology adoption lifecycle where five main segments are recognized: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. 

Moore&#x27;s theories are only applicable for novel or discontinuous innovations in a B2B marketplace; adoption of continuous innovations — ones that do not force a significant change of behavior by the customer — are still best described by the original technology adoption lifecycle.

== The pre-chasm concept==
The concept of the &quot;pre-chasm&quot; in technology entrepreneurship describes the phase prior to the &quot;chasm&quot; in &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot;; in pre-chasm thinking, the focus is on the specifics of marketing high-tech products during the early start-up period. The pre-chasm concept was suggested as an extension to Moore&#x27;s model, arguing that the phase prior to the &quot;chasm&quot; is left unintended and that it, driven by technology commoditization and lean startup principles, requires an ambidextrous approach to product development alongside marketing to achieve product-market fit.

<text>The Mojave River is an intermittent river in the eastern San Bernardino Mountains and the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Most of its flow is underground, while its surface channels remain dry most of the time, except for the headwaters and several bedrock gorges in the lower reaches.

==History==
A desert branch of the Serrano Native Americans called the &quot;Vanyume&quot; or &quot;Beñemé&quot;, as Father Garcés called them, lived beyond and along much of the length of the Mojave River, from east of Barstow to at least the Victorville region, and perhaps even farther upstream to the south, for up to 8,000 years in a series of villages, including the major village of Wá&#x27;peat.

The Mohave&#x27;s trail, later the European immigrants&#x27; Mojave Road, ran west from their villages on the Colorado River to Soda Lake, then paralleled the river from its mouth on the lake to the Cajon Pass. Native Americans used this trade route where water could easily be found en route to the coast. Garcés explored the length of the Mojave River in early 1776. He called the river Arroyo de los Mártires (&quot;river of the martyrs&quot;) on March 9, 1776 but later Spaniards called it Río de las Ánimas (&quot;spirit river or river of the (lost) souls&quot;). In 1826 Jedediah Smith was the first non-Native American to travel overland to California by following the Mojave Indian Trail. He called this the Inconstant River.

A pack horse and livestock trail, the Old Spanish Trail, was established by Antonio Armijo in 1829 between New Mexico and El Pueblo de Los Ángeles, joined the Mojave River at its mouth near what is now Soda Lake. It followed the river to where the trail reached the foot of the mountains at Summit Valley and turned westward to pass over Cajon Pass and descend into the coastal valleys of southern Alta California. In 1830, Wolfskill and Yount pioneered what became the Main Route of the Old Spanish Trail, which followed a different route than Armijo, farther south just west of the Colorado River and then followed Jedediah Smith&#x27;s path on the old Mohave Trail west to the Mojave River mouth at Soda Lake, to meet with Armijo&#x27;s route coming south from Salt Spring.

Sometime before 1844, a cutoff developed on the Old Spanish Trail that cut the distance traveled along the upper river by cutting across what is now Victor Valley, from the Cajon Pass to a crossing just below the Lower Narrows of the river. John C. Frémont intercepted this route to the river, riding east southeast from Lake Elizabeth, north of the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains on April 20, 1844.

Frémont named the river Mohahve after the Mohave people on April 23, 1844, although these people lived two mountain ranges away on the Colorado River. He had met six traveling Mohaves that day. Some early Mormon ranchers called it the Macaby River. Additionally another cutoff to the Old Spanish Trail had developed before 1844, where the trail forked northeastward from the Mojave River and Mohave Trail, east of what is now Yermo, California running over Alvord Mountain, to Bitter Spring, then through Red Pass, to join the Armijo route near Salt Spring in the Silurian Valley. The fork of the trails there on the Mojave River, later became known as Fork of the Road.

From 1847, Mormons pioneered the wagon road that became the Mormon Road from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, closely following the route of the Old Spanish Trail from Parowan, Utah. They followed the Mojave River from the Fork of the Road to the Lower Narrows and left the river for the Cajon Pass on the route Frémont had found. In 1849, Forty-niners late on the main trail to California used the Mormon Road as a winter alternative route to California, referring to it as the &quot;Southern Route&quot; of the California Trail. Later, emigrants to California followed the same route during the winter months. In 1855, the Mormon Road was improved, and the route changed in places, becoming a major commercial wagon route between Utah and southern California, ending Utah&#x27;s winter isolation until the railroads arrived there in 1869.

In 1859, as part of the Mohave War, the Mohave people&#x27;s trail was improved as the wagon route of the Mojave Road. It followed the Mojave River from where the Mormon Road turned north away from the river at Fork of the Road, near Daggett, to where historic Camp Cady was located. It then followed the river to Soda Lake, where the road turned eastward to Fort Mojave, and in 1862 following the gold and silver strikes on the Colorado River, to Hardyville and the mining districts near it, and its connection at the head of the toll road to Prescott and the mines in the interior of Arizona Territory.

From 1863 to 1864, the Mojave River valley was a refuge from the great drought in California in those years; cattle of some resourceful ranchers of southern California were preserved by its resources.

==Course==
The river&#x27;s source is in the San Bernardino Mountains, one of the Transverse Ranges, above Hesperia-San Bernardino. The West Fork of the Mojave flows into Silverwood Lake, formed by Cedar Springs Dam, which overflows in the Mojave River Forks Reserve area. On occasion, the lake releases water into the river. Downstream, Deep Creek meets the West Fork, forming the Mojave River mainstem immediately upstream of the Mojave Forks Dam, which provides flood control. Downstream of the dam, the Mojave River flows north and east, underground in most places, through Hesperia, Victorville, and Barstow.

Near its terminus, the Mojave River flows out onto a large inland delta called the Mojave River Wash at the western edge of Mojave National Preserve. During heavy flows, the river reaches Soda Lake near Baker at the north end of Wash, and has reached Silver Lake, even further north, in historic times. For example, during the unusually wet winter of 2004–2005, the Mojave River flowed on the surface to Silver Lake and filled both Soda and Silver Lakes to a depth of several feet. A shallow pass, around 30 feet in height, separates Silver Lake from the Silurian Valley that contains Salt Creek, a tributary of the Amargosa River and thus the Death Valley drainage basin.
The water in the river is mostly underground. The channel at the surface remains dry most of the time, but extreme flooding is possible. For example, during a heavy El Niño in the Mojave Desert, rains caused the Mojave River to overflow onto overpassing bridges on February 22, 1993, the most damaged being on Bear Valley Road, where Victorville and Apple Valley are separated. The water comes to the surface only in areas with impermeable rock, such as the upper and lower narrows near Victorville and in the Afton Canyon area northeast of Barstow.

==Afton Canyon Natural Area==

The Afton Canyon Natural Area is within Mojave Trails National Monument, and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. It is located northeast of Barstow along Interstate 15 between the Afton Road and Basin Road exits.

Afton Canyon is designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern to protect plant and wildlife habitat, and to preserve scenic values of the Mojave River&#x27;s riparian area within the canyon. The Rasor Off-Highway Vehicle Area boundary enforcement has begun to reverse the heavy off-road vehicles use and damage that occurred in the riverbed and canyon. Restoration projects are ongoing and have already brought the river&#x27;s &quot;proper functioning condition&quot; from a &quot;non-functioning&quot; to a &quot;functioning at risk&quot; status. The objectives of the ambitious restoration project are to control exotic plants, particularly the phreatophyte Saltcedar - Tamarix (primarily &quot;Tamarix ramosissima&quot; and &quot;Tamarix parviflora&quot;), and restoring critical desert California native plant community &quot;structural elements&quot; for a functioning flora and fauna habitat.

<doc id="243819" wikidata="Q574171" url="?curid=243819" title="Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers">
<text>Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers (c. 144025 June 1483), was an English nobleman, courtier, bibliophile and writer. He was the brother of Queen Elizabeth Woodville who married King Edward IV. He was one of the leading members of the Woodville family, which came to prominence during the reign of King Edward IV. After Edward&#x27;s death, he was arrested and then executed by the Duke of Gloucester (the future King Richard III) as part of a power struggle between Richard and the Woodvilles. His English translation of &quot;The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers&quot; is one of the first books printed in England.

== Origins ==
He was the eldest son to survive childhood of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, by his wife Jacquetta of Luxembourg. His sister was Elizabeth Woodville, who married King Edward IV and became queen.

== Career ==
Like his father, he was originally a Lancastrian, fighting on that side at the Battle of Towton, but later became a Yorkist. The Woodvilles became very influential at the royal court after his sister Elizabeth Woodville married Edward IV and became queen. Anthony was made a Knight of the Garter. He is known to have been a great tournament champion, and once fought a two-day &quot;duel&quot; with Antoine, bastard of Burgundy.

The supporters of Edward IV were defeated at the Battle of Edgcote, near Banbury, on 24 July 1469, and Richard Woodville and his second son John Woodville were taken prisoners at Chepstow. After a hasty and controversial trial, they were both beheaded at Gosford Green, Coventry on 12 August 1469 and Anthony succeeded his father in the earldom.

=== Career as Earl Rivers ===
He joined the king in his temporary exile in 1470, and returned with him the next year, where he was wounded at the Battle of Barnet. As a result of this battle, Edward IV regained the throne. Whilst in charge of the garrison at the Tower of London, Rivers defeated an attempt by a Lancastrian army (led by Thomas Neville) to capture the city during the Siege of London (1471).

In 1472, Edward IV sent Rivers and his younger brother Edward Woodville to Brittany at the head of 1,000 archers to help the Bretons fend off a threatened French invasion of the duchy. The French withdrew when faced with determined resistance.

In 1473, King Edward IV appointed Rivers Governor of the Prince of Wales&#x27; household and Rivers went with the prince to Ludlow Castle. He was also appointed High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for life. His duties included the administration of justice throughout the principality.

In 1476, the Republic of Venice declared Anthony heir to the Kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, but his death ended all plans.

== Death and succession ==
When the king died suddenly in 1483, Rivers was ordered by his sister to bring the Prince of Wales, now King Edward V, straight back to London under an armed guard. They were intercepted by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), who arrested the Earl, along with his nephew Sir Richard Grey, the young king&#x27;s half-brother. Rivers was imprisoned and then beheaded at Pontefract Castle in West Yorkshire on 25 June 1483 as part of the duke&#x27;s path towards kingship (as Richard III).

Anthony was succeeded by his brother Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers. The Scales lands inherited from his wife were bequeathed to his younger brother Edward Woodville, but King Richard III ignored Anthony&#x27;s wishes as Edward had joined Henry Tudor.

== Marriages ==
He married twice, without legitimate progeny, as follows:
*Firstly to Elizabeth de Scales, &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Scales (d. 1473), daughter and heiress of Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales, and widow of Henry Bourchier, younger son of Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex. Before succeeding to his father&#x27;s earldom, Anthony was summoned to Parliament, in right of his wife, as Baron Scales.
*Secondly he married Mary FitzLewis, daughter of Henry FitzLewis.

Edward IV was secretly negotiating for the marriage of Anthony to Margaret of Scotland, but the deaths of Edward and Anthony both in 1483 ended all plans.

=== Mistress and illegitimate progeny ===
By his mistress Gwenlina Stradling, a daughter of William Stradling of St Donat&#x27;s Castle in Glamorgan, Wales, he had one illegitimate daughter named Margaret, who married Sir Robert Poyntz (d. 1520) lord of the manor of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire, who built the &quot;Poyntz Chapel&quot; within the Gaunt&#x27;s Chapel in Bristol. The stone ceiling boss of the &quot;Poyntz Chapel&quot; displays in relief sculpture the arms of Poyntz (of 4 quarters) impaling the arms of Woodville (of 6 quarters, 3rd quarter Woodville), and the two wooden end-panels of his monumental coffin, decorated with the heraldry of Poyntz and Woodville, survive in the Gaunt&#x27;s Chapel in which he was buried. The Heraldic Visitation of Gloucestershire records that:
:&quot;A testimony of this match apereth by indenture of covenant of the mariag yett extant under the hand and seale of the said Erle, by letters written by the hand of the reverend ffather Morton, Cardinall, also by the armes of the Erle impaled w(i)th Poyntz on the top of a Chappell near Bristowe where they lye buried&quot;.

== Literary interests ==
Rivers had met the earliest English printer William Caxton when in exile in Bruges, and there in 1475–76 Caxton published &quot;Cordyale, or Four last thinges&quot;, Rivers&#x27; English translation from the French of Jean Miélot of &quot;Les quattres choses derrenieres&quot;, itself a translation of the &quot;Cordiale quattuor novissimorum&quot;. After both of them had returned to England, one of the first, if not the first, books printed in England was Rivers&#x27; translation from French of the &quot;Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers&quot;, printed by Caxton at Westminster in 1477. Lambeth Palace Library has a manuscript illustration showing Rivers presenting a copy of this book to Edward IV (illustrated top right).

<text>In linguistics, agglutination is a morphological process in which words are formed by stringing together morphemes (word parts), each of which corresponds to a single syntactic feature. Languages that use agglutination widely are called agglutinative languages. For example, in the agglutinative language of Turkish, the word (&quot;from your houses&quot;) consists of the morphemes &quot;ev-ler-i-n-iz-den&quot;. Agglutinative languages are often contrasted with isolating languages, in which words are monomorphemic, and fusional languages, in which words can be complex, but morphemes may correspond to multiple features.

==Examples of agglutinative languages==

Although agglutination is characteristic of certain language families, this does not mean that when several languages in a certain geographic area are all agglutinative they are necessarily related phylogenetically. In the past, this assumption led linguists to propose the so-called Ural–Altaic language family, which included the Uralic and Turkic languages, as well as Mongolian, Korean, and Japanese. Contemporary linguistics views this proposal as controversial, and some refer to this as a language convergence instead.

Another consideration when evaluating the above proposal is that some languages that developed from agglutinative proto-languages lost their agglutinative features. For example, contemporary Estonian has shifted towards the fusional type. (It has also lost other features typical of the Uralic families, such as vowel harmony.)

===Eurasia and Oceania===

Examples of agglutinative languages include the Uralic languages, such as Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. These have highly agglutinated expressions in daily usage, and most words are bisyllabic or longer. Grammatical information expressed by adpositions in Western Indo-European languages is typically found in suffixes.

Hungarian uses extensive agglutination in almost every part of it. The suffixes follow each other in special order based on the role of the suffix, and many can be heaped, one upon the other, resulting in words conveying complex meanings in compacted forms. An example is &quot;fiaiéi,&quot; where the root &quot;fi(ú)-&quot; means &quot;son&quot;, the subsequent four vowels are all separate suffixes, and the whole word means &quot;[plural properties] belong to his/her sons&quot;. The nested possessive structure and expression of plurals are quite remarkable (note that Hungarian uses no genders).

Persian has some features of agglutination, making use of prefixes and suffixes attached to the stems of verbs and nouns. Persian is an SOV language, thus having a head-final phrase structure. Persian utilizes a noun root + plural suffix + case suffix + postposition suffix syntax similar to Turkish. For example, the phrase &quot;Mashinhayeshan-ra negah mikardam/ماشین‌های‌شان را نگاه می‌کردم&quot; meaning &#x27;I was looking at their cars&#x27; lit. &#x27;(at their cars) (look) (I was doing)&#x27;. 
Breaking down the first word:
 ماشین(car)+(ها(ی(plural suffix)+شان(possessive suffix)+را(post-positional suffix) 
We can see its agglutinative nature and the fact that Persian is able to affix a given number of dependent morphemes to a root morpheme (in this example, car).

Almost all Austronesian languages, such as Malay, and most Philippine languages, also belong to this category, thus enabling them to form new words from simple base forms. The Indonesian and Malay word &quot;mempertanggungjawabkan&quot; is formed by adding active-voice, causative and benefactive affixes to the compound verb &quot;tanggung jawab&quot;, which means &quot;to account for&quot;. In Tagalog (and its standardised register, Filipino), &quot;nakakapágpabagabag&quot; (&quot;that which is upsetting/disturbing&quot;) is formed from the root &quot;bagabag&quot; (&quot;upsetting&quot; or &quot;disquieting&quot;).

In East Asia, Korean is an agglutinating language. Its uses of &#x27;조사&#x27;, &#x27;접사&#x27;, and &#x27;어미&#x27; makes Korean agglutinate. They represent tense, time, number, causality, and honorific forms.

Japanese is also an agglutinating language, like Korean, adding information such as negation, passive voice, past tense, honorific degree and causality in the verb form. Common examples would be , which combines causative, passive or potential, and conditional conjugations to arrive at two meanings depending on context &quot;if (subject) had been made to work...&quot; and &quot;if (subject) could make (object) work&quot;, and , which combines desire, negation, and past tense conjugations to mean &quot;I/he/she/they did not want to eat&quot;.
*

Turkish, along with all other Turkic languages, is another agglutinating language: as an extreme example, the expression is pronounced as one word in Turkish, but it can be translated into English as &quot;as if you were of those we would not be able to turn into a maker of unsuccessful ones&quot;. The &quot;-siniz&quot; refers to plural form of you with &quot;-sin&quot; being the singular form, the same way &quot;-im&quot; being &quot;I&quot; (&quot;-im&quot; means &quot;my&quot; not &quot;I&quot;. The original editor must have mistaken it for &quot;-yim&quot;. This second suffix is used as such &quot;Oraya gideyim&quot; meaning &quot;May I go there&quot; or &quot;When I get there&quot;) and &quot;-imiz&quot; making it become &quot;we&quot;. Similarly, this suffix means &quot;our&quot; and not &quot;we&quot;.

Tamil is agglutinative. For example, in Tamil, the word &quot;&quot; () means &quot;for the sake of those who cannot do that&quot;, literally &quot;that to do impossible he [plural marker] [dative marker] to become&quot;. Another example is verb conjugation. In all Dravidian languages, verbal markers are used to convey tense, person, and mood. For example, in Tamil, &quot;&quot; (, &quot;I eat&quot;) is formed from the verb root (, &quot;to eat&quot;) + the present tense marker () + the first-person singular suffix ().

Agglutination is also a notable feature of Basque. The conjugation of verbs, for example, is done by adding different prefixes or suffixes to the root of the verb: &quot;dakartzat&quot;, which means &quot;I bring them&quot;, is formed by &quot;da&quot; (indicates present tense), &quot;kar&quot; (root of the verb &quot;ekarri&quot; → bring), &quot;tza&quot; (indicates plural) and &quot;t&quot; (indicates subject, in this case, &quot;I&quot;). Another example would be the declension: &quot;Etxean&quot; = &quot;In the house&quot; where &quot;etxe&quot; = house.

===Americas===

Agglutination is used very heavily in most Native American languages, such as the Inuit languages, Nahuatl, Mapudungun, Quechua, Tz&#x27;utujil, Kaqchikel, Cha&#x27;palaachi and Kʼicheʼ, where one word can contain enough morphemes to convey the meaning of what would be a complex sentence in other languages. Conversely, Navajo contains affixes for some uses, but overlays them in such unpredictable and inseparable ways that it is often referred to as a fusional language.

== Slots ==

As noted above, it is a typical feature of agglutinative languages that there is a one-to-one correspondence between suffixes and syntactic categories. For example, a noun may have separate markers for number, case, possessive or conjunctive usage etc. The order of these affixes is fixed; so we may view any given noun or verb as a stem followed by several inflectional and derivational &quot;slots&quot;, i.e. positions in which particular suffixes may occur, and/or preceded by several &quot;slots&quot; for prefixes. It is often the case that the most common instance of a given grammatical category is unmarked, i.e. the corresponding affix is empty.

The number of slots for a given part of speech can be surprisingly high. For example, a finite Korean verb has seven slots (the inner round brackets indicate parts of morphemes which may be omitted in some phonological environments):

# honorific: &quot;-(eu)si&quot; ((으)시) is used when the speaker is honouring the subject of the sentence
# tense: &quot;-(eo)ss&quot; (었) for completed (past) action or state; when this slot is empty, the tense is interpreted as present (The &#x27;ss&#x27; is pronounced as &#x27;t&#x27; if it is placed behind a consonant. For example, -었어(eoss-eo) is pronounced as (eosseo), but -었다(eoss-ta) is pronounced as (eotta). Please note that the same rule applies to all instances of the &#x27;ss&#x27; ending.)
# experiential-contrastive aspect: &quot;-(eo)ss&quot; (었) doubling the past tense marker means &quot;the subject has had the experience described by the verb&quot;
# modal: &quot;-gess&quot; (겠) is used with first-person-subjects only for definite future and with second-or-third-person-subjects also for probable present or past
# formal: &quot;-(eu)pni&quot; ((으)ㅂ니) expresses politeness to the hearer
# retrospective aspect: &quot;-deo&quot;; (더) indicates that the speaker recollects what he observed in the past and reports in the present situation
# mood: &quot;-da&quot; (다) for declarative, &quot;-kka&quot; (까) for interrogative, &quot;-ra/-la&quot; (라) for imperative, &quot;-ja&quot; (자) for propositive, &quot;-yo&quot; (요) for polite declarative and a large number of other possible mood markers

Moreover, passive and causative verbal forms can be derived by adding suffixes to the base, which could be seen as the null-th slot.

Even though some combinations of suffixes are not possible (e.g. only one of the aspect slots may be filled with a non-empty suffix), over 400 verb forms may be formed from a single base. Here are a few examples formed from the word root &quot;ga&quot; &#x27;to go&#x27;; the numbers indicate which slots contain non-empty suffixes:

* 7 (imperative mood marker): imperative suffix &quot;-ra&quot; (라) combines with the root &quot;ga-&quot; (가) to express imperative:
*: &quot;ga-ra&quot; (가라) &#x27;Go!&#x27;
* 7 (propositive mood marker): if we want to express proposition rather than command, the propositive mood marker is used: &quot;-ja&quot; (자) instead of &quot;-ra&quot; (라):
*: &quot;ga-ja&quot; (가자) &#x27;Let&#x27;s go!&#x27;
* 5 and 7: If the speaker wants to show respect for the hearer, he uses the politeness marker &quot;-(eu)pni&quot; ((으)ㅂ니) (in slot 5); various mood markers may be simultaneously used (in slot 7, therefore after the politeness marker):
*: &quot;gap-ni-da&quot; (갑니다) &#x27;He is going.&#x27;
*: &quot;gap-ni-kka?&quot; (갑니까) &#x27;Is he going?&#x27;
* 6: retrospective aspect:
*: &quot;Jon-i jib-e ga-deo-ra&quot; (존이 집에 가더라) &#x27;I observed that John was going home and now I am reporting that to you.&#x27;
* 7: simple indicative:
*: &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e gan-da&quot; (선생님이 집에 간다) &#x27;The teacher is going home. (not expressing respect or politeness)&#x27;
* 5 and 7: politeness towards the hearer:
*: &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e gap-ni-da&quot; (선생님이 집에 갑니다) or &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e ga-yo&quot; (선생님이 집에 가요) &#x27;The teacher is going home.&#x27;,
* 1 and 7: respect towards the subject:
*: &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e ga-sin-da&quot; (선생님이 집에 가신다) &#x27;The (respected) teacher is going home.&#x27;
* 1, 5 and 7: two kinds of politeness in one sentence:
*: &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e ga-syeo-yo&quot; (선생님이 집에 가셔요) or &quot;seon-saeng-nim-i jib-e ga-sip-ni-da&quot; (선생님이 집에 가십니다) &#x27;The teacher is going home. (expressing respect both to the hearer and the teacher)&#x27;
* 2, 3 and 7: past forms:
*: &quot;Jon-i hak-gyo-e ga-ss-da/gat-ta&quot; (존이 학교에 갔다) &#x27;John has gone to school (and is there now).&#x27;
*: &quot;Jon-i hak-gyo-e gass-eoss-da/gass-eot-ta&quot; (존이 학교에 갔었다) &#x27;John has been to school (and has come back).&#x27;
* 4 and 7: first person modal:
*: &quot;nae-ga nae-il ga-gess-da/ga-get-ta&quot; (내가 내일 가겠다) &#x27;I will go tomorrow.&#x27;
* 4 and 7: third person modal:
*: &quot;Jon-i nae-il ga-gess-da/ga-get-ta&quot; (존이 내일 가겠다) &#x27;I suppose that John will go tomorrow.&#x27;
*: &quot;Jon-i eo-je gass-gess-da/gat-get-ta&quot; (존이 어제 갔겠다) &#x27;I suppose that John left yesterday.&#x27;

== Suffixing or prefixing ==

Although most agglutinative languages in Europe and Asia are predominantly suffixing, the Bantu languages of eastern and southern Africa are known for a highly complex mixture of prefixes, suffixes and reduplication. A typical feature of this language family is that nouns fall into noun classes. For each noun class, there are specific singular and plural prefixes, which also serve as markers of agreement between the subject and the verb. Moreover, the noun determines prefixes of all words that modify it and subject determines prefixes of other elements in the same verb phrase.

For example, the Swahili nouns &quot;-toto&quot; (&quot;child&quot;) and &quot;-tu&quot; (&quot;person&quot;) fall into class 1, with singular prefix &quot;m-&quot; and plural prefix &quot;wa-&quot;. The noun &quot;-tabu&quot; (&quot;book&quot;) falls into class 7, with singular prefix &quot;ki-&quot; and plural prefix &quot;vi-&quot;. The following sentences may be formed:



== In the context of quantitative linguistics ==

The American linguist Joseph Harold Greenberg in his 1960 paper proposed to use the so-called &quot;agglutinative index&quot; to calculate a numerical value that would allow a researcher to compare the &quot;degree of agglutitativeness&quot; of various languages. For Greenberg, &quot;agglutination&quot; means that the morphs are joined only with slight or no modification. A morpheme is said to be automatic if it either takes a single surface form (morph), or if its surface form is determined by phonological rules that hold in all similar instances in that language. A morph juncturea position in a word where two morphs meetis considered agglutinative when both morphemes included are automatic. The index of agglutination is equal to the average ratio of the number of agglutinative junctures to the number of morph junctures. Languages with high values of the agglutinative index are agglutinative and with low values of the agglutinative index are fusional.

In the same paper, Greenberg proposed several other indices, many of which turn out to be relevant to the study of agglutination. The &quot;synthetic index&quot; is the average number of morphemes per word, with the lowest conceivable value equal to 1 for isolating (analytic) languages and real-life values rarely exceeding 3. The compounding index is equal to the average number of root morphemes per word (as opposed to derivational and inflectional morphemes). The derivational, inflectional, prefixial and suffixial indices correspond respectively to the average number of derivational and inflectional morphemes, prefixes and suffixes.

Here is a table of sample values:

== Phonetics and agglutination ==

The one-to-one relationship between an affix and its grammatical function may be somewhat complicated by the phonological processes active in the given language. For example, the following two phonological phenomena appear in many of the Uralic and Turkic languages:

* &quot;consonant gradation&quot;, meaning that there is alternation between certain pairs of consonant clusters such that one member of the pair appears at the beginning of an open syllable and the other at the beginning of a closed syllable; (in Uralic languages)
* consonant devoicing assimilation: similar but different process from above, assimilating devoicing of a stem-final unvoiced consonant; (in some Turkic languages)
* &quot;vowel harmony&quot;, meaning that only specific subclasses of vowels coexist in a non-compounded word.

Several examples from Finnish will illustrate how these two rules and other phonological processes lead to diversions from the basic one-to-one relationship between morphs and their syntactic and semantic function. No phonological rule is applied in the declension of &quot;talo&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;. However, the second example illustrates several kinds of phonological phenomena.

==Extremes==
It is possible to construct artificially extreme examples of agglutination, which have no real use, but illustrate the theoretical capability of the grammar to agglutinate. This is not a question of &quot;long words&quot;, because some languages permit limitless combinations with compound words, negative clitics or such, which can be (and are) expressed with an analytic structure in actual usage.

English is capable of agglutinating morphemes of solely native (Germanic) origin, as &quot;un-whole-some-ness&quot;, but generally speaking the longest words are assembled from forms of Latin or Ancient Greek origin. The classic example is &quot;antidisestablishmentarianism&quot;. Agglutinative languages often have more complex derivational agglutination than isolating languages, so they can do the same to a much larger extent. For example, in Hungarian, a word such as , which means &quot;for [the purposes of] undenationalizationability&quot; can find actual use. In the same way, there are the words that have meaning, but probably are never used such as , which means &quot;like the most of most undesecratable ones of you&quot;, but is hard to decipher even for native speakers. Using inflectional agglutination, these can be extended. For example, the official Guinness world record is Finnish &quot;I wonder if – even with his/her quality of not having been made unsystematized&quot;. It has the derived word as the root and is lengthened with the inflectional endings &quot;-llänsäkäänköhän&quot;. However, this word is grammatically unusual, because &quot;-kään&quot; &quot;also&quot; is used only in negative clauses, but &quot;-kö&quot; (question) only in question clauses.

A very popular Turkish agglutination is , meaning &quot;(Apparently / I&#x27;ve heard that) You are one of those that we were not able to convert into Czechoslovakians&quot;. This historical reference is used as a joke for the individuals who are hard to change or those who stick out in a group.

On the other hand, is a longer word that does not surprise people and means &quot;As if you were one of those we were able to make resemble people from Afyonkarahisar&quot;. A recent addition to the claims has come with the introduction of the following word in Turkish , which means something like &quot;(you are talking) as if you are one of those that we were unable to turn into a maker of unsuccessful people&quot; (someone who un-educates people to make them unsuccessful).

Georgian is also a highly agglutinative language. For example, the word () would mean &quot;(someone not specified) said that it is also for those who are like the ones who need to be to again/back counter-revolutionized&quot;.

Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;Assemblywomen&quot; includes the Greek word , a fictional dish named with a word that enumerates its ingredients. It was created to ridicule a trend for long compounds in Attic Greek at the time.

Slavic languages are not considered agglutinative but fusional. However, extreme derivations similar to ones found in typical agglutinative languages do exist. A famous example is the Bulgarian word &quot;непротивоконституциослователствувайте&quot;, meaning &quot;don&#x27;t speak against the constitution&quot; and secondarily &quot;don&#x27;t act against the constitution&quot;. It is composed of just three roots: против &quot;against&quot;, конституция &quot;constitution&quot;, a loan word and therefore devoid of its internal composition and слово &quot;word&quot;. The remaining are bound morphemes for negation (&quot;не&quot;, a proclitic, otherwise written separately in verbs), noun intensifier (&quot;-ателств&quot;), noun-to-verb conversion (&quot;-ува&quot;), imperative mood second person plural ending (&quot;-йте&quot;). It is rather unusual, but finds some usage, e.g. newspaper headlines on 13 July 1991, the day after the current Bulgarian constitution was adopted with much controversy and debate, and even scandals.

== Other uses of the words &quot;agglutination&quot; and &quot;agglutinative&quot; ==

The words &quot;agglutination&quot; and &quot;agglutinative&quot; come from the Latin word &quot;agglutinare&quot;, &#x27;to glue together&#x27;. In linguistics, these words have been in use since 1836, when Wilhelm von Humboldt&#x27;s posthumously published work &quot;Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwicklung des Menschengeschlechts&quot; [lit.: On the differences of human language construction and its influence on the mental development of mankind] introduced the division of languages into &quot;isolating&quot;, &quot;inflectional&quot;, &quot;agglutinative&quot; and &quot;incorporating&quot;.

Especially in some older literature, &quot;agglutinative&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;synthetic&quot;. In that case, it embraces what we call agglutinative and inflectional languages, and it is an antonym of &quot;analytic&quot; or &quot;isolating&quot;. Besides the clear etymological motivation (after all, inflectional endings are also &quot;glued&quot; to the stems), this more general usage is justified by the fact that the distinction between agglutinative and inflectional languages is not a sharp one, as we have already seen.

In the second half of the 19th century, many linguists believed that there is a natural cycle of language evolution: function words of the isolating type are glued to their head-words, so that the language becomes agglutinative; later morphs become merged through phonological processes, and what comes out is an inflectional language; finally inflectional endings are often dropped in quick speech, inflection is omitted and the language goes back to the isolating type.

The following passage from Lord (1960) demonstrates well the whole range of meanings that the word &quot;agglutination&quot; may have.
(&quot;Agglutination&quot;...) consists of the welding together of two or more terms constantly occurring as a syntagmatic group into a single unit, which becomes either difficult or impossible to analyse thereafter.

Agglutination takes various forms. In French, welding becomes complete fusion. Latin &quot;hanc horam&quot; &#x27;at this hour&#x27; is the French adverbial unit &quot;encore&quot;. Old French &quot;tous jours&quot; becomes &quot;toujours&quot;, and &quot;dès jà&quot; (&#x27;since now&#x27;) &quot;déjà&quot; (&#x27;already&#x27;). In English, on the other hand, apart from rare combinations such as &quot;good-bye&quot; from &quot;God be with you&quot;, &quot;walnut&quot; from &quot;Wales nut&quot;, &quot;window&quot; from &quot;wind-eye&quot; (O.N. &quot;vindauga&quot;), the units making up the agglutinated forms retain their identity. Words like &quot;blackbird&quot; and &quot;beefeater&quot; are a different kettle of fish; they retain their units but their ultimate meaning is not fully deducible from these units. (...)

Saussure preferred to distinguish between &quot;compound&quot; words and truly &quot;synthesised&quot; or agglutinated combinations.

== Agglutinative languages in natural language processing ==

In natural language processing, languages with rich morphology pose problems of quite a different kind than isolating languages. In the case of agglutinative languages, the main obstacle lies in the large number of word forms that can be obtained from a single root. As we have already seen, the generation of these word forms is somewhat complicated by the phonological processes of the particular language. Although the basic one-to-one relationship between form and syntactic function is not broken in Finnish, the authoritative institution Institute for the Languages of Finland (&quot;Kotus&quot;) lists 51 declension types for Finnish nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals.

Even more problems occur with the recognition of word forms. Modern linguistic methods are largely based on the exploitation of corpora; however, when the number of possible word forms is large, any corpus will necessarily contain only a small fraction of them. Hajič (2010) claims that computer space and power are so cheap nowadays that all possible word forms may be generated beforehand and stored in a form of a lexicon listing all possible interpretations of any given word form. (The data structure of the lexicon has to be optimized so that the search is quick and efficient.) According to Hajič, it is the disambiguation of these word forms which is difficult (more so for inflective languages where the ambiguity is high than for agglutinative languages).

Other authors do not share Hajič&#x27;s view that space is no issue and instead of listing all possible word forms in a lexicon, word form analysis is implemented by modules which try to break up the surface form into a sequence of morphemes occurring in an order permissible by the language. The problem of such an analysis is the large number of morpheme boundaries typical for agglutinative languages. A word of an inflectional language has only one ending and therefore the number of possible divisions of a word into the base and the ending is only linear with the length of the word. In an agglutinative language, where several suffixes are concatenated at the end of the word, the number of different divisions which have to be checked for consistency is large. This approach was used for example in the development of a system for Arabic, where agglutination occurs when articles, prepositions
and conjunctions are joined with the following word and pronouns are joined with the preceding word. See Grefenstette et al. (2005) for more details.

<text>Richard Mervyn Hare (21 March 1919 – 29 January 2002), usually cited as R. M. Hare, was a British moral philosopher who held the post of White&#x27;s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford from 1966 until 1983. He subsequently taught for a number of years at the University of Florida. His meta-ethical theories were influential during the second half of the twentieth century.

Hare is best known for his development of prescriptivism as a meta-ethical theory, which he argues is supported by analysis of formal features of moral discourse, and for his defence of preference utilitarianism based on his prescriptivism.

Some of Hare&#x27;s students, such as Brian McGuinness, John Lucas, and Bernard Williams went on to become well-known philosophers. Hare&#x27;s son, John E. Hare, also became a philosopher. Peter Singer, known for his involvement with the animal liberation movement (who studied Hare&#x27;s work as an honours student at the University of Melbourne and came to know Hare personally while he was an Oxford BPhil graduate student), has explicitly adopted some elements of Hare&#x27;s thought, though not his doctrine of universal prescriptivism.

==Life and career==
Richard Hare was born on 21 March 1919 in Backwell, Somerset. He attended Rugby School in Warwickshire, followed in 1937 by Balliol College, Oxford, where he read greats (classics). Having joined the officer training corps whist still at Rugby, on the outbreak of World War II, he volunteered to serve with the Royal Artillery.

Hare was taken as a prisoner of war by the Japanese from the fall of Singapore in 1942 to the end of the Second World War. Hare&#x27;s wartime experience had a lasting impact on his philosophical views, particularly his view that moral philosophy has an obligation to help people live their lives as moral beings. His earliest work in philosophy, which has never been published, dates from this period, and in it, he tried to develop a system that might &quot;serve as a guide to life in the harshest conditions&quot;, according to C. C. W. Taylor.

He returned to Oxford after the war, and in 1947, married Catherine Verney, a marriage that produced a son and three daughters. (Hare&#x27;s son, John E. Hare, is also a philosopher.) He was elected fellow and tutor in philosophy at Balliol from 1947 to 1966; honorary fellow at Balliol from 1974 to 2002; and was appointed Wilde Lecturer in Natural Religion, 1963–66; and White&#x27;s Professor of Moral Philosophy, 1966–1983, which accompanied a move to Corpus Christi. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1972 to 1973. He left Oxford in 1983 to become Graduate Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of Florida at Gainesville, a post he held until 1994.

After suffering a series of strokes, R. M. Hare died in Ewelme, Oxfordshire, on 29 January 2002.

At his memorial service held at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Oxford, in May of that year, Peter Singer delivered (as he felt Hare would have wished) a lecture on Hare&#x27;s &quot;Achievements in Moral Philosophy&quot; which concluded by giving three &quot;major, lasting&quot; ones, namely, &quot;restoring reason to moral argument, distinguishing intuitive and critical levels of moral thinking, and pioneering the development of ... applied ethics&quot;.

==Influences==

Hare was greatly influenced by the emotivism of A. J. Ayer and Charles L. Stevenson, the ordinary language philosophy of J. L. Austin, a certain reading of the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, utilitarianism, and Immanuel Kant.

Hare took a view on religion in line with R. B. Braithwaite&#x27;s &quot;An Empiricist&#x27;s View of the Nature of Religious Belief&quot;, which he cited as &quot;the best thing on this subject [he] had ever heard or read&quot;.

Hare held that ethical rules should not be based on a principle of utility, though he took into account utilitarian considerations. His hybrid approach to meta-ethics distinguishes him from classical utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham. His book &quot;Sorting Out Ethics&quot; might be interpreted as saying that Hare is as much a Kantian as he is a utilitarian, but other sources disagree with this assessment. Although Hare used many concepts from Kant, especially the idea of universalisability, he was still a consequentialist, rather than a deontologist, in his normative ethical views. Hare himself addressed the possibility that Kant was a utilitarian like himself, in his &quot;Could Kant Have Been a Utilitarian?&quot;

==Universal prescriptivism==

In a series of books, especially &quot;The Language of Morals&quot; (1952), &quot;Freedom and Reason&quot; (1963), and &quot;Moral Thinking&quot; (1981), Hare gave shape to a theory that he called universal prescriptivism. According to this, moral terms such as &#x27;good&#x27;, &#x27;ought&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; have two logical or semantic properties: universalizability and prescriptivity. By the former, he meant that moral judgments must identify the situation they describe according to a finite set of universal terms, excluding proper names, but not definite descriptions. By the latter, he meant that moral agents must perform those acts they consider themselves to have an obligation to perform whenever they are physically and psychologically able to do so. In other words, he argued that it made no sense for someone to say, sincerely: &quot;I ought to do X&quot;, and then fail to do X. This was identified by Frankena, Nobis and others as a major flaw in Hare&#x27;s system, as it appeared to take no account of &quot;akrasia&quot;, or weakness of the will.

Hare argued that the combination of universalizability and prescriptivity leads to a certain form of consequentialism, namely, preference utilitarianism. In brief, this means that we should act in such a way as to maximise the satisfaction of people&#x27;s preferences.

==Importance of specificity==

Hare departs from Kant&#x27;s view that only the most general maxims of conduct be used (for example, &quot;do not steal&quot;), but the consequences ignored, when applying the categorical imperative. To ignore consequences leads to absurdity: for example, that it would be wrong to steal a terrorist&#x27;s plans to blow up a nuclear facility. All the specific facts of a circumstance must be considered, and these include probable consequences. They also include the relevant, universal properties of the facts: for example, the psychological states of those involved.

==Applied ethics and political philosophy==

While Hare was primarily interested in meta-ethics, he also made some important contributions to the fields of political philosophy and applied ethics. Among his essays within these fields those on the morality of slavery, abortion and the Golden Rule, and on demi-vegetarianism have received the most attention. Hare&#x27;s most important work in political philosophy and applied ethics is collected in the two volumes &quot;Essays on Political Morality&quot; (1989) and &quot;Essays on Bioethics&quot; (1993), both published by Oxford University Press.

<text>The woodcocks are a group of seven or eight very similar living species of sandpipers in the genus Scolopax. The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock, and until around 1800 was used to refer to a variety of waders. The English name is first recorded in about 1050. According to the &quot;Harleian Miscellany&quot;, a group of woodcocks is called a &quot;fall&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock. The type species is the Eurasian woodcock (&quot;Scolopax rusticola&quot;).

Only two woodcocks are widespread, the others being localized island endemics. Most are found in the Northern Hemisphere but a few range into the Greater Sundas, Wallacea and New Guinea. Their closest relatives are the typical snipes of the genus &quot;Gallinago&quot;. As with many other sandpiper genera, the lineages that led to &quot;Gallinago&quot; and &quot;Scolopax&quot; likely diverged around the Eocene, some 55.8–33.9 million years ago, although the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; is only known from the late Pliocene onwards.

Woodcock species are known to undergo rapid speciation in island chains, with the extant examples being the Amami woodcock in the Ryukyu Islands and the several species of woodcock in the Indonesian islands, the Philippines, and New Guinea. Subfossil evidence indicates the presence of another radiation of woodcock species in the Greater Antilles; these Caribbean woodcocks may have been more closely related to the Old World woodcock species than the New World ones, and were likely wiped out by human incursion into the region.

===Species===
The genus contains eight species:
*widespread species 
** American woodcock, &quot;Scolopax minor&quot; (large North American range)
** Eurasian woodcock, &quot;Scolopax rusticola&quot; (large Eurasian range)
*localized island endemic species
** Amami woodcock, &quot;Scolopax mira&quot; (endemic to the Amami Islands in Japan)
** Bukidnon woodcock, &quot;Scolopax bukidnonensis&quot; (endemic to Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines)
** Javan woodcock, &quot;Scolopax saturata&quot; (endemic to Sumatra and Java in Indonesia)
** New Guinea woodcock, &quot;Scolopax rosenbergii&quot; (endemic to New Guinea)
** Moluccan woodcock, &quot;Scolopax rochussenii&quot; (endemic to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia)
** Sulawesi woodcock, &quot;Scolopax celebensis&quot; (endemic to Sulawesi in Indonesia)

===Fossil record===
A number of woodcocks are extinct and are known only from fossil or subfossil bones.

* &quot;Scolopax baranensis&quot; (fossil, Early Pliocene of Hungary; a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;)
* &quot;Scolopax carmesinae&quot; (fossil, Early/Middle Pliocene? of Menorca, Mediterranean)
* &quot;Scolopax hutchensi&quot; (fossil, Late Pliocene – Early Pleistocene of Florida, USA)
* &quot;Scolopax anthonyi&quot; (prehistoric, Holocene of Puerto Rico)
* &quot;Scolopax brachycarpa&quot; (subfossil, Holocene of Hispaniola)

==Description and ecology==

Woodcocks have stocky bodies, cryptic brown and blackish plumage, and long slender bills. Their eyes are located on the sides of their heads, which gives them 360° vision. Unlike in most birds, the tip of the bill&#x27;s upper mandible is flexible.

As their common name implies, the woodcocks are woodland birds. They feed at night or in the evenings, searching for invertebrates in soft ground with their long bills. This habit and their unobtrusive plumage makes it difficult to see them when they are resting in the day. Most have distinctive displays known as &quot;roding&quot;, usually given at dawn or dusk.

The range of breeding habits of the Eurasian woodcock extends from the west of Ireland eastwards across Europe and Asia preferring mostly boreal forest regions engulfing northern Japan, and also from the northern limits of the tree zone in Norway. Continuing south to the Pyrenees and the northern limits of Spain. Nests have been found in Corsica and there are three isolated Atlantic breeding stations in Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. In Asia the sites can be seen as far south as Kashmir and the Himalayas.

==Hunting==
Some woodcocks have become popular gamebirds. The island-endemic species are often quite rare due to overhunting. The pin feathers (coverts of the leading primary feather of the wing) of the Eurasian woodcock are sometimes used by artists as brushtips for fine painting work.

The cocker spaniel dog breed is named after the bird: the dogs were originally bred to hunt the woodcock.

<doc id="243835" wikidata="Q8053799" url="?curid=243835" title="Yip Kai-foon">
<text>Yip Kai-foon (; 12 June 1961 – 19 April 2017), also known as &quot;Teeth Dog&quot; and &quot;Goosehead&quot;, was an infamous Chinese criminal who was most active in Hong Kong from the early 1980s to 1990s. He and his gang specialised in robbing jewellery stores with assault rifles. Their weapon of choice was the AK-47 assault rifle, which they acquired from black markets hosted by triads. He is also the first person to have used an AK-47 during an armed robbery in Hong Kong.

==Early crimes==
In October 1984, when he was 23, Yip led a gang of five armed mainland Chinese men into Hong Kong. They robbed two jewellery stores, King Fook Jewellery Co. Ltd on 10 October 1984 and Dickson Jewellery Co. Ltd. on 27 October 1984, managing to obtain more than  million worth of precious items. Shots were fired during the course of both robberies.

On 28 December 1984, the police carried out a sting operation involving an undercover policeman posed as a potential buyer for the stolen goods. Once the policeman identified himself, Yip attempted to shoot him and a violent struggle occurred. Yip was subdued and found with two handguns, later linked by ballistics to the October robberies.

Yip was convicted on four counts (two counts of handling stolen goods for each robbery, one count of possession of firearms, and one count of use of a firearm with intent to resist arrest) and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Yip contested the conviction, claiming that he was asked only to find a buyer for what he thought were sub-standard watches produced in local factories; his appeal was dismissed in 1987. Yip later escaped on 24 August 1989, when he faked appendicitis and was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital. In the toilet, he jumped his two officers with broken bottles and made off in a van parked at the hospital entrance. He hijacked the van with two occupants inside, a 37-year-old van driver and driver&#x27;s 6-year-old son. While driving, he forced the driver to take off their shoes and clothes so Yip could put them on. He got off at Wong Chuk Hang and left the scene by bus. He is presumed to have fled into mainland China.

==On the run==

===AK-47 heists===
On 9 June 1991, he and his gang, armed with AK-47s and pistols, robbed five goldsmiths shops on the &quot;Golden&quot; Mut Wah Street in Kwun Tong. They fired 54 shots at police and escaped with gold and jewellery worth  million. Many onlookers thought that the gun battle was being staged for a film.

The gang was linked to a robbery of two jewellers on Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po on 10 March 1992. During the course of that robbery, gang members fired 65 shots at police and members of the public, escaping with  million worth of jewellery.

Yip is thought to have been involved in a 6 January 1993 jewellery store robbery on Nathan Road in Mong Kok, when a gang fired 30 rounds from AK-47s, killing a woman passerby. One robber was shot by police during the chase; the others dumped his body on the street when they switched getaway cars.

Macau police suspected Yip was involved in an April 1994 armed heist of  million in gambling chips from the casino at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Taipa.

In 1995, Yip moved his crime operation to Shenzhen, participating in the January abduction and murder of a Tianjin businessman and the November murder of a police informant.

The total worth of his stolen goods is estimated at  million (approximately ). Yip achieved notoriety by escaping police custody multiple times.

===Capture and trial===
His career finally came to an end on 13 May 1996 when he was arrested following a Kennedy Town gunfight with police that left him paralyzed from the waist down. At the time he had a  million reward on his head, though the two officers involved did not receive the reward. Two police officers had surprised Yip and his gang in an alley near the waterfront. Since they had just debarked from a boat, the police suspected they were illegal immigrants and asked for identification. The rest of the gang fled, but Yip pulled a gun from a bag and began shooting. During an ensuing foot pursuit, the officers testified they ordered him to drop his gun, which he refused to do, instead shooting at the officers. After his gun jammed, he was captured. He was found with a machine gun, a pistol, and 1.8 kg of explosives.

He was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence, and shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm, stemming from wounds one of the officers received in the course of the arrest. While Yip was recovering from his injuries, additional charges of escaping custody and kidnapping (during the van hijacking) were added stemming from his 1989 escape.

During the lead-up to the trial, a fictionalised version of Yip&#x27;s life was filmed as &quot;King of Robbery&quot; (), also known as &quot;Life Will Never Be Twice&quot; and starring Simon Yam and Roy Cheung, but its planned August 1996 release was delayed by court order.

Yip&#x27;s trial began on 18 February 1997, with the defence claiming that the police shot Yip in the back and then stole from him. He dismissed his defence team two days later, subsequently appearing to fall asleep when given the chance to cross-examine a prosecution witness.

On 10 March 1997, he was convicted of all charges and sentenced to 41 years in prison, which consists of the 11 years he had left on his original sentence and 30 years on the new charges, to be served consecutively. The earliest year in which he could have been released was 2022.

==Imprisonment and death==
Yip&#x27;s lawyers appealed his conviction, stating that the publicity surrounding his arrest was prejudicial to the jury, but lost the appeal on 8 December 1998. A separate appeal to reduce his sentence, based on his injuries and subsequent care, was heard in March 1999. The Court of Appeal reduced his sentence by approximately five years. Yip then went to the Court of Final Appeal seeking a further reduction in his sentence based on his &quot;catastrophic&quot; medical condition, but the appeal was denied. Yip continued to maintain his innocence over the 1996 shootout, offering a substantial reward for a witness who he alleges saw the events leading up to his arrest.

In August 2003, Yip married his mainland Chinese wife, who he had previously been married to under a false name before his imprisonment. In March 2004, Yip converted to Christianity.

On 11 January 2010, Yip was sentenced to an additional six months in jail for assaulting an officer at Stanley Prison on 30 April 2009. He had complained that he had been badly treated by prison guards.

On 1 April 2017, he was hospitalised at Queen Mary Hospital for cancer treatment. He died on 19 April 2017 of lung cancer.

==Cultural influence==
Several documentaries detail Yip&#x27;s exploits and several fictional movies are adapted from his criminal history.
* &quot;The Most Dangerous Man&quot; (2010, ). Yim Foon portrayed by Karel Wong
* &quot;King of Robbery&quot; (1996, ). Chan Sing portrayed by Simon Yam
* &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s King of Thieves&quot; (). Yip Kai-foon portrayed by Chan Wah
* &quot;Trivisa&quot; (2016). Yip Kwok-foon portrayed by Richie Jen

<text>The curlews () are a group of nine species of birds in the genus Numenius, characterised by their long, slender, downcurved bills and mottled brown plumage. The English name is imitative of the Eurasian curlew&#x27;s call, but may have been influenced by the Old French &quot;corliu&quot;, &quot;messenger&quot;, from &quot;courir &quot;, &quot;to run&quot;. It was first recorded in 1377 in Langland&#x27;s Piers Plowman &quot;Fissch to lyue in þe flode..Þe corlue by kynde of þe eyre&quot;. In Europe, &quot;curlew&quot; usually refers to one species, the Eurasian curlew (&quot;Numenius arquata&quot;).

==Description==
They are one of the most ancient lineages of scolopacid waders, together with the godwits which look similar but have straight bills. Curlews feed on mud or very soft ground, searching for worms and other invertebrates with their long bills. They will also take crabs and similar items.

== Distribution ==
Curlews enjoy a worldwide distribution. Most species exhibit strong migratory habits and consequently one or more species can be encountered at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia.

The distribution of curlews has altered considerably in the past hundred years as a result of changing agricultural practices. For instance, Eurasian curlew populations have suffered due to draining of marshes for farmland, whereas long-billed curlews have shown an increase in breeding densities around areas grazed by livestock. , there were only a small number of Eurasian curlews still breeding in Ireland, raising concerns that the bird will become extinct in that country.

The stone-curlews are not true curlews (family Scolopacidae) but members of the family Burhinidae, which is in the same order Charadriiformes, but only distantly related within that.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Numenius&quot; was erected by the French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; published in 1760. The type species is the Eurasian curlew (&quot;Numenius arquata&quot;). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus &quot;Numenius&quot; in the 6th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the curlews together with the woodcocks in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot;. As the publication date of Linnaeus&#x27;s sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson and not Linnaeus is considered as the authority for the genus. The name &quot;Numenius&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;noumenios&quot;, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from &quot;neos&quot;, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;mene&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, referring to the crescent-shaped bill.

The genus contains nine species:








The following cladogram shows the genetic relationships between the species. It is based on a study published in 2023.


The Late Eocene (Montmartre Formation, some 35 mya) fossil &quot;Limosa gypsorum&quot; of France was originally placed in &quot;Numenius&quot; and may in fact belong there. Apart from that, a Late Pleistocene curlew from San Josecito Cave, Mexico has been described. This fossil was initially placed in a distinct genus, &quot;Palnumenius&quot;, but was actually a chronospecies or paleosubspecies related to the long-billed curlew.

The upland sandpiper (&quot;Bartramia longicauda&quot;) is an odd bird which is the closest relative of the curlews. It is distinguished from them by its yellow legs, long tail, and shorter, less curved bill.

<doc id="243844" wikidata="Q15107669" url="?curid=243844" title="Extraterrestrial intelligence">
<text>Extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) refers to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrial life. No such life has ever been verifiably observed to exist. The question of whether other inhabited worlds might exist has been debated since ancient times. The modern form of the concept emerged when the Copernican Revolution demonstrated that the Earth was a planet revolving around the Sun, and other planets were, conversely, other worlds. The question of whether other inhabited planets or moons exist was a natural consequence of this new understanding. It has become one of the most speculative questions in science and is a central theme of science fiction and popular culture.

An alternative name for it is &quot;Extraterrestrial Technological Instantiations&quot; (ETI). The term was coined to avoid the use of terms such as &quot;civilizations&quot; &quot;species&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot;, as those may prove to be ambiguous and open to interpretation, or simply inapplicable in its local context.

==Intelligence==
Intelligence is, along with the more precise concept of sapience, used to describe extraterrestrial life with similar cognitive abilities as humans. Another interchangeable term is &quot;&quot;, being wise or wiser, first coined by Karen Anderson and published in the 1966 works by her husband Poul Anderson.

Sentience, like consciousness, is a concept sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the concept of intelligence and sapience, since it does not exclude forms of life that are non-sapient (or more broadly non-intelligent or non-conscious).

The term &quot;extraterrestrial civilization&quot; frames a more particular case of extraterrestrial intelligence. It is the possible long-term result of intelligent and specifically sapient extraterrestrial life.

==Probability==
The Copernican principle is generalized to the relativistic concept that humans are not privileged observers of the universe. Many prominent scientists, including Stephen Hawking have proposed that the sheer scale of the universe makes it improbable for intelligent life not to have emerged elsewhere. However, Fermi&#x27;s Paradox highlights the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and humanity&#x27;s lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations.

So far, there is no observation of extraterrestrial life, including intelligent extraterrestrial life.

The Kardashev scale is a speculative method of measuring a civilization&#x27;s level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize.

The Drake equation is a probabilistic framework used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.

==Search for extraterrestrial intelligence==
There has been a search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence for several decades, with no significant results. Active SETI (Active Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life. Active SETI messages are usually sent in the form of radio signals. Physical messages like that of the Pioneer plaque may also be considered an active SETI message.

Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (CETI) is a branch of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. The best-known CETI experiment was the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan. There are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research.

The U.S. government&#x27;s position, in line with that of most relevant experts, is that &quot;chances of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence are extremely small, given the distances involved.&quot; This line of thinking has led some to conclude that first contact might be made with extraterrestrial artificial intelligence, rather than with biological beings.

The Wow! signal remains the best candidate for an extraterrestrial radio signal ever detected, though the fact that no similar signal has ever been observed again makes attribution of the signal to any cause difficult if not impossible.

On 14 June 2022 astronomers working with China&#x27;s FAST telescope reported the possibility of having detected artificial (presumably alien) signals, but cautions that further studies are required to determine if some kind of natural radio interference may be the source. On 18 June 2022 Dan Werthimer, chief scientist for several SETI-related projects, reportedly noted that “These signals are from radio interference; they are due to radio pollution from earthlings, not from E.T.”

== Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact ==
The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization&#x27;s level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.

The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a technologically superior civilization, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, a historical precedent being the Columbian Exchange. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the &quot;contactor&quot;, which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome. However, the absence of any such contact to date means such conjecture is largely speculative.

==UFOlogy==
The extraterrestrial hypothesis is the idea that some UFOs are vehicles containing or sent by extraterrestrial beings (usually called &quot;aliens&quot; in this context). As an explanation for UFOs, ETI is sometimes contrasted with EDI (extradimensional intelligence), for example by J. Allen Hynek. In 2023, House lawmakers held a hearing to examine how the executive branch handles reports of UFOs.

==In culture==
The theories and reception of the probability of intelligent life has been a recurring cultural element, particularly of popular culture since the prospect and achievement of spaceflight.
New Mexico has even declared in 2003 the 14th of February as the &quot;Extraterrestrial Culture Day&quot;.

<doc id="243848" wikidata="Q33909" url="?curid=243848" title="Paleo-Siberian languages">
<text>The Paleo-Siberian languages are several language isolates and small language families spoken in parts of Siberia. They are not known to have any genetic relationship to each other; their only common link is that they are held to have antedated the more dominant languages, particularly Tungusic and latterly Turkic languages, that have largely displaced them. Even more recently, Turkic (at least in Siberia) and especially Tungusic have been displaced in their turn by Russian.

==Classifications==
Four small language families and isolates are usually considered to be Paleo-Siberian languages:

# The Chukotko-Kamchatkan family, sometimes known as Luoravetlan, includes Chukchi and its close relatives, Koryak, Alutor and Kerek. Itelmen, also known as Kamchadal, is also distantly related. Chukchi, Koryak and Alutor are spoken in easternmost Siberia by communities numbering in the thousands (Chukchi) or hundreds (Koryak and Alutor). Kerek is extinct, and Itelmen is now spoken by fewer than 5 people, mostly elderly, on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula.
# Nivkh (Gilyak, Amuric) consists of two or three languages spoken in the lower Amur basin and on the northern half of Sakhalin island. It has a recent modern literature.
# The Yeniseian languages were a small family formerly spoken on the middle Yenisei River and its tributaries, but are now represented only by Ket, spoken in the Turukhansk district of Krasnoyarsk Krai by no more than 200 people.
# Yukaghir is spoken in two mutually unintelligible varieties in the lower Kolyma and Indigirka valleys. Other languages, including Chuvan, spoken further inland and further east, are now extinct. Yukaghir is held by some to be related to the Uralic languages.

On the basis of morphological, typological, and lexical evidence, Michael Fortescue suggests that Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Nivkh (Amuric) are related, forming a larger &quot;Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric&quot; language family. Fortescue does not consider Yeniseian and Yukaghir to be genetically related to Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric.

==Relationships==
The purpose of the existence of Paleo-Siberian itself lies in its practicability and remains a grouping of convenience for a variety of unclassifiable language isolates located in Northeast Eurasia.

Ket, or more precisely the now largely extinct Yeniseian family, has been linked to the Na-Dené languages of North America. Dené–Yeniseian has been called &quot;the first demonstration of a genealogical link between Old World and New World language families that meets the standards of traditional comparative-historical linguistics&quot;. Attempts to connect it to Sino-Tibetan, North Caucasian and Burushaski have also been made.

Kim Bang-han proposed that placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; reflect the original language of the Korean peninsula and a component in the formation of both Korean and Japanese. It is suggested that this language was related to Nivkh in some form.
Juha Janhunen suggests the possibility that similar consonant stop systems in Koreanic and Nivkh may be due to ancient contact. Martine Robbeets suggests that Proto-Korean had a Nivkh substrate influence. Further parallel developments in their sound inventory (Old to Middle Korean and Proto-Nivkh to Nivkh) as well as commonalities in the syntax between Koreanic and Nivkh specifically have been observed. Alexander Vovin, in a criticism of the Altaic language grouping, has suggested that Korean shares similarities with other Pale-Siberian languages in several important respects (i.e. phonotactics, verb incorporation v. compounding, adjectives as verbs and not nominals).

The Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic languages predate the spread of Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages, but are part of the well established larger Uralic family, thus not Paleo-Siberian. Yukaghir has often been suggested as a more distant relative of Uralic as part of the Uralic-Yukaghir languages, as well as Eskimo-Aleut as part of the Uralo-Siberian languages. However, these hypotheses are controversial and not universally accepted.

==Vocabulary comparison==
Below are selected basic vocabulary items in proto-languages reconstructed for Paleo-Siberian languages and language families. Proto-Eskimo, Proto-Uralic, Proto-Ainu, Ainu, Proto-Korean and Proto-Japanese are also given for comparison.

<doc id="243849" wikidata="Q177409" url="?curid=243849" title="Projective geometry">
<text>In mathematics, projective geometry is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary Euclidean geometry, projective geometry has a different setting (&quot;projective space&quot;) and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called &quot;points at infinity&quot;) to Euclidean points, and vice versa.

Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. Unlike in Euclidean geometry, the concept of an angle does not apply in projective geometry, because no measure of angles is invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing from a changing perspective. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry&#x27;s terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See &quot;Projective plane&quot; for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.

While the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme resulting in the study of the classical groups) were motivated by projective geometry. It was also a subject with many practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry.

The topic of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research subtopics, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of projective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of differential invariants of the projective transformations).

== Overview ==
Projective geometry is an elementary non-metrical form of geometry, meaning that it does not support any concept of distance. In two dimensions it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines. That there is indeed some geometric interest in this sparse setting was first established by Desargues and others in their exploration of the principles of perspective art. In higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes (that always meet), and other linear subspaces, which exhibit the principle of duality. The simplest illustration of duality is in the projective plane, where the statements &quot;two distinct points determine a unique line&quot; (i.e. the line through them) and &quot;two distinct lines determine a unique point&quot; (i.e. their point of intersection) show the same structure as propositions. Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with a straight-edge alone, excluding compass constructions, common in straightedge and compass constructions. As such, there are no circles, no angles, no measurements, no parallels, and no concept of (or &quot;betweenness&quot;). It was realised that the theorems that do apply to projective geometry are simpler statements. For example, the different conic sections are all equivalent in (complex) projective geometry, and some theorems about circles can be considered as special cases of these general theorems.

During the early 19th century the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Lazare Carnot and others established projective geometry as an independent field of mathematics. Its rigorous foundations were addressed by Karl von Staudt and perfected by Italians Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Alessandro Padoa and Gino Fano during the late 19th century. Projective geometry, like affine and Euclidean geometry, can also be developed from the Erlangen program of Felix Klein; projective geometry is characterized by invariants under transformations of the projective group.

After much work on the very large number of theorems in the subject, therefore, the basics of projective geometry became understood. The incidence structure and the cross-ratio are fundamental invariants under projective transformations. Projective geometry can be modeled by the affine plane (or affine space) plus a line (hyperplane) &quot;at infinity&quot; and then treating that line (or hyperplane) as &quot;ordinary&quot;. An algebraic model for doing projective geometry in the style of analytic geometry is given by homogeneous coordinates. On the other hand, axiomatic studies revealed the existence of non-Desarguesian planes, examples to show that the axioms of incidence can be modelled (in two dimensions only) by structures not accessible to reasoning through homogeneous coordinate systems.

In a foundational sense, projective geometry and ordered geometry are elementary since they each involve a minimal set of axioms and either can be used as the foundation for affine and Euclidean geometry. Projective geometry is not &quot;ordered&quot; and so it is a distinct foundation for geometry.

== Description ==
Projective geometry is less restrictive than either Euclidean geometry or affine geometry. It is an intrinsically non-metrical geometry, meaning that facts are independent of any metric structure. Under the projective transformations, the incidence structure and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates are preserved. A projective range is the one-dimensional foundation. Projective geometry formalizes one of the central principles of perspective art: that parallel lines meet at infinity, and therefore are drawn that way. In essence, a projective geometry may be thought of as an extension of Euclidean geometry in which the &quot;direction&quot; of each line is subsumed within the line as an extra &quot;point&quot;, and in which a &quot;horizon&quot; of directions corresponding to coplanar lines is regarded as a &quot;line&quot;. Thus, two parallel lines meet on a horizon line by virtue of their incorporating the same direction.

Idealized directions are referred to as points at infinity, while idealized horizons are referred to as lines at infinity. In turn, all these lines lie in the plane at infinity. However, infinity is a metric concept, so a purely projective geometry does not single out any points, lines or planes in this regard—those at infinity are treated just like any others.

Because a Euclidean geometry is contained within a projective geometry—with projective geometry having a simpler foundation—general results in Euclidean geometry may be derived in a more transparent manner, where separate but similar theorems of Euclidean geometry may be handled collectively within the framework of projective geometry. For example, parallel and nonparallel lines need not be treated as separate cases; rather an arbitrary projective plane is singled out as the ideal plane and located &quot;at infinity&quot; using homogeneous coordinates.

Additional properties of fundamental importance include Desargues&#x27; Theorem and the Theorem of Pappus. In projective spaces of dimension 3 or greater there is a construction that allows one to prove Desargues&#x27; Theorem. But for dimension 2, it must be separately postulated.

Using Desargues&#x27; Theorem, combined with the other axioms, it is possible to define the basic operations of arithmetic, geometrically. The resulting operations satisfy the axioms of a field – except that the commutativity of multiplication requires Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem. As a result, the points of each line are in one-to-one correspondence with a given field, , supplemented by an additional element, ∞, such that , , , , , , except that , , , , and remain undefined.

Projective geometry also includes a full theory of conic sections, a subject also extensively developed in Euclidean geometry. There are advantages to being able to think of a hyperbola and an ellipse as distinguished only by the way the hyperbola &quot;lies across the line at infinity&quot;; and that a parabola is distinguished only by being tangent to the same line. The whole family of circles can be considered as &quot;conics passing through two given points on the line at infinity&quot; — at the cost of requiring complex coordinates. Since coordinates are not &quot;synthetic&quot;, one replaces them by fixing a line and two points on it, and considering the &quot;linear system&quot; of all conics passing through those points as the basic object of study. This method proved very attractive to talented geometers, and the topic was studied thoroughly. An example of this method is the multi-volume treatise by H. F. Baker.

== History ==
The first geometrical properties of a projective nature were discovered during the 3rd century by Pappus of Alexandria. Filippo Brunelleschi (1404–1472) started investigating the geometry of perspective during 1425 (see &quot;&quot; for a more thorough discussion of the work in the fine arts that motivated much of the development of projective geometry). Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) and Girard Desargues (1591–1661) independently developed the concept of the &quot;point at infinity&quot;. Desargues developed an alternative way of constructing perspective drawings by generalizing the use of vanishing points to include the case when these are infinitely far away. He made Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines are truly parallel, into a special case of an all-encompassing geometric system. Desargues&#x27;s study on conic sections drew the attention of 16-year-old Blaise Pascal and helped him formulate Pascal&#x27;s theorem. The works of Gaspard Monge at the end of 18th and beginning of 19th century were important for the subsequent development of projective geometry. The work of Desargues was ignored until Michel Chasles chanced upon a handwritten copy during 1845. Meanwhile, Jean-Victor Poncelet had published the foundational treatise on projective geometry during 1822. Poncelet examined the projective properties of objects (those invariant under central projection) and, by basing his theory on the concrete pole and polar relation with respect to a circle, established a relationship between metric and projective properties. The non-Euclidean geometries discovered soon thereafter were eventually demonstrated to have models, such as the Klein model of hyperbolic space, relating to projective geometry.

In 1855 A. F. Möbius wrote an article about permutations, now called Möbius transformations, of generalised circles in the complex plane. These transformations represent projectivities of the complex projective line. In the study of lines in space, Julius Plücker used homogeneous coordinates in his description, and the set of lines was viewed on the Klein quadric, one of the early contributions of projective geometry to a new field called algebraic geometry, an offshoot of analytic geometry with projective ideas.

Projective geometry was instrumental in the validation of speculations of Lobachevski and Bolyai concerning hyperbolic geometry by providing models for the hyperbolic plane: for example, the Poincaré disc model where generalised circles perpendicular to the unit circle correspond to &quot;hyperbolic lines&quot; (geodesics), and the &quot;translations&quot; of this model are described by Möbius transformations that map the unit disc to itself. The distance between points is given by a Cayley–Klein metric, known to be invariant under the translations since it depends on cross-ratio, a key projective invariant. The translations are described variously as isometries in metric space theory, as linear fractional transformations formally, and as projective linear transformations of the projective linear group, in this case .

The work of Poncelet, Jakob Steiner and others was not intended to extend analytic geometry. Techniques were supposed to be &quot;synthetic&quot;: in effect projective space as now understood was to be introduced axiomatically. As a result, reformulating early work in projective geometry so that it satisfies current standards of rigor can be somewhat difficult. Even in the case of the projective plane alone, the axiomatic approach can result in models not describable via linear algebra.

This period in geometry was overtaken by research on the general algebraic curve by Clebsch, Riemann, Max Noether and others, which stretched existing techniques, and then by invariant theory. Towards the end of the century, the Italian school of algebraic geometry (Enriques, Segre, Severi) broke out of the traditional subject matter into an area demanding deeper techniques.

During the later part of the 19th century, the detailed study of projective geometry became less fashionable, although the literature is voluminous. Some important work was done in enumerative geometry in particular, by Schubert, that is now considered as anticipating the theory of Chern classes, taken as representing the algebraic topology of Grassmannians.

Projective geometry later proved key to Paul Dirac&#x27;s invention of quantum mechanics. At a foundational level, the discovery that quantum measurements could fail to commute had disturbed and dissuaded Heisenberg, but past study of projective planes over noncommutative rings had likely desensitized Dirac. In more advanced work, Dirac used extensive drawings in projective geometry to understand the intuitive meaning of his equations, before writing up his work in an exclusively algebraic formalism.

== Classification ==
There are many projective geometries, which may be divided into discrete and continuous: a &quot;discrete&quot; geometry comprises a set of points, which may or may not be &quot;finite&quot; in number, while a &quot;continuous&quot; geometry has infinitely many points with no gaps in between.

The only projective geometry of dimension 0 is a single point. A projective geometry of dimension 1 consists of a single line containing at least 3 points. The geometric construction of arithmetic operations cannot be performed in either of these cases. For dimension 2, there is a rich structure in virtue of the absence of Desargues&#x27; Theorem.
The smallest 2-dimensional projective geometry (that with the fewest points) is the Fano plane, which has 3 points on every line, with 7 points and 7 lines in all, having the following collinearities:

* [ABC]
* [ADE]
* [AFG]
* [BDG]
* [BEF]
* [CDF]
* [CEG]

with homogeneous coordinates , , , , , , , or, in affine coordinates, , , , , , and . The affine coordinates in a Desarguesian plane for the points designated to be the points at infinity (in this example: C, E and G) can be defined in several other ways.

In standard notation, a finite projective geometry is written where:
: is the projective (or geometric) dimension, and
: is one less than the number of points on a line (called the &quot;order&quot; of the geometry).

Thus, the example having only 7 points is written .

The term &quot;projective geometry&quot; is used sometimes to indicate the generalised underlying abstract geometry, and sometimes to indicate a particular geometry of wide interest, such as the metric geometry of flat space which we analyse through the use of homogeneous coordinates, and in which Euclidean geometry may be embedded (hence its name, Extended Euclidean plane).

The fundamental property that singles out all projective geometries is the &quot;elliptic&quot; incidence property that any two distinct lines and in the projective plane intersect at exactly one point . The special case in analytic geometry of &quot;parallel&quot; lines is subsumed in the smoother form of a line &quot;at infinity&quot; on which lies. The &quot;line at infinity&quot; is thus a line like any other in the theory: it is in no way special or distinguished. (In the later spirit of the Erlangen programme one could point to the way the group of transformations can move any line to the &quot;line at infinity&quot;).

The parallel properties of elliptic, Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries contrast as follows:
: Given a line and a point not on the line,
::; &quot;Elliptic&quot; : there exists no line through that does not meet 
::; &quot;Euclidean&quot; : there exists exactly one line through that does not meet 
::; &quot;Hyperbolic&quot; : there exists more than one line through that does not meet 

The parallel property of elliptic geometry is the key idea that leads to the principle of projective duality, possibly the most important property that all projective geometries have in common.

== Duality ==
In 1825, Joseph Gergonne noted the principle of duality characterizing projective plane geometry: given any theorem or definition of that geometry, substituting &quot;point&quot; for &quot;line&quot;, &quot;lie on&quot; for &quot;pass through&quot;, &quot;collinear&quot; for &quot;concurrent&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot; for &quot;join&quot;, or vice versa, results in another theorem or valid definition, the &quot;dual&quot; of the first. Similarly in 3 dimensions, the duality relation holds between points and planes, allowing any theorem to be transformed by swapping &quot;point&quot; and &quot;plane&quot;, &quot;is contained by&quot; and &quot;contains&quot;. More generally, for projective spaces of dimension N, there is a duality between the subspaces of dimension &quot;R&quot; and dimension . For , this specializes to the most commonly known form of duality—that between points and lines.
The duality principle was also discovered independently by Jean-Victor Poncelet.

To establish duality only requires establishing theorems which are the dual versions of the axioms for the dimension in question. Thus, for 3-dimensional spaces, one needs to show that (1*) every point lies in 3 distinct planes, (2*) every two planes intersect in a unique line and a dual version of (3*) to the effect: if the intersection of plane P and Q is coplanar with the intersection of plane R and S, then so are the respective intersections of planes P and R, Q and S (assuming planes P and S are distinct from Q and R).

In practice, the principle of duality allows us to set up a &quot;dual correspondence&quot; between two geometric constructions. The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions). A commonplace example is found in the reciprocation of a symmetrical polyhedron in a concentric sphere to obtain the dual polyhedron.

Another example is Brianchon&#x27;s theorem, the dual of the already mentioned Pascal&#x27;s theorem, and one of whose proofs simply consists of applying the principle of duality to Pascal&#x27;s. Here are comparative statements of these two theorems (in both cases within the framework of the projective plane):
* Pascal: If all six vertices of a hexagon lie on a conic, then the intersections of its opposite sides &quot;(regarded as full lines, since in the projective plane there is no such thing as a &quot;line segment&quot;)&quot; are three collinear points. The line joining them is then called the Pascal line of the hexagon.
* Brianchon: If all six sides of a hexagon are tangent to a conic, then its diagonals (i.e. the lines joining opposite vertices) are three concurrent lines. Their point of intersection is then called the Brianchon point of the hexagon.
: (If the conic degenerates into two straight lines, Pascal&#x27;s becomes Pappus&#x27;s theorem, which has no interesting dual, since the Brianchon point trivially becomes the two lines&#x27; intersection point.)

== Axioms of projective geometry ==
Any given geometry may be deduced from an appropriate set of axioms. Projective geometries are characterised by the &quot;elliptic parallel&quot; axiom, that &quot;any two planes always meet in just one line&quot;, or in the plane, &quot;any two lines always meet in just one point&quot;. In other words, there are no such things as parallel lines or planes in projective geometry.

Many alternative sets of axioms for projective geometry have been proposed (see for example Coxeter 2003, Hilbert &amp; Cohn-Vossen 1999, Greenberg 1980).

=== Whitehead&#x27;s axioms ===
These axioms are based on Whitehead, &quot;The Axioms of Projective Geometry&quot;. There are two types, points and lines, and one &quot;incidence&quot; relation between points and lines. The three axioms are:
* G1: Every line contains at least 3 points
* G2: Every two distinct points, A and B, lie on a unique line, AB.
* G3: If lines AB and CD intersect, then so do lines AC and BD (where it is assumed that A and D are distinct from B and C).

The reason each line is assumed to contain at least 3 points is to eliminate some degenerate cases. The spaces satisfying these
three axioms either have at most one line, or are projective spaces of some dimension over a division ring, or are non-Desarguesian planes.

=== Additional axioms ===
One can add further axioms restricting the dimension or the coordinate ring. For example, Coxeter&#x27;s &quot;Projective Geometry&quot;, references Veblen in the three axioms above, together with a further 5 axioms that make the dimension 3 and the coordinate ring a commutative field of characteristic not 2.

=== Axioms using a ternary relation ===
One can pursue axiomatization by postulating a ternary relation, [ABC] to denote when three points (not all necessarily distinct) are collinear. An axiomatization may be written down in terms of this relation as well:
* C0: [ABA]
* C1: If A and B are distinct points such that [ABC] and [ABD] then [BDC]
* C2: If A and B are distinct points then there exists a third distinct point C such that [ABC]
* C3: If A and C are distinct points, and B and D are distinct points, with [BCE] and [ADE] but not [ABE], then there is a point F such that [ACF] and [BDF].
For two distinct points, A and B, the line AB is defined as consisting of all points C for which [ABC]. The axioms C0 and C1 then provide a formalization of G2; C2 for G1 and C3 for G3.

The concept of line generalizes to planes and higher-dimensional subspaces. A subspace, AB...XY may thus be recursively defined in terms of the subspace AB...X as that containing all the points of all lines YZ, as Z ranges over AB...X. Collinearity then generalizes to the relation of &quot;independence&quot;. A set of points is independent, [AB...Z] if is a minimal generating subset for the subspace AB...Z.

The projective axioms may be supplemented by further axioms postulating limits on the dimension of the space. The minimum dimension is determined by the existence of an independent set of the required size. For the lowest dimensions, the relevant conditions may be stated in equivalent
form as follows. A projective space is of:
* (L1) at least dimension 0 if it has at least 1 point,
* (L2) at least dimension 1 if it has at least 2 distinct points (and therefore a line),
* (L3) at least dimension 2 if it has at least 3 non-collinear points (or two lines, or a line and a point not on the line),
* (L4) at least dimension 3 if it has at least 4 non-coplanar points.

The maximum dimension may also be determined in a similar fashion. For the lowest dimensions, they take on the following forms. A projective space is of:
* (M1) at most dimension 0 if it has no more than 1 point,
* (M2) at most dimension 1 if it has no more than 1 line,
* (M3) at most dimension 2 if it has no more than 1 plane,
and so on. It is a general theorem (a consequence of axiom (3)) that all coplanar lines intersect—the very principle that projective geometry was originally intended to embody. Therefore, property (M3) may be equivalently stated that all lines intersect one another.

It is generally assumed that projective spaces are of at least dimension 2. In some cases, if the focus is on projective planes, a variant of M3 may be postulated. The axioms of (Eves 1997: 111), for instance, include (1), (2), (L3) and (M3). Axiom (3) becomes vacuously true under (M3) and is therefore not needed in this context.

=== Axioms for projective planes ===

In incidence geometry, most authors give a treatment that embraces the Fano plane as the smallest finite projective plane. An axiom system that achieves this is as follows:
* (P1) Any two distinct points lie on a line that is unique.
* (P2) Any two distinct lines meet at a point that is unique.
* (P3) There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear.

Coxeter&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Geometry&quot; gives a list of five axioms for a more restrictive concept of a projective plane that is attributed to Bachmann, adding Pappus&#x27;s theorem to the list of axioms above (which eliminates non-Desarguesian planes) and excluding projective planes over fields of characteristic 2 (those that do not satisfy Fano&#x27;s axiom). The restricted planes given in this manner more closely resemble the real projective plane.

== Perspectivity and projectivity ==
Given three non-collinear points, there are three lines connecting them, but with four points, no three collinear, there are six connecting lines and three additional &quot;diagonal points&quot; determined by their intersections. The science of projective geometry captures this surplus determined by four points through a quaternary relation and the projectivities which preserve the complete quadrangle configuration.

An harmonic quadruple of points on a line occurs when there is a complete quadrangle two of whose diagonal points are in the first and third position of the quadruple, and the other two positions are points on the lines joining two quadrangle points through the third diagonal point.

A spatial perspectivity of a projective configuration in one plane yields such a configuration in another, and this applies to the configuration of the complete quadrangle. Thus harmonic quadruples are preserved by perspectivity. If one perspectivity follows another the configurations follow along. The composition of two perspectivities is no longer a perspectivity, but a projectivity.

While corresponding points of a perspectivity all converge at a point, this convergence is &quot;not&quot; true for a projectivity that is &quot;not&quot; a perspectivity. In projective geometry the intersection of lines formed by corresponding points of a projectivity in a plane are of particular interest. The set of such intersections is called a projective conic, and in acknowledgement of the work of Jakob Steiner, it is referred to as a Steiner conic.

Suppose a projectivity is formed by two perspectivities centered on points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, relating &quot;x&quot; to &quot;X&quot; by an intermediary &quot;p&quot;:
: formula_1
The projectivity is then formula_2 Then given the projectivity formula_3 the induced conic is
: formula_4

Given a conic &quot;C&quot; and a point &quot;P&quot; not on it, two distinct secant lines through &quot;P&quot; intersect &quot;C&quot; in four points. These four points determine a quadrangle of which &quot;P&quot; is a diagonal point. The line through the other two diagonal points is called the polar of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P &quot;is the pole of this line. Alternatively, the polar line of &quot;P&quot; is the set of projective harmonic conjugates of &quot;P&quot; on a variable secant line passing through &quot;P&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.

<text>Alvin Cullum York (December 13, 1887 – September 2, 1964), also known by his rank as Sergeant York, was an American soldier who was one of the most decorated United States Army soldiers of World War I. He received the Medal of Honor for leading an attack on a German machine gun nest, gathering 35 machine guns, killing at least 25 enemy soldiers and capturing 132 prisoners. York&#x27;s Medal of Honor action occurred during the United States-led portion of the Meuse–Argonne offensive in France, which was intended to breach the Hindenburg line and force the Germans to surrender. He earned decorations from several allied countries during the war, including France, Italy and Montenegro.

York was born in rural Tennessee, in what is now the community of Pall Mall in Fentress County. His parents farmed, and his father also worked as a blacksmith. The eleven York children had minimal schooling because they helped provide for the family, including hunting, fishing, and working as laborers. After the death of his father, York assisted in caring for his younger siblings and found work as a blacksmith. Despite being a regular churchgoer, York also drank heavily and was prone to fistfights. After a 1914 conversion experience, he vowed to improve and became even more devoted to the Church of Christ in Christian Union. York was drafted during World War I; he initially claimed conscientious objector status on the grounds that his religious denomination forbade violence. Persuaded that his religion was not incompatible with military service, York joined the 82nd Division as an infantry private and went to France in 1918.

In October 1918, Private First Class (Acting Corporal) York was one of a group of seventeen soldiers assigned to infiltrate German lines and silence a machine gun position. After the American patrol had captured a large group of enemy soldiers, German small arms fire killed six Americans and wounded three. Several of the Americans returned fire while others guarded the prisoners. York and the other Americans attacked the machine gun position, killing several German soldiers. The German officer responsible for the machine gun position had emptied his pistol while firing at York but failed to hit him. This officer then offered to surrender and York accepted. York and his men marched back to their unit&#x27;s command post with more than 130 prisoners. York was later promoted to sergeant and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. An investigation resulted in the upgrading of the award to the Medal of Honor. York&#x27;s feat made him a national hero and international celebrity among allied nations.

After Armistice Day, a group of Tennessee businessmen purchased a farm for York, his new wife, and their growing family. He later formed a charitable foundation to improve educational opportunities for children in rural Tennessee. In the 1930s and 1940s, York worked as a project superintendent for the Civilian Conservation Corps and managed construction of the Byrd Lake reservoir at Cumberland Mountain State Park, after which he served for several years as park superintendent. A 1941 film about his World War I exploits, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, was that year&#x27;s highest-grossing film; Gary Cooper won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of York, and the film was credited with enhancing American morale as the U.S. mobilized for action in World War II. In his later years, York was confined to bed by health problems. He died in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1964 and was buried at Wolf River Cemetery in his hometown of Pall Mall, Tennessee.

==Early life ==
Alvin Cullum York was born in a two-room log cabin in Fentress County, Tennessee. He was the third child born to William Uriah York and Mary Elizabeth (Brooks) York. William Uriah York was born in Jamestown, Tennessee, to Uriah York and Eliza Jane Livingston, who had moved to Tennessee from Buncombe County, North Carolina. Mary Elizabeth York was born in Pall Mall to William Brooks, who took his mother&#x27;s maiden name as an alias of William H. Harrington after deserting from Company A of the 11th Michigan Cavalry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Nancy Pyle, and was the great-granddaughter of Conrad &quot;Coonrod&quot; Pyle, an English settler who settled Pall Mall, Tennessee.

William York and Mary Brooks married on December 25, 1881, and had eleven children: Henry Singleton, Joseph Marion, Alvin Cullum, Samuel John, Albert, Hattie, George Alexander, James Preston, Lillian Mae, Robert Daniel, and Lucy Erma. The York family is mainly of English ancestry, with Scots-Irish ancestry as well. The family resided in the Indian Creek area of Fentress County. The family was impoverished, with William York working as a blacksmith to supplement the family&#x27;s income. The men of the York family farmed and harvested their own food, while the mother made all of the family&#x27;s clothing. The York sons attended school for only nine months and withdrew from education because William York needed them to help work on the family farm, hunt, and fish to help feed the family. When William York died in November 1911, his son Alvin helped his mother raise his younger siblings. Alvin was the oldest sibling still residing in the county, since his two older brothers had married and relocated. To supplement the family&#x27;s income, York worked in Harriman, Tennessee, first in railroad construction and then as a logger. By all accounts, he was a skilled laborer who was devoted to the welfare of his family, and a crack shot. York was also a violent alcoholic prone to fighting in saloons. In one of the saloon fights his best friend was killed. His mother, a member of a pacifist Protestant denomination, tried to persuade York to change his ways.

==World War I==

Despite his history of drinking and fighting, York attended church regularly and often led the hymn singing. A revival meeting at the end of 1914 led him to a conversion experience on January 1, 1915. His congregation was the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a Protestant denomination that shunned secular politics and disputes between Christian denominations. This church had no specific doctrine of pacifism but it had been formed in reaction to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South&#x27;s support of slavery, including armed conflict during the American Civil War, and it opposed all forms of violence. In a lecture later in life, York reported his reaction to the outbreak of World War I: &quot;I was worried clean through. I didn&#x27;t want to go and kill. I believed in my Bible.&quot;

On June 5, 1917, at the age of 29, Alvin York registered for the draft as all men between 21 and 30 years of age were required to do as a result of the Selective Service Act. When he registered for the draft, he answered the question &quot;Do you claim exemption from draft (specify grounds)?&quot; by writing &quot;Yes. Don&#x27;t Want To Fight.&quot; When his initial claim for conscientious objector status was denied, he appealed. During World War I, conscientious objector status did not exempt the objector from military duty. Such individuals could still be drafted and were given assignments that did not conflict with their anti-war principles. In November 1917, while York&#x27;s application was considered, he was drafted and began his army service at Camp Gordon, Georgia.

From the day he registered for the draft until he returned from the war on May 29, 1919, York kept a diary of his activities. In his diary, York wrote that he refused to sign documents provided by his pastor seeking a discharge from the Army on religious grounds and similar documents provided by his mother asserting a claim of exemption as the sole support of his mother and siblings. Despite his initial, signed request for an exemption, he later disclaimed ever having been a conscientious objector.

===Entry into service===
York served in Company G, 328th Infantry, 82nd Division. Deeply troubled by the conflict between his pacifism and his training for war, he spoke at length with his company commander, Captain Edward Courtney Bullock Danforth Jr. (1894–1974) of Augusta, Georgia, and his battalion commander, Major G. Edward Buxton of Providence, Rhode Island, a devout Christian himself. Biblical passages about violence (&quot;He that hath no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy one.&quot; &quot;Render unto Caesar…&quot; &quot;…if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight.&quot;) cited by Danforth persuaded York to reconsider the morality of his participation in the war. Granted a 10-day leave to visit home, he returned as committed to his new mission as he had been to pacifism, convinced that God meant him to fight and would keep him safe. He served with his division in the St. Mihiel Offensive.

===Medal of Honor action===

In an October 8, 1918, attack that occurred during the Meuse–Argonne offensive, York&#x27;s battalion aimed to capture German positions near Hill 223 () along the Decauville railroad north of Chatel-Chéhéry, France. His actions that day earned him the Medal of Honor. He later recalled:
Under the command of Cpl. (Acting Sergeant) Bernard Early, four non-commissioned officers, including Acting Corporal York, and thirteen privates were ordered to infiltrate the German lines to take out the machine guns. The group worked their way behind the Germans and overran the headquarters of a German unit, capturing a large group of German soldiers who were preparing a counter-attack against the U.S. troops. Early&#x27;s men were contending with the prisoners when German machine gun fire suddenly peppered the area, killing six Americans and wounding three others. Several of the Americans returned fire while others guarded the prisoners. From his advantageous position, York fought the Germans. York recalled:

During the assault, a German officer led several Germans to the scene of the fighting and ran into York who shot several of them with his pistol.

Imperial German Army First Lieutenant Paul Jürgen Vollmer, commanding the 120th Reserve Infantry Regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion, emptied his pistol trying to kill York while he was contending with the machine guns. Failing to injure York, and seeing his mounting losses, he offered in English to surrender the unit to York who accepted. At the end of the engagement, York and his seven men marched their German prisoners back to the American lines. Upon returning to his unit, York reported to his brigade commander, Brigadier General Julian Robert Lindsey, who remarked, &quot;Well York, I hear you have captured the whole German army.&quot; York replied, &quot;No sir. I got only 132.&quot;

York&#x27;s actions silenced the German machine guns and were responsible for enabling the 328th Infantry to renew its attack to capture the Decauville Railroad.

===Post-battle===

York was promptly promoted to sergeant and received the Distinguished Service Cross. A few months later, an investigation by York&#x27;s chain of command resulted in an upgrade of his Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor, which was presented by the commanding general of the American Expeditionary Forces, General John J. Pershing. The French Republic awarded him the , Medaille Militaire and Legion of Honor.

In addition to his French medals, Italy awarded York the Croce al Merito di Guerra and Montenegro decorated him with its War Medal. He eventually received nearly 50 decorations.
York&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation reads:

In attempting to explain his actions during the 1919 investigation that resulted in the Medal of Honor, York told General Lindsey, &quot;A higher power than man guided and watched over me and told me what to do.&quot; Lindsey replied, &quot;York, you are right.&quot;

Biographer David D. Lee (2000) wrote:
==Homecoming and fame==
Before leaving France, York was his division&#x27;s noncommissioned officer delegate to the caucus which created the American Legion, of which York was a charter member.
York&#x27;s heroism went unnoticed in the United States press, even in Tennessee, until the publication of the April 26, 1919, issue of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which had a circulation in excess of 2 million. In an article titled &quot;The Second Elder Gives Battle&quot;, journalist George Pattullo, who had learned of York&#x27;s story while touring battlefields earlier in the year, laid out the themes that have dominated York&#x27;s story ever since: the mountaineer, his religious faith and skill with firearms, patriotic, plainspoken and unsophisticated, an uneducated man who &quot;seems to do everything correctly by intuition.&quot; In response, the Tennessee Society, a group of Tennesseans living in New York City, arranged celebrations to greet York upon his return to the United States, including a 5-day furlough to allow for visits to New York City and Washington, D.C. York arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey, on May 22, stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, and attended a formal banquet in his honor. He toured the subway system in a special car before continuing to Washington, where the House of Representatives gave him a standing ovation and he met Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and the President&#x27;s secretary Joe Tumulty, as President Wilson was still in Paris.

York proceeded to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, where he was discharged from the service, and then to Tennessee for more celebrations. He had been home for barely a week when, on June 7, 1919, York and Gracie Loretta Williams were married by Tennessee Governor Albert H. Roberts in Pall Mall. More celebrations followed the wedding, including a week-long trip to Nashville where York accepted a special medal awarded by the state.

York refused many offers to profit from his fame, including thousands of dollars offered for appearances, product endorsements, newspaper articles, and movie rights to his life story. Instead, he lent his name to various charitable and civic causes. To support economic development, he campaigned for the Tennessee government to build a road to service his native region, succeeding when a highway through the mountains was completed in the mid-1920s and named Alvin C. York Highway. The Nashville Rotary organized the purchase, by public subscription, of a farm, the one gift that York accepted. However, it was not the fully equipped farm he was promised, requiring York to borrow money to stock it. He subsequently lost money in the farming depression that followed the war. Then the Rotary was unable to continue the installment payments on the property, leaving York to pay them himself. In 1921, he had no option but to seek public help, resulting in an extended discussion of his finances in the press, some of it sharply critical. Debt in itself was a trial: &quot;I could get used to most any kind of hardship, but I&#x27;m not fitted for the hardship of owing money.&quot; Only an appeal to Rotary Clubs nationwide and an account of York&#x27;s plight in the &quot;New York World&quot; brought in the required contributions by Christmas 1921.

==After the war==
In the 1920s, York formed the Alvin C. York Foundation with the mission of increasing educational opportunities in his region of Tennessee. Board members included the area&#x27;s congressman, Cordell Hull, who later became Secretary of State under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo, who was President Wilson&#x27;s son-in-law, and Tennessee Governor Albert Roberts. Plans called for a non-sectarian institution providing vocational training to be called the York Agricultural Institute. York concentrated on fund-raising, though he disappointed audiences who wanted to hear about the Argonne when he instead explained that &quot;I occupied one space in a fifty mile front. I saw so little it hardly seems worthwhile discussing it. I&#x27;m trying to forget the war in the interest of the mountain boys and girls that I grew up among.&quot; He fought first to win financial support from the state and county, then battled local leaders about the school&#x27;s location. Refusing to compromise, he resigned and developed plans for a rival York Industrial School. After a series of lawsuits he gained control of the original institution and was its president when it opened in December 1929. As the Great Depression deepened, the state government failed to provide promised funds, and York mortgaged his farm to fund bus transportation for students. Even after he was ousted as president in 1936 by political and bureaucratic rivals, he continued to donate money.
In 1935, York, sensing the end of his time with the institute, began to work as a project superintendent with the Civilian Conservation Corps overseeing the creation of Cumberland Mountain State Park&#x27;s Byrd Lake, one of the largest masonry projects the program ever undertook. York served as the park&#x27;s superintendent until 1940. In the second half of 1930s and early 1940s, in the run-up to the America&#x27;s entry in World War II, York was a forceful and public advocate for interventionism, calling for U.S. involvement in the war against Germany, Italy and Japan. At the time, U.S. public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of the isolationist and non-interventionist approach, and York&#x27;s unpopular views led to accusations that he was engaged in war-mongering. York became a relatively rare high-profile public voice for intervention. In a speech at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in May 1941, York said: &quot;We must fight again! The time is not now ripe, nor will it ever be, to compromise with Hitler, or the things he stands for.&quot;

York&#x27;s speeches attracted the attention of President Roosevelt, who frequently quoted York, particularly a passage from York&#x27;s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier speech:

During World War II, York attempted to re-enlist in the Army.
However, at fifty-four years of age, overweight, near-diabetic, and with evidence of arthritis, he was denied enlistment as a combat soldier. Instead, he was commissioned as a major in the Army Signal Corps and he toured training camps and participated in bond drives in support of the war effort, usually paying his own travel expenses. Gen. Matthew Ridgway later recalled that York &quot;created in the minds of farm boys and clerks ... the conviction that an aggressive soldier, well-trained and well-armed, can fight his way out of any situation.&quot; He also raised funds for war-related charities, including the Red Cross. He served on his county draft board and, when literacy requirements forced the rejection of large numbers of Fentress County men, he offered to lead a battalion of illiterates himself, saying they were &quot;crack shots&quot;. Although York served during the war as a Signal Corps major and as a colonel with the 7th Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard, newspapers continued to refer to him as &quot;Sergeant York&quot;.

===Legacy and film story===
Biographer David Lee explored the reason Americans responded so favorably to his story:


York cooperated with journalists in telling his life story twice in the 1920s. He allowed Nashville-born freelance journalist Sam Cowan to see his diary and submitted to interviews. The resulting 1922 biography focused on York&#x27;s Appalachian background, describing his upbringing among the &quot;purest Anglo-Saxons to be found today&quot;, emphasizing popular stereotypes without bringing the man to life. A few years later, York contacted a publisher about an edition of his war diary, but the publisher wanted additional material to flesh out the story. Then Tom Skeyhill, an Australian-born veteran of the Gallipoli campaign, visited York in Tennessee and the two became friends. On York&#x27;s behalf, Skeyhill wrote an &quot;autobiography&quot; in the first person and was credited as the editor of &quot;Sergeant York: His Own Life Story and War Diary&quot;. With a preface by Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War in World War I, it presented a one-dimensional York supplemented with tales of life in the Tennessee mountains. Reviews noted that York only promoted his life story in the interest of funding educational programs: &quot;Perhaps York&#x27;s bearing after his famous exploit in the Argonne best reveals his native greatness. ... He will not exploit himself except for his own people. All of which gives his book an appeal beyond its contents.&quot;

The mountaineer persona Cowan and Skeyhill promoted reflected York&#x27;s own beliefs. In a speech at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, he said:

For many years, York employed a secretary, Arthur S. Bushing, who wrote the lectures and speeches York delivered. Bushing prepared York&#x27;s correspondence as well. Like the works of Cowan and Skeyhill, words commonly ascribed to York, though doubtless representing his thinking, were often composed by professional writers. York had refused several times to authorize a film version of his life story. Finally, in 1940, as York was looking to finance an interdenominational Bible school, he yielded to a persistent Hollywood producer and negotiated the contract himself. In 1941 the movie &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, directed by Howard Hawks with Gary Cooper in the title role, told about his life and Medal of Honor action. The screenplay included much fictitious material, though it was based on York&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot;. The marketing of the film included a visit by York to the White House, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt praised the film. Some of the response to the film divided along political lines, with advocates of preparedness and aid to Great Britain enthusiastic (&quot;Hollywood&#x27;s first solid contribution to the national defense&quot;, said &quot;Time&quot;) and isolationists calling it &quot;propaganda&quot; for the administration. It received 11 Oscar nominations and won two, including the Academy Award for Best Actor for Cooper. It was the highest-grossing picture of 1941. York&#x27;s earnings from the film, about $150,000 in the first two years as well as later royalties, resulted in a decade-long battle with the Internal Revenue Service. York eventually built part of his planned Bible school, which hosted 100 students until the late 1950s.

===Political views===
York originally believed in the morality of America&#x27;s intervention in World War I. By the mid-1930s, he looked back more critically: &quot;I can&#x27;t see that we did any good. There&#x27;s as much trouble now as there was when we were over there. I think the slogan &#x27;A war to end war&#x27; is all wrong.&quot; He fully endorsed American preparedness, but showed sympathy for isolationism by saying that he would fight only if war came to America.

A consistent Democrat – &quot;I&#x27;m a Democrat first, last, and all the time&quot;, he said – in January 1941 he praised President Roosevelt&#x27;s support for Great Britain, and in an address at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Memorial Day of that year, he attacked isolationists and said that veterans understood that &quot;liberty and freedom are so very precious that you do not fight and win them once and stop.&quot; They are &quot;prizes awarded only to those peoples who fight to win them and then keep fighting eternally to hold them!&quot; At times he was blunt: &quot;I think any man who talks against the interests of his own country ought to be arrested and put in jail, not excepting senators and colonels.&quot; Everyone knew that the colonel in question was Charles Lindbergh.

In the late 1940s he called for toughness in dealing with the Soviet Union and did not hesitate to recommend using the atomic bomb in a first strike, stating, &quot;If they can&#x27;t find anyone else to push the button, I will.&quot; He questioned the failure of United Nations forces to use the atomic bomb in Korea. In the 1960s he criticized Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara&#x27;s plans to reduce the ranks of the National Guard and reserves, saying, &quot;Nothing would please Khrushchev better.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

York and his wife Gracie had ten children, seven sons and three daughters, most named after American historical figures: an infant son (1920, died at 4 days), Alvin Cullum Jr. (1921–1983), George Edward Buxton (1923–2018), Woodrow Wilson (1925–1998), Samuel Huston (1928–1929), Andrew Jackson (1930–2022), Betsy Ross (born 1933), Mary Alice (1935–1991), Thomas Jefferson (1938–1972), and an infant daughter (1940, died the same day).

York had health problems throughout his life. He had gallbladder surgery in the late 1920s and had pneumonia in 1942. Described in 1919 as a &quot;red-haired giant with the ruddy complexion of the outdoors&quot; and &quot;standing more than 6 feet ... and tipping the scale at more than 200 pounds&quot;, by 1945 he weighed 250 pounds and in 1948 he had a stroke. More strokes and another case of pneumonia followed, and he was confined to bed from 1954, further impaired by failing eyesight. He was hospitalized several times during his last two years. York died at the Veterans Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, on September 2, 1964, of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 76. After a funeral service in his Jamestown church, with Gen. Matthew Ridgway representing President Lyndon Johnson, York was buried at the Wolf River Cemetery in Pall Mall. His funeral sermon was delivered by Richard G. Humble, General Superintendent of the Churches of Christ in Christian Union. Humble also preached Mrs. York&#x27;s funeral sermon in 1984.

York was the recipient of the following awards:

===Controversy===
Beginning soon after York&#x27;s return to the United States at the end of the war, doubt and controversy periodically surfaced over whether the events detailed in his Medal of Honor documents had taken place as officially described, and whether other soldiers in York&#x27;s unit should also have been recognized for their heroism. Otis Merrithew (William Cutting) and Bernard Early were among those who argued against the official version. Of the 17 American soldiers who were involved in York&#x27;s Medal of Honor action, six were killed. York received the Medal of Honor, and over the years, three of the others who lived through that day&#x27;s fighting also received valor awards, including the Distinguished Service Cross for Early in 1929, and the Silver Star for Merrithew in 1965.
Considerable red tape hampered the other men&#x27;s attempts to get recognized as well as conflicts of interest by those reviewing their files. Later in life Gen. Lindsey would have a change of heart and support the other men&#x27;s claims for recognition, which were again blocked by military officials citing a 1929 cutoff date for recommendation. Historian James P. Gregory&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;Unraveling the Myth of Sgt. Alvin York&quot; and related academic lectures has brought about new scrutiny on the subject and renewed calls for the men involved other than York to be honored.

York&#x27;s record became the subject of controversy in Germany in 1928, after a Swedish journal published an article about York&#x27;s exploits which some Germans felt impugned the honor of the German armed forces. In 1929, the Reichsarchiv investigated the claims made about York&#x27;s battlefield exploits by reviewing military records and interviewing surviving German officers of the 2nd Württemberg Landwehr Division who had fought against York. The German report, which was not published at the time, concluded that &quot;York was a brave and fearless soldier&quot; and that the official U.S. Army report on York&#x27;s actions &quot;corresponds with the facts,&quot; but also found that some of the details of York&#x27;s first report from the battlefield had been &quot;grossly exaggerated.&quot; In particular, the German investigators found that York&#x27;s unit had likely captured fewer than 132 prisoners and 35 machine guns, as Germans records showed the loss of only 79 prisoners in the sector that day, and German officers reported there were less than 35 machine guns present. The German investigators shared their report with the U.S. Army, which did not take any action as the report confirmed York&#x27;s role in valorously leading assaults on German positions and did not contradict any of the specific details of York&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation.

===Discovery of &quot;lost&quot; battlefield===

In October 2006, United States Army Colonel Douglas Mastriano, head of the Sergeant York Discovery Expedition (SYDE), conducted research to locate the York battle site. Among the Mastriano expedition&#x27;s finds were 46 American rifle rounds. In addition, his research located pieces of German ammunition and weaponry. Without the official support of the French government, Mastriano excavated the site and bulldozed the area in order to build two monuments and a historic trail. Mastriano&#x27;s research has been strongly disputed by other historians who point out numerous errors in the history dissertation and subsequent book that he published on York.

Another team led by Dr. Tom Nolan, head of the Sergeant York Project and a geographer at the R.O. Fullerton Laboratory for Spatial Technology at Middle Tennessee State University, placed the site 600 meters south of the location identified by Mastriano. Nolan&#x27;s research relied on contemporary army graves registration Forms, the 82nd Division&#x27;s wartime history, and maps drawn by Colonel G. Edward Buxton Jr. and Captain Edward C. B. Danforth, both of whom walked the ground with York during the Medal of Honor investigation.

===Monuments and memorials===
Many places and monuments throughout the world have been named in honor of York:
* The Sgt. Alvin C. York State Historic Park preserves his farm in Pall Mall.
* The Alvin C. York Bridge across the Tennessee River between Perry County, Tennessee and Decatur County, Tennessee. 
* Several government buildings have been named for York, including the Alvin C. York Veterans Hospital located in Murfreesboro.
* The Alvin C. York Institute was founded in 1926 as an agricultural high school by York and residents of Fentress County and continues to serve as Jamestown&#x27;s high school.
* York Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City was named for York in 1928.
* A statue of York by sculptor Felix de Weldon was placed on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol in 1968.
* In 2007, the 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s movie theater at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was named York Theater.

York is also the namesake for awards and military assets:
* In the 1980s, the United States Army named its DIVAD weapon system &quot;Sergeant York&quot;; the project was cancelled because of technical problems and cost overruns.
* In 1993, York was among 35 Medal of Honor recipients whose portraits were painted and biographies included in a boxed set of &quot;Congressional Medal of Honor Trading Cards,&quot; issued by Eclipse Enterprises under license from the Medal of Honor Society. The text is by Kent DeLong, the paintings by Tom Simonton, and the set edited by Catherine Yronwode.
* On May 5, 2000, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;Distinguished Soldiers&quot; stamps, one of which honored York.
* The riderless horse in the 2004 funeral procession of President Ronald Reagan was named Sergeant York.
* The traveling American football trophy between UT Martin, Austin Peay, Tennessee State, and Tennessee Tech is called the Alvin C. York trophy.
* The U.S. Army ROTC&#x27;s Sergeant York Award is presented to cadets who excel in the program and devote additional time and effort to maintaining and expanding it.
* A memorial to graduates of the East Tennessee State University ROTC program who have given their lives for their country carries a quotation from York.
* The Third Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard is named for York.

Appearances and references in literature:
* Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Penn Warren used York as the model for characters in two of his novels, both explorations of the burden of fame faced by battlefield heroes in peacetime. In &quot;At Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1943), a Tennessee mountaineer who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War I returns from combat, becomes a state legislator, and then a bank president. Others exploit his decency and fame for their own selfish ends as the novel explores the real-life experience of an old-fashioned hero in a cynical world. In &quot;The Cave&quot; (1959), a similar hero from a similar background has aged and become an invalid. He struggles to maintain his identity as his real self diverges from the robust legend of his youth.
* The Association of the United States Army published a digital graphic novel about York in 2018.
* Laura Cantrell&#x27;s 2005 song &quot;Old Downtown&quot; talks about York in depth.
* Swedish power metal band Sabaton&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;The Great War&quot; contained a track titled &quot;82nd All the Way&quot; (&quot;What Sergeant York achieved that day, echoes from France to the USA, It&#x27;s 82nd all the way!&quot;), a tribute to York&#x27;s Medal of Honor action. The song is then covered by another Swedish band, Amaranthe, before both bands toured together in Europe.
* In the alternate history novel &quot;1945&quot; by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen, Alvin York is pitted against the well-known German commando Otto Skorzeny, who in the book&#x27;s plot raids York&#x27;s native Tennessee with the aim of destroying the American atomic bomb program in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. As depicted in the book, York - though no longer young - gives a very good account of himself, rallying local militias to fight the unexpected German attack.

<text>William Prescott (February 20, 1726 – October 13, 1795) was an American officer in the Revolutionary War best known for his service at the Battle of Bunker Hill. 

==Life==
Prescott was born in Groton, Massachusetts to Benjamin Prescott (1696–1738) and Abigail Oliver Prescott (1697–1765). He married Abigail Hale (1733–1821) on April 13, 1758, and they had one child, who was named William Prescott Jr. William Prescott owned a house in Pepperell, Massachusetts, on what was later named Prescott Street. The town of his youth was then little more than a frontier settlement bordering upon Hollis, New Hampshire. In fact, the presence of hostile Indians was such a threat that many locals brought arms and ammunition with them while at work in their fields.

A prosperous farmer in his adult years, Prescott first gained military experience after joining the provincial militia during King George&#x27;s War, where he served in the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg under William Pepperrell. Later, he served as a lieutenant in the Provincial troops which assisted in the removal of neutral French from Nova Scotia in 1755. After his return he married Miss Hale, as above, and was promoted to the office of captain. During the French and Indian War widened, he was acclaimed for his leadership of allied American forces in the Battle of Fort Beausejour. Offered a British Army officer&#x27;s commission for his service in that war, he refused it and returned to managing his farm.

The now-disincorporated town of Prescott, Massachusetts, was named after him. He was the father of future Massachusetts senator William Prescott Jr., who fought with him at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He was also the grandfather of eminent historian William H. Prescott, after whom Prescott, Arizona, is named.

===American Revolutionary War===
In 1774, Prescott was appointed colonel of a regiment of “minute men”, enrolled in Pepperell and several nearby communities. After hearing of the “regulars’” (British) attack on Lexington on 19 April 1775, the alarm was raised that British troops were marching on Concord. The news reached Pepperell about 10:00 am. Prescott immediately gave orders for the company in Pepperell and the company in Hollis to march to Groton and thence to the scene of action.

Arriving before the Groton Companies were ready, the Pepperell and Hollis companies, after a short halt, proceeded on their way in advance of the Groton companies. Col. Prescott hastened ahead with as many of his regiment as he could collect to Concord and thence to Cambridge but did not overtake the retreating British troops. They arrived too late to participate in the day&#x27;s battles, but they became part of the small army that laid siege to Boston afterward. He and most of his men enlisted for eight months, the period of the first enlistment.

When the American military commanders were alerted to British plans to capture undefended high ground at Dorchester Heights and Charlestown, Prescott was chosen to lead 1,200 men onto the Charlestown peninsula and erect defenses on Bunker Hill. The actual defenses were built on Breeds Hill, as it was lower and closer to the harbor. &quot;On the 16th of June, 1775, Gen. Artemas Ward, the commander-in-chief, issued an order for placing three Massachusetts regiments (Col. Prescott&#x27;s, Col. Frye&#x27;s and Col. Bridge&#x27;s) and one hundred and twenty men from a Connecticut regiment (under the brave command of Thomas Knowlton), about one thousand in all, all under the command of Col. Prescott, directing them to proceed to Bunker Hill and there erect a fortification.

The detachment started from Cambridge Common at dark, proceeding silently to Bunker Hill. There, at about 11 o&#x27;clock pm, the troops commenced building the entrenchments as laid out by Captain Richard Gridley. The breast work or redoubt was only constructed of such earth as the party had thrown up after the middle of the night and was not more than breast high to a man of medium height. Colonel Prescott being a very tall man, six feet and two or three inches in height, his head and shoulders and a considerable portion of his body must have been exposed during the whole of the engagement. He wore a three-cornered cocked hat and a ban-yan or calico coat. After one of his men was killed by cannon ball, Prescott, perceiving that this had made some of the soldiers sick at heart, mounted tile para-pet and walked leisurely around it, cheering his soldiers by approbation and humor. His clothing was repeatedly spattered with the blood and the brains of the killed and wounded. 

The next day, his troops, who were tired from working to construct a redoubt and other defensive works, and had only limited ammunition, formed the centerpiece of the American defenses when the British attacked the position. The British began firing from the ship &quot;Lively&quot; at 4 a.m. and attacked at 3 p.m.

Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank, where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork, and topped it with fence rails and hay. They also constructed three small v-shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott&#x27;s breastwork. Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed.

In spirited battle, Prescott&#x27;s men twice threw back British assaults on the redoubt. When the British made a third attempt, his men were almost out of ammunition; after an initial volley, he ordered a retreat from the redoubt. He was one of the last men to leave the redoubt, parrying bayonet thrusts with his ceremonial saber. The men on the left flank played a key part in the cover of the retreat.

Dr. O. Prescott Jr. saw the waistcoat and the ban-yan coat after the engagement, and they had several holes pierced by the bayonets of the British in their attempts at his life.” The Americans, although raw troops, fought with the bravery and obstinacy of veterans, until their ammunition was exhausted. Col. Prescott was always confident that he could have maintained his position, even with the handful of men under him, if he had been supplied with ammunition.

Prescott told General Artemas Ward, the Commander-in-Chief, that he would retake the place that night or perish in the attempt, if Ward would give him three regiments, with bayonets and sufficient ammunition. But from prudential reasons it was declined. While the British successfully captured Bunker Hill, the poorly organized colonial forces inflicted significant casualties. The British were unable to capitalize their victory and lost 50 percent (killed or wounded) of the force commanded by General Howe.

Prescott is widely seen as having played a key role in the battle, keeping the relatively poorly trained militia under his command well-disciplined. As it was, however, the British were left in possession of the field, for they had carried the position at the point of the bayonet and technically the day was theirs.

Among the many Americans who distinguished themselves at Bunker Hill the names of Prescott, Putnam and Warren stand out most clearly. While General Putnam was on the scene at Bunker Hill by some writers he was not in the redoubt at Breeds Hill at any time during the action, but was attempting to direct affairs, to unit commanders who often misunderstood or disobeyed orders from that position. Joseph Warren, a Massachusetts politician and member of the colony&#x27;s Committee of safety (American Revolution), volunteered to serve under Colonel William Prescott in the defense of the redoubt as a private and wanted to be close to the battle. It is during the retreat from the redoubt on Breeds Hill that Joseph Warren was killed.

When the Second Continental Congress established the Continental Army it sent George Washington to take command of the forces besieging Boston. Prescott received a colonel&#x27;s commission, and his unit became the 7th Continental Regiment. The regiment saw service in the 1776 defense of New York.

While Prescott appears to have given up command of the regiment after that campaign, he apparently participated in some capacity in the 1777 Saratoga campaign, for he is depicted in the painting of the &quot;Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga&quot; by John Trumbull,
which hangs in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.

In his person he was tall, with a large and muscular frame, but not corpulent, his features strong and indicative of intelligence. He was courteous and benevolent, and possessed a strong mind. Not having had the advantages of an early education he was most emphatically a self-made man. His departure from military service may have been due to injuries sustained in an accident on his farm.

===Later life===
Col. Prescott continued in the service until the end of 1776. He was stationed at Governor&#x27;s Island, N. Y., until the Americans were obliged to retire from the city. In the autumn of 1777, he went as a volunteer, to assist in the capture of the army under General Burgoyne, which was his last military service. He was elected a member of the Provincial Congress held at Salem. After his retirement from the army he served the town as town clerk, selectman, representative to the General Court for three years, and was an acting magistrate for the remainder of his life. When Shays&#x27; Rebellion broke out, he hastened to Concord, and assisted in protecting the courts of justice and of preserving law and order. Prescott served in the Massachusetts General Court in later years. He also served in the militia called out in 1786 to suppress Shays&#x27; Rebellion. His brother Oliver Prescott was said to be influential in the suppression of that outbreak.

The following anecdote the writer had from Colonel Prescott himself: &quot;While stationed with his regiment near New York in 1776, the out guards brought in a British deserter. As they approached the camp the deserter observed to the guards, &#x27;That officer yonder is Colonel Prescott.&#x27; The guard informed the Colonel of the fact. &#x27;How come you to know me?&#x27; inquired Colonel Prescott. &#x27;I saw you on Bunker Hill,&#x27; replied the soldier, &#x27;and recollected you immediately.&#x27; &#x27;Why did you not kill me at that time?&#x27; asked Colonel Prescott. &#x27;I tried my best,&#x27; said the soldier, &#x27;I took deliberate aim at you more than once when I thought it impossible for you to escape. I also palsied at you several times with my bayonet when you were as near as I could have wished, and after several of us had taken possession of your works.&#x27; &#x27;You are a brave fellow,&#x27; said Colonel Prescott, &#x27;come into my tent and I will treat you.&#x27;&quot; While on the retreat from the scene of conflict Colonel Prescott came to a house on Charlestown street, near the Boston Neck, where were three or four men who had just prepared a bowl of punch, and which they presented to Colonel Prescott before having tasted it. This, to a man suffering with fatigue and parched with thirst, was a most gratifying and acceptable offering. Prescott took the bowl, but before he had time to partake of its contents a cannon ball passed through the house, upon which the men immediately fled, leaving Colonel Prescott to drain the bowl by himself and at his leisure. Dr. O. Prescott further relates that Colonel Prescott was a true patriot. As a neighbor, kind and benevolent, and a peacemaker in to his vain, and was universally loved and respected. William died of dropsy of the chest, in Pepperell and was buried with military honors suitable to his rank, life and character at Walton Cemetery. He fell at a ripe old age, full of honors, and highly esteemed and respected. His widow died October 21, 1821, aged 88 years.

===Opposition to Slavery===
William Prescott never owned slaves, and spoke out against the practice of slavery. Prescott advocated that Massachusetts outlaw slavery. When Massachusetts did abolish slavery in 1783, Prescott celebrated publicly. Prescott was also outspoken about his praise for African-American soldier Salem Poor who fought with Prescott at Bunker Hill, going so far as to sign a letter to the court of Massachusetts praising his conduct in battle and advocating that he be rewarded for it.

==Legacy==

Prescott&#x27;s likeness was made into a statue for a memorial for the Battle of Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Massachusetts and was dedicated in 1881.

The former town of Prescott, Massachusetts, was named in his honor. The town was disincorporated in 1938 as part of the building of the Quabbin Reservoir, and the land now makes up Prescott Peninsula, which divides the main branches of the reservoir.

Colonel Prescott&#x27;s famous order, &quot;Do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes,&quot; is a significant part of the Schoolhouse Rock video and song, &quot;The Shot Heard round the World.&quot;

In 1856, the Prescott School, named in his honor, was built on the northeasterly portion of the Bunker Hill Burying Ground in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The Prescott School later merged with the Warren School to form the Warren-Prescott School.

Prescott&#x27;s house is located in Pepperell, Massachusetts.

Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a small granite monument to the place where, on the night of June 16, 1775, 1,200 Patriot men assembled and were addressed by Prescott and Harvard President Langdon, before their march to Bunker and Breed&#x27;s Hills. See citation for picture of its inscription, which erroneously calls him a general. This monument is located on the lawn west of Harvard&#x27;s Littauer Center, itself west of Harvard&#x27;s Science Center, just outside Harvard Yard. See citation for location map.

However, Prescott Street, two blocks from Harvard Yard in Cambridge is &quot;not&quot; named after Colonel William Prescott, but after his grandson, William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796 – January 28, 1859). This grandson became a noted historian and author, who (in a remarkable moment of historical reconciliation) married the granddaughter of Captain John Linzee, captain of HMS &quot;Falcon&quot;, one of the British ships that fired on Bunker Hill Patriots. The city of Prescott, Arizona, is also named in honor of the scholarly grandson.

William Prescott Elementary School, in Scranton, PA, is named in his honor. Built in 1966, their mascot is the Patriots.

<text>The Tibetan script is a segmental writing system, or &quot;abugida&quot;, forming a part of the Brahmic scripts, and used to write certain Tibetic languages, including Tibetan, Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, Jirel and Balti. It was originally developed in by Tibetan minister Thonmi Sambhota for King Songtsen Gampo.

The printed form is called uchen script while the hand-written form used in everyday writing is called umê script. This writing system is especially used across the Himalayan Region.

==History==
According to Tibetan historiography, the Tibetan script was developed during the reign of King Songtsen Gampo by his minister Thonmi Sambhota, who was sent to India along with other scholars to study Buddhism along with Sanskrit and other brahmi languages. They developed the Tibetan script from the Gupta script while at the Pabonka Hermitage.

This occurred , towards the beginning of Songtsen Gampo&#x27;s reign. There were 21 Sutra texts held by the King which were translated afterwards. In the first half of the 7th century, the Tibetan script was used for the codification of these sacred Buddhist texts, for written civil laws, and for a Tibetan Constitution.

A contemporary academic suggests that the script was instead developed in the second half of the 11th century. New research and writings also suggest that there were one or more Tibetan scripts in use prior to the introduction of the script by Songtsen Gampo and Thonmi Sambhota. The incomplete Dunhuang manuscripts are their key evidence for their hypothesis, while the few discovered and recorded Old Tibetan Annals manuscripts date from 650 and therefore post-date the c. 620 date of development of the original Tibetan script.

Three orthographic standardisations were developed. The most important, an official orthography aimed to facilitate the translation of Buddhist scriptures emerged during the early 9th century. Standard orthography has not been altered since then, while the spoken language has changed by, for example, losing complex consonant clusters. As a result, in all modern Tibetan dialects and in particular in the Standard Tibetan of Lhasa, there is a great divergence between current spelling, which still reflects the 9th-century spoken Tibetan, and current pronunciation. This divergence is the basis of an argument in favour of spelling reform, to write Tibetan &quot;as it is pronounced&quot;; for example, writing &quot;Kagyu&quot; instead of &quot;Bka&#x27;-rgyud&quot;.

The nomadic Amdo Tibetan and the western dialects of the Ladakhi language, as well as the Balti language, come close to the Old Tibetan spellings. Despite that, the grammar of these dialectical varieties has considerably changed. To write the modern varieties according to the orthography and grammar of Classical Tibetan would be similar to writing Sanskrit orthography. However, modern Buddhist practitioners in the Indian subcontinent state that the classical orthography should not be altered even when used for lay purposes. This became an obstacle for many modern Tibetic languages wishing to modernize or introduce a new spelling reform of Tibetan. 

==Description==

=== Basic alphabet ===
In the Tibetan script, the syllables are written from left to right. Syllables are separated by a &quot;tsek&quot; (་); since many Tibetan words are monosyllabic, this mark often functions almost as a space. Spaces are not used to divide words.

The Tibetan alphabet has thirty letters, sometimes known as &quot;radicals&quot;, for consonants. As in other Indic scripts, each consonant letter assumes an inherent vowel; in the Tibetan script it is /a/. The letter is also the base for dependent vowel marks.

Although some Tibetan dialects are tonal, the language had no tone at the time of the script&#x27;s invention, and there are no dedicated symbols for tone. However, since tones developed from segmental features, they can usually be correctly predicted by the archaic spelling of Tibetan words.


===Consonant clusters===

One aspect of the Tibetan script is that the consonants can be written either as radicals or they can be written in other forms, such as subscript and superscript forming consonant clusters.

To understand how this works, one can look at the radical /ka/ and see what happens when it becomes /kra/ or /rka/ (pronounced /ka/). In both cases, the symbol for /ka/ is used, but when the /ra/ is in the middle of the consonant and vowel, it is added as a subscript. On the other hand, when the /ra/ comes before the consonant and vowel, it is added as a superscript. /ra/ actually changes form when it is above most other consonants, thus rka. However, an exception to this is the cluster /ɲa/. Similarly, the consonants /ra/, and /ja/ change form when they are beneath other consonants, thus /ʈ ~ ʈʂa/; /ca/.

Besides being written as subscripts and superscripts, some consonants can also be placed in prescript, postscript, or post-postscript positions. For instance, the consonants /kʰa/, /tʰa/, /pʰa/, /ma/ and /a/ can be used in the prescript position to the left of other radicals, while the position after a radical (the postscript position), can be held by the ten consonants /kʰa/, /na/, /pʰa/, /tʰa/, /ma/, /a/, /ra/, /ŋa/, /sa/, and /la/. The third position, the post-postscript position is solely for the consonants /tʰa/ and /sa/.

====Head letters====
The head ( in Tibetan, Wylie: &quot;mgo&quot;) letter, or superscript, position above a radical is reserved for the consonants /ra/, /la/, and /sa/.

*When /ra/, /la/, and /sa/ are in superscript position with /ka/, /t͡ʃa/, /ta/, /pa/ and /t͡sa/, there are no changes to their sounds in Lhasa Tibetan, for example:
** /ka/, /ta/, /pa/, /t͡sa/
** /ka/, /t͡ʃa/, /ta/, /pa/, 
** /ka/, /ta/, /pa/, /t͡sa/
*When /ra/, /la/, and /sa/ are in superscript position with /kʰa/, /t͡ʃʰa/, /tʰa/, /pʰa/ and /t͡sʰa/, they lose their aspiration and become voiced in Lhasa Tibetan, for example:
** /ga/, /d͡ʒa/, /da/, /ba/, /dza/
** /ga/, /d͡ʒa/, /da/, /ba/, 
** /ga/, /da/, /ba/
*When /ra/, /la/, and /sa/ are in superscript position with the nasal consonants /ŋa/, /ɲya/, /na/ and /ma/, they receive a high tone in Lhasa Tibetan, for example:
** /ŋa/, /ɲa/, /na/, /ma/
** /ŋa/
** /ŋa/, /ɲa/, /na/, /ma/
*When /la/ is in superscript position with /ha/, it becomes a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant in Lhasa Tibetan:
** /l̥a/,

====Sub-joined letters====
The subscript position under a radical can only be occupied by the consonants /ja/, /ra/, /la/, and /wa/. In this position they are described as (Wylie: &quot;btags&quot;, IPA: /taʔ/), in Tibetan meaning &quot;hung on/affixed/appended&quot;, for example (IPA: /pʰa.ja.taʔ.t͡ʃʰa/), except for , which is simply read as it usually is and has no effect on the pronunciation of the consonant to which it is subjoined, for example (IPA: /ka.wa.suː.ka/).

===Vowel marks===

The vowels used in the alphabet are /a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/. While the vowel /a/ is included in each consonant, the other vowels are indicated by marks; thus /ka/, /ki/, /ku/, /ke/, /ko/. The vowels /i/, /e/, and /o/ are placed above consonants as diacritics, while the vowel /u/ is placed underneath consonants. Old Tibetan included a reversed form of the mark for /i/, the gigu &#x27;verso&#x27;, of uncertain meaning. There is no distinction between long and short vowels in written Tibetan, except in loanwords, especially transcribed from the Sanskrit.

===Numerical digits===


===Punctuation marks===

==Extended use==

The Tibetan alphabet, when used to write other languages such as Balti, Chinese and Sanskrit, often has additional and/or modified graphemes taken from the basic Tibetan alphabet to represent different sounds.

===Extended alphabet===

*In Balti, consonants ka, ra are represented by reversing the letters (ka, ra) to give (qa, ɽa).
*The Sanskrit retroflex consonants ṭa, ṭha, ḍa, ṇa, ṣa are represented in Tibetan by the letters (ta, tha, da, na, sha)
*It is a classical rule to transliterate Sanskrit ca, cha, ja, jha, to Tibetan (tsa, tsha, dza, dzha), respectively. Nowadays, (ca, cha, ja, jha) can also be used.

===Extended vowel marks and modifiers===

=== Consonant clusters ===
In addition to the use of supplementary graphemes, the rules for constructing consonant clusters are amended, allowing any character to occupy the superscript or subscript position, negating the need for the prescript and postscript positions.

== Romanization and transliteration ==

Romanization and transliteration of the Tibetan script is the representation of the Tibetan script in the Latin script. Multiple Romanization and transliteration systems have been created in recent years, but do not fully represent the true phonetic sound. While the Wylie transliteration system is widely used to Romanize Standard Tibetan, others include the Library of Congress system and the IPA-based transliteration (Jacques 2012).

Below is a table with Tibetan letters and different Romanization and transliteration system for each letter, listed below systems are: Wylie transliteration (W), Tibetan pinyin (TP), Dzongkha phonetic (DP), ALA-LC Romanization (A) and THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription (THL).

==Input method and keyboard layout==
===Tibetan===

The first version of Microsoft Windows to support the Tibetan keyboard layout is MS Windows Vista. The layout has been available in Linux since September 2007. In Ubuntu 12.04, one can install Tibetan language support through Dash / Language Support / Install/Remove Languages, the input method can be turned on from Dash / Keyboard Layout, adding Tibetan keyboard layout. The layout applies the similar layout as in Microsoft Windows.

Mac OS-X introduced Tibetan Unicode support with OS-X version 10.5 and later, now with three different keyboard layouts available: Tibetan-Wylie, Tibetan QWERTY and Tibetan-Otani.

===Dzongkha===
The Dzongkha keyboard layout scheme is designed as a simple means for inputting Dzongkha text on computers. This keyboard layout was standardized by the Dzongkha Development Commission (DDC) and the Department of Information Technology (DIT) of the Royal Government of Bhutan in 2000.

It was updated in 2009 to accommodate additional characters added to the Unicode &amp; ISO 10646 standards since the initial version. Since the arrangement of keys essentially follows the usual order of the Dzongka and Tibetan alphabet, the layout can be quickly learned by anyone familiar with this alphabet. Subjoined (combining) consonants are entered using the Shift key.

The Dzongka keyboard layout is included in Microsoft Windows, Android, and most distributions of Linux as part of XFree86.

==Unicode==

Tibetan was originally one of the scripts in the first version of the Unicode Standard in 1991, in the Unicode block U+1000–U+104F. However, in 1993, in version 1.1, it was removed (the code points it took up would later be used for the Burmese script in version 3.0). The Tibetan script was re-added in July, 1996 with the release of version 2.0.

The Unicode block for Tibetan is U+0F00–U+0FFF. It includes letters, digits and various punctuation marks and special symbols used in religious texts:

<text>There are several hundred languages in China. The predominant language is Standard Chinese, which is based on Beijingese, but there are hundreds of related Chinese languages, collectively known as &quot;Hanyu&quot; (, &#x27;Han language&#x27;), that are spoken by 92% of the population. The Chinese (or &#x27;Sinitic&#x27;) languages are typically divided into seven major language groups, and their study is a distinct academic discipline. They differ as much from each other morphologically and phonetically as do English, German and Danish, but meanwhile share the same writing system (Hanzi) and are mutually intelligible in written form. There are in addition approximately 300 minority languages spoken by the remaining 8% of the population of China. The ones with greatest state support are Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang.

According to the 2010 edition of &quot;Nationalencyklopedin&quot;, 955 million out of China&#x27;s then-population of 1.34 billion spoke some variety of Mandarin Chinese as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country&#x27;s population. According to the 2019 edition of &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, 904 million people in China spoke some variety of Mandarin as their first language in 2017.

Standard Chinese, known in China as &quot;Putonghua&quot;, based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing, is the official national spoken language for the mainland and serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking regions (and, to a lesser extent, across the other regions of mainland China). Several other autonomous regions have additional official languages. For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region and Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia. Language laws of China do not apply to either Hong Kong or Macau, which have different official languages (Cantonese, English and Portuguese) from the mainland.

==Spoken languages==
The spoken languages of nationalities that are a part of China belong to at least nine families:

* The Sino-Tibetan family: 19 official ethnicities (including the Han and Tibetans)
* The Tai–Kadai family: several languages spoken by the Zhuang, the Bouyei, the Dai, the Dong, and the Hlai (Li people); 9 official ethnicities.
* The Hmong–Mien family: 3 official ethnicities
* The Austroasiatic family: 4 official ethnicities (De&#x27;ang, Blang, Gin (Vietnamese), and Wa)
* The Turkic family: Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Salars, etc.; 7 official ethnicities.
* The Mongolic family: Mongols, Dongxiang, and related groups; 6 official ethnicities.
* The Tungusic family: Manchus (formerly), Hezhe, etc.; 5 official ethnicities.
* The Koreanic family: Korean
* The Indo-European family: 2 official ethnicities, the Russians and Tajiks (actually Pamiri people). There is also a heavily Persian-influenced Äynu language spoken by the Äynu people in southwestern Xinjiang, who are officially considered Uyghurs.
* The Austronesian family: 1 official ethnicity (the Gaoshan, who speak many languages of the Formosan branch), 1 unofficial (the Utsuls, who speak the Tsat language but are considered Hui.)

The following languages traditionally had written forms that do not involve Chinese characters (&quot;hanzi&quot;):
* The Dai people
** Tai Lü language – Tai Lü alphabet
** Tai Nüa language – Tai Nüa alphabet
* The Daur people – Daur language – Manchu alphabet
* The Hmong people – Hmongic languages – Hmong writing (Pollard script, Pahawh Hmong, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, etc.)
* The Kazakhs – Kazakh language – Kazakh alphabets
* The Koreans – Korean language – Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl alphabet

Many modern forms of spoken Chinese languages have their own distinct writing system using Chinese characters that contain colloquial variants.
These typically are used as sound characters to help determine the pronunciation of the sentence within that language:
* Written Sichuanese – Sichuanese
* Written Cantonese – Cantonese
* Written Shanghainese – Shanghainese
* Written Hakka – Hakka
* Written Hokkien – Hokkien
* Written Teochew – Teochew

Some non-Sinitic peoples have historically used Chinese characters:
* The Koreans – Korean language – Hanja
* The Vietnamese – Vietnamese language – Chữ nôm
* The Zhuang (Tai people) – Zhuang languages – Sawndip
* The Bouyei people – Bouyei language – Bouyei writing ()
* The Bai people – Bai language – Bai writing ()
* The Dong people – Dong language (China) – Dong writing ()

Other languages, all now extinct, used separate logographic scripts influenced by, but not directly derived from, Chinese characters:
* The Jurchens (Manchu ancestors) – Jurchen language – Jurchen script
* The Khitans (Mongolic people) – Khitan language – Khitan large and small scripts
* The Tanguts (Sino-Tibetan people) – Tangut language – Tangut script

During Qing dynasty, palaces, temples, and coins have sometimes been inscribed in five scripts:
* Chinese
* Manchu
* Mongol
* Tibetan
* Chagatai

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the official writing system was:
* &#x27;Phags-pa script
Chinese banknotes contain several scripts in addition to Chinese script. These are:
* Mongol
* Tibetan
* Arabic (for Uyghur)
* Latin (for Zhuang)

Other writing system for Chinese languages in China include:
* Nüshu script

Ten nationalities who never had a written system have, under the PRC&#x27;s encouragement, developed phonetic alphabets. According to a government white paper published in early 2005, &quot;by the end of 2003, 22 ethnic minorities in China used 28 written languages.&quot;

==Language policy==

One decade before the demise of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Mandarin was promoted in the planning for China&#x27;s first public school system.

Mandarin has been promoted as the commonly spoken language for the country since 1956, based phonologically on the dialect of Beijing. The North Chinese language group is set up as the standard grammatically and lexically. Meanwhile, Mao Zedong and Lu Xun writings are used as the basis of the stylistic standard. Pronunciation is taught with the use of the romanized phonetic system known as &quot;pinyin&quot;. Pinyin has been criticized for fear of an eventual replacement of the traditional character orthography.

The Chinese language policy in mainland China is heavily influenced by the Soviet nationalities policy and officially encourages the development of standard spoken and written languages for each of the nationalities of China. Language is one of the features used for ethnic identification. In September 1951, the &quot;All-China Minorities Education Conference&quot; established that all minorities should be taught in their language at the primary and secondary levels when they count with a writing language. Those without a writing language or with an &quot;imperfect&quot; writing language should be helped to develop and reform their writing languages.

However, in this schema, Han Chinese are considered a single nationality and the official policy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) treats the different varieties of Chinese differently from the different national languages, even though their differences are as significant, if not more so, as those between the various Romance languages of Europe.
While official policies in mainland China encourage the development and use of different orthographies for the national languages and their use in educational and academic settings, realistically speaking it would seem that, as elsewhere in the world, the outlook for
minority languages perceived as inferior is grim.
The Tibetan Government-in-Exile argue that social pressures and political efforts result in a policy of sinicization and feels that Beijing should promote the Tibetan language more.
Because many languages exist in China, they also have problems regarding diglossia. Recently, in terms of Fishman&#x27;s typology of the relationships between bilingualism and diglossia and his taxonomy of diglossia (Fishman 1978, 1980) in China: more and more minority communities have been evolving from &quot;diglossia without bilingualism&quot; to &quot;bilingualism without diglossia.&quot; This could be an implication of mainland China&#x27;s power expanding.

In 2010, Tibetan students protested against changes in the Language Policy on the schools that promoted the use of Mandarin Chinese instead of Tibetan. They argued that the measure would erode their culture. In 2013, China&#x27;s Education Ministry said that about 400 million people were unable to speak the national language Mandarin. In that year, the government pushed linguistic unity in China, focusing on the countryside and areas with ethnic minorities.

Mandarin Chinese is the prestige language in practice, and failure to protect ethnic languages does occur. In summer 2020, the Inner Mongolian government announced an education policy change to phase out Mongolian as the language of instructions for humanities in elementary and middle schools, adopting the national instruction material instead. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy. The Ministry of Education describes the move as a natural extension of the &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language&quot; () of 2000.

In 2024, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping called for wider use of Mandarin by ethnic minorities and in border areas. He stated, that it is necessary to guide all ethnic groups in border regions to &quot;continuously enhance their recognition of the Chinese nation, Chinese culture and the Communist Party&quot;.

==Study of foreign languages==
English has been the most widely-taught foreign language in China, as it is a required subject for students attending university. Other languages that have gained some degree of prevalence or interest are Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism.

In the late 1960s, English replaced the position of Russian to become the most studied foreign language in China. After the Reform and Opening-up policy in 1988, English was taught in public schools starting in the third year of primary school.

Russian, French, and German language classes have been made widely available in universities and colleges. In Northeast China, there are many bilingual schools (Mandarin-Japanese; Mandarin-Korean; Mandarin-Russian), in these schools, students learn languages other than English.

&quot;The Economist&quot; reported in 2006 that up to one fifth of the population was learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China would outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades.

There have been a growing number of students studying Arabic, due to reasons of cultural interest and belief in better job opportunities. The language is also widely studied amongst the Hui people. In the past, literary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China.

There have also been a growing number of students choosing to learn Urdu, due to interest in Pakistani culture, close ties between the respective nations, and job opportunities provided by the CPEC.

Interest in Portuguese and Spanish have increased greatly, due in part to Chinese investment in Latin America as well as in African nations such as Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. Portuguese is also one of the official languages in Macau, although its use had stagnated since the nation&#x27;s transfer from Portugal to the PRC. It was estimated in 2016 that 2.3% of Macau&#x27;s locals spoke the language, although with government backing since then, interest in it has increased. Macau is used by China as a hub for learning Portuguese and diplomatic and financial ties with Brazil and Portuguese-speaking African countries.

Esperanto became prominent in certain circles in the early 20th century and reached its peak in the 1980s, though by 2024 its prominence had declined.

===Use of English===

<doc id="243877" wikidata="Q333577" url="?curid=243877" title="Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon">
<text>Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon (28 November 1661 – 31 March 1723), styled Viscount Cornbury between 1674 and 1709, was an English Army officer, politician and colonial administrator. He was propelled into the forefront of English politics when he and part of his army defected from the Catholic King James II to support the newly arrived Protestant contender, William III of Orange. These actions were part of the beginning of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Cornbury&#x27;s choice to support his cousin Anne instead of William after the rebellion cost him his military commission. However, Cornbury&#x27;s support of King William&#x27;s reign eventually earned him the governorship of the provinces of New York and New Jersey; he served between 1701 and 1708.

As a High Tory governor, his primary mission was to protect the colonies during the War of the Spanish Succession (known in the Americas as Queen Anne&#x27;s War, or the 2nd French and Indian War; 1701–1714). His administration successfully prevented French incursions into the middle colonies. However, he became mired in the region&#x27;s many factional conflicts and accrued powerful political enemies such as Lewis Morris, who would go on to become Governor of New Jersey in 1738.

By 1708, war-weariness led to a shift in the political tide in Great Britain. Governor Cornbury was recalled from the colonies but was soon after installed as a member of Queen Anne&#x27;s privy council. Lord Cornbury&#x27;s fortunes changed again when George I was crowned King of Great Britain on 1 August 1714. Out of favour, Lord Cornbury died in Chelsea, London on 31 March 1723. Lord Cornbury&#x27;s conduct as governor has been generally remembered as scandalous. He was accused by his political enemies of being a cross-dresser, a moral profligate, and wildly corrupt. Few contemporary accounts exist of his conduct. Modern writers disagree whether Cornbury was a cross-dresser or the reports were an invention of his enemies.

==Early life==
The Honourable Edward Hyde, was born the only child of Henry, Viscount Cornbury &amp; 2nd Earl of Clarendon (1638–1709) and Theodosia Capell (1640–1662), daughter of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and sister of Arthur Capell. Henry and Theodosia gave birth to Edward eleven months into their marriage. Only three months after Edward&#x27;s birth, in March 1662, his mother Theodosia died of smallpox.

The Hyde family had close ties to the monarchy: Edward&#x27;s grandfather, also named Edward, was the 1st Earl of Clarendon (1609–1674). He was born a commoner but became an important advisor to King Charles I (after 1641) and to Charles II (after 1651). He was best known for negotiating the Restoration of the English Monarchy in 1660 through a series of provisions known as the Clarendon Code. The same year Charles II regained the throne, Clarendon&#x27;s daughter, Anne Hyde (1637–1671), married the new king&#x27;s younger brother &amp; heir, James, Duke of York. Meanwhile, Clarendon&#x27;s eldest son, Henry, married into the Capells of Hadham, one of the richest families in England. Edward&#x27;s aunt Anne, Duchess of York was the mother of two English Queens, Mary II and Anne.

At age 13, Edward matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 23 January 1675. Only a year earlier he had inherited the title Viscount Cornbury when his father succeeded as 2nd Earl of Clarendon. Oxford was followed by three years at l&#x27;Academie de Calvin in Geneva.

==Military service==
After graduation, Lord Cornbury joined the elite Royal Regiment of Dragoons under the command of John Churchill, the future Duke of Marlborough. He became lieutenant colonel in 1683. He was stationed in Vienna by the beginning of 1685, protecting the city from the Ottoman Empire. Cornbury first rose to prominence later that year, due to a struggle for the throne set in motion by King Charles II&#x27;s death on 6 February 1685. James II was the legitimate heir, but he was a staunch Catholic. His nephew, James Fitzroy, the Duke of Monmouth, was illegitimate but a Protestant. On 11 June 1685, Monmouth landed in England hoping to gather popular support for his claim to the throne, triggering the Monmouth Rebellion.

In response, King James II appointed John Churchill as second in command of the Royalist armies, while Lord Cornbury was promoted to command the Royal Dragoons. The rebellion was quickly crushed, with the Royal Dragoons playing a prominent role. As a reward for his service, Cornbury was given a seat in the Loyal Parliament of 1685. He continued to distinguish himself, and was a member of parliament for Wiltshire until 1695, and for Christchurch from 1695 until 1701. He earnt the role of Master of the Horse to the King of Denmark in 1685.

===Glorious Revolution===

Cornbury played a crucial role in the Glorious Rebellion, becoming the first English officer to defect to the invading William III of Orange. The rebellion originated on 18 June 1688, when prominent English nobles (the &quot;Immortal Seven&quot;) sent a letter to William III of Orange requesting his intervention in English politics on the Protestant side. In response, William arrived in Brixham, in southwest England on 5 November with over 450 ships, 15,000–18,000 men, and 3,660 cavalry.

Cornbury&#x27;s Dragoons was the first royalist unit to make contact with the invasion force – without engaging. A small skirmish was fought at Sherborne on 20 November, but shortly thereafter Lord Cornbury defected to William&#x27;s side, bringing many of his dragoons with him. Four days later on 24 November Cornbury&#x27;s mentor, Lord Churchill, also switched sides. Though a relatively small number of Cornbury&#x27;s men defected with him, accounts range from a low of 27 to a high of 100, the effect of Cornbury and Churchill&#x27;s actions were devastating to Loyalist morale, and rumours spread that the entirety of their regiments had defected with them. His father despaired at hearing his son was a rebel, but would eventually help negotiate between James and William.

By late December James had disbanded his army and fled to France. With James gone, Parliament debated whether William would rule as King in his own right, or as Queen Mary&#x27;s consort. Lord Cornbury argued for placing his cousin Anne next in succession after Mary, bypassing William. In the end, Parliament favoured William, who viewed Cornbury&#x27;s support of Anne as disloyal, and reneged on his battlefield vow that he would never forget Cornbury&#x27;s service. He punished Cornbury by dismissing him from his regiment on 17 July 1689, and from his ceremonial post as Master of Horse in May 1690.

===Post Revolution===
Cornbury now found himself and his family without income and in increasing debt. As a noble, he could not simply get a job, he would need to find income through royal or political means. He struggled to get by from 1690 through 1698. However, he continued to represent parliament, and his political support of William paid off in multiple ways. In 1698, William agreed to pay £10 a week (equal to £ today) to Cornbury, easing his financial burdens. In the spring of 1701, William rewarded Cornbury&#x27;s continued support and service and appointed Cornbury as Governor of New York.

William died before Cornbury become governor, and the crown went to Queen Mary II&#x27;s younger sister, Anne. Cornbury&#x27;s support of her for the throne in the Glorious Revolution, combined with being her first cousin, served Cornbury well. Anne continued to support Cornbury, and would reward him generously on his return from the governorship.

==Governor of New York and New Jersey==

Lord Cornbury arrived in New York on 3 May 1702, to begin his governorship and was graciously welcomed by the local aristocracy. Hyde assumed the governorship amidst Queen Anne&#x27;s War, which threatened the colonies. When Lord Cornbury was appointed governor, he was also made &quot;captain-general of all forces by sea and land&quot; for all colonies north of Virginia. Upon arrival, the new governor inspected the colony&#x27;s ring of defensive forts and found them in total disrepair, with the key defensive fort at Albany essentially unusable. In August 1703, the newly formed Province of New Jersey was added to Cornbury&#x27;s responsibilities by Queen Anne.

The governor immediately dismissed Colonel Wolfgang William Römer, the imperial engineer who had responsibility for maintaining the forts. He then assumed direct oversight over a vast project to construct a large fortress ringed with stone ramparts (later named Fort Frederick). In August 1702, Governor Cornbury toured the site with representatives of the Iroquois Five Nations. In a report to the Lords of Trade dated 18 June 1703, Imperial Inspector Colonel Robert Quary reported on the construction of the forts:

Invasion by sea was the other threat to New York. The approaches to New York harbour were fortified by a rebuilt Fort William Henry on the tip of Manhattan Island, in addition to a line of forts and stockades on both banks of the Hudson River as far as the East River. A breastwork with cannon lined the island&#x27;s riverbanks. Some of the cannon had been commandeered from ships in the harbour. Fears of attack from the sea were realised on 26 July 1706, when the French 16-gun brig &quot;Queen Anne&quot; suddenly appeared off Sandy Hook at the harbour entrance. Rumours quickly spread that 10 more ships were on the way from the Virginia Capes.

The resulting panic was magnified by the fact that fortifications at the Verrazano narrows were as yet incomplete. The local populace rushed to the site and quickly dug defensive embankments. The French ship sailed away without attacking, and the approaching fleet turned out to be 10 ships that had been captured from the French. In 1703, the New York Assembly had assigned Mayor William Peartree to raise £1500 to complete the project. However, blame was quickly shifted to Governor Cornbury, with accusations of embezzlement. The charge prompted the New York Assembly to cut off funding to the governor and manage the colonial budget directly. No French or native incursions into New York Colony occurred throughout the 11-year war.

===Religious issues and politics===
Despite an Anglican minority, Governor Cornbury was determined to secure the Church of England as the state religion in the colonies. He was shocked to discover that public funds had been used to build and maintain a Presbyterian church in the village of Jamaica on Long Island. On 4 July 1704, the church, parsonage, and associated buildings were confiscated for use by the Anglican Church.

Cornbury&#x27;s most notorious religious scandal involved Reverend Francis Makemie (1658–1708), the &quot;Father of American Presbyterianism&quot;. During 1683–1706, the minister established the first Presbyterian congregations in America, primarily in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. While passing through New York in January 1707, Reverend Makemie led a worship service in a private home. During the service, he performed an infant baptism. In doing so, he violated several English laws prohibiting the practice of &quot;dissenter&quot; religions.

It was a time of increased tension: the Acts of Union (1706 &amp; 1707) had just united England and Scotland under a single government. Most Scots vehemently disapproved of the change, Presbyterians in particular. Rumours circulated about dissenter groups plotting subversion, riot or revolution. High Tories like Cornbury rallied to the cry of &quot;The Church in Danger&quot; – the supposed threat posed by Whigs and Nonconformists. Governor Cornbury duly arrested the visiting minister for preaching without a license. Seven weeks later Makemie faced trial by the Supreme Court of New York and was acquitted. Furious, the governor ordered the minister to pay all expenses for the trial.

During this period Cornbury found himself at odds with the Lewis Morris (1671–1746), then a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council and eventual rival of Cornbury. Cornbury responded by suspending Morris from the upper house in September 1704. Morris apologised to the governor and was reinstated, but in December 1704 Cornbury suspended him again.

Meanwhile, the Anglican Church prospered. Trinity Church, the first meetinghouse in New York, had opened for worship on 3 Mar 1698. In 1705, Governor Cornbury and Lewis Morris – despite the animosity between the two – arranged to add 215 acres from Morris&#x27;s holdings, known as The Queen&#x27;s Farm, to the Trinity Church holdings. The site was earmarked for a new college, which was finally founded in 1754 as King&#x27;s College. On 1 May 1784 the name was changed to Columbia University. Columbia University denies having ties to the former governor:

The first street in New York was paved, with sidewalks install in 1648 by Anneke Lockermans Van Cortland, when the city was still New Amsterdam. This set the tone for the English to follow. During the second half of Cornbury&#x27;s term, the streets and sidewalks were paved with cobblestone (in the area around Trinity Church), fire-buckets were positioned throughout the town, and a fledgling fire department was created with two hooks and eight ladders.

===End of governorship===
Meanwhile, in New York, Tory Governor Cornbury had become another casualty of the Whig revolution (he was recalled in June 1708). The cabinet believed that he had been too passive militarily. It also seemed unlikely that he would be able to procure the necessary funding from the contentious colonial assembly.

==Post-governorship==
In December 1708, he was put under house arrest by the sheriff of New York City for outstanding debts. Since 1705, both the New York &amp; New Jersey Assemblies had refused to appropriate funds for the governor&#x27;s salary and support of the colonial garrison. Both were forced to survive on borrowed funds, which had led to Cornbury accruing large debts. As a result, the ex-governor was still in town to welcome his successor, John Lovelace, Baron of Hurley (who arrived on 18 December 1708). Unfortunately, the new governor died five months later. Administration of the colony then fell to Richard Ingoldsby, who had been Cornbury&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor and avid supporter. Thus colonial policy continued unchanged. Colonists continued to beg for Cornbury&#x27;s intervention in local affairs for at least another decade. After a series of acting governors, General Robert Hunter arrived in 1710 to fill the post permanently. He served until 1720.

Cornbury&#x27;s fortunes found reversal soon after his recall as governor. His father&#x27;s death elevated him to the Peerage, and with it, Parliamentary immunity against civil actions, thus rescuing him from debtors&#x27; prison (31 Oct 1709). Upon his return to England, the queen awarded him a pension and lodging at Somerset House, one of the royal palaces. He joined the Harley Ministry as first commissioner of the admiralty in December 1711.

Although a member of Harley&#x27;s cabinet, Cornbury was able to remain untainted by the series of scandals that rocked the Tory leadership during this period: His old mentor, the Duke of Marlborough was removed from his place as Captain-General (29 December 1711), charged with bribery and embezzlement. Several &quot;High Tories&quot; were implicated in the Jacobite rising of 1715, which supported James Francis Edward Stuart as the pretender to the throne. Cornbury was apparently not linked to Robert Harley (1st Earl of Oxford)&#x27;s South Seas Bubble, which caused the ruin and bankruptcy of many aristocrats and office holders in 1720–1721.

===Special emissary to Hanover and death===
Amid political turmoil, Queen Anne sent Cornbury as a replacement for Harley&#x27;s emissary to her successor, George, Elector of Hannover (1660–1727; King 1714–1727). From his arrival in August 1714 until the Queen&#x27;s death in November, Cornbury dined and spent his evenings with the royal family. &quot;My Lord Clarendon is very much approved of at Court&quot;, wrote his secretary, John Gay.

Once King George I assumed the British throne following the Hanoverian Succession, his animosity toward the Tories became apparent, and Cornbury lost his position as an emissary. Cornbury continued to be active in the House of Lords until about 1720. He died on 31 March 1723 at Chelsea, London, his death received little notice. He is interred in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey, in the Hyde family crypt.

==Conduct in office==
Hyde has maintained a scandalous reputation for much of history, known for being highly corrupt and being an easy caricature of the wrongs and incompetence that American colonists perceived came as a result of being under British colonial rule.

Shelly Ross, an author and journalist, agreed with this viewpoint and saw Cornbury as corrupt, in both moral and governmental terms. Ross wrote that Cornbury&#x27;s alleged misconduct helped to start the American Revolution, and that framers of the constitution had Lord Cornbury in mind when they wrote the articles of impeachment.

The only modern biography that focuses solely on Hyde was written by New York University professor Patricia Bonomi in 1998 and takes a more nuanced view of Cornbury.

===Alleged cross-dressing===
Lord Cornbury was alleged to have opened the 1702 New York Assembly in drag. He was dressed in a &quot;hooped gown and elaborate headdress and carrying a fan, much in the style of the fashionable Queen Anne.&quot;

Ross, writing in 1988, called him a transvestite and takes his cross-dressing as fact. However, Bonomi (1998) concluded that he was not a crossdresser, because a royal governor probably could not have publicly cross-dressed without severe censure. Bonomi further states that the contemporary descriptions of Cornbury do not comport with his being a transvestite, either homosexual or heterosexual, but that the sporadic nature of his alleged cross-dressing would place him at the more heterosexual end of the &quot;broad middle category of transvestites&quot;, especially because the &quot;evidence regarding Cornbury&#x27;s personal life is devoid of any of the traits of transgenderism or transexualism that occupy the rest of this category.&quot; She writes that it is possible to speculate that his attachment to &quot;the military and to manly honor was a way of compensating for an incompletely developed masculine identity.&quot; Or his transvestitic fetish, if he had one, and the guilt and psychological distress it caused might have found outlet in his alleged rages. She speculates that this fetish may have intensified after the death of his wife, emboldening him to attempt to &quot;pass&quot; as a woman in public.

Bonomi concludes that Lord Cornbury&#x27;s crossdressing was invented by his political enemies to &quot;assassinate&quot; his character.

=== Monetary corruption ===
According to Ross, Cornbury dispensed thousands of state acres in a corrupt fashion. The most solid evidence of misappropriation of land by Lord Cornbury came in 1706, when he granted a swath of government land south of Albany to nine friends of his, including his secretary. The grant, which included part of the Great Nine Partners Patent, was probably illegal and was made by Hyde for cash. The land later became Hyde Park (named for Lord Cornbury), the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Virtually every reference written about Lord Cornbury has described him in disparaging terms. The criticisms can be traced to a complaint, written in the spring of 1706, to the newly appointed Whig ministry by Lewis Morris (1671–1746), and Samuel Jennings (about 1660–1708) in behalf of the New Jersey Assembly. In 1708, the New York Assembly followed suit with their letter. Specific accusations included:

* Asserting royal prerogative over locally elected assemblies
* Accepting bribes
* Persecution of the Presbyterians by confiscating church property and imprisoning their ministers
* Embezzlement of defense funds
* Fiscal mismanagement, leading to a large amount of public &amp; personal debt

Such complaints were common then. Similar allegations were made about the royal governors who preceded and succeeded Cornbury, in New York, New Jersey, and other colonies. What was unique about Governor Cornbury was the allegation of wearing women&#x27;s clothes.

A generation later, the story was told of a conversation about Lord Cornbury between Horace Walpole (1717–1797, a famous Whig minister and author) and George James Williams (1719–1805, an author). Walpole recounted:
Williams&#x27;s reported reply:
==Family==
Lord Cornbury eloped with Katherine O&#x27;Brien, the 8th Baroness Clifton on 10 July 1685. She was the daughter of Henry O&#x27;Brien, Lord Ibrackan, 7th Earl of Thomond. Lady Cornbury died at the age of 43 in New York on 11 August 1706 and was buried at Trinity Church, New York.

Children:

* Catherine Hyde (died young)
* Mary Flora Hyde (died 1697)
* Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury &amp; 9th Baron Clifton (1691 – February 1713); died unmarried at age 22 due to fever.
* Theodosia Hyde, 10th Baroness Clifton (9 November 1695 – 30 July 1722). Married August 1713 to John Bligh, the 1st Earl of Darnley (1687–1728). Died of sepsis at age 26 shortly after the birth of her 7th child.

===Portrait===
No confirmed contemporary portraits of Cornbury exist. An uncaptioned 18th-century portrait that hangs in the New-York Historical Society has been commonly believed to be Governor Cornbury wearing a dress. Professor Bonomi suggested that the subject was not Cornbury. However, other art historians have remained unconvinced. The New-York Historical Society posits that, whether or not the disputed subject of the painting is Cornbury, the controversy represents &quot;an historically early discussion of gender cross-dressing.&quot;
The Dallas Museum of Art has a different portrait of unknown provenance also ascribed to be &quot;Lord Cornbury in a Dress&quot;, painted sometime between 1705 and 1750.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Androboros&quot; [&quot;man-eater&quot; in corrupted Greek], a play by Robert Hunter, Cornbury&#x27;s successor as Governor of New York (1710–1719) was a satire that ridiculed prominent New York citizens, including Lord Cornbury (as &quot;Lord Oinobaros&quot; [&quot;heavy with wine&quot;]). Crossdressing was a central theme in the play. It was one of the first plays written and published in Britain&#x27;s American colonies. It was recently revived by the Peculiar Works Project of New York City on 4–6 November 2016, under the direction of Ralph Lewis.

Cornbury was the lead character in the play &quot;Cornbury: The Queen&#x27;s Governor&quot; – first presented as a staged reading at The Public Theater on 12 April 1976, the play was written by William M. Hoffman and Anthony Holland. Joseph Papp produced and Holland directed, with Joseph Maher in the role of Cornbury. The play was revived in 2009 at the Hudson Guild Theater under the direction of Tim Cusack. David Greenspan played Cornbury.

He also made appearances in Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s historical saga novel &quot;New York&quot;, in Daniel Pinkwater&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of a Cat-Whiskered Girl&quot;, and in Robert McCammon&#x27;s &quot;Matthew Corbett&quot; series of novels.

<doc id="243879" wikidata="Q221936" url="?curid=243879" title="Nanoarchaeum equitans">
<text>Nanoarchaeum equitans is a species of marine archaea that was discovered in 2002 in a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Iceland on the Kolbeinsey Ridge by Karl Stetter. It has been proposed as the first species in a new phylum, and is the only species within the genus Nanoarchaeum. Strains of this microbe were also found on the Sub-polar Mid Oceanic Ridge, and in the Obsidian Pool in Yellowstone National Park. Since it grows in temperatures approaching boiling, at about , it is considered to be a thermophile. It grows best in environments with a pH of 6, and a salinity concentration of 2%. &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; appears to be an obligate symbiont on the archaeon &quot;Ignicoccus&quot;; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive. &quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot; cannot synthesize lipids but obtains them from its host. Its cells are only 400 nm in diameter, making it the smallest known living organism, and the smallest known archaeon.

&quot;N. equitans&quot;″ genome consists of a single circular chromosome, and has an average GC-content of 31.6%. It lacks almost all of the genes required for the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors, and lipids, but encodes everything needed for repair and replication. &quot;N. equitans&quot; contains several genes that encode proteins employed in recombination, suggesting that &quot;N. equitans&quot; can undergo homologous recombination. A total of 95% of its DNA encodes for proteins or stable RNA molecules.

&quot;N. equitans&quot; has small appendages that come out of its circular structure. The cell surface is covered by a thin, lattice-shaped S-layer, which provides structure and protection for the entire cell.

==Genome==
&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; (580 Kbp in size, with 515 protein-coding genes) was regarded as a cellular unit with the smallest genome size until 2003 when &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; was sequenced (491 Kbp, with 536 protein-coding genes).

Genetically, &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; is peculiar in that its 16S RNA sequence is undetectable by the most common methods. Initial examination of single-stranded ribosomal RNA indicated that the organism most likely belonged to the Archaea domain. However, its difference from the existing phyla, &quot;Euryarchaeota&quot; and Thermoproteota, was as great as the difference between the phyla. Therefore, it was given its own phylum, called &quot;Nanoarchaeota&quot;. However, another group (see References) compared all of the open reading frames to the other Archaea. They argue that the initial sample, ribosomal RNA only, was biased and &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; actually belongs to the &quot;Euryarchaeota&quot; phylum.

The sequencing of the &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; genome has revealed a wealth of information about the organism&#x27;s biology. The genes for several vital metabolic pathways appear to be missing. &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; cannot synthesize most nucleotides, amino acids, lipids, and cofactors. The cell most likely obtains these biomolecules from Ignicoccus. In particular, &quot;N. equitans&quot; lacks all of the genes that encode purine nucleotide biosynthesis in other organisms. However, unlike many parasitic microbes, &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; has many DNA repair enzymes, as well as everything necessary to carry out DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This may explain why the genome lacks the large stretches of non-coding DNA characteristic of other parasites.

The organism&#x27;s ability to produce its own ATP is also in question.

&quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; lacks the ability to metabolize hydrogen and sulfur for energy, as many thermophiles do. It does have five subunits of an ATP synthase as well as pathways for oxidative deamination. Whether it obtains energy from biological molecules imported from &quot;Ignicoccus&quot;, or whether it receives ATP directly is currently unknown. The genome and proteome composition of &quot;N. equitans&quot; are marked with the signatures of dual adaptation – one to high temperature and the other to obligate parasitism (or symbiosis).

<text>Nanoarchaeota (Greek, &quot;dwarf or tiny ancient one&quot;) is a proposed phylum (&quot;Candidatus&quot; Nanoarchaeota) in the domain Archaea that currently has only one representative, &quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot;, which was discovered in a submarine hydrothermal vent and first described in 2002. 

==Taxonomy==
Members of the Nanoarchaeota are associated with different host organisms and environmental conditions. Despite small size, a reduced genome and limited respiration, members of the Nanoarchaeota have unusual metabolic features. For example, &quot;N. equitans&quot; has a complex and highly developed intercellular communication system.

The phylogeny of the Nanoarchaeota is anchored by its only cultured representative, &quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot;, which clusters in a separate evolutionary group than other archaea, which have recently been reclassified. Further analysis has shown that &quot;N. equitans&quot; diverged early on in the evolution of Archaea, as indicated by the 16S rRNA sequence. This suggests that they occupy a deeply branching position within this group.

The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

== Characteristics ==
Cells of &quot;N. equitans&quot; are spherical with a diameter of approximately 400 nm, and have a very short and compact DNA sequence with the entire genome containing only 490,885 base pairs. While they have the genetic code to carry out processing and repair, they cannot carry out certain biosynthetic and metabolic processes such as lipid, amino-acid, cofactor, or nucleotide synthesis. Due to its limited machinery, it is an obligate parasite, the only one known in the Archaea. Because of their unusual ss rRNA sequences, they are difficult to detect using standard polymerase chain reaction methods. Cells of &quot;N. equitans&quot; contain a normal S-layer with sixfold symmetry with a 15 nm lattice constant.

== Genome structure ==
Small cells between 100 and 400 nm in diameter and highly streamlined genomes of 0.491-0.606 Mbp characterize nanoarchaeotes. The genomes of described nanoarchaeotes demonstrate different degrees of reduction, which is compatible with a host dependent lifestyle. Certain nanaoarchaeotes still have genes for the CRISPR-Cas systems, archaeal flagella, and the gluconeogenesis pathway.

== Habitat ==
Nanoarchaeotes are obligate symbionts that grow attached to an archaeal host known as Ignicoccus. Both terrestrial hot springs and underwater hydrothermal vents have yielded isolates in the genus &quot;Nanoarchaeum&quot; . However, there is evidence that nanoarcheotes reside in a variety of habitats outside of marine thermal vents.  Genetic evidence for members of the Nanoarchaeota has been discovered to be pervasive in terrestrial hot springs and mesophilic hypersaline habitats using primers created based on the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of &quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot;. In addition, the discovery of ribosomal sequences in photic-zone water samples taken distant from hydrothermal vents raises the possibility that Nanoarchaeota are an ubiquitous and diversified group of Archaea that can live in habitats with a variety of temperatures and geochemical settings.
== Metabolism ==
Although much of the metabolism of members of the Nanoarchaeota is unknown, its host is an autotroph that grows on elemental sulphur as an electron acceptor and H2 as an electron donor. The majority of recognized metabolic processes, such as the creation of monomers like amino acids, nucleotides, and coenzymes, lack recognizable genes in this organism.
