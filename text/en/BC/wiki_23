<text>The Iran hostage crisis () was a terrorist attack on the United States embassy in Tehran in which 53 Americans were taken hostage on November 4, 1979. The Americans, including diplomats and civilians, were seized by a group of armed students, supporters of the Iranian Revolution, among them Hossein Dehghan (future Iranian Minister of Defense), Mohammad Ali Jafari (future Revolutionary Guards Commander-In-Chief) and Mohammad Bagheri (future Chief of the General Staff of the Iranian Army). The crisis was a pivotal episode in the history of Iran–United States relations. On January 20, 1981, after the signing of the Algiers Accords, the hostages were released.

Time magazine described the crisis as an entanglement of vengeance and mutual incomprehension. U.S. President Jimmy Carter called the hostage-taking an act of &quot;blackmail&quot; and the hostages &quot;victims of terrorism and anarchy&quot;. In Iran, it was seen as an act against the U.S. and its perceived attempts to undermine the revolution and its long-standing support of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979. After Pahlavi was overthrown, he was granted asylum and admitted to the U.S. for cancer treatment. The new Iranian regime demanded his return in order to stand trial for the crimes he was accused of committing against Iranians during his rule through his secret police. These demands were rejected, which Iran saw as U.S. complicity in those abuses. The U.S. saw the hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, which granted diplomats immunity from arrest and made diplomatic compounds inviolable. 

Six American diplomats who had evaded capture were rescued by a joint CIA–Canadian effort on January 27, 1980. The crisis reached a climax in early 1980 after diplomatic negotiations failed to win the release of the hostages. Carter ordered the U.S. military to attempt a rescue mission – Operation Eagle Claw – using warships that included and , which were patrolling the waters near Iran. The failed attempt on April 24, 1980, resulted in the death of one Iranian civilian and the accidental deaths of eight American servicemen after one of the helicopters crashed into a transport aircraft. U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned his position following the failure. In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, beginning the Iran–Iraq War. These events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with Algeria acting as a mediator.

Political analysts cited the standoff as a major factor in the continuing downfall of Carter&#x27;s presidency and his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election. The hostages were formally released into United States custody the day after the signing of the Algiers Accords, just minutes after American President Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. In Iran, the crisis strengthened the prestige of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the political power of theocrats who opposed any normalization of relations with the West. The crisis also led to American economic sanctions against Iran, which further weakened ties between the two countries.

==Background==
===1953 coup d&#x27;état===

During the Second World War, the British and the Soviet governments invaded and occupied Iran, forcing the first Pahlavi monarch, Reza Shah Pahlavi, to abdicate in favor of his eldest son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The two nations claimed that they acted preemptively in order to stop Reza Shah from aligning his petroleum-rich country with Nazi Germany. However, the Shah&#x27;s declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops, were probably the real reasons for the invasion of Iran.

The United States did not participate in the invasion but it secured Iran&#x27;s independence after the war ended by applying intense diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union which forced it to withdraw from Iran in 1946.

By the 1950s, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was engaged in a power struggle with Iran&#x27;s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty. Mosaddegh led a general strike, demanding an increased share of the nation&#x27;s petroleum revenue from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which was operating in Iran. The UK retaliated by reducing the amount of revenue which the Iranian government received. In 1953, the CIA and MI6 helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; codenamed Operation Ajax, allowing the Shah to extend his power. For the next two decades the Shah reigned as an absolute monarch. &quot;Disloyal&quot; elements within the state were purged. The U.S. continued to support the Shah after the coup, with the CIA training the Iranian secret police. In the subsequent decades of the Cold War, various economic, cultural, and political issues united Iranian opposition against the Shah and led to his eventual overthrow.

===Carter administration===
Months before the Iranian Revolution, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi at a state dinner in Tehran, saluting the Shah&#x27;s character. After the revolution commenced in February 1979 with the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini from exile, the American Embassy was occupied, and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy&#x27;s front-facing windows that they were replaced with bulletproof glass. The embassy&#x27;s staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly one thousand earlier in the decade.

The Carter administration tried to mitigate anti-American feeling by promoting a new relationship with the &quot;de facto&quot; Iranian government and continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize. However, on October 22, 1979, the United States permitted the Shah, who had lymphoma, to enter New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for medical treatment. The State Department had discouraged this decision, understanding the political delicacy. But in response to pressure from influential figures including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Council on Foreign Relations Chairman David Rockefeller, the Carter administration decided to grant it.

The Shah&#x27;s admission to the United States intensified Iranian revolutionaries&#x27; anti-Americanism and spawned rumors of another U.S.–backed coup that would re-install him. Khomeini, who had been exiled by the Shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the &quot;Great Satan&quot;, as he called the U.S., talking of &quot;evidence of American plotting.&quot; In addition to ending what they believed was American sabotage of the revolution, the hostage takers hoped to depose the provisional revolutionary government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the U.S. and extinguish Islamic revolutionary order in Iran. The occupation of the embassy on November 4, 1979, was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the Shah to stand trial in Iran in exchange for the hostages.

A later study claimed that there had been no American plots to overthrow the revolutionaries, and that a CIA intelligence-gathering mission at the embassy had been &quot;notably ineffectual, gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language, Persian.&quot; Its work, the study said, was &quot;routine, prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere.&quot;

==Prelude==
===First attempt===

On the morning of February 14, 1979, the Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a Marine named Kenneth Kraus hostage. Ambassador William H. Sullivan surrendered the embassy to save lives, and with the assistance of Iranian Foreign Minister Ebrahim Yazdi, returned the embassy to U.S. hands within three hours. Kraus was injured in the attack, kidnapped by the militants, tortured, tried, and convicted of murder. He was to be executed, but President Carter and Sullivan secured his release within six days. This incident became known as the Valentine&#x27;s Day Open House.

===Second attempt===
The next attempt to seize the American Embassy was planned for September 1979 by Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a student at the time. He consulted with the heads of the Islamic associations of Tehran&#x27;s main universities, including the University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology (Polytechnic of Tehran), and Iran University of Science and Technology. They named their group Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line.

Asgharzadeh later said there were five students at the first meeting, two of whom wanted to target the Soviet Embassy because the USSR was &quot;a Marxist and anti-God regime&quot;. Two others, Mohsen Mirdamadi and Habibolah Bitaraf, supported Asgharzadeh&#x27;s chosen target, the United States. &quot;Our aim was to object against the American government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours,&quot; Asgharzadeh said. &quot;Announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way.&quot; Mirdamadi told an interviewer, &quot;We intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more.&quot; Masoumeh Ebtekar, the spokeswoman for the Iranian students during the crisis, said that those who rejected Asgharzadeh&#x27;s plan did not participate in the subsequent events.

The students observed the procedures of the Marine Security Guards from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy. They also drew on their experiences from the recent revolution, during which the U.S. Embassy grounds were briefly occupied. They enlisted the support of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards.

According to the group and other sources, Ayatollah Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand. The students had wanted to inform him, but according to the author Mark Bowden, Ayatollah Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha persuaded them not to do so. Khoeiniha feared that the government would use the police to expel the students as they had the occupiers in February. The provisional government had been appointed by Khomeini, so Khomeini was likely to go along with the government&#x27;s request to restore order. On the other hand, Khoeiniha knew that if Khomeini first saw that the occupiers were faithful supporters of him (unlike the leftists in the first occupation) and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover, it would be &quot;very hard, perhaps even impossible,&quot; for him to oppose the takeover, and this would paralyze the Bazargan administration, which Khoeiniha and the students wanted to eliminate.

Supporters of the takeover stated that their motivation was fear of another American-backed coup against their popular revolution.

===Takeover===

On November 4, 1979, one of the demonstrations organized by Iranian student unions loyal to Khomeini erupted into an all-out conflict right outside the walled compound housing the U.S. Embassy.

At about 6:30 a.m., the ringleaders gathered between three hundred and five hundred selected students and briefed them on the battle plan. A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy&#x27;s gates and hid them beneath her chador.

At first, the students planned a symbolic occupation, in which they would release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order. This was reflected in placards saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid. We just want to sit in.&quot; When the embassy guards brandished firearms, the protesters retreated, with one telling the Americans, &quot;We don&#x27;t mean any harm.&quot; But as it became clear that the guards would not use deadly force and that a large, angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to cheer the occupiers and jeer the hostages, the plan changed. According to one embassy staff member, buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy shortly after the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line broke through the gates.

As Khomeini&#x27;s followers had hoped, Khomeini supported the takeover. According to Foreign Minister Yazdi, when he went to Qom to tell Khomeini about it, Khomeini told him to &quot;go and kick them out.&quot; But later that evening, back in Tehran, Yazdi heard on the radio that Khomeini had issued a statement supporting the seizure, calling it &quot;the second revolution&quot; and the embassy an &quot;American spy den in Tehran.&quot;
The Marines and embassy staff were blindfolded by the occupiers and then paraded in front of assembled photographers. In the first couple of days, many of the embassy workers who had sneaked out of the compound or had not been there at the time of the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages. Six American diplomats managed to avoid capture and went into hiding until one of the diplomats Robert Anders called his Canadian counterpart John Sheardown seeking help. The group of six stayed in the personal homes of two Canadian diplomats. Two of the six stayed with Canadian Ambassador Kenneth Taylor, the other four staying with the Sheardown family for 79 days. In a joint covert operation known as the Canadian Caper, the Canadian government and the CIA managed to smuggle them out of Iran on January 28, 1980, using Canadian passports and a cover story that identified them as a film crew. Others went to the Swedish Embassy in Tehran for three months.

A State Department diplomatic cable of November 8, 1979, details &quot;A Tentative, Incomplete List of U.S. Personnel Being Held in the Embassy Compound.&quot;

===Motivations===
The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi return to Iran for trial and execution. The U.S. maintained that the Shah—who was to die less than a year later, in July 1980—had come to America for medical attention. The group&#x27;s other demands included that the U.S. government apologize for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran, including the overthrow of Prime Minister Mosaddegh in 1953, and that Iran&#x27;s frozen assets in the United States be released.
The initial plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time, but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support. Some attributed the decision not to release the hostages quickly to President Carter&#x27;s failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran. His initial response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes for a strategic anti-communist alliance with the Ayatollah. As some of the student leaders had hoped, Iran&#x27;s moderate prime minister, Bazargan, and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the takeover.

The duration of the hostages&#x27; captivity has also been attributed to internal Iranian revolutionary politics. As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran&#x27;s president:

This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people&#x27;s vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.

Various leftist student groups also supported the taking of hostages at the US embassy. The embassy take-over was aimed at strengthening the new regime against liberal elements in the government, portraying the regime as a &quot;revolutionary force&quot; while winning over the major following that the People&#x27;s Mojahedin of Iran had amongst students in Iran. According to scholar Daniel Pipes, writing in 1980, the Marxist-leaning leftists and the Islamists shared a common antipathy toward market-based reforms under the late Shah, and both subsumed individualism, including the unique identity of women, under conservative, though contrasting, visions of collectivism. Accordingly, both groups favored the Soviet Union over the United States in the early months of the Iranian Revolution. The Soviets, and possibly their allies Cuba, Libya, and East Germany, were suspected of providing indirect assistance to the participants in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The Palestine Liberation Organization under Yasser Arafat provided personnel, intelligence liaisons, funding, and training for Khomeini&#x27;s forces before and after the revolution and was suspected of playing a role in the embassy crisis. Fidel Castro reportedly praised Khomeini as a revolutionary anti-imperialist who could find common cause between revolutionary leftists and anti-American Islamists. Both expressed disdain for modern capitalism and a preference for authoritarian collectivism. Cuba and its socialist ally Venezuela, under Hugo Chávez, would later form ALBA in alliance with the Islamic Republic as a counter to neoliberal American influence.

Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding, to buttress their claim that the U.S. was trying to destabilize the new regime.

By embracing the hostage-taking under the slogan &quot;America can&#x27;t do a thing,&quot; Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism of his controversial theocratic constitution, which was scheduled for a referendum vote in less than one month. The referendum was successful, and after the vote, both leftists and theocrats continued to use allegations of pro-Americanism to suppress their opponents: relatively moderate political forces that included the Iranian Freedom Movement, the National Front, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, and later President Abolhassan Banisadr. In particular, carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage-takers led to the disempowerment and resignation of moderate figures such as Bazargan. The failed rescue attempt and the political danger of any move seen as accommodating America delayed a negotiated release of the hostages. After the crisis ended, leftists and theocrats turned on each other, with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the left.

== Documents discovered inside the American embassy ==

Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding, in order to buttress their statement that the United States was trying to destabilize the new regime with the assistance of Iranian moderates who were in league with the U.S. The documents – including telegrams, correspondence, and reports from the U.S. State Department and the CIA – were published in a series of books which were titled &quot;Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den&quot; (). According to a 1997 Federation of American Scientists bulletin, by 1995, 77 volumes of &quot;Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den&quot; had been published. Many of these volumes are now available online.

==The 444-day crisis==
===Living conditions of the hostages===
The hostage-takers, declaring their solidarity with other &quot;oppressed minorities&quot; and declaring their respect for &quot;the special place of women in Islam,&quot; released one woman and two African Americans on November 19. Before release, these hostages were required by their captors to hold a press conference in which Kathy Gross and William Quarles praised the revolution&#x27;s aims, but four further women and six African-Americans were released the following day. According to the then United States Ambassador to Lebanon, John Gunther Dean, the 13 hostages were released with the assistance of the Palestine Liberation Organization, after Yassir Arafat and Abu Jihad personally traveled to Tehran to secure a concession. The only African-American hostage not released that month was Charles A. Jones, Jr. One more hostage, a white man named Richard Queen, was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity.

The hostages were initially held at the embassy, but after the takers took the cue from the failed rescue mission, the detainees were scattered around Iran in order to make a single rescue attempt impossible. Three high-level officials – Bruce Laingen, Victor L. Tomseth, and Mike Howland – were at the Foreign Ministry at the time of the takeover. They stayed there for several months, sleeping in the ministry&#x27;s formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom. At first, they were treated as diplomats, but after the provisional government fell, the treatment of them deteriorated. By March, the doors to their living space were kept &quot;chained and padlocked.&quot;

By midsummer 1980, the Iranians had moved the hostages to prisons in Tehran to prevent escapes or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food deliveries. The final holding area, from November 1980 until their release, was the Teymur Bakhtiar mansion in Tehran, where the hostages were finally given tubs, showers, and hot and cold running water. Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors – including the former Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor – visited the hostages over the course of the crisis and relayed information back to the U.S. government, including dispatches from Laingen.

Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were &quot;guests&quot; and it also stated that they were being treated with respect. Asgharzadeh, the leader of the students, described the original plan as a nonviolent and symbolic action in which the students would use their &quot;gentle and respectful treatment&quot; of the hostages to dramatize the offended sovereignty and dignity of Iran to the entire world. In America, an Iranian chargé d&#x27;affaires, Ali Agha, stormed out of a meeting with an American official, exclaiming: &quot;We are not mistreating the hostages. They are being very well taken care of in Tehran. They are our guests.&quot;

The actual treatment of the hostages was far different. They described beatings, theft, and fear of bodily harm. Two of them, William Belk and Kathryn Koob, recalled being paraded blindfolded before an angry, chanting crowd outside the embassy. Others reported having their hands bound &quot;day and night&quot; for days or even weeks, long periods of solitary confinement, and months of being forbidden to speak to one another or to stand, walk, or leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom. All of the hostages &quot;were threatened repeatedly with execution, and took it seriously.&quot; The hostage-takers played Russian roulette with their victims.

One hostage, Michael Metrinko, was kept in solitary confinement for several months. On two occasions, when he expressed his opinion of Ayatollah Khomeini, he was severely punished. The first time, he was kept in handcuffs for two weeks, and the second time, he was beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks.

Another hostage, U.S. Army medic Donald Hohman, went on a hunger strike for several weeks, and two hostages attempted suicide. Steve Lauterbach broke a water glass and slashed his wrists after being locked in a dark basement room with his hands tightly bound. He was found and rushed to the hospital by guards. Jerry Miele, a CIA communications technician, smashed his head into the corner of a door, knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash. &quot;Naturally withdrawn&quot; and looking &quot;ill, old, tired, and vulnerable,&quot; Miele had become the butt of his guards&#x27; jokes, and they had rigged up a mock electric chair to emphasize the fate that awaited him. His fellow hostages applied first aid and raised the alarm, and he was taken to a hospital after a long delay which was caused by the guards.

Other hostages described threats to boil their feet in oil (Alan B. Golacinski), cut their eyes out (Rick Kupke), or kidnap and kill a disabled son in America and &quot;start sending pieces of him to your wife&quot; (David Roeder).

Four hostages tried to escape, and all of them were punished with stretches of solitary confinement when their escape attempts were discovered.
Queen, the hostage who was sent home because of his multiple sclerosis, first developed dizziness and numbness in his left arm six months before his release. At first, the Iranians misdiagnosed his symptoms as a reaction to drafts of cold air. When warmer confinement did not help, he was told that it was &quot;nothing&quot; because the symptoms would disappear soon. Over the months, the numbness spread to his right side, and the dizziness worsened until he &quot;was literally flat on his back, unable to move without growing dizzy and throwing up.&quot;

The cruelty of the Iranian prison guards became &quot;a form of slow torture.&quot; The guards often withheld mail – telling one hostage, Charles W. Scott, &quot;I don&#x27;t see anything for you, Mr. Scott. Are you sure your wife has not found another man?&quot; – and the hostages&#x27; possessions went missing.

As the hostages were taken to the aircraft that would fly them out of Tehran, they were led through a gauntlet of students forming parallel lines and shouting, &quot;Marg bar Amrika&quot; (&quot;death to America&quot;). When the pilot announced that they were out of Iran, the &quot;freed hostages went wild with happiness. Shouting, cheering, crying, clapping, falling into one another&#x27;s arms.&quot;

===Impact in the United States===

In the United States, the hostage crisis created &quot;a surge of patriotism&quot; and left &quot;the American people more united than they have been on any issue in two decades.&quot; The hostage-taking was seen &quot;not just as a diplomatic affront,&quot; but as a &quot;declaration of war on diplomacy itself.&quot; Television news gave daily updates. In January 1980, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Walter Cronkite began ending each show by saying how many days the hostages had been captive. President Carter applied economic and diplomatic pressure: Oil imports from Iran were ended on November 12, 1979, and with Executive Order 12170, around US$8 billion of Iranian assets in the United States were frozen by the Office of Foreign Assets Control on November 14.

During the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1979, high school students made cards that were delivered to the hostages. Community groups across the country did the same, resulting in bales of Christmas cards. The National Christmas Tree was left dark except for the top star.

At the time, two Trenton, N.J., newspapers – &quot;The Trenton Times&quot; and &quot;The Trentonian&quot; and perhaps others around the country – printed full-page color American flags in their newspapers for readers to cut out and place in the front windows of their homes as support for the hostages until they were brought home safely.

Some Iranian Americans reported a backlash against them develop in the United States. According to activist Maziar Bahari, an anonymous friend told him, &quot;I had to hide my Iranian identity not to get beaten up, even at university.&quot;

According to Bowden, a pattern emerged in President Carter&#x27;s attempts to negotiate the hostages&#x27; release: &quot;Carter would latch on to a deal proffered by a top Iranian official and grant minor but humiliating concessions, only to have it scotched at the last minute by Khomeini.&quot;

===Canadian rescue of hostages===
On the day the hostages were seized, six American diplomats evaded capture and remained in hiding at the home of the Canadian diplomat John Sheardown, under the protection of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor. In late 1979, the government of Prime Minister Joe Clark secretly issued an Order in Council allowing Canadian passports to be issued to some American citizens so that they could escape. In cooperation with the CIA, which used the cover story of a film project, two CIA agents and the six American diplomats boarded a Swissair flight to Zürich, Switzerland, on January 28, 1980. Their rescue from Iran, known as the Canadian Caper, was fictionalized in the 1981 film &quot;Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper&quot; and the 2012 film &quot;Argo&quot;.

===Negotiations for release===
===Rescue attempts===

====First rescue attempt====

Cyrus Vance, the United States Secretary of State, had argued against the push by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor, for a military solution to the crisis. Vance, struggling with gout, went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend. On Friday Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the National Security Council where the president authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages. Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher, who attended the meeting in Vance&#x27;s place, did not inform Vance. Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski &quot;evil.&quot;

Late in the afternoon of April 24, 1980, eight RH‑53D helicopters flew from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; to a remote road serving as an airstrip in the Great Salt Desert of Eastern Iran, near Tabas. They encountered severe dust storms that disabled two of the helicopters, which were traveling in complete radio silence. Early the next morning, the remaining six helicopters met up with several waiting Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft at a landing site and refueling area designated &quot;Desert One&quot;.

At this point, a third helicopter was found to be unserviceable, bringing the total below the six deemed vital for the mission. The commander of the operation, Col. Charles Alvin Beckwith, recommended that the mission be aborted, and his recommendation was approved by President Carter. As the helicopters repositioned themselves for refueling, one ran into a C‑130 tanker aircraft and crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen and injuring several more.

Two hours into the flight, the crew of helicopter No. 6 saw a warning light indicating that a main rotor might be cracked. They landed in the desert, confirmed visually that a crack had started to develop, and stopped flying in accordance with normal operating procedure. Helicopter No. 8 landed to pick up the crew of No. 6, and abandoned No. 6 in the desert without destroying it. The report by Holloway&#x27;s group pointed out that a cracked helicopter blade could have been used to continue the mission and that its likelihood of catastrophic failure would have been low for many hours, especially at lower flying speeds. The report found that the pilot of No. 6 would have continued the mission if instructed to do so.

When the helicopters encountered two dust storms along the way to the refueling point, the second more severe than the first, the pilot of No. 5 turned back because the mine-laying helicopters were not equipped with terrain-following radar. The report found that the pilot could have continued to the refueling point if he had been told that better weather awaited him there, but because of the command for radio silence, he did not ask about the conditions ahead. The report also concluded that &quot;there were ways to pass the information&quot; between the refueling station and the helicopter force &quot;that would have small likelihood of compromising the mission&quot; – in other words, that the ban on communication had not been necessary at this stage.

Helicopter No. 2 experienced a partial hydraulic system failure but was able to fly on for four hours to the refueling location. There, an inspection showed that a hydraulic fluid leak had damaged a pump and that the helicopter could not be flown safely, nor repaired in time to continue the mission. Six helicopters were thought to be the absolute minimum required for the rescue mission, so with the force reduced to five, the local commander radioed his intention to abort. This request was passed through military channels to President Carter, who agreed.

In May 1980, the Joint Chiefs of Staff commissioned a Special Operations review group of six senior military officers, led by Adm. James L. Holloway III, to thoroughly examine all aspects of the rescue attempt. The group identified 23 issues that were significant in the failure of the mission, 11 of which it deemed major. The overriding issue was operational security – that is, keeping the mission secret so that the arrival of the rescue team at the embassy would be a complete surprise. This severed the usual relationship between pilots and weather forecasters; the pilots were not informed about the local dust storms. Another security requirement was that the helicopter pilots come from the same unit. The unit picked for the mission was a U.S. Navy mine-laying unit flying CH-53D Sea Stallions; these helicopters were considered the best suited for the mission because of their long range, large capacity, and compatibility with shipboard operations.

After the mission and its failure were made known publicly, Khomeini credited divine intervention on behalf of Islam, and his prestige skyrocketed in Iran. Iranian officials who favored release of the hostages, such as President Bani Sadr, were weakened. In America, President Carter&#x27;s political popularity and prospects for being re-elected in 1980 were further damaged after a television address on April 25 in which he explained the rescue operation and accepted responsibility for its failure.

====Planned second attempt====

A second rescue attempt, planned but never carried out, would have used highly modified YMC-130H Hercules aircraft. Three aircraft, outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the Shahid Shiroudi football stadium near the embassy, were modified under a rushed, top-secret program known as Operation Credible Sport. One crashed during a demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base on October 29, 1980, when its braking rockets were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire, but all on board survived. After Carter lost the presidential election in November, the project was abandoned.

The failed rescue attempt led to the creation of the 160th SOAR, a helicopter aviation Special Operations group.

== Resolution of the crisis based on the Algerian Proposal ==

===The vote of the Majlis===
Two days before the 1980 presidential elections in the United States, the Iranian parliament (Majlis) voted on November 2, 1980 the decision to release the American citizens detained in Iran if the United States accepted to meet a list of four conditions:

# First and foremost to unfreeze Iranian assets in U.S. and international banks
# To return the wealth collected by the late Shah during his reign
# To withdraw all lawsuits against Iran in the United States
# To pledge non-intervention in Iranian affairs

The message was immediately delivered by the Algerian foreign minister Sedikk Benyahia (Algeria being the protecting power of Iran in the United States) to the State Department with a letter confirming that the Algerian government was officially considered an intermediary by Iran.

The Iranian ministry of foreign affairs stressed that the United States government was requested to &quot;announce its response as soon as possible&quot; and &quot;to inform the world&quot; of the American answer to the hostage release conditions&quot;.

===Carter’s demand to Algeria===
Previously, at the request of the U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Algeria, which had been representing Iranian interests in Washington, D.C. (while Switzerland was representing US interests in Tehran), agreed to undertake a good offices mission in an attempt to facilitate a last-chance negotiation and the release of the hostages before Jimmy Carter leaves the White House. This mission, led by the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, involved engaging in a diplomatic shuttle by the Algerian ambassadors in each capital to enable indirect talks between the United States and Iran.

=== First phase of the Algerian intermediation : delivering messages ===

====&quot;The mailmen&quot;====
The two Algerian ambassadors in both countries were tasked only with transmitting messages between the negotiating teams without intervening in the substance of the discussions. Hence, they were dubbed &quot;the mailmen&quot; by the press.

====The deadlock====
As the U.S. State Department negotiators were unable to reach an agreement, based on the demands set by the vote of the Majlis, and as the Algerian team consisting of two ambassadors lacking any specific expertise, the negotiations were in a deadlock.That, the sources said, is the case despite the State Department&#x27;s announcement yesterday that Iran has raised several new questions about U.S. proposals for resolving the 14-month impasse. In another outwardly downbeat note yesterday, the department revealed that Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, in a telephone message from Algiers, said that &quot;serious problems continue to exist between the two sides.&quot;

Of principal concern to the Carter administration, the sources said, is that the linchpin of an agreement -- arrangements for transferring part of the estimated $8 to $14 billion in frozen Iranian assets held by the United States -- will take several weeks, or possibly months, to bring to the point that Iran feels sufficiently confident about U.S. faith to let the hostages go.

=== Second phase : The Algerian Proposal ===
&quot;Algeria started out as &quot;a simple mailman,&quot; delivering messages between the United States and Iran, but in the end it played a decisive mediator&#x27;s role in the negotiations for the release of the 52 American hostages and the return to Iran of assets frozen in the United States.&quot;

&quot;Algerian sources close to the negotiations said Algeria had faithfully observed its role as an intermediary until about a month ago, when &quot;a deadlock&quot; was reached between American and Iranian negotiators.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Wary Algeria Edged into Pivotal Role&quot; The New York Times, Jan. 26, 1981&quot;Realizing that the negotiations were certain to fail, just like previous attempts, due to complex issues that had remained unsolved, neither the State Department nor the Iranian authorities being unable to overcome the impasses, the Algerian authorities took the initiative to take an active part in the negotiations and entrusted the relaunch of these negotiations to Seghir Mostefai, highly experienced founder and head of the Central Bank of Algeria since the country&#x27;s independence in 1962, long-time member of the board of governors of the IMF and World Bank. Throughout his career Mostefai had maintained long-standing working relationships with both the Federal Reserve Bank (the institution in charge of freezing Iranian assets) and the Markazi Bank (Iranian central bank). He was approved by both sides to resume the negotiations on new grounds.

When Algeria started to play this active role a team led by Warren Christopher with members of both the State Department and the Treasury Department arrived in Algiers.

He formulated the plan that was called by the Iranians the &quot;Algerian proposal&quot;, a comprehensive agreement to resolve all disputes between the U.S. and Iran after he discussed with each party what claims and what conditions were acceptable to converge toward an agreement. The proposal included a trust-based role for the Central Bank of Algeria to facilitate the simultaneous release of U.S. hostages and the return of Iranian assets. Mostefai’s plan also envisioned the creation of an arbitration tribunal (later known as Iran-US Claims Tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands) to later resolve outstanding disputes progressively, enabling the release of American detainees without delay despite massive pending litigation.

=== Final outcome : The Algiers Accords ===
Negotiations on the Algerian proposal and the pivotal role played by the Algerian central bank finally led to the signing of the Algiers Accords by the three countries.

Based on the trusting relationship with the Algerian central bank, the Iranian authorities accepted that their assets would be transferred by the American authorities to an escrow account in the name of the Central Bank of Algeria acting as a neutral intermediary to collect the funds before the release of the hostages and to transfer these funds to Iran in a second phase after the release.

The Iranian assets under the form of gold bullion, cash and securities (mainly US Treasury Bonds) would be transferred to an escrow account of the Central Bank of Algeria kept at the Bank of England.

When the Bank of England notifies the Central Bank of Algeria that the agreed amount was transferred, the Iranians would be notified and the American hostages could be released.

One part of the transferred amount would be kept at the Central Bank of Algeria for pending settlements of U.S. claims to be presented to the arbitration tribunal progressively.

Finally, the United States transferred directly and indirectly to Iran a total amount of USD 7.956 billion (equivalent to USD 25+ billion in 2020).

=== Transfer at Algiers Airport ===
The Algerian authorities sent two identical Boeing 727 planes belonging to the national airlines company Air Algérie and a medical team.

The American hostages were transported from the different places where they were detained to Tehran airport. The Algerian medical team examined all the hostages and found them in good condition. When authorization was given by the Iranian authorities following Central Bank of Algeria’s confirmation that it had received the deposits, the boarding started. A group of the Algerian army’s special forces was present to oversee the boarding which was the moment the American citizens were officially put under the responsibility of Algeria.

The Algerian delegation and the American hostages were going to fly in the same plane. But for security reasons the second plane was used by the Algerians as a decoy due to the context of increasing military tension with Iraq.

After a stop in Greece the plane landed in Algiers. The Americans were greeted by Warren Christopher, the signatory of the Algiers Accords. At the airport, the Algerian authorities officially handed the hostages to the American delegation who took them in a U.S. Army aircraft to a US Air Force base in Wiesbaden before flying to the United States.
== Release ==

With the completion of negotiations signified by the signing of the Algiers Accords on January 19, 1981, the hostages were released on January 20, 1981. That day, minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president and while he was giving his inaugural address, the 52 American hostages were released to U.S. personnel. There are theories regarding why Iran postponed the release until that moment.

The hostages were flown on an Air Algeria Boeing 727-200 commercial airliner (registration 7T-VEM) from Tehran, Iran to Algiers, Algeria, where they were formally transferred to Warren M. Christopher, the representative of the United States, as a symbolic gesture of appreciation for the Algerian government&#x27;s help in resolving the crisis. The flight continued to Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany and on to an Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden, where former President Carter, acting as emissary, received them. After medical check-ups and debriefings, the hostages made a second flight to a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, where they were greeted by a large crowd. The released hostages were then flown to Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. From Newburgh, they traveled by bus to the United States Military Academy at West Point and stayed at the Thayer Hotel for three days, receiving a heroes&#x27; welcome all along the route. Ten days after their release, they were given a ticker tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes in New York City.

==Aftermath==
===Iran–Iraq War===
The Iraqi invasion of Iran occurred less than a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage. The journalist Stephen Kinzer argues that the dramatic change in American–Iranian relations, from allies to enemies, helped embolden the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and that the United States&#x27; anger with Iran led it to aid the Iraqis after the war turned against them. The United States supplied Iraq with, among other things, &quot;helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets.&quot; This assistance &quot;deepened and widened anti-American feeling in Iran.&quot;

===Consequences for Iran===

The hostage-taking is considered largely unsuccessful for Iran, as the negotiated settlement with the U.S. did not meet any of Iran&#x27;s original demands. Iran lost international support for its war against Iraq. However, anti-Americanism intensified, and the crisis served to benefit those Iranians who had supported it. Politicians such as Khoeiniha and Behzad Nabavi were left in a stronger position, while those associated with – or accused of association with – the U.S. were removed from the political picture. Khomeini biographer, Baqer Moin, described the crisis as &quot;a watershed in Khomeini&#x27;s life&quot; that transformed him from &quot;a cautious, pragmatic politician&quot; into &quot;a modern revolutionary single-mindedly pursuing a dogma.&quot; In Khomeini&#x27;s statements, &quot;imperialism&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; were &quot;negative words,&quot; while &quot;revolution&quot; &quot;became a sacred word, sometimes more important than &quot;Islam&quot;.&quot;

The Iranian government commemorates the event every year with a demonstration at the embassy and the burning of an American flag. However, on November 4, 2009, pro-democracy protesters and reformists demonstrated in the streets of Tehran. When the authorities encouraged them to chant &quot;death to America,&quot; the protesters instead chanted &quot;death to the dictator&quot; (referring to Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) and other anti-government slogans.

===Consequences for the United States===

Gifts, including lifetime passes to any minor league or Major League Baseball game, were showered on the hostages upon their return to the United States.

In 2000, the hostages and their families tried unsuccessfully to sue Iran under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. They originally won the case when Iran failed to provide a defense, but the State Department then tried to end the lawsuit, fearing that it would make international relations difficult. As a result, a federal judge ruled that no damages could be awarded to the hostages because of the agreement the United States had made when the hostages were freed.

The former U.S. Embassy building is now used by Iran&#x27;s government and affiliated groups. Since 2001 it has served as a museum to the revolution. Outside the door, there is a bronze model based on the Statue of Liberty on one side and a statue portraying one of the hostages on the other.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2006 that a group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had used the embassy to recruit &quot;martyrdom seekers&quot;: volunteers to carry out operations against Western and Israeli targets. Mohammad Samadi, a spokesman for the group, signed up several hundred volunteers in a few days.
===Diplomatic relations===
The United States and Iran broke off formal diplomatic relations over the hostage crisis. Iran selected Algeria as its protecting power in the United States, transferring the mandate to Pakistan in 1992. The United States selected Switzerland as its protecting power in Iran. Relations are maintained through the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy and the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy.
==Hostages==

There were 66 original captives: 63 of them were taken at the embassy and three of them were captured and held at the Foreign Ministry offices. Three of the hostages were operatives of the CIA. One of them was a chemical engineering student from URI.

* Four British missionaries, including John Coleman; his wife, Audrey Coleman; and Jean Waddell; released in late 1981

===Hostages who were honored===
All State Department and CIA employees who were taken hostage received the State Department Award for Valor. Political Officer Michael J. Metrinko received two: one for his time as a hostage and another for his daring rescue of Americans who had been jailed in Tabriz months before the embassy takeover.

The U.S. military later awarded the 20 servicemen among the hostages the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. The only hostage serviceman not issued the medal was Staff Sgt Joseph Subic, Jr., who &quot;did not behave under stress the way noncommissioned officers are expected to act&quot; – that is, he cooperated with the hostage-takers, according to other hostages.

The Humanitarian Service Medal was awarded to the servicemen of Joint Task Force 1–79, the planning authority for Operation Rice Bowl/Eagle Claw, who participated in the rescue attempt.

The Air Force Special Operations component of the mission was given the Air Force Outstanding Unit award for performing their part of the mission flawlessly, including evacuating the Desert One refueling site under extreme conditions.

===Compensation payments===
The deal that freed them reached between the United States and Iran and brokered by Algeria in January 1981 prevented the hostages from claiming any restitution from Iran due to foreign sovereign immunity and an executive agreement known as the &quot;Algiers Accords&quot;, which barred such lawsuits. After failing in the courts, the former hostages turned to Congress and won support from both Democrats and Republicans, resulting in Congress passing a bill (2015 United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act [USVSST]) in December 2015 that afforded the hostages compensation from a fund to be financed from fines imposed on companies found guilty of breaking American sanctions against Iran. The bill authorised a payment of US$10,000 for each day in captivity (per hostage) as well as a lump sum of $600,000 in compensation for each of the spouses and children of the Iran hostages. This meant that each hostage would be paid up to US$4.4 million. The first funds into the trust account from which the compensation would be paid came from a part of the $9 billion penalty paid by the Paris-based bank BNP Paribas for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan.

Some of the ex-hostages and their families received payments, but then Justice Department lawyers interpreted the law to allow 9/11 family members to get a judgment against Iran as well and to apply to the USVSST fund. Later, victims of the 1983 Beirut bombings also instituted claims against USVSST fund. Due to depletion of the fund, by February 2019, only 17.8% of the legislated amount had been paid to the freed hostages and their direct families.

===Notable hostage-takers, guards, and interrogators===

* Abbas Abdi – reformist, journalist, self-taught sociologist, and social activist.
* Hamid Aboutalebi – former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations.
* Ebrahim Asgharzadeh – then a student; later an Iranian political activist and politician, member of Parliament (1989–1993), and chairman of City Council of Tehran (1999–2003).
* Mohsen Mirdamadi – member of Parliament (2000–2004), head of Islamic Iran Participation Front.
* Masoumeh Ebtekar – interpreter and spokeswoman for the student group that occupied the embassy; later a scientist, journalist, first female Vice President of Iran, and head of Environment Protection Organization of Iran.
* Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha – spiritual leader of the hostage-takers.
* Hossein Sheikholeslam – then a student; later a member of Parliament and Iranian ambassador to Syria, died during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

==October Surprise theory==
The timing of the release of the hostages gave rise to allegations that representatives of Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the 1980 United States presidential election to thwart Carter from pulling off an &quot;October surprise&quot;. In 1992, Gary Sick, the former national security adviser to Ford and Carter, presented the strongest accusations in an editorial that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and others, including former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr, repeated and added to them. This alleged plot to influence the outcome of the 1980 United States presidential election between Carter and Reagan became known as the 1980 October Surprise theory.

After twelve years of varying media attention, both houses of the United States Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that credible evidence supporting the allegation was absent or insufficient.

In May 2023, Sick, former Carter administration Chief Domestic Policy Advisor Stuart E. Eizenstat, author Kai Bird, and journalist Jonathan Alter published an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; outlining the various allegations and circumstantial evidence (including Barnes&#x27; allegations in &quot;The New York Times&quot;) that have emerged in the decades following the earlier investigations, declaring the credibility of the theory to be &quot;all but settled.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Over 80 songs which are about the Iran hostage crisis or contain references to it have been released.
* Laurie Anderson&#x27;s surprise 1982 UK #2 hit &quot;O Superman&quot; was a response to the crisis, and to Operation Eagle Claw in particular.
* The 1982 international hit &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; by A Flock of Seagulls does not actually refer to the crisis, but as Dave Thompson has said, the song was &quot;punningly political&quot; to American listeners.

The 2012 Hollywood film &quot;Argo,&quot; which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, was based on the Canadian Caper rescue.

In 2022, HBO released a 4-part documentary series titled &quot;Hostages&quot;.

<text>Aldershot Football Club was a football club from Aldershot, Hampshire, England, that played in the English Football League from 1932 to 1992. The club was nicknamed &quot;The Shots&quot; for both the last syllable of the town name and the military links to the town. They played home games at the Recreation Ground throughout their history.

Founded as Aldershot Town in 1926, they joined the Southern League the following year and were crowned champions in 1929–30. They were elected into the Football League Third Division South in 1932, where they would remain until becoming founder members of the Fourth Division in 1958. Promotion was secured at the end of the 1972–73 season, though they were relegated in 1976. Aldershot were the first ever winners of a Football League play-off competition, when they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Fourth Division play-offs in 1987. However, they were relegated from the Third Division after just two seasons. They became the first Football League club in 30 years to resign from the League during the course of a season; the club was wound up in the High Court in March 1992. In response to the bankruptcy a group of supporters set up a new club, Aldershot Town, which still plays at the Recreation Ground.

== History ==

=== Non-League years: 1926–1932 ===
The club was founded in 1926 as Aldershot Town FC when Jack White, a sports journalist persuaded council officials that the garrison town needed a professional football club. In 1927 the club joined the Southern League, playing their first game on 27 August 1927 in a 4–0 win over Grays Athletic in front of a 3,500-strong crowd at the Recreation Ground. They finished their first season in seventh place, and in 1932 won the Southern League title, being elected to the Football League in place of Thames who had declined to apply for re-election. The name was changed to Aldershot prior to their inaugural 1932–33 League season.

=== Early league years: 1932–1958 ===
Aldershot&#x27;s first Football League season ended with a 17th place in the Third Division South, and a year later they improved slightly to finish 14th. They failed to make much of an impact in the league until they finished 11th in 1935–36, but in 1936–37 they finished bottom of the league and had to apply for re-election in order to avoid slipping back into the Southern League. Good progress over the next two seasons saw them climb to 10th in the league in the 1939 final table. Their 18th-place finish in 1958 meant that they would play in the new Football League Fourth Division in the 1958–59 season, following a restructuring of the Football League which saw an end to the regionalised two sections of the Third Division.

=== The Fourth Division years: 1958–1973 ===
Aldershot F.C. were among the founder members of the Fourth Division in the 1958–59 season. An FA Cup match against Carlisle United on 28 January 1970 saw Aldershot&#x27;s record attendance of 19,138.

They finished 22nd in the first season of the Fourth Division and once again had to apply for re-election.

Promotion to the Third Division was finally achieved in 1973, their first promotion in 41 years of league football. They went up in fourth place after finishing ahead of Newport County on goal average.

=== The Third Division years: 1973–1976 ===
1973–74 brought Aldershot&#x27;s highest-ever finish as they came eighth in the Third Division. This gave hope that Aldershot could soon be playing Second Division football – this was all the more anticipated as the mid to late 1970s saw several big clubs – including Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Nottingham Forest, Chelsea and Newcastle United – playing at least one season in the second tier. However, it was not to be, as Aldershot finished 20th in the Third Division in 1975 and only avoided relegation on goal average. They were relegated by a single point the following year.

=== Back in the Fourth Division: 1976–1985 ===
Two years after relegation, Aldershot almost returned to the Third Division in 1978, but were pipped to promotion by Brentford. More significantly, they were also pipped to promotion by Watford and Swansea City, who were both playing top-division football within the next five years. A similar disappointment followed a year later, as they were pipped to promotion by a single place – this time by a Wimbledon side who were First Division members and FA Cup winners less than a decade later. On the plus side, Aldershot finished above two much more illustrious clubs – Portsmouth and Huddersfield Town – who were both former winners of the league title and FA Cup.

In 1981, Aldershot suffered their third promotion disappointment in four seasons as they finished sixth – once again being beaten to a place in the top four by Wimbledon. In the 1981–82 season, Aldershot struggled badly and finished 16th. It was the first season of the Football League&#x27;s &quot;3 points for a win&quot; system, and they finished just eight points outside the &quot;re-election zone&quot;.

They continued to struggle in the Fourth Division, until the appointment of new manager Len Walker in June 1985. However, 1983–84 had brought a brief respite, as Aldershot finished fifth, before another setback saw them finish 13th.

In 1984–85, Aldershot took a young striker at the time on loan from Millwall – Teddy Sheringham, the future England international player. Millwall manager George Graham had been willing to sell Sheringham to Aldershot on a permanent basis, but they could not raise the £5,000 fee.

=== The final years: 1985–1992 ===
The arrival of Len Walker as manager in June 1985 sparked a brief revival in Aldershot&#x27;s fortunes. Although they finished 16th in 1985–86 and relegation was a threat right up to the final few games of the season, they emerged as strong promotion contenders in the 1986–87 season, finishing sixth on 70 points and occupying the final playoff place in the division. It was the first season of the Football League play-offs, which in their first two seasons operated as a promotion/relegation decider between the First/Second, Second/Third and Third/Fourth divisions before a reorganisation saw them operate solely as promotion deciders. In the semi-finals, they condemned Third Division Bolton Wanderers (four times winners of the FA Cup, and First Division members as recently as 1980) to Fourth Division football for the first time in their history. This gave them a place in the final, against another historic side – Wolverhampton Wanderers, three times league champions, four times FA Cup winners, and twice Football League Cup winners, who had only been relegated from the top flight in 1984. Aldershot gave Wolves one of the most humiliating defeats of their history by winning 3–0 on aggregate over two legs.

Aldershot were predicted to go straight back down to the Fourth Division in 1987–88, but managed to avoid automatic relegation by two places and three points, finishing one point and one place ahead of the relegation play-off place.

However, a disastrous season in 1988–89 saw Aldershot go down in bottom place with just eight wins and 37 points all season placing them 17 points adrift of safety.

By this stage, a financial crisis was dawning upon the club as debts were mounting and as the 1989–90 season began, the task at Aldershot was to avoid being relegated or expelled from the Football League, rather than mounting a promotion challenge. Aldershot finished 22nd in the Fourth Division that season, and were in danger of a second successive relegation right up to the end of April.

However, the financial crisis was worsening and it seemed highly doubtful that Aldershot would be able to start the 1990–91 season.

On 31 July 1990, Aldershot were wound up in the High Court as the Official Receiver condemned them as &quot;hopelessly insolvent&quot; with debts of £495,000. However, the winding-up order was lifted on 7 August 1990 when 19-year-old property developer Spencer Trethewy paid £200,000 to save the club and allow them to start the new Fourth Division campaign. It soon emerged that Trethewy did not have the funds to keep the club running, and he was dismissed from the board on 1 November 1990. Trethewy&#x27;s shady dealings finally caught up with him in 1994 when he was convicted of fraud and received a two-year prison sentence.

Aldershot&#x27;s problems continued as they finished the 1990–91 season second from bottom in the league. They had taken in three new players near the end of the season in the form of Roger Davis, Dion Smith and Steve Batler. These changes came too late in the season to save the Shots from another low finish. There was no relegation this season due to an expansion in the league&#x27;s size to 93 clubs from the previous total of 92.

There was a brief respite for the club on 5 January 1991, when it held West Ham United to a surprise goalless draw in the FA Cup third round at Upton Park. The Hammers won the replay 6–1 and went on to reach the semi-finals, also winning promotion to the First Division that season.

Len Walker had stepped up to the role of general manager in March 1991, with Brian Talbot taking over as player-manager.

However, Aldershot&#x27;s debts were mounting and although they were able to begin the 1991–92 Fourth Division campaign, as the season wore on it looked more and more likely that the club would go under. As well as that, the problems were showing on the field as Aldershot struggled near the foot of the league.

Manager Brian Talbot resigned in November 1991 to be succeeded by Ian McDonald.

On 25 March 1992 Aldershot F.C. finally went out of business and were obliged to resign from the Football League. The final game played was a 2–0 defeat against Cardiff City at Ninian Park on 20 March. The last home game was a 3–0 defeat to Lincoln City, also in the league, on 14 March. Aldershot&#x27;s final eight competitive games all ended in defeat and they had not won any of their final 16 games; their last competitive win was on 28 December 1991 away to Maidstone United in the Fourth Division. Ironically, Maidstone also went out of business and had to leave the Football League just five months after Aldershot&#x27;s demise.

Aldershot&#x27;s league record for the 1991–92 season, which had seen them play 36 games, was expunged.

=== The new Aldershot club: Since 1992 ===
In response to the bankruptcy a group of supporters set up a new club, Aldershot Town, which started in the Isthmian League Division Three, five levels below the division in which Aldershot F.C. had been playing. Aldershot Town were playing in League Two after being promoted on 15 April 2008, but their run came to an end after relegation to Conference Premier on 27 April 2013.

<text>In the Solar System, a planet is said to be inferior or interior with respect to another planet if its orbit lies inside the other planet&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. In this situation, the latter planet is said to be superior to the former. In the reference frame of the Earth, where the terms were originally used, the inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, while the superior planets are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Dwarf planets like Ceres or Pluto and most asteroids are &#x27;superior&#x27; in the sense that they almost all orbit outside the orbit of Earth.

== History ==
These terms were originally used in the geocentric cosmology of Claudius Ptolemy to differentiate as inferior those planets (Mercury and Venus) whose epicycle remained co-linear with the Earth and Sun, and as superior those planets (Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) that did not.

In the 16th century, the terms were modified by Copernicus, who rejected Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric model, to distinguish a planet&#x27;s orbit&#x27;s size in relation to the Earth&#x27;s.

==Planets in each category==
When Earth is stated or assumed to be the reference point: 
*&quot;Inferior planet&quot; refers to Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the Sun than Earth is.
*&quot;Superior planet&quot; refers to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (the latter two added later), which are further from the Sun than Earth is.

The terms are sometimes used more generally; for example, Earth is an inferior planet relative to Mars.

== Other planetary terms ==
Interior planet now seems to be the preferred term for astronomers. Inferior/interior and superior are different from the terms inner planet and outer planet, which designate those planets that lie inside the asteroid belt and those that lie outside it, respectively. Inferior planet is also different from minor planet or dwarf planet. Superior planet is also different from gas giant.

<text>The gens Valeria was a patrician family at ancient Rome, prominent from the very beginning of the Republic to the latest period of the Empire. Publius Valerius Poplicola was one of the consuls in 509 BC, the year that saw the overthrow of the Tarquins, and the members of his family were among the most celebrated statesmen and generals at the beginning of the Republic. Over the next ten centuries, few gentes produced as many distinguished men, and at every period the name of &quot;Valerius&quot; was constantly to be found in the lists of annual magistrates, and held in the highest honour. Several of the emperors claimed descent from the Valerii, whose name they bore as part of their official nomenclature.

A number of unusual privileges attached to this family, including the right to burial within the city walls, and a special place for its members in the Circus Maximus, where the unique honour of a throne was granted them. The house built by Poplicola at the foot of the Velian Hill was the only one whose doors were permitted to open into the street. The historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr conjectured that, during the transition from the monarchy to the Republic, the Valerii were entitled to exercise royal power on behalf of the Titienses, one of the three Romulean tribes that made up the Roman people.

Although one of the most noble and illustrious families of the Roman aristocracy, from the very beginning the Valerii were notable for their advocacy of plebeian causes, and many important laws protecting the rights of the plebeians were sponsored by the Valerii. As with many other ancient patrician houses, the family also acquired plebeian branches, which must have been descended either from freedmen of the Valerii, or from members of the family who, for one reason or another, had gone over to the plebeians.

==Origin==
According to tradition, the Valerii were of Sabine descent, having come to Rome with Titus Tatius, shortly after the founding of the city. However, their nomen, &quot;Valerius&quot;, is a patronymic surname derived from the Latin praenomen &quot;Volesus&quot; or &quot;Volusus&quot;, which in turn is derived from , to be strong. Volesus, or Volesus Valerius, the eponymous ancestor of the gens, is said to have been a powerful warrior in the retinue of the Sabine king. Several generations later, another Volesus Valerius was the father of Publius, Marcus, and Manius, three brothers from whom the oldest branches of the family claimed descent.

==Praenomina==
The earliest of the Valerii known to history bore the praenomen &quot;Volesus&quot;, which continued to enjoy occasional use among the Valerii of the early Republic. However, most &quot;stirpes&quot; of the Valerii favoured &quot;Publius, Marcus, Manius&quot;, and &quot;Lucius&quot;. Several branches of the family also used &quot;Gaius&quot;, while the Valerii Faltones employed &quot;Quintus&quot;, and the Valerii Asiatici of imperial times used &quot;Decimus&quot;. Other names are seldom found among the Valerii, although in one instance &quot;Potitus&quot;, an ancient surname of the gens, was revived as a praenomen by the Valerii Messallae during the first century. Examples of &quot;Aulus&quot;, &quot;Numerius&quot;, &quot;Sextus&quot;, &quot;Tiberius&quot;, and &quot;Titus&quot; are found in inscriptions.

==Branches and cognomina==
The oldest branches of the Valerii bore the surnames &quot;Poplicola, Potitus&quot;, and &quot;Maximus&quot;, with &quot;Volusus&quot; being used by the first generations of the &quot;Potiti&quot; and &quot;Maximi&quot;. Later families bore various cognomina, including &quot;Corvus&quot; or &quot;Corvinus, Falto, Flaccus, Laevinus, Messalla, Tappo&quot;, and &quot;Triarius&quot;. Most other surnames found in Republican times belonged to freedmen or clientes of the Valerii. The surnames &quot;Acisculus, Catullus, Flaccus&quot;, and &quot;Barbatus&quot; appear on coins. A few Valerii are known without any cognomina, but they achieved little of significance.

&quot;Poplicola&quot;, also found as &quot;Publicola&quot; and &quot;Poplicula&quot;, belongs to a class of surnames referring to the character of the bearer. Derived from and , the name might best be explained as &quot;one who courts the people.&quot; The cognomen first appears in history as the surname given to Publius Valerius, one of the consuls chosen in 509 BC to serve alongside Lucius Junius Brutus. Despite his patrician background, he made a considerable effort to win the support of the plebeians, averting a breach between the two orders at the inception of the Republic. &quot;Poplicola&quot; seems to have been the original form, while in inscriptions &quot;Publicola&quot; is more common, and &quot;Poplicula&quot; is occasionally found. &quot;Publicola&quot; is found in literary sources from the end of the Republic, including Livy and Cicero.

The Valerii Potiti were descended from Marcus Valerius Volusus, the brother of Poplicola, who fell in battle at Lake Regillus. The surname &quot;Potitus&quot; seems to be derived from , to place someone under one&#x27;s power, and might be translated as &quot;leader&quot;. This family flourished from the early years of the Republic down to the Samnite Wars, when the cognomen seems to have been replaced by &quot;Flaccus&quot;, a surname first borne by one of the Potiti, who must have been flabby or had floppy ears. &quot;Potitus&quot; was later revived as a praenomen by the Valerii Messallae, a practice that was common in aristocratic families toward the end of the Republic. As a distinct family, the Valerii Flacci continued down to the first century AD.

&quot;Maximus&quot;, the superlative of , &quot;great&quot;, was the cognomen of the Valerii descended from the third brother, Manius Valerius Volusus, who first bore the surname. The Valerii Maximi appear in history down to the First Punic War, after which time the surname was replaced by &quot;Messalla&quot; or &quot;Messala&quot;, a cognomen derived from the city of Messana in Sicilia. The first to bear this name received it after relieving Messana from a Carthaginian blockade in 264 BC. The Valerii Messallae held numerous consulships and other high offices in the Roman state, remaining prominent well into imperial times. Some of them had additional surnames, including &quot;Barbatus&quot;, &quot;bearded&quot;, as well as &quot;Niger&quot; and &quot;Rufus&quot;, originally referring to someone with black or red hair. The names &quot;Valerius Maximus&quot; and &quot;Valerius Messalla&quot; occur as late as the third century, but the consular family of that age may have been descended from the Valerii through the female line, and more properly belonged to the Vipstani.

The branch of the Valerii Maximi that gave rise to the Messallae also bore the surname &quot;Corvinus&quot;, a diminutive of , a raven. The first of this family was Marcus Valerius Corvus, who in his youth earned everlasting renown for his combat against a giant Gaul in 349 BC. Corvus defeated his adversary with the help of a raven that repeatedly flew in the barbarian&#x27;s face. He held the consulship six times, was dictator twice, and reached the age of one hundred. The two forms of this surname are interchangeable, but the hero is usually referred to as &quot;Corvus&quot;, while &quot;Corvinus&quot; generally refers to his descendants.

Another branch of the Valerii Maximi bore the surname &quot;Lactucinus&quot;, derived from , lettuce, the cognomen of an early member of the family. Such names, referring to objects, were quite common at Rome. The first of this family was a son of the first Valerius Maximus, but the surname was of brief duration; the last mention of the Valerii Lactucinae is early in the fourth century BC.

The cognomen , meaning &quot;left-handed&quot;, belonged to a family of the Valerii that was prominent for about a century, beginning with the Pyrrhic War, in 280 BC. This family may have been another offshoot of the Valerii Maximi, as the surname first appears in connection with the trial of Spurius Cassius Vecellinus in 485 BC. They continued long after they had ceased to have any importance in the Roman state, and the family is mentioned as late as the end of the first century AD.

The Valerii Faltones flourished at the end of the third century BC, first appearing at the end of the First Punic War. Their relationship to the other Valerii is not immediately apparent, as none of the older stirpes of the gens used the praenomen &quot;Quintus&quot;, but they may have been a cadet branch of the Valerii Maximi, whose surname disappears around this time. The surname &quot;Falto&quot; is another form of , referring to a falcon, and was commonly given to someone with inward-pointing toes, resembling talons.

The plebeian Valerii Triarii belong to the time of Cicero, in the first century BC. None of them rose higher than the rank of praetor, and the family was of brief duration. Their surname, &quot;Triarius&quot;, seems to allude to their military service; in the Roman army of this period, a was a soldier of the third rank, the heavily armed reserve infantry, often consisting of older, wealthier men, and the last line of defense in battle.

&quot;Catullus&quot; seems to be another orthography of , a surname of the Lutatia gens, referring to a whelp, cub, or puppy. The Valerii Catulli appear in the first century BC, beginning with the renowned poet, and their surname continued through the first century of the Empire. One of the Catulli bore the additional surname of &quot;Messalinus&quot;, previously associated with the Valerii Messallae, but it is unclear whether the Catulli were descended from the Messallae, or whether the surname entered the family at a later time. The pairing of &quot;Catullus Messalinus&quot; was also borne by one of the Valerii Asiatici, but again the nature of the relationship between these families is unknown.

&quot;Asiaticus&quot;, the surname of the only major family of the Valerian gens to emerge in imperial times, belongs to a class of cognomina typically derived from the locations of military exploits. In this instance the source of the name is not apparent, although it might allude to some connection with the Cornelii Scipiones; Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus was the younger brother of Scipio Africanus, and his surname was passed down in his family for several generations. The Valerii Asiatici were closely connected with the imperial family from the time of Caligula to that of Hadrian, and accounted for several consulships.

<text>In astronomy, a transit (or astronomical transit) is the passage of a celestial body directly between a larger body and the observer. As viewed from a particular vantage point, the transiting body appears to move across the face of the larger body, covering a small portion of it.

The word &quot;transit&quot; refers to cases where the nearer object appears smaller than the more distant object. Cases where the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object are known as &quot;occultations&quot;.

However, the probability of seeing a transiting planet is low because it is dependent on the alignment of the three objects in a nearly perfectly straight line. Many parameters of a planet and its parent star can be determined based on the transit.

== In the Solar System ==

One type of transit involves the motion of a planet between a terrestrial observer and the Sun. This can happen only with inferior planets, namely Mercury and Venus (see transit of Mercury and transit of Venus). However, because a transit is dependent on the point of observation, the Earth itself transits the Sun if observed from Mars. In the solar transit by the Moon captured during calibration of the STEREO B spacecraft&#x27;s ultraviolet imaging, the Moon appears much smaller than it does when seen from Earth, because the spacecraft–Moon separation was several times greater than the Earth–Moon distance.

The term can also be used to describe the motion of a satellite across its parent planet, for instance one of the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) across Jupiter, as seen from Earth.

Although rare, cases where four bodies are lined up do happen. One of these events occurred on 27 June 1586, when Mercury transited the Sun as seen from Venus at the same time as a transit of Mercury from Saturn and a transit of Venus from Saturn. 

=== Notable observations ===
No missions were planned to coincide with the transit of Earth visible from Mars on 11 May 1984 and the Viking missions had been terminated a year previously. Consequently, the next opportunity to observe such an alignment will be in 2084.

On 21 December 2012, the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; probe, in orbit around Saturn, observed the planet Venus transiting the Sun.

On 3 June 2014, the Mars rover &quot;Curiosity&quot; observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.

=== Mutual planetary transits ===

In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears smaller than the more distant one, the event is called a &quot;mutual planetary transit&quot;.

== Outside the Solar System ==


The transit method can be used to discover exoplanets. As a planet eclipses/transits its host star it will block a portion of the light from the star. If the planet transits in-between the star and the observer the change in light can be measured to construct a light curve. Light curves are measured with a charge-coupled device. The light curve of a star can disclose several physical characteristics of the planet and star, such as density. Multiple transit events must be measured to determine the characteristics which tend to occur at regular intervals. Multiple planets orbiting the same host star can cause transit-timing variations (TTV). TTV is caused by the gravitational forces of all orbiting bodies acting upon each other. The probability of seeing a transit from Earth is low, however. The probability is given by the following equation.

:formula_1

where &quot;R&quot;star and &quot;R&quot;planet are the radius of the star and planet, respectively, and &quot;a&quot; is the semi-major axis. Because of the low probability of a transit in any specific system, large selections of the sky must be regularly observed in order to see a transit. Hot Jupiters are more likely to be seen because of their larger radius and short semi-major axis. In order to find Earth-sized planets, red dwarf stars are observed because of their small radius. Even though transiting has a low probability it has proven itself to be a good technique for discovering exoplanets.

In recent years, the discovery of extrasolar planets has prompted interest in the possibility of detecting their transits across their own stellar primaries. HD 209458b was the first such transiting planet to be detected.

The transit of celestial objects is one of the few key phenomena used today for the study of exoplanetary systems. Today, transit photometry is the leading form of exoplanet discovery. As an exoplanet moves in front of its host star there is a dimming in the luminosity of the host star that can be measured. Larger planets make the dip in luminosity more noticeable and easier to detect. Followup observations using other methods are often carried out to ensure it is a planet.

There are currently (December 2018) 2345 planets confirmed with Kepler light curves for stellar host.

== Contacts ==
During a transit there are four &quot;contacts&quot;, when the circumference of the small circle (small body disk) touches the circumference of the large circle (large body disk) at a single point. Historically, measuring the precise time of each point of contact was one of the most accurate ways to determine the positions of astronomical bodies. The contacts happen in the following order:

*First contact: the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving inward (&quot;exterior ingress&quot;)
*Second contact: the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving further inward (&quot;interior ingress&quot;)
*Third contact: the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving outward (&quot;interior egress&quot;)
*Fourth contact: the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving outward (&quot;exterior egress&quot;)

A fifth named point is that of greatest transit, when the apparent centers of the two bodies are nearest to each other, halfway through the transit.

== Missions ==
Since transit photometry allows for scanning large celestial areas with a simple procedure, it has been the most popular and successful form of finding exoplanets in the past decade and includes many projects, some of which have already been retired, others in use today, and some in progress of being planned and created. The most successful projects include HATNet, KELT, Kepler, and WASP, and some new and developmental stage missions such as TESS, HATPI, and others which can be found among the List of Exoplanet Search Projects.

=== HATNet ===
HATNet Project is a set of northern telescopes in Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, Arizona and Mauna Kea Observatories, HI, and southern telescopes around the globe, in Africa, Australia, and South America, under the HATSouth branch of the project. These are small aperture telescopes, just like KELT, and look at a wide field which allows them to scan a large area of the sky for possible transiting planets. In addition, their multitude and spread around the world allows for 24/7 observation of the sky so that more short-period transits can be caught.

A third sub-project, HATPI, is currently under construction and will survey most of the night sky seen from its location in Chile.

=== KELT ===
KELT is a terrestrial telescope mission designed to search for transiting systems of planets of magnitude 8&lt;M&lt;10. It began operation in October 2004 in Winer Observatory and has a southern companion telescope added in 2009. KELT North observes &quot;26-degree wide strip of sky that is overhead from North America during the year&quot;, while KELT South observes single target areas of the size 26 by 26 degrees. Both telescopes can detect and identify transit events as small as a 1% flux dip, which allows for detection of planetary systems similar to those in our planetary system.

=== Kepler / K2 ===

The Kepler space telescope served the Kepler mission between 7 March 2009 and 11 May 2013, where it observed one part of the sky in search of transiting planets within a 115 square degrees of the sky around the Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco constellations. After that, the satellite continued operating until 15 November 2018, this time changing its field along the ecliptic to a new area roughly every 75 days due to reaction wheel failure.

=== TESS ===

TESS was launched on 18 April 2018, and is planned to survey most of the sky by observing it strips defined along the right ascension lines for 27 days each. Each area surveyed is 27 by 90 degrees. Because of the positioning of sections, the area near TESS&#x27;s rotational axis will be surveyed for up to 1 year, allowing for the identification of planetary systems with longer orbital periods.

<text>Uraniborg was an astronomical observatory and alchemy laboratory established and operated by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, and the last to be built without a telescope as its primary instrument. 

Uraniborg was built on Ven, an island in the Øresund between Zealand and Scania, Sweden, which was part of Denmark at the time. It was expanded with the underground facility Stjerneborg () on an adjacent site.

Brahe also innovated and invented many precision instruments which he used to carry out his studies in the observatory. Research was done in the fields of astronomy, alchemy, and meteorology by Tycho and his assistants.

Brahe abandoned Uraniborg and Stjerneborg in 1597 after he fell out of favour with the Danish king, Christian IV of Denmark; Brahe left the country, and the institution was destroyed in 1601 after his death. Ven was later lost to Sweden, and the Rundetårn (Round Tower) in Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1642 as a replacement for Uraniborg&#x27;s astronomical functions. Restoration of Uraniborg&#x27;s grounds began in 1985.

==History==
The building was dedicated to Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, and it was named Uraniborg, &quot;The Castle of Urania&quot;. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, and the last to be built without a telescope as its primary instrument. The cornerstone was laid on August 8, 1576.

The sandstone and limestone-framed brick building was constructed from the year 1576 to 1580. Built in the Flemish Renaissance style, the erection of the site was overseen by Danish architect Hans van Emden and sculptor Johan Gregor van der Schardt. The main building of Uraniborg was square, about 15 meters on a side, and built mostly of red brick. Two semi-circular towers, one each on the north and south sides of the main building, gave the building a somewhat rectangular footprint overall.

The plan and façade of the building, and also the plan of the surrounding gardens, are designed on grids, with proportions that Tycho carefully specified. These proportions may have been intended to make Uraniborg function as an astrological talisman, benefiting the health of its occupants by increasing the influences of the Sun and Jupiter. The main floor consisted of four rooms, one of which was occupied by Brahe and his family, the other three for visiting astronomers.

The northern tower housed the kitchens, and the southern a library. In this library and within Brahe&#x27;s personal study was etched the motto &quot;Non haberi sed esse,&quot; which translates from Latin to &quot;What one is, is more important than what one is perceived to be.&quot; It serves as a warning to discern perception from reality in pursuit of knowledge. The second floor was divided into three rooms, two of equal size and one larger. The larger room was reserved for visiting royalty; James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) visited on March 20, 1590. 

On this level, the towers housed the primary astronomical instruments, accessed from outside the building or from doors on this floor. Balconies, supported on wooden posts, housed additional instruments slightly further from the building, giving them a wider angle of view. On the third floor was a loft, subdivided into eight smaller rooms for students. Only the roofs of the towers reached this level, although a single additional tower extended above the loft in the middle of the building, similar to a widow&#x27;s walk, accessed via a spiral staircase from the 3rd floor. Uraniborg also featured a large basement. It housed an alchemical laboratory at one end, and storage for food, salt and fuel at the other. Uraniborg contained a small prison room, in order to deal with disorderly tenants or guests.
The observatory had a large mural quadrant affixed to a north–south wall, used to measure the altitude of stars as they passed the meridian. This, along with many other instruments of the observatory, was depicted and described in detail in Brahe&#x27;s 1598 book &quot;Astronomiae instauratae mechanica&quot;.

A large wall, 75 meters on a side and 5.5 meters high, was planned to surround Uraniborg, but was never built; instead, a high earth mound was constructed. That mound has lasted until modern times, being the only remnant of the observatory still in place. Uraniborg was located in the very middle, with an extensive parterre garden between the mound walls and the building. In addition to being decorative, the gardens also supplied herbs for Brahe&#x27;s medicinal chemistry experiments. The gardens are currently being re-created, using seeds found on-site or identified in Brahe&#x27;s writings. At the gatehouses, Tycho incorporated his printing workshop and the island&#x27;s prison.

Extending beyond the walls, Uraniborg&#x27;s surrounding infrastructure included a system of aquaculture ponds, whose overflow powered a paper mill. In 1590 James VI of Scotland gave gold coins to builders and workmen at the paper and corn mills.

Uraniborg&#x27;s construction was a unique phenomenon because it occurred at an interesting point in history. It not only was one of the last observatories built before the development of the telescope, but it was one of the first observatories to be completely funded by a government entity for the purpose of research. Uraniborg was an extremely expensive project and it is estimated that it cost about 1% of the entire state budget during construction.

Upon losing financial support from Frederick II&#x27;s successor, Christian IV of Denmark, Brahe abandoned Ven in 1597. The new king was not a fan of Brahe and due to loss of popularity and funding at court, both astrological sites were destroyed shortly after Brahe&#x27;s death. Stjerneborg was the object of archaeological excavations during the 1950s, resulting in the restoration of the observatory. Stjerneborg now houses a multimedia show.

== Research ==

Uraniborg was a place for the study of astronomy, meteorology, astrology, and alchemy. Over the lifespan of Uraniborg it had upwards of thirty different assistants for Tycho Brahe, and visits from many other researchers and royalty; Martin Zeiler, Nicolaus Reimers, Erik Lange, and David Wunderer being some of the noted visitors. At its best, Brahe&#x27;s data was accurate up to a minute of arc, an improvement of ten times compared to what was previously available.

While tracking the comet of 1577, Brahe saw inaccuracies with the location of stars in both Ptolemy&#x27;s and Copernicus&#x27;s systems. From then Brahe sought a better celestial map. Using both mathematics and observation from Uraniborg, Tycho Brahe released his first model of the celestial night in 1588, the Tychonic system. Brahe&#x27;s system had Earth stationary in the center, the Moon and Sun revolving around it, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolving around the Sun, and the outermost circle where the stars rotate around. Paul Wittich visited Uraniborg for several months in 1580 and aided Brahe in the construction of the Tychonic system. Brahe had also researched meteorology for the King of Denmark, Frederick II, although Brahe did not put his name on the publications.

During the period in which Uraniborg was actively used, astronomy and astrology were thought to be linked to the other scientific fields, and as such the observatory was used to discover more than the astral bodies. Brahe&#x27;s driving force for research at Uraniborg was the desire to make astrology an empirical science and rid it of &quot;mistakes and superstition.&quot; Brahe and his many assistants began charting the positions of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies over time with unprecedented accuracy in this pursuit. While Brahe openly shared his findings in the field of astronomy and meteorology, he did not openly share his work in alchemy. Brahe&#x27;s underground laboratory was designed to allow sunlight in throughout the day and had furnaces arranged so he could do his research even in the coldest months. 

Though he did not publicly publish his findings, he did give them as gifts to other people of power. For example, Brahe allowed Arnold van Langren and Willem Jansz Blaeu, who were prominent Dutch globe makers of the time, access to his and his many assistants&#x27; work. Brahe&#x27;s larger collection of his and his assistants&#x27; work in celestial cartography (a printed version of their star catalogue) was not published for public viewing until the year 1627 by his former assistant and fellow astronomer Johannes Kepler. 

On his deathbed in 1601, Brahe urged Kepler to publish his proprietary Rudolphine Tables on Mars using his own cosmic system as the basis of explanation. Though Kepler did publish the tables as indicated by Brahe, he did so in an effort to endorse the Copernican model of the cosmos that placed the Sun as the center of the universe, in place of the Earth. Additionally, Kepler established the notion of elliptical orbits to replace the antiquated convention of perfectly circular orbits, an artifact of the Aristotelian cosmic system, in his publication.

Jean Picard, known for measuring lines of longitude, revisited the ruins of Uraniborg in 1671. He recorded the longitude and latitude of Uraniborg so astronomers could compare their research to Tycho&#x27;s. Picard also went back to Uraniborg to study atmospheric refraction, which is the bending of light due to the atmosphere.

Shortly after construction it became clear that the tower-mounted instruments were too easily moved by wind, and Brahe set about constructing a more suitable observation site. The result was Stjerneborg (&quot;castle of the stars&quot;), a smaller site built entirely at ground level and dedicated purely to observations (there was no &quot;house&quot;). The basic layout was similar to Uraniborg, with a wall of similar shape surrounding the site, although the enclosed area was much smaller. The instruments were all placed underground, covered by opening shutters or a rotating dome in buildings built over the instrument pits. The research done at Stjerneborg paralleled the work done at Uraniborg but their notes were kept separate so that the research gathered at the observatories could be used to ensure that all of the data was accurate. Work had been started to connect Stjerneburg to Tycho&#x27;s chemistry laboratory under Uraniborg but the tunnel was never completed.

== Instruments ==

The observatory was not just the home of scientists, but it also supported the artisans who constructed the tools that the scientists needed. Tycho Brahe was an innovative astronomer of his time. Within the Uraniborg observatory, he utilized innovative observing methods and built new instruments to improve the accuracy of his readings. Brahe&#x27;s goal to gather accurate data on the cosmos influenced the creation of a wide range of contraptions to prove his theories on the celestial positions and a geo-heliocentric (Tychonic) model of the Solar System, a theory that the Earth is the center of the Sun and Moon while the Sun is also the center of the other planets.

He upsized his instruments; one of the surviving instruments is the Brass Azimuthal Quadrant created in 1576. Instead of using wood as with previous models, he built the new one out of metal and masonry to enhance its stability and therefore improve the accuracy of his measurements. The azimuthal quadrant was meant to observe the Great Comet of 1577 with an accuracy of 48.8 seconds of an arc. He also used highly refined lenses and optical equipment in conjunction with other instruments, such as sextants and armillary spheres. To increase the accuracy of his readings further, he utilized the equatorial coordinate system instead of the zodiacal coordinate system with his specially designed instruments.

In 1580, Brahe created the Great Globe, a hollow, wooden sphere layered with brass plates to document the stars and planets he observed. By 1595, over 1,000 stars had been etched onto the globe. 777 of these were placed over the majority of Brahe&#x27;s time at Uraniborg, and the last 223 just before he left. He and his assistants also tracked the movements of the planets over two decades. 

In 1582, Brahe created the Triangular Sextant. This device was around 3.2 meters in diameter and was fixed in one place instead of being mobile like the smaller versions.

In 1585, Brahe created a larger instrument called the Great Equatorial Armillary, which allowed him to gauge planetary and stellar positions. This device was able to compensate for atmospheric refraction and it remained consistent with its measurements over time. This device was used extensively by Brahe in 1587 to further his work on the determination of Martian parallax, which he had previously attempted to calculate in 1582, 1583, and 1585, but without success due to the unavailability of the proper technology. Though scientists have determined in retrospect that Brahe could not have come to a meaningful conclusion due to errors in commonly used refraction tables of the era, the measurements taken by the Great Equatorial Armillary in conjunction with his other instruments led to unprecedented accuracy in his results and calculations.

Additionally, the structure itself and installation of the instruments was innovative for its time and was pivotal in the accuracy of the instruments. For instance, the upgraded mural quadrant, made from metal and stone, was fixed in place as a wall. This allowed for further accuracy in the measurements recorded by Brahe. The other smaller instruments that were more sensitive to interference from the weather were also fixed in place; they were installed in recesses in the ground to provide greater protection from the wind while still having the ability to measure stellar features. The observatory was also designed so that any exposed instruments on the upper levels of the towers were well protected from exposure.

== Restoration ==

In the 1950s, an excavation effort revealed portions of the original Uraniborg structure and the structure of the underground laboratory space Stjerneborg, which was intended to shield Brahe&#x27;s instruments from meteorological interference. Shortly after rediscovery, the external walls of the original place were reconstructed. A proposal was made to start the reconstruction of the original Uraniborg site during the 1980s. Restoration of the surrounding gardens began in 1985 with the goal of replanting of 16th-century garden. Archaeological studies of the plant material were done by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Landskrona Department of Culture in order to determine the plant type and location. 

Later in 1992, a reconstruction plan for around one-quarter of the ramparts was created. This reconstruction plan included details on the ongoing work that also included the investigation of the structures, the plant material, and acquisitions and forms during the 1580s and 1590s. The new site now includes a restored quarter of Brahe&#x27;s original garden with plants and herbs laid out in beds that are also boxed in with a wooden fence. A fruit orchard was also placed within the center of the pavilion. The refurbished structure of Uraniborg and Stjerneborg have been incorporated into the Tycho Brahe Museum. The grounds include stops at the ruined paper mill and the replica lake that once powered the palace laboratory during the time of Tycho Brahe. The Museum is accessible from both Sweden and Denmark by boat.

<text>Sir Peter Frederick Strawson (; 23 November 1919 – 13 February 2006) was an English philosopher who spent most of his career at the University of Oxford. He was the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford from 1968 to 1987. He had previously held the positions of college lecturer and tutorial fellow at University College, Oxford, a college he returned to upon his retirement in 1987, and which provided him with rooms until his death.

Paul Snowdon and Anil Gomes, in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, comment that Strawson &quot;exerted a considerable influence on philosophy, both during his lifetime and, indeed, since his death.&quot;

==Early years==
Strawson was born in Ealing, west London, and brought up in Finchley, north London, by his parents, both of whom were teachers. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s College, Finchley, followed by St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. 

During the Second World War, Strawson served first with the Royal Artillery from 1940, and then with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He was demobilised in 1946, with the rank of captain. 

After his military service, he went initially to the (then) University College of North Wales at Bangor, as an assistant lecturer. After winning the John Locke scholarship in 1946, and the support of Gilbert Ryle, he went to University College, Oxford, initially as a lecturer, and then, from 1948, as a fellow. 

==Philosophical work==
Strawson first became well known with his article &quot;On Referring&quot; (1950), a criticism of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions (see also Definite descriptions) that Russell explained in the famous &quot;On Denoting&quot; article (1905).

In philosophical methodology, there are (at least) two important and interrelated features of Strawson&#x27;s work that are worthy of note. The first is the project of a &#x27;descriptive&#x27; metaphysics, and the second is his notion of a shared conceptual scheme, composed of concepts operated in everyday life. In his book &quot;Individuals&quot; (1959), Strawson attempts to describe various concepts that form an interconnected web, representing (part of) our common, shared, human conceptual scheme. In particular, he examines our conceptions of basic particulars, and how they are variously brought under general spatio-temporal concepts. What makes this a metaphysical project is that it exhibits, in fine detail, the structural features of our thought about the world, and thus precisely delimits how we, humans, think about reality.

Strawson distinguished between &#x27;revisionary&#x27; and &#x27;descriptive metaphysics&#x27;, he wrote: &quot;Descriptive metaphysics is content to describe the actual structure of our thought about the world, revisionary metaphysics is concerned to produce a better structure&quot;. The purpose of the former is to &quot;lay bare the most general features of our conceptual scheme&quot; and to understand structures which do not &quot;readily display itself on the structures of language but lies submerged&quot; by analysing those metaphysical concepts which have always existed. He lists Aristotle and Kant as descriptive and Descartes and Leibniz as revisionary.

Strawson was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1960 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1969 to 1970. He was knighted in 1977, for services to philosophy.

==Personal life==
After serving as a captain in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War II, Strawson married Ann Martin in 1945. They had four children, including the philosopher Galen Strawson.

P. F. Strawson lived in Oxford all his adult life and died in hospital on 13 February 2006 after a short illness. He was the elder brother of Major General John Strawson.

His obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that &quot;Oxford was the world capital of philosophy between 1950 and 1970, and American academics flocked there, rather than the traffic going the other way. That golden age had no greater philosopher than Sir Peter Strawson.&quot;

In its obituary, &quot;The Times&quot; of London described him as a &quot;philosopher of matchless range who made incisive, influential contributions to problems of language and metaphysics&quot;. The author went on to say: 

His portrait was painted by the artists Muli Tang and Daphne Todd.

<doc id="243454" wikidata="Q328703" url="?curid=243454" title="Hug">
<text>A hug is a form of endearment, found in virtually all human communities, in which two or more people put their arms around the neck, back, under the arm-pits or waists of one another and hold each other closely. If more than two people are involved, it may be referred to as a group hug. 

==Etymology==
The origins of the word are unknown, but two hypotheses exist. The first is that the verb &quot;hug&quot;, first used in the 1560s, could be related to the Old Norse word &#x27;, which meant to comfort. The second hypothesis is that the word is related to the German word &#x27;, which means to foster or cherish, and originally meant to enclose with a hedge.

==Characteristics==
A hug, sometimes in association with a kiss, is a form of nonverbal communication. Depending on culture, context and relationship, a hug can indicate familiarity, love, affection, friendship, fraternity, flirting, or sympathy. 

Hugs can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. A hug usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. A non-reciprocal hug may demonstrate a relational problem. 

A hug can range from a brief one-second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the other person, to an extended holding. The length of a hug in any situation is socially and culturally determined. In the case of lovers, and occasionally others, the hips may also be pressed together. The emotionality of the hug can also influence the direction of the hug. 

The direction of hugs generally corresponds with handedness, with right-handed people tending to lead with the right hand, but a heightened emotional state makes it slightly more likely for people to lead with the left hand. This small but significant effect has been attributed to right-hemispheric emotional processing.

==Cultural aspects==
While less common, hugging may be undertaken as part of a ritual or social act in certain social groups. It is a custom in some cultures such as France, Spain and Latin America for male friends to hug (as well as slap each other on the back) in a joyous greeting. A similar hug, usually accompanied by a kiss on the cheek, is also becoming a custom among Western women at meeting or parting. In Portugal and Brazil, it is common, mostly among males, to finish letters and emails with &#x27; or &#x27; (&quot;a hug&quot;, or &quot;hug&quot;) followed by the sender&#x27;s signature. Similar formulas may be used in oral communication. In the Roman Catholic rite of the Holy Mass, a hug may be substituted for a kiss or handshake amid the kiss of peace ritual.

In May 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the hug has become the favorite social greeting when teenagers meet or part these days&quot; in the United States. A number of schools in the United States have issued bans on hugs, which in some cases have resulted in student-led protests against these bans.

A Canadian journalistic investigation in 2015 noted the popularity of the hug in bromance among young francophone adults in Quebec, Canada.

Unlike some other types of physical contact, a hug can be practiced publicly and privately without stigma in many countries, religions and cultures, within families, and also across most age and gender lines, but is generally an indication that people are familiar with each other. Moving from a handshake (or touch-free) relationship to a hug relationship is a sign of a closer friendship.

An unexpected hug can be regarded as an invasion of a person&#x27;s personal space, but if it is reciprocated, it is an indication that it is welcome. Some Western culture commentators advise avoiding hugs at work to prevent uncomfortable moments, especially with people who dislike hugging. Also, a person, especially a child, may caress and hug a doll or stuffed animal. Young children also hug their parents when they feel threatened by an unfamiliar person, although this may be regarded as clinging onto rather than hugging because it demonstrates a need for protection rather than affection.

Some cultures do not use hugging as a sign of affection or love, such as the Himba in Namibia. During the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, it is halal (permissible) for someone to hug one&#x27;s significant other during daylight hours if one has self-control. However, if accompanied by libidinous urges, it is haram (sinful). Hugging between the opposite gender outside the same family is uncommon and often stigmatized in many traditional Islamic communities.

==Health benefits==
Hugging has been proven to have health benefits. One study has even shown that hugs increase levels of oxytocin and reduce blood pressure. Research indicates that a 20-second-or-longer hug releases oxytocin. Hugging can also buffer against the release of the stress hormone cortisol if a romantic partner hug is shared before a stressful situation. This effect was however only observed for women and not for men.

==Group hug==

A group hug involves more than two people embracing each other by wrapping their arms around one another in order to physically express their bond with each other. A group hug has been found to be a useful tool in group therapy to cement a sense of cohesion among the participants after a session, although it may cause discomfort for group members who shy away from physical contact.

==Cuddling==

Cuddling is a related form of physical intimacy in which two people hold one another in each other&#x27;s arms for an extended period of time. Cuddling can be with family members, friends or lovers. Similar to hugging, cuddling is a more affectionate and intimate embrace, normally done for a longer period of time (usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours). In contrast to hugging, which can often be a nonverbal greeting or parting tradition, cuddling is usually shared between two people who are lying down together or sitting somewhere in an intimate manner. Like hugging, cuddling makes the body release oxytocin, which has a variety of effects. In some cities around the United States, cuddling has evolved into a social activity, where individuals gather for the purpose of cuddling.

<text>The Group of Ten (G-10 or G10) refers to the group of countries that agreed to participate in the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), an agreement to provide the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with additional funds to increase its lending ability.

== History ==
The GAB was established in 1962, when the governments of eight International Monetary Fund (IMF) members—Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and the central banks of two others, Germany and Sweden, agreed to make resources available to the IMF with an additional $6 billion of their resources. The additional money was intended to allow the IMF to have increased lending resources.

In 1964, the funds were used by the IMF to rescue the pound sterling. The G-10 grew in 1964 by the association of the eleventh member, Switzerland, then not a member of the IMF, but the name of the group remained the same.

== Activities ==
The GAB enables the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from these eleven industrial countries (or their central banks), under certain circumstances. Specifically, a proposal for calls under the GAB may only be made when a proposal for the establishment of an activation period under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) is not accepted by NAB participants, who number 38 countries, amongst which are the BRICS nations and Middle Eastern powers.

The potential amount of credit available to the IMF under the GAB totals SDR 17bn (about $26bn), with an additional SDR 1.5bn available under an with Saudi Arabia. The GAB was established in 1962 and expanded in 1983 to SDR 17bn, from about SDR 6bn. It has been activated ten times, the last time in 1998. The GAB and the associated credit arrangement with Saudi Arabia have been renewed, without modifications, for a period of five years from December 26, 2013.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) hosts a publications e-library page for the G-10.

<doc id="243459" wikidata="Q1264451" url="?curid=243459" title="Duke of Abercorn">
<text>The title Duke of Abercorn () is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1868 and bestowed upon James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Abercorn. Although the Dukedom is in the Peerage of Ireland, it refers to Abercorn, West Lothian, and the Duke also bears four titles in the Peerage of Scotland and two in the Peerage of Great Britain, and is one of three peers who have titles in those three peerages. The Duke of Abercorn also claims the French title of Duke of Châtellerault, created in 1548.

==History==
In acknowledgement of his loyalty, James VI of Scotland (James I of England), conferred on the Hon. Claud Hamilton, third son of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, the title Lord Paisley. His son James Hamilton was created Lord Abercorn on 5 April 1603, then on 10 July 1606 he was made Earl of Abercorn and Lord of Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastell and Kilpatrick.

His successor, the 2nd Earl of Abercorn, was additionally created Lord Hamilton, Baron of Strabane, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 8 May 1617. He resigned this dignity to his younger brother in 1633; the brother&#x27;s heirs inherited the Earldom and other titles in 1680, in the person of Claud Hamilton, 4th Earl of Abercorn. He was attainted in Ireland in 1691, and the Barony of Strabane forfeited, but his brother Charles Hamilton, 5th Earl of Abercorn, obtained a reversal of the attainder and recovered in 1692.

The 6th earl was at his accession an Irish baronet, &quot;of Dunalong in the County of Tyrone, and of Nenagh in the County of Tipperary&quot; (1660). He was additionally created Baron Mountcastle and Viscount Strabane, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 2 September 1701. The 7th earl became the first of the Earls of Abercorn to be invested a Privy Counsellor, having been appointed to both the English and Irish Privy Councils. The 8th earl was created Viscount Hamilton, of Hamilton, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 24 August 1786. He was succeeded by his nephew, who was created Marquess of Abercorn in the Peerage of Great Britain on 15 October 1790, after having sat in the House of Commons as MP for East Looe and for St Germans. He was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1805.

The 2nd Marquess, who had been given the Garter in 1844, served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1866 to 1868 (and again from 1874 to 1876); and on 10 August 1868, during his first term, he was created Marquess of Hamilton, of Strabane, and Duke of Abercorn (in the Peerage of Ireland). His successor, the 2nd Duke, continued the family tradition by being awarded the Garter in 1892; the 3rd Duke served as MP for Londonderry and as Governor of Northern Ireland, along with being created a Knight of St Patrick and given the Garter. Currently, the holder of the Dukedom is James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Abercorn, also a Knight of the Garter.

Of the subsidiary titles above, Marquess of Hamilton is the courtesy title of the heir apparent, and Viscount Strabane that of his heir-apparent.

The Dukes of Abercorn also claim the French title of &quot;Duc de Châtellerault&quot;, as heirs-male of the 2nd Earl of Arran, who was granted the title in 1548 by Henry II of France. Additionally, since the death of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, in 1651, the Earls, Marquesses, and Dukes of Abercorn have been the rightful claimants to the peerage dignities of Earl of Arran (of the 1503 creation) and Lord Hamilton (of the 1445 creation), both in the Peerage of Scotland, as the most senior heirs-male of James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, and this title is reflected in their coat of arms, with an inescutcheon of three fleurs-de-lys and a French ducal crown.

Diana, Princess of Wales, was a great-granddaughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn.

The family seat is Baronscourt (usually known locally as Baronscourt Castle), a neo-Classical country house on the Barons Court Estate near Newtownstewart, Omagh, a village near Strabane, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Abercorn and their families is the cemetery at Baronscourt Parish Church.

<doc id="243461" wikidata="Q207838" url="?curid=243461" title="Marsh tit">
<text>The marsh tit (Poecile palustris) is a Eurasian passerine bird in the tit family Paridae and genus &quot;Poecile&quot;, closely related to the willow tit, Père David&#x27;s and Songar tits. It is a small bird, around long and weighing , with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail. Between 8 and 11 subspecies are recognised. Its close resemblance to the willow tit can cause identification problems, especially in the United Kingdom where the local subspecies of the two are very similar: they were not recognised as separate species until 1897.

Globally, the marsh tit is classified as Least Concern, although there is evidence of a decline in numbers (in the UK, numbers have dropped by more than 50% since the 1970s, for example). It can be found throughout temperate Europe and northern Asia and, despite its name, it occurs in a range of habitats including dry woodland. The marsh tit is omnivorous; its food includes caterpillars, spiders and seeds. It nests in tree holes, choosing existing hollows to enlarge, rather than excavating its own. A clutch of 5–9 eggs is laid.

==Taxonomy and systematics ==
The marsh tit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Parus palustris&quot;. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Poecile&quot; that was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The genus name, &quot;Poecile&quot;, is the Ancient Greek name for a now unidentifiable small bird, and is perhaps derived from &quot;poikolos&quot;, meaning &quot;spotted&quot;; the specific &quot;palustris&quot; is Latin for &quot;marshy&quot;.

An analysis of mitochrondrial DNA sequences has shown that the marsh tit belongs to a group of Eurasian &#x27;typical chickadees&#x27; that includes the willow tit, Père David&#x27;s tit, the black-bibbed tit, and the Songar tit.

Ten subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;P. p. dresseri&quot; (Stejneger, 1886) – central and southern England, Wales] and west France. Still present in the far south-east of Scotland but in small numbers. Slightly smaller than &quot;palustris&quot; and more brown or olive-coloured on upperparts and dirtier below. Pale brown tertial fringes can sometimes cause confusion with willow tit
* &quot;P. p. palustris&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north and central Europe, from south Scandinavia south to north Iberia, east to central Poland, west Balkans and Greece
* &quot;P. p. italicus&quot; (Tschusi &amp; Hellmayr, 1900) – French Alps, Italy and Sicily. As &quot;dresseri&quot;, but more rufous on upperparts and paler on underparts In Sicily, it was described the subspecies siculus (De Burg, 1925) considered synonymic with italicus by Vaurie (1959), and subsequently forgotten by most authors. However, in a typical cline pale-dark/north-south all over Europe, and along the Italian peninsula too, where darkest birds are in the Alpine area and palest (as pale as nominate subsp.) in Calabria, the Sicilian very isolated and relict population is composed by the smallest and darkest birds in Europe, therefore rather out of the clinal gradient/intergrade populations. It should deserve better and in depth study before being in synonymized (Priolo, 1969; Corso, 2005; A.Corso, pers. obs.) 
* &quot;P. p. stagnatilis&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1855) – east Europe east to south Urals and northwest Turkey
* &quot;P. p. kabardensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1929) – Caucasus and northeast Turkey
* &quot;P. p. brevirostris&quot; Taczanowski, 1872 – south central &amp; southeast Siberia, north Mongolia, northeast China and North Korea
* &quot;P. p. ernsti&quot; (Yamashina, 1933) – Sakhalin Island
* &quot;P. p. hensoni&quot; (Stejneger, 1892) – south Kuril Islands and Hokkaido, Japan
* &quot;P. p. jeholicus&quot; (Kleinschmidt, O &amp; Weigold, 1922) – northeast China and North Korea
* &quot;P. p. hellmayri&quot; Bianchi, 1903 – east China and South Korea

==Description==

The nominate race has a black cap and nape with a blue sheen visible at close quarters. The black &#x27;bib&#x27; below the bill is rather small; the cheeks are white, turning dusky brown on the ear coverts. The upperparts, tail and wings are greyish-brown, with slightly paler fringes to the tertials. The underparts are off-white with a buff or brown tinge strongest on the flanks and undertail coverts. The bill is black and the legs dark grey. Juveniles are very similar to adults, but with a duller black cap and bib, more greyish upperparts and paler underparts; they moult into adult plumage by September.

The marsh tit weighs , has a length of (from bill to tail) and a wingspan of . The wing length ranges from . The oldest recorded marsh tit in Europe reached the age of 11 years, 11 months.

Like other tits it has a large range of call notes; most typical is the explosive &quot;pitchou&quot; note, given when agitated, often leading into &quot;pitchou-bee-bee-bee&quot;, which can sound like willow tit when not heard clearly. Unlike many other tits, however, the marsh tit has a well-defined song and a wide song repertoire. Individual birds can have more than five songs, which they use interchangeably. Some of the more common songs include a typical tit-like, ringing, &quot;schip-schip-schip-schip-ship&quot;, a more liquid &quot;tu-tu-tu-tu-tu&quot; and sometimes a sweet &quot;tyeu-tyeu-tyeu-tyeu-tyeu&quot;. The old Staffordshire name for the species, &#x27;Saw Whetter&#x27;, refers to the bird&#x27;s scolding call.

Marsh and willow tits are difficult to distinguish on appearance alone; the races occurring in the UK (&quot;P. p. dresseri&quot; and &quot;P. m. kleinschmidti&quot; respectively) are especially hard to separate. When caught for ringing, the pale &#x27;cutting edge&#x27; of the marsh tit&#x27;s bill is a reliable criterion; otherwise, the best way to tell apart the two species is by voice. Plumage characteristics include the lack of a pale wing panel (formed by pale edges to the secondary feathers in the willow tit), the marsh tit&#x27;s glossier black cap and smaller black &#x27;bib&#x27;, although none of these is &#x27;completely reliable&#x27;; for example, juvenile marsh tits can show a pale wing panel. The marsh tit has a noticeably smaller and shorter head than the willow tit and overall the markings are crisp and neat, with the head in proportion to the rest of the bird (willow tit gives the impression of being &#x27;bull-necked&#x27;).

A measure of the difficulty in identification is given by the fact that, in the UK, the willow tit was not identified as distinct from marsh tit until 1897. Two German ornithologists, Ernst Hartert and Otto Kleinschmidt, were studying marsh tit skins at the British Museum and found two wrongly-labelled willow tits amongst them (two willow tit specimens were then collected at Coalfall Wood in Finchley, north London, and that species was added to the British list in 1900).

==Distribution and habitat==
The marsh tit has a worldwide Extent of Occurrence of around 10 million square kilometres. The global population includes between 6.1 million and 12 million birds in Europe alone. The species is classified as Least Concern, though there is some evidence of a decline in numbers. For example, between the 1970s and 2007, marsh tit numbers declined in the United Kingdom by more than 50% and consequently it is on the Red List of species compiled by the UK&#x27;s Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Research suggests that the cause may be low survival rates from year to year, though the nest failure rate has fallen during the decline. Other studies have shown that reduced diversity of woodland structure and plant species, partly because of the impact of deer browsing, is the cause of the bird&#x27;s decline.

Data from 157 woodlands covered by the RSPB/BTO Repeat Woodland Bird Survey showed that the abundance of marsh tits in 2003–2004 corresponded with the vegetation present 2–4 metres above the ground, the shrub layer. Data from the 1980s did not show the same results, but marsh tit numbers had increased by 2003–2004 in woods with the most shrub cover. The study concluded that damage to the shrub layer, caused by overgrazing by deer, for example, may make woodland less suitable for marsh tits.

It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate Europe and northern Asia. It occurs from northern Spain north to south-eastern Scotland and east to western Russia, with a broad gap in western Asia and present again in eastern Asia from the Altai Mountains east to northern Japan and northern and western China.

This species is sedentary, making short post-breeding movements in most of its range, but in northern Europe some move southward in winter. However, marsh tits seem not to perform the occasional irruptions that other members of the tit family do. Most marsh tits stay in their breeding territories year-round; presumably this is related to their food-storing strategy. Analysis of UK ringing data showed that of 108 recoveries (when a ringed bird is found dead or caught by another ringer), 85% were less than 5 km from where the bird was originally caught, and only 1% further than 20 km. Young birds join mixed roaming flocks; adults also join the flocks when they pass through, but do not stray from their territory.

Marsh tits breed mostly in lowland areas, but can reach altitudes of up to 1,300 m. They prefer large areas of moist, broadleaved woodland, often oak or beech, though they can occupy wet alder woodland, riverside trees, parks and gardens or orchards. A study at Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire, England, found that marsh tits required mature trees with a shrub layer below the canopy, but that they avoided parts of the wood with many young trees. Another study in the United Kingdom found that during winter and while foraging, marsh tits spent more time than blue tits in the wood&#x27;s understorey, and more time lower in the woodland canopy and understorey. Trees and shrubs in 10 breeding territories were also compared. The trees varied significantly between territories, but the shrub characteristics did not, suggesting that the shrubs were more important to the birds. In Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, marsh tits were &quot;largely absent&quot; from parts of the wood with a dense canopy but poor shrub cover.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In mixed winter tit flocks, seldom more than one or two marsh tits are present, and parties of this species alone are infrequent. Its performances in the bushes and branches are just as neat and agile as those of other tits; it often hangs upside down by one leg.

===Breeding===
Marsh tits are monogamous and often pair for life; one pair stayed together for six years. In Europe, hybridisation with the willow tit has been recorded twice.

The nest site is in a hole, usually in a tree but sometimes in a wall or in the ground. Nestboxes may be used. Old willow tit holes may be used and enlarged further. Marsh tits do not usually excavate their own nest holes, though they may enlarge the hollow, carrying the chips to a distance before dropping them. The hole may be within a centimetres or two of the ground or high as . Inside the hole, a nest of moss is made and lined with hair and sometimes a few feathers; of moss is used in damp holes, but much less in dry ones.
Between five and nine white and red-speckled eggs are laid late in April or in May, measuring and weighing each, of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female for 14–16 days; incubation begins before the clutch is complete, meaning that the chicks hatch over a period of around two days. She sits closely and gives a typical tit &quot;hissing display&quot; if disturbed. The male helps to feed and care for the young and brings nearly all the food for the first four days after hatching. The altricial, downy chicks fledge after 18–21 days. The fledglings are fed by their parents for a week and become independent after a further 1–7 days. The family stays together for between 11 and 15 days after the first flights of the juveniles. Second broods have been recorded, though they are extremely rare in Britain; most are replacement clutches.

A study of marsh tits in Białowieża Forest, Poland, looked at which factors affected birds&#x27; choice to re-occupy a nest hole used the previous year. It found that 35.5% of available holes were used again the following year, and that holes where a brood had failed were less likely to be re-used. A study in Bourton Woods, Gloucestershire, England, found that nestboxes were used by marsh tits in successive years in only 20% of cases.

===Food and feeding===
Mostly spiders and insects are eaten in spring and summer, but seeds – including those of the thistle – nuts and berries are taken in autumn and winter. Beechmast is the preferred food when it can be found. Marsh tits often take seeds and fruit from the plant before taking them to eat elsewhere.

Marsh tits collect and store large numbers of seeds. For a study in Norway, birds were watched for two hours 15 minutes. They ate 43 and cached 83 seeds per hour. In Sweden, storing food is most frequent between September and late February, with the peak in this behaviour occurring from September to October. Hiding places for the seeds include on and in the ground, in leaf litter, in tree stumps, and under moss and lichen in trees. The hidden seeds are prone to being stolen, by other marsh tits or other species, so birds often fly from one site to another before deciding on a hiding place. They tend to retrieve the oldest items first, and memorise their location rather than searching randomly or checking systematically. The marsh tit&#x27;s hippocampus is 31% bigger than that of the great tit, despite the great tit&#x27;s larger overall size and larger forebrain; the relative volume of this part of the brain is greater in birds that cache food.

<doc id="243467" wikidata="Q791644" url="?curid=243467" title="Beardmore Glacier">
<text>The Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica is one of the largest valley glaciers in the world, being long and having a width of .
It descends about from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf and is bordered by the Commonwealth Range of the Queen Maud Mountains on the eastern side and the Queen Alexandra Range of the Central Transantarctic Mountains on the western.
Its mouth is east of the Lennox-King Glacier.
It is northwest of the Ramsey Glacier.
==Early exploration==

The glacier is one of the main passages through the Transantarctic Mountains to the great polar plateau beyond, and was one of the early routes to the South Pole despite its steep upward incline.

The glacier was discovered and climbed by Ernest Shackleton during his &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition of 1908. Although Shackleton turned back at latitude 88° 23&#x27; S, just from the South Pole, he established the first proven route towards the pole and, in doing so, became the first person to set foot upon the polar plateau. In 1911–1912, Captain Scott and his &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition team reached the South Pole by similarly climbing the Beardmore. However, they reached the pole a month after Roald Amundsen and his team, who had chosen a route up the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier. It was on the way back to the Terra Nova expedition&#x27;s base camp after they left the South Pole that Edgar Evans, one of the members of Scott&#x27;s chosen team to go on to the final trek to the South Pole, died around the foot of Beardmore Glacier on February 17, 1912.

==Name==

Beardmore Glacier was named by Shackleton after Sir William Beardmore, a Scottish industrialist and expedition sponsor. 
However, Ranulph Fiennes writes that Shackleton had previously told Beardmore&#x27;s wife, Elspeth, that he would name a glacier after her and it is possible that is what Shackleton actually did.

==Fossils==
In 2016, the first beetle fossils, in the form of wing-cases (elytra) of the ground beetle &quot;Antarctotrechus&quot;, around 14 to 20 million years old, were found in sediments adjacent to the glacier.

==Head==
Buckley Island separates northern and southern streams at the head of Beardmore Glacier.
The Wild Icefalls cross the northern stream, to the west of Skaar Ridge and Buckley Island.
The Shackleton Icefalls extend across the southern stream, to the south of Mount Darwin and Buckley Island.

===Shackleton Icefalls===
Extensive icefalls of the upper Beardmore Glacier, southward of Mount Darwin and Mount Mills. 
Named by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13 (BrAE) for Sir Ernest Shackleton, leader of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, who first penetrated this region.
===Wild Icefalls===
The extensive icefalls at the head of Beardmore Glacier, between Mount Wild and Mount Buckley. 
Named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1961–62) in association with nearby Mount Wild.

==Left tributaries==
Tributaries from the left (northwest, Queen Alexandra Range) from west to east include Table Bay and Swinford Glacier near the head.
In the central section left tributaries are Berwick Glacier, fed from the left by Moody Glacier, Bingley Glacier, Cherry Icefall, Hewson Glacier and Garrard Glacier.
In the lower section the left tributaries include Alice Glacier, Evans Glacier and Socks Glacier.

===Table Bay===
A small glacier between Mount Augusta and Mount Holloway in the south part of Queen Alexandra Range draining eastward into Beardmore Glacier at Lizard Point. 
Evidently named by the Southern Polar Party of the BrAE (1910–13) because of its appearance. 
The term &quot;Bay&quot; is obviously a misnomer, but it has been retained because of uniform usage for over fifty years.

===Lizard Point===
A low morainic point along the west side of upper Beardmore Glacier, marking the south side of the entrance to glacier-filled Table Bay. 
Named by the BrAE, 1910-13.

===Swinford Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, flowing southeast between Mount Holloway and Marshall Mountains to enter Beardmore Glacier.
Discovered by the BrAE (1907–09) and named by Shackleton for his eldest son, Raymond Swinford. 
The map of the BrAE (1910–13) and some subsequent maps transpose the positions of Swinford Glacier and Berwick Glacier. 
The latter lies northeastward. 
The original appellation (BrAE, 1907–09) of Swinford Glacier is the one recommended. Not: Berwick Glacier.

===Berwick Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, flowing southeast between Marshall Mountains and Adams Mountains to enter Beardmore Glacier at Willey Point. 
Named by BrAE (1907–09) after HMS &quot;Berwick&quot;, a vessel on which Lt. Jameson B. Adams of BrAE had served. 
The map of the BrAE (1910–13) and some subsequent maps transpose the positions of Berwick Glacier and Swinford Glacier. 
The latter lies south westward. 
The original appellation (BrAE, 1907–09) of Berwick Glacier is the one recommended. Not: Swinford Glacier.

===Moody Glacier===
A glacier between Martin Ridge and Adams Mountains in the Queen Alexandra Range, draining south into Berwick Glacier. 
Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Construction Electrician P.R. Moody, United States Navy, at McMurdo Station, winter 1963.

===Bingley Glacier===
A glacier long in Queen Alexandra Range, draining south from the slopes of Mount Kirkpatrick, Mount Dickerson and Barnes Peak and entering Beardmore Glacier just north of Adams Mountains.
Named by E.H. Shackleton (BrAE, 1907–09) after Bingley, England, the ancestral home of the Shackleton family.

===Cherry Icefall===
A small, steep icefall on the south side, of Barnes Peak in Queen Alexandra Range, descending toward Beardmore Glacier. 
Originally named &quot;Cherry Glacier&quot; by the BrAE (1910–13), for Apsley Cherry-Garrard, zoologist with the expedition. 
The name has been amended on the recommendation of the NZGSAE (1961–62) to be more descriptive of the feature. Not: Cherry Glacier.

===Hewson Glacier===
A glacier in the Queen Alexandra Range, long, flowing northeast to enter Beardmore Glacier just north of The Cloudmaker. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961–62) for Ronald Hewson, surveyor with the expedition.

===Garrard Glacier===

A glacier in Queen Alexandra Range, draining eastward from the névé between Mount Lockwood and Mount Kirkpatrick and entering Beardmore Glacier soouth of Bell Bluff.
It appears that BrAE (1910–13) applied the name &quot;Garrard Glacier&quot; to the feature which had been named Bingley Glacier by Shackleton in 1908. 
The area was surveyed by NZGSAE (1961–62), who retained Bingley Glacier on the basis of priority and reapplied the name Garrard Glacier to this previously unnamed feature. 
Named for Apsley Cherry-Garrard, zoologist with BrAE (1910-13).

===Alice Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, flowing east from the Queen Alexandra Range to enter Beardmore Glacier at Sirohi Point.
Discovered by BrAE (1907–09) and named for the mother of Dr. Eric Marshall, a member of Shackleton&#x27;s South Polar Party.

===Evans Glacier===
A tributary glacier just south of Owen Hills, flowing east from the Queen Alexandra Range into Beardmore Glacier. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961–62) for Petty Officer Edgar Evans, a member of Scott&#x27;s South Pole Party of the BrAE (1910-13), who died near here.

===Socks Glacier===
A small glacier descending the east slopes of Queen Alexandra Range just north of Owen Hills to enter the west side of Beardmore Glacier. 
Discovered by the BrAE (1907–09) and named for one of the ponies taken with the South Pole Party. 
Socks, the last pony to survive the journey, fell into a crevasse on Dec. 7, 1908, on Beardmore Glacier near Socks Glacier.

==Right tributaries==
Tributaries from the right (southeast, Queen Maud Mountains), just below the head of the Beardmore Glacier, are the large Mill Glacier and the large Keltie Glacier, then the smaller Osicki Glacier and Ludeman Glacier.

===Mill Glacier===
A tributary glacier, wide, flowing northwest between the Dominion Range and the Supporters Range into Beardmore Glacier. 
Discovered by the BrAE (1907–09) and named for Hugh Robert Mill, British geographer and Antarctic historian.
The Mill Glacier flowing from the southeast converges with the Beardmore Glacier flowing from the southwest below Plunket Point, the northernmost extreme of the Meyer Desert.
The Mill Glacier is fed from the right by the Mill Stream Glacier, which in turn is fed by the Burgess Glacier.
Above this point on the Mill Glacier are the Scott Icefalls.

===Keltie Glacier===
A large glacier, long, draining from Pain Névé southwest around the southern extremity of Commonwealth Range, and then northwest to enter Beardmore Glacier at Ranfurly Point. 
Discovered by the BrAE (1907–09) who named it for Sir John Scott Keltie, Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, 1892-1915.

===Osicki Glacier===
A narrow, deeply entrenched glacier just south of Mount Deakin in the Commonwealth Range, flowing west into Beardmore Glacier.
Named by US-AC AN for Kenneth J. Osicki, USARP biologist at McMurdo Station, 1963.

===Ludeman Glacier===
A valley glacier, long, flowing north through the Commonwealth Range to enter the east side of Beardmore Glacier at a point north of Mount Donaldson. 
Named by US-ACAN for Lt. Cdr. Emmert E. Ludeman, USN, officer in charge at the Naval Air Facility, McMurdo Sound, 1958.

==Mouth==
===The Gateway===
A low snow-filled pass between Cape Allen and Mount Hope at the northeast extremity of Queen Alexandra Range, affording passage from Ross Ice Shelf to the mouth of Beardmore Glacier westward
of Mount Hope. 
Discovered by the Southern Polar Party of the BrAE (1907–09) and so named because the pass was used to enter Beardmore Glacier. Not: The Gap.

===Cape Allen===
A bare rock point located southwest of Mount Hope, near the mouth of Beardmore Glacier. 
The point forms the west side of the south approach to The Gateway. 
Discovered by the BrAE (1907–09) and named for Robert Calder Allen of the Franklin Relief Expedition to the Arctic.

===Lands End Nunataks===
Two rock nunataks north-north-west of Airdrop Peak at the north end of Ebony Ridge. 
The nunataks lie at the E side of the terminus of Beardmore Glacier and mark the northern termination of the Commonwealth Range at Ross Ice Shelf. 
The descriptive name was recommended to US-ACAN by John Gunner of the Ohio State University Institute of Polar Studies, who, with Henry H. Brecher, measured a geological section here on Jan. 16, 1970.

<doc id="243468" wikidata="Q56034475" url="?curid=243468" title="The Dreaming (song)">
<text>&quot;The Dreaming&quot; is the title song from Kate Bush&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and was released as a single on 26 July 1982. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; peaked at No. 48 and spent 3 weeks in the UK Singles Chart.

The song is about the destruction of Aboriginal Australians&#x27; traditional lands by white Australians in their quest for weapons-grade uranium. Musical guest Rolf Harris plays the didgeridoo on the recording, and bird impersonator Percy Edwards provided sheep noises. 

The title is based on The Dreaming, a concept in Aboriginal mythology. The original title for the track was &quot;The Abo Song&quot;, which unwittingly made use of a racial slur; promotional 7-inch copies were circulated before being recalled. A 12-inch single was also mooted but ultimately rejected by EMI for &quot;not being commercially viable&quot;.

An alternative version of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, entitled &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, was used as the UK single B-side. It is usually referred to as an instrumental version of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;: while the track omits the sung lead vocals, it retains most of the backing vocals. &quot;Dreamtime&quot; contains both an extended intro and outro.

The cover art is by Del Palmer, Bush&#x27;s partner at the time and sometime bass player. It features a depiction of the Wandjina, a sky spirit in Western Australian traditions.

<doc id="243470" wikidata="Q191096" url="?curid=243470" title="Coal tit">
<text>The coal tit (Periparus ater), is a small passerine bird in the tit family, Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder in forests throughout the temperate to subtropical Palearctic, including North Africa. The black-crested tit is now usually included in this species.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus&#x27; primary reference was his earlier &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot;, whose cumbersome pre-binomial name &quot;Parus capite nigro: vertice albo, dorso cinereo, pectore albo&quot; (&quot;black-headed tit with white nape, ash-grey back, white breast&quot;) became the much simpler yet no less unequivocal &quot;Parus ater&quot;. This name – meaning &quot;dusky-black tit&quot; – was simply adopted from older ornithological textbooks, ultimately going back to Conrad Gessner&#x27;s 1555 &quot;Historia animalium&quot;. He gave no type locality except &quot;Europe&quot;, but his original description refers to the population inhabiting Sweden (which is consequently included in the nominate subspecies today). The current genus name, is Ancient Greek &quot;peri&quot; plus the pre-existing genus &quot;Parus&quot;. The specific &quot;ater&quot; is Latin for &quot;dull black&quot;.
Gessner also notes that the coal tit was known as &quot;Kohlmeiß&quot; in German – the literal equivalent of its English name, though in its modern orthography &quot;Kohlmeise&quot; it refers to the great tit (&quot;Parus major&quot;). That bird was in Gessner&#x27;s day usually called &quot;Spiegelmeiß&quot; (&quot;multicoloured tit&quot;), &quot;Brandtmeiß&quot; (&quot;burnt tit&quot;) or &quot;grosse Meiß&quot; (&quot;great tit&quot;) in German. &quot;Kölmeyß&quot; was attested for &quot;P. major&quot; by William Turner, but Turner does not list &quot;P. ater&quot; at all, while Gessner notes that his hunters always used &quot;Kohlmeiß&quot; for the present species. However, this has since changed, and the modern German name of &quot;P. ater&quot; is &quot;Tannenmeise&quot; (&quot;fir tit&quot;), after a typical habitat. This name is attested (as &quot;Tannen-Maise&quot;) by Johann Leonhard Frisch in the early 18th century already, who furthermore records that &quot;P. ater&quot; was also called &quot;Kleine Kohl-Maise&quot; (&quot;small coal tit&quot;) whereas &quot;Kohl-Maise&quot; referred unequivocally to &quot;P. major&quot;. Frisch collected his data in the Berlin region, where the German dialect was quite different from that spoken by Gessner&#x27;s Alemannic sources 200 years earlier, and heavily influenced by Middle Low German – the language of the northern German sources of Turner. Regarding that, &quot;Tanne&quot; is derived from the Old Saxon &quot;danna&quot;, and thus had spread through the German dialect continuum from north to south. 


In addition, the same data suggest that this species is paraphyletic in regard to the closely related and parapatric spot-winged tit (&quot;P. melanolophus&quot;) from South Asia, which looks like a slightly crested, darker version of &quot;P. ater&quot;. Consequently, the spot-winged tit might have to be included in &quot;P. ater&quot;, or some coal tits could be considered a distinct species. As occasional hybridization has been recorded between the two, mtDNA alone (which is inherited only from the mother) is insufficient to determine whether hybrid gene flow or another trivial cause (such as incomplete lineage sorting) obfuscates the actual relationships, or whether taxonomic rearrangement is indeed required. With the range of these titmice encircling the Himalayas, without further study it cannot even be excluded that they constitute a ring species – with gene flow occurring in Nepal but not in Afghanistan – as has been shown for other passerines in the same region.

A number of coal tit subspecies are distinguished. The differences in colouration are quite pronounced in some of them, while their differences in size are more subtle. Coal tits from Asia follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule, being larger in colder regions; those from further west, however, do not, as the birds from the uplands around the Mediterranean are larger than those from northern Europe. Across its range, tail length in relation to body length increases along a cline running from southwest to northeast.

The British race &quot;P. a. britannicus&quot; has an olive hue to its brownish-grey back plumage, distinguishing it from the continental European nominate subspecies &quot;P. a. ater&quot; and &quot;P. a. abietum&quot; in which the back is bluish grey without a hint of green or brown. The Irish race &quot;P. a. hibernicus&quot; is distinguished from &quot;britannicus&quot; by the pale sulphur-yellow cheeks, breast and belly. It also has a paler rump (due to light fringes of the uppertail coverts) and a larger bill than its relatives from Britain and the Continent.

The North African race &quot;P. a. ledouci&quot; has yellow underparts and cheeks, and the Cypriot &quot;P. a. cypriotes&quot; has a buff tinge to its upper parts, and deep buff underparts. Asian subspecies are generally rather dusky brownish except for the black-and-white head; they include among others &quot;P. a. michalowskii&quot; of the Caucasus, &quot;P. a. phaeonotus&quot; of Iran, or the Himalayan coal tit &quot;P. a. aemodius&quot; of southwestern China.

==Description==
The coal tit is 10–11.5 cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on subspecies) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the wing coverts appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and irides dark brown.

The young birds in juvenile plumage are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow.

While searching for food, coal tit flocks keep contact with incessant short &quot;dee&quot; or &quot;see-see&quot; calls. The species&#x27; song – if &quot;song&quot; it can be called – is a strident &quot;if-he, if-he, if-he&quot;, heard most frequently from January to June, but also in autumn. The song resembles that of the great tit, but much faster and higher in pitch. One variant of this song ends with a sharp &quot;ichi&quot;. North African birds also have a &quot;&quot; call similar to that of the crested tit (&quot;Lophophanes cristatus&quot;) which is not found in Africa.

==Behaviour and ecology==

It is typically a bird of temperate humid conifer forest, but apart from that shows little habitat specificity. In Bhutan for example coal tits are fairly common residents above the subtropical zone, at about 3,000–3,800 m ASL, and are found in forests dominated by Bhutan fir (&quot;Abies densa&quot;) as well as in those characterized by Himalayan hemlock (&quot;Tsuga dumosa&quot;) and rhododendrons.

The coal tit is an all-year resident throughout almost all range, making only local movements in response to particularly severe weather; only the Siberian birds have a more regular migration. Very rarely, vagrants may cross longer distances; for example the nominate subspecies of continental Europe was recorded in Ireland once in 1960 and once before that, but apparently not since then.

Coal tits will form small flocks in winter with other tits. This species resembles other tits in acrobatic skill and restless activity, though it more frequently pitches on a trunk, and in little hops resembles a treecreeper (&quot;Certhia&quot;). Its food is similar to that of the others; it is keen on beechmast, picks out the seeds from fir (&quot;Abies&quot;) and larch (&quot;Larix&quot;) cones, and joins &quot;Carduelis&quot; redpolls and siskins in alders (&quot;Alnus&quot;) and birches (&quot;Betula&quot;). It will also visit gardens to feed on a variety of foods put out, particularly sunflower seeds.

Coal tits in the laboratory prefer to forage at a variable feeding site when they are in a negative energy budget. They increase evening body mass in response to tawny owl calls. 
After dawn the coal tits increases body mass as soon as possible if food is obtained at a low rate, increasing body mass exponentially until an inflection point when the increase of body mass is slower. The inflection point of the body mass trajectory is 16.7% delayed compared to a high food availability. Subordinate coal tits are excluded from feeding sites by dominants more often in the early morning than in the rest of the day, and they showed more variability in daily mass gain and body mass at dawn than dominant coal tits. In winter, the red blood cells of coal tits have been shown to contain more mitochondria, which consume oxygen and produce heat.

Being common and widespread, the coal tit is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

The coal tit has the dubious distinction of having the largest number of bird fleas (&quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot;) reported from a single nest, 5,754 fleas.

== Breeding ==
A favourite nesting site is a hole in a rotting tree-stump, often low down, and the nest is deep within the hole; holes in the ground, burrows of mice or rabbits, chinks between the stones in walls, old nests of &quot;Pica&quot; magpies or other large birds, and squirrel dreys are also occupied. The materials, moss, hair and grass, are closely felted together, and rabbit fur or feathers added for lining. Seven to eleven red-spotted white eggs are laid, usually in May; this species breeds usually once per year.

<text>Nimrod (; ; ; ) is a mythological biblical figure mentioned in the Book of Genesis and Books of Chronicles. The son of Cush and therefore the great-grandson of Noah, Nimrod was described as a king in the land of Shinar (Lower Mesopotamia). The Bible states that he was &quot;a mighty hunter before the Lord [and] ... began to be mighty in the earth&quot;. Some later (non-biblical) traditions, interpreting the story of Jacob&#x27;s dream in the Bible (Genesis 28:11–19), identified Nimrod as the ruler who had commissioned the construction of the Tower of Babel or of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, and that identification led to his reputation as a king who had been rebellious against God.

There is no evidence that Nimrod was an actual historical person in any of the non-biblical historic records, registers, or king lists (including any of the Mesopotamian ones, which are considerably older and vastly more numerous and comprehensive than the biblical texts). Historians have failed to match Nimrod with any real historically attested figure, or to find any historical, linguistic or genetic link between the Sumerian and Semitic Mesopotamians and the distant and later emerging kingdom of Cush in modern Sudan. In 2002 one scholar suggested that the biblical Nimrod was inspired by one of the exclusively Mesopotamian historical figures, Naram-Sin of Akkad, grandson of Sargon, and attempts have been made by other scholars to attribute the inspiration behind Nimrod to one or more Assyrian, Akkadian or Babylonian kings, or the Assyro-Babylonian god Ninurta.

In more recent times (during the Islamic era), several sites of ruins in the Middle East have been named after Nimrod.

==Biblical account==

The first biblical mention of Nimrod is in the Generations of Noah. He is described as the son of Cush, grandson of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah; and as &quot;a mighty one in the earth&quot; and &quot;a mighty hunter before the Lord&quot;. This is repeated in the 1 Chronicles 1:10, and the &quot;Land of Nimrod&quot; used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the Micah 5:6:

Genesis 10:10 says that the &quot;mainstays of his kingdom&quot; ( &quot;rēšit̲ mamlak̲to&quot;) were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Calneh in Shinar (Mesopotamia)—understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both. Owing to an ambiguity in the original Hebrew text, it is unclear whether it is he or Ashur who additionally built Nineveh, Resen, Rehoboth-Ir and Nimrud (Kalaḥ); both interpretations are reflected in various English versions. Walter Raleigh devoted several pages in his &quot;History of the World&quot; (1614) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.

==Traditions and legends==
In Jewish and Christian tradition, Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of Shinar, although the Bible never states this. Nimrod&#x27;s kingdom included the cities of Babel, Uruk, Akkad, and perhaps Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10). Josephus believed that it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began; in addition to Josephus, this is also the view found in the Talmud (&quot;Hullin&quot; 89a, &quot;Pesahim&quot; 94b, &quot;Erubin&quot; 53a, &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 53b), and later &quot;midrash&quot; such as &quot;Genesis Rabba&quot;. Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king Amraphel, who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.

Josephus wrote:
Since Akkad was destroyed and lost with the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the period 2200–2154 BC (long chronology), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late Early Bronze Age. The association with Erech (Babylonian Uruk), a city that lost its prime importance around 2000 BCE as a result of struggles between Isin, Larsa and Elam, also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin—possibly inserted during the Babylonian captivity.

Judaic interpreters as early as Philo and Yohanan ben Zakkai in the 1st century interpreted &quot;a mighty hunter &quot;before&quot; the Lord&quot; ( &quot;gibbor-ṣayiḏ lip̄nē Yahweh&quot;, lit. &quot;in the face of Yahweh&quot;) as signifying &quot;&quot;in opposition to&quot; the Lord&quot;; a similar interpretation is found in Pseudo-Philo, as well as later in Symmachus. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name &quot;Nimrod&quot; with a Hebrew word meaning &#x27;rebel&#x27;. In Pseudo-Philo (dated c. 70 CE), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while Joktan as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower. Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as &quot;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius&quot; (7th century).

The Book of Jubilees mentions the name of &quot;Nebrod&quot; (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of Azurad, the wife of Eber and mother of Peleg (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.

The Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 56b) attributes Titus&#x27;s death to an insect that flew into his nose and picked at his brain for seven years in a repetition of another legend referring to the biblical King Nimrod.

An early Arabic work known as &quot;Kitab al-Magall&quot; or the &quot;Book of Rolls&quot; (part of Clementine literature) states that Nimrod built the towns of Hadāniūn, Ellasar, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, Rūhīn, Atrapatene, Telalān, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when Reu was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building Nisibis, Raha (Edessa) and Harran when Peleg was 50. It further adds that Nimrod &quot;saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown&quot;. He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. &quot;For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from heaven.&quot; Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the fourth son of Noah.

In the &quot;Recognitions&quot; (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king Ninus, who first appears in the Greek historian Ctesias as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the &quot;Homilies&quot; (H 9:4–6), Nimrod is made to be the same as Zoroaster.

The Syriac &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot; (c. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the &quot;Kitab al-Magall&quot;, except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called &quot;Sisan&quot;, and the fourth son of Noah is called &quot;Yonton&quot;.

Jerome, writing c. 390, explains in &quot;Hebrew Questions on Genesis&quot; that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, &quot;he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.&quot; However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in Sumer, not Syria.

The Ge&#x27;ez &quot;Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan&quot; (c. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;, but the crown maker is called &quot;Santal&quot;, and the name of Noah&#x27;s fourth son who instructs Nimrod is &quot;Barvin&quot;.

However, Ephrem the Syrian (306–373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, &quot;Targum Pseudo-Jonathan&quot; (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower—for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.

&quot;Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod&#x27;s party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, Esau (grandson of Abraham), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot;, which adds that Nimrod had a son named &quot;Mardon&quot; who was even more wicked.

In the &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; by the 9th century Muslim historian al-Tabari, Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, God destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly Syriac, is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, Abu al-Fida, relates the same story, adding that the patriarch Eber (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian Masudi recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of Aram, son of Shem, adding that he reigned 500 years over the Nabateans. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of Canaan, as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.

In Armenian legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, Hayk, defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with Bel) in a battle near Lake Van.

In the Hungarian legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the White Stag [&quot;Fehér Szarvas&quot;] or Silver Stag), King Nimród (&quot;Ménrót&quot;), often described as &quot;Nimród the Giant&quot; or &quot;the giant Nimród&quot;, descendant of Noah, is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel—construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the biblical event of the Great Flood. After the catastrophic failure of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the confusion of tongues, Nimród the giant moved to the land of &quot;Evilát&quot;, where his wife, &quot;Enéh&quot; gave birth to twin brothers &quot;Hunor&quot; and &quot;Magyar&quot; (aka &quot;Magor&quot;). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimród especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer. Hungarian legends held that twin sons of King Nimród, Hunor and Magor were the ancestors of the Huns and the Magyars (Hungarians) respectively, siring their children through the two daughters of King Dul of the Alans, whom they kidnapped after losing track of the silver stag whilst hunting. Both the Huns&#x27; and Magyars&#x27; historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimród. (Simon Kézai, personal &quot;court priest&quot; of King Ladislaus the Cuman, in his &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, 1282–1285. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979). The 16th-century Hungarian prelate Nicolaus Olahus claimed that Attila took for himself the title of &quot;Descendant of the Great Nimrod&quot;.

The hunter god or spirit Nyyrikki, figuring in the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot; as a helper of Lemminkäinen, is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.

The Nimrod Fortress (Qal&#x27;at Namrud in Arabic) on the Golan Heights - actually built during the Crusades by Al-Aziz Uthman, the younger son of Saladin - was anachronistically attributed to Nimrod by later inhabitants of the area.

There is a very brief mention of Nimrod in the Book of Mormon: &quot;(and the name of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter)&quot;.

===Nimrod vs. Abraham===
In Jewish and Islamic traditions, a confrontation between Nimrod and Abraham is said to have taken place. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, or as a symbol of monotheism against polytheism. Some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion. According to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of Pseudo-Philo. The story is also found in the Talmud, and in rabbinical writings in the Middle Ages.

In some versions, such as Flavius Josephus, Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort Semiramis worshipped as a goddess at his side.

A portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham&#x27;s mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.

In some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of gnats which destroys Nimrod&#x27;s army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod&#x27;s brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor Titus, destroyer of the Temple in Jerusalem).

In some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with Cain). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave Eliezer, whom some accounts describe as Nimrod&#x27;s own son (the Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham&#x27;s majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod; Genesis 15:2).

Still other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham&#x27;s crucial act of leaving Mesopotamia and settling in Canaan is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod&#x27;s revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham&#x27;s birth (as in the Bible, also &quot;Jubilees&quot;); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.

The story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of Moses&#x27; birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings – Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with Cyrus, whose birth according to Herodotus was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.

A confrontation is also found in the Quran, between a king, not mentioned by name, and Ibrahim (Arabic for &quot;Abraham&quot;). Some Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In the quranic narrative Ibrahim has a discussion with the king, the former argues that God is the one who gives life and causes death, whereas the unnamed king replies that he gives life and causes death. Ibrahim refutes him by stating that God brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered. The commentaries on this surah offer a wide variety of embellishments of this narrative, one of which by Ibn Kathir, a 14th-century scholar, adding that Nimrod showed his rule over life and death by killing a prisoner and freeing another.

Whether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as &quot;Nimrod the Evil&quot; ().

Nimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baháʼí scriptures, including the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the primary theological work of the Baháʼí Faith. There it is said that Nimrod &quot;dreamed a dream&quot; which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing &quot;the coming of Abraham&quot;. Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the Báb (the herald of the Baháʼí Faith). Citing examples of God&#x27;s power, he asks: &quot;Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod?&quot;

The story of Abraham&#x27;s confrontation with Nimrod did not remain within the confines of learned writings and religious treatises, but also conspicuously influenced popular culture. A notable example is &quot;Quando el Rey Nimrod&quot; (&quot;When King Nimrod&quot;), one of the most well-known folksongs in Ladino (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King Alfonso X of Castile. Beginning with the words: &quot;When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born&quot;, the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham.

===Islamic narrative===
The Quran states, &quot;Have you not considered him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom (i.e. he was prideful)?&quot; Abraham says, &quot;My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.&quot; The king answers, &quot;I give life and cause death&quot;. At this point some commentaries add new narratives like Nimrod bringing forth two men, who were sentenced to death previously. He orders the execution of one while freeing the other one. Then Abraham says, &quot;Indeed, God brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.&quot; This causes the king to exile him, and he leaves for the Levant.

Although Nimrod&#x27;s name is not specifically stated in the Quran, Islamic scholars hold that the &quot;king&quot; mentioned was him. Other traditional stories also exist around Nimrod, which have resulted in him being referenced as a tyrant in Muslim cultures.

According to Mujahid ibn Jabr, &quot;Four people gained control over the Earth, east and west, two believers and two disbelievers. The two believers were Solomon (Sulayman in Islamic texts) and Dhul Qarnayn, and the two disbelievers were Nebuchadnezzar II and Nimrod. No one but they gained power over it.&quot;

===Midrash Rabba version===
The following version of the confrontation between Abraham and Nimrod appears in the Midrash Rabba, a major compilation of Jewish Scriptural exegesis. The part in which this appears, the Genesis Rabbah (Chapter 38, 13), is considered to date from the sixth century.

==Historical interpretations==

Historians, Orientalists, Assyriologists and mythographers have long tried to find links between the Nimrod of biblical texts and real historically attested figures in Mesopotamia or its surrounds. Sugnificantly, no king named Nimrod or with a similar name appears anywhere on any of the considerably older and more numerous pre-biblical, extra-biblical or historic Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian or Babylonian king list, nor does the name Nimrod appear in any other writings from Mesopotamia itself or its neighbours in any context whatsoever during the Bronze Age, Iron Age or pre-Christian Classical Age.

Since the city of Akkad was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200–2154 BC (long chronology), the much later biblical stories mentioning Nimrod seem to be inspired by the late Early Bronze Age. The association with Erech (Sumero-Akkadian Uruk), a city that lost its prime importance around 2000 BC as a result of struggles between Isin, Ur, Larsa and Elam, may have influenced the later stories of Nimrod. Several Mesopotamian ruins were given Nimrod&#x27;s name by invading 8th-century AD Muslim Arabs, including the ruins of the Assyrian city of Kalhu (the biblical Calah), which contrary to biblical claims that it was built by Nimrod, was in reality built by a king of the Middle Assyrian Empire, Shalmaneser I (1274–1244 BC)

A number of attempts to connect him with historical figures have been made without any success.

The Christian Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea as early as the early 4th century, noting that the Babylonian historian Berossus in the 3rd century BC had stated that the first king after the flood was &quot;Euechoios&quot; of Chaldea (in reality Chaldea was a small state in southeast Mesopotamia historically not founded until the late 9th century BC), identified him with Nimrod. George Syncellus (c. 800) also had access to Berossus, and he identified &quot;Euechoios&quot; with the biblical Nimrod. However, like Nimrod, no king named Euechoios appears anywhere in Mesopotamian record. 

More recently, Sumerologists have suggested additionally connecting both this &quot;Euechoios&quot;, and the king of Babylon and grandfather of Gilgamesh who appears in the oldest copies of Aelian (c. 200 AD) as &quot;Euechoros&quot;, with the name of the founder of Uruk known from cuneiform sources as Enmerkar.

In 1920, J. D. Prince also suggested a possible link between the Lord (Ni) of Marad and Nimrod. He mentioned how Dr. Kraeling was now inclined to connect Nimrod historically with Lugal-Banda, a mythological Sumerian king mentioned in Poebel, &quot;Historical Texts&quot;, 1914, whose seat was at the city Marad.

According to Ronald Hendel the name Nimrod is probably a much later polemical distortion of the Semitic Assyrian god Ninurta, a prominent god in Mesopotamian religion who had cult centers in a number of Assyrian cities such as Kalhu, and also in Babylon, and was a patron god of a number of Assyrian kings, and that &#x27;Cush&#x27; is a mistranslation of Kish, a Mesopotamian city, rather than the state that arose in modern day Sudan some time later. Nimrod&#x27;s imperial ventures described in Genesis may be based on the conquests of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I.

Julian Jaynes also indicates Tukulti-Ninurta I (a powerful king of the Middle Assyrian Empire) as the inspiration for Nimrod.

Alexander Hislop, in his tract &quot;The Two Babylons&quot; (1853), identified Nimrod with Ninus (also a mythical figure unattested anywhere in Mesopotamian king lists), who according to Greek mythology was a Mesopotamian king and husband of Queen Semiramis, with a whole host of deities throughout the Mediterranean world, and with the Persian Zoroaster. The identification with Ninus follows that of the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot;; the one with Zoroaster, that of the &quot;Clementine Homilies&quot;, both works part of Clementine literature. Hislop attributed to Semiramis and Nimrod the invention of polytheism and, with it, goddess worship, and that their incestuous male offering was Tammuz. He also claimed that the Catholic Church was a millennia-old secret conspiracy, founded by Semiramis and Nimrod to propagate the pagan religion of ancient Babylon. Grabbe and others have rejected the book&#x27;s arguments as based on a flawed understanding of the texts, but variations of them are accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants.

There was a historical Assyrian queen Shammuramat in the 9th century BC, in reality the wife of Shamshi-Adad V, a king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, whom Assyriologists have identified as the inspiration behind the much later Greco-Persian legends of Semiramis. 

In David Rohl&#x27;s theory, Enmerkar, the Sumerian founder of Uruk, was the original inspiration for Nimrod, because the story of &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot; bears a few similarities to the legend of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, and because the -KAR in Enmerkar means &quot;hunter&quot;. Additionally, Enmerkar is said to have had ziggurats built in both Uruk and Eridu, which Rohl postulates was the site of the original Babel.

Others have attempted to conflate Nimrod with Amraphel, a supposed king in Mesopotamia, but yet again, one who is himself historically unattested in Mesopotamian records.

George Rawlinson believed Nimrod was Belus, based on the fact Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions bear the names &quot;Bel-&quot;. The word &quot;Nibru&quot; in the East Semitic Akkadian language of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia comes from a root meaning to &#x27;pursue&#x27; or to make &#x27;one flee&#x27;, and as Rawlinson pointed out not only does this closely resemble Nimrod&#x27;s name but it also perfectly fits the description of Nimrod in Genesis 10:9 as a great hunter. The Belus-Nimrod equation or link is also found in many old works such as Moses of Chorene and the &quot;Book of the Bee&quot;. Nibru, in the Sumerian language, was the original name of the city of Nippur.

Joseph Poplicha wrote in 1929 about the identification of Nimrod in the first dynasty or Uruk.

More recently, Yigal Levin (2002) suggests that the fictional Nimrod was a recollection of Sargon of Akkad and also of his grandson Naram-Sin, with the name &quot;Nimrod&quot; derived from the latter. He argues that:
==In popular culture==
===Idiom===
In modern North American English, the term &quot;nimrod&quot; is often used to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person, a usage perhaps first recorded in an 1836 letter from Robert E. Lee to a female friend. Lee describes a &quot;young nimrod from the West&quot;, who in declining an appointment to West Point expressed the concern that &quot;I hope my country will not be endangered by my doing so.&quot; Although Lee may have been sarcastically referring to the student as a &quot;tyrant or skillful hunter&quot;, the modern usage more closely fits his message.

The nickname &#x27;Nimrod&#x27; was used mockingly in the 1914 novel by Robert Tressell in &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;. The sarcastic moniker was used towards the foreman (named Hunter) of a gang of workmen as a play both on his surname and on his supposed religious beliefs and sense of self-importance. Other than the Lee letter and the Tressell novel, the first recorded use of &quot;nimrod&quot; in this meaning was in 1932. 

The usage is often said to have been popularized by the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon character Bugs Bunny sarcastically referring to the hunter Elmer Fudd as &quot;nimrod&quot; to highlight the difference between &quot;mighty hunter&quot; and &quot;poor little Nimrod&quot;, i.e. Fudd. However, it is in fact Daffy Duck who refers to Fudd as &quot;my little Nimrod&quot; in the 1948 short &quot;What Makes Daffy Duck&quot;, although Bugs Bunny does refer to Yosemite Sam as &quot;the little Nimrod&quot; in the 1951 short &quot;Rabbit Every Monday&quot;. Both episodes were voiced by Mel Blanc and produced by Edward Selzer.

===Literature===
* In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri (written 1308–1321), Nimrod is portrayed as a giant (which was common in the Medieval period). With the giants Ephialtes, Antaeus, Briareus, Tityos, and Typhon, he stands in chains on the outer edge of Hell&#x27;s Circle of Treachery. His only line is &quot;Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi&quot;, words whose unintelligibility emphasizes his guilt for the confusion of languages after the tower of Babel.

<text>The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf of Antarctica (, an area of roughly and about across: about the size of France). It is several hundred metres thick. The nearly vertical ice front to the open sea is more than long, and between high above the water surface. Ninety percent of the floating ice, however, is below the water surface.

Most of the Ross Ice Shelf is in the Ross Dependency claimed by New Zealand. It floats in, and covers, a large southern portion of the Ross Sea and the entire Roosevelt Island located in the east of the Ross Sea.

The ice shelf is named after Sir James Clark Ross, who discovered it on 28 January 1841. It was originally called &quot;The Barrier&quot;, with various adjectives including &quot;Great Ice Barrier&quot;, as it prevented sailing further south. Ross mapped the ice front eastward to 160° W. In 1947, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names applied the name &quot;Ross Shelf Ice&quot; to this feature and published it in the original U.S. Antarctic Gazetteer. In January 1953, the name was changed to &quot;Ross Ice Shelf&quot;; that name was published in 1956.

==Exploration==


On 5 January 1841, the British Admiralty&#x27;s Ross expedition in the &quot;Erebus&quot; and the &quot;Terror&quot;, three-masted ships with specially strengthened wooden hulls, was going through the pack ice of the Pacific near Antarctica in an attempt to determine the position of the South Magnetic Pole. Four days later, they found their way into open water and were hoping that they would have a clear passage to their destination. But on 11 January, the men were faced with an enormous mass of ice.

Sir James Clark Ross, the expedition&#x27;s commander, remarked: &quot;It was an obstruction of such character as to leave no doubt upon my mind as to our future proceedings, for we might with equal chance of success try to sail through the cliffs of Dover&quot;. Ross, who in 1831 had located the North Magnetic Pole, spent the next two years vainly searching for a sea passage to the South Pole; later, his name was given to the ice shelf and the sea surrounding it. Two volcanoes in the region were named by Ross for his vessels.

For later Antarctic explorers seeking to reach the South Pole, the Ross Ice Shelf became a starting area. In a first exploration of the area by the Discovery Expedition in 1901–1904, Robert Falcon Scott made a significant study of the shelf and its surroundings from his expedition&#x27;s base on Ross Island. By measurement of calved ice bergs and their buoyancy, he estimated the ice sheet to be on average 274 meters thick; the undisturbed morphology of the ice sheet and its inverted temperature profile led him to conclude it was floating on water; and measurements in 1902–1903 showed it had advanced 555 meters northwards in 13.5 months. The findings were presented at a lecture entitled &quot;Universitas Antarctica!&quot; given 7 June 1911 and were published in the account of Scott&#x27;s second expedition (the Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–1913).
Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s southern party (Shackleton, Adams, Marshal, Wild) of the 1908 Nimrod expedition were the first humans to cross the Ice Shelf during its failed attempt to reach the South Pole. Both Roald Amundsen and Scott crossed the shelf to reach the Pole in 1911. Amundsen wrote: &quot;Along its outer edge the Barrier shows an even, flat surface; but here, inside the bay, the conditions were entirely different. Even from the deck of the &quot;Fram&quot; we were able to observe great disturbances of the surface in every direction; huge ridges with hollows between them extended on all sides. The greatest elevation lay to the south in the form of a lofty, arched ridge, which we took to be about high on the horizon. But it might be assumed that this ridge continued to rise beyond the range of vision&quot;.

The next day, the party made its first steps on the Barrier. &quot;After half an hour&#x27;s march we were already at the first important point—the connection between the sea-ice and the Barrier. This connection had always haunted our brains. What would it be like? A high, perpendicular face of ice, up which we should have to haul our things laboriously with the help of tackles? Or a great and dangerous fissure, which we should not be able to cross without going a long way round? We naturally expected something of the sort. This mighty and terrible monster would, of course, offer resistance in some form or other,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;The mystic Barrier! All accounts without exception, from the days of Ross to the present time, had spoken of this remarkable natural formation with apprehensive awe. It was as though one could always read between the lines the same sentence: &#x27;Hush, be quiet! the mystic Barrier!&#x27;

&quot;One, two, three, and a little jump, and the Barrier was surmounted!&quot;

==Composition and movement==
Ice shelves are thick plates of ice, formed continuously by glaciers, that float atop an ocean. The shelves act as &quot;brakes&quot; for the glaciers. These shelves serve another important purpose—&quot;they moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers&#x27; surfaces. Once their ice shelves are removed, the glaciers increase in speed due to meltwater percolation and/or a reduction of braking forces, and they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments. Glacier ice speed increases are already observed in Peninsula areas where ice shelves disintegrated in prior years.&quot;

The Ross Ice Shelf is one of many such shelves. It reaches into Antarctica from the north, and covers an area of about , nearly the size of France. The ice mass is about wide and long. In some places, namely its southern areas, the ice shelf can be almost 750 m (2,450 ft) thick. The Ross Ice Shelf pushes out into the sea at between a day. Other glaciers gradually add bulk to it. At the same time, the freezing of seawater below the ice mass increases the thickness of the ice from . Sometimes, fissures and cracks may cause part of the shelf to break off; the largest known is about , that is, slightly larger than Belgium. Iceberg B-15, the world&#x27;s largest recorded iceberg, was calved from the Ross Ice Shelf during March 2000.

Scientists have long been intrigued by the shelf and its composition. Many scientific teams researching the Antarctic have made camps on or adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf. This includes McMurdo Station, built next to the Ross Ice Shelf on volcanic rock. One major effort was a series of studies conducted in 1957 and 1958, which were continued during the 1960–61 season. The efforts involved an international team of scientists. Some parties explored the glaciers and others the valleys on the ice shelf. 
From 1967 to 1972 the Scott Polar Research Institute reported extensive observations using radio echo sounding. The technique allowed measurements to be taken from the air; allowing a criss cross track of 35,000 km to be covered; compared with a 3,000 km track from previous seismic sounding on the ground. More detailed surveys were executed between 1973 and 1978.

A significant scientific endeavor called the Ross Ice Shelf Project was launched with a plan of drilling into the shelf to sample the biomass in the area and make other determinations about the shelf and its relationship to the sea floor. This is believed to be the first oceanographic ice shelf borehole. The project included surface glaciological observations as well as drilling, and the glaciological portion started during the planning phase of the drilling. The drilling portion of the project was to have begun during 1974, but the actual drilling was delayed until 1976. Finally, in 1977, the scientists were able to drill successfully through the ice, making a hole that could be sampled every few days for three weeks. The team was able to map the sea floor, study the tides, and assess the fish and various other forms of life in the waters. The team also examined the oceanographic and geological conditions as well as the temperature of the ice. They estimated that the base of the shelf was −2.16 °C (27.3 °F). They also made other calculations about the fluctuations of the temperatures.
The results of these various projects were published in a series of reports in the 2 February 1979 issue of &quot;Science&quot;.

During the 1980s, a network of weather stations was installed to record temperatures on the shelf and throughout the more remote parts of the continent.

University of Colorado&#x27;s National Snow and Ice Data Center has been studying ice shelves and, in 2002, announced that, based on several breakups of ice shelves, including Larsen B, has begun to reassess their stability. Their scientists stated that the temperature of the warmest portion of the shelf is &quot;only a few degrees too cool in summer presently to undergo the same kind of retreat process. The Ross Ice Shelf is the main outlet for several major glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which contains the equivalent of 5 m of sea level rise in its above-sea-level ice.&quot; The report added that observations of &quot;iceberg calving&quot; on the Ross Ice Shelf are, in their opinion, unrelated to its stability.
Scientific exploration continues to uncover interesting information and the analyses have resulted in some interesting theories being posited and publicized. One such opinion, given in 2006 based on a geological survey, suggested that the ice shelf had collapsed previously, perhaps suddenly, which could well happen again.

A science team from New Zealand installed a camp in the centre of the shelf in late 2017. The expedition was led by glaciologist Christina Hulbe and brought together oceanographers, glaciologists, biologists and sedimentologists to examine the ice, ocean and sediment in the central shelf region. One of the key findings was that the ice in the region was re-freezing. This re-freezing and growth of an ice shelf is not uncommon but the Ross Ice Shelf situation appeared to be very variable as there was no evidence of long-term freezing. A recent study attribute this variability in-part to tidal mixing.

A second New Zealand expedition in 2019 traveled to the grounding line region of the Kamb Ice Stream. The hot water drill borehole at this site penetrated through over 500 m of snow and ice to an ocean cavity only 30 m deep at this location. As well as sampling the ocean and sediment, it was the first deployment beneath the Ross Ice Shelf of the Remotely operated underwater vehicle Icefin developed at Georgia Tech, a vehicle designed around parameters suitable for exploration of the liquid cavities of places like Europa. The same New Zealand team returned to another site along the Kamb coast in December 2021, this time drilling through an under-ice river that proved to be essentially oceanic. The team were able to melt through the ice to discover the 250 m deep river had formed a relatively narrow channel beneath the ice. They also recorded evidence of the tsunami generated by the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption and tsunami.

<doc id="243480" wikidata="Q5384687" url="?curid=243480" title="Equity derivative">
<text>In finance, an equity derivative is a class of derivatives whose value is at least partly &quot;derived&quot; from one or more underlying equity securities. Options and futures are by far the most common equity derivatives, however there are many other types of equity derivatives that are actively traded.

==Equity options==

Equity options are the most common type of equity derivative. They provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of stock (1 contract = 100 shares of stock), at a set price (strike price), within a certain period of time (prior to the expiration date).

==Warrants==

In finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy stock of the company that issued it at a specified price, which is much lower than the stock price at time of issue. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower interest rates or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers.

==Convertible bonds==

Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre-announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It can be used by investors to obtain the upside of equity-like returns while protecting the downside with regular bond-like coupons.

==Equity futures, options and swaps==
Investors can gain exposure to the equity markets using futures, options and swaps. These can be done on single stocks, a customized basket of stocks or on an index of stocks. These equity derivatives derive their value from the price of the underlying stock or stocks.

===Stock market index futures===

Stock markets index futures are futures contracts used to replicate the performance of an underlying stock market index. They can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the index. Indices for futures include well-established indices such as S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, DAX, CAC 40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility.

===Equity basket derivatives===
Equity basket derivatives are futures, options or swaps where the underlying is a non-index basket of shares. They have similar characteristics to equity index derivatives, but are always traded OTC (over the counter, i.e. between established institutional investors), as the basket definition is not standardized in the way that an equity index is.

These are used normally for correlation trading.

===Single-stock futures===
Single-stock futures are exchange-traded futures contracts based on an individual underlying security rather than a stock index. Their performance is similar to that of the underlying equity itself, although as futures contracts they are usually traded with greater leverage. Another difference is that holders of long positions in single stock futures typically do not receive dividends and holders of short positions do not pay dividends. Single-stock futures may be cash-settled or physically settled by the transfer of the underlying stocks at expiration, although in the United States only physical settlement is used to avoid speculation in the market.

===Equity swap===
An equity swap is an exchange of future cash flows between two parties that allows each party to diversify its income for a specified period of time while still holding its original assets. The two sets of nominally equal cash flows are exchanged as per the terms of the swap, which may involve an equity-based cash flow (such as from a stock asset) that is traded for a fixed-income cash flow (such as a benchmark rate), but this is not necessarily the case. Besides diversification and tax benefits, equity swaps also allow large institutions to hedge specific assets or positions in their portfolios.

==Exchange-traded derivatives==

Other examples of equity derivative securities include exchange-traded funds and Intellidexes.

<doc id="243487" wikidata="Q13423498" url="?curid=243487" title="Swiss Civilian Service">
<text>The Swiss Civilian Service is a Swiss institution, created in 1996 as a civilian substitute service to military service. It was introduced as part of the so-called &quot;Vision 95 (Armeeleitbild 95)&quot; reform package. Anyone who is unable to do military service for reasons of conscience can submit an application to perform civilian service instead. Formerly, the applicant was then forced to attend a hearing where they had to explain their reasons for refusal. Now, they must simply take part in a one-day introductory session to civilian service within three months of submitting their application.

If one is unfit to serve in the military because of physical or psychological impairments, he is also deemed unfit for civilian service, even if the impairments do not render the individual unable to fulfill a specific task related to the civilian service. This is true, for example, for a disabled person in a wheelchair who is perfectly able to work in the administration of a nursing home, however since 2013 people deem unfit can choose to apply for a military service despite incapacity, most notably Nouh Arhab in 2021 who served in the army despite being in a wheelchair.

Men declared unfit to serve in the military pay an exemption tax of 3 percent of their yearly taxable income until the age of 37 but a maximum of eleven installments. 
However, anyone who is considered unfit for service and receives a pension or helplessness allowance from the Federal Disability Insurance or Accident Insurance is exempt from the tax. The same applies to anyone who is considered unfit for service due to a major disability and is not in receipt of a helplessness allowance, but nevertheless fulfills one of the two minimum requirements for the granting of such an allowance (including deaf people). Finally, anyone who, due to a major physical, mental or psychological disability, has an income subject to tax which, after deductions, does not exceed by more than 100% his subsistence minimum within the meaning of the law of prosecution is also exempt from tax.

Conscripts found to be sufficiently unfit for regular military service, but not for exemption, take part in civil protection, where they may be called on to assist the police, fire or health departments, as well as natural disaster relief and crowd control during demonstrations or events with large attendance. Each day served will reduce their exemption tax by 4 percent.

Women are also allowed to serve in the civilian service or in the armed forces. Women serve voluntarily.

In 2005, the Swiss Federal Assembly began to discuss if the &quot;state of conscience hearings&quot; should be abolished and if the willingness to serve a longer time (see below) should be the only criterion, citing the large administrative costs for judging the cases of just a few thousand applicants per year. The high rate of young people opting to serve in the alternative service has also created organizational problems. On the other hand, the civilian service option under the Vision 95 reform package has increased the rate of approval of the public, particularly the young segment of the population, for the existence of the Swiss armed forces.

== Civilian service ==
Once part of the civilian service program, one has to work 50 percent longer than the total normal cumulative military service period. Full cumulative military service for normal soldiers is currently 245 days, while full civilian service is 365 days. Many nonprofit organizations are licensed to employ civilian service workers. Unlike the former Civilian Service in Germany, where the servants did their work mainly in hospitals and healthcare sites, Swiss ones can apply for work in a broad variety of opportunities: health care, welfare, environmental protection, agriculture (small or alpine farms), research projects, and development assistance abroad.

Civilian servicemen must have the appropriate skills for each type of assignment – for example, because there are very few job vacancies in development aid.

A big difference between civilian and military service is that civilian service participants can greatly profit from his substitute service – in terms of work experience – to achieve a better position after the service, although it is formally not allowed to do civilian service with, for example, the goal of passing an exam in mind. So, during civilian service in a research institute, one must not write personal academic papers to be submitted at a later time.

There are still issues with how to handle Swiss living abroad who have already passed recruitment and are already members of the Swiss militia army. In this case, they are not exempt from military service or civilian service, and every step of the application process requires their presence in Switzerland.

<doc id="243495" wikidata="Q582172" url="?curid=243495" title="Nefertiti Bust">
<text>The Nefertiti Bust is a painted stucco-coated limestone bust of Nefertiti, the Great Royal Wife of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten. It is on display in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.

The work is believed to have been crafted in 1345 BC by Thutmose because it was found in his workshop in Tell-el Amarna, Egypt. It is one of the most-copied works of ancient Egypt. Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world and an icon of feminine beauty.

A German archaeological team led by Ludwig Borchardt discovered the bust in 1912 in Thutmose&#x27;s workshop. It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery, including the cellar of a bank, a salt-mine in Merkers-Kieselbach, the Dahlem museum, the Egyptian Museum in Charlottenburg and the Altes Museum. It is displayed at the Neues Museum in Berlin, where it was originally displayed before World War II. Egypt has called for the return of the bust, citing provisions that prohibited any items of great archaeological value from leaving Egypt. Egypt accuses Borchardt of &quot;wrapping the bust to conceal its value and smuggling it out of the country&quot;. 

The Nefertiti bust has become not only a defining emblem of ancient Egypt, but also a symbol of the impact that European colonialism has had on Egypt&#x27;s history and culture. It has been the subject of an argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation, which began in 1924, once the bust was first displayed to the public, and more generally it fuelled discussions over the role museums play in undoing colonialism. Today, Egypt continues to demand the repatriation of the bust, whereas German officials and the Berlin Museum assert their ownership by citing an official protocol, signed by the German excavators and the French-led Egyptian Antiquities Service of the time.

==History==

===Background===

Nefertiti (meaning &quot;the beautiful one has come forth&quot;) was the 14th-century BC Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called Atenism dedicated to the Sun disc Aten. Little is known about Nefertiti. Theories suggest she could have been an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named Ay, who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352 BC to 1336 BC. Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten, one of whom, Ankhesenpaaten (renamed Ankhesenamun after the suppression of the Aten cult), married Tutankhamun, Nefertiti&#x27;s stepson. While it was once thought that Nefertiti disappeared in the twelfth year of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign because of her death or because she took a new name, she was still alive in the sixteenth year of her husband&#x27;s reign according to a limestone quarry inscription found at Deir Abu Hinnis &quot;on the eastern side of the Nile, about ten kilometres [6 miles] north of Amarna&quot;, in today&#x27;s Al-Minya Governorate Nefertiti may have become a pharaoh in her own right for a short time after her husband&#x27;s death.

The bust of Nefertiti is believed to have been crafted about 1345 BC by the sculptor Thutmose. The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the &quot;house altar&quot;.

===Discovery and removal from Egypt===

The bust was found on 6 December 1912 at Amarna by an archaeological team funded by the German Oriental Company (&quot;Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft&quot; – DOG), a voluntary association founded by one of the wealthiest men in Prussia, James Simon, who exported more than 20,000 artefacts from Egypt and Iraq. The team was led by German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt. The bust was found in what had been the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose, along with other unfinished busts of Nefertiti. Borchardt&#x27;s diary provides the main written account of the find; he remarks, &quot;Suddenly we had in our hands the most alive Egyptian artwork. You cannot describe it with words. You must see it.&quot;

A 1924 document found in the archives of the German Oriental Company recalls a 20 January 1913 meeting between Borchardt and a senior Egyptian official to discuss the division of the archeological finds of 1912 between Germany and Egypt. According to the secretary of the German Oriental Company (who was the author of the document and who was present at the meeting), Borchardt &quot;wanted to save the bust for us&quot;, referring to Germany.

While Philipp Vandenberg describes the theft as &quot;adventurous and beyond comparison&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine lists it among the &quot;Top 10 Plundered Artifacts&quot;. Borchardt showed Egypt&#x27;s French chief antiques inspector, Gustave Lefebvre, a photograph of the bust &quot;that didn&#x27;t show Nefertiti in her best light&quot;. When Lefebre inspected the artifacts found in the investigation, the bust was already wrapped up in a box sitting in a dimly lit room. It is unknown whether Lefebre &quot;went to the trouble of lifting the bust out of the box&quot;. Borchardt also wrongly claimed the bust was made of gypsum, instead of limestone. The German Oriental Society maintains that the finds of the dig were divided fairly, noting that Nefertiti was at the top of the exchange list and that &quot;the inspector could have looked at everything closely at the time&quot;.

==Description and examinations==
The bust is tall and weighs about . It is made of a limestone core covered with painted stucco layers. The face is completely symmetrical and almost intact, but the left eye lacks the inlay present in the right. The iris of the right eye is of inserted quartz with black paint and is fixed with beeswax. The background of the eye-socket is unadorned limestone. Nefertiti wears her characteristic blue crown known as the &quot;Nefertiti cap crown&quot; with a golden diadem band looped around like horizontal ribbons and joining at the back, and an Uraeus (cobra), which is now broken, over her brow. She also wears a broad collar with a floral pattern. The ears have suffered some damage. &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Art Through the Ages&quot; suggests that &quot;With this elegant bust, Thutmose may have been alluding to a heavy flower on its slender sleek stalk by exaggerating the weight of the crowned head and the length of the almost serpentine neck.&quot;

According to David Silverman, the bust reflects the classical Egyptian art style, deviating from the &quot;eccentricities&quot; of the Amarna art style, which was developed in Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. The exact function of the bust is unknown, though it is theorized that the bust may be a sculptor&#x27;s modello to be used as a basis for other official portraits, kept in the artist&#x27;s workshop.

===Colours===
Borchardt commissioned a chemical analysis of the coloured pigments of the head. The result of the examination was published in the book &quot;Portrait of Queen Nofretete&quot; in 1923:
* Blue: powdered frit, coloured with copper oxide
* Skin colour (light red): fine powdered lime spar coloured with red chalk (iron oxide)
* Yellow: orpiment (arsenic sulfide)
* Green: powdered frit, coloured with copper and iron oxide
* Black: coal with wax as a binding medium
* White: chalk

===Missing left eye===
When the bust was first discovered, no quartz to represent the iris of the left eyeball was present as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £1000 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris had fallen out when Thutmose&#x27;s workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection and lost her left eye, though the presence of an iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.

Dietrich Wildung proposed that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and was used by the master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Art Through the Ages&quot; and Silverman present a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, suggested that Thutmose created the left eye, but that it was later destroyed.

===CT scans===
The bust was first CT scanned in 1992, with the scan producing cross sections of the bust every . In 2006, Dietrich Wildung, director of Berlin&#x27;s Egyptian Museum, while trying a different lighting at the Altes Museum, where the bust was then displayed, observed wrinkles on Nefertiti&#x27;s neck and bags under her eyes, suggesting the sculptor had tried to depict signs of aging. A CT scan confirmed Wildung&#x27;s findings; Thutmose had added gypsum under the cheeks and eyes in an attempt to perfect his sculpture.

The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, director of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009&#x27;s &quot;Radiology&quot;. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases around her mouth and cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose are leveled by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect &quot;aesthetic ideals of the era&quot;. The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just under the stucco.

==Later history==
The bust has become &quot;one of the most admired, and most copied, images from ancient Egypt&quot;, and the star exhibit used to market Berlin&#x27;s museums. It is seen as an &quot;icon of international beauty.&quot; &quot;Showing a woman with a long neck, elegantly arched brows, high cheekbones, a slender nose and an enigmatic smile played about red lips, the bust has established Nefertiti as one of the most beautiful faces of antiquity.&quot; It is described as the most famous bust of ancient art, comparable only to the mask of Tutankhamun.

Nefertiti has become an icon of Berlin&#x27;s culture. Some 500,000 visitors see her every year. The bust is described as &quot;the best-known work of art from ancient Egypt, arguably from all antiquity&quot;. Her face is on postcards of Berlin and 1989 German postage stamps.

===Locations in Germany===
The bust has been in Germany since 1913, when it was shipped to Berlin and presented to James Simon, a wholesale merchant and the sponsor of the Amarna excavation. It was displayed at Simon&#x27;s residence until 1913, when Simon lent the bust and other artifacts from the Amarna dig to the Berlin Museum. Although the rest of the Amarna collection was displayed in 1913–14, the bust was kept secret at Borchardt&#x27;s request. In 1918, the museum discussed the public display of the bust, but again kept it secret at the request of Borchardt. It was permanently donated to the museum in 1920. In 1923, the bust was revealed to the public in Borchardt&#x27;s writings; in 1924, it was displayed to the public as part of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. The bust created a sensation, swiftly becoming a world-renowned icon of feminine beauty and one of the most universally recognised artifacts to survive from Ancient Egypt. The bust was displayed in Berlin&#x27;s Neues Museum on Museum Island until the museum was closed in 1939; with the onset of World War II, Berlin museums were emptied and artifacts moved to secure shelters for safekeeping. Initially stored in the cellar of the Prussian Governmental Bank, the bust was moved in the autumn of 1941 to the tower of a flak bunker in Berlin. The Neues Museum suffered bombings in 1943 by the Royal Air Force. On 6 March 1945, the bust was moved to a German salt mine at Merkers-Kieselbach in Thuringia.

In March 1945, the bust was found by the American Army and given over to its Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives branch. It was moved to the Reichsbank in Frankfurt and shipped in August to the U.S. Central Collecting Point in Wiesbaden, where it was put on public display beginning in 1946. It remained on display at the Museum Wiesbaden for ten years before being transferred in 1956 to West Berlin, where it was exhibited at the Dahlem Museum. As early as 1946, East Germany (German Democratic Republic) pressed for the return of the bust to Museum Island in East Berlin, where it had been displayed before the war. In 1967, the bust was moved to the Egyptian Museum in the Charlottenburg borough of Berlin and remained there until 2005, when it was moved to the Altes Museum. The bust returned to the Neues Museum as its centerpiece when the museum reopened in October 2009.

==Controversies==
===Requests for repatriation to Egypt===
Since the official unveiling of the bust in Berlin in 1924, Egyptian authorities have demanded its return to Egypt. In 1925, Egypt threatened to ban German excavations in Egypt unless the bust was returned. In 1929, Egypt offered to exchange other artifacts for the bust, but Germany declined.

Although Germany had previously strongly opposed repatriation, in 1933 Hermann Göring considered returning the bust to King Fuad I of Egypt as a political gesture. Hitler opposed the idea and told the Egyptian government that he would build a new Egyptian museum for Nefertiti. &quot;In the middle, this wonder, Nefertiti, will be enthroned,&quot; Hitler said. &quot;I will never relinquish the head of the Queen.&quot; While the bust was under American control, Egypt requested the United States to hand it over; the US refused and advised Egypt to take up the matter with the new German authorities. In the 1950s, Egypt again tried to initiate negotiations, but there was no response from Germany. In 1989, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak viewed the bust and announced that Nefertiti was &quot;the best ambassador for Egypt&quot; in Berlin.

Egyptian archaeologist, Egyptologist, and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, Zahi Hawass believed that the bust belongs to Egypt and that it was taken out of Egypt illegally and should therefore be returned. He maintained the stance that Egyptian authorities were misled over the acquisition of the bust in 1913 and demanded that Germany prove that it was exported legally. According to Kurt G. Siehr, another argument in support of repatriation is that &quot;Archeological finds have their &#x27;home&#x27; in the country of origin and should be preserved in that country.&quot; The repatriation issue sprang up again in 2003 over the &quot;Body of Nefertiti&quot; sculpture. In 2005, Hawass requested that UNESCO intervene to return the bust.

In 2007, Hawass threatened to ban exhibitions of Egyptian artifacts in Germany, if the bust was not lent to Egypt, but to no avail. He also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to German museums to initiate what he called a &quot;scientific war&quot;. Hawass wanted Germany to lend the bust to Egypt in 2012 for the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids of Giza. Simultaneously, a campaign called &quot;Nefertiti Travels&quot; was launched by cultural association CulturCooperation, based in Hamburg, Germany. They distributed postcards depicting the bust with the words &quot;Return to Sender&quot; and wrote an open letter to German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann supporting the view that Egypt should be given the bust on loan. In 2009, when the bust was moved back to the Neues Museum, the appropriateness of Berlin as its location was questioned.

Several German art experts have attempted to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and French authorities in Egypt. German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that legal arguments for repatriation were insubstantial. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.

In December 2009, Friederike Seyfried, director of Berlin&#x27;s Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, presented to the Egyptians documents held by the museum regarding the discovery of the bust, which include a protocol signed by the German excavator and the Egyptian Antiquities Service. In the documents, the bust was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess, but in his diary, Borchardt clearly referred to it as the head of Nefertiti. &quot;This proves that Borchardt wrote this description so that his country can get the statue,&quot; Hawass said. &quot;These materials confirm Egypt&#x27;s contention that (he) did act unethically with intent to deceive.&quot; However, Hawass said Egypt did not consider the bust to be a looted antiquity. &quot;I really want it back,&quot; he said. His statement also said that the authority to approve the return of the bust to Egypt lies with the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and the German culture minister.

===Allegations over authenticity===

The French language book &quot;Le Buste de Nefertiti – une Imposture de l&#x27;Egyptologie ?&quot; (&quot;The Bust of Nefertiti – a Fraud in Egyptology?&quot;) by Swiss art historian Henri Stierlin and the book &quot;Missing Link in Archaeology&quot; by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust would have been a sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery in 1923 and, while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. French archaeologists present at the site as well never mentioned the finding and neither did written accounts of the digs. Stierlin remarked that the archaeologist &quot;didn&#x27;t even bother to supply a description, which is amazing for an exceptional work found intact&quot;. Ercivan suggests Borchardt&#x27;s wife was the model for the bust and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler&#x27;s orders and that the original was lost in World War II.

Scientists who have studied the sculpture, discovered that the pigments used on the bust have been matched to those used by ancient Egyptian artisans. The chemical analysis on the dyes and pigments was initially done by Friedrich Rathgen, presented in Borchardt&#x27;s book “Portrait of Queen Nofretete” (1923). They matched the ones in the 18th dynasty paintings, and a later analysis by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology confirmed the results in 1982. The bust also bears resemblance to other unfinished, but recognizable busts of Queen Nefertiti.

A 2006 CT scan that discovered the &quot;hidden face&quot; of Nefertiti proved, according to &quot;Science News,&quot; that the bust was genuine.

In 2009, director of Berlin&#x27;s Egyptian Museum, Dietrich Wildung, dismissed the claims of forgery. He stated they were a publicity stunt, adding that radiological tests, detailed CT computer tomography and material analysis support its authenticity. 

Egyptian authorities also dismissed Stierlin&#x27;s theory, with Hawass remarking that &quot;Stierlin is not a historian. He is delirious.&quot; Although Stierlin had argued &quot;Egyptians cut shoulders horizontally&quot; and Nefertiti had vertical shoulders, Hawass said that the new style seen in the bust is part of the changes introduced by Akhenaten, the husband of Nefertiti. Hawass also claimed that Thutmose had created the eye, but it was later destroyed.

===&quot;Body of Nefertiti&quot;===
In 2003, the Egyptian Museum in Berlin allowed the Hungarian artist duo Little Warsaw, András Gálik and Bálint Havas, to place the bust atop a nearly nude female bronze for a video installation to be shown at the Venice Biennale modern art festival. The artists said the project, called &quot;Body of Nefertiti,&quot; was an attempt to pay homage to the bust. According to Wildung, it showed &quot;the continued relevance of the ancient world to today&#x27;s art.&quot; Egyptian cultural officials proclaimed it to be a disgrace to &quot;one of the great symbols of their country&#x27;s history&quot; and banned Wildung and his wife from further exploration in Egypt. The Egyptian Minister for Culture, Farouk Hosny, declared that Nefertiti was &quot;not in safe hands&quot; and although Egypt had not renewed their claims for restitution &quot;due to the good relations with Germany,&quot; this &quot;recent behaviour&quot; was unacceptable.

===3D scan of the Bust===
In 2016 a freedom of information request was made to the Egyptian Museum for access to a full colour scan of the bust that had been made by the museum 10 years prior. The museum declined the request citing impact on gift shop revenue. Eventually the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation which oversees the museum released the file, which is now available (not directly from the museum), however controversially attached a copyright to the work, which is in the public domain.

===The Nefertiti bust and the Ceiling of King Ramses IV’s tomb===
In 2023, images circulating on social media showed the ceiling of King Ramses IV tomb as resembling the back of the bust of Nefertiti statue. These images are altered and do not represent the actual ceiling of any King tombs by patterns or designs as suggested by the fake images.

==Cultural significance==
In 1930, the German press described the bust as their new monarch, personifying it as a queen. As the &quot;&#x27;most precious ... stone in the setting of the diadem&#x27; from the art treasures of &#x27;Prussia Germany&#x27;&quot;, Nefertiti would re-establish the imperial German national identity after 1918. Hitler described the bust as &quot;a unique masterpiece, an ornament, a true treasure&quot;, and pledged to build a museum to house it. By the 1970s, the bust had become an issue of national identity to both German states, East Germany and West Germany, created after World War II. In 1999, the bust appeared on an election poster for the green political party Bündnis 90/Die Grünen as a promise for a cosmopolitan and multi-cultural environment with the slogan &quot;Strong Women for Berlin!&quot; According to Claudia Breger, another reason that the bust became associated with German national identity was its place as a rival to Tutankhamun, found by the British who then effectively controlled Egypt.

The bust became an influence on popular culture, with Jack Pierce&#x27;s make-up work on Elsa Lanchester&#x27;s hairstyle in the film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; being inspired by it.

<text>Sevilla Fútbol Club () is a Spanish professional football club based in Seville, Andalusia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

Sevilla have won the UEFA Cup / Europa League seven times, the most of any club, most recently in 2023. It is the second Spain&#x27;s oldest club after Recreativo de Huelva. The club was formed on 25 January 1890, with the Scottish-born Edward Farquharson Johnston as their first president. On 14 October 1905, the club&#x27;s articles of association were registered in the Civil Government of Seville under the presidency of the Jerez-born José Luis Gallegos Arnosa. Sevilla has a long-standing rivalry with cross-city rival Real Betis.

Sevilla are also the most successful football club in Andalusia in terms of titles, with eighteen Andalusian Cup, one national league title in 1945–46, five Spanish Cup titles (1935, 1939, 1948, 2007, and 2010), one Spanish Super Cup (2007), a record seven UEFA Cup / UEFA Europa League (2006, 2007, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, and 2023) and one UEFA Super Cup (2006). They were also designated by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics as the World&#x27;s Best Club in 2006 and 2007, thus being the first club to achieve this distinction in two consecutive years.

The youth team Sevilla Atlético, founded in 1958, currently play in Primera División RFEF. Other clubs related to Sevilla FC include their women&#x27;s team. The rowing team that defends its crest in the yearly Sevilla-Betis boat race is not a section of the club but a call-up of registered-as-supporters professional rowers from the various rowing clubs of Seville.

The club&#x27;s home ground is the 43,883-seat Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. It is located in the neighborhood of Nervión, Seville, and is named after the late Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, who was the president of Sevilla FC for a total of 17 years.

==History==
===Foundation to Civil War===
The practice of football was introduced in Seville at the end of the 19th century by the large British expatriate population in the city, composed by owners or managers of manufacturing companies based in the capital of Andalusia. Sevilla Fútbol Club was founded on 25 January 1890 as &quot;Sevilla Foot-ball Club&quot; (in English).

Sevilla FC was duly formed on 25 January 1890 while a group of young British, mainly Scots, along with other young men of Spanish origin, celebrated Burns Night in Seville. The club&#x27;s founding document, published on the &quot;Dundee Courier&quot;&#x27;s edition of 17 March 1890 describes in full detail the formation of the club and how those young founding members decided first to play under Association Rules, secondly to bear the word &quot;football&quot; within its name and thirdly, to elect their &quot;office-bearers&quot;. The following paragraph is an extract of that article:

The club&#x27;s first president was the Scot Mr. Edward Farquharson Johnston (Elgin, 14 October 1854), who was the British vice-consul in Seville and co-proprietor of the firm MacAndrews &amp; Co., ship-owners with commercial lines between Spain and the UK, one of them being the transport of Seville oranges. Hugh MacColl, another Scottish young man (Glasgow, 9 June 1861), a marine engineer who at that time had moved to Seville to work as the technical manager of Portilla White foundry, was their first captain. One of Maccoll&#x27;s partners in the Portilla White foundry in Seville, Isaias White junior, was the club&#x27;s first secretary. He was the son of an English entrepreneur who founded the aforesaid company, one of the major foundries in Spain at the end of the 19th century.

To celebrate the foundation of the club, Isaias White sent a letter to Huelva Recreation Club, to invite them to play a football match in Seville. That letter was published by the Spanish newspaper &quot;La Provincia&quot;. The Huelva club accepted the invitation and the match took place on 8 March 1890, being thus the first official match ever played in Spain. Sevilla FC won that historical match 2–0, with the first goal in an official match in Spanish football history scored by the Seville team player Ritson. Isaias lived at Calle Bailen 41 in Seville (the house still exists but has since been renumbered) making this the first home of Sevilla FC.

In 1907, Sevilla Balompíe was founded, followed by Betis Football Club in 1909, Recreativo de Sevilla and Español de Sevilla. More clubs were formed as the years passed and more competitive matches were organized between the teams, although Sevilla FC, the oldest club of the city, imposed its supremacy over the other clubs in this early period. 

In 1912, the first Copa de Sevilla was played and won by Sevilla FC. From 1915 to 1940, the Campeonato Regional Sur (also known as the Copa Andalucía) was organized by the &quot;Federación Sur&quot; (Andalusian FA) and these championships included Sevilla FC, Real Betis Balompié, Recreativo de Huelva, Español de Cádiz and the sporadic participation of other clubs such as Nacional de Sevilla and Córdoba. The domination of Sevilla was so evident that of the 20 championships played, 17 were won by Sevilla FC, (the three remaining being won by Español de de Cádiz, Recreativo de Huelva and Real Betis Balompié).

In 1917, Sevilla FC participated in the &quot;Copa de España&quot; for the first time and became the first Andalusian team to reach the final round of the competition. In 1928, when the &quot;Campeonato Nacional de Liga&quot; (National League Championships) was organized, Sevilla FC was not part of the First Division due to their defeat to Racing de Santander in an elimination game that was set-up to decide which of the two teams would compete in the newly formed league.

At the end of the 1933–34 season, Sevilla FC was promoted to the First Division of the &quot;Campeonato Nacional de Liga.&quot; In 1935, they were proclaimed &quot;Campeón de Copa&quot; (Cup Champions) for the first time by defeating Sabadell, repeated in 1939 against Racing de Ferrol and again in 1948 against Celta de Vigo. The club participated in two other finals, but conceded defeat to Athletic Bilbao in 1955 and to Real Madrid in 1962. Sevilla FC remained in the First Division from the 1933–34 season until 1968, when they were relegated to the Second Division, a tier from which they have never further been relegated from.
The 1945–46 season was one of high importance in the history of Sevilla, as it marked the first, and to date only, time in which Sevilla FC were League champions. On four other occasions, the club was proclaimed &quot;subcampeón de Liga&quot; (League Runner-up: 1939–40, 1942–43, 1950–51 and 1956–57).

Including the 2021–22 season, Sevilla has participated 78 times in the First Division and 13 in the Second Division, never dropping below the Second Division. Sevilla has also participated in four European tournaments, the &quot;Copa de Europa&quot; (European League Winners Cup) (1957–58); Recopa (Winners Cup) (1962–63) and UEFA Cup on nine occasions (1966–67, 1970–71, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1990–91, 1995–96, 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2006–07). Sevilla also participated in the UEFA Champions League in 2007–08.

There are more than 400 individuals who currently play for the Sevilla FC organization, which includes two semi-professional teams (in Second Division A – second national category) and 12 youth teams.

Sevilla has always counted on having international players within its ranks to aid in the pursuit of trophies. The first of these players were Spencer and Herminio in the 1920s. Juan Arza, an international player from the 1940s, was proclaimed top scorer of the Spanish League in the 1954–55 season, with 29 goals. About 30 Sevilla players have been chosen to play for the Spain national football team over the years.

Foreign players have always played an integral part in the success of Sevilla FC with Diego Maradona representing the most well known among them during his spell with the club during the 1992–93 season. During the same season, Sevilla FC was managed by Carlos Salvador Bilardo, a world champion manager.

Historically, Sevilla FC has fielded teams in a variety of other sports including: basketball, rugby, rowing, athletics, and weightlifting or petanca. Presently, Sevilla FC counts twenty-five professional teams on its ledgers (one of these being in the second national category) and a women&#x27;s football team in the Honor Division.

Sevilla FC&#x27;s stadium, the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, was inaugurated in 1958 and is one of the largest stadiums in Spain, and has the honor of hosting a World Cup semi-final match in 1982. After its final completion, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 75,000 spectators, but since its latest remodelling, the stadium has been converted to an all-seat with a covering added to the main seating area, reducing the capacity to its current count of 45,000 spectators.

===First successes===
Sevilla had their first spell of national success in the decade following the end of the Civil War, winning the 1945–46 La Liga title and two Copa del Rey titles. In the first season of this (1939–40), Sevilla won the cup on 25 June, beating Racing de Ferrol 6–2 in Barcelona. That same season, the side lost the Liga title on the last day to Atlético Madrid after drawing 3–3 against Hércules. The Sevilla forward line was known as &quot;los stukas&quot; after the German bomber aircraft, and scored 216 goals over four seasons. It comprised López, Torrontegui, Campanal, Raimundo, Berrocal and Pepillo.
In 1941, President Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán left the club to manage the Spanish Football Federation. After his departure, Antonio Sánchez Ramos occupied temporarily occupied the position until the permanent appointment of Jerónimo Domínguez y Pérez de Vargas, Marquess of Contadero, who was president of the club for six years until the return of Sánchez Pizjuán. Sevilla was runner-up to Athletic Bilbao in the 1942–43 season and came third a season later. Sevilla won its only Liga title in 1945–46, edging FC Barcelona by one point. Two years later, Sevilla won the 1948 Copa del Rey after beating Celta de Vigo 4–1 in Madrid on 4 July.

The most significant signing of those years was the Spanish international striker Juan Arza. There was also the debut of the Campanal&#x27;s nephew, defender Campanal II, with his uncle as a trainer. During the 1950–51 season, with Campanal acting as the coach, the team finished runner-up in La Liga, two points behind Atlético Madrid. Before the 1953–54 season, Argentinean coach Helenio Herrera was hired. During his time in charge, the club came fifth in the 1953–54 season, fourth in both 1954–55 and 1955–56 and second to Real Madrid in 1956–57. 

In 1954, the club put the construction of the new stadium out to tender because Nervión Stadium was becoming too small for the club&#x27;s fanbase. In the 1954–55 season, Arza won the Pichichi Trophy as La Liga&#x27;s top scorer, with 28 goals, and the team was runner-up in the Copa del Rey. In 1955, for the club&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a triangular tournament was organized against the French club Stade de Reims and the Swedish club IFK Norrköping; Sevilla won.

On 28 October 1956, President Sánchez Pizjuán suddenly died. As an appreciation to the deceased leader under whose chairmanship Sevilla had won three Copas del Rey, the fans decided that the club&#x27;s planned new stadium was to be named in his honour. In the 1956–57 season, the team were Liga runners-up behind Real Madrid, ensuring qualification for the first time to the European Cup. Herrera left the club at the end of the season. The club needed a victory on the final day of the next season to avoid relegation but reached the round of 8 of the European Cup before being knocked out by holders and eventual champions Real Madrid.

After the death of the President, Ramón de Carranza assumed the position for four years. It is said that he spoke these words at Sánchez Pizjuán&#x27;s tomb:

&quot;Dear Ramón, now your friends, among who I am honored to be one, is going to give you Christian burial, and on the following day, giving your body to the ground, we will start working and your dream that the Sevilla FC has a grand stadium will become a reality. Ramón, go in peace to heaven because your wishes will be fulfilled.&quot;

Being true to his words, Carranza made obligation bonds amounting to 50 million pesetas, and a month and a half after Sánchez Pizjuán&#x27;s death, the first stone in the stadium&#x27;s construction was placed. The architect was Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, co-designer of the recently built Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home of Real Madrid. The Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium was ultimately opened on 7 September 1958 as Sevilla played an inaugural friendly against fellow Andalusian club Real Jaén. The stadium&#x27;s first official match was on the opening day of the 1958–59 season, where Sevilla beat cross-city Real Betis 4–2.

===Crisis and stability===
In the 1970s, Sevilla was forced into selling its top players to pay off debts incurred from the construction of its new stadium; Manuel Ruiz Sosa transferred to Atlético Madrid, Gallego to Barcelona and Juan Batista Agüero to Real Madrid. Moreover, part of the adjacent land to the stadium was also sold to a bank. In the 1967–68 season, Sevilla returned to the Second Division for the first time in 31 years but was promoted back after one season. The next season, Austrian coach Max Merkel, nicknamed &quot;Mr. Whip&quot; for his usage of severe and harsh discipline techniques and training, was hired. 

That season, the club finished third in the league. However, the club was relegated again at the end of the 1972–73 season. In 1973, Sevilla signed their first-ever black player, Gambian winger Biri Biri, from the Danish club Boldklubben 1901. He remained at the club until 1978 and became a cult figure, with an ultra group named after him surviving to this day. In the 1974–75 season, with the Argentine Roque Olsen in charge, the club returned to the First Division. In the late 1970s, Sevilla signed Argentinians such as Héctor Scotta and Daniel Bertoni.

Directed first by Miguel Muñoz and later by Manolo Cardo, the team participated in two consecutive seasons of the UEFA Cup from 1981 to 1983. The 75th anniversary of the club was celebrated with a variety of social events and a match against the Brazilian side Santos. In 1982, the World Cup was held in Spain and Sevilla&#x27;s Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán was the venue for the semi-final match between West Germany and France. In 1984, Eugenio Montes Cabeza finished his 11-year presidency and was replaced by the cattle businessman Gabriel Rojas, who as the vice-president had made several advancements to the club&#x27;s stadium. In the 1985–86 season, Manolo Cardo left his management position after five years in charge, while Francisco played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup for Spain. Vicente Cantatore led the club to UEFA Cup qualification at the end of the 1989–90 season, with Austrian forward Toni Polster scoring a club-record 33 Liga goals. 

In the 1992–93 season, after several months of negotiations, world-renowned Argentine Diego Maradona signed from Napoli for a fee of $7.5 million. His time at the club, however, was unsuccessful, and he was released in large part due to his periodic injuries and clashes with coach Bilardo. In the following seasons, Luis Aragonés became manager and finished the 1994–95 season with qualification to next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

At the end of the 1994–95 season, despite the pleas of the club&#x27;s directors, Sevilla, along with Celta de Vigo, were one of two clubs relegated from the top flight on reasons of administration, provoking action from fans. The action resulted in both Sevilla and Celta being reinstated to La Liga.

These events led to an institutional instability, with the season seeing four presidents and three managers take charge. Sevilla was relegated at the end of the 1996–97 season but returned in 1999. At the beginning of the 21st century, the presidency of the club was assumed by the popular Roberto Alés. The situation of the club was very delicate at the time; the team had dropped back to the Second Division in 2000 and the squad was weakened by player retirements and the sales of key players. The club opted for a relatively unknown trainer, Joaquín Caparrós, who helped the team win the Second Division with three matches to spare in just his first season at the helm.

===Successes in the 21st century===
In May 2002, Roberto Alés resigned as president, and the Sevillian lawyer José María del Nido assumed the presidency. One of his first decisions was to confirm Caparrós as a coach and Monchi as sporting director.

On 6 October 2002, before a Seville derby against Betis at the Sánchez Pizjuán, four Sevilla fans, including a minor, assaulted a security guard. The attack was punished by Sevilla being forced to play their next four home matches behind closed doors, the longest term ever given to a La Liga side. The club finished sixth in the 2003–04 La Liga, giving the club qualification for the 2004–05 UEFA Cup and marking a return to continental competition for the first time since the 1995–96 season. In the 2004–05 league season, Sevilla finished sixth and qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, entering the competition in the third qualifying round.

This set up Sevilla&#x27;s first-ever European triumph in the 2006 UEFA Cup Final at the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven on 10 May 2006. The club defeated English club Middlesbrough 4–0 under new manager Juande Ramos, with the scoring opened by Brazilian striker Luís Fabiano. In the second-half, Italian substitute Enzo Maresca scored twice to be named Man of the Match, and Malian striker Frédéric Kanouté finished the scoring, to give the club its first major title in 58 years on the season of its centenary, which was celebrated in October 2005.

Sevilla opened their 2006–07 season by winning the 2006 UEFA Super Cup on 25 August 2006 with a 3–0 victory over Champions League winners and compatriots Barcelona at the Stade Louis II in Monaco. The goals were scored by Renato, Kanouté and a late penalty by Maresca. The season ended with a second consecutive UEFA Cup win, this time against fellow Spanish club Espanyol at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The match went to penalties after finishing 2–2 after extra-time, with Sevilla goalkeeper Andrés Palop saving three of Espanyol&#x27;s penalties.

On 12 November 2006, Sevilla played its 2,000th game in La Liga. Sevilla defeated Getafe in the 2007 Copa del Rey Final, with Kanouté scoring the only goal in the game&#x27;s 11th minute. Sevilla finished third in that season&#x27;s La Liga to qualify for the 2007–08 Champions League, returning to the competition for the first time in 50 years. As a result of these successes, Sevilla was voted as the IFFHS Team of the Year for the second consecutive season, becoming the first club to achieve this.

Sevilla won the 2007 Supercopa de España against La Liga champions Real Madrid. The season started to derail, however, after defender Antonio Puerta suffered a heart attack in the first game of the season and died three days later on 28 August. Three days after his death, Sevilla then lost 3–1 to Milan in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup in Monaco. Juande Ramos, the individual largely responsible for Sevilla&#x27;s recent successes, resigned as manager on 27 October to take the post with Tottenham Hotspur; he was replaced by Sevilla Atlético manager Manolo Jiménez. In spite of the personnel issues, Sevilla nonetheless advanced in first place in its Champions League group ahead of Arsenal before later being eliminated in the round of 16 via penalties to Fenerbahçe of Turkey.

In the summer of 2008, before Jiménez&#x27;s debut season as first-team manager, Dani Alves and Seydou Keita were both sold to Barcelona, while Christian Poulsen left for Juventus. Sevilla finished third in La Liga with a club record-equalling 21 victories and a club record number of away victories.

The 2009–10 season saw a third-consecutive qualification to the Champions League. On 19 May 2010, Sevilla defeated Atlético Madrid 2–0 in the 2010 Copa del Rey Final at Camp Nou, with goals from Diego Capel and Jesús Navas. Before the 2010–11 season started, Sevilla lost to Barcelona 5–3 on aggregate in the Supercopa and were eliminated in the Champions League playoffs by Portuguese club Braga.

===Unai Emery era===

On 14 January of the following year, after a 0–2 away loss to Valencia that left the Andalusians in 12th place, Jiménez was relieved of his duties, and was replaced by Spanish manager Unai Emery. The club went through an organizational financial crisis and was forced to sell team stars Álvaro Negredo and Jesús Navas, transactions that gave the club a combined €40 million; the duo was replaced by a contingent of younger players including strikers Carlos Bacca and Kevin Gameiro.

On 14 May 2014, Sevilla defeated Benfica on penalties in the 2014 UEFA Europa League Final to claim their third triumph in the competition. After this season key midfielder Ivan Rakitić was sold to Barcelona for around €16 million (the deal was closed on 16 June 2014). In summer 2015 top scorer Carlos Bacca, who had only joined two years previous, moved to Milan for €30 million. Despite these exits, the club acquired players Grzegorz Krychowiak and Éver Banega to reinforce the squad.

On 27 May 2015, Sevilla were again Europa League champions after defeating Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk 3–2 in the 2015 Final. The goals for Sevilla were scored by Grzegorz Krychowiak and a brace from Carlos Bacca. By defeating Dnipro, they became the only club to have won the Europa League four times.

The club returned to the Europa League final for a third consecutive time, facing Liverpool in the 2016 Final. After being down 0–1 at half-time, Sevilla bounced back in the second half to eventually win 3–1, with one goal scored from Kevin Gameiro and two from club captain Coke. With its third consecutive Europa League title, Sevilla improved its record of most Europa League titles won, having lifted the trophy five times in the span of ten years.

===Post-Emery era===
Despite Sevilla&#x27;s continued success in the Europa League, the 2015–16 season proved to be another finish outside the top four, the side finishing in seventh. In response, Castro decided to engineer a resurrection of the club. Jorge Sampaoli was hired as manager – replacing Paris Saint-Germain-bound Unai Emery – and the club began to invest heavily that summer. Additions to the side included goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu on loan, playmaker Ganso, forward Luciano Vietto and Wissam Ben Yedder, attacker Franco Vázquez, wide midfielders Hiroshi Kiyotake and Pablo Sarabia, as well as former Arsenal and Manchester City player Samir Nasri on loan. 

In December of the 2017–18 La Liga, Vincenzo Montella was named as the third manager since Emery&#x27;s departure in 2016 replacing Eduardo Berizzo. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League season, Sevilla progressed into the knockout stages of the competition, and defeated Manchester United in the Round of 16, reaching the round of 8 for the first time in 60 years, where they ultimately lost to Bayern Munich 2–1 on aggregate.

On 4 June 2019, Sevilla announced the signing of Julen Lopetegui as manager for the next three seasons. On 16 August 2020, Sevilla won 2–1 over Manchester United in the semi-finals of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, en route to lifting the trophy for a record sixth time, beating Inter Milan 3–2 in the final. 

On 31 May 2023, Sevilla clinched their record-extending 7th Europa League title with a win over Roma, drawing 1–1 after extra time and beating them 4–1 on penalties.

==Board and finances==
===Presidency===
Sevilla is governed by a presidential management system, but with a board of directors that discusses and approves those important decisions that must be carried out. The president is supported by a general director sometimes and a sports director.

Throughout its history, Sevilla has had 28 presidents, the first being Edward Farquharson Johnston, a Scotsman. Those who have occupied the presidency for the longest periods have been Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, Eugenio Montes Cabezas, José María del Nido Benavente, Luis Cuervas Vilches and José Castro Carmona.

In 1992, Sevilla FC became a Sporting Limited Association, following the entry into force of the law that regulated this kind of sporting companies, and therefore the system of election of the president was amended from being elected by the members to be elected by the shareholders of the club.

===Ownership===
* Sevillistas de Nervion S.A. (José María del Nido, Roberto Alés, José Castro, José Martín Baena, Francisco Guijarro, and José Gómez Miñán)
* Rafael Carrión Moreno 
* 777 Partners
* Accionistas Unidos (Supporters&#x27; Trust / Minor shareholders)

==Symbols==
===Anthems===

Sevilla has two official anthems:
* Official Anthem of Sevilla FC: This anthem dates back to the year 1983. The lyrics were written by Ángel Luis Osquiguilea de Roncales and the music was composed by Manuel Osquiguilea de Roncales.
* Centennial Anthem of Sevilla FC: Composed in 2005 by singer Javier Labandón &#x27;El Arrebato&#x27; to commemorate the centenary of the registration of the club&#x27;s articles of association, it became Spain&#x27;s number one single and the best-selling anthem of a football club in the entire history of Spanish football, reaching the 2nd position of the best-selling albums in 2006. On 9 October 2006, in the Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán, &#x27;El Arrebato&#x27; was awarded the golden record his anthem.

===Crest===
From its foundation, the team used a double-circled crest. On the exterior circle, the name of the club and the date of its foundation were written, while in the interior circle on a white background the letters &quot;SFC&quot; were interlaced as they are on the current crest. This first crest was designed by Juan Lafita, who was a close associate of the club and was the son of the Sevillian painter José Lafita y Blanco.

The second crest was designed in 1922 by Pablo Rodríguez Blanco, a draftsman of the Water Company. He divided the shield in three parts and together they formed the silhouette of a heart. The three figures that appear are the Christian saints portrayed on the coat of arms of the city – Isidore of Seville, Ferdinand III of Castile and Leander of Seville. On the right side appear the initials &quot;SFC,&quot; which were on the official shield from 1905 to 1922. 

Where the three parts meet, a football of the era appears. Regarding the red and white stripes, there are various theories, but it seems that the most coherent is that from the first time, the club wished that the official kit would be red and white. Another version indicates that the lower part is inspired on the flag which King Ferdinand III of Castile carried in the reconquest of Seville in 1248.

===Flag===
The definition of Sevilla&#x27;s flag is in the articles of association of 1982, which is a modification of the old ones which were formed and deposited in the Record of Associations and Sports Federations of the Higher Council of Sports. Its title 1, article 6 states that this is a distinctive emblem of the club:

:The flag, which will be rectangular, divided by a diagonal line that goes from the lower left angle to the upper right angle, which divides it into two triangles, the superior is white and the inferior red.

===Stadium===

In their first fifty years Sevilla played their home matches in various locations around Seville: la Trinidad Field, the Mercantile Field, &#x27;La Victoria&#x27; Stadium and the Estadio de Nervión.

The Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium was first planned in 1937 when the land was bought near to the then-home of Sevilla, in Nervión, and construction began in 1954. A contest was held for its design, won by the architect Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, who had also designed the home of Real Madrid, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

The construction of the stadium was completed in the summer of 1958 and was inaugurated on 7 September of the same year with a friendly match against Real Jaén. The east and west grandstands to the stadium were finished in 1974 under the presidency of Eugenio Montes Cabezas and increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 70,000. For the 1982 World Cup, capacity was reduced from 70,000 to 66,000, and things were added like new lighting, the visor, and the mosaic on the main façade (by Santiago del Campo). The stadium held two World Cup games; a group match between the Soviet Union and Brazil, as well as a semi-final between France and West Germany. 

The 1986 European Cup Final was held in the stadium, and won by Steaua București against Barcelona. The capacity of the stadium was reduced to approximately 60,000. The last big modification was made during the mid-1990s, when according to FIFA rules, all standing areas had to be redeveloped into seating, reducing the capacity to the present 42,714.

The Spain national team have played 26 matches in the stadium since 1961, unbeaten with 21 wins and 5 draws. To mark the club&#x27;s centenary in 2005, an allegorical mosaic designed by Ben Yessef was built above the southern gate, depicting the history of the city of Seville. Above it, the club&#x27;s badge floated in the wind. The stadium currently houses the headquarters of the club&#x27;s media, as well as an official store, club museum and trophy cabinet.

===Training facilities===
The sporting facilities known as La Ciudad Deportiva (The Sporting City) are used by the first team for training and by the reserve teams and women for matches. These facilities were inaugurated in 1974 and are located on the outskirts of the city on the road to Utrera. It has four natural grass pitches and three artificial pitches, as well as an artificial pitch for the Antonio Puerta Football School, changing rooms, gymnasium, press room, cafeteria, medical center and a recovering room.

==Support==
===Fans===
Since Sevilla became Sporting Limited Association, the concept of membership disappeared. Only the shareholders can take part in the decisions of the club according to the percentage of the capital they hold. The minority shareholders of the club are organised in a federation that represents them in the General Meeting of Shareholders that the club celebrates every year.

People who are traditionally referred to as members are currently fans who purchase a yearly season ticket which allows them to attend all home matches that season. Sometimes these members enjoy some specific advantages over the rest of the fans.

===Fan clubs===
Sevilla&#x27;s fan clubs are mainly concentrated in the city of Seville, its province and the rest of Andalusia. The presence of fan clubs in other autonomous communities is greater in Catalonia and Extremadura. Most of them are integrated into the &quot;San Fernando Fan Clubs Federation&quot; (Federación de Peñas Sevillistas &quot;San Fernando&quot;), which, according to its statutes, is totally independent from the directive board of the club, having its own board and not being intervened.

===Ultras===
The Biris Norte is an organized group of ultra supporters located in the North grandstand of the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán. The group&#x27;s name comes from the Gambian player Alhaji Momodo Njie, nicknamed Biri Biri, who became very popular among the Sevilla fans in the 1970s. The &quot;Biris Norte&quot; was created in the 1974–75 and is one of the oldest groups of Ultra fans in Spain.

===Rivalries===

Sevilla compete in the Seville derby against their cross-city rivals Real Betis. The two played each other for the first time on 8 October 1915 in a match which was won 4–3 by Sevilla. The game is considered one of the most important derbies in Spanish football. Sevilla also has a significant rivalry with Atlético Madrid and Valencia CF.

<text>Alprazolam, sold under the brand name Xanax among others, is a fast-acting, potent tranquilizer of moderate duration within the triazolobenzodiazepine group of chemicals called benzodiazepines. Alprazolam is most commonly prescribed in the management of anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea, together with other treatments. GAD improvement occurs generally within a week. Alprazolam is generally taken orally.
Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, suppressed emotions, mild to severe decreases in motor skills, hiccups, dulling or declining of cognition, decreased alertness, dry mouth (mildly), decreased heart rate, suppression of central nervous system activity, impairment of judgment (usually in higher than therapeutic doses), marginal to severe decreases in memory formation, decreased ability to process new information, as well as partial to complete anterograde amnesia, depending on dosage. Some of the sedation and drowsiness may improve within a few days.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased.
Alprazolam was invented by Jackson Hester Jr. at the Upjohn Company and patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. Alprazolam is a Schedule IV controlled substance and is a common drug of abuse. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 41st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 14million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Alprazolam is used in the management of anxiety disorders and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

===Panic disorder===
Alprazolam is effective in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. In Australia, alprazolam is not recommended for the treatment of panic disorder because of concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only four to ten weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to eight months without apparent loss of benefit.

Alprazolam is recommended by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder where there is no history of tolerance or dependence.

A 2023 meta-analysis of published and unpublished FDA-submitted regulatory trials of alprazolam extended-release for panic disorder found that only one of five clinical trials showed a positive efficacy outcome (20%), while the rest were negative and did not demonstrate effectiveness. In the published literature, three trials were published conveying a positive outcome (100%), but of these, only one was positive and the other two were considered to have been inappropriately spun as positive. The effect size (Hedges&#x27;s g) of alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorder based on the five clinical trials was 0.33 (a small effect) and based on the published trials was 0.47 (a moderate effect), equating to an increase of 0.14 or 42%. The authors concluded that publication bias substantially inflated the effectiveness of alprazolam for panic disorder.

===Anxiety disorders===
Anxiety associated with depression is responsive to alprazolam. Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness is limited to four months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression.

In the US, alprazolam is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

In the UK, alprazolam is indicated for short-term symptomatic treatment of anxiety in adults.

===Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting===
Alprazolam may be used in combination with other medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

==Contraindications==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in children and in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance use disorder history, particularly alcohol dependence, and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies such as cirrhosis, severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity, allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder, where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol.

Like all central nervous system depressants, alprazolam in larger-than-normal doses can cause significant deterioration in alertness and increase drowsiness, especially in those unaccustomed to the drug&#x27;s effects.

==Side effects==

Sedative drugs, including alprazolam, have been associated with an increased risk of death.

Possible side effects include:
* Anterograde amnesia 
* Concentration problems
* Ataxia 
* Dysarthria
* Disinhibition
* Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, ataxia, and vertigo
* Dry mouth (infrequent)
* Hallucinations (rare)
* Jaundice (very rare)
* Seizure (less common)
* Skin rash
* Respiratory depression 
* Constipation
* Suicidal ideation or suicide
* Urinary retention (infrequent)
*Muscle weakness

In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required that boxed warnings for all benzodiazepine medications be updated to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

===Paradoxical reactions===
Although unusual, the following paradoxical reactions have been shown to occur:
* Aggression
* Mania, agitation, hyperactivity, and restlessness
* Rage and hostility
* Twitches and tremor

===Food and drug interactions===
Alprazolam is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which may result in its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.

Imipramine and desipramine have been reported to increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alprazolam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of alprazolam and accumulation.

Alcohol is one of the most common interactions; alcohol and alprazolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another, which can cause severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. The more alcohol and alprazolam taken, the worse the interaction. Combination of alprazolam with the herb kava can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Plants in the genus &quot;Hypericum&quot;, including St. John&#x27;s wort, conversely can lower the plasma levels of alprazolam and reduce its therapeutic effect.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Benzodiazepines cross the placenta, enter the fetus, and are also excreted in breast milk.

The use of alprazolam during pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.

===Overdose===
The maximum recommended daily dose is 10 milligrams per day.

Overdoses of alprazolam can be mild to severe depending on the quantity ingested and if other drugs are taken in combination.

Alprazolam overdoses cause excess central nervous system (CNS) depression.

===Dependence and withdrawal===

The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the short half-life and rapid onset of action may increase the risk of misuse. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior.

Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.

Withdrawal and rebound symptoms commonly occur and necessitate a gradual reduction in dosage to minimize withdrawal effects when discontinuing.

Not all withdrawal effects are evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of symptoms such as anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence of the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug dependent.

Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines may also cause the development of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.

In 1992, Romach and colleagues reported that dose escalation is not a characteristic of long-term alprazolam users and that the majority of long-term alprazolam users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required.

Some common symptoms of alprazolam discontinuation include malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness.

Those taking more than 4 mg per day have an increased potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases have been known to cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause rebound anxiety.

In a 1983 study, only 5% of patients who abruptly ceased taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than eight months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% who had been taking them for more than eight months did. With alprazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, taken for eight weeks, 65% of patients experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.

The benzodiazepines diazepam and oxazepam have been found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam, temazepam, or lorazepam. Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.

==Pharmacology==

Alprazolam is a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator. When it binds to the receptor, effects of GABA are enhanced, leading to inhibition of neurons in the brain. This results in effects including reduced anxiety, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant activity. The activity of alprazolam in the central nervous system is dose-dependent.

===Mechanism of action===
Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolobenzodiazepine: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring attached to its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces a variety of therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor site and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates the inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The binding of alprazolam to the GABAA receptor, a chloride ion channel, enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter. When GABA binds the GABAA receptor the channel opens and chloride enters the cell which makes it more resistant to depolarisation. Therefore, alprazolam has a depressant effect on synaptic transmission to reduce anxiety.

The GABAA receptor is made up of 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam that have a triazole ring fused to their diazepine ring appear to have antidepressant properties. This is perhaps due to the similarities shared with tricyclic antidepressants, as they have two benzene rings fused to a diazepine ring. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.

Giving alprazolam, as compared to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Alprazolam is taken orally, and is absorbed well – 80% of alprazolam binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after one to two hours.

Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, mostly by the cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, as well as an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.

The metabolites and some unmetabolized alprazolam are filtered out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine.

==Chemistry==
===Physical properties===
Alprazolam is a triazole and benzodiazepine derivative substituted with a phenyl group at position 6, with a chlorine atom at position 8, and with a methyl group at position 1. It is an analogue of triazolam, the difference between them being the absence of a chlorine atom in the ortho position of the phenyl ring. It is slightly soluble in chloroform, soluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in acetone and insoluble in water. It has a melting point of .

===Synthesis===
For the synthesis of alprazolam the same method can be used as for triazolam, excepting that it starts from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone. However, an alternative easier synthesis starting with 2,6-dichloro-4-phenylquinoline has been suggested, in which it reacts with hydrazine giving 6-chloro-2-hydrazino-4-phenylquinoline. Boiling the mixture with triethyl orthoacetate results in cyclization with the formation of the triazole ring. The product undergoes oxidative degradation in the presence of periodate and ruthenium dioxide in acetone solution, giving 2-[4-(3&#x27;-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone. Oxy-methylation with formaldehyde results in a product that is treated with phosphorus tribromide when 2-[4-(3&#x27;-methyl-5&#x27;-bromomethyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone is obtained. By substituting the bromine atom with an amino group conferred by ammonia, it forms alprazolam triazolobenzophenone, following which an intramolecular heterocyclization takes place to obtain alprazolam.

===Detection===
Quantification of alprazolam in blood and plasma samples may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of intoxication in hospitalized patients, or to provide evidence in the case of crimes e.g., impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a thorough forensic investigation, e.g., in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually in a range of 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2,000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most of the commercial immunoassays used for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitative determination are usually done by chromatographic techniques.

==Dosage forms==
Alprazolam regular release and orally disintegrating tablets are available as 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets. Extended-release tablets are available as 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg tablets. Liquid alprazolam is available in a 1 mg/mL oral concentrate.

==Legal status==
Alprazolam has varied legal status depending on jurisdiction:
* In the United States, alprazolam is a prescription drug and is assigned to Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
* Under the UK drug misuse classification system, alprazolam is a Class C drug. In the UK, alprazolam is not available on the National Health Service (NHS) and can only be obtained on a private prescription.
* In Ireland, alprazolam is a Schedule 4 medicine.
* In Sweden, alprazolam is a prescription drug in List IV (Schedule 4) under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968).
* In the Netherlands, alprazolam is a List 2 substance of the Opium Law and is available for prescription.
* In Germany, alprazolam can be prescribed normally in doses up to 1 mg. Higher doses are scheduled as Anlage III drugs and require a special prescription form.
* In Australia, alprazolam, as of February 2014, is a Schedule 8 medication.
* In the Philippines, alprazolam is legally classified as a &quot;dangerous drug&quot; under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, along with other schedule drugs listed in the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The importation of dangerous drugs including alprazolam, requires authorization from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.

Internationally, alprazolam is included under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as Schedule IV.

==Availability==
In December 2013, in anticipation of the rescheduling of alprazolam to Schedule 8 in Australia, Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it was no longer commercially viable.

==Recreational use==

There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam&#x27;s high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of alprazolam also add to its addictive nature. In the small subgroup of individuals who escalate their doses, there is usually a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders.

Despite this, most prescribed alprazolam users do not use their medication recreationally, and the long-term use of benzodiazepines does not generally correlate with the need for dose escalation. However, based on US findings from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), an annual compilation of patient characteristics in substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States, admissions due to &quot;primary tranquilizer&quot; (including, but not limited to, benzodiazepine-type) drug use increased 79% from 1992 to 2002, suggesting that misuse of benzodiazepines may be on the rise.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an 89 percent increase in emergency room visits nationwide related to nonmedical benzodiazepine use between 2004 and 2008.

Alprazolam is one of the most commonly prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration concluded that, in the US, benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency department visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.
Those at particularly high risk for misuse and dependence are people with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse and/or dependence and people with borderline personality disorder.

The poly-drug use of powerful depressant drugs poses the highest level of health concerns due to a significant increase in the likelihood of experiencing an overdose, which may cause fatal respiratory depression.

A 1990 study found that diazepam has a higher misuse potential relative to many other benzodiazepines and that some data suggest that alprazolam and lorazepam resemble diazepam in this respect.

Anecdotally, injection of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure of blood vessels (embolization), and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water; when crushed in water, it does not fully dissolve (40 μg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There are also reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper in a manner similar to LSD.

Misuse of alprazolam and other benzodiazepines has been shown to cause cognitive impairment. Alprazolam has typically caused anterograde amnesia effects (inability to recall new events), but a study conducted on mice by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Research at Punjabi University has also determined that alprazolam can produce retrograde amnesic effects (inability to remember events occurring before amnesia). One 2016 study found that &quot;chronic administration of alprazolam affects memory but attentive and psychomotor performance remained unaffected&quot;.

A 2016 randomized controlled trial stated that &quot;overall, long-term benzodiazepine users may not be in their full cognitive state upon withdrawal&quot;. Similarly, a 2017 meta-analysis concluded that &quot;a range of neuropsychological functions are impaired as a result of long-term benzodiazepine use, and that these are likely to persist even following withdrawal&quot;.

===Slang terms===
Slang terms for alprazolam vary by geographic location. Some of the more common terms are modified versions of the trade name &quot;Xanax&quot;, such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Xans, Z-bars, handlebars, beans, footballs, planks, poles, sticks, blues, or blue footballs.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Take Your Pills: Xanax&quot;, a 2022 Netflix documentary, provides an overview of the drug&#x27;s history and usage.

<text>Community-supported agriculture (CSA model) or cropsharing is a system that connects producers and consumers within the food system closer by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of agriculture and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming. The model is a subcategory of civic agriculture that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of community through local markets.

Community-supported agriculture can be considered as a practice of Commoning. It is an example of community-led management of the production and distribution of goods and services. The organization of food provisioning through commoning is complementary to the horizontal axis of market mediated food provisioning and the verticality of the state distribution and regulation on food. As a model where market agents do not interact solely as competitors but as “members of a community collaborating in pursuing a collective action for the commonwealth” it is also recognized and supported by public policies in some countries. Such frameworks of collaboration between public administration and the cooperative sector are known as Public-Commons-Partnerships (PCP) and have also been established in relation to food. As a prefigurative practice that decommodifies food and “strengthens the imaginary of community as a source of reward and space of emancipation“ CSA has been acknowledged as an important step-stone in a sustainability transition in agri-food systems.

In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits, vegetables, and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.

The term CSA is mostly used in the United States, Canada and the UK but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide and in Austria and Germany as &quot;Solidarische Landwirtschaft&quot; (, abbreviated to &quot;Solawi&quot;).

==History==

The term &quot;community-supported agriculture&quot; was coined in the northeastern United States in the 1980s, influenced by European biodynamic agriculture ideas formulated by Rudolf Steiner. Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s. Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named Topinambur located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term &quot;community-supported agriculture&quot; stems from Vander Tuin. This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at Great Barrington was created in Massachusetts by Jan Vander Tuin, Susan Witt, and Robyn Van En. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm was created in New Hampshire by Anthony Graham, Trauger Groh, and Lincoln Geiger.
The CSA Garden at Great Barrington remained together until 1990 when many members left to form the Mahaiwe Harvest CSA. One of the original founders, Robyn Van En, became incredibly influential in the CSA movement in America and founded CSA North America in 1992. The Temple-Wilton Community Garden was more successful and still operates as a CSA today. It became an important member of the Wilton community and it receives funding from state, federal, and local sources.

A parallel model called Teikei existed in Japan as early as the mid-1960s. Similarly, Dr. Booker T. Whatley, a professor of agriculture in Alabama, advocated for Clientele Membership Clubs as early as the 1960s.

Since the 1980s, community supported farms have been organized throughout North America—mainly in New England, the Northwest, the Pacific coast, the Upper-Midwest and Canada. North America now has at least 13,000 CSA farms of which 12,549 are in the US according to the United States Department of Agriculture in 2007. The rise of CSAs seems to be correlated with the increase in awareness of the environmental movement in the United States, and because food acquisition from local sources can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, CSAs contribute to climate change mitigation. CSAs have even become popular in urban environments such as the New York City Coalition Against Hunger&#x27;s CSA program that helps serve under-served communities. One of the largest subscription CSAs was Capay Inc. in Capay Valley, California which in 2010 delivered boxes to 13,000 customers a week as well as selling at 15 farmers markets, operating a retail store, and delivering special orders to restaurants.

Urgenci, based in France, helps network together consumers and producers across Europe, the Mediterranean, and West Africa.

CSA was introduced to China following a series of food safety scandals in the late 2000s. It was estimated that there were more than 500 CSA farms in China by 2017. They have been a critical force in the development of the organic and ecological farming in China. Chinese CSA farmers, researchers and civil society organizations gather annually at the national CSA symposium held since 2009.

Much of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the &quot;male dominated field of conventional agriculture&quot;. In community supported agriculture women represent 40 percent of farm operators.

== International ==
Even if the systems of community-supported agriculture vary in different countries, there are a number of umbrella-organizations connecting the farms. In the United States the governmental program SARE offered grants for research and education projects that advance sustainable agricultural practices like CSA.

In Germany and Austria the CSA groups founded the &quot;Bundesnetzwerk Solidarische Landwirtschaft&quot; (Federal Network of CSA-farms) in 2011.

== Switzerland ==
In Switzerland, community farming is often referred to as &quot;Solidarische Landwirtschaft&quot; (, abbreviated to &quot;Solawi&quot;). Among others there are two important forms of organization for CSA in Switzerland: the cooperative and the individual initiative.

Food cooperatives are the oldest form of organization and the first CSA projects in Switzerland were organized as cooperatives. They belong to the category of farmer-shareholder cooperatives. Cooperatives are based on direct cooperation between farmers and consumers. Consumers or cooperative members actively participate in the management of agricultural production together with the producers. Producers assume the day-to-day management and work on the farm and are often formally employed by the cooperative, as well as being part of it. Cooperative members participate in production and distribution costs by purchasing shares in the cooperative and paying annual fees for the delivery of vegetables. Cooperative members also participate in some production or distribution tasks as part of their commitment to the cooperative.

Some CSAs are also initiated by producers, often created to open a new distribution channel. This form of organization is often referred to as farmer-run CSAs. Producers offer baskets with the farm&#x27;s produce to any interested consumer (consumers are not organized, but have individual contracts with the farmer).The baskets with vegetables and/or fruits are delivered to consumers on a regular basis. The distribution and management of production is the responsibility of the producer and there is usually no collaboration or shared investment between consumers and producers. For the producer it means a capacity and possibility to diversify production and has the advantage of a new distribution channel with very low entry costs.

=== Regional networks in Switzerland ===
The &quot;Fédération Romande d&#x27;Agriculture Contractuelle de Proximité&quot; (FRACP) is a French-speaking federation of CSAs and supports the creation of new CSAs. It was created in 2008 with 13 CSA groups as founding members. FRACP is sponsored by Uniterre, a small farmers&#x27; union that is part of La Via Campesina and promotes the concept of food sovereignty.

&quot;Verband Regionale Vertragslandwirtschaft&quot; (RVL) is a German-speaking organization created in 2011 with the help of FRACP. RVL collaborates with the &quot;Kooperationsstelle für solidarische Landwirtschaft&quot; and offers courses on community supported agriculture.

== Italy ==

The CSA (Community-Supported Agriculture) model in Italy is a relatively young movement that began to gain traction in 2011.

The first CSA established in Italy was the C.A.P.S. (Agrarian Community of Social Promotion) in Pisa, while the largest CSA is Arvaia in Bologna, boasting 220 active members and 500 associates. As of 2021, a survey conducted by Numes, a project born in collaboration with the Arvaia CSA, identified 15 formal CSAs, although the actual number is likely higher.

It is closely connected to the history of GAS (Gruppi di acquisto solidale) – Solidarity Purchase Groups). GAS and CSA share similar ethical values and organizational structures, operating based on principles of solidarity, mutuality, and sustainability. However, there are distinct differences between CSAs and GASs in terms of risk-sharing. In a CSA, members choose to provide financial support to farmers, thereby sharing the risks inherent in agricultural work. On the other hand, GAS members do not enter into a formal contract that obligates them to share any potential costs.

== United Kingdom ==
The UK&#x27;s first CSA was established in Findhorn, Scotland in 1994. The national umbrella organisation was set up in 2013 - this is the Community Supported Agriculture Network . This network aims to help people set up their CSAs, as well as providing helpful information to help these relations to run more successfully. Registered CSAs are mostly distributed across the east of Scotland. Yet, it is likely there are many more ‘informal’ CSAs on the west coast and the Isles. Across Wales and Northern Ireland, CSA&#x27;s are spread evenly. In England, most CSA&#x27;s are located in the South East. CSA enterprises across the UK have been growing fast, with most of the farm to community connections beginning and remaining as grassroots initiates, despite limited funding from government or private sector.

=== Funding ===
Support came from the Soil Association’s programme within the Big Lottery funded “Making Local Food Work” scheme which ran from 2007 to 2012. This supported the growth of CSAs across each of the countries, through providing funding that enabled the use of community and social enterprise approaches to link consumers and producers in the local food-related third sector.

== Socio-economic model ==
CSAs create direct connections between producers and consumers through alternative markets and the members and farmers share the risk of farming. The goals of the first CSA model in the US were to have the producer and consumer to come into the market as equals and make an exchange with fair prices and fair wages.

The consumer pays for things such as transparency, environmental stewardship, producer relationships, etc. The farmers engaged in CSAs do so to fulfill goals other than income and are not compensated fairly in these exchanges. This kind of market holds &quot;economic rents&quot; where the consumer surplus comes from the consumers&#x27; willingness to pay for something further than the product as well as for the products inputs themselves. Although these markets still exist within a larger capitalist economy, they are able to exist because of the &quot;economic rents&quot; that are collected.

==CSA system==
CSAs generally focus on the production of high quality foods for a local community, often using organic or biodynamic farming methods, and a shared risk membership–marketing structure. This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual—resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship. The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season&#x27;s budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste.

===Structure===
Community-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant. The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.

From this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed:

* Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.
* Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.
* Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.
* Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.

In most original CSAs, a core group of members existed. This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions. CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful. However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members. CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.

===Ideology===

Community-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of anthroposophy and biodynamic agriculture. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:

* New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers
* New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees
* New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise

As CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically. While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy. This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs. The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA. The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.

===Distribution and marketing methods===

Shares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps. Share prices vary from CSA to CSA. Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people. Prices range from $200 to $500 per season. Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250. Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community. Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options.

Shares are distributed in several different ways. Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm. Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers&#x27; markets, and community center/church dropoff. For example, the new &quot;Farmie Markets&quot; of upstate New York take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week&#x27;s orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers.

CSAs market their farms and shares in different ways. CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions. CSAs use local farmers&#x27; markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over-production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers&#x27; markets. Excess products are sometimes given to food banks.

=== Challenges for farmers ===
Many CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more (an economic rent if this puts the price above the cost of production) if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it. However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt&#x27;s 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers charged lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security. This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see moral economy.

<doc id="243519" wikidata="Q33430" url="?curid=243519" title="Kwa languages">
<text>The Kwa languages, often specified as New Kwa, are a proposed but as-yet-undemonstrated family of languages spoken in the south-eastern part of Ivory Coast, across southern Ghana, and in central Togo. The Kwa family belongs to the Niger-Congo phylum. The name was introduced in 1895 by Gottlob Krause and derives from the word for &#x27;people&#x27; (&quot;Kwa&quot;) in many of these languages, as illustrated by Akan names. This branch consists of around 50 different languages spoken by about 25 million people. Some of the largest Kwa languages are Ewe, Akan and Baule.

==Languages==
See the box at right for a current classification.

The various clusters of languages included in Kwa are at best distantly related, and it has not been demonstrated that they are closer to each other than to neighboring Niger–Congo languages.

Stewart distinguished the following major branches, which historical-comparative analysis supports as valid groups:
*Potou–Tano (including Akan)
*Ga–Dangme
*Na-Togo
*[formerly] Gbe (inclusion doubtful, as they show more features of Kwa the closer one moves to Akan)
The Lagoon languages of southern Ivory Coast are not particularly close to any of these, nor to each other, so they are left ungrouped: 
*Avikam–Alladian
*Attié
*Abé
*Adjukru
*Abidji
*Ega
An Esuma language, extinct ca. 1800, remains unclassified.

Since Stewart, Ega has been tentatively removed, the Gbe languages reassigned to Volta–Niger, and Apro added. Some of the Na-Togo and Ka-Togo languages have been placed into separate branches of Kwa. See the infobox at right for the resulting branches.

Ethnologue divides the Kwa languages into two broad geographical groupings: Nyo and Left bank, but this is not a genealogical classification. The Nyo group collapses Stewart&#x27;s Potou–Tano and Ga–Dangme branches and also includes the ungrouped languages of southern Ivory Coast, while the Ka/Na-Togo and Gbe languages are called &quot;Left bank&quot; because they are spoken to the east of the Volta River.

==History of the proposal==
The word &#x27;Kwa&#x27; was used by Gottlob Krause in 1885 for the Akan (or perhaps Tano), Gã, and Gbe languages, which have &quot;kwa&quot; or &quot;kua&quot; as their word for &#x27;human being&#x27;. Since then the proposal has been dramatically expanded, only to revert to something approaching its initial conception.

In 1952 Westermann and Bryan expanded Kwa to the various Lagoon languages of southern Ivory Coast and to what are now called the Volta–Niger languages of southern Nigeria. Greenberg (1963) added the Kru languages of Liberia, the Ghana–Togo Mountain languages which Westermann and Bryan had specifically excluded, and Ijaw of the Niger delta; West Kwa included the languages from Liberia to Dahomey (Republic of Benin), and East Kwa the languages of Nigeria. Bennett &amp; Sterk (1977) proposed that the Yoruboid and Igboid languages belonged in Benue–Congo rather than in Kwa. Stewart (1989) removed Kru, Ijaw, and Volta–Niger (East Kwa), but kept the Ghana–Togo Mountain and Lagoon languages, as well as adding a few obscure, newly described languages. Stewart&#x27;s classification is the basis of more recent conceptions. To disambiguate this from Greenberg&#x27;s influential classification, the reduced family is sometimes called &quot;New Kwa&quot;.

<doc id="243536" wikidata="Q6942158" url="?curid=243536" title="Music of Louisiana">
<text>The music of Louisiana can be divided into three general regions: rural south Louisiana, home to Creole Zydeco and Old French (now known as cajun music), New Orleans, and north Louisiana. The region in and around Greater New Orleans has a unique musical heritage tied to Dixieland jazz, blues, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms. The music of the northern portion of the state starting at Baton Rouge and reaching Shreveport has similarities to that of the rest of the US South.

==New Orleans (Traditional Genres)==

In the 19th century, there was already a mixture of French, Spanish, African and Afro-Caribbean music. The city had a great love for Opera; many operatic works had their first performances in the New World in New Orleans.

===Early African, Caribbean and Creole music===
Unlike in the Protestant colonies of what would become the USA, African slaves and their descendants were not prohibited from performing their traditional music in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. The African slaves, many from the Caribbean islands, were allowed to gather on Sundays, their day off, on a plaza known as Congo Square. Permitted as early as 1817, dancing in New Orleans had been restricted to the square, which was a hotbed of musical fusion, as African styles from across America and the Caribbean met and danced in large groups, often in circle dances. The Congo Square gatherings became well known, and many whites came to watch and listen. Nevertheless, by 1830, opposition from whites in New Orleans and an influx of blacks from elsewhere in the U.S. caused the decline of Congo Square&#x27;s prominence. The tradition of mass dances in Congo Square continued sporadically, though it came to have more in common with minstrelsy than with authentic African traditions.

Caribbean dances known to have been imported to Louisiana include the calenda, Congo, counjai, and bamboula.

Louis Gottschalk was an early 19th-century White Creole pianist and composer from New Orleans, the first American musician/composer to become famous in Europe. A number of his works incorporate rhythms and music he heard performed by African slaves.

In addition to the slave population, antebellum New Orleans also had a large population of free people of color, mostly Creoles of mixed African and European heritage who worked as tradesmen. The more prosperous Creoles sent their children to be educated in France. They had their own dance bands, an opera company, and a symphony orchestra. The community produced such composers as Edmund Dede and Basil Bares. After the American Civil War many Creole musicians became music teachers, teaching the use of European instruments to the newly freed slaves and their descendants.

===Jazz===

Probably the single most famous style of music to originate in the city was New Orleans jazz, also known as Dixieland. It came into being around 1900. Many with memories of the time say that the most important figure in the formation of the music was Papa Jack Laine who enlisted hundreds of musicians from all of the city&#x27;s diverse ethnic groups and social status. Most of these musicians became instrumental in forming jazz music including Buddy Bolden, Bunk Johnson and the members of Original Dixieland Jazz Band. One of early rural blues, ragtime, and marching band music were combined with collective improvisation to create this new style of music. At first, the music was known by various names such as &quot;hot music&quot;, &quot;hot ragtime&quot; and &quot;ratty music&quot;; the term &quot;jazz&quot; (early on often spelled &quot;jass&quot;) did not become common until the 1910s. The early style was exemplified by the bands of such musicians as Freddie Keppard, Jelly Roll Morton, &quot;King&quot; Joe Oliver, Kid Ory. The next generation took the young art form into more daring and sophisticated directions, with such creative musical virtuosos as Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Red Allen.

New Orleans was a regional Tin Pan Alley music composing and publishing center through the 1920s, and was also an important center of ragtime. Louis Prima demonstrated the versatility of the New Orleans tradition, taking a style rooted in traditional New Orleans jazz into swinging hot music popular into the rock and roll era. He is buried in New Orleans. Contemporary jazz has had a following in New Orleans with musicians such as Alvin Batiste and Ellis Marsalis. Some younger jazz virtuosos such as Wynton Marsalis and Nicholas Payton experiment with the avant garde while refusing to disregard the traditions of early jazz.

Continuing development of the traditional New Orleans jazz style, Tom McDermott, Evan Christopher, New Orleans Nightcrawlers.

Harry Connick Jr. was raised in New Orleans and attended Loyola University New Orleans.

===New Orleans blues===

The blues that developed in the 1940s and 1950s in and around the city of New Orleans was strongly influenced by jazz and incorporated Caribbean influences, it is dominated by piano and saxophone but has also produced major guitar bluesmen. Major figures in the genre include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim, who both produced major regional, R&amp;B and national hits. Louisiana blues created a specialized form of blues music sometimes using zydeco instrumentation and slow, tense rhythms that is closely related to New Orleans blues and swamp blues from Baton Rouge.

===R&amp;B/gospel===
Allen Toussaint composed or produced many songs, including &quot;Mother-in-Law&quot;, &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;, &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, &quot;Ride Your Pony&quot;, &quot;Get Out of My Life, Woman&quot;, &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot;, &quot;Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky&quot;, &quot;Freedom For the Stallion&quot;, &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot;, and &quot;Southern Nights&quot;. He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, for example &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, by his longtime friend Dr. John (&quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack), and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by Labelle. The Meters, Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe gained hit songs. New band Galactic released jazz funk album.
The city also has a rich tradition of gospel music and spirituals; Mahalia Jackson was the most famous of New Orleans&#x27; gospel singers. She is buried in Metairie.

The Dixie Cups had a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; in 1964. They also recorded the song &quot;Iko Iko&quot; about Mardi Gras. In the 1950s, New Orleans again influenced the national music scene as a center in the development of rhythm and blues. Important artists included Fats Domino (d. 2017), Snooks Eaglin, Dave Bartholomew, Professor Longhair, and Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith.

Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John a New Orleans-born singer/songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combined blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll. Dr. John cited Professor Longhair as one of his musical influences and has recorded a number of his compositions, most notably &quot;Tipitina&quot;.

1980s new style of &quot;street beat&quot; brass bands combining the jazz brass band tradition with funk and hip hop was spearheaded by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, then the Rebirth Brass Band.

==New Orleans (Modern Genres)==

===Rock/pop===
Significant New Orleans rock band, and alternative bands include Zebra, The Radiators, Better Than Ezra (singer Kevin Griffin graduated from Louisiana State University in 1990), 12 Stones, and Cowboy Mouth. Popular alternative rock bands include Mutemath and Meriwether.

Louisiana is known as the most important place for the development of a style of heavy metal: sludge metal. Two of its founding acts, Eyehategod and Crowbar, are from New Orleans, where the genre&#x27;s most important scene can be found. Other notable sludge metal bands such as Acid Bath, Down, Soilent Green and Choke are based in Louisiana. Blackened death metal band Goatwhore are from New Orleans.

Britney Spears (from Kentwood) has had four #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including the dance-pop song &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; from 1999. R&amp;B singer Frank Ocean had a #1 album on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Blonde&quot; in 2016.

=== Hip-hop ===

Beginning in the mid-1990s, New Orleans became a hub of Southern hip hop. First with Master P and his No Limit clique based out of the 3rd Ward, then later came the Cash Money clique who popularized a unique semi-melodic Louisianian style of rapping to the hip hop mainstream. The city has also been a center of Southern hip hop, and the birthplace of mainstream Bounce music which originated in New Orleans.

The rapper Juvenile had a #1 hit on the Hot 100 with &quot;Slow Motion&quot; ft. Soulja Slim, from 2004 and a #1 album on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Reality Check&quot; in 2006. Lil Wayne became one of the most prominent New Orleans rappers in the mid-2000s. He has had two #1 hits on the Hot 100, including &quot;Lollipop&quot; from 2008.

==Southern region (Traditional Genres)==

The music of rural south Louisiana features significant input from non-Creoles, most notably African Americans who are critical to the cultural/musical identity. Four main musical genres are indigenous to this area — Creole music (i.e. zydeco), swamp pop, and swamp blues. These historically-rooted genres, with unique rhythms and personalities, have been transformed with modern sounds and instruments. The southwestern and south central Louisiana areas herald many artists and songs that have become international hits, won Grammy awards, and become highly sought after by collectors.

In southwestern Louisiana in the 1800s, the fiddle was the most popular Cajun instrument and the music still carried clear influences from the Poitou region of France and the Scottish/Canadian influences of their earlier homeland. In the late 19th century German immigrants spreading outward from central and eastern Texas and New Orleans soon brought the accordion as well. Creoles at the time sang a rhythmic type of song called juré. When accordion, fiddle and the triangle iron were added later, the music evolved into French music or form la la, a central component of Creole music. La la was primarily rural, played at house dances also known as &quot;la las&quot;, and found in towns in the prairie regions like Mamou, Eunice and Opelousas.

In 1901 (see 1901 in music), oil was discovered at Jennings and immigration boomed. Many of the newcomers were white businessmen from outside of Louisiana who attempted to force the Creoles and Cajuns to adopt the dominant American cultural forms, even outlawing the use of the French language in 1916. Despite the law, many Creoles and Cajuns still spoke French at home, and musical performances were in French.

===Creole music===

The term &quot;Creole music&quot; is used to describe both the early folk or roots music traditions of French and Metis rural Creoles of South Louisiana and the later more contemporary genre called zydeco. It was often simply called French music or La La. It was sung in French patois by Creoles. This early American roots music evolved in the 1930s into a richer sound accompanied by more instruments. Creole pioneer Amédé Ardoin was the music&#x27;s most influential figure and one of the earliest to make recordings, second only to the duo of Douglas Bellard and Kirby Riley. He has also been credited for greatly influencing the foundation of Cajun music. Creole music traditions in the US have been known to change and evolve as quickly as they were being replicated by white artists, the music of the Creoles also evolved into a more contemporary amplified sound that was later called zydeco, which is the indigenous music of the Creoles or &quot;Creole music&quot;. Zydeco comes from French &quot;les haricots&quot;, meaning snap or green beans as in &quot;les haricots (ne) sont pas salés&quot; (the beans are not seasoned (with salt pork) because times are hard right now). Zydeco fused the traditional Creole roots music sung in French with contemporary sounds of blues and rhythm and blues making it relevant, dynamic and constantly attracting a new generation of listeners within the Creole community as well as outside the community. This fusion was birthed in the Creole la la, jazz and blues halls (joints) of Frenchtown, Houston, Texas which were frequented by Creole immigrants from southwestern Louisiana. Clifton Chenier, born near Opelousas, Louisiana, is regarded as the &quot;King of Zydeco&quot; and was largely responsible for defining and popularizing the genre in the mid- to late 1950s and 1960s.

===Cajun music===

Cajun music is rooted in the music of the preexisting Creoles and the French-speaking Catholics of eastern Canada and became transformed into a unique sound of the Cajun culture. In earlier years of the late 18th century the fiddle was the predominant instrument and the music tended to sound more like early country music. Cajun music is typically a waltz or two step. Unlike the folk music of Quebec, it is not associated with the Celtic tradition. Famous Cajun musicians were Lawrence Walker, Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Aldus Roger, Marc Savoy, Wilson Savoy, Dewey Segura, Wayne Toups.

===Zydeco===

Early in the 1950s, zydeco evolved from the music of the Creoles in southwest and south central Louisiana. At an earlier period, Creole and Cajun music were more similar, but after World War II, this regional French music evolved into a distinct expression of the Creoles, Louisianians whose shared languages and culture transcend race. Along with the accordion, the second main instrument in a zydeco group is a corrugated metal washboard, called a Zydeco Rubboard or &quot;frottoir&quot;. They made the music contemporary by adding electrical instruments (guitar and bass), keyboards, drumkit and even sometimes horns. The Creole Zydeco music of Grammy-winning artists Queen Ida Guillory, Clifton Chenier, Rockin&#x27; Sidney Simien, Buckwheat Zydeco and Terrance Simien remain some of the most internationally recognized zydeco music. John Delafose, Andrus Espree (aka Beau Jocque), Boozoo Chavis, Rosie Ledet, Chubby Carrier, Canray Fontenot, Amédé Ardoin, Rockin&#x27; Dopsie, Geno Delafose, Nathan Williams, Keith Frank, Chris Ardoin, Nathan Williams Jr., J Paul Jr., Cedric Watson and Jeffery Broussard are also other well known zydeco musicians.

===Swing Out===
Swing out can be classified as a cross between the music genres of southwest Louisiana including Zydeco and Southern Soul. It is especially popular in the Acadiana region, being that so many artists originate and perform in this part of the state. Its popularity has caused an expansion of the music throughout the southern portion of the United States. Swing out music is usually produced and doesn&#x27;t involve the use of live instruments unlike zydeco. Notable artists include Tucka James, Roi &quot;Chip&quot; Anthony, &quot;Lysa&quot; Harrington, and AudiYo.

===Swamp blues===

Swamp blues developed around Baton Rouge in the 1950s and reached a peak of popularity in the 1960s. It generally has a slow tempo and incorporates influences from other genres of music, particularly the regional styles of zydeco and Cajun music. Its most successful proponents included Slim Harpo and Lightnin&#x27; Slim, who enjoyed a number of rhythm and blues and national hits and whose work was frequently covered by bands of the British Invasion.

===Swamp pop===

Swamp pop came about in the mid-1950s. With the Cajun dance and musical conventions in mind, nationally popular African American music genres such as rock, pop, country, and R&amp;B songs were re-recorded, sometimes in French. Swamp pop is more of a combination of many influences, and the bridge between zydeco, New Orleans second line, and rock and roll. The song structure is pure rock and roll, the rhythms are distinctly New Orleans based, the chord changes, vocals and inflections are R&amp;B influenced, and the lyrics are sometimes French.

Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry&#x27;s &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Know Why) But I Do&quot; and &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; (both Bobby Charles compositions). Phil Phillips&#x27; gained big hit &quot;Sea of Love&quot;. Swamp pop also left its imprint on the related but distinct genre known as &quot;swamp blues&quot;, including Slim Harpo&#x27;s classic &quot;Rainin&#x27; in My Heart&quot;. Swamp blues/Swamp pop/Swamp R&amp;B type songs such as the Cookie and the Cupcakes hit &quot;Mathilda&quot;, Johnnie Allan&#x27;s &quot;Mathilda&quot; and Dale &amp; Grace &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving up to You&quot;.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; covered Barbara Lynn&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose a Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Oh Baby (We Got A Good Thing Goin&#x27;)&quot;.

==Southern region (Modern Genres) ==

===Country music===
Sammy Kershaw, Eddy Raven, Jo-el Sonnier, and the band River Road are all Acadiana natives who went on to score national fame and sell millions of records via the major labels in Nashville.

===Dance and Rave music===
Southern Louisiana, especially around Lafayette had a significant rave scene in the late 1990s into the early 2000s. At its peak, dance-based DJ sets were featured most weekend evenings on KSMB and gained near-mainstream appeal. Local dance and rave scenes primarily centered on Florida breaks, and also incorporated trance music and occasionally mainstream house or other dance tracks as well. Notable DJs included DJ Trashy, DJ Digital, DJ Johnny Cage, and DJ Moon.

=== Hiphop ===

Southern Louisiana has vibrant hiphop scenes in most areas.

Baton Rouge in particular is home to a number of successful rappers, including Webbie, Boosie Badazz, and more recently, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who had a #1 album in 2019.

==North Louisiana music==
The region&#x27;s location, bordered by Texas on the west and the Mississippi Delta on the east has not led to the development of &quot;locally stylized&quot; music. Traditional and modern country music has been dominant, creating its own country stars, like Tim McGraw, Jimmie Davis, Tony Joe White, and Andy Griggs from Northeast Louisiana, and Trace Adkins, Kix Brooks, and Hank Williams Jr. from Northwest Louisiana. Tim McGraw has had 25 songs that have reached #1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, including &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; from 2004.

However, North Louisiana&#x27;s lasting contribution to the world of popular music was the radio program The &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, which started broadcasting in 1948 on KWKH in Shreveport. Hank Williams, George Jones, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and nearly every other country legend, or future country legend alive during the 1950s stepped on stage at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. They performed, many for the first time on radio, on a signal that covered much of the southeastern US. The original production of the show ended in 1960, but re-runs and the occasional special broadcast continued for a few years. The &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; was regarded as a stepping stone to The &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the legendary radio show from WSM in Nashville, Tennessee.

Northern Louisiana in the 1950s had a country rock scene, many of whose artists (the Lonesome Drifter) were recorded by local Ram Records. Later, Shreveport produced The Residents, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Sunday Mass Murder.

Shreveport native Danny Johnson a veteran of the industry gracing the stages and recordings of Rod Stewart, Rick Derringer, Alice Cooper, and Alcatrazz. (Eddie Van Halens) Private Life, Danny Johnson and the Bandits, and Axis. He has been the guitar slinger for the last 16 years for Steppenwolf.

Jeff Mangum, the founder of Neutral Milk Hotel and a founding member of The Elephant 6 Recording Company was born in Ruston, Louisiana.

==Recordings==
Small, local record labels proliferated from Houston, Texas to New Orleans, specializing in recording and distributing local acts. Labels such as &quot;Jin, Swallow, Maison de Soul,&quot; and &quot;Bayou&quot; continue to record and distribute Creole music, and other south Louisiana music. Many of the original versions of classic songs are still being made and distributed.

One of the most successful label owners was Floyd Soileau. Soileau started as a local DJ in Ville Platte, Louisiana in the mid-1950s, and soon decided he would rather help make music than play it. He started most of the labels listed in the previous paragraph. He and his record shop are important pieces of Louisiana&#x27;s music history.

<text>Esophageal cancer is cancer arising from the esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (&quot;glands&quot;) around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.

The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus).

Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux. In addition, for patients with achalasia, candidiasis (overgrow of the esophagus with the fungus candida) is the most important risk factor.

The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer&#x27;s stage and location, together with the person&#x27;s general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended.

As of 2018, esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer globally with 572,000 new cases during the year. It caused about 509,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China. It is around three times more common in men than in women. Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and other medical conditions, but generally tend to be fairly poor, as diagnosis is often late. Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%.

==Signs and symptoms==
Prominent symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer has infiltrated over 60% of the circumference of the esophageal tube, by which time the tumor is already in an advanced stage. Onset of symptoms is usually caused by narrowing of the tube due to the physical presence of the tumor.

The first and the most common symptom is usually difficulty in swallowing, which is often experienced first with solid foods and later with softer foods and liquids. Pain when swallowing is less usual at first. Weight loss is often an initial sign in cases of squamous-cell carcinoma, though not usually in cases of adenocarcinoma. Eventual weight loss due to reduced appetite and undernutrition is common. Pain behind the breastbone or in the region around the stomach often feels like heartburn. The pain can frequently be severe, worsening when food of any sort is swallowed. Another sign may be an unusually husky, raspy, or hoarse-sounding cough, a result of the tumor affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

The presence of the tumor may disrupt the normal contractions of the esophagus when swallowing. This can lead to nausea and vomiting, regurgitation of food and coughing. There is also an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to food entering the airways through the abnormal connections (fistulas) that may develop between the esophagus and the trachea (windpipe). Early signs of this serious complication may be coughing on drinking or eating. The tumor surface may be fragile and bleed, causing vomiting of blood. Compression of local structures occurs in advanced disease, leading to such problems as upper airway obstruction and superior vena cava syndrome. Hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) may occur.

If the cancer has spread elsewhere, symptoms related to metastatic disease may appear. Common sites of spread include nearby lymph nodes, the liver, lungs and bone. Liver metastasis can cause jaundice and abdominal swelling (ascites). Lung metastasis can cause, among other symptoms, impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), and dyspnea (the feelings often associated with impaired breathing).

==Causes==
The two main types (i.e. squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) have distinct sets of risk factors. Squamous-cell carcinoma is linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol. Adenocarcinoma has been linked to effects of long-term acid reflux. Tobacco is a risk factor for both types. Both types are more common in people over 60 years of age.

===Squamous-cell carcinoma===
The two major risk factors for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma are tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol. The combination of tobacco and alcohol has a strong synergistic effect. Some data suggest that about half of all cases are due to tobacco and about one-third to alcohol, while over three-quarters of the cases in men are due to the combination of smoking and heavy drinking. Risks associated with alcohol appear to be linked to its aldehyde metabolite and to mutations in certain related enzymes. Such metabolic variants are relatively common in Asia.

Other relevant risk factors include regular consumption of very hot drinks (over 65 °C or 149 °F) and ingestion of caustic substances. High levels of dietary exposure to nitrosamines (chemical compounds found both in tobacco smoke and certain foodstuffs) also appear to be a relevant risk factor. Unfavorable dietary patterns seem to involve exposure to nitrosamines through processed and barbecued meats, pickled vegetables, etc., and a low intake of fresh foods. Other associated factors include nutritional deficiencies, low socioeconomic status, and poor oral hygiene. Chewing betel nut (areca) is an important risk factor in Asia.

Physical trauma may increase the risk. This may include the drinking of very hot drinks.

===Adenocarcinoma===

Male predominance is particularly strong in esophageal adenocarcinoma, occurring about 7 to 10 times more frequently in men. This imbalance may be related to the characteristics and interactions of other known risk factors, including acid reflux and obesity.

==== Gastroesophageal reflux disease ====
The long-term erosive effects of acid reflux (an extremely common condition, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked to this type of cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, possibly due to hormonal factors. At a mechanistic level, in the esophagus there is a small HOXA13 expressing compartment that is more resistant to bile and acids as the normal squamous epithelium and that is prone to both intestinal differentiation as well as oncogenic transformation. Following GERD this HOXA13-expressing compartment outcompetes the normal squamous compartment, leading to the intestinal aspect of the esophagus and increased propensity to the development of esophageal cancer. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett&#x27;s esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. Bile reflux containing unconjugated bile acids, including deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, appears to contribute to esophageal adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis by inducing oxidative stress and DNA damage. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is unclear, and may in the past have been overestimated.

==== Obesity ====
Being obese or overweight is strongly associated with risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, and may in fact be the strongest of any type of obesity-related cancer, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Abdominal obesity seems to be of particular relevance, given the closeness of its association with this type of cancer, as well as with both GERD and Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. This type of obesity is characteristic of men. Physiologically, it stimulates GERD and also has other chronic inflammatory effects.

==== Helicobacter pylori ====
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection (a common occurrence thought to have affected over half of the world&#x27;s population) is not a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and actually appears to be protective. Despite being a cause of GERD and a risk factor for gastric cancer, the infection seems to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma of as much as 50%. The biological explanation for a protective effect is somewhat unclear. One explanation is that some strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot; reduce stomach acid, thereby reducing damage by GERD. Decreasing rates of &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection in Western populations over recent decades, which have been linked to less overcrowding in households, could be a factor in the concurrent increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma.

==== Other risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma ====
Female hormones may also have a protective effect, as EAC is not only much less common in women but develops later in life, by an average of 20 years. Although studies of many reproductive factors have not produced a clear picture, risk seems to decline for the mother in line with prolonged periods of breastfeeding.

Tobacco smoking increases risk, but the effect in esophageal adenocarcinoma is slight compared to that in squamous cell carcinoma, and alcohol has not been demonstrated to be a cause.

===Related conditions===
* Head and neck cancer is associated with second primary tumors in the region, including esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas, due to field cancerization (i.e. a regional reaction to long-term carcinogenic exposure).
* History of radiation therapy for other conditions in the chest is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.
* Corrosive injury to the esophagus by accidentally or intentionally swallowing caustic substances is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.
* Tylosis with esophageal cancer is a rare familial disease with autosomal dominant inheritance that has been linked to a mutation in the &quot;RHBDF2&quot; gene, present on chromosome 17: it involves thickening of the skin of the palms and soles and a high lifetime risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
* Achalasia (i.e. lack of the involuntary reflex in the esophagus after swallowing) appears to be a risk factor for both main types of esophageal cancer, at least in men, due to stagnation of trapped food and drink.
* Plummer–Vinson syndrome (a rare disease that involves esophageal webs) is also a risk factor.
* There is some evidence suggesting a possible causal association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. The relationship is unclear. Possible relevance of HPV could be greater in places that have a particularly high incidence of this form of the disease, as in some Asian countries, including China.
* There is an association between celiac disease and esophageal cancer. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis, probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancy. Moreover, in some cases the detection of celiac disease is due to the development of cancer, whose early symptoms are similar to some that may appear in celiac disease.

==Diagnosis==
===Clinical evaluation===
Although an occlusive tumor may be suspected on a barium swallow or barium meal, the diagnosis is best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a flexible tube with a light and camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy.

Additional testing is needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see , below). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can evaluate whether the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes). The sensitivity of a CT scan is limited by its ability to detect masses (e.g. enlarged lymph nodes or involved organs) generally larger than 1 cm. Positron emission tomography is also used to estimate the extent of the disease and is regarded as more precise than CT alone. PET/MR as a novel modality has shown promising results in preoperative staging with fair feasibility and good correlation in comparison to PET/CT. It can enhance tissue differentiation with lowering the radiation dose to the patient. Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound can provide staging information regarding the level of tumor invasion, and possible spread to regional lymph nodes.

The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 in long) is commonly divided into three parts for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur nearer the stomach and squamous cell carcinomas nearer the throat, but either may arise anywhere in the esophagus.

===Types===
Esophageal cancers are typically carcinomas that arise from the epithelium, or surface lining, of the esophagus. Most esophageal cancers fall into one of two classes: esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas (ESCC), which are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption—and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC), which are often associated with a history of GERD and Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. A rule of thumb is that a cancer in the upper two-thirds is likely to be ESCC and one in the lower one-third EAC.

Rare histologic types of esophageal cancer include different variants of squamous-cell carcinoma, and non-epithelial tumors, such as leiomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma, among others.

===Staging===
Staging is based on the TNM staging system, which classifies the amount of tumor invasion (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M). The currently preferred classification is the 2010 AJCC staging system for cancer of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. To help guide clinical decision making, this system also incorporates information on cell type (ESCC, EAC, etc.), grade (degree of differentiation – an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the cancer cells), and tumor location (upper, middle, lower, or junctional).

==Prevention==
Prevention includes stopping smoking or chewing tobacco. Overcoming addiction to areca chewing in Asia is another promising strategy for the prevention of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. The risk can also be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight. According to a 2022 umbrella review, calcium intake could be associated with lower risk.

According to the National Cancer Institute, &quot;diets high in cruciferous (cabbage, broccoli/broccolini, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts) and green and yellow vegetables and fruits are associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer.&quot; Dietary fiber is thought to be protective, especially against esophageal adenocarcinoma. There is no evidence that vitamin supplements change the risk.

===Screening===
People with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus (a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus) are at much higher risk, and may receive regular endoscopic screening for the early signs of cancer. Because the benefit of screening for adenocarcinoma in people without symptoms is unclear, it is not recommended in the United States. Some areas of the world with high rates of squamous-carcinoma have screening programs.

==Management==

Treatment is best managed by a multidisciplinary team covering the various specialties involved. Adequate nutrition must be assured, and appropriate dental care is essential. Factors that influence treatment decisions include the stage and cellular type of cancer (EAC, ESCC, and other types), along with the person&#x27;s general condition and any other diseases that are present.

In general, treatment with a curative intention is restricted to localized disease, without distant metastasis: in such cases a combined approach that includes surgery may be considered. Disease that is widespread, metastatic or recurrent is managed palliatively: in this case, chemotherapy may be used to lengthen survival, while treatments such as radiotherapy or stenting may be used to relieve symptoms and make it easier to swallow.

===Surgery===

If the cancer has been diagnosed while still in an early stage, surgical treatment with a curative intention may be possible. Some small tumors that only involve the mucosa or lining of the esophagus may be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Otherwise, curative surgery of early-stage lesions may entail removal of all or part of the esophagus (esophagectomy), although this is a difficult operation with a relatively high risk of mortality or post-operative difficulties. The benefits of surgery are less clear in early-stage ESCC than EAC. There are a number of surgical options, and the best choices for particular situations remain the subject of research and discussion.

The likely quality of life after treatment is a relevant factor when considering surgery. Surgical outcomes are likely better in large centers where the procedures are frequently performed. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, esophagectomy is nowadays not normally performed.

Esophagectomy is the removal of a segment of the esophagus; as this shortens the length of the remaining esophagus, some other segment of the digestive tract is pulled up through the chest cavity and interposed. This is usually the stomach or part of the large intestine (colon) or jejunum. Reconnection of the stomach to a shortened esophagus is called an esophagogastric anastomosis.

Esophagectomy can be performed using several methods. The choice of the surgical approach depends on the characteristics and location of the tumor, and the preference of the surgeon. Clear evidence from clinical trials for which approaches give the best outcomes in different circumstances is lacking. A first decision, regarding the point of entry, is between a transhiatial and a transthoracic procedure. The more recent transhiatial approach avoids the need to open the chest; instead the surgeon enters the body through an incision in the lower abdomen and another in the neck. The lower part of the esophagus is freed from the surrounding tissues and cut away as necessary. The stomach is then pushed through the esophageal hiatus (the hole where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm) and is joined to the remaining upper part of the esophagus at the neck.

The traditional transthoracic approach enters the body through the chest, and has a number of variations. The thoracoabdominal approach opens the abdominal and thoracic cavities together, the two-stage Ivor Lewis (also called Lewis–Tanner) approach involves an initial laparotomy and construction of a gastric tube, followed by a right thoracotomy to excise the tumor and create an esophagogastric anastomosis. The three-stage McKeown approach adds a third incision in the neck to complete the cervical anastomosis. Recent approaches by some surgeons use what is called extended esophagectomy, where more surrounding tissue, including lymph nodes, is removed &quot;en bloc&quot;.
If the person cannot swallow at all, an esophageal stent may be inserted to keep the esophagus open; stents may also assist in occluding fistulas. A nasogastric tube may be necessary to continue feeding while treatment for the tumor is given, and some patients require a gastrostomy (feeding hole in the skin that gives direct access to the stomach). The latter two are especially important if the patient tends to aspirate food or saliva into the airways, predisposing for aspiration pneumonia.

===Chemotherapy and radiotherapy===
Chemotherapy depends on the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or carboplatin or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine either continuously or every three weeks. In more studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other three drug regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. However, a meta-analysis in 2017 failed to demonstrate that anthracyclines such as epiribicin improved survival. Therefore in metastatic cancer, a two drug combination is now standard. Most recently with the addition of nivolumab or pembrolizumab immunotherapy where molecular markers suggest these may be helpful.

Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible.Cisplatin and fluorouracil were most commonly used a, however the REAL-2 trial confirmed that oxaliplatin and capecitabine were non-inferior and potentially more convenient.

Radiotherapy is given before, during, or after chemotherapy or surgery, and sometimes on its own to control symptoms. In patients with localised disease but contraindications to surgery, &quot;radical radiotherapy&quot; may be used with curative intent.

===Other approaches===
Forms of endoscopic therapy have been used for stage 0 and I disease: endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and mucosal ablation using radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation.

Laser therapy is the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while affecting only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.

===Follow-up===
Patients are followed closely after a treatment regimen has been completed. Frequently, other treatments are used to improve symptoms and maximize nutrition.

==Prognosis==
In general, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is quite poor, because most patients present with advanced disease. By the time the first symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing) appear, the disease has already progressed. The overall five-year survival rate (5YSR) in the United States is around 15%, with most people dying within the first year of diagnosis. The latest survival data for England and Wales (patients diagnosed during 2007) show that only one in ten people survives esophageal cancer for at least ten years.

Individualized prognosis depends largely on stage. Those with cancer restricted entirely to the esophageal mucosa have about an 80% 5YSR, but submucosal involvement brings this down to less than 50%. Extension into the muscularis propria (muscle layer of the esophagus) suggests a 20% 5YSR, and extension to the structures adjacent to the esophagus predict a 7% 5YSR. Patients with distant metastases (who are not candidates for curative surgery) have a less than 3% 5YSR.

==Epidemiology==

Esophageal cancer is the eighth-most frequently-diagnosed cancer worldwide, and because of its poor prognosis, it is the sixth most-common cause of cancer-related deaths. It caused about 400,000 deaths in 2012, accounting for about 5% of all cancer deaths (about 456,000 new cases were diagnosed, representing about 3% of all cancers).

ESCC (esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma) comprises 60–70% of all cases of esophageal cancer worldwide, while EAC (esophageal adenocarcinoma) accounts for a further 20–30% (melanomas, leiomyosarcomas, carcinoids and lymphomas are less common types). The incidence of the two main types of esophageal cancer varies greatly between different geographical areas. In general, ESCC is more common in the developing world, and EAC is more common in the developed world.

The worldwide incidence rate of ESCC in 2012 was 5.2 new cases per 100,000 person-years, with a male predominance (7.7 per 100,000 in men vs. 2.8 in women). It was the common type in 90% of the countries studied. ESCC is particularly frequent in the so-called &quot;Asian esophageal cancer belt&quot;, an area that passes through northern China, southern Russia, north-eastern Iran, northern Afghanistan and eastern Turkey. In 2012, about 80% of ESCC cases worldwide occurred in central and south-eastern Asia, and over half (53%) of all cases were in China. The countries with the highest estimated national incidence rates were (in Asia) Mongolia and Turkmenistan and (in Africa) Malawi, Kenya and Uganda. The problem of esophageal cancer has long been recognized in the eastern and southern parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, where ESCC appears to predominate.

In Western countries, EAC has become the dominant form of the disease, following an increase in incidence over recent decades (in contrast to the incidence of ESCC, which has remained largely stable). In 2012, the global incidence rate for EAC was 0.7 per 100,000 with a strong male predominance (1.1 per 100,000 in men vs. 0.3 in women). Areas with particularly high incidence rates include northern and western Europe, North America and Oceania. The countries with highest recorded rates were the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland and New Zealand.

===United States===
In the United States, esophageal cancer is the seventh-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute estimated that there were about 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer in 2013; the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new esophageal cancer cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths.

The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common among African American males with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted for the vast majority of esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in white American men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 2002. This increase was found in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics and became predominant in non-Hispanic whites. Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates for African Americans continue to be higher than the rate for Causasians. However, incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer has significantly decreased among African Americans since the early 1980s, whereas with whites it has continued to increase. Between 1975 and 2004, incidence of the adenocarcinoma type increased among white American males by over 460% and among white American females by 335%.
===United Kingdom===
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has risen considerably in the UK in recent decades. Overall, esophageal cancer is the thirteenth most common cancer in the UK (around 8,300 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the sixth most common cause of cancer death (around 7,700 people died in 2012).

==Research directions==
The risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma may be reduced in people using aspirin or related NSAIDs, but in the absence of randomized controlled trials the current evidence is inconclusive.

The genomics of esophageal adenocarcinoma is being studied using cancer genome sequencing. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is characterized by complex tumor genomes with heterogeneity within the tumor micro-environment.

<doc id="243541" wikidata="Q1026965" url="?curid=243541" title="List of -gate scandals and controversies">
<text>This is a list of scandals or controversies whose names include a &quot;-gate&quot; suffix, by analogy with the Watergate scandal, as well as other incidents to which the suffix has (often facetiously) been applied. This list also includes controversies that are widely referred to with a &quot;-gate&quot; suffix, but may be referred to by another more common name (such as the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, known as &quot;Bountygate&quot;). Use of the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix has spread beyond American English to many other countries and languages.

== Etymology, usage, and history of &quot;-gate&quot; ==

The suffix &quot;&quot; derives from the Watergate scandal in the United States in the early 1970s, which resulted in the resignation of US President Richard Nixon. The scandal was named after the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., where the burglary giving rise to the scandal took place; the complex itself was named after the &quot;Water Gate&quot; area where symphony orchestra concerts were staged on the Potomac River between 1935 and 1965.

The suffix has become productive as a libfix and is used to embellish a noun or name to suggest the existence of a far-reaching scandal, particularly in politics and government. As a CBC News column noted in 2001, the term may &quot;suggest unethical behaviour and a cover-up&quot;.

Such usage has been criticized by some commentators as clichéd and misleading. James Stanyer comments that &quot;revelations are given the &#x27;gate&#x27; suffix to add a thin veil of credibility, following &#x27;Watergate&#x27;, but most bear no resemblance to the painstaking investigation of that particular piece of presidential corruption&quot;. Stanyer links the widespread use of &quot;-gate&quot; to what the sociologist John Thompson calls &quot;scandal syndrome&quot;:


The adoption of &quot;-gate&quot; to suggest the existence of a scandal was promoted by William Safire, the conservative &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist and former Nixon administration speechwriter. As early as September 1974, he wrote of &quot;Vietgate&quot;, a proposed pardon of the Watergate criminals and Vietnam War draft dodgers. Subsequently, he coined numerous &quot;-gate&quot; terms, including Billygate, Briefingate, Contragate, Deavergate, Debategate, Doublebillingsgate (of which he later said &quot;My best [&quot;-gate&quot; coinage] was the encapsulation of a minor ... scandal as doublebillingsgate&quot;), Frankiegate, Franklingate, Genschergate, Housegate, Iraqgate, Koreagate, Lancegate, Maggiegate, Nannygate, Raidergate, Scalpgate, Travelgate, Troopergate, and Whitewatergate. The &quot;New York&quot; magazine suggested that his aim in doing so was &quot;rehabilitating Nixon by relentlessly tarring his successors with the same rhetorical brush – diminished guilt by association&quot;. Safire himself later said to author Eric Alterman that he &quot;may have been seeking to minimize the relative importance of the crimes committed by his former boss with this silliness&quot;.

The usage has spread into languages other than English; examples of &quot;-gate&quot; being used to refer to local political scandals have been reported from Argentina, Germany, South Korea, Hungary, Greece and the former Yugoslavia. The term is also used in Mandarin Chinese with the suffix &quot;-mén&quot; ().

Some commentators have characterized this use of the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix as a snowclone. But Geoffrey Pullum, the coiner of the term &quot;snowclone&quot;, considers that it is only a &quot;lexical word-formation analog&quot;. Martha Brockenbrough, the founder of The Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar, said that no one should aspire to write with cliches and that although they do help to get a lot of complicated things across in few words, they are not a good way to get people to keep reading what you&#x27;re writing.

===Similar phenomena===
The use of a suffix in this way is not new. &quot;-mandering&quot; has long been used as a suffix by a politician&#x27;s name in analogy with gerrymandering (&quot;Henry-mandering&quot; was used in 1852). In recent years, the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix as a catch-all signifier for scandal has seen some competition from as in &quot;Ballghazi&quot; instead of &quot;Deflategate&quot;, or &quot;Bridgeghazi&quot; instead of &quot;Bridgegate&quot;. The use of &quot;-ghazi&quot; is a play on the investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack, which, despite numerous official investigations into the possibility of government cover-ups, has resulted in no criminal charges or major repercussions for the individuals supposedly involved. &quot;-ghazi&quot; may be seen as carrying an ironic or self-effacing connotation in its usage, implying that the event described has the appearance and media coverage of a scandal, but does not actually amount to much in a grander sense.

Like the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix, the Italian &#x27; suffix emerged in Italian media from investigations in the 1990s that uncovered a system known as &#x27;. The term derives from &#x27;, which means &#x27;kickback&#x27; (e.g., bribery given for public works contracts), and &#x27;, meaning &#x27;city&#x27;. Examples of snowclone-like use of &#x27; include &#x27; (a financial scandal) and &quot;&quot; (a 2006 Italian football scandal).

<doc id="243545" wikidata="Q312782" url="?curid=243545" title="Bob Woodward">
<text>Robert Upshur Woodward (born March 26, 1943) is an American investigative journalist. He started working for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a reporter in 1971 and now holds the honorific title of associate editor though the Post no longer employs him.

While a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1972, Woodward teamed up with Carl Bernstein, and the two did much of the original news reporting on the Watergate scandal. These scandals led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. The work of Woodward and Bernstein was called &quot;maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time&quot; by longtime journalism figure Gene Roberts.

Woodward continued to work for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; after his reporting on Watergate. He has written 21 books on American politics and current affairs, 14 of which have topped best-seller lists.

==Early life, education and naval service==
Woodward was born in Geneva, Illinois, the son of Jane (née Upshur) and Alfred E. Woodward, a lawyer who later became chief judge of the 18th Judicial Circuit Court. He was raised in nearby Wheaton, Illinois, and educated at Wheaton Community High School (WCHS), a public high school in the same town. His parents divorced when he was twelve, and he and his brother and sister were raised by their father, who subsequently remarried.

Following graduation from WCHS in 1961, Woodward enrolled in Yale University with a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship and studied history and English literature. While at Yale, Woodward joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and was a member of Book and Snake. He received his B.A. degree in 1965.

After Yale, Woodward began a five-year tour of duty in the United States Navy. During his service in the Navy, Woodward served aboard the USS &quot;Wright&quot;, and was one of two officers assigned to move or handle nuclear launch codes the &quot;Wright&quot; carried in its capacity as a National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA). At one time, he was close to Admiral Robert O. Welander, being communications officer on the USS &quot;Fox&quot; under Welander&#x27;s command.

==Career==
After being discharged as a lieutenant in August 1970, Woodward was admitted to Harvard Law School but elected not to attend. Instead, he applied for a job as a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; while taking graduate courses in Shakespeare and international relations at George Washington University. Harry M. Rosenfeld, the &quot;Post&quot; metropolitan editor, gave him a two-week trial but did not hire him because of his lack of journalistic experience. After a year at the &quot;Montgomery Sentinel&quot;, a weekly newspaper in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Woodward was hired as a &quot;Post&quot; reporter in 1971.

===Watergate===

Woodward and Carl Bernstein were both assigned to report on the June 17, 1972, burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in a Washington, D.C., office building called Watergate. Their work, under editor Ben Bradlee, became known for being the first to report on a number of political &quot;dirty tricks&quot; used by the Nixon re-election committee during his campaign for re-election. Their book about the scandal, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, became a No. 1 bestseller and was later turned into a movie. The 1976 film, starring Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in investigative journalism.

The book and movie also led to the enduring mystery of the identity of Woodward&#x27;s secret Watergate informant known as Deep Throat, a reference to the title of a popular pornographic movie at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat&#x27;s identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For more than 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant&#x27;s identity until it was claimed by his family to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine to be former Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director W. Mark Felt in May 2005. Woodward immediately confirmed the veracity of this claim and subsequently published a book, titled &quot;The Secret Man&quot;, that detailed his relationship with Felt.

Woodward and Bernstein followed up &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; with a second book on Watergate, entitled &quot;The Final Days&quot; (Simon and Schuster 1976), covering in extensive depth the period from November 1973 until President Nixon resigned in August 1974.

The Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

=== &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot; scandal ===

In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the &quot;Post&quot; titled &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot; in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the &quot;Post&quot; doubted the story&#x27;s veracity, it was defended by the paper&#x27;s editors including Woodward, who was assistant managing editor. It was Woodward who submitted the story for Pulitzer Prize consideration, and Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned. In retrospect, Woodward made the following statement:
===1996 campaign finance controversy===
China&#x27;s alleged role in the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy first gained public attention when Woodward and Brian Duffy published a story stating that a United States Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.

===George W. Bush administration===
Woodward spent more time than any other journalist with former President George W. Bush, interviewing him six times for close to 11 hours total. Woodward&#x27;s four books, &quot;Bush at War&quot; (2002), &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; (2004), &quot;State of Denial&quot; (2006), and &quot;The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008)&quot; (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the September 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and Dan Balz described the events at Camp David in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the Worldwide Attack Matrix.

Woodward believed the Bush administration&#x27;s claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, he was asked by a telephone caller, &quot;Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no weapons of mass destruction&quot;, Woodward responded &quot;I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There&#x27;s just too much there.&quot; Woodward later admitted his error saying, &quot;I think I dropped the ball here. I should have pushed much, much harder on the skepticism about the reality of WMD; in other words, [I should have] said, &#x27;Hey, look, the evidence is not as strong as they were claiming.

In 2008, as a part of the Talks at Google series, Woodward, who was interviewed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said that he had a fourth book in his &quot;Bush at War&quot; series in the making. He then added jokingly that his wife had told him that she would kill him if he decides to write a fifth in the series.

====Involvement in the Plame scandal====

On November 14, 2005, Woodward gave a two-hour deposition to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that Iraq war critic Joe Wilson&#x27;s wife (later identified as Valerie Plame), worked for the CIA as a WMD analyst, not as an undercover operative. Woodward appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on November 16, 2005, and was the first time Woodward revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Woodward testified the information was given to him in a &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;offhand&quot; manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to &quot;out&quot; Plame as a CIA employee. Later, Woodward&#x27;s source identified himself. It was Richard Armitage, Colin Powell&#x27;s deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle.

Woodward said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book &quot;Plan of Attack&quot;. He did not reveal the official&#x27;s disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source.

In his deposition, Woodward also said that he had conversations with Scooter Libby after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about Joe Wilson&#x27;s wife before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known.

Woodward apologized to Leonard Downie Jr., editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting.

New York University professor Jay Rosen severely criticized Woodward for allegedly being co-opted by the Bush White House and also for not telling the truth about his role in the Plame affair, writing: &quot;Not only is Woodward not in the hunt, but he is slowly turning into the hunted. Part of what remains to be uncovered is how Woodward was played by the Bush team, and what they thought they were doing by leaking to him, as well as what he did with the dubious information he got.&quot;

===Other professional activities===
Although Woodward is no longer employed by the &quot;Post,&quot; Woodward has continued to write books and report stories for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and has the title of associate editor at the paper, which was described by &quot;Post&quot; media columnist Margaret Sullivan as honorific with no regular responsibilities. He focuses on the presidency, intelligence, and Washington institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court, The Pentagon, and the Federal Reserve. He also wrote the book &quot;Wired&quot;, about the Hollywood drug culture and the death of comic John Belushi.

In 2018, Woodward announced participation in an online class on investigative journalism.

===Sequester dispute with Obama administration===
On February 22, 2013, shortly before the United States federal budget sequester took effect, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a column by Woodward in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the sequester had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Woodward said his research showed that the sequester proposal had originated with the White House. Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed, &quot;The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.&quot;

On February 27, Woodward told &quot;Politico&quot; that before the column was published, Woodward had called a senior White House official, later identified by reporters as economic adviser Gene Sperling, to discuss the piece, and that the official had &quot;yelled at [Woodward] for about a half-hour&quot; before sending him a page-long email that included the sentence, &quot;I think you will regret staking out that claim.&quot; In &quot;Politico&quot; reporting, Woodward&#x27;s focus on that line was described as &quot;making clear he saw [that sentence] as a veiled threat&quot;, although Woodward did not use the word &quot;threat&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;. Several other sources also indicated that Woodward had expressed the line as an intended threat.

The next day, &quot;Politico&quot; published the complete email exchange between Woodward and Sperling. Sperling&#x27;s statements leading up to the &quot;regret&quot; line read: &quot;But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.&quot; The White House subsequently released a statement that &quot;of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more.&quot; Upon release of the emails, several conservative commentators indicated they no longer agreed with characterizing the &quot;regret&quot; statement as a threat.

In a February 28 Fox News Channel interview, Woodward said he had never used the word &quot;threat&quot; but said Sperling&#x27;s conduct was &quot;not the way to operate in a White House&quot;. He also said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been flooded with emails from people in the press saying this is exactly the way the White House works, they are trying to control and they don&#x27;t want to be challenged or crossed&quot;. &quot;National Journal&quot; editor Ron Fournier, conservative &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Jennifer Rubin, and Fox News contributor and former Clinton adviser Lanny Davis expressed support for Woodward; Fournier and Davis described similar experiences with Obama administration officials.

===Biden allegations===
In January 2025, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that in James Comer&#x27;s upcoming book, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Money&quot;, Comer alleges that Woodward confided to him at a private dinner in February 2023 &quot;that everyone in DC knew that Joe allowed his family to sell access to him, but as far as he was aware, that was not illegal.&quot; Woodward has denied the allegation.

==Career recognition and awards==
Although not a recipient in his own right, Woodward made contributions to two Pulitzer Prizes won by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. First, he and Bernstein were the lead reporters on Watergate and the &quot;Post&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. He was also the main reporter for the &quot;Post&quot;″s coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The &quot;Post&quot; won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for 10 of its stories on the subject.
Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award, including the Heywood Broun award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), Sigma Delta Chi Award (1973), George Polk Award (1972), William Allen White Medal (2000), and the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). In 2012, Colby College presented Woodward with the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate.

Woodward has authored or co-authored 21 nonfiction books in the past 40 years. All of them have been national bestsellers and 14 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author.

In his 1995 memoir, &quot;A Good Life,&quot; former &quot;Post&quot; Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Woodward in the foreword. &quot;It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodward—surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I&#x27;ve ever seen... And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism&#x27;s ladder ever since Watergate.&quot; In 1995, Woodward also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

David Gergen, who had worked in the White House during the Richard Nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, &quot;Eyewitness to Power&quot;, of Woodward&#x27;s reporting, &quot;I don&#x27;t accept everything he writes as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest.&quot;

In 2001, Woodward won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.

Fred Barnes of the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; called Woodward &quot;the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever.&quot; In 2003, Al Hunt of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called Woodward &quot;the most celebrated journalist of our age.&quot; In 2004, Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, &quot;Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time.&quot;

In 2014, Robert Gates former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, said that he wished he&#x27;d recruited Woodward into the CIA, saying, &quot;He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill [their] guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn&#x27;t be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.&quot;

== Style and reception == 
Woodward often uses unnamed sources in his reporting for the &quot;Post&quot; and in his books. Using extensive interviews with firsthand witnesses, documents, meeting notes, diaries, calendars, and other documentation, Woodward attempts to construct a seamless narrative of events, most often told through the eyes of the key participants.

Nicholas von Hoffman has made the criticism that &quot;arrestingly irrelevant detail is [often] used&quot;, while Michael Massing believes Woodward&#x27;s books are &quot;filled with long, at times tedious passages with no evident direction.&quot;

Joan Didion published a comprehensive criticism of Woodward in a lengthy September 1996 essay in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Though &quot;Woodward is a widely trusted reporter, even an American icon&quot;, she says that he assembles reams of often irrelevant detail, fails to draw conclusions, and make judgments. &quot;Measurable cerebral activity is virtually absent&quot; from his books after Watergate from 1979 to 1996, she said. She said the books are notable for &quot;a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured.&quot; She ridicules &quot;fairness&quot; as &quot;a familiar newsroom piety, the excuse in practice for a good deal of autopilot reporting and lazy thinking.&quot; All this focus on what people said and thought—their &quot;decent intentions&quot;—circumscribes &quot;possible discussion or speculation&quot;, resulting in what she called &quot;political pornography&quot;.

The &quot;Post&quot; Richard Harwood defended Woodward in a September 6, 1996, column, arguing that Woodward&#x27;s method is that of a reporter—&quot;talking to people you write about, checking and cross-checking their versions of contemporary history,&quot; and collecting documentary evidence in notes, letters, and records.&quot;
*Woodward has been accused of exaggeration and fabrication regarding Deep Throat. After Mark Felt was announced as the true identity behind Deep Throat in 2005, John Dean and Ed Gray, in separate publications, used Woodward&#x27;s book &quot;All The President&#x27;s Men&quot; and his published notes on his meetings with Deep Throat to argue that Deep Throat could not have been only Mark Felt. They argued that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only one of whom was Felt. Gray, in his book &quot;In Nixon&#x27;s Web&quot;, even went so far as to publish an e-mail and telephone exchange he had with Donald Santarelli, a Washington lawyer who was a Justice Department official during Watergate, in which Santarelli confirmed to Gray that he was the source behind statements Woodward recorded in notes he has attributed to Deep Throat. However, Stephen Mielke, an archivist at the University of Texas who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein papers, said it is likely the page was misfiled under Felt because no source was identified. The original page of notes is in the Mark Felt file but &quot;the carbon is located with the handwritten and typed notes attributed to Santarelli.&quot; Ed Gray said that Santarelli confirmed to him that he was the source behind the statements in the notes.
*J. Bradford DeLong has noted considerable inconsistencies between the accounts of the making of Clinton economic policy described in Woodward&#x27;s book &quot;Maestro&quot; and his book &quot;The Agenda&quot;.
*Some of Woodward&#x27;s critics accuse him of abandoning critical inquiry to maintain his access to high-profile political actors. Anthony Lewis called the style &quot;a trade in which the great grant access in return for glory.&quot; Christopher Hitchens accused Woodward of acting as &quot;stenographer to the rich and powerful.&quot;
*Writer Tanner Colby, who co-wrote a biography of John Belushi with the late actor&#x27;s widow Judy, wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; that, while Woodward&#x27;s frequently criticized 1984 book &quot;Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi&quot; is largely accurate in its description of events, Woodward either gets the context wrong or does not find any context at all. For example, Belushi&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s funeral, which led him to make a serious effort to sober up, gets merely a paragraph in Woodward&#x27;s retelling, while a 24-hour drug binge in Los Angeles goes on for eight pages simply because the limo driver was willing to talk to Woodward. &quot;It&#x27;s like someone wrote a biography of Michael Jordan in which all the stats and scores are correct, but you come away with the impression that Michael Jordan wasn&#x27;t very good at playing basketball,&quot; he concluded. Because it was unique among Woodward&#x27;s books in that it made no use of confidential or anonymous sources, Colby was able to interview many of the same sources that Woodward had used, making comparisons of their recollection of events to Woodward&#x27;s accounting of them relatively easy.
*Woodward believed the Bush administration&#x27;s claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the war, and the publication of the book &quot;At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA&quot; by former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet led Woodward to write an account of the extent of his pre-war conversations with Tenet in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in which he also chastised &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd for being critical of him.
*Woodward was also accused of fabricating a deathbed interview with CIA Director William Casey, as described in &quot;Veil&quot;, where Casey supposedly admitted to his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair. Casey&#x27;s widow and several individuals from the agency stated that Casey was incapable of speaking at the time of the alleged interview. However, Robert M. Gates, Casey&#x27;s deputy at the time, in his book &quot;From the Shadows&quot;, recounts speaking with Casey during this exact period. Gates directly quotes Casey saying 22 words, even more than the 19 words Woodward said Casey used with him. The CIA&#x27;s internal report found that Casey &quot;had forty-three meetings or phone calls with Woodward, including a number of meetings at Casey&#x27;s home with no one else present&quot; during the period Woodward was researching his book. Gates was also quoted saying, &quot;When I saw him in the hospital, his speech was even more slurred than usual, but if you knew him well, you could make out a few words, enough to get sense of what he was saying.&quot; Following Casey&#x27;s death, President Ronald Reagan wrote: &quot;[Woodward]&#x27;s a liar and he lied about what Casey is supposed to have thought of me.&quot;
*Woodward has also been widely criticized for having withheld interviews with President Donald Trump in which Trump revealed that COVID-19 was a much greater threat than he had publicly claimed. These interviews were conducted in February 2020, but were not released until September 2020 during the promotion of &quot;Rage,&quot; Woodward&#x27;s book about the Trump presidency.

Commentator David Frum has said that Washington officials can learn something about the way Washington works from Woodward&#x27;s books: &quot;From his books, you can draw a composite profile of the powerful Washington player. That person is highly circumspect, highly risk averse, eschews new ideas, flatters his colleagues to their face (while trashing them to Woodward behind their backs), and is always careful to avoid career-threatening confrontation. We all admire heroes, but Woodward&#x27;s books teach us that those who rise to leadership are precisely those who take care to abjure heroism for themselves.&quot;

==Lecture circuit==
As of 2008, Woodward was giving speeches on the &quot;lecture circuit&quot; to industry lobbying groups, such as the American Bankruptcy Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Mortgage Bankers Association. Woodward was commanding speaking fees &quot;rang[ing] from $15,000 to $60,000&quot; and donating them to his personal foundation, the Woodward Walsh Foundation, which donated to charities including Sidwell Friends School. &quot;Washington Post&quot; policy prohibits &quot;speaking engagements without permission from department heads&quot; but Woodward insisted that the policy is &quot;fuzzy and ambiguous&quot;.

Woodward also lectures at colleges and universities. He gave the 2001 Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University, and has spoken at the University of Arkansas, University of Alabama, Eastern Connecticut State University, West Texas A&amp;M University, and Oklahoma City Community College. Following the publication in 2018 of &quot;Fear: Trump in the White House&quot;, he spoke to an overflow crowd of students, faculty, and guests at Virginia Commonwealth University. His May 4, 2019 speech at Kent State University contained the startling revelation of previously unreleased audiotape on which then-president Richard Nixon can be heard lauding the 1970 shooting of four students for its effect on those who disagreed with him.

==Personal life==
Woodward has been married three times. His first marriage (1966–1969) was to his high school sweetheart Kathleen Middlekauff, now an English professor. His second marriage (1974–1979) was to Frances Kuper. In 1989, he married for a third time to Elsa Walsh (b. August 25, 1957), a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the author of &quot;Divided Lives: The Public and Private Struggles of Three American Women&quot;.

His oldest daughter, Tali, is also a journalist. She directed a graduate program in journalism at Columbia University for six years before becoming an editor for &quot;The Trace&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Woodward was portrayed by Robert Redford in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), J. T. Walsh in &quot;Wired&quot; (1989), Will Ferrell in &quot;Dick&quot; (1999), Julian Morris in &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot; (2017), and Spencer Garrett in &quot;The Front Runner&quot; (2018). Redford&#x27;s voice from &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, depicting Woodward&#x27;s telephone call to Howard Hunt, was reused in episode 4 of the 2023 HBO miniseries, &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, in depicting the call from Hunt&#x27;s perspective.

<text>Pope John IV (; died 12 October 642) was the bishop of Rome from 24 December 640 to his death. His election followed a four-month vacancy. He wrote to the clergy of Ireland and Scotland to tell them of the mistakes they were making with regard to the time of keeping Easter and condemned Monothelitism as heresy.
According to sacred tradition, he created the Catholic Church in Croatia with Abbot Martin.

==Rise==
Pope John was a native of Iadera, Dalmatia. He was the son of the &quot;scholasticus&quot; (advocate) Venantius Fortunatus. At the time of his election, he was archdeacon of the Roman Church, an important role in governing the see. John was considered &quot;a very cultured man&quot;. As John&#x27;s consecration on 24 December 640 followed very soon after his election, it is supposed that the elections were being confirmed by the exarch of Ravenna rather than directly by the emperor in Constantinople.

==Papacy==
While still only pope-elect, John, with the other bishops of the Catholic Church, wrote to the clergy of Ireland and Scotland to tell them of the mistakes they were making with regard to the time of keeping Easter, and exhort them to be on their guard against the Pelagian heresy. At about the same time, he condemned Monothelism as heresy. Emperor Heraclius immediately disowned the Monothelite document known as the &quot;Ecthesis&quot;. To Heraclius&#x27; son, Constantine III, John addressed his apology to Pope Honorius I, in which he deprecated the attempt to connect the name of Honorius with Monothelism. Honorius, he declared, in speaking of one will in Jesus, only meant to assert that there were not two contrary wills in Him.

Troubles in his native land caused by the invasions of Slavs directed John&#x27;s attention there. To alleviate the distress of the inhabitants, John sent the abbot Martin into Dalmatia and Istria with large sums of money for the redemption of captives. As the ruined churches could not be rebuilt, the relics of some of the more important Dalmatian saints were brought to Rome. John then erected an oratory in their honour. It was adorned by the pope with mosaics depicting John himself holding a model of his oratory in his hands. John endeavoured thereby to convert the Slavs in Dalmatia and Istria to Christianity. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus claimed that Duke Porga of Croatia, archon of White Croats who have been invited into Dalmatia by Heraclius, sent to Emperor Heraclius for Christian teachers. It is supposed that the emperor to whom this message was sent was Emperor Heraclius himself, and that he sent it to Pope John IV.

John was buried in the Basilica of St. Peter.

<text>The State Anthem of Turkmenistan was adopted as the national anthem of Turkmenistan in 1996, replacing the Anthem of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. After the death of Saparmurat Nyýazow in 2006, the lyrics were modified in 2008 by removing his title of &quot;Türkmenbaşy&quot; in the refrain. The music was composed by Weli Muhadow, who also composed the music for the Soviet-era anthem.

The lyrics were originally written by the first president of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Nyýazow (better known as Türkmenbaşy), who died on 21 December 2006. Less than two years after his death, references to him in the chorus were replaced with &quot;the people&quot;, and both the third and final verse and the chorus at the start of the piece were removed. The national anthem is played at the start of radio and television broadcasts at 6:55 a.m. local time and played again when radio and television stations sign off.

==History==
Until 1996, Turkmenistan, which received independence a few years earlier, used the Turkmen SSR anthem without words as the state anthem. The new anthem was adopted on 27 September 1996 by the People&#x27;s Council of Turkmenistan in Bayramali. The anthem, known by the first sentence of the chorus, &quot;The great creation of Turkmenbashi&quot;, in reference to the country&#x27;s first leader Saparmurat Nyýazow, was used from 1997 to 2008, when it was given minor changes when his successor, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, ordered to do so following Nyýazow&#x27;s death in 2006.

<text>The Xoloitzcuintle (or Xoloitzquintle, Xoloitzcuintli, or Xolo) is one of several breeds of hairless dog. It is found in standard, intermediate, and miniature sizes. The Xolo also comes in a coated variety, totally covered in fur. Coated and hairless can be born in the same litter as a result of the same combination of genes. The hairless variant is known as the Perro pelón mexicano or Mexican hairless dog. It is characterized by its wrinkles and dental abnormalities. In Nahuatl, from which its name originates, it is &quot;xōlōitzcuintli&quot; (singular) and &quot;xōlōitzcuintin&quot; (plural). The name comes from the god &quot;Xolotl&quot; that, according to ancient narratives, is its creator and &quot;itzcuīntli&quot; , meaning &#x27;dog&#x27; in the Nahuatl language.

==History==


Ceramic sculptures of a hairless breed of dog have been found in burial sites in ancient West Mexico. In ancient times, Xolos were often sacrificed and then buried with their owners to act as guides to the soul on its journey to the underworld. They have been found in burial sites of both the Maya and the Toltec.

Sixteenth-century Spanish accounts tell of large numbers of dogs being served at banquets. Aztec merchant feasts could have 80–100 turkeys and 20–40 dogs served as food. When these two meats were served in the same dish, the dog meat was at the bottom of the dish, possibly because it was held in lower regard.

The Aztecs consumed few domesticated animals, with over 90% of the bones found at archeological sites being deer.

===Genetics===
A 1999 genetic study using mitochondrial DNA found that the DNA sequences of the Xoloitzcuintle were identical to those of dogs from the Old World. In 2018, an analysis of DNA from the entire genome indicated that domesticated dogs entered North America from Siberia for 4,500 years and were isolated for the next 9,000 years. After contact with Europeans, these dogs were replaced by Eurasian dogs and their local descendants. The pre-contact dogs exhibited a unique genetic signature that is now almost gone due to their assimilation into the Eurasian dog gene pool. In 2020, the sequencing of ancient dog genome indicates that in two Mexican breeds the Chihuahua and Xoloitzcuintli derive 4% and 3% of their ancestry from pre-colonial dogs, almost entirely being descended from Eurasian dogs.

Their phenotype is a consequence of canine ectodermal dysplasia caused by a mutation on the FOXI3 autosomal gene.

==Registry==
===Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI)===

The breed did not receive any official notice in its homeland until the 1950s. The FCI, founded in 1940, was not prepared to declare the Xolo an official purebred at that time. According to breed historian Norman Pelham Wright, author of &quot;The Enigma of the Xoloitzcuintli&quot;, Xolos began to turn up at Mexican dog shows in the late 1940s. Although they were recognized as indigenous specimens of a native breed, interest in them was minimal at that time, because information was scarce and no standard existed by which to judge them. Within a decade, the FCI realized that the breed would become extinct if drastic action were not taken to save it. This led to the widely publicized Xolo Expedition of 1954. With the official sanction of the FCI, Wright and a team of Mexican and British dog authorities set off to discover if any purebred Xolos still existed in remote areas of Mexico. Eventually 10 structurally strong Xolos were found and these dogs formed the foundation of Mexico&#x27;s program to revive the breed. A committee headed by Wright authored the first official standard for the breed; on May 1, 1956, the Xolo was finally recognized in its native land and, as Mexico is a member of the FCI, worldwide.

===American Kennel Club (AKC)===
Xolos were among the first breeds recorded by the American Kennel Club (AKC). A Mexican dog named &quot;Mee Too&quot; made breed history as the first AKC-registered Xolo in 1887. &quot;Chinito Junior&quot;, bred and owned by Valetska Radtke of New York City, became the breed&#x27;s only AKC champion to date. He earned his title on October 19, 1940.

In 1959, the Xolo was dropped from the AKC stud book due to the breed&#x27;s scarcity and perceived extinction. The Xoloitzcuintli Club of America (XCA), the official parent club for the breed, was founded on October 26, 1986, to regain AKC recognition for the breed. On May 13, 2008, AKC voted to readmit the breed to its Miscellaneous Class starting January 1, 2009. The founding members voted unanimously to recognize all three sizes (toy, miniature and standard) and both varieties (hairless and coated) at their initial meeting. Since then, the XCA has compiled a stud book modeled on requirements for eventual AKC acceptance, held an annual independent specialty show, published a quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Xolo News&quot;, and maintained an active national rescue network, National Xolo Rescue (known before 2009 as The Xolo Rescue League). Since January 1, 2007, FSS registered Xolos have been eligible to compete in AKC performance events. The breed was moved into the AKC Studbook in December 2010 and has been eligible to be shown in the AKC Non-Sporting group since January 1, 2011.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
The breed ranges in size from about 10 to 55 lb (5 to 23 kg). The height is 9 to 26 inches (23–67 cm). Similar in appearance to a Pharaoh Hound, with a sleek body, almond-shaped eyes, large bat-like ears, and a long neck, the Xolo is notable for its dominant trait of hairlessness. The dominant hairless trait originated in this breed as a spontaneous mutation thousands of years ago. The recessive expression of the trait will produce a coated variety, which is genetically inseparable from the hairless, as the homozygous appearance of the hairless mutation is fatal to the unborn pup. Most litters contain both hairless and coated puppies. The coated variety, covered with a short, flat dense coat represents the original form of the dog, prior to the occurrence of the spontaneous hairless mutation. The hairless variety is completely hairless on the body, with many dogs exhibiting a few short hairs on the top of the head, the toes, and the tip of the tail. Most hairless dogs are black or bluish-gray in color.
The allele responsible for the Xolo&#x27;s hairlessness also affects the dog&#x27;s dentition: Hairless Xolos typically have an incomplete set of teeth while the dogs of the coated variety have complete dentition.

The Xolo is moderate in all aspects of its appearance, conveying an impression of strength, agility, and elegance. Xolo body proportions are rectangular, slightly longer in total body length than the height measured at the highest point of the withers (top of the shoulders). The breed occurs naturally in two varieties, hairless and coated. Hairless Xolos result from the presence of the dominant allele (HH or Hh) at the FOXI3 locus. Coated Xolo are the recessive expression, occurring only when two coated alleles (hh) are present. Breeding coated to coated will only produce coated pups because only the coated allele is present to be passed on.

Both varieties occur in all hair or skin colors, and the skin is often marked, splashed, or spotted. The most common colors are various shades termed black, grey, bronze, yellowish-blonde, blue and red. The breed occurs in a range of sizes, which breeders have standardized into three designations: Standard, Miniature and Toy.

The Xoloitzcuintle has a calm and attentive temperament.

===Health===
The Xolo has been developed by natural selection for thousands of years, and is therefore generally not prone to health and structure problems as other dog breeds more modified by human selection efforts. Xolos came from tropical climates and are not suited for outdoor life in colder temperate and northern climates; they should be considered an indoor dog breed. They need bathing, light grooming and skin care as with other dogs of similar physical type, or acne can result. Most skin problems arise from poor breeding, neglect, or over-bathing and over-lotioning, stripping natural protections and clogging pores.

== In contemporary culture ==
Xoloitzcuintles are represented in popular culture and are popular pets. Museo El Carmen in Mexico City exhibited a show titled &quot;Xolos, compañeros de viaje&quot; (Xolos, travel companions) in 2019–20 of more than 100 artifacts – ceramics, remains, and artworks – overviewing the importance of the Xoloitzcuintle in Mexican heritage. A Xolo named Dante stars in the US blockbuster CGI animation 2017 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Coco&quot;. On August 12, 2016, the Mayor of Mexico City Miguel Ángel Mancera designated the Xoloitzcuintle a &quot;cultural heritage and symbol&quot; of Mexico City. The Dolores Olmedo Museum keeps a pack of Xolos on their grounds.

The Xoloitzcuintle is the symbol and mascot of Club Tijuana, the Xoloitzcuintles de Caliente, a professional soccer club founded in 2007. Xolos are depicted in some of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo&#x27;s paintings, one of which is commemorated on the 2007 500-peso note, featuring Frida Kahlo&#x27;s painting titled The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl (1949) on the reverse of the note. Diego Rivera&#x27;s large murals, &quot;The History of Mexico&quot;, in the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City feature numerous Xolos.

<doc id="243550" wikidata="Q199533" url="?curid=243550" title="Pope John V">
<text>Pope John V (; died 2 August 686) was the bishop of Rome from 23 July 685 to his death on 2 August 686. He was the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy consecrated without prior imperial consent, and the first in a line of ten consecutive popes of Eastern origin. His papacy was marked by reconciliation between the city of Rome and the Empire.

== Early life ==

John was born in Antioch and was of Syrian origin. He was named papal legate to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680.

== Papacy ==

John V was the first Pope of the Byzantine Papacy consecrated without the direct imperial approval. Emperor Constantine IV had done away with the requirement during the pontificate of Benedict II, John V&#x27;s predecessor, providing that &quot;the one elected to the Apostolic See may be ordained pontiff from that moment and without delay&quot;. In a return to the &quot;ancient practice&quot;, John V was elected in July 685 &quot;by the general population&quot; of Rome. Constantine IV doubtlessly trusted that the population and clergy of Rome had been sufficiently Easternized, and indeed the next ten pontiffs were of Eastern descent.

John V&#x27;s papacy saw a continuation of improving relations with Byzantium. The Emperor greatly reduced taxes on the papal patrimonies of Sicily and Calabria and abolished other taxes, such as a surtax on grain that had been paid only with difficulty in recent years. A letter from Justinian II assured John V that a &quot;synod of high-ranking civil and ecclesiastical officials&quot;, including the &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; and the Byzantine military, had read and thereafter sealed the text of the Third Council of Constantinople, to prevent any alteration to its canons. The letter was addressed to &quot;John pope of the city of Rome&quot;, written while the Emperor believed the pope to still be alive, but received by Pope Conon.

Like his immediate predecessors, John V was unusually generous towards the diaconies of Rome, distributing 1,900 &quot;solidi&quot; to &quot;all the clergy, the monastic diaconies, and the &quot;mansionarii&quot;&quot; for the poor.

== Death ==

After a pontificate of little more than a year, John V died in his bed in August 686, giving rise to a &quot;heated debate over his successor&quot;. The clergy favored an archpriest named Peter, while the army supported another priest, Theodore. The faction of the clergy gathered outside the Constantinian basilica and the faction of the military met in the Church of St. Stephen. Shuttle diplomacy proved futile and eventually the clergy elected Conon, a Greco-Sicilian.

John V was buried among the papal tombs in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. His inscription praised him for combating Monothelitism at the Third Council of Constantinople &quot;with the titles of the faith, keeping such vigilance, you united the minds so that the inimical wolf mixing in might not seize the sheep, or the more powerful crush those below&quot;. John V&#x27;s tomb was destroyed during the Arab raid against Rome in 846.

<text>David McKean (born 29 December 1963) is an English artist. His work incorporates drawing, painting, photography, collage, found objects, digital art, and sculpture. McKean has illustrated works by authors such as S.F. Said, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison, Heston Blumenthal, Ray Bradbury and Stephen King. He has also directed three feature films.

== Career ==

=== Comics ===
McKean first showed his work to editors at Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Continuity Comics when visiting New York City in 1986. There, he met Neil Gaiman and the pair collaborated on the graphic novel &quot;Violent Cases&quot;, which was published in 1987. This was followed in 1988 by a &quot;Black Orchid&quot; miniseries and &quot;Hellblazer&quot; covers for DC Comics.

In 1989, McKean illustrated the Batman graphic novel, &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, with writer Grant Morrison. The book was a commercial success, selling over 260,000 copies in hardcover and paperback. From 1989 to 1997, McKean created the covers for Gaiman&#x27;s series &quot;The Sandman&quot; and many of its spin-offs. In 1998, the cover images from &quot;The Sandman&quot; were released in one volume titled &quot;Dustcovers: The Collected Sandman Covers&quot;. Further collaborations with Gaiman produced the graphic novels &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; and &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch&quot;. In 1995 McKean wrote and illustrated a book for The Rolling Stones called &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; to tie in with the release of their album of the same name.

Between 1990 and 1996, McKean wrote and drew the ten issues of &quot;Cages&quot;, a graphic novel about artists and creativity.

McKean&#x27;s collections of short comics &quot;Pictures That Tick&quot;, and &quot;Pictures That Tick 2: Exhibition&quot; were published by Dark Horse Comics in 2009 and 2015. &quot;Pictures That Tick&quot; won the Victoria and Albert Museum Illustrated Book of the Year award.

McKean created a wordless erotic graphic novel called &quot;Celluloi&quot;d for Delcourt, which was published in the United States by Fantagraphics Books.

&quot;Black Dog: The Dreams of Paul Nash&quot;, which was commissioned by the 14-18 Now Foundation, The Imperial War Museum and The Lakes International Comic art Festival, was published in October 2016 by Dark Horse Comics as an oversized hardback and regular paperback.

&quot;Raptor&quot; was released in 2021 by Dark Horse Books and is the first of a proposed series of books featuring the character Sokol.

<text>The ecoSCOPE is an optical sensor system, deployed from a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or fibre optic cable, to investigate behavior and microdistribution of small organisms in the ocean.

==Deployment==
Although an ROV may be very small and quiet, it is impossible to approach feeding herring closer than 40 cm. The ecoSCOPE allows observation of feeding herring from a distance of only 4 cm. From 40 cm, the herrings&#x27; prey (copepods) in front of the herring are invisible due to the deflection of light by phytoplankton and microparticles in highly productive waters where herring live. With the ecoSCOPE, the predators are illuminated by natural light, the prey by a light sheet, projected via a second endoscope from strobed LEDs (2 ms, 100% relative intensity at 700 nm, 53% at 690 nm, 22% at 680 nm, 4% at 660 nm, 0% at 642 nm).

By imitating the long, thin snout of the garfish protruding into the security sphere of the alert herrings, an endoscope with a tip diameter of 11 mm is used. The endoscope is camouflaged to reduce the brightness-contrast against the background: the top is black and the sides are silvery. Additionally, the front of the ROV is covered by a mirror, reflecting a light gradient resembling the natural scene and making the instrument body virtually invisible to the animals. A second sensor images other copepods, phytoplankton and particles at very high magnification. Another advantage of these small &quot;optical probes&quot; is the minimal disruption of the current-field in the measuring volume, allowing for less disturbed surveys of microturbulence and shear.

Another video can be seen in the article for Atlantic herring.

An ecoSCOPE was also deployed to measure the dynamics of particles in a polluted estuary: see image on Particle (ecology), another as an underwater environmental monitoring system, utilizing the orientation capacity of juvenile glasseel.

==Specifications==
The ecoSCOPE is a product of the new initiative of &quot;Ocean Online Biosensors&quot;: a synthesis of IT-sensoric and the sensing capability of ocean organisms.
Depicted in the image on the right is the central unit. On all four corners are small entrances, through which water from different sources enters (in this case, rivers and creeks in New Jersey). It flows through a small labyrinth and mixes in the central chamber. It exits through a small tube in the middle. The glasseels migrate through this small tube heading into the current. In the middle is the entrance for the eels. They test the different water qualities and migrate toward the corner, where they exit.

It is the opinion of many scientists that eels have developed the finest nose on the planet. They can sense concentrations of one part in 19 trillion. This is the same concentration as one glass of alcohol in the waters of all America&#x27;s Great Lakes. For the eels the sensory impressions are probably as diverse as the colors visible for us.

The system is submerged, and a digital camera observes the exits. The dynIMAGE software monitors the frequency of decisions per exit. Many thousand of glasseels pass through the system on a single day. The three exits in the left lower corner carry water from polluted sources (one is a drinking water reservoir).

EcoSCOPE systems have already been tracking water pollution and its effect on fish and plankton behavior in Europe and the United States). For the future it is anticipated to deploy ecoSCOPEs continuously online, within the project LEO Projekt off New York City, visible for the public. Tests have also been performed with different qualities of drinking water and with solutions of runoff juice from different samples of fish.

<doc id="243563" wikidata="Q1141437" url="?curid=243563" title="Max Goof">
<text>Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Goof is a cartoon character who is the son of the Disney character Goofy. He first appeared in the 1951 short &quot;Fathers Are People&quot; as Goofy Jr., and later appeared in the 1992 television series &quot;Goof Troop&quot; as Max Goof, a preteen. He then later appeared as a teenager in the spin-off film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), its direct-to-video sequel &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000), and in the 2001 TV series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; as a parking valet. He appeared as a child in the direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; (1999) and as a young adult in its sequel &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; (2004).

Max has also appeared as a playable character in video games such as &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1993) for the Super NES, &quot;Disney Golf&quot; (2002) for the PlayStation 2, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Extremely Goofy Skateboarding&quot; (2001) for PC CD.

==Origins==
The first appearance of Goofy&#x27;s son was in the 1951 theatrical short &quot;Fathers Are People&quot;. He is referred to as Goofy Junior or simply Junior. He later appeared in a few other shorts such as &quot;Father&#x27;s Lion&quot; (1952), &quot;Father&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (in which Goofy refers to his son as &quot;George&quot; at one point), &quot;Father&#x27;s Week-end&quot; (1953), and &quot;Aquamania&quot; (1961). In these earlier films, Goofy was also portrayed with a wife, though nameless and with her face always hidden from view. When &quot;Goof Troop&quot; was created, Goofy Junior evolved into Max, and Goofy&#x27;s wife was no longer on the scene. Disney Guest Services FAQ later stated there is no definitive answer regarding details of his mother, as one has not been revealed &quot;on the screen&quot;.

==Overview==
Max is one of the few Disney characters, aside from his best friend PJ and Huey, Dewey, and Louie, child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He is depicted as an 11-year-old in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, then a teenager in high school in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, and then in &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; he is a high school graduate starting college. In &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, he is still a teenager but one who is old enough to be employed as a parking valet. In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, he is a child who looks and sounds younger than he does in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;, he is a young adult who is returning home for the holidays.

Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy&#x27;s trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy (although that is a trait he does not display obviously in &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; during the College X-Games competition). He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his old man, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max, at one time reprimanding him to take personal responsibility by telling him about his (Max&#x27;s) great-uncle, Eliot Goof, an FBI agent with a never-give-up attitude (and a parody of Eliot Ness). In the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; show, there are times he would get suckered in by Pete and his get-rich-quick schemes, only to come around towards the end. It seems, personality wise, that PJ is more like Goofy at times, while Max seems more like Pete. Despite everything, Max loves his father, even if he does wish that Goofy would be a little more normal.

In the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; television series, Max is voiced by Dana Hill, while Shaun Fleming voices the younger Max in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;. Jason Marsden voices an older Max in all other appearances starting with &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;. The &quot;Goof Troop&quot; series shows some of his relatives – an older cousin named Debbie was featured in the episode &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;. In the Halloween episode &quot;Hallow-Weenies&quot; his father&#x27;s &quot;great-great-granddaddy&quot; was Gooferamus T. Goofy, while a &quot;Gooferamus G. Goof&quot; is instead referred in &quot;Calling All Goofs&quot; as Max&#x27;s &quot;great-great-great-grandpappy&quot;; at a family reunion in &quot;Calling All Goofs&quot; his relatives are Goofy&#x27;s Aunt Goophelia, Pattonleather Goof (Goofy&#x27;s great-uncle and a parody of General George S. Patton), Wernher von Goof (Goofy&#x27;s scientist cousin and a parody of Wernher von Braun), and M. Angelo Goof (Goofy&#x27;s artist uncle and a parody of Michelangelo). In &quot;the Old Country&quot; his father&#x27;s &quot;great-grand uncle&quot; was the late mad scientist Dr. Frankengoof. Other relatives include Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees A.K.A. &quot;Goofin&#x27; Hood&quot; (Max&#x27;s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddad, and a parody of Robin Hood), Sherlock Goof (Max&#x27;s great-great-great uncle and a parody of Sherlock Holmes), Mopalong Goofy (Max&#x27;s great-great-great-grandpa and a parody of Hopalong Cassidy), and Caveman Goof (Max&#x27;s and Goofy&#x27;s prehistoric ancestor). In one episode of &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Goofy says that Max was scared of the witch in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; when he was younger.

Over the course of his life, Max&#x27;s has been romantically involved with at least two young ladies. In &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, Max tries to impress a popular girl at his school named Roxanne, and ends up with her by the film&#x27;s end, but by the second movie, Max is apparently single again as he flirts with a number of other girls at the college. However, in an episode of &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, he and Roxanne are a couple once more, on a date at the titular House of Mouse. Later, in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;, Max is seen with yet another a girl named Mona, whom he brings home for Christmas to meet his father and attempts to impress her while trying not to be embarrassed by his father&#x27;s goofiness. Both Roxanne and Mona are voiced by Kellie Martin, except in the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; episode in which Roxanne is instead voiced by Grey DeLisle.

Max has a love for skateboarding, as shown in the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; episodes &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; and &quot;Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp&quot; and the films &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Goof Troop&quot;===
In the series &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Max is the son of Goofy Goof and the late Mrs. Goof, who was born in 1981, whereby in 1992 he is 11 years old. At the same age, Max moved to his father&#x27;s hometown of Spoonerville with him and has lived there ever since. He is active, nice, observant, friendly, and best friends with P.J., Pete&#x27;s son. He and P.J. are in the same grade at their junior high school. Max, like in all of his appearances, loves his father but wishes he would be a bit more normal, and dislikes the idea of sharing similarities with him. He wears purple baggy pants with a single diagonal yellow stripe on each leg, white gloves, yellow and green sneakers, and a red shirt. The first episode of Goof Troop is the first time we are introduced to Max as a character instead of Goofy Jr.

===&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;===
&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; in 1995 features Max as a 14-year-old high school student, finishing the school year before going on summer vacation. In this movie, Max has grown to find his father&#x27;s goofy antics embarrassing, and is likewise viewed by his peers as a geek and a goof himself; a view he seeks to change at the school assembly when he dresses up like the musician rock star Powerline and interrupts the principal&#x27;s speech to dance and perform to Powerline&#x27;s hit song &quot;Stand Out&quot; before the entire student body. Additionally, Max seeks to gain the attention of his crush, a girl named Roxanne, whom Max is convinced only ever looks right through him and believes the laugh he inherited from his father (&quot;a-hyuck&quot;) is to her disliking. Though Max ends up in detention for hijacking the assembly, he succeeds in not only impressing the other students but also winning the affections of Roxanne, who shyly yet delightedly agrees to go with him to a party that is to be held the next Saturday.

However, the principal informs Max&#x27;s father, Goofy, about Max&#x27;s bad behavior. Fearful that his son is becoming a delinquent, Goofy decides to take Max on a cross-country fishing trip for some &#x27;father-son bonding&#x27;, much to Max&#x27;s chagrin. Before Goofy and Max hit the road, Max pays a quick visit to Roxanne&#x27;s house to explain to her why he can no longer go with her to the party but ends up lying to her that it is because he is instead going to see Powerline live in concert in Los Angeles and that he and his father will join Powerline on stage for the last song since, as Max claims, Goofy and Powerline are an old acquaintance. The guilt from this lie eats at Max throughout the film, while Goofy tries to bond with his son in ways that end up pushing Max away even further. When Goofy appoints Max the official navigator of their road trip, things go much more smoothly for the two as Max gets to pick all the stops along the way.

But, unbeknownst to Goofy, Max had secretly changed the driving route on the map to lead them to Los Angeles, and when Goofy finds out, he and Max come to a head as the two finally let out all their held-back emotions at each other before they finally reach an understanding in which Max confesses to his dad how he has felt about Roxanne and the lie he told her before while Goofy explains that he just wants to be a part of Max&#x27;s life and that even though he&#x27;s all grown up, he is still Goofy&#x27;s son. By this point, Max and Goofy admit that they are stuck together and would not want to be with anyone else in this situation. The two actually make it to the Powerline concert, even appearing (accidentally) onstage. By the end of the film, when the two arrive back home, Max reveals to Roxanne that he lied, admitting that he just wanted her to like him. Roxanne in turn confesses that she already did like Max, revealing that the goofy laugh Max had been so embarrassed by was the very thing that led to her liking him. After Goofy&#x27;s car suddenly explodes due to the damage after it had fallen down the waterfall, he is sent crashing through the roof of Roxanne&#x27;s porch, at which point Max introduces Roxanne to his dad.

===&quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;===
In the direct-to-video sequel to &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; in 2000, Max is a high school graduate and leaves for college with his best friends P.J. and Bobby Zimuruski. He hopes to start a new life for himself and partake in the College X-Games competition and eventually graduate at 23, in 2004. Upon his arrival to the campus, he and his friends are met by the five-time X-Games champions, the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity. However, because the Gammas invited only Max and not P.J. and Bobby to join them, Max makes a bet against the Gammas&#x27; leader, Bradley Uppercrust III, to see who will be towel boy to the other should either win the X-Games.

Meanwhile, Goofy gets fired from his job (for an accident caused by his empty nest syndrome) and must go back to college to get a degree, as it is the only way for him to get a new job. He attends the same college as his son, much to Max&#x27;s dismay as he had hoped to finally get away from his father&#x27;s overbearing doting. Eventually, Max manages to distract his father by introducing him to Ms. Sylvia Marpole, the college&#x27;s librarian, who takes a romantic interest in Goofy and vice versa while Max sneaks off to practice his skateboarding. When Goofy gets a date with Sylvia, he rushes off to tell Max only to interfere with Max&#x27;s practice, resulting in the onlooking Bradley to misinterpret Goofy&#x27;s clumsy antics on Max&#x27;s skateboard for skill and offers Goofy membership to the Gammas. Max encourages his father to join, viewing it as another distraction to keep Goofy further away from his X-Games practices.

When Goofy inadvertently beats Max at the qualifying rounds for the College X-Games (thanks in part to some sneaky cheating by Bradley), Max ends up blowing up at his father, revealing his desires to get away from his father and estranges him completely by telling him to &quot;leave him alone and get his own life&quot;, sending Goofy into depression. When Goofy later overhears the Gammas&#x27; plan to cheat in the games, Goofy tries to warn his son, who does not believe him, as he still wants him out of his life. But once it becomes clear to Max (during the X-Games&#x27; final round) that the Gammas really have been cheating all along, Max realizes that Goofy was telling the truth and, feeling remorseful for disowning him and not listening to his warnings, redeems himself by asking his dad to fill in for the incapacitated P.J., which Goofy quickly accepts. During the final stretch of the triathlon, Bradley activates a rocket hidden in Max&#x27;s skateboard, causing an explosion that ends up trapping fellow Gamma member Tank underneath some fallen fiery debris. Max forgoes heading straight to the finish line to first rescue Tank (with help from Goofy) and ultimately manages to just barely beat Bradley to the finish line. 

Goofy graduates a year later in 2001, where Max is now 20. Both father and son make amends at Goofy&#x27;s graduation, and Max gives his father the X-Games championship trophy as an apology gift for his unkind behavior. The two part ways amicably, with Goofy - now cured of his empty nest syndrome - leaves Max to live his own life at college and heads on another date with Sylvia.

===&quot;House of Mouse&quot;===
In the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, Max is still a teenager (although considerably older than in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;) and works as the parking valet for the club, and appears to be most level-headed and calm of all the club&#x27;s employees. However, this may be because his duties are not nearly as important as some of the others, and his inclusions are just to help out the rest of the cast. Yet, in episodes that revolve around him or Goofy, his insecurities and personal flaws are much more noticeable and intentional.

In the episode &quot;Max&#x27;s Embarrassing Date&quot;, Max is off work and on a date with Roxanne at the House of Mouse. While all the main Disney cast (Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy) attempted to keep Goofy away from the two so as to not embarrass Max in front of Roxanne, they ended up embarrassing him themselves until Goofy finally cuts in to give Max and Roxanne some privacy for the night. Max makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot; when the villains are entering the House of Mouse.

===&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;===
In the direct-to-video traditionally animated film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, in the segment &quot;A Very Goofy Christmas&quot;, Max goes bicycling into the mall with his father, Goofy, to catch up to the mail truck in order to mail his letter to Santa. However, when their neighbor Pete tells Max that there is no such thing as Santa, Goofy goes out of his way to try to prove to Max that Santa does exist. However, after staying up all night with no luck, Goofy is filled with disappointment, leaving it to Max to cheer his father. In the end, Santa finally arrives to the joyful awe and wonderment of Goofy and Max. In this film, Max is a little boy but it is never explicitly stated how old he is, however as he and Goofy are neighbors with Pete at this time we can assume that &quot;A Very Goofy Christmas&quot; takes part during or after Goof Troop.

===&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;===
The direct-to-video animated film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; (a sequel to &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;) is currently Max&#x27;s latest appearance in any Disney media produced. In the segment titled &quot;Christmas Maximus&quot;, Max has grown up into a young adult. He brings his lady friend Mona (whom Max hopes to make his girlfriend) home for Christmas to meet his father. Goofy picks them up at the train station and brings them back to the house, where Goofy shows Mona Max&#x27;s baby pictures and unwittingly embarrasses Max with all his fatherly love. In the end, as Mona finds Goofy&#x27;s quirks to be endearing, Max decides to forget his embarrassment and join in the fun.

Max later appears (in a non-speaking role) with his father and the other characters in the last segment of the film, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Dog-Gone Christmas&quot;, in which they drive around the city in a snowplow to look for Pluto, who had previously run away after having angered Mickey. After Pluto returns, everyone (Max included) pulls up to Mickey&#x27;s house in the snowplow, exits the snowplow, and goes inside the house to celebrate Christmas. Max and everyone applaud Mickey and Pluto topping the Christmas tree with the star decoration, and then they all join in singing a short medley of &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; and &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; to close out the special.

During the end credits sequence, a pop-up book version of Max and Mona are seen sliding close to each other (presumably to share a kiss) before a pop-up version of Goofy covers them both from view with a picture frame containing credits specific to the &quot;Christmas Maximus&quot; segment. Later, the closing image of Goofy and Max holding a Christmas caroling book together from the end of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Dog-Gone Christmas&quot; is shown again towards the end of the credits, as the last time Max was seen in Disney animation for the next sixteen years.

===Other appearances===
In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, Goofy refers to &quot;Maxie&quot; by name in the episode &quot;Quack Pack!&quot;, when the former shows pictures of him and Max in his wallet, with one showing Max and P.J. and another with Max and Roxanne.

In the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, he makes a cameo appearance in his original &quot;Goof Troop&quot; look during the credits scene.

In a promotional video in honor of Disney Channel&#x27;s fortieth anniversary, a chibi version of Max appears on his skateboard swiping and drinking the milk bucket from the Greens before throwing it into the cake mix.

Max Goof is a playable character in the Idle RPG mobile game &quot;Disney Heroes Battle Mode&quot;.

== Disney Parks ==
At the Walt Disney World, Max is a meetable character, and is featured during the &quot;Move It! Shake It! Mousekedance It!&quot; parade. He and Goofy were also part of the &quot;Mickeys Magical TV World&quot; show in the Magic Kingdom.

At Tokyo Disneyland, Max occasionally appears with Goofy on floats in seasonal parades. He can also be found sometimes as a meetable character at the front of the park.

==Voice actors==

Bobby Driscoll voiced Goofy Junior from 1951 to 1952.

In 1992, when &quot;Goof Troop&quot; was created, Goofy Junior evolved to Max Goof as a preteen. Max was voiced by Dana Hill; Hill would continued to voice Max for commercials, Disney projects, promos, Disney parks and other miscellaneous material with the exception of &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; until her death in 1996.

In 1995, Max Goof became a teenager in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; where he is voiced by Jason Marsden, which became his first animated film that he worked on at the age of 18; Marsden continued to voice Max in &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; and other Disney projects.

Shaun Fleming voiced the young Max in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;.

<text>The following is a list of United States [[Major League Baseball]] teams that played in the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] during the 19th century. None of these teams, other than Athletic and Mutual, had actual names during this period; sportswriters however often applied creative monickers which are still, mistakenly, used today as &quot;team names&quot; following a convention established in 1951.

==Surviving teams==

===Major league===
*Boston: &quot;Red Stockings, &quot;Red Caps,&quot; &quot;Beaneaters&quot; 1876–1900 – now Atlanta Braves
*Brooklyn: &quot;Grays,&quot; &quot;Bridegrooms,&quot; &quot;Grooms,&quot; &quot;Superbas,&quot; &quot;Robins,&quot; &quot;Trolley Dodgers&quot; 1890–1900 – transferred from the American Association; now Los Angeles Dodgers
*Chicago &quot;White Stockings&quot;: 1876–1900 – now known as the Cubs
*Cincinnati: &quot;Red Stockings&quot; or &quot;Reds&quot; 1890–1900 – transferred from the American Association

*Philadelphia 1883–1900 – very occasionally tagged &quot;Quakers&quot; 1883–1890, most often &quot;Philadelphias&quot; in the style of the day, shortened to &quot;Phillies.&quot;
*Pittsburgh: 1887–1900 founded as Allegheny (a Pittsburgh suburb) and referred to in typical manner as &quot;Alleghenys&quot; 1883-1890, dubbed &quot;Pirates&quot; from 1891 – transferred from the American Association
*St. Louis &quot;Brown Stockings or &quot;Browns,&quot; later &quot;Red Stockings&quot; or &quot;Reds&quot; 1892–1900 – transferred from the American Association; now known as the Cardinals.

===Minor league===
*Buffalo Bisons 1879–1885 – moved to the minors in 1886 and played in Buffalo until 1970 before several moves. Suspended operations in 1973. A current minor league team bearing the &quot;Buffalo Bisons&quot; name, dating to 1979, claims this team as part of their official history.

<doc id="243577" wikidata="Q180284" url="?curid=243577" title="Jaw">
<text>The jaws are a pair of opposable articulated structures at the entrance of the mouth, typically used for grasping and manipulating food. The term &quot;jaws&quot; is also broadly applied to the whole of the structures constituting the vault of the mouth and serving to open and close it and is part of the body plan of humans and most animals.

==Arthropods==
In arthropods, the jaws are chitinous and oppose laterally, and may consist of &quot;mandibles&quot; or &quot;chelicerae&quot;. These jaws are often composed of numerous mouthparts. Their function is fundamentally for food acquisition, conveyance to the mouth, and/or initial processing (&quot;mastication&quot; or &quot;chewing&quot;). Many mouthparts and associate structures (such as pedipalps) are modified legs.

==Vertebrates==
In most vertebrates, the jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically, comprising an &quot;upper jaw&quot; and a &quot;lower jaw&quot;. The vertebrate jaw is derived from the most anterior two pharyngeal arches supporting the gills, and usually bears numerous teeth.
===Fish===

The vertebrate jaw probably originally evolved in the Silurian period and appeared in the Placoderm fish which further diversified in the Devonian. The two most anterior pharyngeal arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, respectively. The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull, permitting great mobility of the jaws. While there is no fossil evidence directly to support this theory, it makes sense in light of the numbers of pharyngeal arches that are visible in extant jawed vertebrates (the Gnathostomes), which have seven arches, and primitive jawless vertebrates (the Agnatha), which have nine.

The original selective advantage offered by the jaw may not be related to feeding, but rather to increased respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the buccal pump (observable in modern fish and amphibians) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans), in feeding, was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates. Many teleost fish have substantially modified jaws for suction feeding and jaw protrusion, resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved.

===Amphibians, reptiles, and birds===
The jaw in tetrapods is substantially simplified compared to fish. Most of the upper jaw bones (premaxilla, maxilla, jugal, quadratojugal, and quadrate) have been fused to the braincase, while the lower jaw bones (dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, and articular) have been fused together into a unit called the mandible. The jaw articulates via a hinge joint between the quadrate and articular. The jaws of tetrapods exhibit varying degrees of mobility between jaw bones. Some species have jaw bones completely fused, while others may have joints allowing for mobility of the dentary, quadrate, or maxilla. The snake skull shows the greatest degree of cranial kinesis, which allows the snake to swallow large prey items.

===Mammals===
In mammals, the jaws are made up of the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw). In the ape, there is a reinforcement to the lower jaw bone called the simian shelf. In the evolution of the mammalian jaw, two of the bones of the jaw structure (the articular bone of the lower jaw, and quadrate) were reduced in size and incorporated into the ear, while many others have been fused together. As a result, mammals show little or no cranial kinesis, and the mandible is attached to the temporal bone by the temporomandibular joints. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is a common disorder of these joints, characterized by pain, clicking and limitation of mandibular movement. Especially in the therian mammal, the premaxilla that constituted the anterior tip of the upper jaw in reptiles has reduced in size; and most of the mesenchyme at the ancestral upper jaw tip has become a protruded mammalian nose.

==Sea urchins==
Sea urchins possess unique jaws which display five-part symmetry, termed the &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s lantern&quot;. Each unit of the jaw holds a single, perpetually growing tooth composed of crystalline calcium carbonate.

<text>Hydraulic rescue tools, also known as jaws of life, are used by emergency rescue personnel to assist in the extrication of victims involved in vehicle accidents, as well as other rescues in small spaces. These tools include cutters, spreaders, and rams. Such devices were first used in 1963 as a tool to free race car drivers from their vehicles after crashes.

==History==
The Hurst Rescue Tool was invented by George Hurst, circa 1961, after he viewed a stock car race accident in which it took workers over an hour to remove an injured driver from his car. Previously rescuers often used circular saws for vehicle extrication, but these suffered from several drawbacks. Saws can create sparks, which could start a fire, create loud sounds, stress the victim(s), and often cut slowly. Alternatively, rescuers could try to pry open the vehicle doors with a crowbar or Halligan bar, but this could compromise the stability of the vehicle, or injure the victims further.

In comparison, hydraulic spreader-cutters are quieter, faster, stronger, and more versatile: they can cut, open, and even lift a vehicle. Hurst Performance began to export parts to a European company, Zumro ResQtec, to avoid import duty. Zumro ResQtec was interested in developing these tools for use in auto racing, with ResQtec targeting the European market and Hurst targeting the American market. The hydraulic spreader was originally developed in 1972 by Tim Smith and Mike Brick, who later developed a cutter and a hydraulic ram. When an occupant is trapped the tool is used to pry or cut the car to remove the occupant. It takes about two minutes to take the roof off a car. Mike Brick coined the phrase &quot;Jaws of Life&quot; after he observed people saying that their new device &quot;snatched people from the jaws of death&quot;, then used as a registered brand name for Hurst products. The name &quot;jaws of life&quot; is, however, used colloquially to describe other hydraulic rescue tools.

Brick later developed a single rescue tool that combines the functions (push, pull, cut and spread) of previous rescue tools, and patented it; the design is currently implemented as the Phoenix Rescue tool.

==Tool types==
===Cutters===
The cutter is a pair of hydraulically powered shears that is designed to cut through metal. Cutters are most commonly used to cut through a vehicle&#x27;s structure in an extraction operation. They are sometimes specified as to their capacity to cut a solid circular steel bar. Cutter blades are replaceable, and blade development progresses as vehicle technology progresses in order to be able to cope with the new car protection technology.

===Spreader===
A spreader is a hydraulic tool that is designed with two arms that come together in a narrow tip, and that uses hydraulic pressure to separate or spread the arms. The tip of the tool can be inserted into a narrow gap between two vehicle panels (such as between two doors, or between a door and a fender), then operated to create or widen an opening. Spreaders may also be used to &quot;pop&quot; vehicle doors from their hinges.

===Combination spreader===
While a cutter or spreader tool is designed for a particular application, a combination tool (also known as a combi-tool or spreader-cutter) combines cutting and spreading functions into a single tool. In operation, the tips of the spreader-cutter&#x27;s blades are wedged into a seam or gap—for example, around a vehicle door—and the device engaged. The hydraulic pump, attached to the tool or as a separate unit, powers a piston that pushes the blades apart with great force and spreads the seam. Once the seam has been spread, the now-open blades can be repositioned around the metal. The device is engaged in reverse and the blades close, cutting through metal. Repeating this process allows a rescuer to quickly open a gap wide enough to pull free a trapped victim. The blades can spread or cut with a force of several tons or kilonewtons with the tips of the blades spreading up to a meter.

This operation can also be performed by dedicated spreading and cutting tools, which are designed especially for their own operations and may be required for some rescues. Spreader-cutters sometimes have lower capabilities when compared to the dedicated tool (e.g. a smaller spreading range) but may be useful where space is at a premium on fire and rescue vehicles, or when the budget does not allow for a separate cutter and spreader tool.

Many manufacturers utilize the body of their dedicated cutting tool for the combination tool. Specially engineered combination blades that are designed to spread and cut are used on the cutter body. If the end user decides later to add a separate cutter and spreader, the blades of the combination tool can be changed to make it a cutter only.

===Extension rams===

An extension ram consists of a piston or telescoping cylinder that extends under hydraulic pressure to exert force on vehicle structures. Rams are used less often than spreader-cutters in auto rescues, but serve an important purpose of creating space in compacted vehicles. Rams can extend and apply directed force much further than the arms of a spreader, making them ideal for reaching deep into crushed vehicle compartments. For example, a ram may be used to push away the dashboard to free a trapped occupant’s legs. There are many types and sizes of rams, including single-piston, dual-piston and telescopic rams. Sizes commonly vary from to (extended). Rams use more hydraulic fluid during operation than spreader-cutters, so it is essential that the pump being used has enough capacity to allow the ram to reach full extension.

==Power==
The tools operate on the basis of the hydraulic fluid pressure of up to , which must be provided from a power source. At present, there are three different means of generating pressure. The most commonly used source is a separate power unit, small petrol (gasoline) engine connected to a hydraulic pump. The hydraulic fluid is pressurised in the pump and conveyed in a hose under pressure to the tool.

Alternative power sources are a small electrical pump in the tool powered by a heavy-duty rechargeable battery or hand- or foot-operated pumps, also connected to the tool directly. These are useful for lighter-duty use and do not require the storage space taken up by the separate power unit and associated lengths of hose.

Some manufacturers have begun offering all-electric products driving rotation motors or a screw piston. These are still relatively new on the market and thus may still be somewhat immature but potentially offer many benefits over hydraulic such as but not limited to lower cost of ownership, quicker, more direct and responsive operation, decreased weight, improved portability and handling, and greater reliability.

<text>Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers (1405 – 12 August 1469), also Wydeville, was the father of Elizabeth Woodville and father-in-law of Edward IV.

==Early life==
Born at Maidstone in Kent, Richard Woodville was the son of Richard Wydeville (Woodville), chamberlain to the Duke of Bedford, and Joan Bittlesgate (or Bedlisgate), the daughter of Thomas Bittlesgate of Knightstone in the parish of Ottery St Mary in Devon. He was also a grandson of John Wydeville who was Sheriff of Northamptonshire (in 1380, 1385, 1390).

==Marriage and courtly career==

Woodville followed his father into service with the Duke of Bedford. In 1433 the Duke had married the 17-year-old Jacquetta of Luxembourg; she was the Duke&#x27;s second wife and he was significantly older and in ill health. When the Duke died in 1435, Jacquetta was left a childless and wealthy widow. She was required to seek permission from King Henry VI before she could remarry, but in March 1437 it was revealed that she had secretly married Richard Woodville who was far below her in rank and not considered a suitable husband for the lady still honoured as the king&#x27;s aunt. The couple were fined £1000, but the sum was remitted in October of the same year.

Despite this inauspicious start, the married couple soon prospered, thanks mainly to Jacquetta&#x27;s continuing prominence within the royal family. She retained her rank and dower as Duchess of Bedford, which initially provided an income of between £7000 and £8000 per year, though over the years this amount diminished as a result of territorial losses in France and collapsing royal finances in England. Richard Woodville was honoured with military ranks, in which he proved himself a capable soldier.

Further honours for both came when Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, whose uncle was Jacquetta&#x27;s brother-in-law (Jacquetta&#x27;s sister Isabelle married Margaret of Anjou&#x27;s paternal uncle Charles du Maine). The Woodvilles were among those chosen to escort the bride to England, and the family benefited further through this double connection to the royal family. Sir Richard was raised to the rank of Baron Rivers in 1448. Therefore their children would grow up enjoying considerable privilege and material comfort.

==Military career==
Woodville was a captain in 1429, served in France in 1433 and was a knight of the regent Duke of Bedford in 1435. He was at Gerberoy in 1435 and served under William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, in 1435–36. He then fought under the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1439 and the Duke of York in 1441–42, when he was made captain of Alençon and knight banneret.

Woodville was created Baron Rivers by King Henry VI on 9 May 1448. Two years later, as Sir Richard, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1450. He was appointed seneschal of Gascony in 1450 (but failed to reach it before its fall) then lieutenant of Calais in 1454–55. He was appointed Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1459 to defend Kent against invasion by the Yorkist earls (but was captured at Sandwich).

In the Wars of the Roses, he was initially a Lancastrian, but he became a Yorkist when he thought that the Lancastrian cause was lost. He reconciled himself to the victorious Edward IV, his future son-in-law. On 1 May 1464, Edward married Rivers&#x27; daughter Elizabeth, widow of Lancastrian knight Sir John Grey. Richard Woodville was created Earl Rivers in 1466, appointed Lord Treasurer in March 1466 and Constable of England on 24 August 1467.

==Later career==
The power of this new family was very distasteful to the old baronial party, and especially so to the Earl of Warwick. Rivers was regarded as a social upstart, and in an ironical episode, his future son-in-law in 1460, while accepting his submission, had rebuked him for daring, given his lowly birth, to fight against the House of York. The Privy Council, in its horrified response to the King&#x27;s marriage, said bluntly that Richard Woodville&#x27;s low social standing in itself meant that the King must surely know &quot;that Elizabeth was not the wife for him&quot;. Early in 1468, the Rivers estates were plundered by Warwick&#x27;s partisans, and the open war of the following year was aimed at destroying the Woodvilles. After the Yorkist defeat at the Battle of Edgecote on 26 July 1469, Rivers and his third son John were taken prisoners at Chepstow. Following a hasty show trial, they were beheaded at Kenilworth on 12 August 1469.

Richard Woodville&#x27;s eldest surviving son Anthony succeeded him in the earldom.

Lord Rivers had a large family. His fourth son, Lionel (d. 1484) became the Bishop of Salisbury. All his daughters made great marriages: Katherine Woodville, his eighth daughter, was the wife of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.

&quot;Woodville&quot; is the modern spelling of the name: in their own time &quot;Wydeville&quot;, &quot;Wydville&quot; and other variants were used.

==Issue==

Richard and Jacquetta had 14 children:
* Elizabeth Woodville (c. 1437 – 1492), married first Sir John Grey of Groby, and second Edward IV of England.
* Lewis Woodville (c. 1438–1450), died in childhood.
* Anne Woodville (1439–1489), married first William Bourchier, Viscount Bourchier, and second George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent.
* Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers (1442–1483), married Elizabeth Scales, 8th Baroness Scales.
* Mary Woodville (1443–1481), married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke.
* John Woodville (1445–1469), married Katherine Neville, Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
* Jacquetta Woodville, Baroness Strange of Knockin (1445-1509), married John le Strange, 8th Baron Strange of Knockin.
* Lionel Woodville (1447–1484), Bishop of Salisbury.
* Martha Woodville (d. c. 1500), married Sir John Bromley of Baddington.
* Eleanor Woodville (1452–1512), married Sir Anthony Grey, son of Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent.
* Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers (1453–1491).
* Margaret Woodville (1454–1490), married Thomas FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel.
* Edward Woodville, Lord Scales (d. 1488), soldier and courtier.
* Katherine Woodville (c. 1458 – 1497), married first Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, second Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, she married third Sir Richard Wingfield.

Robert Glover, Somerset Herald, noted another &#x27;Richard&#x27; who would seem to have been born before Richard the 3rd Earl. A &#x27;Richard Woodville, esquire for the body&#x27; was present at the christening of Prince Arthur (son of Elizabeth and Henry VII) on 24 September 1486 in Winchester Cathedral; Arthur&#x27;s grandmother, Elizabeth Woodville, served as his Godmother, and her younger brother Edward was also present at the ceremony.

The Visitation of Buckinghamshire of 1566 mentions the marriage of William Dormer of Wycombe (only later of Ascott House) to &quot;Agnes, da. of Sir Richard Woodvyle, Erle Ryvers&quot; but does not say whether the father was the first or the third earl, who the mother was or whether Agnes was legitimate. Considering though that she is thought to be born about 1458 the more likely candidate is the senior Richard Woodville.

==In fiction==
Woodville is a primary character in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s 2011 novel about Jacquetta of Luxembourg, &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot;. In &quot;The White Queen&quot; television series, he is portrayed by Robert Pugh.
