<text>James Terry Conway (born December 26, 1947) is a retired United States Marine Corps four-star general who served as the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Among his previous postings were Director of Operations (J-3) on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Commanding General of 1st Marine Division and I Marine Expeditionary Force, taking part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the First Battle of Fallujah.

==Early life and education==
Conway was born in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in St. Louis, Missouri, and then attended Southeast Missouri State University, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1969 with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Conway is a graduate of the Infantry Officers Advanced Course, the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and the Air War College. He was commissioned as an infantry officer in 1970.

==Marine career==
Conway&#x27;s first assignment was command of a rifle platoon with 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, based at Camp Pendleton. He also served as the battalion&#x27;s 106mm recoilless rifle platoon commander. Later, he served as Marine detachment executive officer aboard the aircraft carrier and as commanding officer of the Sea School at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.

After graduating with honors from the Army&#x27;s Infantry Officers Advanced Course, Conway commanded two companies in the 2nd Marine Regiment&#x27;s Operations and Security section. As a field grade officer, he commanded two companies of students and taught tactics at The Basic School. He then went on to serve as operations officer for the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit, with sea duty in the western Pacific and in contingency operations off Beirut, Lebanon.

Returning to the United States, Conway was assigned as Senior Aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for two years. After graduating from Marine Corps Command and Staff College with honors, he took command of 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines through its eight-month deployment to Southwest Asia during the Gulf War.

After the war, he was promoted to colonel and assigned command of The Basic School. In 1992–1993, he attended MIT Seminar XXI. Promoted to brigadier general in December 1995, he again was assigned to the Joint Chiefs and later served as president of the Marine Corps University. After being promoted to major general, he served as commander of the 1st Marine Division and as Deputy Commanding General of Marine Forces Central. He was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) on November 16, 2002. He commanded I MEF during two combat tours in Iraq, with 60,000 troops under his command, including Marines, soldiers, sailors, and British forces. In the book &quot;The Iraq War&quot;, Conway was described as, &quot;big, buff, well read and well educated ... he represented all that was best about the new United States Marine Corps, which General Al Gray as the commandant had set up.&quot;

US Marines of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force under Conway&#x27;s command constructed the military base &quot;Camp Alpha&quot; on top of ancient Babylonian ruins following the invasion. Though a US Military spokesman claimed that the project was discussed with the &quot;head of the Babylon museum&quot;, the construction of the base drew intense criticism from archaeologists, who contend that it caused irreparable damage to one of the most important sites in the world.

On June 13, 2006, Conway was nominated by President George W. Bush to become the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps; the nomination was confirmed by the Senate on August 2, 2006. On November 13, Conway was promoted to the rank of general at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., and became the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps. He was the first Commandant in nearly 40 years to have not served in the Vietnam War.

On June 11, 2009, Conway spoke at the National Press Club about the importance of maintaining the Amphibious assault ships to lift two Marine Expeditionary Brigades and the time &quot;at home&quot; away from the current wars to train for amphibious assault.
Conway was reported to have had &quot;major reservations&quot; about the repeal of &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, in contrast to the Pentagon opinion that the younger rank and file of the military did not have such reservations about serving with openly gay service members. Conway, along with Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gary Roughead, and Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Casey, supported running a one-year study on the effects of a possible repeal. Conway said that if gay Marines are allowed to serve openly, he might need to change the policy that requires unmarried Marines to share rooms. The policy was repealed on December 22, 2010, after his tenure as Commandant had ended.

On October 22, 2010, Conway turned the position of Commandant over to General James F. Amos, his Assistant Commandant, at a ceremony at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., Defense Secretary Robert Gates presented Conway with his third Defense Distinguished Service Medal during the change-in-command. He then retired on November 1.

==Personal life==
Conway is married to Anette Conway and together they have three children, two sons, currently serving in the Marine Corps, and a daughter. 

Post-retirement, Conway has held many different positions including a board member seat for Textron, Colt Firearms, General Dynamics, and the Center for Naval Analysis, and xG technologies. He sits on the Board of Directors for Warriors &amp; Quiet Waters and is a member of the board of trustees for the Marine Corps University Foundation. 

Conway served as an adjunct faculty member of Georgetown University.

==Awards and decorations==
Conway has been decorated for service, to include: 


*He also holds 7 expert awards in both rifle and pistol marksmanship badges. In 2010, Conway was the recipient of the distinguished &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; award.

<doc id="252311" wikidata="Q1068763" url="?curid=252311" title="Rule of inference">
<text>In the philosophy of logic and logic, specifically in deductive reasoning, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). 

For example, the rule of inference called &quot;modus ponens&quot; takes two premises, one in the form &quot;If p then q&quot; and another in the form &quot;p&quot;, and returns the conclusion &quot;q&quot;. The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.

Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference&#x27;s action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.

Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include &quot;modus ponens&quot;, &quot;modus tollens&quot;, and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.

==Standard form==
In formal logic (and many related areas), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:

  Premise#1
&lt;br&gt;  Premise#2
&lt;br&gt;        ...
&lt;br&gt;  Premise#n   
&lt;br&gt;  Conclusion

This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:

: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3

This is the &quot;modus ponens&quot; rule of propositional logic. Rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables. In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions) to form an infinite set of inference rules.

A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called &quot;derivations&quot;. Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a &quot;hypothetical&quot; statement: &quot;&quot;if&quot; the premises hold, &quot;then&quot; the conclusion holds.&quot;

== Example: Hilbert systems for two propositional logics ==
In a Hilbert system, the premises and conclusion of the inference rules are simply formulae of some language, usually employing metavariables. For graphical compactness of the presentation and to emphasize the distinction between axioms and rules of inference, this section uses the sequent notation (formula_4) instead of a vertical presentation of rules.
In this notation, 

formula_5

is written as formula_6.

The formal language for classical propositional logic can be expressed using just negation (¬), implication (→) and propositional symbols. A well-known axiomatization, comprising three axiom schemata and one inference rule (&quot;modus ponens&quot;), is:

 (CA1) ⊢ &quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;)
 (CA2) ⊢ (&quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)) → ((&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;))
 (CA3) ⊢ (¬&quot;A&quot; → ¬&quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;)
 (MP) &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊢ &quot;B&quot;

It may seem redundant to have two notions of inference in this case, ⊢ and →. In classical propositional logic, they indeed coincide; the deduction theorem states that &quot;A&quot; ⊢ &quot;B&quot; if and only if ⊢ &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;. There is however a distinction worth emphasizing even in this case: the first notation describes a deduction, that is an activity of passing from sentences to sentences, whereas &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is simply a formula made with a logical connective, implication in this case. Without an inference rule (like &quot;modus ponens&quot; in this case), there is no deduction or inference. This point is illustrated in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s dialogue called &quot;What the Tortoise Said to Achilles&quot;, as well as later attempts by Bertrand Russell and Peter Winch to resolve the paradox introduced in the dialogue.
For some non-classical logics, the deduction theorem does not hold. For example, the three-valued logic of Łukasiewicz can be axiomatized as:

 (CA1) ⊢ &quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;)
 (LA2) ⊢ (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;) → ((&quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;) → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;))
 (CA3) ⊢ (¬&quot;A&quot; → ¬&quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;)
 (LA4) ⊢ ((&quot;A&quot; → ¬&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;A&quot;) → &quot;A&quot;
 (MP) &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊢ &quot;B&quot;

This sequence differs from classical logic by the change in axiom 2 and the addition of axiom 4. The classical deduction theorem does not hold for this logic, however a modified form does hold, namely &quot;A&quot; ⊢ &quot;B&quot; if and only if ⊢ &quot;A&quot; → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;).

==Admissibility and derivability==

In a set of rules, an inference rule could be redundant in the sense that it is &quot;admissible&quot; or &quot;derivable&quot;. A derivable rule is one whose conclusion can be derived from its premises using the other rules. An admissible rule is one whose conclusion holds whenever the premises hold. All derivable rules are admissible. To appreciate the difference, consider the following set of rules for defining the natural numbers (the judgment formula_7 asserts the fact that formula_8 is a natural number):

: formula_9

The first rule states that 0 is a natural number, and the second states that s(n) is a natural number if &quot;n&quot; is. In this proof system, the following rule, demonstrating that the second successor of a natural number is also a natural number, is derivable:

: formula_10

Its derivation is the composition of two uses of the successor rule above. The following rule for asserting the existence of a predecessor for any nonzero number is merely admissible:

: formula_11

This is a true fact of natural numbers, as can be proven by induction. (To prove that this rule is admissible, assume a derivation of the premise and induct on it to produce a derivation of formula_12.) However, it is not derivable, because it depends on the structure of the derivation of the premise. Because of this, derivability is stable under additions to the proof system, whereas admissibility is not. To see the difference, suppose the following nonsense rule were added to the proof system:

: formula_13

In this new system, the double-successor rule is still derivable. However, the rule for finding the predecessor is no longer admissible, because there is no way to derive formula_14. The brittleness of admissibility comes from the way it is proved: since the proof can induct on the structure of the derivations of the premises, extensions to the system add new cases to this proof, which may no longer hold.

Admissible rules can be thought of as theorems of a proof system. For instance, in a sequent calculus where cut elimination holds, the &quot;cut&quot; rule is admissible.

<text>James Hinton (baptised 26 November 1822 – 16 December 1875) was an English surgeon and author. He was the father of mathematician Charles Howard Hinton. He was an outspoken advocate of polygamy. He appears as a character in some fictional accounts of the 19th-century English serial murderer known as Jack the Ripper.

==Life==
He was born at Reading, Berkshire, the son of John Howard Hinton, Baptist minister and author of the &quot;History and Topography of the United States&quot; and other works. James was educated at his grandfather&#x27;s school near Oxford, and at the Nonconformist school at Harpenden, and in 1838, on his father&#x27;s removal to London, was apprenticed to a woollen-draper in Whitechapel. After working there for about a year he became clerk in an insurance office. His evenings were spent in intense study, and this, combined with a concentration on moral problems, so affected his health that, aged eighteen, he tried to seek refuge from his own thoughts by running away to sea. His intention having been discovered, he was sent, on the advice of his doctor, to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital to study for the medical profession. After receiving his diploma in 1847, he was for some time assistant surgeon at Newport, Essex, but the same year he went out to Sierra Leone to take medical charge of the free labourers on their voyage thence to Jamaica, where he stayed some time. He returned to England in 1850, and entered into partnership with a surgeon in London, where he soon had his interest awakened specially in aural surgery, and also studied physiology.

After being appointed aural surgeon to Guy&#x27;s Hospital in 1863, he soon acquired a reputation as the most skillful aural surgeon of his day. In the 1870s his health began to break down, and in 1874 he gave up practice. He died the following year at the Azores of &quot;acute inflammation of the brain&quot;.

== Writings ==

His career as an author started in 1856 with papers on physiological and ethical subjects to the &quot;Christian Spectator&quot;; and in 1859 he published &quot;Man and his Dwellingplace&quot;. A series of papers entitled &quot;Physiological Riddles,&quot; in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, afterwards published as &quot;Life in Nature&quot; (1862), as well as another series entitled &quot;Thoughts on Health&quot; (1871), proved his aptitude for popular scientific exposition. His specialist field of aural surgery was the subject of &quot;An Atlas of the membrana tympani with descriptive text; being illustrations of diseases of the ear&quot; (1874), and &quot;Questions of Aural Surgery&quot; (1874). In addition to the works already mentioned, he was the author of &quot;The Mystery of Pain&quot; (1866) and &quot;The Place of the Physician&quot; (1874). On account of their fresh and vigorous discussion of many of the important moral and social problems of the times his writings had a wide circulation on both sides of the Atlantic.

He was also a radical advocate of polygamous relationships, and according to his wife, had once remarked to her: &quot;Christ was the saviour of Men but I am the saviour of Women and I don&#x27;t envy him a bit.&quot; The notoriety of his writings on polygamy led to accusations in polite society of actual immorality leading to a renunciation of them just before he died.

His &quot;Life and Letters&quot;, edited by Ellice Hopkins, with an introduction by Sir WW Gull, appeared in 1878 but overlooked references to polygamy. Some philosophical writings were published posthumously, edited by his wife Margaret and sister-in-law Caroline Haddon. The polygamous aspects led to a campaign to discredit him, fronted especially by a group of London radicals, The Men and Women&#x27;s Club, founded in 1885 to discuss matters of gender and sexuality. Its success led to the discrediting too of his son, Charles Howard, whose bigamy was attributed to his father&#x27;s theories. In 1887, Charles Howard and Mary Ellen Boole, the eldest daughter of George Boole and Mary Everest, exiled their family to Japan.

==Portrayal in fiction==
Because of his association with Sir William Withey Gull, Hinton has been indirectly associated with the murders of Jack the Ripper.

In their fictional graphic novel on the Ripper, &quot;From Hell&quot;, authors Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell extend Hinton&#x27;s concern over social problems to prostitution in Whitechapel, which became the hunting grounds for the Ripper after his death. Their suggestion is that his concerns over prostitution among the lower classes greatly influenced Gull, who was put forward as a Ripper suspect in Stephen Knight&#x27;s 1976 book, &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;.

In &quot;From Hell&quot;, Hinton is portrayed as an idealistic doctor given to &quot;passionate outbursts&quot; and flights of metaphysical theorising and speculation. His character is used as a complementary figure to the more worldly – and less compassionate – Dr. Gull.

Hinton&#x27;s association with the murders has much to do with both Knight&#x27;s book and Iain Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings&quot;.

<doc id="252313" wikidata="Q132226" url="?curid=252313" title="Cypripedioideae">
<text>Cypripedioideae is a subfamily of orchids commonly known as lady&#x27;s slipper orchids, lady slipper orchids or slipper orchids. Cypripedioideae includes the genera &quot;Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium&quot; and &quot;Selenipedium&quot;. They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labella) of the flowers – the pouch traps insects so they are forced to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower. There are approximately 165 species in the subfamily.

==Description==
All representatives of the Cypripedioideae are perennial, herbaceous plants. The fleshy roots sometimes possess a veil. The leaves are arranged spirally or in two rows, the shoot is slender or compressed. In the bud, the leaves are rolled and the leaf blade is plikat (folded) or the leaves are folded in the bud, smooth and leathery. There is no dividing tissue between leaf and shoot.

The inflorescence of the Cypripedioideae are terminal and mostly unbranched. The flowers are spiral or in two lines on the shoot, they are resupinated. The petals are in two threefold circles, with mostly two petals of the outer circle are completely fused. The labellum forms a sac-like structure. The ovary is under constant and one-chambered or three-chambered. Two fertile stamens, a staminode and style are fused into a complex structure. The stylus is short and thick, the stigma is large and convex, the central lobe of the stigma is larger than the two lateral ones. The two lateral stamens are fertile, the pollen grains are glued together to form a paste or formed into connected pollinia in some &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; species. The middle, barren stamen is shield-shaped widened. The fruits are mostly capsule fruits, with Selenipedium they are berry-like. They contain numerous flattened seeds, about a millimeter long and 0.1 millimeters wide. In contrast, the seeds of Selenipedium are lens-shaped and have a hard seed coat.

Chromosome numbers vary within the subfamily over a wide range from 2n=20 in &quot;Cypripedium&quot; to 26 to 44 chromosomes in &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;. The chromosomes are quite large.

The species in this subfamily form trap flowers in which insect access to the saclike lip from the front is quite easy. The inside is designed in such a way that the insects climb out of the flower past the stigma and the stamens and thereby pollinate the flower.
==Distribution==
The species in the subfamily Cypripedioideae are found in northern South America and Central America (Mexipedium, Phragmipedium, Selenipedium), circumboreal in North America, Europe, Africa (Algeria) and in northern Asia (Cypripedium) as well as in subtropical and tropical Southeast Asia (Paphiopedilum). They do not occur in Australia and Africa. The spread could have started from a center of origin in Central America.

==Taxonomy==

Unlike most other orchids, slipper orchids have two fertile anthers — they are &quot;diandrous&quot;. For that reason, experts have debated whether this clade should be classified within the orchid family (Orchidaceae), or whether they should compose a separate family altogether called Cypripediaceae. Around the year 2000, molecular phylogenetics and DNA sampling have come to play an increasingly important role in classification. This has led to the conclusion that recognition of a distinct family Cypripediaceae would be inappropriate.

The subfamily Cypripedioideae is monophyletic and consists of five genera:

:* &quot;Cypripedium&quot;, found across much of North America, as well as in parts of Europe (one species), Africa (only in Algeria has been discovered in 2019) and Asia. The state flower of Minnesota is the showy lady&#x27;s slipper (&quot;Cypripedium reginae&quot;); the pink lady&#x27;s slipper (&quot;Cypripedium acaule&quot;) is the official flower of the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island.
:* &quot;Mexipedium&quot;, a monotypic genus, consisting of a single species that was found in a single locality in Oaxaca, Mexico.
:* &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, found in the tropical forests of southeast Asia reaching as far north as southern China. &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; is quite easy to cultivate and therefore is popular among orchid enthusiasts. In fact, over-collection of this genus has been so extensive that many species are now sub-viable in their natural habitats.
:* &quot;Phragmipedium&quot;, found across northern South and Central America, is also easy to cultivate as it requires lower temperatures than &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, eliminating the need for a greenhouse in many areas.
:* &quot;Selenipedium&quot;, found in Central and South America.

== Intergeneric hybrids ==
Hybrids between the genera in this subfamily are placed in the following nothogenera:
* × &quot;Cyphiopedilum&quot; (&quot;Cphd.&quot;) = &quot;Cypripedium&quot; × &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;
* × &quot;Cyphragmipedium&quot; (&quot;Cgd.&quot;) = &quot;Cypripedium&quot; × &quot;Phragmipedium&quot;
* × &quot;Phragmipaphium&quot; (&quot;Phrphm.&quot;) = &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; × &quot;Phragmipedium&quot;
Hybrids with genera outside of the subfamily are not known as of 2017.

<text>Manufacturing, Science and Finance (or the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union; almost exclusively known as MSF) was a trade union in Britain. Over eighty members of Parliament (primarily members of the Labour Party) were members.

==History==
The MSF was the result of a merger in January 1988 between the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) and the Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section (TASS). In 1991, it had 604,000 members, but this fell to 446,000 in 1996, the most rapid decline of any major British union.

In 2001 the MSF merged with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union to form Amicus. The General Secretary of MSF from 1992 until the merger with Amicus was Roger Lyons, who continued as Joint General Secretary of Amicus&#x27;s MSF section. In 2007 Amicus merged with the TGWU to form Unite.

==Amalgamations==
Several unions amalgamated with the MSF:

* 1988: Church of England Children&#x27;s Society Staff Association, Imperial Supervisors&#x27; Association, United Friendly Field Management Staff Association
* 1989: Imperial Group Staff Association
* 1990: Health Visitors&#x27; Association
* 1991: Australian Mutual Provident Society
* 1993: Hospital Physicists Association, National Union of Scalemakers
* 1994: Ceron Research Staff Association
* 1997: College of Health Care Chaplains
* 1998: Communication Managers&#x27; Association
* 1999: Britannic Supervisory Union, Corporation of London Staff Association, National Union of Insurance Workers, Neilson Staff Association
* 2000: Lloyds Registry Staff Association, Union of Textile Workers
* 2001: Leicester Housing Association Staff Association

<doc id="252319" wikidata="Q5262358" url="?curid=252319" title="Derek Simpson (trade unionist)">
<text>Derek Simpson (born 23 December 1944) is a British trade unionist who was the Joint-General Secretary of the UK&#x27;s biggest private-sector trade union, Unite, from 2007 until 2010. He was previously the General Secretary of Amicus from 2002 until its merger with the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union to form Unite in 2007.

==Early life==
Derek Simpson was born and educated in Sheffield. He was an only child with an absent father. He attended Sheffield Central Technical School (a technical school, which transferred to the Ashleigh School in Gleadless and was then demolished having merged to become Myrtle Springs School which is now Sheffield Springs Academy).

In 1987 he received an Open University BSc in computing and mathematics. He was appointed an honorary fellow of Sheffield Hallam University in 1999.

==Career==
From 1960 to 1966 he worked for Firth Brown Tools, then Balfour Darwin from 1966 to 1981, then working full-time as a union official.

===AEU===
He joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) on becoming an apprentice at the age of 15. He became an AEU shop steward at Balfour Darwin in 1967 and held a number of increasingly senior union positions in workplaces where he was employed, learning his politics in what described as &quot;the socialist republic of South Yorkshire&quot;. In 1981 he became a full-time union official, becoming the AEU&#x27;s District Secretary for Sheffield. He was still working for the union in that city when he stood for the position of Joint General Secretary in 2002.

=== General Secretary of Amicus ===
Simpson was the surprise winner of the June 2002 election for the position of Joint General Secretary of the AEEU Section of Amicus. He beat Tony Blair&#x27;s &#x27;favourite trade unionist&#x27; – Sir Ken Jackson. He assumed the position of General Secretary in May 2004 following the departure of the MSF Section&#x27;s JGS, Roger Lyons.

In the above election, Simpson was seen as the left candidate, and was backed by the broad left in the AEEU, now known as Amicus Unity Gazette. During this election campaign he appeared at fringe meetings of the Amicus MSF section conference in Blackpool, defying an instruction from Jackson not to attend. He was still identified with the Unity Gazette and appeared at their national meetings until 2008, when he helped launch a rival &quot;Workers Uniting Group&quot;.

Simpson has repeatedly denied press claims that he was part of the &quot;Awkward Squad&quot; of trade union leaders opposed to New Labour policies, that they perceive to be against the interests of working people. Simpson stated that he is not in the awkward squad: &quot;I get named as such, but it&#x27;s astonishing that nobody&#x27;s able to back that up with any fact&quot;.

Since becoming General Secretary, he has been supportive of the links between Amicus and the Labour Party. A member of the Communist Party of Great Britain until its disbanding in 1991, he joined the Labour Party in 1994. He was involved in the negotiation that let to the 2004 Warwick Agreement, in which the Labour Party agreed to implement some of the trade unions&#x27; policies during their third term. He favoured the early departure of Tony Blair as Labour Party Leader and Prime Minister.

=== Joint General Secretary of Unite ===
On 9 October 2008, the Executive Council of Unite decided that there would be an election for the General Secretary (Amicus section), with a timetable of January/February 2009 for the election, the results to be announced in March 2009. This election was for a fixed term until December 2010. The Executive council also postponed the merger of the union and adoption of the new rule book until May 2009.

In May 2010, during confidential negotiations with British Airways under the chairmanship of conciliation service Acas to resolve an ongoing dispute, Simpson was found to be using his BlackBerry to update his Twitter account with progress of the confidential negotiations.

==Personal life==
Simpson met his first wife Freda when working at a greyhound track, parading the dogs and setting the traps. They married on 23 December 1967 in Sheffield. They divorced in 1974, and in 1976 Simpson married Linda Gilliver; they have two sons (born 1980 and September 1986) and a daughter (born 1982). Simpson then divorced Linda, and remarried Freda, who has two sons (born 1979 and August 1984) and a daughter (born 1977) from her previous marriage.

<doc id="252322" wikidata="Q603258" url="?curid=252322" title="Georges River">
<text>The Georges River, also known as Tucoerah River, is an intermediate tide-dominated drowned valley estuary, that is located in Sydney, Australia. The Georges River is located south and south-west from the Sydney central business district, with the mouth of the river being at Botany Bay.

The river travels for approximately in a north and then easterly direction to its mouth at Botany Bay, about from the Tasman Sea. The Georges River is the main tributary of Botany Bay; with the Cooks River being a secondary tributary.

The total catchment area of the river is approximately and the area surrounding the river is managed by various local government authorities and NSW Government agencies across Sydney.

The land adjacent to the Georges River was occupied for many thousands of years by the Tharawal and Eora peoples. They used the river as an important source of food and a place for trade.

==Geography==
From its source east of Appin within heath habitat of Wollondilly Shire and Wollongong Local government area, the Georges River flows north through rugged sandstone gorges to the east of Campbelltown, roughly parallel to the Main South railway line, with its eastern bank forming a boundary of Holsworthy Army Base. At Glenfield it reaches the urban environment and then travels to Liverpool where the river turns east and flows past the suburbs of East Hills, Lugarno, and Blakehurst, before emptying into Botany Bay at Taren Point/Sansouci in the southern suburbs of Sydney, where it joins with the estuarine catchment.

Major tributaries include O&#x27;Hares Creek, Bunbury Curran Creek, Cabramatta Creek, Lennox River (proposed), Prospect Creek, Salt Pan Creek and the Woronora River. The Georges River is popular for recreational activities such as water skiing and swimming. The banks of the river along the lower reaches are marked by large inlets and indentations overlooked by steep sandstone ridges and scarps, many being home to expensive residential properties.

The Georges River features some artificial lakes in the suburb of Chipping Norton, near Liverpool. These lakes, known as the Chipping Norton Lake, are the result of sand mining and quarrying operations in the twentieth century. The Lakes are now a popular watersports and recreational facility for the residents of the south-western suburbs of Sydney.

Liverpool Weir now forms the uppermost tidal limit and presence of salt water on the Georges River.

From Appin to Glenfield, a large corridor has been protected as part of the Georges River Regional Open Space Corridor. Council reserves allow for access to natural sections of the river at Simmo&#x27;s Beach, Ingleburn Reserve, Keith Longhurst Reserve, and Frere&#x27;s Crossing.

Botany Bay Community River Health Monitoring Program is a community-based initiative to monitor ecosystem health catchment.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Georges River was formerly known as Tucoerah (or Toggerai / Tuggerah) River by the traditional custodians of the area. It is not known whether this word referred to the whole river or rather just a part of it. Mill Creek, a tributary of Tucoerah was called Guragurang.

To the south of Tocoerah are the traditional lands of the Dharawal people. The Dharug/Eora people are the traditional custodians of the land on its northern banks.

===European history===
The Georges River was given its English name in honour of King George III, by Governor Arthur Phillip. It was one of the many sites of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, a series of wars between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the resisting Indigenous clans in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

One of the earliest contacts between British settlers and Aboriginal people occurred on 20 January 1788. Arthur Phillip and Philip Gidley King, leading a party of seamen from the First Fleet rowing two open boats, explored the &#x27;South-West Arm of Botany Bay&#x27; (now Georges River). They are now thought to have gone as far as Lime Kiln Bay, where they landed at two locations there, the first of which they called &#x27;Lance Point&#x27;—thought to be modern-day Gertrude Point, Lugarno—where an altercation with local people occurred. Later the same day, there was a peaceful meeting at what is now thought to have been the head of Lime Kiln Bay. They are also now believed to have entered the estuarine mouth of the Georges Rivers&#x27; tributary, Woronora River. Not finding enough freshwater, around Botany Bay and its two &#x27;arms&#x27;, the colonists moved on to Port Jackson, where the settlement of Sydney began six days later.

The river was explored by Bass and Flinders in 1795 on their first voyage on the Tom Thumb after their arrival in New South Wales. The exploration led to the establishment of Bankstown.

A dam was constructed by David Lennox using convict labour at Liverpool in 1836, as a water supply to Liverpool.

Oyster farming on Georges River occurred between around 1870 and 2023, in the part of the river estuary downstream from Salt Pan Creek.

In February 2007, Liverpool and Campbelltown City Council were awarded a $2 million grant from the NSW Environmental Trust under their Urban Sustainability Initiative. The grant was to allow the councils, in conjunction with Wollondilly Shire Council and the Georges River Combined Councils Committee, to develop a Comprehensive Strategic Plan focused on the rehabilitation of the catchment area.

Since the 2010s, the Mandaean community in the Greater Sydney region has been using the Georges River for their ritual baptisms, called &quot;masbuta&quot;. Along with the Nepean River, it is one of the few ritual rivers (called &quot;yardna&quot; in Mandaic) that they use for their baptism and ablution rituals.

== Crossings ==

== Fish ==

The Georges River is a popular area for recreational fishing. Species present in the river include bass, bream, whiting, yellowtail, jewfish and flathead. The river was once host to a number of commercial oyster farms. The upper ends of the Georges River are abundant with Bass during the summer months and during the winter months these bass migrate down to the lower ends of the river towards the salt water to breed. Waste water inflows to the river are carefully managed to maintain the estuarine habitat.

<doc id="252326" wikidata="Q7893791" url="?curid=252326" title="Unity Gazette">
<text>Unity Gazette is a broad left caucus group in the Amicus trade union in the United Kingdom. It includes activists from the former Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF) and Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) trade unions which merged to form Amicus. The broad left of AEEU was also known as Unity Gazette or Engineering Gazette. Recent mergers between Amicus and UNIFI and GPMU have resulted in new members from those unions.

Unity Gazette is often known as &quot;the Gazette&quot; or &quot;the Left&quot; by supporters and opponents alike.

Membership of Unity Gazette is open to any lay member or employee of Amicus who shares its aims, regardless of any position they may hold within the union.

Grass-roots activity of the Gazette is organised on a regional basis, each region being permitted a high degree of autonomy in how it organises its own activities. In some regions, candidates for membership must be proposed, seconded and approved by the attendees at the regional meeting, while other regions grant membership immediately on request.

National Gazette policy is decided at National Meetings, which normally take place every three months in Preston, Lancashire. At all other times the Editorial Committee are empowered to run the affairs of the national Gazette.

Activities of Unity Gazette include:
* Regular national and regional meetings to decide policy and lists of candidates, which all members are then mandated to support.
* Encouragement of members who belong to the Labour Party to stand for election to the Amicus Political Committees, which are only open to Labour Party members.
* Publicising and encouraging support for Amicus campaigns and industrial disputes.

The Gazette was instrumental in campaigning for two rule changes which were approved by the union&#x27;s 2005 Policy and Rules Conference. The first introduced area committees, consisting of workplace representatives from a given geographical area. Such structures existed in the AEEU. The second, much more controversial rule change, introduced election of full-time officers rather than appointment; although an election was held for the Regional Secretary of the Yorkshire and Humberside, it is highly unlikely that any more elections of officers will take place in Amicus, and there is no provision for election of officers within the new union formed by the merger of Amicus and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union.

At the Unity Gazette Annual General Meeting held on 2007-03-10, members voted to support a statement of intent to merge with the TGWU Broad Left organisation at the earliest opportunity, to maximise the role of both organisations&#x27; activists in the new union.

Unity Gazette is completely self-financing, by means of members&#x27; donations.

The name Unity Gazette derives from a newspaper of the same name which had a regular print run and was circulated within AEEU workplaces. This paper was not printed for many years except as a special edition for conferences and in response to industrial disputes. In April 2006 the Unity Gazette was revived as a monthly newsletter which is available on the website and is delivered to supporters by email or post.

Another caucus group within the union, with different aims, is ATU Network. That group seeks to attract Labour-supporting members of Amicus who are sympathetic to Blairism. It is currently smaller than the Gazette, with a much lower profile. However it is believed to have opposed the Gazette&#x27;s campaign for election of full-time officers.

<doc id="252329" wikidata="Q1771121" url="?curid=252329" title="Sequent calculus">
<text>In mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a style of formal logical argumentation in which every line of a proof is a conditional tautology (called a sequent by Gerhard Gentzen) instead of an unconditional tautology. Each conditional tautology is inferred from other conditional tautologies on earlier lines in a formal argument according to rules and procedures of inference, giving a better approximation to the natural style of deduction used by mathematicians than David Hilbert&#x27;s earlier style of formal logic, in which every line was an unconditional tautology. More subtle distinctions may exist; for example, propositions may implicitly depend upon non-logical axioms. In that case, sequents signify conditional theorems of a first-order theory rather than conditional tautologies.

Sequent calculus is one of several extant styles of proof calculus for expressing line-by-line logical arguments.
* Hilbert style. Every line is an unconditional tautology (or theorem).
* Gentzen style. Every line is a conditional tautology (or theorem) with zero or more conditions on the left.
** Natural deduction. Every (conditional) line has exactly one asserted proposition on the right.
** Sequent calculus. Every (conditional) line has zero or more asserted propositions on the right.
In other words, natural deduction and sequent calculus systems are particular distinct kinds of Gentzen-style systems. Hilbert-style systems typically have a very small number of inference rules, relying more on sets of axioms. Gentzen-style systems typically have very few axioms, if any, relying more on sets of rules.

Gentzen-style systems have significant practical and theoretical advantages compared to Hilbert-style systems. For example, both natural deduction and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions can be manipulated according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels the way in which mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. Natural deduction systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.

==Overview==

In proof theory and mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a family of formal systems sharing a certain style of inference and certain formal properties. The first sequent calculi systems, LK and LJ, were introduced in 1934/1935 by Gerhard Gentzen as a tool for studying natural deduction in first-order logic (in classical and intuitionistic versions, respectively). Gentzen&#x27;s so-called &quot;Main Theorem&quot; (&quot;Hauptsatz&quot;) about LK and LJ was the cut-elimination theorem, a result with far-reaching meta-theoretic consequences, including consistency. Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, in surprising response to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. Since this early work, sequent calculi, also called Gentzen systems, and the general concepts relating to them, have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and automated deduction.

===Hilbert-style deduction systems===

One way to classify different styles of deduction systems is to look at the form of &quot;judgments&quot; in the system, &quot;i.e.&quot;, which things may appear as the conclusion of a (sub)proof. The simplest judgment form is used in Hilbert-style deduction systems, where a judgment has the form
:formula_1
where formula_1 is any formula of first-order logic (or whatever logic the deduction system applies to, &quot;e.g.&quot;, propositional calculus or a higher-order logic or a modal logic). The theorems are those formulas that appear as the concluding judgment in a valid proof. A Hilbert-style system needs no distinction between formulas and judgments; we make one here solely for comparison with the cases that follow.

The price paid for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style system is that complete formal proofs tend to get extremely long. Concrete arguments about proofs in such a system almost always appeal to the deduction theorem. This leads to the idea of including the deduction theorem as a formal rule in the system, which happens in natural deduction.

===Natural deduction systems===

In natural deduction, judgments have the shape
:formula_3
where the formula_4&#x27;s and formula_1 are again formulas and formula_6. In other words, a judgment consists of a &quot;list&quot; (possibly empty) of formulas on the left-hand side of a turnstile symbol &quot;formula_7&quot;, with a single formula on the right-hand side, (though permutations of the formula_4&#x27;s are often immaterial). The theorems are those formulae formula_1 such that formula_10 (with an empty left-hand side) is the conclusion of a valid proof.
(In some presentations of natural deduction, the formula_4s and the turnstile are not written down explicitly; instead a two-dimensional notation from which they can be inferred is used.)

The standard semantics of a judgment in natural deduction is that it asserts that whenever formula_12, formula_13, etc., are all true, formula_1 will also be true. The judgments
:formula_15
and
:formula_16
are equivalent in the strong sense that a proof of either one may be extended to a proof of the other.

===Sequent calculus systems===

Finally, sequent calculus generalizes the form of a natural deduction judgment to
: formula_17
a syntactic object called a sequent. The formulas on left-hand side of the turnstile are called the &quot;antecedent&quot;, and the formulas on right-hand side are called the &quot;succedent&quot; or &quot;consequent&quot;; together they are called &quot;cedents&quot; or &quot;sequents&quot;. Again, formula_4 and formula_19 are formulas, and formula_20 and formula_21 are nonnegative integers, that is, the left-hand-side or the right-hand-side (or neither or both) may be empty. As in natural deduction, theorems are those formula_1 where formula_10 is the conclusion of a valid proof.

The standard semantics of a sequent is an assertion that whenever &quot;every&quot; formula_24 is true, &quot;at least one&quot; formula_19 will also be true. Thus the empty sequent, having both cedents empty, is false. One way to express this is that a comma to the left of the turnstile should be thought of as an &quot;and&quot;, and a comma to the right of the turnstile should be thought of as an (inclusive) &quot;or&quot;. The sequents
:formula_26
and
:formula_27
are equivalent in the strong sense that a proof of either sequent may be extended to a proof of the other sequent.

At first sight, this extension of the judgment form may appear to be a strange complication—it is not motivated by an obvious shortcoming of natural deduction, and it is initially confusing that the comma seems to mean entirely different things on the two sides of the turnstile. However, in a classical context the semantics of the sequent can also (by propositional tautology) be expressed either as
:: formula_28
(at least one of the As is false, or one of the Bs is true) 
:or as
:: formula_29
(it cannot be the case that all of the As are true and all of the Bs are false).
In these formulations, the only difference between formulas on either side of the turnstile is that one side is negated. Thus, swapping left for right in a sequent corresponds to negating all of the constituent formulas. This means that a symmetry such as De Morgan&#x27;s laws, which manifests itself as logical negation on the semantic level, translates directly into a left–right symmetry of sequents—and indeed, the inference rules in sequent calculus for dealing with conjunction (∧) are mirror images of those dealing with disjunction (∨).

Many logicians feel that this symmetric presentation offers a deeper insight in the structure of the logic than other styles of proof system, where the classical duality of negation is not as apparent in the rules.

===Distinction between natural deduction and sequent calculus===

Gentzen asserted a sharp distinction between his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He wrote that the intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ in the case of intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem (&quot;Hauptsatz&quot;).

===Origin of word &quot;sequent&quot;===

The word &quot;sequent&quot; is taken from the word &quot;Sequenz&quot; in Gentzen&#x27;s 1934 paper. Kleene makes the following comment on the translation into English: &quot;Gentzen says &#x27;Sequenz&#x27;, which we translate as &#x27;sequent&#x27;, because we have already used &#x27;sequence&#x27; for any succession of objects, where the German is &#x27;Folge&#x27;.&quot;

== Proving logical formulas ==
=== Reduction trees ===
Sequent calculus can be seen as a tool for proving formulas in propositional logic, similar to the method of analytic tableaux. It gives a series of steps that allows one to reduce the problem of proving a logical formula to simpler and simpler formulas until one arrives at trivial ones.

Consider the following formula:
:formula_30

This is written in the following form, where the proposition that needs to be proven is to the right of the turnstile symbol formula_7:
:formula_32

Now, instead of proving this from the axioms, it is enough to assume the premise of the implication and then try to prove its conclusion. Hence one moves to the following sequent:
:formula_33

Again the right hand side includes an implication, whose premise can further be assumed so that only its conclusion needs to be proven:
:formula_34

Since the arguments in the left-hand side are assumed to be related by conjunction, this can be replaced by the following:
:formula_35

This is equivalent to proving the conclusion in both cases of the disjunction on the first argument on the left. Thus we may split the sequent to two, where we now have to prove each separately:
:formula_36
:formula_37

In the case of the first judgment, we rewrite formula_38 as formula_39 and split the sequent again to get:
:formula_40
:formula_41

The second sequent is done; the first sequent can be further simplified into:
:formula_42

This process can always be continued until there are only atomic formulas in each side. 
The process can be graphically described by a rooted tree, as depicted on the right. The root of the tree is the formula we wish to prove; the leaves consist of atomic formulas only. The tree is known as a reduction tree.

The items to the left of the turnstile are understood to be connected by conjunction, and those to the right by disjunction. Therefore, when both consist only of atomic symbols, the sequent is accepted axiomatically (and always true) if and only if at least one of the symbols on the right also appears on the left.

Following are the rules by which one proceeds along the tree. Whenever one sequent is split into two, the tree vertex has two child vertices, and the tree is branched. Additionally, one may freely change the order of the arguments in each side; Γ and Δ stand for possible additional arguments.

The usual term for the horizontal line used in Gentzen-style layouts for natural deduction is inference line.

Starting with any formula in propositional logic, by a series of steps, the right side of the turnstile can be processed until it includes only atomic symbols. Then, the same is done for the left side. Since every logical operator appears in one of the rules above, and is removed by the rule, the process terminates when no logical operators remain: The formula has been &quot;decomposed&quot;.

Thus, the sequents in the leaves of the trees include only atomic symbols, which are either provable by the axiom or not, according to whether one of the symbols on the right also appears on the left.

It is easy to see that the steps in the tree preserve the semantic truth value of the formulas implied by them, with conjunction understood between the tree&#x27;s different branches whenever there is a split. It is also obvious that an axiom is provable if and only if it is true for every assignment of truth values to the atomic symbols. Thus this system is sound and complete for classical propositional logic.

=== Relation to standard axiomatizations ===

Sequent calculus is related to other axiomatizations of classical propositional calculus, such as Frege&#x27;s propositional calculus or Jan Łukasiewicz&#x27;s axiomatization (itself a part of the standard Hilbert system): Every formula that can be proven in these has a reduction tree. This can be shown as follows: Every proof in propositional calculus uses only axioms and the inference rules. Each use of an axiom scheme yields a true logical formula, and can thus be proven in sequent calculus; examples for these are shown below. The only inference rule in the systems mentioned above is modus ponens, which is implemented by the cut rule.

==The system LK==

This section introduces the rules of the sequent calculus LK (standing for Logistische Kalkül) as introduced by Gentzen in 1934.
A (formal) proof in this calculus is a finite sequence of sequents, where each of the sequents is derivable from sequents appearing earlier in the sequence by using one of the rules below.

===Inference rules===

The following notation will be used:
* formula_7 known as the turnstile, separates the &quot;assumptions&quot; on the left from the &quot;propositions&quot; on the right
* formula_44 and formula_1 denote formulas of first-order predicate logic (one may also restrict this to propositional logic),
* formula_46, and formula_47 are finite (possibly empty) sequences of formulas (in fact, the order of formulas does not matter; see ), called contexts,
** when on the &quot;left&quot; of the formula_7, the sequence of formulas is considered &quot;conjunctively&quot; (all assumed to hold at the same time),
** while on the &quot;right&quot; of the formula_7, the sequence of formulas is considered &quot;disjunctively&quot; (at least one of the formulas must hold for any assignment of variables),
* formula_50 denotes an arbitrary term,
* formula_51 and formula_52 denote variables.
* a variable is said to occur free within a formula if it is not bound by quantifiers formula_53 or formula_54.
* formula_55 denotes the formula that is obtained by substituting the term formula_50 for every free occurrence of the variable formula_51 in formula formula_44 with the restriction that the term formula_50 must be free for the variable formula_51 in formula_44 (i.e., no occurrence of any variable in formula_50 becomes bound in formula_55).
* formula_64, formula_65, formula_66, formula_67, formula_68, formula_69: These six stand for the two versions of each of three structural rules; one for use on the left (&#x27;L&#x27;) of a formula_7, and the other on its right (&#x27;R&#x27;). The rules are abbreviated &#x27;W&#x27; for &quot;Weakening (Left/Right)&quot;, &#x27;C&#x27; for &quot;Contraction&quot;, and &#x27;P&#x27; for &quot;Permutation&quot;.

Note that, contrary to the rules for proceeding along the reduction tree presented above, the following rules are for moving in the opposite directions, from axioms to theorems. Thus they are exact mirror-images of the rules above, except that here symmetry is not implicitly assumed, and rules regarding quantification are added.

&quot;Restrictions: In the rules formula_71 and formula_72, the variable formula_52 must not occur free anywhere in the respective lower sequents.&quot;

===An intuitive explanation===

The above rules can be divided into two major groups: &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;structural&quot; ones. Each of the logical rules introduces a new logical formula either on the left or on the right of the turnstile formula_7. In contrast, the structural rules operate on the structure of the sequents, ignoring the exact shape of the formulas. The two exceptions to this general scheme are the axiom of identity (I) and the rule of (Cut).

Although stated in a formal way, the above rules allow for a very intuitive reading in terms of classical logic. Consider, for example, the rule formula_75. It says that, whenever one can prove that formula_76 can be concluded from some sequence of formulas that contain formula_44, then one can also conclude formula_76 from the (stronger) assumption that formula_79 holds. Likewise, the rule formula_80 states that, if formula_81 and formula_44 suffice to conclude formula_76, then from formula_81 alone one can either still conclude formula_76 or formula_44 must be false, i.e. formula_87 holds. All the rules can be interpreted in this way.

For an intuition about the quantifier rules, consider the rule formula_71. Of course concluding that formula_89 holds just from the fact that formula_90 is true is not in general possible. If, however, the variable y is not mentioned elsewhere (i.e. it can still be chosen freely, without influencing the other formulas), then one may assume, that formula_90 holds for any value of y. The other rules should then be pretty straightforward.

Instead of viewing the rules as descriptions for legal derivations in predicate logic, one may also consider them as instructions for the construction of a proof for a given statement. In this case the rules can be read bottom-up; for example, formula_92 says that, to prove that formula_79 follows from the assumptions formula_81 and formula_95, it suffices to prove that formula_44 can be concluded from formula_81 and formula_1 can be concluded from formula_95, respectively. Note that, given some antecedent, it is not clear how this is to be split into formula_81 and formula_95. However, there are only finitely many possibilities to be checked since the antecedent by assumption is finite. This also illustrates how proof theory can be viewed as operating on proofs in a combinatorial fashion: given proofs for both formula_44 and formula_1, one can construct a proof for formula_79.

When looking for some proof, most of the rules offer more or less direct recipes of how to do this. The rule of cut is different: it states that, when a formula formula_44 can be concluded and this formula may also serve as a premise for concluding other statements, then the formula formula_44 can be &quot;cut out&quot; and the respective derivations are joined. When constructing a proof bottom-up, this creates the problem of guessing formula_44 (since it does not appear at all below). The cut-elimination theorem is thus crucial to the applications of sequent calculus in automated deduction: it states that all uses of the cut rule can be eliminated from a proof, implying that any provable sequent can be given a &quot;cut-free&quot; proof.

The second rule that is somewhat special is the axiom of identity (I). The intuitive reading of this is obvious: every formula proves itself. Like the cut rule, the axiom of identity is somewhat redundant: the completeness of atomic initial sequents states that the rule can be restricted to atomic formulas without any loss of provability.

Observe that all rules have mirror companions, except the ones for implication. This reflects the fact that the usual language of first-order logic does not include the &quot;is not implied by&quot; connective formula_108 that would be the De Morgan dual of implication. Adding such a connective with its natural rules would make the calculus completely left–right symmetric.

===Example derivations===

Here is the derivation of &quot;formula_109&quot;, known as
the &quot;Law of excluded middle&quot; (&quot;tertium non datur&quot; in Latin).
Next is the proof of a simple fact involving quantifiers. Note that the converse is not true, and its falsity can be seen when attempting to derive it bottom-up, because an existing free variable cannot be used in substitution in the rules formula_110 and formula_111.
For something more interesting we shall prove formula_112. It is straightforward to find the derivation, which exemplifies the usefulness of LK in automated proving.
These derivations also emphasize the strictly formal structure of the sequent calculus. For example, the logical rules as defined above always act on a formula immediately adjacent to the turnstile, such that the permutation rules are necessary. Note, however, that this is in part an artifact of the presentation, in the original style of Gentzen. A common simplification involves the use of multisets of formulas in the interpretation of the sequent, rather than sequences, eliminating the need for an explicit permutation rule. This corresponds to shifting commutativity of assumptions and derivations outside the sequent calculus, whereas LK embeds it within the system itself.

===Relation to analytic tableaux===
For certain formulations (i.e. variants) of the sequent calculus, a proof in such a calculus is isomorphic to an upside-down, closed analytic tableau.

===Structural rules===

The structural rules deserve some additional discussion.

Weakening (W) allows the addition of arbitrary elements to a sequence. Intuitively, this is allowed in the antecedent because we can always restrict the scope of our proof (if all cars have wheels, then it&#x27;s safe to say that all black cars have wheels); and in the succedent because we can always allow for alternative conclusions (if all cars have wheels, then it&#x27;s safe to say that all cars have either wheels or wings).

Contraction (C) and Permutation (P) assure that neither the order (P) nor the multiplicity of occurrences (C) of elements of the sequences matters. Thus, one could instead of sequences also consider sets.

The extra effort of using sequences, however, is justified since part or all of the structural rules may be omitted. Doing so, one obtains the so-called substructural logics.

===Properties of the system LK===

This system of rules can be shown to be both sound and complete with respect to first-order logic, i.e. a statement formula_44 follows semantically from a set of premises formula_81 formula_115 if and only if the sequent formula_116 can be derived by the above rules.

In the sequent calculus, the rule of cut is admissible. This result is also referred to as Gentzen&#x27;s &quot;Hauptsatz&quot; (&quot;Main Theorem&quot;).

==Variants==

The above rules can be modified in various ways:

===Minor structural alternatives===

There is some freedom of choice regarding the technical details of how sequents and structural rules are formalized without changing what sequents the system derives.

First of all, as mentioned above, the sequents can be viewed to consist of sets or multisets. In this case, the rules for permuting and (when using sets) contracting formulas are unnecessary.

The rule of weakening becomes admissible if the axiom (I) is changed to derive any sequent of the form formula_117. Any weakening that appears in a derivation can then be moved to the beginning of the proof. This may be a convenient change when constructing proofs bottom-up.

One may also change whether rules with more than one premise share the same context for each of those premises or split their contexts between them: For example, formula_118 may be instead formulated as

:formula_119

Contraction and weakening make this version of the rule interderivable with the version above, although in their absence, as in linear logic, these rules define different connectives.

===Absurdity===
One can introduce formula_120, the absurdity constant representing &quot;false&quot;, with the axiom:

:formula_121

Or if, as described above, weakening is to be an admissible rule, then with the axiom:

:formula_122

With formula_120, negation can be subsumed as a special case of implication, via the definition formula_124.

===Substructural logics===
Alternatively, one may restrict or forbid the use of some of the structural rules. This yields a variety of substructural logic systems. They are generally weaker than LK (&quot;i.e.&quot;, they have fewer theorems), and thus not complete with respect to the standard semantics of first-order logic. However, they have other interesting properties that have led to applications in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

===Intuitionistic sequent calculus: System LJ===

Surprisingly, some small changes in the rules of LK suffice to turn it into a proof system for intuitionistic logic. To this end, one has to restrict to sequents with at most one formula on the right-hand side, and modify the rules to maintain this invariant. For example, formula_118 is reformulated as follows (where C is an arbitrary formula):

:formula_126

The resulting system is called LJ. It is sound and complete with respect to intuitionistic logic and admits a similar cut-elimination proof. This can be used in proving disjunction and existence properties.

In fact, the only rules in LK that need to be restricted to single-formula consequents are formula_127, formula_128 (which can be seen as a special case of formula_129, as described above) and formula_71. When multi-formula consequents are interpreted as disjunctions, all of the other inference rules of LK are derivable in LJ, while the rules formula_127 and formula_71 become
:formula_133
and (when formula_52 does not occur free in the bottom sequent)
:formula_135

These rules are not intuitionistically valid.

<text>William Edward Cotton (6 May 1899 – 25 March 1969) was an English band leader and entertainer, one of the few whose orchestras survived the British dance band era. Cotton is now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s radio and television personality, but his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years, Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for Brentford (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a Gipsy Moth, which he piloted himself. His autobiography, &quot;I Did It My Way&quot;, was published in 1970, a year after his death.

==Life and career==
Born in Smith Square, Westminster, London, England, to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a drummer. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers by falsifying his age and saw service in the First World War in Malta and Egypt before landing at Gallipoli in the middle of an artillery barrage. He was recommended for a commission and learned to fly Bristol Fighter aircraft. Not yet 19 years old, he flew solo for the first time in 1918, on the day the Royal Flying Corps became the Royal Air Force. After the end of the war, in the early 1920s, he worked at several jobs, including as a bus driver, before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.

At first a conventional dance band, the London Savannah Band gradually tended towards music hall/vaudeville entertainment, introducing visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians who played in Billy Cotton&#x27;s band during the 1920s and 1930s included Arthur Rosebery, Syd Lipton and Nat Gonella. The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was &quot;Somebody Stole My Gal&quot;, and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.

During the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the &quot;Billy Cotton Band Show&quot;, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show. It regularly opened with the band&#x27;s signature tune and Cotton&#x27;s call of &quot;Wakey Wakey&quot;. From 1956, it was also broadcast on BBC television. Cotton often also provided vocals on many of his band&#x27;s recordings, in addition to work as a vocalist on recordings that did not feature his band.

As a racing driver, he raced at Brooklands between the wars. He finished fourth in the 1949 British Grand Prix, sharing an English Racing Automobiles car with David Hampshire.

==Personal life==
Cotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921. They had two sons, Ted and Bill Cotton, who later became the BBC&#x27;s managing director of television; despite this, he had an affair with one of his band&#x27;s singers (Doreen Stephans) and moved into a flat with her in the early 1950s. In 1962, Billy Cotton suffered a stroke. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at Wembley Arena.

Billy Cotton was the great-great-uncle of TV and radio presenter Fearne Cotton.

<text>Osceola (1804 – January 30, 1838, Vsse Yvholv in Creek, also spelled Asi-yahola), named Billy Powell at birth, was an influential leader of the Seminole people in Florida. His mother was Muscogee, and his great-grandfather was a Scotsman, James McQueen. He was reared by his mother in the Creek (Muscogee) tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other Red Stick refugees, led by a relative, Peter McQueen, after their group&#x27;s defeat in 1814 in the Creek Wars. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.

In 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the Second Seminole War, when the United States tried to remove the tribe from their lands in Florida to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. He became an adviser to Micanopy, the principal chief of the Seminole from 1825 to 1849. Osceola led the Seminole resistance to removal until he was captured on October 21, 1837, by deception, under a flag of truce, when he went to a site near Fort Peyton for peace talks. The United States first imprisoned him at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, then transported him to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina. He died there a few months later of causes reported as an internal infection or malaria. Because of his renown, Osceola attracted visitors in prison, including renowned artist George Catlin, who painted perhaps the most well-known portrait of the Seminole leader. 

== Early life ==
Osceola was named Billy Powell at his birth in 1804 in the Upper Creek village of Talisi, which means &quot;Old Town&quot;. The village site, now the city of Tallassee, Alabama, was located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The residents of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of several ethnicities. The Muscogee Creek were among the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands, and some of them held enslaved black people. Powell was believed to have ancestors from all of these groups. His mother was Polly Coppinger, a mixed-race Creek woman, and his father was most likely William Powell, a Scottish trader.

Polly was also of Muscogee and European ancestry, as the daughter of Ann McQueen and Jose Coppinger. Because the Muscogee had a matrilineal kinship system, Polly and Ann&#x27;s children were all born into their mother&#x27;s clan. They were reared by their mothers and their maternal male relatives following Muscogee cultural practices, and they gained their social status from their mother&#x27;s people. Ann McQueen was also mixed-race Muscogee Creek; her father, James McQueen, was Scottish. Ann was probably the sister or aunt of Peter McQueen, a prominent Muscogee leader and warrior. Like his mother, Billy Powell was raised in the Muscogee Creek confederacy.

Billy Powell&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James McQueen, was a ship-jumping Scottish sailor who in 1716 became the first recorded white person to trade with the Muscogee Creek Confederacy in Alabama. He stayed in the area as a fur trader and married into a Muscogee family, becoming closely involved with these people. He was buried in 1811 at the Indian cemetery in Franklin, Alabama, near a Methodist missionary church for the Muscogee.

In 1814, after the Red Stick Muscogee Creeks were defeated by United States forces, Polly took Osceola and moved with other Muscogee refugees from Alabama to Florida, where they joined the Seminole. In adulthood, as part of the Seminole, Powell was given his name &quot;Osceola&quot; ( or ). This is an anglicized form of the Creek &quot;Vsse Yvholv&quot; (pronounced ), a combination of &quot;vsse&quot;, the ceremonial black drink made from the yaupon holly, and &quot;yvholv&quot;, often translated &quot;shouter&quot; but referring specifically to the one who performs a special whoop at the Green Corn Ceremony or archaically to a tribal town officer responsible for offering the black drink.

In April 1818, during the First Seminole War, Osceola and his mother where living in Peter McQueen&#x27;s village near the Econfina River, when it was attacked and destroyed by the Lower Creek allies of U.S. General Andrew Jackson that were led by William McIntosh. Many surviving Red Stick warriors and their families, including McQueen, retreated south into the Florida peninsula.

In 1821, the United States acquired Florida from Spain (see the Adams-Onis Treaty), and more European-American settlers started moving in, encroaching on the Seminoles&#x27; territory. After early military skirmishes and the signing of the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, by which the U.S. seized the northern Seminole lands, Osceola and his family moved with the Seminole deeper into the unpopulated wilds of central and southern Florida.
As an adult, Osceola took two wives, as did some other high-ranking Muscogee and Seminole leaders. With them, he had at least five children. One of his wives was black, and Osceola fiercely opposed the enslavement of free people. Lt. John T. Sprague mentions in his 1848 history &quot;The Florida War&quot; that Osceola had a wife named &quot;Che-cho-ter&quot; (Morning Dew), who bore him four children.

== 1830s resistance and war leader ==
Through the 1820s and 1830s American settlers continued pressuring the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this. Donald L. Fixico, an American Indian historian, says he made a research trip to the National Archives to see the original Treaty of Fort Gibson (also known as the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing), and that upon close inspection, he observed that it had &quot;a small triangular hole shaped like the point of a knife blade.&quot;

Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden by law to carry arms.

Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson&#x27;s office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.

On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King. Americans called this event the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the Second Seminole War with the United States.

In April 1836, Osceola led a band of warriors in an attempt to expel U.S. forces from Fort Cooper. The fortification was built on the west bank of Lake Holathikaha as an outpost for actions against the local Seminole population. Despite running low on food, the U.S. garrison had enough gunpowder and ammunition to keep the Seminoles from taking the fort before reinforcements arrived.

== Capture and death ==
On October 21, 1837, Osceola and 81 of his followers were captured by General Joseph Hernández on the orders of General Thomas Jesup, under a white flag of truce, when they went for peace talks to Fort Peyton near St. Augustine. He was initially imprisoned at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, before being transferred to Fort Moultrie on Sullivans Island, outside Charleston, South Carolina. Osceola&#x27;s capture by deceit caused a national uproar. General Jesup&#x27;s treacherous act and the administration were condemned by many congressional leaders and vilified by international press. Jesup suffered a loss of reputation that lasted for the rest of his life; his betrayal of the truce flag has been described as &quot;one of the most disgraceful acts in American military history.&quot;

That December, Osceola and other Seminole prisoners were moved to Fort Moultrie. They were visited by various townspeople. The portraitists George Catlin, W. M. Laning, and Robert John Curtis, the three artists known to have painted Osceola from life, persuaded the Seminole leader to allow his portrait to be painted despite his being gravely ill. Osceola and Curtis developed a close friendship, conversing at length during the painting sessions; Curtis painted two oil portraits of Osceola, one of which remains in the Charleston Museum. These paintings have inspired numerous widely distributed prints and engravings, and cigar store figures were also based on them.

Osceola, having suffered from chronic malaria since 1836, and having acute tonsillitis as well, developed an abscess. When he was close to death, as his last wish he asked the attending doctor, Frederick Weedon, that his body be returned to Florida, his home, so that he might rest in peace. He died of quinsy on January 30, 1838, three months after his capture. Rather than honoring his last wish, Weedon cut off Osceola&#x27;s head and buried his decapitated body, displaying the Seminole leader&#x27;s head in his drug store. During the time Weedon had the head in his possession, he would often place it in the bedroom of his three sons as punishment for misbehavior. Weedon would later give the head to his son-in-law, Dr. Daniel Whitehurst, who gifted the head to Valentine Mott in 1843. Mott placed it in his Surgical and Pathological Museum, where it was presumed destroyed in a fire in 1866.

== Descendants ==
* Chairman Joe Dan Osceola (1936–2019), ambassador of the Seminole Tribe, was Osceola&#x27;s great-great-great grandson.

== Relics ==
According to the oral tradition of his descendants, Dr. Frederick Weedon was alone with the body and cut off Osceola&#x27;s head, placing it in the coffin with the scarf that Osceola had customarily worn being wrapped around the neck, and immediately before the funeral ceremony removed the head and shut the coffin&#x27;s lid. Weedon kept the head for himself, as well as other objects belonging to Osceola, including a brass pipe and a silver concho. Capt. Pitcairn Morrison, the U.S. Army officer in charge of the Seminole prisoners who had been transported with Osceola, made a last-minute decision to take other items belonging to Osceola. The historical evidence suggests that it was Morrison who decided that a death mask should be made, a European-American custom at the time for prominent persons, but it was done without the permission of Osceola&#x27;s people. An acquaintance of Morrison, Dr. Benjamin Strobel, a native of Charleston, made a plaster cast of Osceola&#x27;s face and upper torso. The process of &quot;pulling&quot; the first mold, which was soon displayed in the window of a Charleston drugstore, destroyed the original cast. Weedon apparently preserved Osceola&#x27;s head in a large jar of alcohol and took it to St. Augustine, where he exhibited it in the family drugstore.

Captain Pitcairn Morrison sent the death mask and some other objects collected by Weedon to an army officer in Washington. By 1885, the death mask and some of Osceola&#x27;s belongings were being held in the anthropology collection of the Smithsonian Institution. The death mask is currently housed in the Luce collection of the New-York Historical Society.

In 1966, Miami businessman Otis W. Shriver claimed he had dug up Osceola&#x27;s grave and put his bones into a bank vault to rebury them at a tourist site at the Rainbow Springs in Marion County. Shriver traveled around the state in 1967 to gather support for his project. Archaeologists later proved that Shriver had dug up animal remains; Osceola&#x27;s body was still in its coffin.

In 1979, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma bought Osceola&#x27;s bandolier and other personal items from a Sotheby&#x27;s auction. Because of the chief&#x27;s significance, over time some people have created forgeries of Osceola&#x27;s belongings. Rumors persist that his embalmed head has been found in various locations.

<text>() is a common Norwegian name for &#x27; (; ; ; ; &quot;/&quot;), a family of soft cheese-related foods made with whey, milk, and/or cream. The characteristic brown color and sweet taste result from milk sugars being caramelized after boiling. The term is often used to refer to &#x27; or  (&#x27;Gudbrandsdal cheese&#x27;), which are the most popular varieties. 

 is primarily produced in Norway and is popular there, and has spread to South Korea. It is regarded as one of Norway&#x27;s most iconic foodstuffs, and is considered an important part of the country&#x27;s gastronomical and cultural identity and heritage.

==History==
Boiling down whey 10:1 to create a brown, cheesy spread (such as the Norwegian and Swedish ) has been common in the Scandinavian countries for at least 2,500 years. An archeological find from September 2016 in central Jutland has determined that a cheese residue on pottery from circa 650 B.C.E. is a type of cheese, potentially similar to .

However, the creation of the modern, firm, fatty is commonly attributed to the milkmaid Anne Hov from the rural valley of Gudbrandsdalen. In the second half of the 19th century, Gudbrandsdalen was suffering economically due to falling profits from grain and butter sales. While working at the Valseter mountain farm near Gålå in 1863, Anne Hov (sometimes spelled Anne Haav) came up with the idea of adding cream to the whey when boiling, and to boil it down in an iron pot until the fluid content was reduced to less than 80 percent, creating a firmer, fattier, more cheese-like product. She originally called it (&#x27;fat cheese&#x27;). The name later changed into (&#x27;cream whey cheese&#x27;). The product immediately caught on, and was soon commonly produced and consumed in the area. This variety is currently the second most popular type in Norway. In 1805, Ole Olsen Evenstad, from what is now Stor-Elvdal Municipality, wrote his cheese manuscript, , but Evenstad does not mention goat&#x27;s milk or cream as an additive. 

When Hov married and moved to Rusthågå farm in Nord-Fron Municipality, she started larger-scale production and invented a variety where she added goat&#x27;s milk to the mix for a more pronounced taste. The local trader Ole Kongsli liked it so much he thought there might be a market for the product in the capital, Oslo. He started exporting it to his business contacts in Oslo under the name (), and it became so successful that it contributed significantly to the economy of the region, thus helping Gudbrandsdalen out of recession. In 1933, at age 87, Hov received the King&#x27;s Medal of Merit () for her contributions to Norwegian cuisine and economy.

In modern times, the world&#x27;s largest producer of is the Norwegian dairy co-operative Tine, which markets a total of 13 varieties, as well as three types of . The second-largest is Norwegian dairy company Synnøve Finden, which markets two varieties of , as well as two varieties of . There are also a number of smaller, artisanal producers, mainly in Norway and in the US. 
==Description==
 is a family of cheese-related foods made with whey and milk and/or cream. The main ingredient, whey, is a of the cheese making process; it is what is left when the cheese is removed from the milk. Therefore, is not technically cheese. However, it is produced by cheese makers, and is sold, handled and consumed in the same way as cheese. Therefore, it is generally regarded as a cheese. The texture is firm, but slightly softer than Gouda cheese, for example, and lends itself well to cutting and shaping. It does not crumble like hard cheeses. The taste is sweet, and best described as caramel-like, but with a tang that is more noticeable in the variants that contain goat&#x27;s milk. The variant (&#x27;true goat&#x27;s cheese&#x27;) contains only whey and goat&#x27;s milk, and has an intense, chèvre-like taste that cuts the sweetness.

==Production==
 is made by boiling a mixture of milk, cream, and whey carefully for several hours so that the water evaporates. The heat turns the milk sugars into caramel, which gives the cheese its characteristic brown colour and sweetness. It is ready for consumption as soon as it is packed and refrigerated. Low-fat varieties are made by increasing the proportion of whey to milk and cream.

==Varieties==

In Norway, is commonly divided into two types: those that contain only cow&#x27;s cream and/or milk, and the ones that contain some proportion of goat&#x27;s milk. The latter type is commonly called or (&#x27;goat cheese&#x27;). Varieties that do not contain any cow&#x27;s milk are called (&#x27;true goat cheese&#x27;). Technically, the name &#x27;true goat cheese&#x27; is misleading, since goat cheese (such as the French chèvre) is relatively uncommon in Norway, and is commonly called (&#x27;white goat cheese&#x27;) to avoid confusion.

By far the most popular variety is , which contains a mixture of cow and goat milk, cream, and whey. Heidal cheese is a type of &#x27;. In Norway it is so common that it is simply referred to as or , assuming that unless otherwise specified, &#x27; will be provided. This variety is also the most popular internationally, and in the US it is commonly referred to just as . The second most popular variety is , which has a milder taste due to the lack of goat&#x27;s milk. The third most popular type is .

Related to are (in Norwegian) or (in Swedish), which is a soft, sweet spread commonly sold in tubes all across the Nordic countries. This is the original, ancient product made by boiling whey for a shorter period of time than , and not adding milk or cream. Also, in Norway, is traditionally made from byproducts of the -making process, and has a very distinctive flavour.

Very similar to full cow&#x27;s milk , but unrelated to it (probably developed independently) is , from the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. It is produced in a similar way, by boiling cow&#x27;s milk until it caramelises and darkens to a brown colour, hence the name &#x27;tanned, brown&#x27;. has three varieties: &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;with scrapes&#x27; (because of the streaks of caramelised milk scraped from the pan), and . The flavour and texture of the latter have a remarkable resemblance to brunost.

==Use==
 is mostly used as a topping for sandwiches, crispbread, and biscuits. It is very common in the traditional Norwegian (), which is a common Norwegian lunch—sandwiches are packed in a lunch box in the morning, and carried to work for consumption in the 30-minute lunch break commonly afforded to Norwegian workers. One advantage of for this purpose is that although its texture changes if not refrigerated, its taste does not. is also popular on Norwegian waffles, and as an ingredient in cooking, particularly in gravy for game meat.

==Nutrition==
To what extent is healthy has been the subject of some controversy in Norway. On the one hand, contains high amounts of calcium, proteins and vitamin B, as well as iodine, which is beneficial. It also does not, as other cheeses do, contain salt. It used to contain significant amounts of iron because it was traditionally made in iron pots. In fact, when modern production methods with aluminium pans were introduced by the Norwegian dairy co-operative, the government was worried that it would significantly reduce iron intake in the general population, and ordered iron to be added to the cheese. On 1 September 2001, however, a ban on the addition of iron to was introduced. A few years later, exceptions to the ban were introduced after health authorities identified an increasing incidence of iron deficiency in younger age groups. Modern does not contain significant amounts of iron.

On the other hand, the (natural) sugar content of is quite high, and also the fat content is significant, causing some to warn against it, and even likening it to milk chocolate. Some tests have shown major nutritional differences between different varieties of . Also, it has been pointed out by nutrition experts that the fat content of most is significantly lower than that of numerous other cheeses, such as soft cheeses.

Where many sorts of cheese are naturally lactose free, brunost is high in lactose.

==Brattli tunnel fire==
In January 2013, a lorry caught fire in the long Brattli tunnel in Tysfjord Municipality. The temperature of the burning lorry rose so high that the of it was carrying caught fire also. Its fats and sugars fueled the blaze and prevented firefighters from approaching it until four days later when most of it had burned out. The tunnel was severely damaged, and was closed for repair for several months afterward. The accident was widely publicized in international media, and was dubbed &quot;the goat cheese fire&quot;. It was likened to the 1999 Mont Blanc tunnel fire, when a truck carrying margarine and flour caught fire.

<text>Aristippus of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (; ; c. 435 – c. 356 BCE) was a hedonistic Greek philosopher and the founder of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy. He was a pupil of Socrates, but adopted a different philosophical outlook, teaching that the goal of life was to seek pleasure by adapting circumstances to oneself and by maintaining proper control over both adversity and prosperity. His view that pleasure is the only good came to be called ethical hedonism. Due to the ideological and philosophical differences between Socrates and himself, Aristippus faced backlash by Socrates and many of his fellow-pupils. Out of his hedonistic beliefs, Aristippus&#x27; most famous phrase was, &quot;I possess, I am not possessed.&quot; Despite having two sons, Aristippus identified his daughter Arete as the &quot;intellectual heiress&quot; of his work, resulting in the systematization of his work and the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, by Arete, and her son Aristippus the Younger, Aristippus&#x27; grandson, during the later years of his life and after his death.

There are indications that Aristippus was conflated with his grandson, Aristippus the Younger.

== Life ==
Aristippus, the son of Aritades, was born in Cyrene, Ancient Libya, c. 435 BCE. Having come to Greece to attend the Olympic games, he met and asked Ischomachus about Socrates, resulting in a strong desire to see Socrates, after hearing of his description. Seeking Socrates, he went to Athens and made him his master.

Though a disciple of Socrates, Aristippus wandered both in principle and practice from the teaching and example of his master. After learning the philosophical views and values of Socrates, Aristippus formed a greater interest in pleasure, eventually leading him to popularize and focus more solely on ethical hedonism. Due to his philosophical differences from Socrates, Aristippus sought other avenues, leading him towards the court of Dionysius I of Syracuse or Dionysius the Younger. At the court Aristippus became a counselor, and continued to seek his pleasures. While there he lived luxuriously and sought sensual gratification and the company of the notorious Lais. Additionally, Aristippus was the first of Socrates&#x27; disciples to make money for his teaching, which on occasion he sent to Socrates, although often returned to him, due to Socrates viewing it as an insult. Aristippus also said that he resided in a foreign land in order to escape the trouble of involving himself in the politics of his native city, to Socrates.

Due to his lifelong pursuit of pleasure and philosophical teachings on pleasure, against the teachings of Socrates, Aristippus garnered conflict between philosophers like Socrates and his fellow-pupils over the course of his life. He is also said to have been taken prisoner by Artaphernes, the satrap who drove the Spartans from Rhodes in 396. Despite the backlash he received for his philosophical views, teachings and lifestyle, Aristippus continued his spread of ethical hedonism by imparting his doctrine to his daughter Arete who, in turn, imparted it to her son, Aristippus the Younger, who is said to have reduced it to a system in the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, that Aristippus helped found. In old age, Aristippus is said to have returned to Cyrene, living out his retirement in luxury and in the pursuit of pleasure till his death, at the age of 79.

In Book VI of &quot;De architectura&quot;, Vitruvius describes Aristippus:
It is related of the Socratic philosopher Aristippus that, being shipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast of the Rhodians, he observed geometrical figures drawn thereon, and cried out to his companions: &quot;Let us be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man.&quot; With that he made for the city of Rhodes, and went straight to the gymnasium. There he fell to discussing philosophical subjects, and presents were bestowed upon him, so that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those who accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life. When his companions wished to return to their country, and asked him what message he wished them to carry home, he bade them say this: that children ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that could swim with them even out of a shipwreck.

==Philosophy==

Aristippus&#x27; philosophies centered around hedonism. Having been a pupil of Socrates, Aristippus recognized Socrates&#x27; enjoyment of things like parties, the drinking of wine and accepting gifts. Intrigued by such acts, Aristippus eventually formed the philosophy of ethical hedonism. Aristippus viewed pleasure and the pursuit of pleasure as life&#x27;s supreme good, as well as valued the importance of not becoming possessed or enslaved by such pleasurable acts and objects. By way of his philosophy, Aristippus&#x27; famous phrase, &quot;I possess, I am not possessed,&quot; emerged. Having stressed his beliefs, Aristippus admonished his followers to never harm others, and cautioned that the pursuit of pleasure ought to be moderated by moral self-restraint. After forming his philosophy, Aristippus started the Cyrenaic school of philosophy where his philosophical principles would be taught, further structured, and turned into a comprehensive system by his daughter, Arete, and his grandson, Aristippus the Younger.

Despite Aristippus&#x27; bringing attention to the value of pursuing pleasure albeit in moderation, Aristippus&#x27; hedonistic philosophy often received backlash by Socrates and his fellow-pupils. While Socrates did indulge in such activities like parties, drinking wine and accepting gifts, Socrates viewed virtue as more valuable than pleasure. Since Aristippus valued pleasure more than Socrates did and found less intrinsic value in virtue, other philosophers, like Plato and Xenophon, supported as well as initiated the accusation that Aristippus had defied and had strayed from Socrates&#x27; philosophical teachings. Aristotle is also noted for calling him a sophist. Due to the differences in philosophical values and beliefs, Aristippus and his hedonistic philosophy separated him from Socrates as well as from other prominent philosophers at that time. One notable example of philosophers demonstrating disdain for Aristippus&#x27; values is in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo,&quot; where Plato describes Aristippus having been at Aegina, a pleasure resort, rather attending as a witness of Socrates&#x27; death.

Of the anecdotes that survive about Aristippus, those from Diogenes Laërtius are the most abundant. Diogenes asserts, for example, that to observe the precepts of Aristippus is &quot;to endeavor to adapt circumstances to myself, not myself to circumstances&quot; and that, &quot;every complexion of life, every station and circumstance sat gracefully upon him.&quot; Another such report is of Aristippus being reproached for his love of bodily indulgences, to which Aristippus is said to have answered, &quot;It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but mastery over them without ever being worsted.&quot;

==Works==
None of Aristippus&#x27;s works are extant. Diogenes Laërtius, on the authority of Sotion and Panaetius, gives a long list of books whose authorship is ascribed to Aristippus, though he also states that according to Sosicrates of Rhodes, Aristippus never wrote anything. Some letters attributed to him are said by some to be forgeries.

One work attributed to Aristippus in ancient times was a book entitled &quot;On Ancient Luxury&quot; (or &quot;On the Luxury of the Ancients&quot;; ); although it has long been considered that this work could not have been written by Aristippus of Cyrene, not least because the author mentions Theophrastus, who lived a generation after Aristippus. The name may have been adopted by the writer to suggest a connection with the hedonistic philosopher. This work, judging by the quotations preserved by Diogenes Laërtius, has also been presumed to have been filled with anecdotes about philosophers and their supposed taste for courtesans or boys.

<doc id="252344" wikidata="Q1195523" url="?curid=252344" title="Henry James Sumner Maine">
<text>Sir Henry James Sumner Maine, (15 August 1822 – 3 February 1888), was a British Whig comparative jurist and historian. He is famous for the thesis outlined in his book &quot;Ancient Law&quot; that law and society developed &quot;from status to contract.&quot; According to the thesis, in the ancient world individuals were tightly bound by status dealing with(in) a particular group while in the modern one, in which individuals are viewed as autonomous agents, they are free to make contracts and form associations with whomever they choose. Because of this thesis, Maine can be seen as one of the forefathers of modern legal anthropology, legal history and sociology of law.

==Early life==
Maine was the son of Dr. James Maine, of Kelso, Roxburghshire. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, where a boarding house was named after him in 1902, being the 7th block on the avenue, and 3rd on the East Side. From there he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1840. At Cambridge, he was noted as a classical scholar and also won the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for poetry in 1842. He won a Craven scholarship and graduated as senior classic in 1844, being also senior chancellor&#x27;s medallist in classics. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

Shortly afterwards, he accepted a tutorship at Trinity Hall. In 1847, he was appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law, and he was called to the bar three years later; he held this chair until 1854. Meanwhile, in 1852 he had become one of the readers appointed by the Inns of Court.

==In India==
The post of legal member of council in India was offered to Maine in 1861; he declined it once, on grounds of health. The following year Maine was persuaded to accept, and it turned out that India suited him much better than Cambridge or London. He was asked to prolong his services beyond the regular term of five years, and he returned to England in 1869.

The subjects on which it was Maine&#x27;s duty to advise the government of India were as much political as legal. They ranged from such problems as the land settlement of the Punjab, or the introduction of civil marriage to provide for the needs of unorthodox Hindus, to the question of how far the study of Persian should be required or encouraged among European civil servants. Plans of codification were prepared, and largely shaped, under Maine&#x27;s direction, which were implemented by his successors, Sir James Fitzjames Stephen and Dr Whitley Stokes.

Maine became a member of the Secretary of State&#x27;s council in 1871 and remained so for the rest of his life. In the same year he was gazetted a K.C.S.I.

==Oxford professor==
In 1869, Maine was appointed to the chair of historical and comparative jurisprudence newly founded in the University of Oxford by Corpus Christi College. Residence at Oxford was not required, and the election amounted to an invitation to the new professor to resume and continue in his own way the work he had begun in &quot;Ancient Law&quot;.

In 1877, the mastership of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where Maine had formerly been tutor, became vacant. There were two strong candidates whose claims were so nearly equal that it was difficult to elect either; the difficulty was solved by a unanimous invitation to Maine to accept the post. His acceptance entailed the resignation of the Oxford chair, though not continuous residence at Cambridge. Ten years later, he was elected to succeed Sir William Harcourt as Whewell Professor of International Law at Cambridge.

In 1886, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

==Death==
Maine&#x27;s health, which had never been strong, gave way towards the end of 1887. He went to the Riviera under medical advice, and died at Cannes, France, on 3 February 1888. He left a wife, Jane, and two sons, of whom the elder died soon afterwards. An oil portrait of Jane remains in the possession of their descendants.

==Works==

Maine wrote journalism in 1851 for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, edited by John Douglas Cook. With Cook and others, in 1855, he then founded and edited the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, writing for it to 1861. Like his close friend James Fitzjames Stephen, he enjoyed occasional article-writing, and never quite abandoned it.

Maine contributed to the &quot;Cambridge Essays&quot; an essay on Roman law and legal education, republished in the later editions of &quot;Village Communities&quot;. Lectures delivered by Maine for the Inns of Court were the groundwork of &quot;Ancient Law&quot; (1861), the book by which his reputation was made at one stroke. Its object, as stated in the preface, was &quot;to indicate some of the earliest ideas of mankind, as they are reflected in ancient law, and to point out the relation of those ideas to modern thought.&quot; He published the substance of his Oxford lectures: &quot;Village Communities in the East and the West&quot; (1871); &quot;Early History of Institutions&quot; (1875); &quot;Early Law and Custom&quot; (1883). In all these works, the phenomena of societies in an archaic stage are brought into line to illustrate the process of development in legal and political ideas (see freedom of contract).

As vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, Maine commented on the results produced by the contact of Eastern and Western thought. Three of these addresses were published, wholly or in part, in the later editions of &quot;Village Communities&quot;; the substance of others is in the Rede lecture of 1875, in the same volume. An essay on India was his contribution to the composite work entitled &quot;The Reign of Queen Victoria&quot; (editor Thomas Humphry Ward, 1887).

His brief work in international law is represented by the posthumous volume &quot;International Law&quot; (1888). Maine had published in 1885 his one work of speculative politics, a volume of essays on &quot;Popular Government&quot;, designed to show that democracy is not in itself more stable than any other form of government and that there is no necessary connexion between democracy and progress.

In 1886, there appeared in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; an article on the posthumous work of J. F. McLennan, edited and completed by his brother, entitled &quot;The Patriarchal Theory&quot;. The article, though unsigned by the rule of the &quot;Quarterly&quot; at the time, was Maine&#x27;s reply to the McLennan brothers&#x27; attack on the historical reconstruction of the Indo-European family system put forward in &quot;Ancient Law&quot; and supplemented in &quot;Early Law and Custom&quot;. Maine charged McLennan in his theory of primitive society with neglecting and misunderstanding of the Indo-European evidence.

A summary of Maine&#x27;s writings was in Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff&#x27;s memoir.

<doc id="252345" wikidata="Q31491" url="?curid=252345" title="Tiberius II Constantine">
<text>Tiberius II Constantine (; ; died 14 August 582) was Eastern Roman emperor from 574 to 582. Tiberius rose to power in 574 when Justin II, prior to a mental breakdown, proclaimed him &quot;caesar&quot; and adopted him as his own son. In 578, the dying Justin II gave him the title of &quot;augustus&quot;, thus becoming co-emperor alongside him. Tiberius became sole ruler less than two weeks later, assuming the regnal name of &quot;Constantine&quot; under which he reigned until his death.

==Early career==
Born in Thrace in the mid-6th century, Tiberius was appointed to the post of notarius. There, sometime after 552, he was introduced by the Patriarch Eutychius to the future emperor, Justin II, with whom he became firm friends. Under Justin&#x27;s patronage, Tiberius was promoted to the position of &quot;Comes excubitorum&quot;, which he held from approximately 565 through to 574. He was present during Justin&#x27;s imperial accession on 14 November 565 and also attended his inauguration as consul on 1 January 566.

Justin ceased making payments to the Avars, which had been implemented by his predecessor, Justinian. In 569, he appointed Tiberius to the post of &quot;Magister utriusque militiae&quot;, with instructions to deal with the Avars and their demands. After a series of negotiations, Tiberius agreed to allow the Avars to settle on Roman territory in the Balkans, in exchange for male hostages taken from various Avar chiefs. Justin, however, rejected the agreement, insisting on taking hostages from the family of the Avar Khan himself. That condition was rejected by the Avars and so Tiberius mobilized for war.

==Avar War of 570==
In 570, he defeated an Avar army in Thrace and returned to Constantinople. While attempting to follow up that victory in late 570 or early 571, Tiberius was defeated in a battle in the Danube regions in which he narrowly escaped death, as his army was fleeing the battlefield. Agreeing to a truce, Tiberius provided an escort to the Avar envoys to discuss the terms of a treaty with Justin. On their return, the Avar envoys were attacked and robbed by local tribesmen, prompting them to appeal to Tiberius for help. He tracked down the group responsible and returned the stolen goods.

In 574, Justin had a mental breakdown, forcing Empress Sophia to turn to Tiberius to manage the empire, which was fighting the Persians to the east and dealing with the internal crisis of the plague. To achieve a measure of breathing space, Tiberius and Sophia agreed to a one-year truce with the Persians, at the cost of 45,000 solidi. On 7 December 574, Justin, in one of his more lucid moments, had Tiberius proclaimed Caesar and adopted him as his own son. Tiberius added the name Constantine to his own. Although his position was now official, he was still subordinate to Justin. Sophia was determined to remain in power and kept Tiberius tightly controlled until Justin died, in 578.

==Elevation as &quot;caesar&quot; (574–578)==
The day after his appointment as Caesar, the plague abated, giving Tiberius more freedom of movement than Justin had been able to achieve. Tiberius also charted a very different course from his predecessor and proceeded to spend the money that Justin had doggedly saved in order to defend the imperial frontiers and win over the populace who had turned against him. According to Gregory of Tours, who was based in Merovingian Gaul, Tiberius found two treasures: the treasure of Narses and 1,000 &quot;centenaria&quot;: 100,000 pounds of gold or 7,200,000 solidi (&quot;nomismata&quot;), under a slab. The treasures were given away to the poor, to the consternation of Sophia. John of Ephesus, a contemporary East Roman, wrote that Tiberius lavishly gave presents to &quot;all men&quot; and later as emperor, tended to give money away to the rich and did nothing for the poor. During his time as &quot;caesar&quot;, his spending was opposed by Justin and Sophia, who set a ceiling for his expenditure and restricted his access to the treasury.

Alongside generous donations, he also proceeded to reduce state revenue by removing taxes on wine and bread instituted by Justinian I. He continued the official ban on the sale of governorships, which was highly popular. He also negotiated a truce with the Avars, paying them 80,000 solidi per year for which the Avars agreed to defend the Danube frontier, thereby allowing Tiberius to transfer troops across to the east for a planned renewal of the conflict against the Persians.

In 575, Tiberius began moving the armies of Thrace and Illyricum to the eastern provinces. Buying time to make the necessary preparations, he agreed to an additional truce with the Persians for three years, paying 30,000 solidi annually, though the truce excluded the wars in Armenia. Not content with making preparations, Tiberius also used this period to send reinforcements to Italy under the command of Baduarius with orders to stem the Lombard invasion. He saved Rome from the Lombards and allied the Empire with Childebert II, the King of the Franks, to defeat them. Unfortunately, Baduarius was defeated and killed in 576, allowing even more imperial territory in Italy to slip away. Tiberius was unable to respond as the Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I struck at the empire&#x27;s Armenian provinces in 576, sacking Melitene and Sebastea. Shifting his attention eastward, Tiberius sent his general Justinian with the eastern armies to push Khosrau and the Persians back across the Euphrates. The Byzantines led by Justinian pushed deep into Persian territory, culminating in a raid on Atropatene. In 577, however, Justinian was defeated in Persian Armenia, forcing a Byzantine withdrawal. In response to that defeat, Tiberius replaced Justinian with the future emperor Maurice. During the truce that Tiberius concluded with Khosrau, he busily enhanced the army of the east not only with transfers from his western armies but also through barbarian recruits, which he formed into a new foederati unit, amounting to some 15,000 troops by the end of his reign.

Throughout 577 and into 578, Tiberius avoided all other entanglements that would have distracted him from the approaching Persian conflict. He appeased, quite successfully, both Chalcedonian and Monophysite Christians by the use of strategic appointments and the easing of persecutions. He paid the Lombard tribal chieftains some 200,000 nomismata in an attempt to keep them divided and to prevent the election of a king. When the Slavs invaded Illyricum, he transported Avar armies to attack them and force their retreat. Consequently, when Khosrau invaded Roman Mesopotamia in 578, his general, Maurice, was able to invade Persian Arzanene and Mesopotamia, sacking a number of key towns and forcing the Persians to abandon their advance and defend their own territory. It was during that period that the ailing emperor, Justin, finally died on 5 October 578.

==Reign as &quot;augustus&quot; (578–582)==

On 26 September 578, Tiberius was made Augustus by the rapidly failing Justin. He used that opportunity to give away 7,200 pounds of gold, a practice that he continued annually throughout the four years of his reign.

Sophia, Justin&#x27;s widow, tried to maintain her power and influence by marrying the new emperor, but he refused her proposal because he was already married to Ino. When Tiberius had first been raised to the rank of Caesar, Sophia had refused the request for Ino and her children to move into the Imperial palace with her husband, forcing them to reside in a small residence nearby and prohibiting them from entering the palace. Once Tiberius was elevated to the rank of Augustus, however, he had his family moved into the palace and renamed Ino as Anastasia, much to Sophia&#x27;s resentment. Therefore, Sophia sought revenge, and a secret pact was made between the dowager empress and general Justinian, whom Tiberius had replaced the year before. They conspired to overthrow the emperor and seat Justinian in his place. The conspiracy failed, however, and Sophia was reduced to a modest allowance; Justinian was forgiven by Tiberius.

The ongoing success against the Persians in the East once again allowed Tiberius to turn his gaze westward. In 579, he again extended his military activities into the remnants of the Western Roman Empire. He sent money and troops to Italy to reinforce Ravenna and to retake the port of Classis. He formed an alliance with one of the Visigothic princes in Spain, who was fomenting rebellion, and his general Gennadius defeated the rebellious Berbers under their king Garmul in North Africa. He also intervened in Frankish affairs in the former province of Gaul, which had been largely free of imperial contacts for close to a century. Consequently, he might have been the basis for the fictional emperor Lucius Tiberius of Arthurian legend, who sent envoys to former Roman provinces after a long period without an imperial presence.

It has been argued that the empire was seriously overextended. In 579, with Tiberius occupied elsewhere, the Avars decided to take advantage of the lack of troops in the Balkans by besieging Sirmium. At the same time, the Slavs began to migrate into Thrace, Macedonia and southern Greece, which Tiberius was unable to halt as the Persians refused to agree to a peace in the east, which remained the emperor&#x27;s main priority. Furthermore, the army of the East was beginning to become restless, as it had not been paid, and it threatened to mutiny.

In 580, general Maurice launched a new offensive, raiding well beyond the Tigris. The following year, he again invaded Persian Armenia and almost succeeded in reaching the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, before a Persian counterinvasion of Byzantine Mesopotamia forced him to withdraw in order to deal with that threat. By 582, with no apparent end to the Persian war in sight, Tiberius was forced to come to terms with the Avars, and he agreed to pay an indemnity and to hand over the vital city of Sirmium, which the Avars then looted. The migration of the Slavs continued, with their incursions reaching as far south as Athens. Although a new Persian invasion was halted with a significant defeat at Constantina in June 582, by now, Tiberius was dying, apparently having eaten some poorly prepared food.

In this state, Tiberius initially named two heirs, each of whom married one of his daughters. Maurice was betrothed to Constantina, and Germanus, related to emperor Justinian, was married to Charito. Some historians believe that his plan was to divide the empire in two, with Maurice receiving the eastern provinces and Germanus the western provinces. This plan was never implemented. On 11 August 582, only Maurice is recorded as &quot;Caesar&quot; in the subscription of a law of Tiberius, and on 13 August 582, Tiberius elevated Maurice to the rank of Augustus.

Tiberius died on the following day, 14 August 582.

==Legacy==

A native of the Latin-speaking part of Thrace, Tiberius reportedly was tall and handsome, with a regal bearing. He was gentle and humane, both as a man and a ruler, with a reputation for generosity. Unlike his predecessor, he largely refrained from persecuting his Monophysite subjects, but his Arian subjects in the west did not fare as well. He also spent a good deal of money on building projects, most notably the continued expansion of the Great Palace of Constantinople.

In the 18th century, Edward Gibbon assessed Tiberius II as a good emperor who benevolently distributed wealth to the population.

That opinion was not shared by John Bagnall Bury in the 19th century, who criticized Tiberius as fiscally irresponsible.

== Family ==
Originally betrothed as a young man to the daughter of Ino, Tiberius eventually married Ino after her daughter and husband died. She took on the name &quot;Anastasia&quot; in 578 after his accession to the throne.

They had three children together, one of whom died before Tiberius was created Caesar in 574. Of his other two, both daughters, Constantina was married to Tiberius&#x27;s successor, Maurice, and Charito was married to Germanus. His wife and two daughters all outlived him.

<doc id="252348" wikidata="Q1279134" url="?curid=252348" title="Whitley Stokes (Celtic scholar)">
<text>Whitley Stokes, CSI, CIE, FBA (28 February 1830 – 13 April 1909) was an Irish lawyer and Celtic scholar.

==Background==
He was a son of William Stokes (1804–1878), and a grandson of Whitley Stokes the physician and anti-Malthusian (1763–1845), each of whom was Regius Professor of Physic at Trinity College Dublin. His sister Margaret Stokes was a writer and archaeologist.

He was born at 5 Merrion Square, Dublin and educated at St Columba&#x27;s College where he was taught Irish by Denis Coffey, author of a &quot;Primer of the Irish Language&quot;. Through his father he came to know the Irish antiquaries Samuel Ferguson, Eugene O&#x27;Curry, John O&#x27;Donovan and George Petrie. He entered Trinity College Dublin in 1846 and graduated with a BA in 1851. His friend and contemporary Rudolf Thomas Siegfried (1830–1863) became assistant librarian in Trinity College in 1855, and the college&#x27;s first professor of Sanskrit in 1858. It is likely that Stokes learnt both Sanskrit and comparative philology from Siegfried, thus acquiring a skill-set rare among Celtic scholars in Ireland at the time.

==Career==

Stokes qualified for the bar at Inner Temple. His instructors in the law were Arthur Cayley, Hugh McCalmont Hughes, and Thomas Chitty. Stokes became an English barrister on 17 November 1855, practicing in London before going to India in 1862, where he filled several official positions. In 1865 he married Mary Bazely by whom he had four sons and two daughters. One of his daughters, Maïve, compiled a book of &quot;Indian Fairy Tales&quot; in 1879 (she was 12 years old) based on stories told to her by her Indian &quot;ayahs&quot; and a man-servant. It also included some notes by Mrs. Mary Stokes. Mary died while the family was still living in India. In 1877, Stokes was appointed legal member of the viceroy&#x27;s council, and he drafted the codes of civil and criminal procedure and did much other valuable work of the same nature. In 1879 he became president of the commission on Indian law. Nine books by Stokes on Celtic studies were published in India. He returned to settle permanently in London in 1881 and married Elizabeth Temple in 1884. In 1887 he was made a CSI, and two years later a CIE He was an original fellow of the British Academy, an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and foreign associate of the Institut de France.

==Celtic scholarship==
Whitley Stokes is perhaps most famous as a Celtic scholar, and in this field he worked both in India and in England. He studied Irish, Breton and Cornish texts. His chief interest in Irish was as a source of material for comparative philology. Despite his learning in Old Irish and Middle Irish, he never acquired Irish pronunciation and never mastered Modern Irish. In the hundred years since his death he has continued to be a central figure in Celtic scholarship. Many of his editions have not been superseded in that time and his total output in Celtic studies comes to over 15,000 pages. He was a correspondent and close friend of Kuno Meyer from 1881 onwards. With Meyer he established the journal &quot;Archiv für celtische Lexicographie&quot; and was the co-editor, with Ernst Windisch, of the &quot;Irische Texte&quot; series. In 1876 Stokes&#x27;s translation of Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii, along with a written introduction, was published.

In 1862 he was awarded the Cunningham Gold Medal by the Royal Irish Academy.

==Death and reputation==
Stokes died at his London home, 15 Grenville Place, Kensington, in 1909 and is buried in Paddington Old Cemetery, Willesden Lane, where his grave is marked by a Celtic cross. Another Celtic cross was erected as a memorial to him at St Fintan&#x27;s, Sutton, Dublin. The Gaelic League paper &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; called Stokes &quot;the greatest of the Celtologists&quot; and expressed pride that an Irishman should have excelled in a field which was at that time dominated by continental scholars. In 1929 the Canadian scholar James F. Kenney described Stokes as &quot;the greatest scholar in philology that Ireland has produced, and the only one that may be ranked with the most famous of continental savants&quot;.

A conference entitled &quot;Ireland, India, London: The Tripartite Life of Whitley Stokes&quot; took place at the University of Cambridge from 18 to 19 September 2009. The event was organised to mark the centenary of Stokes&#x27;s death. A volume of essays based on the papers delivered at this conference, &quot;The Tripartite Life of Whitley Stokes (1830–1909)&quot;, was published by Four Courts Press in autumn 2011.

In 2010 Dáibhí Ó Cróinín published &quot;Whitley Stokes (1830–1909): The Lost Celtic Notebooks Rediscovered&quot;, a volume based on the scholarship in Stokes&#x27;s 150 notebooks which had been resting unnoticed at the University Library, Leipzig since 1919.

== Collections ==
In 1910 Stokes&#x27; daughters presented University College London with their father&#x27;s library. The collection spans c.2000 books, many of which contain autograph letters between Stokes and Kuno Meyer, and from other philologists. Stokes&#x27; archive also resides at University College London; the 4 box collection comprises his working notes on philology.

<doc id="252350" wikidata="Q1326200" url="?curid=252350" title="Ptelea trifoliata">
<text>Ptelea trifoliata, commonly known as common hoptree, wafer ash, stinking ash, and skunk bush, is a species of flowering plant in the citrus family (Rutaceae). It is native to North America, where it is found in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It is a deciduous shrub or tree, with alternate, trifoliate leaves.

==Description==
&quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot; is a small tree, or often a shrub of a few spreading stems, growing to around tall with a broad crown. The bark is reddish brown to gray brown, with short horizontal lenticels (warty corky ridges), becoming slightly scaly, The plant has an unpleasant odor and bitter taste. Branchlets are dark reddish brown, shining, covered with small excrescences. The twigs are slender to moderately stout, brown with deep U-shaped leaf scars, and with short, light brown, fuzzy buds. It has thick fleshy roots.

===Leaves===
Its leaves are alternate and compound with three leaflets, dotted with oil glands. The leaflets are sessile, ovate or oblong, long by broad, pointed at the base, entire or serrate, and gradually pointed at the apex. They are feather-veined, with a prominent midrib and primary veins. They come out of the bud conduplicate and very downy. When fully grown the leaves are dark green and shiny above and paler green beneath. In autumn they turn a rusty yellow. The petioles are stout, long, with an enlarged base. Stipules are absent. The western and southwestern forms have smaller leaves, , than the eastern forms , an adaptation to the drier climates in the west.

===Flowers===
The flowers are small, across, with 4–5 narrow, greenish white petals. The pedicels are downy. The 4- or 5-part calyx is downy and imbricate in bud. The corolla has four or five petals which are white, downy, spreading, hypogynous, and imbricate in bud. The five stamens alternate with the petals. The pistillate flowers bear rudimentary anthers. The filaments are awl-shaped and more-or-less hairy. The anthers are ovate or cordate, two-celled, with cells opening longitudinally. The ovaries are superior, hairy, abortive in the staminate flowers, two to three-celled. The style is short, the stigma 2- or 3-lobed, with two ovules per cell. Fertile and sterile flowers are produced together in terminal, spreading, compound cymes—the sterile being usually fewer and falling after the anther cells mature.

Flowers are produced in May and June. Some find the odor unpleasant but to others the plant has a delicious scent.

===Fruit===
The fruit is a round wafer-like papery samara, across, light brown, and two-seeded. The fruit ripens in October, and is held on the tree until high winds shake them loose in the early winter.

===Wood===
Its wood is yellow brown; heavy, hard, close-grained, satiny. The specific gravity is 0.8319; weight per cubic foot is .

==Taxonomy==
While &quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot; is most often treated as a single species with subspecies and/or varieties in different distribution ranges, some botanists treat the various hoptrees as a group of four or more closely related species:
*&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;trifoliata&quot; – common hoptree or eastern hoptree; eastern Canada &amp; United States (U.S.), central U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;trifoliata&quot; var. &quot;trifoliata&quot; – eastern Canada &amp; (U.S.), central U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp &quot;trifoliata&quot; var. &quot;mollis&quot; – eastern and central U.S.
*&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;angustifolia&quot; – south-central U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;angustifolia&quot; var. &quot;angustifolia&quot; (&quot;P. angustifolia&quot;, &quot;P. lutescens&quot;) – narrowleaf hoptree; south-central U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;angustifolia&quot; var. &quot;persicifolia&quot; – south-central U.S.
*&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;pallida&quot; – pallid hoptree, south-central and southwest U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;pallida&quot; var. &quot;pallida&quot; – southwest U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;pallida&quot; var. &quot;cognata&quot; – southwest U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;pallida&quot; var. &quot;confinis&quot; – south-central and southwest U.S.
**&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;pallida&quot; var. &quot;lutescens&quot; – southwest U.S.
*&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;polyadenia&quot; – pallid hoptree, south-central and southwest U.S.
*&quot;P. trifoliata&quot; var. &quot;baldwinii&quot; (&quot;P. baldwinii&quot;)

The specific epithet &quot;trifoliata&quot; refers to the three-parted compound leaf.

Other common names for this shrub include stinking prairie bush, Carolina shrub-trefoil, tree-trefoil, swamp dogwood, ague bark, paleleaf hoptree, prairie-grub, prickaway-anise, quinine tree, sang-tree, water-ash, western hoptree, wingseed, and woolly hoptree.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot; is native to North America, where its northern limits are in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. It is native through much of the eastern and southwestern United States, although it is absent from some areas of the Upper Midwest and is rare in much of New England. Its southern limits are in Mexico.

It has a wide-ranging natural habitat. In the Southeastern United States it is most often found in rocky forests, in both moist and dry soil, often associated with calcareous or mafic substrates. In the Midwest, habitats include forests, savannas, prairies, glades, and sand dunes. In Arizona it is common in canyons.

==Ecology==
Larva of the giant swallowtail butterfly &quot;Papilio cresphontes&quot; feed on the leaves. Treehoppers of the genus &quot;Enchenopa&quot; infest the branches, laying white-frothy masses of eggs on the branch undersides. Several ant species tend to the treehoppers, including &quot;Camponotus pennsylvanicus&quot;, &quot;Formica montana&quot;, and &quot;Formica subsericea&quot;. Several bee species have been documented visiting the flowers of wafer ash, including &quot;Agapostemon virescens&quot;, &quot;Andrena commoda&quot;, &quot;Andrena crataegi&quot;, &quot;Andrena cressonii&quot;, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, &quot;Bombus auricomus&quot;, &quot;Bombus bimaculatus&quot;, &quot;Bombus impatiens&quot;, &quot;Ceratina calcarata&quot;, &quot;Ceratina dupla&quot;, &quot;Ceratina mikmaqi&quot;, and &quot;Lasioglossum imitatum&quot;.

==Uses==
It has several Native American uses as a seasoning and as an herbal medicine for different ailments.

Numerous cultivars have been developed for ornamental use in parks and gardens. The cultivar &#x27;Aurea&#x27; with golden leaves has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

German immigrants to Texas in the 19th century used its seeds in place of hops in the beer-making process, lending the species its common name.

<doc id="252353" wikidata="Q1376924" url="?curid=252353" title="Frederic William Maitland">
<text>Frederic William Maitland (28 May 1850 – ) was an English historian and jurist who is regarded as the modern father of English legal history. From 1884 until his death in 1906, he was reader in English law, then Downing Professor of the Laws of England at the University of Cambridge.

Born into a distinguished intellectual family, Maitland was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. Leaving for the bar after an initial failure to obtain a fellowship at Cambridge, he returned to academia in 1884, and quickly became one of the most distinguished historians of his generation.

== Early life and education, 1850–72 ==
Frederic William Maitland was born on 28 May 1850 at 53 Guilford Street in London. He was the only son and second of three children of John Gorham Maitland and of Emma, daughter of John Frederic Daniell. His grandfather was Samuel Roffey Maitland. Maitland&#x27;s father was a barrister but, having little practice, became a civil servant, serving as secretary to the Civil Service Commission.

Maitland was educated at a preparatory school in Brighton before entering Eton College in 1863, where Edward Daniel Stone was his private tutor. At Eton, Maitland was not prominent either academically or athletically, although a close school friend thought he would become &quot;a kind of philosophic Charles Lamb&quot;. He then matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1869 as a commoner. A dislike of classics acquired at Eton initially led him to read mathematics, with little success. Then, inspired by Henry Sidgwick, he switched to the relatively new moral sciences tripos in 1870, and took first-class honours in 1872, being bracketed senior with his friend William Cunningham; he was elected a scholar of his college the same year. The following year, he took his degree and won the Whewell Scholarship in international law.

Popular among his contemporaries, Maitland was elected secretary, then president, of the Cambridge Union. He was also, like his father before him, a Cambridge Apostle. A lover of exercise since his Eton days, he rowed for Trinity and ran for the university, winning a blue for representing the university in three-mile races.

Maitland&#x27;s mother had died in 1851, shortly after the birth of his younger sister. Then, both his father and grandfather died when he was still at school. From his grandfather, he inherited a manor house and some land in Brookthorpe, Gloucestershire. The estate provided him with an income until the agricultural depression in the 1880s.

== Career at the bar and early efforts, 1872–84 ==

=== Career at the bar ===
After Cambridge, Maitland tried to gain a fellowship in philosophy at Trinity College in 1875 with a dissertation entitled &quot;A Historical Sketch of Liberty and Equality: As Ideals of English Political Philosophy from the Time of Hobbes to the Time of Coleridge&quot;, but was beaten out by fellow Apostle James Ward. Having joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a student in 1872, he was called to the bar there in 1876, and became a competent equity lawyer and conveyancer.

Meanwhile, encouraged by Sidgwick, he began a book on property law, but abandoned it out of frustration at certain features of English property law; he expressed these sentiments in an anonymous article in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; in 1879, described as &quot;a bold, eloquent, and humorous plea for a sweeping change in the English law of Real Property&quot;. It was followed by three further articles in the &quot;Law Magazine and Review&quot; between 1881 and 1883.

=== Meeting with Vinogradoff ===
In 1880, Maitland was introduced by Frederick Pollock, who had been to Eton and Cambridge with him, to the Sunday Tramps, a walking club founded by Leslie Stephen. Through Pollock, Maitland was introduced in 1884 to Paul Vinogradoff, a Russian medievalist who was in England to study records lodged in the Public Record Office.

Maitland would later write that the day of his first meeting with Vinogradoff &quot;determined the rest of my life&quot;. According to H. A. L. Fisher, Maitland was so chagrined by the fact that a Russian knew more about English legal records than he did that he made his first visit to the PRO shortly thereafter, though Geoffrey Elton points out that Maitland had already been working in the archives before he met Vinogradoff. The result of Maitland&#x27;s initial work was &quot;Pleas of the Crown for the County of Gloucester&quot;, a transcription of the 1221 Gloucestershire eyre roll, which he published at his own expense in 1884 and dedicated to Vinogradoff.

== Return to Cambridge and marriage, 1884–88 ==
In 1884, Maitland was elected Reader in English law at Cambridge, having failed to be elected to a readership at Oxford the previous year. The post had been personally endowed by Sidgwick, to the tune of £300 a year for four years. In 1887, Maitland published, again at his own expense, an edition of Bracton&#x27;s notebook in three volumes, acting on a suggestion by Vinogradoff. He also published extensively on legal history in the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, which was edited by Sidgwick.

On 20 July 1886, Maitland married Florence Henrietta Fisher in a village church in Hampshire. He had met her through Stephen: her aunt was Stephen&#x27;s second wife. Fisher was the daughter of Herbert William Fisher and the sister of H. A. L. Fisher, a future Liberal minister and Maitland&#x27;s biographer. They had two daughters: Ermengard (named after a woman whose name appeared in Bracton&#x27;s notebook) in 1887 and Fredegond in 1889. By all accounts the marriage was a success, and the household a happy one.

=== Selden Society ===
In 1887, Maitland was among the founders of the Selden Society, established to promote the study of the history of English law, mainly through the publication of English legal manuscripts. The Society&#x27;s first years were rocky: its treasurer, P. E. Dove, committed suicide in 1894, leaving behind a deficit of £1,000. Nevertheless, the Society published a steady stream of volumes under Maitland&#x27;s direction as its first literary director. He personally edited eight volumes for the Society, contributed to more, and personally reviewed the proofs of every volume.

== Downing Professor, 1888–1906 ==

In 1888, Maitland was elected Downing Professor of the Laws of England, becoming a fellow of Downing College. On 13 October 1888, he gave his inaugural lecture, &quot;Why the History of English Law is Not Written&quot;. The post carried with it an official residence, and Maitland&#x27;s family settled in happily. He held frequent musical gatherings, and kept a series of exotic pets, including a monkey, a meerkat, and a badger. The same year, he published &quot;Select pleas of the Crown, A.D. 1200–1225&quot;, the first publication of the Selden Society.

In addition to teaching duties, Maitland served on numerous University and college bodies. He advocated for a number of reforms, including the abandonment of Greek as a compulsory entrance subject and the admission of women to degrees. In March 1897 he helped defeat a proposal for the creation of a Queen&#x27;s University for women only as an alternative to granting them Cambridge degrees, making a speech which was long afterwards remembered.

Meanwhile, Maitland published extensively, making important contributions to the &quot;Cambridge Modern History&quot;, the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and other publications. He delivered the Ford Lectures in English history at Oxford in 1897 (later published as &quot;Township and Borough&quot;) and the Rede Lecture in 1901. His most important work, &quot;The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I&quot;, appeared in 1895. It was co-authored with his friend Sir Frederick Pollock, though the latter wrote only the chapter on Anglo-Saxon law: &quot;Chapter 1...was Pollock&#x27;s work, and Maitland&#x27;s reaction was never to let him write another.&quot; Popularly known as &quot;Pollock and Maitland&quot;, &quot;The History of English Law&quot; has been described as &quot;the best book on English legal history ever published in the English language.&quot;

In 1902 Maitland was offered the Regius Professorship of Modern History at Cambridge by Arthur Balfour in succession to Lord Acton, but declined. In the same year he became one of the founding fellows of the British Academy.

== Final years and death ==
Maitland&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in the 1890s: the exact nature of his illness remains unclear but has been variously ascribed to tuberculosis or to diabetes. In 1898 he suffered from an attack of pleurisy, and thereafter he wintered either in the Canary Islands or in Madeira. In December 1906, he left Cambridge for the Canaries for the last time: during the trip, he contracted influenza, which turned into double pneumonia. He died at Las Palmas and was buried in the English Cemetery there.

Upon his death, the University of Oxford presented an address of condolence to Cambridge, described by Geoffrey Elton as an &quot;unprecedented tribute.&quot; Such addresses were often presented to the royal family, but the only precedent in the case of Maitland was an address to the University of Berlin upon the death of Theodor Mommsen.

Posthumous publications by his students, editing their lecture notes based on his lectures, include &quot;The Constitutional History of England&quot;, &quot;Equity&quot;, and &quot;The Forms of Action at Common Law&quot;. The latter publication has been repeatedly reprinted, and contains perhaps his most-quoted observation, which still appears in learned articles and superior court judgments: &quot;The forms of action we have buried but still they rule us from their graves.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Maitland married Florence Henrietta Fisher, daughter of the historian Herbert William Fisher, in 1886 and they had two daughters, Ermengard (1887–1968) and Fredegond (1889–1949); after Maitland&#x27;s death his widow married Sir Francis Darwin, a son of Charles Darwin.

Maitland was a moderate Liberal in politics, sympathizing with the Liberal Party but striving to maintain objectivity in his scholarship. Florence Fisher&#x27;s brother, the Liberal scholar and politician H. A. L. Fisher, edited Maitland&#x27;s papers and lectures on English constitutional history after his death.

== Scholarship ==

=== Approach and style ===
His written style was elegant and lively. His historical method was distinguished by his thorough and sensitive use of historical sources, and by his determinedly historical perspective. Maitland taught his students, and all later historians, not to investigate the history of law purely or mostly by reference to the needs of the present, but rather to consider and seek to understand the past on its own terms.

=== &quot;Memoranda de Parliamento&quot; ===
In 1889, Maitland was invited by Henry Maxwell Lyte, the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, to examine and edit the petitions presented to Edward I&#x27;s parliament. Maitland quickly determined that the task was too large to be completed by one man. However, by chance, he discovered a hitherto unpublished parliament roll from 1305, which he edited and published in 1893 as part of the Rolls Series. This formed the basis of what Elton described as his &quot;most explosive contribution to English history&quot;.

At the time, it was generally believed that early English parliaments were, from the beginning, an assembly of the estates of the realm who met to discuss affairs of state. This view had been laid down by Stubbs, who had based his view on the 1295 &quot;Model Parliament&quot;. In his introduction to the 1305 roll, Maitland instead proposed that early English parliaments were judicial bodies which met mainly to receive petitions to address grievances. Though the revolutionary nature of Maitland&#x27;s suggestion was realised only later, most historians have come to accept Maitland&#x27;s view.

=== &quot;Why the history of English Law is not written?&quot; ===
On 13 October 1888, Maitland gave his inaugural lecture as Downing Professor of the Laws of England. Pointing out that &quot;no attempt has ever been made to write the history of English law as a whole&quot;, he proposed two causes: the insularity of English law and the conflicting logics of the lawyer and of the historian.

== Assessment ==
Maitland was held in high regard by his contemporaries. Lord Acton called him the ablest historian in England.

Maitland&#x27;s reputation has stood high since his death. Speaking in 1980, S. F. C. Milsom said that Maitland is &quot;not just revered but loved&quot; by historians, while in 1985, Sir Geoffrey Elton wrote of Maitland as the &quot;patron saint&quot; of historians.

Beginning in the 1960s, scholars such as S. F. C. Milsom and Patrick Wormald began to point out shortcomings in Maitland&#x27;s views, which had by then become the orthodoxy, although the criticisms were inevitably coupled with sincere admiration for Maitland. The highly technical nature of Maitland&#x27;s work, as well as the relative decline of legal history, made Maitland&#x27;s views &quot;lasting orthodoxies&quot;, as few historians had either the technical knowledge or the inclination to challenge them. Speaking on the centenary of the publication of &quot;Pollock and Maitland&quot;, Milsom said that:&quot;if we go on as we are, we can look forward to our successors celebrating the bicentenary of &#x27;Pollock and Maitland&#x27; as still the last word on the history of English law in its most crucial period. I wonder whether he would be pleased.&quot;

==Honours and memorials==
During his lifetime, Maitland received honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1891), Oxford (1899), Glasgow (1896), Moscow and Kracow. He was one of the founding fellows of the British Academy in 1902, and was a corresponding member of the Royal Prussian Academy of the Arts and of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He was also an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and an honorary bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. On the latter honour, Maitland wrote to Pollock that &quot;one of the vacant bishoprics would have been less of a surprise&quot;. Just before his death, Maitland received the Ames Medal from Harvard Law School, and at the time of his death, he had been invited by Oxford to deliver the Romanes Lecture.

After his death, the F. W. Maitland Memorial Fund was established at Cambridge in 1907 to promote research in legal history. It continues to award grants and studentships for that purpose. In 2000, a Maitland Legal History Room was established within the Squire Law Library of the Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge. The Maitland Historical Society of Downing College, Cambridge, is also named in his honour.

At Oxford, a Maitland Library, begun with 300 books from Maitland&#x27;s personal library, was established in 1908. Originally housed at All Souls College, Oxford, it was eventually taken over by the Bodleian Library, and was maintained as a separate collection until 1933.

In 2001, a memorial stone for Maitland was unveiled in Poet&#x27;s Corner, Westminster Abbey; he was the first professional historian to be so honoured. The stone, cut by Richard Kindersley, is inscribed with a quote from &quot;Doomsday Book and Beyond&quot;: &quot;By slow degrees the thoughts of our forefathers their common thoughts about common things will have become thinkable once more&quot;.

<text>William Stubbs (21 June 182522 April 1901) was an English historian and Anglican bishop. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford between 1866 and 1884. He was Bishop of Chester from 1884 to 1889 and Bishop of Oxford from 1889 to 1901.

==Early life==
The son of William Morley Stubbs, a solicitor, and his wife, Mary Ann Henlock, he was born in a house on the High Street in Knaresborough, Yorkshire, and was educated at Ripon Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated MA in 1848, obtaining a first-class in Literae Humaniores and a third in mathematics.

==Education and career to 1889==
Stubbs was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, during his time living in Navestock, Essex, from 1850 to 1866, where he served as parish priest for the same period.

In 1859, he married Catherine Dellar, daughter of John Dellar, of Navestock, and they had several children. He was librarian at Lambeth Palace, and in 1862 was an unsuccessful candidate for the Chichele Professorship of Modern History at Oxford.

In 1866, Stubbs was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, and held the chair until 1884. His lectures were thinly attended, and he found them a distraction from his historical work. Some of his statutory lectures are published in his &quot;Lectures on Mediaeval and Modern History&quot;. In 1872, he founded Oxford University&#x27;s School of Modern History, allowing postclassical history to be taught as a distinct subject for the first time. He accepted the patronage of the Stubbs Society during his time at Oxford, where he interacted with future doyens of the historical profession.

Stubbs was rector of Cholderton, Wiltshire, from 1875 to 1879, when he was appointed a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He served on the ecclesiastical courts commission of 1881–1883 and wrote the weighty appendices to the report. On 25 April 1884 he was consecrated Bishop of Chester, and in 1889 became Bishop of Oxford until his death. As Bishop of Oxford he was also &quot;ex officio&quot; the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, and served as vice-president from 1884.

==Approach to church office==
Stubbs was a High Churchman whose doctrines and practice were grounded on learning and a veneration for antiquity. His opinions were received with marked respect by his brother prelates, and he acted as an assessor to the archbishop in the trial of Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.

==Final illness and death==
An attack of illness in November 1900 seriously impaired Stubbs&#x27;s health. He was able, however, to attend the funeral of Queen Victoria on 2 February 1901, and preached a remarkable sermon before King Edward VII and the German Emperor Wilhelm II on the following day. Stubbs&#x27;s illness became critical on 20 April. He died in Cuddesdon on 22 April 1901. Stubbs was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Cuddesdon, next to the palace of the bishops of Oxford.

==Honours and degrees==
Both in England and America, Stubbs was universally acknowledged as the head of all English historical scholars, and no English historian of his time was held in equal honour in European countries. Among his many distinctions he was D.D. and honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, LL.D. of Cambridge and Edinburgh, Doctor &quot;in utroque jure&quot; of Heidelberg; an hon. member of the University of Kyiv, and of the Prussian, Bavarian and Danish academies; he received the Prussian order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, and was corresponding member of the &quot;Académie des sciences morales et politiques&quot; of the French Institute. Stubbs was elected an International Honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1881, an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1891, and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1897.

==Reception==
Until Stubbs found it necessary to devote all his time to his episcopal duties, he had concentrated on historical study. He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, but either may advantageously be studied apart. He also believed that the effects of individual character and human nature will render generalizations vague and useless. While pointing out that history is useful as a mental discipline and a part of a liberal education, he recommended its study chiefly for its own sake. It was in this spirit that he worked; he had the faculty of judgment and a genius for minute and critical investigation. He was equally eminent in ecclesiastical history, as an editor of texts and as the historian of the British constitution.

In 1858 Stubbs published his &quot;Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum&quot;, (with a second edition published in 1897) which sets forth episcopal consecration data in England from 597 CE, which was followed by many other later works, and particularly by his share in &quot;Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents&quot;, edited in co-operation with the Rev. A. W. Haddan, for the third volume of which he was especially responsible. He edited nineteen volumes for the Rolls series of &quot;Chronicles and Memorials&quot;.

It is, however, by Stubbs&#x27;s &quot;Constitutional History of England&quot; (3 vols., 1874–78) that he is most widely known as a historian. It became at once the standard authority on its subject. The appearance of this book, which traces the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain till 1485, marks a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning. It was followed by its companion volume of &quot;Select Charters and Other Illustrations of English Constitutional History&quot;.

===His merits as a historian===
By Stubbs&#x27;s contemporaries and after his death, Stubbs was considered to have been in the front rank of historical scholars both as an author and a critic, and as a master of every department of the historian&#x27;s work, from the discovery of materials to the elaboration of well founded theories and literary production. He was a good palaeographer, and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition. His merits as an author are often judged solely by his &quot;Constitutional History&quot;.

However, Stubbs&#x27;s work is not entirely unquestionable. Some modern historians have questioned his acceptance of some medieval chronicles, written by monastical scribes whose views would be, to some extent, influenced by the politics of the Catholic Church. One such criticism was Stubbs&#x27;s tirade against William Rufus whose character was much-maligned by the chroniclers perhaps due to his opposition to Gregorian reforms during his reign, which led to Archbishop Anselm going into exile.

Among the most notable examples of Stubbs&#x27;s work for the Rolls series are the prefaces to Roger of Hoveden, the &quot;Gesta regum&quot; of William of Malmesbury, the &quot;Gesta Henrici II&quot;, and the Memorials of St. Dunstan.

==Modern views of him==
In the main Stubbs&#x27;s ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by K. B. McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;community of interest&quot; theory; the idea that the amount of possible conflict between a king and his nobles was actually very small (case in point, Henry IV, 1399–1413). Historians like Michael Hicks, Rosemary Horrox and notably May McKisack, have pushed this view further.

J. W. Burrow proposed that Stubbs, like John Richard Green and Edward Augustus Freeman, was an historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present which were romantically historicised and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making
the new historiography of early medieval times an extension, filling out and democratising, of older Whig notions of continuity. It was Stubbs who presented this most substantially; Green who made it popular and dramatic... It is in Freeman...of the three the most purely a narrative historian, that the strains are most apparent.

<text>In mathematical logic, a sequent is a very general kind of conditional assertion.

: formula_1

A sequent may have any number &quot;m&quot; of condition formulas &quot;Ai&quot; (called &quot;antecedents&quot;) and any number &quot;n&quot; of asserted formulas &quot;Bj&quot; (called &quot;succedents&quot; or &quot;consequents&quot;). A sequent is understood to mean that if all of the antecedent conditions are true, then at least one of the consequent formulas is true. This style of conditional assertion is almost always associated with the conceptual framework of sequent calculus.

== Introduction ==

=== The form and semantics of sequents ===

Sequents are best understood in the context of the following three kinds of logical judgments:

Thus sequents are a generalization of simple conditional assertions, which are a generalization of unconditional assertions.

The word &quot;OR&quot; here is the inclusive OR. The motivation for disjunctive semantics on the right side of a sequent comes from three main benefits.
# The symmetry of the classical inference rules for sequents with such semantics.
# The ease and simplicity of converting such classical rules to intuitionistic rules.
# The ability to prove completeness for predicate calculus when it is expressed in this way.
All three of these benefits were identified in the founding paper by .

Not all authors have adhered to Gentzen&#x27;s original meaning for the word &quot;sequent&quot;. For example, used the word &quot;sequent&quot; strictly for simple conditional assertions with one and only one consequent formula. The same single-consequent definition for a sequent is given by .

=== Syntax details ===
In a general sequent of the form
:formula_2
both Γ and Σ are sequences of logical formulas, not sets. Therefore both the number and order of occurrences of formulas are significant. In particular, the same formula may appear twice in the same sequence. The full set of sequent calculus inference rules contains rules to swap adjacent formulas on the left and on the right of the assertion symbol (and thereby arbitrarily permute the left and right sequences), and also to insert arbitrary formulas and remove duplicate copies within the left and the right sequences. (However, , uses &quot;sets&quot; of formulas in sequents instead of sequences of formulas. Consequently the three pairs of &quot;structural rules&quot; called &quot;thinning&quot;, &quot;contraction&quot; and &quot;interchange&quot; are not required.)

The symbol &#x27; formula_3 &#x27; is often referred to as the &quot;turnstile&quot;, &quot;right tack&quot;, &quot;tee&quot;, &quot;assertion sign&quot; or &quot;assertion symbol&quot;. It is often read, suggestively, as &quot;yields&quot;, &quot;proves&quot; or &quot;entails&quot;.

=== Properties ===

==== Effects of inserting and removing propositions ====
Since every formula in the antecedent (the left side) must be true to conclude the truth of at least one formula in the succedent (the right side), adding formulas to either side results in a weaker sequent, while removing them from either side gives a stronger one. This is one of the symmetry advantages which follows from the use of disjunctive semantics on the right hand side of the assertion symbol, whereas conjunctive semantics is adhered to on the left hand side.

==== Consequences of empty lists of formulas ====
In the extreme case where the list of &quot;antecedent&quot; formulas of a sequent is empty, the consequent is unconditional. This differs from the simple unconditional assertion because the number of consequents is arbitrary, not necessarily a single consequent. Thus for example, &#x27; ⊢ &quot;B1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot; &#x27; means that either &quot;B1&quot;, or &quot;B2&quot;, or both must be true. An empty antecedent formula list is equivalent to the &quot;always true&quot; proposition, called the &quot;verum&quot;, denoted &quot;⊤&quot;. (See Tee (symbol).)

In the extreme case where the list of &quot;consequent&quot; formulas of a sequent is empty, the rule is still that at least one term on the right be true, which is clearly impossible. This is signified by the &#x27;always false&#x27; proposition, called the &quot;falsum&quot;, denoted &quot;⊥&quot;. Since the consequence is false, at least one of the antecedents must be false. Thus for example, &#x27; &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot; ⊢ &#x27; means that at least one of the antecedents &quot;A1&quot; and &quot;A2&quot; must be false.

One sees here again a symmetry because of the disjunctive semantics on the right hand side. If the left side is empty, then one or more right-side propositions must be true. If the right side is empty, then one or more of the left-side propositions must be false.

The doubly extreme case &#x27; ⊢ &#x27;, where both the antecedent and consequent lists of formulas are empty is &quot;not satisfiable&quot;. In this case, the meaning of the sequent is effectively &#x27; ⊤ ⊢ ⊥ &#x27;. This is equivalent to the sequent &#x27; ⊢ ⊥ &#x27;, which clearly cannot be valid.

=== Examples ===
A sequent of the form &#x27; ⊢ α, β &#x27;, for logical formulas α and β, means that either α is true or β is true (or both). But it does not mean that either α is a tautology or β is a tautology. To clarify this, consider the example &#x27; ⊢ B ∨ A, C ∨ ¬A &#x27;. This is a valid sequent because either B ∨ A is true or C ∨ ¬A is true. But neither of these expressions is a tautology in isolation. It is the &quot;disjunction&quot; of these two expressions which is a tautology.

Similarly, a sequent of the form &#x27; α, β ⊢ &#x27;, for logical formulas α and β, means that either α is false or β is false. But it does not mean that either α is a contradiction or β is a contradiction. To clarify this, consider the example &#x27; B ∧ A, C ∧ ¬A ⊢ &#x27;. This is a valid sequent because either B ∧ A is false or C ∧ ¬A is false. But neither of these expressions is a contradiction in isolation. It is the &quot;conjunction&quot; of these two expressions which is a contradiction.

=== Rules ===
Most proof systems provide ways to deduce one sequent from another. These inference rules are written with a list of sequents above and below a line. This rule indicates that if everything above the line is true, so is everything under the line.

A typical rule is:

:formula_4

This indicates that if we can deduce that formula_5 yields formula_6, and that formula_7 yields formula_8, then we can also deduce that formula_7 yields formula_6. (See also the full set of sequent calculus inference rules.)

== Interpretation ==

=== History of the meaning of sequent assertions ===
The assertion symbol in sequents originally meant exactly the same as the implication operator. But over time, its meaning has changed to signify provability within a theory rather than semantic truth in all models.

In 1934, Gentzen did not define the assertion symbol &#x27; ⊢ &#x27; in a sequent to signify provability. He defined it to mean exactly the same as the implication operator &#x27; ⇒ &#x27;. Using &#x27; → &#x27; instead of &#x27; ⊢ &#x27; and &#x27; ⊃ &#x27; instead of &#x27; ⇒ &#x27;, he wrote: &quot;The sequent A1, ..., Aμ → B1, ..., Bν signifies, as regards content, exactly the same as the formula (A1 &amp; ... &amp; Aμ) ⊃ (B1 ∨ ... ∨ Bν)&quot;. (Gentzen employed the right-arrow symbol between the antecedents and consequents of sequents. He employed the symbol &#x27; ⊃ &#x27; for the logical implication operator.)

In 1939, Hilbert and Bernays stated likewise that a sequent has the same meaning as the corresponding implication formula.

In 1944, Alonzo Church emphasized that Gentzen&#x27;s sequent assertions did not signify provability.

: &quot;Employment of the deduction theorem as primitive or derived rule must not, however, be confused with the use of &quot;Sequenzen&quot; by Gentzen. For Gentzen&#x27;s arrow, →, is not comparable to our syntactical notation, ⊢, but belongs to his object language (as is clear from the fact that expressions containing it appear as premisses and conclusions in applications of his rules of inference).&quot;

Numerous publications after this time have stated that the assertion symbol in sequents does signify provability within the theory where the sequents are formulated. Curry in 1963, Lemmon in 1965, and Huth and Ryan in 2004 all state that the sequent assertion symbol signifies provability. However, states that the assertion symbol in Gentzen-system sequents, which he denotes as &#x27; ⇒ &#x27;, is part of the object language, not the metalanguage.

According to Prawitz (1965): &quot;The calculi of sequents can be understood as meta-calculi for the deducibility relation in the corresponding systems of natural deduction.&quot; And furthermore: &quot;A proof in a calculus of sequents can be looked upon as an instruction on how to construct a corresponding natural deduction.&quot; In other words, the assertion symbol is part of the object language for the sequent calculus, which is a kind of meta-calculus, but simultaneously signifies deducibility in an underlying natural deduction system.

=== Intuitive meaning ===

A sequent is a formalized statement of provability that is frequently used when specifying calculi for deduction. In the sequent calculus, the name &quot;sequent&quot; is used for the construct, which can be regarded as a specific kind of judgment, characteristic to this deduction system.

The intuitive meaning of the sequent formula_2 is that under the assumption of Γ the conclusion of Σ is provable. Classically, the formulae on the left of the turnstile can be interpreted conjunctively while the formulae on the right can be considered as a disjunction. This means that, when all formulae in Γ hold, then at least one formula in Σ also has to be true. If the succedent is empty, this is interpreted as falsity, i.e. formula_12 means that Γ proves falsity and is thus inconsistent. On the other hand an empty antecedent is assumed to be true, i.e., formula_13 means that Σ follows without any assumptions, i.e., it is always true (as a disjunction). A sequent of this form, with Γ empty, is known as a logical assertion.

Of course, other intuitive explanations are possible, which are classically equivalent. For example, formula_2 can be read as asserting that it cannot be the case that every formula in Γ is true and every formula in Σ is false (this is related to the double-negation interpretations of classical intuitionistic logic, such as Glivenko&#x27;s theorem).

In any case, these intuitive readings are only pedagogical. Since formal proofs in proof theory are purely syntactic, the meaning of (the derivation of) a sequent is only given by the properties of the calculus that provides the actual rules of inference.

Barring any contradictions in the technically precise definition above we can describe sequents in their introductory logical form. formula_7 represents a set of assumptions that we begin our logical process with, for example &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; and &quot;All men are mortal&quot;. The formula_6 represents a logical conclusion that follows under these premises. For example &quot;Socrates is mortal&quot; follows from a reasonable formalization of the above points and we could expect to see it on the formula_6 side of the &quot;turnstile&quot;. In this sense, formula_3 means the process of reasoning, or &quot;therefore&quot; in English.

== Variations ==

The general notion of sequent introduced here can be specialized in various ways. A sequent is said to be an intuitionistic sequent if there is at most one formula in the succedent (although multi-succedent calculi for intuitionistic logic are also possible). More precisely, the restriction of the general sequent calculus to single-succedent-formula sequents, &quot;with the same inference rules&quot; as for general sequents, constitutes an intuitionistic sequent calculus. (This restricted sequent calculus is denoted LJ.)

Similarly, one can obtain calculi for dual-intuitionistic logic (a type of paraconsistent logic) by requiring that sequents be singular in the antecedent.

In many cases, sequents are also assumed to consist of multisets or sets instead of sequences. Thus one disregards the order or even the numbers of occurrences of the formulae. For classical propositional logic this does not yield a problem, since the conclusions that one can draw from a collection of premises do not depend on these data. In substructural logic, however, this may become quite important.

Natural deduction systems use single-consequence conditional assertions, but they typically do not use the same sets of inference rules as Gentzen introduced in 1934. In particular, tabular natural deduction systems, which are very convenient for practical theorem-proving in propositional calculus and predicate calculus, were applied by and for teaching introductory logic in textbooks.

== Etymology ==
Historically, sequents have been introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in order to specify his famous sequent calculus. In his German publication he used the word &quot;Sequenz&quot;. However, in English, the word &quot;sequence&quot; is already used as a translation to the German &quot;Folge&quot; and appears quite frequently in mathematics. The term &quot;sequent&quot; then has been created in search for an alternative translation of the German expression.

Kleene makes the following comment on the translation into English: &quot;Gentzen says &#x27;Sequenz&#x27;, which we translate as &#x27;sequent&#x27;, because we have already used &#x27;sequence&#x27; for any succession of objects, where the German is &#x27;Folge&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="252359" wikidata="Q1976412" url="?curid=252359" title="Paul Vinogradoff">
<text>Sir Paul Gavrilovitch Vinogradoff (; – 19 December 1925) was a Russian and British historian and medievalist. He was a leading thinker in the development of historical jurisprudence and legal history as disciplines.

== Early life ==
Vinogradoff was born in Kostroma and was educated at the local gymnasium and Moscow University, where he studied history under Vasily Klyuchevsky. After graduating in 1875, he obtained a scholarship to continue his studies in Berlin, where he studied under Theodor Mommsen and Heinrich Brunner.

==Career==
Vinogradoff became professor of history at the University of Moscow, but his zeal for the spread of education brought him into conflict with the authorities, and consequently he was obliged to leave Russia. Having settled in England, Vinogradoff brought a powerful and original mind to bear upon the social and economic conditions of early England, a subject which he had already begun to study in Moscow.

Vinogradoff visited Britain for the first time in 1883, working on records in the Public Records Office and meeting leading English scholars such as Sir Henry Maine and Sir Frederick Pollock. He also met Frederic William Maitland, who was heavily influenced by their meeting.

Vinogradoff was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1897.

In 1903, he was elected to the position of Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Oxford, and held this position until he died in 1925. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1905. He received honorary degrees from the principal universities (including D.C.L. from the University of Oxford in October 1902, in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library.), was made a member of several foreign academies and was appointed honorary professor of history at Moscow.

Upon the death of Maitland, Vinogradoff became the literary director of the Selden Society with Sir Frederick Pollock, a position he held until 1920. During World War I he gave valuable assistance to the British Foreign Office in connection with Russian affairs. Vinogradoff was knighted in 1917, and he and his children were naturalized as British subjects in 1918.

In 1925, Vinogradoff traveled to Paris to receive an honorary degree; while in Paris, he developed pneumonia and died there on 19 December.

==Books==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Eleventh Edition, published in 1911, Vinogradoff&#x27;s &quot;Villainage in England&quot; (1892) was &quot;perhaps the most important book written on the peasantry of the feudal age and the village community in England; it can only be compared for value with FW Maitland&#x27;s &quot;Domesday Book and Beyond&quot;. In masterly fashion Vinogradoff here shows that the villein of Norman times was the direct descendant of the Anglo-Saxon freeman, and that the typical Anglo-Saxon settlement was a free community, not a manor, the position of the freeman having steadily deteriorated in the centuries just around the Norman Conquest. The status of the villein and the conditions of the manor in the 12th and 13th centuries are set forth with a legal precision and a wealth of detail which shows its author, not only as a very capable historian, but also as a brilliant and learned jurist.&quot;

The article considered that almost equally valuable was Vinogradoff&#x27;s essay on “Folkland” in vol. viii. of the &quot;English Historical Review&quot; (1893), which proved for the first time the real nature of this kind of land. Vinogradoff followed up his &quot;Villainage in England&quot; with &quot;The Growth of the Manor&quot; (1905) and &quot;English Society in the Eleventh Century&quot; (1908), works on the lines of his earlier book.

In &quot;Outlines in Historical Jurisprudence&quot; (1920–22), Vinogradoff traces the development of basic themes of jurisprudence, including marriage, property, and succession, in six different types of society: the totemistic, the tribal, the ancient city state, the medieval system of feudalism and canon law, and modern industrial society.

<doc id="252364" wikidata="Q198745" url="?curid=252364" title="United Church of Canada">
<text>The United Church of Canada (UCC; ) is a mainline Protestant denomination that is the largest Protestant Christian denomination in Canada and the second largest Canadian Christian denomination after the Catholic Church in Canada.

The United Church was founded in 1925 as a merger of four Protestant denominations with a total combined membership of about 600,000 members: the Methodist Church, Canada, the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec, two-thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Association of Local Union Churches, a movement predominantly of the Canadian Prairie provinces. The Canadian Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church of Canada on January 1, 1968.

Membership peaked in 1964 at 1.1 million. From 1991 to 2001, the number of people claiming an affiliation with the United Church decreased by 8%, the third largest decrease among Canada&#x27;s large Christian denominations. In 2011, Statistics Canada reported approximately 2 million people identifying as adherents. The 2021 Canadian census found that more than 1 million Canadians (3.3% of the population) self-identified with the church, remaining the second-largest Christian denomination in Canada. Church statistics for the end of 2023 showed 2,451 congregations and 325,315 members in 243,689 households under pastoral care, of whom 110,878 attend services regularly.

The United Church has a &quot;council-based&quot; structure, where each council (congregational, regional, or denominational) has specific responsibilities. In some areas, each of these councils has sole authority, while in others, approval of other councils is required before action is taken. (For example, a congregation requires regional council approval before a minister can be called or appointed to the congregation.) The policies of the church are inclusive and liberal: there are no restrictions of gender, sexual orientation or marital status for a person considering entering the ministry; interfaith marriages are recognized; communion is offered to all Christian adults and children, regardless of denomination or age.

== History ==

In the early 20th century, the main Evangelical Protestant denominations in Canada were the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational churches. Many small towns and villages across Canada had all three, with the town&#x27;s population divided among them. Especially on the prairies, it was difficult to find clergy to serve all these charges, and there were several instances where one minister would serve his congregation, but would also perform pastoral care for the other congregations that lacked a minister. On the prairies, a movement to unite all three major Protestant denominations began, resulting in the Association of Local Union Churches.

Facing a &quot;de facto&quot; union in the western provinces, the three denominations began a slow process of union talks that eventually produced a &quot;Basis for Union&quot;.

However, not all elements of the churches involved were happy with the idea of uniting under one roof; a substantial minority of Presbyterians remained unconvinced of the virtues of church union. Their threat to the entire project was resolved by giving individual Presbyterian congregations the right to vote on whether to enter or remain outside the United Church. In the end, 302 (6.7%) out of 4,509 congregations of the Presbyterian Church (211 from southern Ontario) chose to reconstitute themselves as a &quot;continuing&quot; Presbyterian Church in Canada.

===Inauguration===

The United Church of Canada is an amalgamation of the Union of Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches.

With the three denominations now in agreement about uniting, the church leaders approached the government of Canada to pass legislation concerning transfer of property rights. The legislation passed, June 27, 1924, and was effective June 10, 1925.

The United Church of Canada was inaugurated at a large worship service at Toronto&#x27;s Mutual Street Arena on June 10, 1925. Participants were handed a 38-page order of service containing the full text of the liturgy, prayers, hymns, and music. Hymns from all three churches were sung: &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot; from the Scottish Presbyterian psalm tradition; the Methodist favourite &quot;O for a thousand tongues to sing&quot; by Charles Wesley; the Congregationalist &quot;O God of Bethel&quot;; and &quot;When I survey the wondrous cross&quot; by the British Nonconformist, Isaac Watts.

The ecumenical tone of the new church was set at this first General Council. The former Methodist General Superintendent, Samuel Dwight Chown, was considered the leading candidate to become the first Moderator because the Methodist Church made up the largest segment of the new United Church. However, in a surprise move, Dr. Chown graciously stepped aside in favour of George C. Pidgeon, the moderator of the Presbyterian Church and principal spokesperson for the uniting Presbyterians, in the hopes that this would strengthen the resolve of the Presbyterians who had chosen to join the new Church.
Dr. S.D. Chown, United Church / l&#x27;Église unie was featured on an 8 cent stamp issued by Canada Post on May 30, 1975. 

===Crest===
The crest designed for the new church is a &quot;vesica piscis&quot;, an early Christian symbol that evoked an upended fish (the initials of the phrase &quot;Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour&quot;; in Ancient Greek: ἰχθύς (ikhthús), &quot;ichthys&quot;, meaning &quot;fish&quot;). The central saltire is also the Greek letter Chi, first letter of &quot;Χριστός&quot;, Greek for &quot;Christ&quot;. Within three of the four quadrants are symbols of the founding churches: Presbyterianism (the Burning Bush), Methodism (the dove), and Congregationalism (the open Bible). In the bottom quadrant, the alpha and omega represents the ever-living God (Revelation 1:8). The motto &quot;Ut omnes unum sint&quot; recalls Christ’s “High Priestly Prayer” in John 17:21: &quot;That all may be one&quot;. The entire crest resembles the emblem of the Church of Scotland.

In 2012, the Mohawk phrase &quot;Akwe Nia&#x27;tetewá:neren&quot; (&quot;All my relations&quot;) was added to the perimeter, and the background colours of the four quadrants of the crest were changed to reflect the traditional colours of a typical First Nations medicine wheel.

===1930s===
In 1930, just as mergers of the congregations, colleges and administrative offices of the various denominations were completed and the &quot;United Church Hymnary&quot; was published, Canada was hit by the Great Depression. Although membership remained stable, attendance and givings fell. In the face of overwhelming unemployment, some in the church, both clergy and laity, called for a radical Christian socialist alternative such as the Fellowship for a Christian Social Order. Other more conservative members felt drawn to the message of the Oxford Group that focussed on the wealthier members of society. The great majority of members between these two extremes simply sought to help the unemployed.

In the United States, Methodists had been ordaining women from 1880, but it was still a contentious issue in Canada, and it was not until 1936 that the Reverend Lydia Emelie Gruchy of the Saskatchewan Conference became the first woman in the United Church to be ordained and, in 1953, she became the first Canadian woman to receive an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.

===1940s===
The Second World War was also a divisive issue. Some who had declared themselves pacifist before the war now struggled to reconcile their philosophy with the reality around them. Others remained pacifist—some 65 clergy signed &quot;A Witness Against War&quot; in 1939. But the church as a whole, although it did not support conscription, supported the overall war effort, both on the home front and by providing chaplains for the armed forces.

Although the forced relocation of Japanese Canadians away from the West Coast was supported by most members across Canada, church leaders and missionaries in B.C. spoke out against it, and the churches on the West Coast set up an Emergency Japanese Committee to help fight for the rights of the dislocated people.

In 1943, the Anglican Church invited other denominations to union talks, and the United Church responded enthusiastically; by 1946, the two churches had issued a statement on mutual ministry. In a similar ecumenical vein, the United Church was one of the founding bodies of the Canadian Council of Churches in 1944 and the World Council of Churches in 1946.

===1950s===
The United Church continued to espouse causes that were not politically popular, issuing statements supporting universal health care and the People&#x27;s Republic of China at its 15th General Council (1952–54) at a time when these were considered radical concepts in North America.

Membership and givings increased dramatically as post-war parents started to bring their young families—the Baby Boomers—to church.

Talks with the Anglican Church had not made significant headway during the decade, but in 1958, the two churches decided to continue the conversation.

===1960s===
In 1962, two women&#x27;s auxiliary organizations, Woman&#x27;s Association and Woman&#x27;s Missionary Society, joined to form the United Church Women (UCW). That same year, the United and Anglican churches jointly published &quot;Growth in Understanding&quot;, a study guide on union, and on June 1, 1965, the &quot;Principles of Union&quot; between the United Church and the Anglican Church. The spirit of ecumenism with other denominations stayed strong throughout the decade, culminating in 1968 when the Canada Conference of The Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church.

The high tide mark of membership was reached in 1965 when the church recorded 1,064,000 members. However, there were already rumblings of discontent in the church: that same year, Pierre Berton wrote &quot;The Comfortable Pew&quot;, a bestseller that was highly critical of Canadian churches, and a United Church &quot;Commission on Ministry in the 20th Century&quot; was appointed in response to growing frustration from congregations, presbyteries, and ministers about the role of ministry. The church lost 2,027 members in 1966, a decline of only two-tenths of a percent, but significantly it marked the first time since amalgamation that membership had fallen.

The Vietnam War brought new controversies to the church when in 1968, the secretary of the national Evangelism and Social Service Committee, the Reverend Ray Hord, offered emergency aid to American Vietnam draft dodgers; the General Council Executive disassociated itself from the decision but within two years it became church policy.

===1970s===
In 1971, the ecumenical movement reached its height as a joint commission of the United and Anglican churches and the Disciples of Christ approved a &quot;Plan of Union&quot;, and &quot;The Hymn Book&quot;, a joint publication of the United and Anglican churches was published. The tide quickly turned though, and in 1975, the Anglican House of Bishops and National Executive Council declared that the &quot;Plan of Union&quot; was unacceptable. However, the Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Catholic, and United churches did agree to recognize the validity of Christian baptisms performed in any of these denominations.

Membership continued to decline slowly throughout the decade, despite a report that lay ministry was on the increase.

===1980s===
In 1980, at the 29th General Council, the commissioning of diaconal ministers as a part of ordered ministry was approved.

On August 16, 1980, the 28th General Council elected the first female Moderator, the Reverend Lois Wilson.

On August 17, 1980, a United Church of Canada task force released &quot;In God&#x27;s Image&quot;, its report on sexual ethics which recommended the admission of homosexuals into the ministry and tolerance of premarital sex. Although the report accepted abortion under qualified circumstances, it rejected abortion on demand.

With union talks with the Anglicans already at an end, talks with the Disciples of Christ also ended in 1985.

In 1986, the 31st General Council elected a female Moderator, Anne M. Squire.

In 1988, the 32nd General Council chose to end investment in South Africa, apologize to First Nations congregations for past denials of native spirituality by the church, and elected the first Moderator of Asian descent, Sang Chul Lee. However, those events were largely overshadowed when the commissioners passed a statement called &quot;Membership, Ministry and Human Sexuality&quot; that stated &quot;all persons, regardless of sexual orientation, who profess their faith in Jesus Christ are welcome to be or become members of The United Church of Canada&quot; and that &quot;all members of the United Church are eligible to be considered for ordered ministry.&quot; Taken together, these two statements opened the door for openly gay men and women to join the ministry. Many members opposed this, and over the next four years, membership fell by 78,184. In some cases, entire congregations split, with a sizeable faction—sometimes led by the minister—leaving to form an independent church. Some of those opposed to the gay ordination issue chose to stay in the church, and formed the &quot;Community of Concern&quot;, a voice of conservatism within the church.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, the United Church faced the legacy of cultural assimilation and child abuse in the residential schools that it had once helped to operate.

On May 24, 1992, Tim Stevenson was the first openly gay minister ordained by the United Church of Canada.

On August 17, 1992, the first Native Canadian (First Nations) Moderator, the Reverend Stan McKay, a Cree man, was elected at the 34th General Council. Two years later, the church established a &quot;Healing Fund&quot;. This was followed in 1998 by an apology made by the church to former students of United Church Indian Residential Schools.

At the 35th General Council in 1994, commissioners voted to have General Councils every three years rather than every two years. This also increased the length of term of Moderators from two to three years.

The original General Council office of the church built in 1925 resided on increasingly valuable land on St. Clair Avenue in downtown Toronto, Ontario. In 1995, facing increasing financial pressure from falling donations, the church sold the building and moved out to the suburb of Etobicoke.

In 1996, a new hymnary, &quot;Voices United&quot;, replaced the joint United-Anglican &quot;The Hymn Book&quot;. Response from congregations was enthusiastic, and by 2010, over 300,000 copies had been printed.

In 1996, the Committee on Archives and History compiled the &quot;Guide to family history research in the archival repositories of the United Church of Canada&quot;.

In 1997, the Reverend Bill Phipps was elected Moderator at the 36th General Council. Controversy again descended on the church when later the same year, Phipps stated in an interview that &#x27;I don&#x27;t believe Jesus was God&#x27; and that he did not believe that Jesus physically rose from the dead.

===2000s===
In the new century, membership and givings both continued to drop, and in 2001 the General Council offices were reorganized as a cost-cutting measure.

In 2005, the church urged the Canadian Parliament to vote in favour of same-sex marriage legislation; after the legislation had been passed, the church urged the government not to reopen the issue.

In 2006, the 39th General Council approved the use of a generous bequest to start up &quot;Emerging Spirit&quot;, a promotional campaign aimed at drawing 30- to 40-year-olds into a conversation about faith. As part of this campaign, &quot;Emerging Spirit&quot; used controversial magazine advertisements featuring, among other images, a bobble-head Jesus, a marriage cake with two grooms holding hands, Jesus sitting on Santa&#x27;s chair in a mall, and a can of whipped cream with the caption &quot;How much fun can sex be before it&#x27;s a sin?&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2012, the 41st General Council elected Gary Paterson as the first openly gay Moderator. The commissioners also voted to invite First Nations peoples to become signatories to the Basis of Union. (In 1925, several aboriginal congregations of the original founding churches were automatically made part of the new United Church although the congregations had not been asked to participate in church Union negotiations, and had not been asked to sign the Basis of Union document.) In addition, the original church crest (adopted in 1944 with French added in 1980) was modified by changing the background colours of the four quadrants of the crest, as well as adding the Mohawk phrase &quot;Akwe Nia&#x27;Tetewá:neren&quot; (&quot;All my relations&quot;) to the crest&#x27;s perimeter.

After much debate, Commissioners also voted to adopt the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Israel/Palestine Policy, which included a boycott of products from Israeli settlements and a campaign of &quot;encouraging members of the United Church to avoid any and all products produced in the settlements.&quot; This was the church&#x27;s first boycott since an anti-apartheid boycott against South Africa in the 1980s. According to the report, the authors consulted with Canadian-based Palestinian organizations, as well as &quot;Jewish rabbis, individuals and organizations&quot; among others. Still it incited controversy, with several groups campaigning against the decision, including protests of the decision by several Canadian Jewish groups.

In 2015, at the 42nd General Council, delegates voted in favour of several &quot;denomination-changing&quot; proposals, including a reorganization from a four-court structure to a three-council structure; elimination of &quot;settlement&quot;, the practice of telling newly ordained ministers where they would first serve; reorganization of the process of finding and training ministers; and a new funding model. These changes were subsequently approved by the wider church, and ratified at the 43rd General Council in July 2018.

In 2015, a debate emerged regarding whether or not United Church minister Gretta Vosper, an avowed atheist, was suitable for ministry. The United Church instituted an ecclesiastical hearing that could have led to her dismissal as minister. However, in 2018, Vosper and Toronto Conference reached a settlement in which all outstanding matters were resolved. Vosper continues to serve at West Hill United Church. In response to this internal decision, the offices of the General Council released a statement saying, &quot;This [decision] doesn&#x27;t alter in any way the belief of the United Church of Canada in God, a God most fully revealed to us as Christians in and through Jesus Christ. Our church&#x27;s statements of faith over the years have all been grounded in this understanding.&quot; A survey of 1,353 &quot;United Church ministry personnel&quot; published by the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; found that &quot;a majority of the respondents (almost 95%) affirmed a belief in God, with a large number (almost 80%) affirming a belief in a supernatural, theistic God&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
In May 2022, Kindred Works, a real estate company, was started in association with the United Church. Kindred Works operates as the asset manager for the United Property Resource Corporation, which is owned by the United Church and tasked with getting positive social utility from church property. Kindred Works aims to renovate existing United Church properties by adding rental units sufficient to house 34,000 people over 15 years. One-third of the new company&#x27;s projects are planned as below-market rental properties partially financed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. All projects will have KPMB Architects as lead designers. At it launch, it had eight projects in progress, four of which, including the St. Luke&#x27;s United Church are in Toronto, with twenty projected to be started by the end of the year.

==Involvement in the Canadian Indian residential school system==
From 1925 until 1969, the United Church operated both residential and daytime institutions of the Canadian Indian residential school system, which mistreated and abused Indigenous children, including cases of murder, malnutrition, sub-standard health care and sexual abuse. Under the Canadian &quot;Indian Act&quot;, the system took Indigenous children from their families, placing them in the legal guardianship of the Church. At its boarding and day schools, the curriculum&#x27;s purpose was to convert them to &quot;civilized people&quot;. Indigenous languages and customs were banned, and many children were not allowed to see their families. The residential school system has resulted in a painful legacy for many Indigenous people and their communities. Of approximately 80,000 students alive as of 2009, about 10 percent attended United Church-run schools. The Church and its predecessors received grants of Indigenous lands to use for the schools and other purposes. It often later sold them for its own profit.

The United Church&#x27;s involvement began in 1925 when it assumed responsibility for 12 native residential schools already operated by its predecessor churches. In 1949, the church began to close the schools in its care. The last residential school under United Church stewardship closed in 1969.

For many years, the Church denied any wrongdoing and protected its members who had committed abuses and punished those who wanted to promote reconciliation. In one notable case in the early 1990s, Kevin Annett, a minister at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in Port Alberni, British Columbia, attempted to reconcile his parish with the survivors of the Port Alberni Residential School. The United Church removed him as minister and eventually defrocked him from the Church.

In 1986, the first apology for residential schools by any institution in Canada was from the United Church of Canada in Sudbury, Ontario. At the 1986 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and adopted the apology. Rev. Bob Smith stated:

We imposed our civilization as a condition of accepting the gospel. We tried to make you be like us and in so doing we helped to destroy the vision that made you what you were. As a result, you, and we, are poorer and the image of the Creator in us is twisted, blurred, and we are not what we are meant by God to be. We ask you to forgive us and to walk together with us in the Spirit of Christ so that our peoples may be blessed and God&#x27;s creation healed.

The elders present at the General Council expressly refused to accept the apology and chose to receive the apology, believing further work needed to be done. Later, in the 1990s, the United Church of Canada issued multiple apologies for its complicity in the structurally abusive program of genocide:

In 2005, the church welcomed the Agreement in Principle announced by the Government of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, which outlined a comprehensive resolution package for former students of Indian Residential Schools; and the following year, the church agreed to sign the &quot;Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement&quot;.

In 2019, the United Church of Canada allocated (of the previous year&#x27;s in donations) to initiatives aimed at ameliorating the persisting consequences of the government-sponsored, church-operated residential school system for Canada&#x27;s indigenous communities.

==Governance and structure==
The rules for governance are set out in &quot;The Manual&quot;, first written in 1925, and updated on a regular basis.

===Moderator===

The voice and face of the church is the Moderator, who is elected to a three-year term at each General Council. The duties of the Moderator include:
* giving leadership to the church; &quot;quickening in the hearts of the people a sense of God as revealed in Christ, and heartening and strengthening the whole United Church&quot;.
* visiting communities of faith across the country; &quot;giving sympathetic guidance and counsel in all its affairs&quot;.
* being the primary spokesperson for the United Church
* presiding at the meetings of the denominational council, its Executive, and its Sub-Executive.

Currently, the Carmen Lansdowne holds the position following her election at the 44th General Council in August 2022.

===Governance structure===

For the first 92 years of its existence, administration was shared among four courts, or levels:
* pastoral charges, the primary ministry unit of the United Church, were composed of one or more congregations or preaching points. 
* pastoral charges were members of local area presbyteries or districts, of which there were 88. 
* presbyteries were gathered into regional conferences, of which there were 13. 
*General Council, the church&#x27;s highest legislative court, was elected and met every three years.

In 2019 the church moved to a three-council model: 
* communities of faith, which will include all pastoral charges, congregations, and other groups who gather regularly for worship. 
* regional councils, of which there will be 16. 
* denominational council, which will continue to be referred to as the &quot;General Council.&quot;

===Ministry===
The clergy of the United Church are called &quot;ministers&quot;. There are two &quot;streams&quot;, &quot;ordered ministry&quot; and &quot;lay ministry&quot;. Ordered ministry includes &quot;ordained&quot; ministers and &quot;diaconal&quot; ministers. Lay ministry refers to &quot;licensed lay worship leaders&quot;, &quot;designated lay ministers&quot; (DLM), &quot;sacraments elders&quot; and &quot;congregational designated ministers&quot; (CDM). There are no restrictions on gender, sexual orientation, age, or marital status for any branches of ministry.

==Beliefs and practices==

===Bible===
The United Church believes that the Bible is central to the Christian faith and was written by people who were inspired by God. The church also believes that the circumstances under which the books of the Bible were written were of a particular place and time, and some things cannot be reconciled with our lives today, such as slavery and the condemnation of homosexuality. The United Church of Canada uses the historical-critical method of interpreting the bible.

===Sacraments===
The two sacraments of the United Church are Communion and Baptism.

====Communion====
Communion is the ritual sharing of the elements of bread and wine (or, more commonly, grape juice) as a remembrance of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his followers. It is usually celebrated at a table at the front of the sanctuary, where the minister blesses the elements before they are distributed to the congregation. The Church practises open communion, with no restriction regarding age or membership, as the sacrament is open to young children and Christians from other denominations.

The actual distribution can take several forms, including passing a tray of bread cubes and another tray of small juice glasses from person to person, and then eating the bread and drinking the juice in unison; and &quot;intinction&quot;, where each person takes a piece of bread, dips it into a cup of juice and then eats the juice-soaked bread.

There is no guideline for frequency. Some congregations celebrate communion once a month, others on a quarterly basis.

====Baptism====
Baptism is the first step in church membership, where the parents make a profession of faith on behalf of the infant in the hope that their child will later confirm that profession at or around the age of 13.

The United Church practices infant baptism, but in cases where a person was not baptized as an infant, baptism can be performed at any age. In the case of infant baptism, the parents of the infant, before the congregation, agree to a series of statements about the beliefs of the United Church on behalf of their child. They also promise to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time. The members of the congregation also promise the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community. The minister then places water on the candidate&#x27;s head three times (expressing the Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and traces a cross on the person&#x27;s forehead with water. Baptism by immersion is also an option for adults who request it.

In the 1970s, the United Church reached an ecumenical agreement with the Presbyterian, Lutheran, Catholic, and Anglican churches in Canada that baptisms within these churches are mutually recognized as valid. Further to that, the United Church recognizes the validity of any baptism by another denomination that was performed with water and in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

===Inclusiveness===
The church attempts to welcome everyone, regardless of age, race, class, gender, sexual orientation, or physical ability. In the same manner, there is also no restriction on those interested in entering ministry.

===Marriage===
The United Church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages, including same-sex couples, previously divorced people, and couples of different religions. The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each community of faith. For instance, one congregation might not allow same-sex marriages to be performed in their building, while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation.

===Interfaith relations===
The church believes that there are many paths to God. The United Church&#x27;s path is through Jesus Christ, but the church also recognizes that Christians&#x27; understanding of this is limited by an incomplete comprehension of God; their belief is that the Holy Spirit is also at work through other non-Christian faiths.

===Abortion===
The church supports the right of women to have access to safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care, but also supports better access to contraception, sexual education, and counselling that might eventually make abortion unnecessary.

==Membership==
A full member is one who has been baptised, either as infant, child, youth or adult, and has made a public profession of faith before the congregation. Membership is not required in order to worship at a United Church, and many who regularly attend worship are adherents rather than members.

In order to become a full member, a person goes through a process called &quot;confirmation&quot;. This is offered to adults (starting at around age 13) and usually involves a series of classes about the beliefs of the United Church. Following this, the candidate makes a public profession of faith before the congregation, thereby &quot;confirming&quot; the statements made by his or her parents during baptism. If the person is unbaptised, the minister baptises the person before the profession of faith. The new member&#x27;s name is then entered on the official Roll of Members for that congregation.

===Benefits of membership===
Only members can be a part of a congregation&#x27;s board or council, and only members can vote at congregational meetings, although members can vote to extend voting privileges to adherents.

===Transfer of membership and removal from rolls===
Although confirmation takes place at the congregational level, the person is a member of the entire United Church of Canada, not just one congregation; therefore membership can be transferred freely from congregation to congregation.

A congregation may remove members from its roll for non-attendance. (&quot;The Manual&quot; suggests an absence of three years, but the congregation is free to set its own period of time)

==Music==
The United Church has issued four hymn books:
* &quot;Hymnary&quot; (1930)
*&quot;The Hymn Book&quot; (jointly with the Anglican Church of Canada) in 1971
*&quot;Voices United&quot; (1996) is the current hymnal, with over 300,000 copies in print. A supplement, &quot;More Voices&quot; was published in 2006
* &quot;Nos voix unies&quot; (2005), the United Church&#x27;s first French-language hymnal

==Criticism from outside the church==
A. C. Forrest, the editor of the &quot;United Church Observer&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s (and by extension the United Church itself) came under strong attack from the Canadian Jewish community for frequent editorial espousal of Palestinian rights in Israel, on the West Bank and in Gaza; many within the United Church were also uncomfortable with Forrest&#x27;s position, though ultimately the church adjudged a plurality of opinion on this (and other matters) as consistent with United Church open-mindedness.

The &quot;National Post&quot; has published several articles critical of the United Church of Canada. (August 19, 2009: &quot;United Church is blind to true suffering&quot;; August 14, 2009: &quot;United Church&#x27;s uncertain future&quot;) An article by Charles Lewis, published on May 14, 2011, set out what Lewis sees as the issues that beset the United Church: the church&#x27;s &quot;big tent&quot; approach to believers, accepting even atheists as members; and lack of doctrinal orthodoxy.

<text>St. Paul&#x27;s-Eastern United Church is one of the oldest in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The stone Romanesque church building is located in the heart of downtown Ottawa (Sandy Hill) on the corner of Daly and Cumberland Streets, near the University of Ottawa and two blocks east of the Rideau Centre.

== History ==
The Romanesque Revival structure was built from 1888 to 1889 for St. Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church by S.R. Badgley, architect. It originally had a large steeple. Unfortunately the church was built on sand, and the steeple side started sinking into the ground. The steeple was therefore removed early in the 20th century, leaving the building as a relatively squat stone structure.

With the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925, St. Paul&#x27;s merged with the nearby Eastern Methodist Church and got its current name.

In the late part of the 20th century the church struggled. The growing secularization of Canadian society and the smaller number of people living downtown meant that the church was rarely more than half full and the Sunday school had only a handful of children.

The church closed in 2021 following the covid crisis and the congregation disbanded. 

== St. Paul&#x27;s today ==
More recently (2003–present), the church has experienced a revitalization in activity, membership, finances and Sunday School involvement. Most of the new people coming to St. Paul&#x27;s-Eastern are young families and young singles.

St. Paul&#x27;s-Eastern has a number of groups and partners who operate out of the church. They include: Jericho Road and Touch of Love. Other groups such as Girl Guides and Alcoholics Anonymous also operate out of the church.

The church closed in 2021 following the covid crisis and the congregation disbanded.

<text>A planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar bodies in or out of orbit around a star or star system. Generally speaking, systems with one or more planets constitute a planetary system, although such systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets, planetesimals and circumstellar disks. For example, the Sun together with the planetary system revolving around it, including Earth, form the Solar System. The term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to other planetary systems.

 Debris disks are known to be common while other objects are more difficult to observe.

Of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems where planets could have surface liquid water, and thus, the capacity to support Earth-like life.

==History==

===Heliocentrism===
Heliocentrism is the doctrine that the Sun is at the centre of the universe, as opposed to geocentrism (placing Earth at the centre of the universe).

Some interpret Aryabhatta&#x27;s writings in Āryabhaṭīya as implicitly heliocentric although this has also been rebutted.

The idea was first proposed in Western philosophy and Greek astronomy as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but received no support from most other ancient astronomers.

===Discovery of the Solar System===
&quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; by Nicolaus Copernicus, published in 1543, presented the first mathematically predictive heliocentric model of a planetary system. 17th-century successors Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Sir Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics which led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that the Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth.

===Speculation on extrasolar planetary systems===
In the 16th century the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets. He was burned at the stake for his ideas by the Roman Inquisition.

In the 18th century, the same possibility was mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton in the &quot;General Scholium&quot; that concludes his &quot;Principia&quot;. Making a comparison to the Sun&#x27;s planets, he wrote &quot;And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of &quot;One&quot;.&quot;

His theories gained popularity through the 19th and 20th centuries despite a lack of supporting evidence. Long before their confirmation by astronomers, conjecture on the nature of planetary systems had been a focus of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and has been a prevalent theme in fiction, particularly science fiction.

===Detection of exoplanets===
The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmed detection of exoplanets of a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet, 51 Pegasi b, was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby G-type star 51 Pegasi. The frequency of detections has increased since then, particularly through advancements in methods of detecting extrasolar planets and dedicated planet-finding programs such as the Kepler mission.

==Origin and evolution==
Planetary systems come from protoplanetary disks that form around stars as part of the process of star formation.

During formation of a system, much material is gravitationally-scattered into distant orbits, and some planets are ejected completely from the system, becoming rogue planets.

===Evolved systems===

====High-mass stars====
Planets orbiting pulsars have been discovered. Pulsars are the remnants of the supernova explosions of high-mass stars, but a planetary system that existed before the supernova would likely be mostly destroyed. Planets would either evaporate, be pushed off of their orbits by the masses of gas from the exploding star, or the sudden loss of most of the mass of the central star would see them escape the gravitational hold of the star, or in some cases the supernova would kick the pulsar itself out of the system at high velocity so any planets that had survived the explosion would be left behind as free-floating objects. Planets found around pulsars may have formed as a result of pre-existing stellar companions that were almost entirely evaporated by the supernova blast, leaving behind planet-sized bodies. Alternatively, planets may form in an accretion disk of fallback matter surrounding a pulsar. Fallback disks of matter that failed to escape orbit during a supernova may also form planets around black holes.

====Lower-mass stars====

As stars evolve and turn into red giants, asymptotic giant branch stars, and planetary nebulae they engulf the inner planets, evaporating or partially evaporating them depending on how massive they are. As the star loses mass, planets that are not engulfed move further out from the star.

If an evolved star is in a binary or multiple system, then the mass it loses can transfer to another star, forming new protoplanetary disks and second- and third-generation planets which may differ in composition from the original planets, which may also be affected by the mass transfer.

==System architectures==
The Solar System consists of an inner region of small rocky planets and outer region of large giant planets. However, other planetary systems can have quite different architectures. Studies suggest that architectures of planetary systems are dependent on the conditions of their initial formation. Many systems with a hot Jupiter gas giant very close to the star have been found. Theories, such as planetary migration or scattering, have been proposed for the formation of large planets close to their parent stars.
At present, few systems have been found to be analogous to the Solar System with small terrestrial planets in the inner region, as well as a gas giant with a relatively circular orbit, which suggests that this configuration is uncommon. More commonly, systems consisting of multiple Super-Earths have been detected. These super-Earths are usually very close to their star, with orbits smaller than that of Mercury.

===Classification===
Planetary system architectures may be partitioned into four classes based on how the mass of the planets is distributed around the host star:

* Similar: The masses of all planets in a system are similar to each other. This architecture class is the most commonly-observed in our galaxy. Examples include Trappist-1. The planets in these systems are said to be like &#x27;peas in a pod&#x27;.
* Mixed: The masses of planets in a system show large increasing or decreasing variations. Examples of such systems are Gliese 876 and Kepler-89.
* Anti-Ordered: The massive planets of a system are close to the star and smaller planets are further away from the star. There are currently no known examples of this architecture class.
* Ordered: The mass of the planets in a system tends to increase with increasing distance from the host star. The Solar System, with small rocky planets in the inner part and giant planets in the outer part, is a type of Ordered system.

===Peas in a pod===
Multiplanetary systems tend to be in a &quot;peas in a pod&quot; configuration meaning they tend to have the following factors:
* Size: planets within a system tend to be either similar or ordered in size.
* Mass: planets within a system tend to be either similar or ordered in mass.
* Spacing: planets within a system tend to be equally spaced apart.
* Packing: small planets tend to be closely packed together, while large planets tend to have larger spacing.

===Components===

====Planets and stars====

Most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the Sun: that is, main-sequence stars of spectral categories F, G, or K. One reason is that planet-search programs have tended to concentrate on such stars. In addition, statistical analyses indicate that lower-mass stars (red dwarfs, of spectral category M) are less likely to have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method. Nevertheless, several tens of planets around red dwarfs have been discovered by the Kepler space telescope by the transit method, which can detect smaller planets.

====Circumstellar disks and dust structures====
After planets, circumstellar disks are one of the most commonly-observed properties of planetary systems, particularly of young stars. The Solar System possesses at least four major circumstellar disks (the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and Oort cloud) and clearly-observable disks have been detected around nearby solar analogs including Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. Based on observations of numerous similar disks, they are assumed to be quite common attributes of stars on the main sequence.

Interplanetary dust clouds have been studied in the Solar System and analogs are believed to be present in other planetary systems. Exozodiacal dust, an exoplanetary analog of zodiacal dust, the 1–100 micrometre-sized grains of amorphous carbon and silicate dust that fill the plane of the Solar System has been detected around the 51 Ophiuchi, Fomalhaut,&lt;ref name=&quot;VLTI/PIONIER&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tau Ceti, and Vega systems.

====Comets====

 there are 5,253 known Solar System comets and they are thought to be common components of planetary systems. The first exocomets were detected in 1987 around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star. There are now a total of 11 stars around which the presence of exocomets have been observed or suspected. All discovered exocometary systems (Beta Pictoris, HR 10, 51 Ophiuchi, HR 2174, 49 Ceti, 5 Vulpeculae, 2 Andromedae, HD 21620, HD 42111, HD 110411, and more recently HD 172555) are around very young A-type stars.

====Other components====

Computer modelling of an impact in 2013 detected around the star NGC 2547-ID8 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, and confirmed by ground observations, suggests the involvement of large asteroids or protoplanets similar to the events believed to have led to the formation of terrestrial planets like the Earth.

Based on observations of the Solar System&#x27;s large collection of natural satellites, they are believed common components of planetary systems; however, the existence of exomoons has not yet been confirmed. The star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6, in the constellation Centaurus, is a strong candidate for a natural satellite. Indications suggest that the confirmed extrasolar planet WASP-12b also has at least one satellite.

===Orbital configurations===
Unlike the Solar System, which has orbits that are nearly circular, many of the known planetary systems display much higher orbital eccentricity. An example of such a system is 16 Cygni.

====Mutual inclination====
The mutual inclination between two planets is the angle between their orbital planes. Many compact systems with multiple close-in planets interior to the equivalent orbit of Venus are expected to have very low mutual inclinations, so the system (at least the close-in part) would be even flatter than the Solar System. Captured planets could be captured into any arbitrary angle to the rest of the system. there are only a few systems where mutual inclinations have actually been measured One example is the Upsilon Andromedae system: the planets c and d have a mutual inclination of about 30 degrees.

====Orbital dynamics====
Planetary systems can be categorized according to their orbital dynamics as resonant, non-resonant-interacting, hierarchical, or some combination of these. In resonant systems the orbital periods of the planets are in integer ratios. The Kepler-223 system contains four planets in an 8:6:4:3 orbital resonance.
Giant planets are found in mean-motion resonances more often than smaller planets.
In interacting systems the planets&#x27; orbits are close enough together that they perturb the orbital parameters. The Solar System could be described as weakly interacting. In strongly interacting systems Kepler&#x27;s laws do not hold.
In hierarchical systems the planets are arranged so that the system can be gravitationally considered as a nested system of two-bodies, e.g. in a star with a close-in hot Jupiter with another gas giant much further out, the star and hot Jupiter form a pair that appears as a single object to another planet that is far enough out.

Other, as yet unobserved, orbital possibilities include: double planets; various co-orbital planets such as quasi-satellites, trojans and exchange orbits; and interlocking orbits maintained by precessing orbital planes.

====Planet capture====
Free-floating planets in open clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system. Some planet–host metallicity correlation may still exist due to the common origin of the stars from the same cluster. Planets would be unlikely to be captured around neutron stars because these are likely to be ejected from the cluster by a pulsar kick when they form. Planets could even be captured around other planets to form free-floating planet binaries. After the cluster has dispersed some of the captured planets with orbits larger than 106 AU would be slowly disrupted by the galactic tide and likely become free-floating again through encounters with other field stars or giant molecular clouds.

==Zones==

===Habitable zone===
The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature range allows for liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star; this means the habitable zone will also vary accordingly. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet&#x27;s ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet.

Habitable zones have usually been defined in terms of surface temperature; however, over half of Earth&#x27;s biomass is from subsurface microbes, and temperature increases as depth underground increases, so the subsurface can be conducive for life when the surface is frozen; if this is considered, the habitable zone extends much further from the star.

Studies in 2013 indicate that an estimated 22±8% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone.

===Venus zone===
The Venus zone is the region around a star where a terrestrial planet would have runaway greenhouse conditions like Venus, but not so near the star that the atmosphere completely escapes. As with the habitable zone, the location of the Venus zone depends on several factors, including the type of star and properties of the planets such as mass, rotation rate, and atmospheric clouds. Studies of the Kepler spacecraft data indicate that 32% of red dwarfs have potentially Venus-like planets based on planet size and distance from star, increasing to 45% for K-type and G-type stars. Several candidates have been identified, but spectroscopic follow-up studies of their atmospheres are required to determine whether they are like Venus.

==Galactic distribution of planets==
The Milky Way is 100,000 light-years across, but 90% of planets with known distances are within about 2000 light years of Earth, as of July 2014. One method that can detect planets much further away is microlensing. The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could use microlensing to measure the relative frequency of planets in the galactic bulge versus the galactic disk. So far, the indications are that planets are more common in the disk than the bulge. Estimates of the distance of microlensing events is difficult: the first planet considered with high probability of being in the bulge is MOA-2011-BLG-293Lb at a distance of 7.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 light years).
&quot;Population I&quot;, or &quot;metal-rich stars&quot;, are those young stars whose metallicity is highest. The high metallicity of population I stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than older populations, because planets form by the accretion of metals. The Sun is an example of a metal-rich star. These are common in the spiral arms of the Milky Way. Generally, the youngest stars, the extreme population I, are found farther in and intermediate population I stars are farther out, etc. The Sun is considered an intermediate population I star. Population I stars have regular elliptical orbits around the Galactic Center, with a low relative velocity.

&quot;Population II&quot;, or &quot;metal-poor stars&quot;, are those with relatively low metallicity which can have hundreds (e.g. BD +17° 3248) or thousands (e.g. Sneden&#x27;s Star) times less metallicity than the Sun. These objects formed during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate population II stars are common in the bulge near the center of the Milky Way, whereas Population II stars found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters also contain high numbers of population II stars.
In 2014, the first planets around a halo star were announced around Kapteyn&#x27;s star, the nearest halo star to Earth, around 13 light years away. However, later research suggests that Kapteyn b is just an artefact of stellar activity and that Kapteyn c needs more study to be confirmed. The metallicity of Kapteyn&#x27;s star is estimated to be about 8 times less than the Sun.

Different types of galaxies have different histories of star formation and hence planet formation. Planet formation is affected by the ages, metallicities, and orbits of stellar populations within a galaxy. Distribution of stellar populations within a galaxy varies between the different types of galaxies.
Stars in elliptical galaxies are much older than stars in spiral galaxies. Most elliptical galaxies contain mainly low-mass stars, with minimal star-formation activity. The distribution of the different types of galaxies in the universe depends on their location within galaxy clusters, with elliptical galaxies found mostly close to their centers.

<text>Cremona (, ; ; ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in northern Italy, situated in Lombardy, on the left bank of the Po river in the middle of the &quot;Pianura Padana&quot; (Po Valley). It is the capital of the province of Cremona and the seat of the local city and province governments. The city of Cremona is especially noted for its musical history and traditions, including some of the earliest and most renowned luthiers, such as Giuseppe Guarneri, Antonio Stradivari, Francesco Rugeri, Vincenzo Rugeri, and several members of the Amati family.

==History==
===Ancient===
====Celtic origin====
Cremona is first mentioned in history as a settlement of the Cenomani, a Gallic (Celtic) tribe that arrived in the Po valley around 400 BC. However, the name Cremona most likely dates back to earlier settlers and puzzled the ancients, who gave many fanciful interpretations.

====Roman military outpost====
In 218 BC the Romans established on that spot their first military outpost (a ) north of the Po river, and kept the old name. Cremona and nearby Placentia (modern Piacenza, on the south bank of the Po), were founded in the same year, as bases for penetration into what became the Roman Province of &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; (Cisalpine Gaul). Due to the trade importance of the town, from it started the Via Brixiana a Roman road which connected &quot;Brixia&quot; (Brescia) to Cremona. 

Cremona quickly grew into one of the largest towns in northern Italy, as it was on the main road connecting Genoa to Aquileia, the Via Postumia. It supplied troops to Julius Caesar and benefited from his rule, but later supported Marcus Iunius Brutus and the Senate in their conflict with Augustus, who, having won, in 40 BC confiscated Cremona&#x27;s land and redistributed it to his men. The famous poet Virgil, who went to school in Cremona, had to forfeit his ancestral farm (&quot;too close to wretched Cremona&quot;), but later regained it.

====Destruction====
The city&#x27;s prosperity continued to increase until 69 AD, when it was sacked and destroyed in the Second Battle of Bedriacum by the troops of Vespasian under command of Marcus Antonius Primus, fighting to install him as Emperor against his rival Vitellius. The sacking was described by Tacitus in Histories. 

Cremona was rebuilt with the help of the new emperor Vespasian, but it seems to have failed to regain its former prosperity as it disappeared from history.

====Re-emergence====
In the 6th century, it resurfaced as a military outpost of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire during the Gothic War.

===Early Middle Ages===
When the Lombards invaded much of Italy in the second half of the 6th century AD, Cremona remained a Byzantine stronghold as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna. The city expanded towards the north-west, with the creation of a great trenched camp outside the walls.

====Lombard Possession====
In 603 AD, Cremona was conquered by the Lombard King Agilulf and again destroyed. Its territory was divided between the two duchies of Brescia and Bergamo.

However, in 615 AD, Queen Theodelinda, a devout Roman Catholic intent on converting her people, had Cremona rebuilt and re-installed a bishop there.

====Holy Roman Vassal====
Control of the city fell increasingly to its bishop, who became a Holy Roman Empire vassal after Charlemagne&#x27;s conquest of Italy. In this way, Cremona increased its power and its prosperity steadily and some of its bishops had important roles between the 10th and 11th centuries. Bishop Liutprand of Cremona was a member of the Imperial court under the Saxony dynasty and Olderic gained strong privileges for his city from emperor Otto III. Its economy was boosted by the creation of a river port out of the former Byzantine fortress.

However, the two bishops Lambert and Ubaldo created discord with the city&#x27;s people. Emperor Conrad II settled the quarrel by entering Cremona in 1037 together with the young Pope Benedict IX.

===Medieval Commune===
Under Henry IV, Cremona refused to pay the oppressive taxes requested by the Empire and the bishop. According to a legend, the great &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; (mayor) Giovanni Baldesio of Cremona faced the emperor himself in a duel. As Henry was knocked from his horse, the city was saved the annual payment of the golden ball, which, for that year, was instead given to Berta, Giovanni&#x27;s girlfriend, as her dowry.

====Anti-Empire====
The first historical news about a free Cremona is from 1093, as it entered into an anti-Empire alliance led by Mathilde of Canossa, together with Lodi, Milan and Piacenza. The conflict ended with Cremona gaining the &quot;Insula Fulcheria&quot;, the area around the nearby city of Crema, as its territory.

After that time, the new commune warred against nearby cities to enlarge its territory. In 1107 Cremona conquered Tortona, but four years later its army was defeated near Bressanoro.

As in many northern Italian cities, the people were divided into two opposing parties, the Guelphs, who were stronger in the &quot;new city&quot;, and the Ghibellines, who had their base in the &quot;old city&quot;. The parties were so irreconcilable that the former built a second Communal Palace, the still existing Palazzo Cittanova (&quot;new city&#x27;s palace&quot;).

====Pro-Empire====
When Frederick Barbarossa descended into Italy to assert his authority, Cremona sided with him in order to gain his support against Crema, which had rebelled with the help of Milan. The subsequent victory and its loyal imperial stance earned Cremona the right to create a mint for its own coinage in 1154. In 1162, Imperial and Cremonese forces assaulted Milan and destroyed it.

====Lombard League====
However, in 1167 the city changed sides and joined the Lombard League. Its troops were part of the army that, on 29 May 1176, defeated Barbarossa in the Battle of Legnano. However, the Lombard League did not survive this victory for long. In 1213, at Castelleone, the Cremonese defeated the League of Milan, Lodi, Crema, Novara, Como and Brescia.

In 1232, Cremona allied itself with Emperor Frederick II, who was again trying to reassert the Empire&#x27;s authority over Northern Italy. In the Battle of Cortenuova, the Cremonese were on the winning side. Thereafter Frederick often held his court in the city.

In the Battle of Parma, however, the Ghibellines suffered a heavy defeat and up to two thousand Cremonese were made prisoners. Some years later, Cremona took its vengeance by defeating Parma&#x27;s army. Its army, under the command of Umberto Pallavicino, captured Parma&#x27;s carroccio and for centuries kept the enemy&#x27;s trousers hanging from the Cathedral&#x27;s ceiling as a sign of the rival&#x27;s humiliation.

In 1301 the troubadour Luchetto Gattilusio was of Cremona. During this period Cremona flourished and reached a population of up to 80,000, larger than the 69,000 of 2001.

===Seignory Lords===
In 1266, Pallavicino was expelled from Cremona, and the Ghibelline rule ended after his successor Buoso da Dovara relinquished control to a consortium of citizens. In 1271 the position of &quot;Capitano del Popolo&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Chieftain&quot;) was created.

In 1276 the Signoria passed to marquis Cavalcabò Cavalcabò; in 1305 he was succeeded by his son Guglielmo Cavalcabò, who held power until 1310. During this period many edifices were created or restored including the belfry of the Torrazzo, the Romanesque church of San Francis, the cathedral&#x27;s transepts and the Loggia dei Militi. Moreover, agriculture was boosted with a new network of canals.

After some foreign invasions (notably that of Emperor Henry VII in 1311), the Cavalcabò lasted until 29 November 1322, when a more powerful family, the Visconti of Galeazzo I, came to prominence that in Cremona was to last for a century and a half. The Visconti&#x27;s signoria (lordship) was interrupted in 1327 by Ludwig the Bavarian, in 1331 by John of Bohemia, and in 1403 by a short-lived return of the Cavalcabò. On 25 July 1406, captain Cabrino Fondulo killed his employer Ubaldo Cavalcabò along with all the male members of his family, and assumed control over Cremona. However, he was unable to face the task, and ceded the city back to the Visconti for a payment of 40,000 golden florins.

Thus Filippo Maria Visconti made his signoria hereditary. Cremona became part of the Duchy of Milan, following its fate until the unification of Italy. Under the Visconti and later the Sforza, Cremona underwent high cultural and religious development. In 1411 Palazzo Cittanova become the seat of the university of fustian merchants.

In 1441 the city hosted the marriage of Francesco I Sforza and Bianca Maria Visconti in the temple built by the Benedictines, which today is the church of Saint Sigismund. For that occasion a new sweet was devised, which evolved into the famous torrone. Ludovico il Moro assisted in the financing of several building projects for the cathedral, the church of St. Agatha and the Communal Palace.

In 1446, Cremona was encircled by the condottieri troops of Francesco Piccinino and Luigi dal Verme. The siege was raised after the arrival of Scaramuccia da Forlì from Venice.

===Foreign occupations===
====Republic of Venice====
From 1499 to 1509 Cremona was under Venetian control.

The victory of the Italian League at Agnadello gave it back to the Duchy of Milan.

====Spain====
However, Cremona was assigned to Spain under the Treaty of Noyon (1513). Cremona fell to the new rulers only in 1524 when the Castle of Santa Croce surrendered. The French were finally expelled from the duchy two years later, with the Treaty of Madrid, and subsequently Cremona remained a Spanish dominion for many years. During that time several building improvements or additions were made, including the Loggia of the cathedral&#x27;s Porch by Lorenzo Trotti (1550) and the new church of San Siro and Sepolcro by Antonio Gialdini (1614).

During Spanish rule, Cremona saw the famine of 1628 and the plague of 1630.

====Austria====
The duchy, after a short-lived French conquest in 1701 during the War of the Spanish Succession, passed to Austria on 10 April 1707.

==Economy==
The economy of Cremona is deeply linked to the agricultural production of the countryside. Food industries include salted meat, sweets (torrone), vegetable oils, grana padano, provolone and &quot;mostarda&quot; (candied fruit in spicy mustard-flavored syrup, served with meats and cheese). Heavy industries include steel, oil and one electric plant. The river-port is a base for the barges transporting goods along the Po river.

==Music==
Cremona has a distinguished musical history. The 12th-century cathedral was a focus of organized musical activity in the region in the late Middle Ages. By the 16th century the town had become a famous musical centre. Nowadays there are important &quot;ensembles&quot; for Renaissance and Baroque music, i.e. Choir &amp; Consort &quot;Costanzo Porta&quot;, and festivals which maintain Cremona as one of the most important towns in Italy for music. Composer Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri taught there; Claudio Monteverdi was his most famous student, before leaving for Mantua in 1591. Cremona was the birthplace of Pierre-Francisque Caroubel, a collaborator with noted German composer Michael Praetorius. The bishop of Cremona, Nicolò Sfondrati, a fervent supporter of the Counter-Reformation, became Pope Gregory XIV in 1590. Since he was an equally fervent patron of music, the renown of the town as a musical destination grew accordingly.

Beginning in the 16th century, Cremona became renowned as a centre of musical instrument manufacture, with the violins of the Amati and Rugeri families, and later the products of the Guarneri and Stradivari workshops. To the present day, their handmade work is widely considered to be the summit of achievement in string instrument making. Cremona is still renowned for producing high-quality instruments, rare examples of which can be seen when visiting the local Museo del Violino. In 2012 the &quot;Traditional violin craftsmanship in Cremona&quot; was declared an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO. Internationally, the city&#x27;s craftsmen are renowned for the unique process used in crafting bowed stringed instruments which are assembled and moulded by hand without using any industrial materials.

Cremona had a band tradition linked to the &quot;Guardia nazionale&quot; founded under Napoleonic influence. In 1864, native son Amilcare Ponchielli became its leader and created what might be considered one of the greatest bands of all time. In his role as &quot;capobanda&quot;, Ponchielli founded a band school and a tradition that waned only at the onset of World War I.

==Transport==
Cremona railway station, opened in 1863, is a terminus of six railway lines, all of which are regional (semi-fast) or local services.

Main destinations are Pavia, Mantua, Milan, Treviglio, Parma, Brescia, Piacenza and Fidenza.

==Sport==
Cremona&#x27;s favourite sport is football. The U.S. Cremonese played for several years in Serie A, its most renowned players being Aristide Guarneri, Emiliano Mondonico, Antonio Cabrini and Gianluca Vialli — all born in or near Cremona. The brightest page in the more than one-century-old history of Cremonese was written in the early 1990s, when the president of the team was Domenico Luzzara and the coach was Gigi Simoni; the team managed to stay in Serie A for three consecutive years, ending one championship at tenth place. By defeating English team Derby County in the Final to win the Anglo-Italian Cup (27 March 1993), Cremonese became the second Italian team in football history to win at Wembley.

Cremona, by the 1980s, had built a strong basketball tradition, now brought on by Vanoli Basket, a team from Soresina which however usually plays in Cremona.

Cremona has also a waterpolo club that play in the regional divisions.
There is a century-old tradition in rowing and canoe racing, with three different clubs, located along the Po river, that trained many world and Olympic champions.

<text>Count , also known as Kiten, Count Nogi GCB (December 25, 1849September 13, 1912), was a Japanese general in the Imperial Japanese Army and a governor-general of Taiwan. He was one of the commanders during the 1894 capture of Port Arthur from China and a prominent figure in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, as commander of the forces which captured Port Arthur from the Russians.

He was a national hero in Imperial Japan as a model of feudal loyalty and self-sacrifice, ultimately to the point of suicide. In the Satsuma Rebellion, he lost a banner of the emperor in battle, for which he tried to atone with suicidal bravery in order to recapture it, until ordered to stop. In the Russo-Japanese War, he captured Port Arthur but he felt that he had lost too many of his soldiers, so requested permission to commit suicide, which the emperor refused. These two events, as well as his desire not to outlive his master, motivated his suicide on the day of the funeral of the Emperor Meiji. His example brought attention to the concept of &quot;bushido&quot; and the controversial samurai practice of &quot;junshi&quot; (following the lord in death).

== Early life ==
Nogi Nakito was born on December 25, 1849, at the Chōfu Domain Mansion in Edo (present-day Roppongi, Tokyo), the third son of samurai cavalry officer (&quot;umamawari&quot;) Nogi Maretsugu and his wife Hisako. His father served the Chōfu Domain, a subsidiary domain of the Chōshū Domain, and held land worth 80 &quot;koku&quot;. His childhood name was Nakito (無人), literally &quot;no one&quot;, to prevent evil spirits from coming to harm him. He was briefly known as Bunzō, after which he was renamed Maresuke. As he claimed descent from the Izumo Minamoto clan through the Sasaki clan, he often used the name Minamoto no Maresuke in his signatures.

== Early military career ==
In November 1869, by the order of the Nagato domain&#x27;s lord, he enlisted in &quot;Fushimi Goshin Heisha&quot; () to be trained in the French style for the domanial Army. After completing the training, he was reassigned to the Kawatō Barrack in Kyoto as an instructor, and then as Toyōra domain&#x27;s Army trainer in charge of coastal defense troops.

In 1871, Nogi was commissioned as a major in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. Around this time, he renamed himself &quot;Maresuke&quot; taking a &quot;kanji&quot; from the name of his father. In 1875, he became the 14th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s attaché. The next year (1876), Nogi was named as the Kumamoto regional troop&#x27;s Staff Officer, and transferred to command the 1st Infantry Regiment, and for his service in the Satsuma Rebellion, against the forces of Saigō Takamori in Kyūshū, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 22, 1877. In a fierce battle at that time, he lost the 14th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s regimental banner, which was considered to be the property of the Emperor, to the enemy. Its loss was an extreme disgrace. Nogi considered this such a grave mistake that he listed it as one of the reasons for his later suicide.

On August 27, 1876, Nogi married Shizuko, the fourth daughter of Satsuma &quot;samurai&quot; Yuji Sadano, who was then 20 years old. As Nogi was 28 years old, it was a very late marriage for that time, considering that the average age to marry was in the early 20s. On August 28, 1877, their first son Katsunori was born, and Nogi bought his first house at Niizakamachi, Akasaka, Tokyo. In 1879, his second son Yasunori was born. He was promoted to colonel on April 29, 1880.

He was posted to Nagoya during the early Meiji era. The warehouse in the Sannomaru enceinte of Nagoya Castle was probably constructed in 1880 (Meiji 13) as an army ammunition depot. It was named later after him.

Promoted major general on May 21, 1885, in 1887 Nogi went to Germany with Kawakami Soroku to study European military strategy and tactics.

In 1894, during the First Sino-Japanese War, Major-General Nogi commanded the First Infantry Brigade which penetrated the Chinese defenses and successfully occupied Port Arthur in only one day of combat. As such, he was a senior commander during the Port Arthur massacre. The following year, he was promoted to lieutenant general (April 29, 1895) and assigned to the Second Division, tasked with the invasion of Taiwan. Nogi remained with the occupation forces in Taiwan until 1898. In 1899, he was recalled to Japan, and placed in command of the newly formed 11th Infantry Brigade, based in Kagawa.

== Political career ==
After the war, he was elevated to &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron); and he was conferred with the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st class.

Nogi was appointed as the third Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan from October 14, 1896, to February 1898. When moving to Taiwan, he moved his entire family, and during their time in Taiwan, his mother contracted malaria and died. This led Nogi to take measures to improve on the health care infrastructure of the island.

However, unlike many of his contemporaries as officers, Nogi expressed no interest in pursuing politics.

== Russo-Japanese War ==

In 1904, Nogi was recalled to active service on the occasion of the Russo-Japanese War, and was promoted to army general in command of the Japanese Third Army, with an initial strength of approximately 90,000 men and assigned to the capture of the Russian-held Port Arthur on the southern tip of Liaodong Peninsula, Manchuria. Nogi&#x27;s forces landed shortly after the Battle of Nanshan, in which his eldest son, serving with the Japanese Second Army, was killed. Advancing slowly down the Liaodong Peninsula, Nogi encountered unexpectedly strong resistance, and far more fortifications than he had experienced ten years earlier against the Chinese.
The attack against Port Arthur quickly turned into the lengthy Siege of Port Arthur, an engagement lasting from August 1, 1904, to January 2, 1905, costing the Japanese massive losses. Due to the mounting casualties and failure of Nogi to overcome Port Arthur&#x27;s defenses, there was mounting pressure within the Japanese government and military to relieve him of command. However, in an unprecedented action, Emperor Meiji spoke out during the Supreme War Council (Japan) meeting, defending Nogi and demanding that he be kept in command.

After the fall of Port Arthur, Nogi was regarded as a national hero. He led his Third Army against the Russian forces at the final Battle of Mukden, ending the land combat phase of operations of the war.

British historian Richard Storry noted that Nogi imposed the best of the Japanese &quot;samurai&quot; tradition on the men under his command such that &quot;...the conduct of the Japanese during the Russo-Japanese War towards both prisoners and Chinese civilians won the respect, and indeed admiration, of the world&quot;.

Both of Nogi&#x27;s sons, who were army lieutenants during the war, were killed in action. Though Nogi&#x27;s elder son Katsunori (August 28, 1879 – May 27, 1904) had been a sickly child, he had managed to enter the imperial military academy on his third try. He was hit in the abdomen at the Battle of Nanshan and died of blood loss while undergoing surgery at a field hospital. His second son Yasunori (December 16, 1881 – November 30, 1904), a second lieutenant at Port Arthur, fell on a rocky slope, striking his head and dying instantly. Yasunori received a posthumous promotion to lieutenant, and was buried by his father in the Aoyama cemetery.

At the end of the war, Nogi made a report directly to Emperor Meiji during a &quot;Gozen Kaigi&quot;. When explaining battles of the Siege of Port Arthur in detail, he broke down and wept, apologizing for the 56,000 lives lost in that campaign and asking to be allowed to kill himself in atonement. Emperor Meiji told him that suicide was unacceptable, as all responsibility for the war was due to imperial orders, and that Nogi must remain alive, at least as long as he himself lived.

== Postwar career ==
After the war, Nogi was elevated to the title of count and awarded the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, Grand Cordon, 1907.

As head of the Peers&#x27; School from 1908 to 1912, he was the mentor of the young Hirohito, and was, perhaps, the most important influence on the life of the future emperor of Japan.

Nogi spent most of his personal fortune on hospitals for wounded soldiers and on memorial monuments erected around the country in commemoration of those killed during the Russo-Japanese War. He also successfully petitioned the Japanese government to erect a Russian-style memorial monument in Port Arthur to the Russian dead of that campaign.

== Scouting ==
Nogi is significant to Scouting in Japan, as in 1911, he went to England in attendance on Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito for the coronation of King George V. The General, as the &quot;Defender of Port Arthur&quot; was introduced to General Robert Baden-Powell, the &quot;Defender of Mafeking&quot;, by Lord Kitchener, whose expression &quot;Once a Scout, always a Scout&quot; remains to this day.

== Suicide ==

Nogi and his wife Shizuko committed suicide by &quot;seppuku&quot; shortly after the Emperor Meiji&#x27;s funeral cortege left the palace. The ritual suicide was in accordance with the &quot;samurai&quot; practice of following one&#x27;s master to death (&quot;junshi&quot;). In his suicide letter, he said that he wished to expiate for his disgrace in Kyūshū, and for the thousands of casualties at Port Arthur. He also donated his body to medical science.All four members of the Nogi family are buried at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo. Under State Shinto, Nogi was revered as a &quot;kami&quot;. Nogi Shrine, a Shinto shrine in his honor, still exists on the site of his house in Nogizaka, Tokyo. His memory is also honored in other locations such as the Nogi Shrine in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, where the mausoleum of Emperor Meiji was established.

== Legacy ==

Nogi&#x27;s &quot;seppuku&quot; immediately created a sensation and a controversy. Some writers claimed that it reflected Nogi&#x27;s disgust with the profligacy and decline in moral values of late Meiji Japan. Others pointed to Nogi&#x27;s own suicide note, calling it an act of atonement for mistakes in his military career. In either case, Nogi&#x27;s suicide marked the end of an era, and it had a profound impact on contemporary writers, such as Mori Ōgai, Kuroiwa Ruikō and Natsume Sōseki. For the public, Nogi became a symbol of loyalty and sacrifice.

The epic historical novel &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot; portrays Nogi as floundering at the Siege of Port Arthur and having to be relieved by Kodama Gentarō. Several books have been released in recent years rehabilitating Nogi&#x27;s image and showing he was a competent leader.
The Nogi Warehouse in the Sannomaru enceinte of Nagoya Castle was named after him.

==Man of letters==
Nogi is also noted in Japan as a man of letters. His Kanshi poems (poems in the Chinese language) were especially popular among the Japanese during his time. Three of his Kanshi poems are famous.

Right after the Battle of Nanshan of 1904, in which he lost his eldest son, he wrote:
After the battle of Hill 203 of 1904–05, in which he lost his second son, he wrote:
After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, he wrote:

==Portrayals==
Maresuke was portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai in the 1980 Japanese war drama film &quot;The Battle of Port Arthur&quot; (sometimes referred as &quot;203 Kochi&quot;). Directed by Toshio Masuda the film depicted the Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War and starred Nakadai as General Maresuke, Tetsurō Tamba as General Kodama Gentarō, and Toshirō Mifune as Emperor Meiji.

In the NHK television adaptation of Ryōtarō Shiba&#x27;s epic &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot;, which aired from 2009 to 2011, Nogi was portrayed by actor Akira Emoto.

In the manga and NHK television adaptation of &quot;Monster&quot;, General Nogi is mentioned by the Turkish elder and community leader, Mr. Deniz, convincing the others to trust Dr. Kenzo Tenma and a local prostitute when they attempt to convince the leaders of Frankfurt&#x27;s Turkish Quarter to be wary of an imminent arson attack by neo-Nazis, led by The Baby. Deniz makes reference to an incident wherein General Nogi saved an Ottoman fleet of the Turkish Navy that had run aground in the Pacific. Although this is most likely a confusion with Yamada Torajirō who did assist after the sinking of Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul.

<doc id="252381" wikidata="Q857933" url="?curid=252381" title="Canada's Walk of Fame">
<text>Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame () in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is a walk of fame that acknowledges the achievements and accomplishments of Canadians who have excelled in their respective fields. It is a series of maple leaf-like stars embedded in 13 designated blocks&#x27; worth of sidewalks in Toronto in front of Roy Thomson Hall, The Princess of Wales Theatre, and The Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street as well as Simcoe Street.

The first group was inducted in 1998, and it now includes 204 Canadian activists, scientists, philanthropists, athletes, coaches, actors, directors, writers, producers, musicians, comedians, cartoonists, models and others.

== History ==
The Walk of Fame was conceived in 1996 when co-founder Peter Soumalias suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea, but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard, Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight. In spite of a lack of funds, research and no media plan, the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998. Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame has become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto, and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event.

==Induction==
===Process===

Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame has five categories:

* Arts &amp; Entertainment
* Business &amp; Entrepreneurship
* Philanthropy &amp; Humanities
* Science &amp; Technology
* Sports &amp; Athletics
Nominations for potential inductees are accepted from the public year-round, culminating with their &quot;National Nomination Promotion&quot; during the month of April. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail. Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year, which are then sent to selection committee for consideration.

The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of ten years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada&#x27;s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee&#x27;s evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.

===Ceremony===
New inductees are inducted annually at an unveiling ceremony where their star, a stylized maple leaf, is revealed. The first was held in 1998 and only four of the twelve living inductees attended: Karen Kain, Norman Jewison, Barbara Ann Scott and Rich Little. The 2007 ceremony was held at Toronto&#x27;s Hummingbird Centre, was attended by all seven inductees and was hosted by Eugene Levy.

Past hosts include Trish Stratus, Tom Green, Jann Arden, Kurt Browning and Catriona Le May Doan. The ceremony was broadcast by CTV until 2008. Beginning in 2009 the ceremony was broadcast by Global. The first ceremony on the network was hosted by Anne Murray while Howie Mandel hosted for the following two years. Paul Shaffer hosted the event in 2012.

==Awards==

===Cineplex Legends Award===
Established in 2008, the Cineplex Legends Award is posthumously awarded to &quot;Canadian pioneers in film, music, sport, arts, and innovation.&quot; Sponsored by Cineplex Entertainment, the first recipients of the award were siblings Norma and Douglas Shearer. The award recipients are also given stars on the Walk of Fame.

=== Allan Slaight Honour ===
First awarded in 2010, the Allan Slaight Honour, named after the leading figure in the Canadian radio industry, is awarded to a young Canadian for &quot;making a positive impact in the fields of music.&quot; Recipients receive an honorarium of $10,000 from the Slaight Foundation, but are not considered inductees of the Walk of Fame. So far, recipients of the Slaight award have been Nikki Yanofsky, Drake, Melanie Fiona, Carly Rae Jepsen, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Brett Kissel, Shawn Hook, Jessie Reyez and Alessia Cara.

=== RBC Emerging Artist Music Mentorship Prize ===
In 2012, in partnership with RBC, Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame created the RBC Emerging Artist Music Mentorship Prize. Valued at more than $100,000, it aims to support young Canadian musicians who submit a one-minute musical audio or audiovisual performance for a chance to win $25,000 cash, recording time, performance opportunities and more.

== Festival ==
Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame Festival was established in 2010. It spans three days, culminating with the Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame Awards Show. It has included performances from Canadian musicians such as Sarah McLachlan, Serena Ryder, Crystal Shawanda, Tom Cochrane and Melanie Fiona. It has also screened Canadian films and comedy acts.

== Criticism ==

In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC criticized the Walk of Fame, calling it &quot;just an attraction to lure tourists to theatres in the area.&quot; She claimed that it would only honour Canadians with international impact, saying &quot;if it was truly for Canadians, then I think there would be more of a national bend to the whole thing. But I doubt I&#x27;m going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada.&quot;

In September 2010, William Shatner commented on Twitter regarding damage to his star on the Walk of Fame: &quot;I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but, then again, so am I. I wonder if anybody hovering around that area can tell me what&#x27;s wrong with it and what needs fixing.&quot; The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to his star. The Canadian Press reported that &quot;A number of celebrities&#x27; stars are looking a bit rough around the edges.&quot; The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage was due to the freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe&#x27;s damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.

<text>Harve Bennett (born Harvard Bennett Fischman; August 17, 1930 – February 25, 2015) was an American television and film producer and screenwriter.

==Early years==
Bennett was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, in 1930, the son of Kathryn (née Susman), a journalist, and Yale Fishman, a lawyer. As a young boy, Bennett appeared on the radio program &quot;Quiz Kids&quot;, which introduced him to show business. By the time Bennett had reached college age, the radio business was in decline, and he turned to the world of film. He entered the University of California, Los Angeles and graduated from their film school. Following his graduation from college, in 1953 Bennett joined the United States Army. He served in the Military Police Corps, based at the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Lompoc, California. He was honorably discharged in 1955 with the rank of corporal. Bennett then began his career as a production executive. He first worked at CBS in New York City and later moved to the programming department of ABC, becoming Vice President of Daytime Programming. At ABC, he rose to become Vice President of Programming for a time.

==Move to production==
Following his work with ABC, Bennett moved over to production. His first project was to develop a television series with producer Aaron Spelling called &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, which Bennett produced from 1968 until 1973.

Following &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, Bennett joined Universal Studios where he produced a variety of television series and miniseries. The best known of these series are probably &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1973–78) and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976-78). Other series and miniseries he produced at Universal include &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1975) and &quot;Gemini Man&quot; (1976).

Bennett then moved to Columbia Pictures Television where he continued as a television producer, along with MGM TV employee Harris Katleman, which was joint partner from 1977 to 1980. His projects at Columbia Pictures included the series &quot;Salvage 1&quot; (1979) and the miniseries &quot;The Jesse Owens Story&quot; (1984).

While working at Columbia Pictures TV, Bennett was also brought to Paramount Pictures to work in their television division producing television series. One of his first productions for Paramount was a television miniseries for Paramount Domestic Television, &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982), which was Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s final role and which co-starred Leonard Nimoy.

==&quot;Star Trek&quot;==
In 1980, only a few weeks into his contract with Paramount, Bennett was called to a meeting with then top executives of Paramount Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, along with Charles Bluhdorn who was then head of Paramount&#x27;s parent Gulf+Western. Bluhdorn, dissatisfied with the results of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, was looking for someone new to take over the next film in the series.

According to Bennett, Bluhdorn asked him what he thought of the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film and, after Bennett said he found it boring, Bluhdorn asked him if he could make a better picture and if he could do it for less than $45 million (the eventual budget of the first film). When Bennett said that he could, Bluhdorn said &quot;do it&quot; and he was hired.

To prepare for the job of producing a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, Bennett first screened all 79 episodes of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in a projection room at Paramount. He was particularly drawn to the episode &quot;Space Seed,&quot; which featured Ricardo Montalbán as the genetically enhanced supervillain Khan Noonien Singh. At the conclusion of the episode, Khan and his followers are exiled to an uninhabited planet, and James T. Kirk and Spock wonder what will become of them. This gave Bennett the &#x27;hook&#x27; he was looking for, and led him to develop a sequel to the episode.

Bennett&#x27;s idea formed the beginnings of what would become &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Bennett himself developed the original story premise, and then worked with screenwriter Jack B. Sowards on the early drafts of the screenplay. Nicholas Meyer was later introduced to Bennett and completed the final drafts of the script, in addition to directing the film with Bennett as executive producer and Robert Sallin as producer. &quot;Star Trek II&quot; proved to be an enormous success, both in terms of the box office receipts and fan response.

Following the success of &quot;Star Trek II&quot;, Bennett served as producer on the next three &quot;Star Trek&quot; films: &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;—which for a long time stood as one of the most successful of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films—and &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;. In addition to serving as producer, Bennett also wrote &quot;Star Trek III&quot;, co-wrote the story and screenplay for &quot;Star Trek IV&quot;, and co-wrote the story for &quot;Star Trek V&quot;. Bennett also made cameo appearances in &quot;Star Trek III&quot; (as the voice of the flight recorder) and &quot;Star Trek V&quot; (as a Starfleet Chief of Staff Admiral who gives Captain Kirk his orders).

Following &quot;Star Trek V&quot;, Bennett developed an idea for a sixth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film that would take a different approach from the previous films. Titled &quot;The Academy Years&quot;, it would have focused on the characters of Kirk and Spock when they were much younger and cadets at Starfleet Academy. It would have delved into the early relationships between these characters, and shown how they developed such a close friendship over the years. While William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy would have had cameos at the beginning and end of the film to &quot;bookend&quot; the story in flashback form, new actors would have portrayed most of the roles in the film, including the young Kirk and Spock.

Although Paramount was initially enthusiastic about the idea, feedback from fans was almost universally negative over a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film without the established actors that fans had come to know and love. Also, Martin Davis who at the time was the head of Gulf &amp; Western, wanted a film featuring the original cast to mark &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s 25th anniversary in 1991. Paramount offered Bennett the opportunity to produce this film with the original cast, even offering to produce his academy film afterward, but Bennett declined, citing multiple reasons including a lack of story ideas for the requested film and the rushed time frame in which the film would have to be completed in order to coincide with &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s 25th anniversary.

This marked the end of Bennett&#x27;s association with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, and shortly thereafter he left Paramount. The sixth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film was later titled &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; and was released in movie theaters on December 6, 1991.

==Later works==
After producing the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, Bennett wrote the television movie &quot;Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232&quot; (1992). He co-created and produced the science-fiction television series &quot;Time Trax&quot; (1993–1995), and produced the animated miniseries &quot;Invasion America&quot; (1998), for which Nimoy was a voice actor.

==Death==
Bennett died on February 25, 2015, in Medford, Oregon, due to a burst embolism in his small intestine and a second one found in his lung. His death occurred two days before that of Leonard Nimoy. He was interred at the Willamette National Cemetery.

<doc id="252385" wikidata="Q15718082" url="?curid=252385" title="List of governors of Utah">
<text>The governor of Utah is the head of government of Utah and the commander-in-chief of its military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws as well as the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Utah Legislature. The governor may also convene the legislature on &quot;extraordinary occasions&quot;.

The self-proclaimed State of Deseret, precursor to the organization of the Utah Territory, had only one governor, Brigham Young. Utah Territory had 15 territorial governors from its organization in 1850 until the formation of the state of Utah in 1896, appointed by the President of the United States. John W. Dawson had the shortest term of only three weeks and Brigham Young, the first territorial governor, had the longest term at seven years.

There have been 18 governors of the State of Utah, with the longest serving being Cal Rampton, who served three terms from 1965 to 1977. Olene Walker served the shortest term, the remaining 14 months of Mike Leavitt&#x27;s term upon Leavitt&#x27;s resignation to become head of the Environmental Protection Agency. At the age of 36, Heber Manning Wells was the youngest person to become governor. At the age of 70, Simon Bamberger became the oldest person to be elected, while Olene Walker, at age 72, was the oldest person to succeed to the office. 

J. Bracken Lee was the most recent of three Governors of Utah who was not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the other two being Simon Bamberger (1917–1921) and George Dern (1925–1933).

Currently, a term of service is set at four years, and there are no overall limits (consecutive or lifetime) to the number of terms one may be elected to serve. Elections for the office of Governor of Utah are normally held in November of the same year as the United States presidential election.

The current governor is Spencer Cox, who took office on January 4, 2021. Governor Cox was elected in November 2020.

==Qualifications==
Anyone who seeks to be elected Governor of Utah must meet the following qualifications:
*Be at least 30 years old
*Be a resident of Utah for at least five years on the day of the election
*Be a United States citizen
*Be a qualified elector of Utah at the time of election
==List of governors==
The area that became Utah was part of the Mexican Cession obtained by the United States on May 19, 1848, in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican–American War.

===State of Deseret===
A constitutional convention was convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, to work on a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.

===Territory of Utah===
On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, Utah Territory was organized, encompassing roughly the northern half of Deseret. The news did not reach Salt Lake City until January 1851. Governors of the Utah Territory were appointed by the president of the United States, and other than Brigham Young, they were frequently considered carpetbagger patronage appointees.

===State of Utah===
The State of Utah was admitted to the Union on January 4, 1896.

The governor has a four-year term, commencing on the first Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be vacant, the power be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant during the first year of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant after the first year of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah is one of the few states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.

<doc id="252386" wikidata="Q1915357" url="?curid=252386" title="Hélène Smith">
<text>Hélène Smith (real name Catherine-Elise Müller, December 9, 1861, Martigny – June 10, 1929, Geneva) was a famous late-19th century French medium. She was known as &quot;the Muse of Automatic Writing&quot; by the Surrealists, who viewed Smith as evidence of the power of the surreal, and a symbol of surrealist knowledge. Late in life, Smith claimed to communicate with Martians, and to be a reincarnation of a Hindu princess and Marie Antoinette.

==Early life==

Daughter of a Hungarian merchant, Smith worked as an employee in a commercial house. She discovered spiritualism in 1891 and joined a spiritualist &quot;development&quot; circle. According to her fellow believers, she began to show evidence of mediumistic abilities in 1892, and claimed to communicate with Victor Hugo and Cagliostro.

==Career as medium==
She became well known in Geneva, and it was there that Flournoy made her acquaintance. Her channeling evolved from the usual raps and table-tipping to somnambulatory trances, of which she remembered nothing. While in this state she experienced clear images of faraway places such as a civilization on Mars, and of her own former lives. She would write out the Martian communications on paper and translate them into French, popularizing automatic writing.
In 1900, Élise Müller became famous with the publication of &quot;Des Indes à la Planete Mars&quot; (&quot;From India to the Planet Mars&quot;) by Théodore Flournoy, Professor of Psychology at the University of Geneva. The medium and the psychologist remained very close until 1899, when &quot;Des Indes à la planète Mars&quot; was first published. The book documented her various series of experiences in terms of romantic cycles: the &quot;Martian&quot; cycle, &quot;Ultramartian&quot; cycle, &quot;Hindu&quot;, &quot;Oriental&quot;, and &quot;royal&quot; cycles.

In 1900, a certain Mrs. Jackson, a rich American spiritualist who was impressed by Müller, offered her a salary which would permit her to quit her job and dedicate herself to pursuing and documenting her experiences. Müller accepted and was able to continue with further cycles. She also began to paint her visions and particular religious images of Christ.

Smith is mentioned by André Breton in his book &quot;Nadja&quot; where he compares her to the eponymous character. 

&quot;A brief scene in dialogue at the end of my &quot;Poisson Soluble,&quot; and which seems to be all she has yet read of the &quot;Manifest&quot;, a scene whose precise meaning moreover...gives her the impression of having actually participated in it and even of having played the-if anything obscure- part of Hélène.&quot;

==Evaluation==
Théodore Flournoy considered her &quot;cycles&quot; as the products of what he judged to be infantile imaginings and her Martian language as a mere constructed language. Flournoy concluded that her &quot;Martian&quot; language had a strong resemblance to Ms. Smith&#x27;s native language of French and that her automatic writing was &quot;romances of the subliminal imagination, derived largely from forgotten sources (for example, books read as a child).&quot; He invented the term cryptomnesia to describe this phenomenon.

Psychologists Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones have written:

The case was examined in depth by psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe in 1952 who noted that Smith had suffered from a fantasy prone personality and hysterical hallucinations.

<doc id="252387" wikidata="Q205319" url="?curid=252387" title="Gilles Duceppe">
<text>Gilles Duceppe (; born July 22, 1947) is a Canadian retired politician, proponent of the Quebec sovereignty movement and former leader of the Bloc Québécois. He was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada for over 20 years and was the leader of the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois for 15 years in three stints: 1996, 1997–2011 and in 2015. He was Leader of the Official Opposition in the Parliament of Canada from March 17, 1997, to June 1, 1997. He resigned as party leader after the 2011 election, in which he lost his own seat to New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Hélène Laverdière and his party suffered a heavy defeat; however, he returned four years later to lead the party into the 2015 election. After being defeated in his own riding by Laverdière again, he resigned once more.

==Early life and education==
Duceppe was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Hélène (née Rowley) and actor Jean Duceppe. His maternal grandfather was John James Rowley, British by birth, Irish by descent, and a home child. Duceppe once joked about his British roots, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a bloke who turned Bloc.&quot;

Duceppe has told the story of an anglophone Grade 6 teacher slapping him after he complained about preferential treatment being given to anglophone students. Duceppe claimed he slapped the teacher back. He became a sovereigntist by the age of 20, inspired by René Lévesque and the founding of the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association.

Duceppe completed his high school studies at the Collège Mont-Saint-Louis. He then studied political science at the Université de Montréal but did not complete his program of study. While attending the Université de Montréal, he became general manager of the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Quartier Latin&quot;. In his youth, he advocated communism, and held membership in the Workers&#x27; Communist Party of Canada (WCP), a Maoist group. Duceppe later claimed that his three-year membership in the WCP was a mistake brought on by a search for absolute answers.

However, during this period (which lasted well into his thirties) he subscribed to militant Maoist ideology and was fired from his job as a hospital orderly for belligerent activities. Duceppe even went so far as to intentionally spoil his 1980 sovereignty-association referendum ballot arguing that Québécois should instead focus their efforts on staying united to fight capitalism.

===Early career===
Before becoming a member of Parliament, Duceppe worked as a hospital orderly and later became a trade union negotiator. In 1968 he became vice-president of the Union générale des étudiants du Québec (General Union of Quebec Students) and in 1970 manager of the Université de Montréal student paper, &quot;Quartier latin&quot;. In 1972 he launched his career in community and union settings, as moderator for the citizen&#x27;s committee of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, then in 1977 as a representative for the Royal Victoria Hospital employees. In 1981 he became a union organizer for the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (Confederation of National Trade Unions), where he became a negotiator in 1986.

==Parliament==
===Election===
In 1990, Duceppe was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election for the eastern Montreal riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie. He defeated Liberal Denis Coderre, who would later serve alongside Duceppe in Parliament before becoming Mayor of Montreal. Duceppe would be handily re-elected at each election from 1993 to 2008.

===Tenure===
Duceppe originally sat as an independent because the Bloc had not been registered by Elections Canada as a political party. All of the Bloc&#x27;s other Members of Parliament had crossed the floor from either the Progressive Conservative Party or the Liberal Party earlier that year. Duceppe&#x27;s victory demonstrated — for the first time — that the party had electoral support in Quebec and could win elections. Previously, many pundits (and members of other parties) predicted that the Bloc would not gain traction with ordinary voters in Quebec.

==Leadership of the Bloc Québécois==
In 1996, when Lucien Bouchard stepped down as Bloc leader to become leader of the Parti Québécois, Duceppe served as interim leader of the party. Michel Gauthier eventually became the official leader later that year. However, Gauthier&#x27;s lack of visibility in both Quebec and English Canada coupled with his weak leadership resulted in the party forcing him out in 1997. Duceppe won the ensuing leadership contest and became the official leader of the Bloc Québécois and Leader of the Opposition.

In the 1997 general election, the Bloc lost official opposition status, slipping to third place in the House of Commons behind Preston Manning&#x27;s Reform Party. During the campaign, Duceppe visited a cheese factory where he was photographed wearing a hairnet resembling a shower cap, which was widely parodied on Canadian television.

The Bloc lost more support during the 2000 election, winning just 38 seats. Over this period, critics derided Duceppe as an ineffectual campaigner, though no serious challenge to his leadership emerged.

When Jean Chrétien stepped down as Prime Minister, to be succeeded by Paul Martin, the Bloc&#x27;s fortunes improved markedly, particularly after the sponsorship scandal erupted. Duceppe strongly criticized the Liberals over the misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec. During the election&#x27;s national debates, Duceppe&#x27;s lucid explanations of Bloc Québécois policies and his chastising of the other national party leaders&#x27; promises, resulted in both the French and English media ruling him the best speaker. In the 2004 election, Duceppe&#x27;s Bloc won 54 seats in the Commons, equalling what it had won in its 1993 breakthrough, while Martin&#x27;s Liberals were reduced to a minority government.

With Chrétien&#x27;s departure, Duceppe became the longest-serving leader of a major party in Canada. With the recent success of the Bloc, and his recently well-received performance as leader, speculation mounted that Duceppe might seek the leadership of the Parti Québécois – particularly when Bernard Landry stepped down as party leader on June 4, 2005. On June 13, 2005, Duceppe announced that he would not run for the leadership of the PQ.

Duceppe&#x27;s Bloc, along with the Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives and Jack Layton&#x27;s NDP, worked together on November 28, 2005 to pass a motion of no confidence in the minority Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin after findings in the Sponsorship Scandal. In the resultant 2006 federal election, many Bloc insiders believed that Duceppe&#x27;s popularity, combined with the unpopularity of the federal Liberal Party in Quebec, would push the Bloc Québécois over the symbolic majority vote mark among Quebec voters. Many Quebec separatists felt that a strong performance by the Bloc in the 2006 federal election would boost the sovereignty movement and perhaps set the stage for a new referendum on secession after the anticipated Quebec provincial election expected in 2007. In actuality, a late surge in Conservative and federalist support kept the Bloc&#x27;s share of the popular vote below 43% giving the Bloc only 51 seats. The Conservatives&#x27; gains in Quebec, as well as Ontario, gave the party enough seats to form a minority government with Harper as prime minister, replacing the Liberals&#x27; Paul Martin. The unimpressive and lackluster results on election night called into question the level of separatist support in Quebec.

In the March 26, 2007 Quebec provincial election, the Parti Québécois found itself reduced to third place in the National Assembly of Quebec, behind both the governing Quebec Liberal Party and the opposition Action démocratique du Québec. Following this disappointing result, the PQ leader, André Boisclair, announced his resignation on May 8, 2007. Duceppe confirmed on May 11, 2007, that he would seek the PQ leadership but the next day he withdrew from the race. After his withdrawal, Duceppe announced that he would support two-time leadership hopeful Pauline Marois.

===2008 federal election===
In the 2008 federal election, Duceppe led the Bloc Québécois to 49 seats, up one from its pre-dissolution standing of 48. However, the Bloc&#x27;s share of the popular vote fell again, to 38%, its lowest result since 1997. After the election, Liberals and NDP reached a deal form a minority coalition government with support from the Bloc Québécois, which would have toppled the minority Conservative government, however the Governor General agreed to prorogue parliament before the vote could take place. After prorogation, the Liberals underwent a change in leadership and distanced themselves from the coalition agreement and supported the Conservatives&#x27; budget. However Duceppe&#x27;s Bloc and Jack Layton&#x27;s NDP remained committed to voting against the Conservatives.

===2011 federal election and resignation===
In 2011, the Bloc cooperated with the Liberals and NDP to find the Conservative government in contempt of Parliament, after all three opposition parties indicated that they would not accept the Conservatives&#x27; budget, leading Prime Minister Harper to request the dissolution of parliament. The Bloc demanded $5 billion for the province, including compensation for damages from the January 1998 North American ice storm and $175 million towards a new hockey arena to bring back the Quebec Nordiques, which the Conservatives dismissed outright.

In the resultant 2011 federal election, the Bloc lost 43 of their 47 seats—including many seats they&#x27;d held since their 1993 breakthrough—cutting them down to a rump of four MPs and losing official party status. Much of that support bled to the NDP, who ascended from fourth place to second place to become the Official Opposition, largely by winning 59 seats in Quebec which included a sweep of the Bloc&#x27;s heartlands in Quebec City and eastern Montreal. The NDP, which entered the election with Outremont MP Tom Mulcair as their only elected representative in the province, had surged in the last weeks of the campaign at the expense of the Bloc due to NDP leader Jack Layton&#x27;s charismatic personality and leftist nationalism policies, while Bloc &quot;over the years defend[ed] Quebec&#x27;s interests, but the sovereigntist agenda is no longer very relevant&quot;. Duceppe lost his own seat to NDP challenger Hélène Laverdière by 5,400 votes.

Accepting responsibility for the Bloc&#x27;s crushing defeat, Duceppe announced his pending resignation as Bloc leader soon after the result was beyond doubt. He remained defiant, however, vowing not to rest &quot;until Quebec becomes a country&quot;.

===Spending allegations===
In January 2012, Duceppe was accused of having used funds designated for his parliamentary office to pay the Bloc Québécois&#x27; general manager over a seven-year period. Duceppe denied any wrongdoing when testifying before the House of Commons Board of Internal Economy in February. In November 2012, the partisan House of Commons Board of Internal Economy found that Duceppe misused funds. However, the board cannot take disciplinary action as the money was spent before the by-laws around the issue were changed.

==Retirement and brief return to politics==
Duceppe has worked as a political analyst since his departure from parliament. In 2014, he denounced comments made by newly elected Bloc leader Mario Beaulieu in which he seemingly dismissed the Bloc under Duceppe as having followed a gradualist strategy for achieving sovereignty which Beaulieu characterised as defeatist and for invoking the phrase &quot;nous vaincrons&quot; (we will vanquish), which was a slogan employed by the paramilitary Front de libération du Québec.

After two years of further decline in the polls and internal divisions, it was announced June 10, 2015 that Duceppe would be returning to lead the Bloc into the campaign while his successor, Mario Beaulieu would relinquish the leadership but remain party president. The party executive agreed on June 9, 2015, to split the positions of president and party leader in order to facilitate Duceppe&#x27;s return. The changes were ratified by the party&#x27;s general council on July 1.

On August 1, 2015, it was reported that Duceppe had decided to contest his former riding of Laurier-Sainte-Marie in the upcoming federal election and that he would announce this in a press conference shortly after the election was called, which occurred on August 2. However, while leading his party to a win of 10 seats in the October 19, 2015 election, up from two, Duceppe was personally defeated in his riding and announced his resignation as leader several days later.

Duceppe&#x27;s son Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe was elected to parliament in the 2019 federal election. In 2024, he commented on Trudeau saying Liberals &quot;don&#x27;t have another choice&quot; for leader before the 45th Canadian federal election.

<doc id="252391" wikidata="Q29529370" url="?curid=252391" title="List of governors of Georgia">
<text>The governor of Georgia is the head of government of the U.S. state of Georgia and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. Republican Brian Kemp assumed office on January 14, 2019.
There have officially been 83 governors of the State of Georgia, including 11 who served more than one distinct term (John Houstoun, George Walton, Edward Telfair, George Mathews, Jared Irwin, David Brydie Mitchell, George Rockingham Gilmer, M. Hoke Smith, Joseph Mackey Brown, John M. Slaton and Eugene Talmadge, with Herman Talmadge serving two &quot;de facto&quot; distinct terms).

The longest-serving governors are George Busbee, Joe Frank Harris, Zell Miller, Sonny Perdue and Nathan Deal, each of whom served two full four-year terms; Joseph E. Brown, governor during the Civil War, was elected four times, serving seven and a half years. The shortest term of the post-revolutionary period is that of Matthew Talbot, who served 13 days after succeeding his predecessor, who died in office. Eugene Talmadge died in December 1946 before taking office in his second distinct term, leading to a dispute in which three people claimed the office.

==Governors==
Georgia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on January 2, 1788. Before it declared its independence, Georgia was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. It seceded from the Union on January 19, 1861, and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, Georgia during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Georgia was readmitted to the Union on July 25, 1868; again expelled from Congress on March 3, 1869; and again readmitted on July 15, 1870.

The Rules and Regulations of the Colony, drafted in 1776, provided for a president to serve a term of 6 months. A formal constitution was drafted in 1777, providing for a governor to serve a term of one year, but no more than one year out of every three. The term was lengthened to two years in 1789, but with no term limit. The 1865 constitution required governors to take four years off after serving two terms, but that was quickly changed in the 1868 constitution, which allowed four-year terms with no limits. The term length was returned to the two-year term and limit of the 1865 constitution in 1877.

The 1945 constitution changed the length of terms to four years, with governors required to take four years off before running again, and it created the office of Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, who would exercise the powers of the governor should the office become vacant. This was changed in 1983 so that the lieutenant governor fully becomes governor in that circumstance. Before the creation of the office of lieutenant governor, the president of the senate (or, before 1789, the president of the executive council) would exercise the powers of governor. The 1983 constitution also allows governors to succeed themselves once, before having to wait four years to run again. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

<text>The governor of Nebraska is the head of government of the U.S. state of Nebraska as provided by the fourth article of the Constitution of Nebraska. The officeholder is elected to a four-year term, with elections held two years after presidential elections. The governor may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. The current officeholder is Jim Pillen, a Republican, who was sworn in on January 5, 2023.

Governors of Nebraska must be at least 30 years old and have been citizens and residents of the state for five years before being elected. Before 1966, the governor was elected to a two-year term. In 1962, a constitutional amendment extended the gubernatorial term to four years, effective with the 1966 election. In 1966, another amendment imposed a term limit of two consecutive terms. The lieutenant governor is subject to the same limitations and runs on a combined ticket with the governor. Charles W. Bryan is the only Governor of Nebraska to serve non-consecutive terms. Dave Heineman holds the record as Nebraska&#x27;s longest-serving governor with 10 years.

The governor&#x27;s term, along with all other elected statewide officers, begins on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in the month of January after an election. If the governor becomes incapacitated or is out of the state, the lieutenant governor acts as governor; if there is a vacancy or permanent incapacitation, the lieutenant governor becomes governor and serves the balance of the term. However, if both offices become vacant, the next person in the line of succession is the Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, who is then followed by the chairs of various committees in the legislature.

==List of governors==
===Nebraska Territory===
Nebraska Territory was organized on May 30, 1854. It had five governors appointed by the president of the United States.

On July 26, 1853, William Walker was elected provisional governor of Nebraska Territory; this spurred the federal government into action to organize the territory.

===State of Nebraska===

Nebraska was admitted to the Union on March 1, 1867.

<doc id="252400" wikidata="Q878647" url="?curid=252400" title="List of governors of North Carolina">
<text>The governor of North Carolina is the head of government of the U.S. state of North Carolina and commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces.

There have been 70 governors of North Carolina, with six serving non-consecutive terms, totaling 76 terms. The current governor is Democrat Josh Stein, who took office on January 1, 2025.

== Governors ==

=== Presidents of the Council ===
Prior to declaring its independence, North Carolina was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The 13-member Provincial Council, renamed the Council of Safety in April 1776, was essentially the executive authority during the second year of the revolution, and was appointed by the Provincial Congress. The Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Congress could each be considered the highest offices in the state during this time, but the council was supreme when the congress was not in session.

Cornelius Harnett served as the first president from October 18, 1775, to August 21, 1776. Samuel Ashe then served until September 27, 1776, and Willie Jones until October 25, 1776, at which time a state government had been formed.

===State governors===

North Carolina was one of the original Thirteen Colonies, and was admitted as a state on November 21, 1789. It seceded from the Union on May 20, 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, North Carolina during Reconstruction was part of the Second Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. North Carolina was readmitted to the Union on July 4, 1868.

The first constitution of 1776 created the office of governor, to be chosen by the legislature annually, and whom may only serve up to three out of every six years. An amendment in 1835 changed this to popular election for a term of two years, allowing them to succeed themselves once. The 1868 constitution lengthened terms to four years, to commence on the first day of January after the election, but they could not succeed themselves, a limit that was changed in 1977 to allow them to succeed themselves once.

The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1868, to act as governor when that office is vacant; in 1971 this was changed so that the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Before the office was created, the speaker of the senate would act as governor should it be vacant. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

<text>The governor of Vermont is the head of government of the U.S. state of Vermont. Since 1994, Vermont is one of only two U.S. states (New Hampshire being the other) that elects governors for two-year terms. Until 1870, Vermont elected its governors for one-year terms. Isaac Tichenor, Jonas Galusha, Erastus Fairbanks, and Richard A. Snelling each served non-consecutive terms, while Thomas Chittenden served non-consecutive terms as Governor of the Vermont Republic.

==Mountain Rule==
From the founding of the Republican Party in the 1850s until the 1960s, only Republicans won general elections for Vermont&#x27;s statewide offices. One method that made this possible was the Republican Party&#x27;s imposition of the &quot;Mountain Rule,&quot; an informal mechanism which restricted the pool of candidates.

Under the original provisions of the Mountain Rule, one U.S. senator was a resident of the east side of the Green Mountains and one resided on the west side. The expanded version of the rule called for the governorship and lieutenant governorship to alternate between residents of the east and west side. Nominees for governor and lieutenant governor were originally allowed two one-year terms, and later one two-year term. For nearly 100 years, likely Republican candidates for office in Vermont agreed to abide by the expanded Mountain Rule in the interests of party unity. Several factors led to the eventual weakening of the Mountain Rule, including the long political dispute between the Proctor (conservative) and Aiken–Gibson (progressive) wings of the party; primaries rather than conventions to select nominees; the direct election of U.S. Senators; and several active third parties, including the Progressives, the Prohibition Party, and the Local Option movement. In the 1960s, the rise of the Vermont Democratic Party and the construction of Interstate 89 also contributed to the end of the Mountain Rule. Although I-89 is a north–south route, it traverses Vermont from southeast to northwest for the majority of its length within the state and changed the way residents view how it is divided.

<text>The governor of Nevada is the head of government of the U.S. state of Nevada. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the Nevada state government. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Nevada Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, as well as, except in cases of treason or impeachment, to grant pardons and reprieves.

The governor serves a four-year term. An amendment in 1970 limits them to two terms, even if they are non-consecutive. The lieutenant governor of Nevada is officially not elected on the same ticket as the governor. Should there be a vacancy in the office of governor, the powers devolve onto the lieutenant governor.

The current governor is Republican Joe Lombardo, who took office on January 2, 2023.

==List of governors==
===Territory of Nevada===
Nevada Territory was formed on March 2, 1861, from Utah Territory. It had only one governor appointed by the president of the United States before it became a state. 

Before it was organized as a territory, a local convention in Genoa elected Isaac Roop provisional governor, taking office on December 15, 1859.

===State of Nevada===
Nevada was admitted to the Union on October 31, 1864. There have been thirty one governors since. The longest-serving governor was Bob Miller, who served two and a half terms from 1989 to 1999; the shortest-serving governor was Frank Bell, who acted as governor for the remaining four months of Charles C. Stevenson&#x27;s term upon the governor&#x27;s death. The current governor is Joe Lombardo, who took office on January 2, 2023.

<doc id="252408" wikidata="Q13755" url="?curid=252408" title="Bulacan">
<text>Bulacan, officially the Province of Bulacan (; ; ; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is the city of Malolos. Bulacan was established on August 15, 1578, and part of the Metro Luzon Urban Beltway Super Region. This province is a part of the Greater Manila Area.

It has 572 barangays in 20 municipalities and four component cities (Baliwag, Malolos the provincial capital, Meycauayan, and San Jose del Monte the largest city). Bulacan is located immediately north of Metro Manila. Bordering Bulacan are the provinces of Pampanga to the west, Nueva Ecija to the north, Aurora and Quezon to the east, and Metro Manila and Rizal to the south. Bulacan also lies on the north-eastern shore of Manila Bay.

In the 2020 census, Bulacan had a population of 3,708,890 people, the most populous in Central Luzon and the third most populous in the Philippines, after Cebu and Cavite. Bulacan&#x27;s most populated city is San Jose del Monte, the most populated municipality is Santa Maria, while the least populated is Doña Remedios Trinidad yet the largest municipality in terms of area.

In 1899, the historic Barasoain Church in Malolos was the birthplace of the First Philippine Republic, sometimes described as the first constitutional democracy in Asia.

On November 7, 2018, the Provincial Government of Bulacan bagged its fourth Seal of Good Local Governance award. The SGLG award is a progressive assessment system that gives distinction to remarkable governance performance.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bulacan&quot; was named after the town &quot;Bulakan&quot; which is derived from the Tagalog word &quot;bulak&quot;, which means &quot;cotton&quot; in the English language. It is due to the abundance of cotton plant growing in the region.

==History==

The First Constitutional Democracy in Asia was proclaimed in 1899 at the Barasoain Church in Malolos City, the capital of Bulacan. 

Bulacan is also the birthplace of the famous men and women of the country, like Marcelo H. del Pilar, known as &quot;The Great Propagandist&quot;, and General Gregorio del Pilar who is famed as &quot;The Tirad Pass Hero&quot;.

The poet Francisco Balagtas, the singer Nicanor Abelardo, and the sculptor Guillermo Tolentino are some notable artists from Bulacan.

The conquest of the area comprising present-day Bulacan traces to the first years of the Spanish in the Philippines. Upon the defeat of the Macabebe and Hagonoy forces led by Bambalito in the Battle of Bangkusay on June 3, 1571, Martín de Goiti to proceeded north, first to Lubao in September 1571.

Two months later, on November 14, 1571, Goiti reached Malolos and Calumpit, respectively, and it was reported to Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governor-General of the Philippines. Adelantado established Calumpit and Malolos as an encomienda entrusted to Sargento Juan Moron (Morones in other documents) and Don Marcos de Herrera. These two conquistadores were one of the first group of conquerors accompanied by Legaspi who have arrived in the Islands in 1565.

On April 5, 1572, the encomiendas of Calumpit and Malolos were unified and co-administered by Moron and Herrera. Also in that year, Alcaldia de Calumpit was formed in which the areas of Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit in Pampanga, and the settlements of Meyto, Panducot, Meysulao, and Malolos. On December 28, 1575, Governor-General Francisco Sande ordered to include Hagonoy in Calumpit.

In 1575, Bulakan was established as a visita of Tondo, and it is not part of Calumpit as the boundary between Tondo and Calumpit was marked in Mambog River and placed the statue of Our Lady of Visitacion (patroness of Calumpit) was erected. It was gone and recreated in 1997 upon the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Parish of Our Lady of Presentacion in Malolos.

On April 30, 1578, the town of Bulakan was officially established by the Augustinians, with Fray Diego Vivar as its first prior, and the convent was dedicated to San Agustin; when this was changed to Our Lady of Assumption is uncertain. It was reported that the western part of present-day Bulacan was to be very well-populated and rich. There is no documentation of the exact year and date when the Alcaldia de Calumpit was dissolved nor of the exact foundation year of the province of Bulacan. It has only been documented that Malolos (then part of Calumpit in 1572) was first to appear as part of Alcaldia de Bulacan in 1582. It may be assumed that the reorganization of encomiendas occurred between 1580 and 1582 at the time of Governor-General Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa.

The same document, also from the 1582 &quot;Relacion de las Islas Filipinas&quot; by Miguel de Loarca, reports that Alcaldia de Calumpit had jurisdiction in the areas of Calumpit (the capital), Capalangan, Cabangbangan and Hagonoy, which made up the Alcaldia&#x27;s villages. Then Loarca mentioned that Alcaldia de Bulacan had Bulakan (its capital), Malolos, Caluya, Guguinto, Binto and Catanghalan (instead of Meycauayan) as its &quot;encomiendas&quot;, which formerly had one &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor), though Loarca wrote that Alcaldia de Bulacan was formed in 1580 at the time of Peñalosa.

According to the document of Governor-General Luis Pérez Dasmariñas in the &quot;Account of the Encomiendas&quot; for the King of Spain furnished on June 21, 1591, the Alcaldia of Bulacan was part of La Pampanga with the Encomiendas subject to it such as the Encomiendas of Malolos (3,600 persons), Binto (2,000 persons), Guiguinto (2,000 persons), Caluya (2,800 persons), Mecabayan (2,800 persons) and Bulacan identified as &quot; capital&quot; and residence of &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; with 4,800 persons. In the same 1591 document, it was mentioned that &quot;Calumpit y Hagonoy&quot; belonged to Juan Moron with 12,800 persons, 2 Augustinian Convents, and 1 Alcalde Mayor of its own.

However, the establishment and development of the southern part of present-day Bulacan were not simultaneous and identified with the West. In 1578, the Order of Friars Minor, headed by Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa, arrived in the area called Toril (now part of Meycauayan) and their headquarters. Also in 1578, Plasencia established the Town of Meycauayan. Its pueblos were first only settlements of the Old Meycauayan, founded by Franciscan

The province of Bulacan is on the island of Luzon and is one of the most important &quot;Alcadias de Termino&quot;. Civilly and politically it corresponds to the &quot;Audiencia y capitanía general de Filipinas&quot; and spiritually belongs to the Archbishop of Manila. Franciscan friars Juan Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa founded Meycauayan in 1578, and for a time it was the capital of the province of Meycauayan (which differs from Western Bulacan, administered by Augustinian Order since 1572). The Meycauayan people were able to flourish and became so rich that their sons were six of the best in the then-Province of Meycauayan. These were the towns of Bocaue, Polo, San Jose del Monte, Santa Maria de Pandi, Obando and Marilao).
During the General Visitation of October 5, 1762, by Don Simón de Anda y Salazar, the province was headed by Capitan Don Jose Pasarin, &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; of the province. 1795–96, Don Manuel Piñon was the alcalde mayor. 

In the same year, British occupation of Manila happened, and many Tagalog refugees from Manila &amp; north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and to neighboring Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them. Bulacan, along with Nueva Ecija, was natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived. Majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly-arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Bulacan dominantly Tagalog.

In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war. 

By the end of the 1700s, Bulacan had 16,586 native families and 2,007 Spanish Filipino families.

According to the &quot;Guia de 1839&quot;, Bulacan province on the island of Luzon, Philippines, was governed by a mayor and consisted of 19 pueblos, 36,394 tributes and 181,970 souls. D. Felipe Gobantes, &quot;Alcalde&quot; of the province of Bulacan erected a stone column in the plaza of Bulacan in Memory of Fr. Manuel Blanco O.S.A. who died on April 1, 1845.

In 1848, when the boundaries of Pampanga were changed, the region, which includes the important town of &quot;San Miguel de Mayumo&quot; and neighboring places that were formerly part of Pampanga, was adjudicated to Bulacan.

====The Philippine Revolution====

In an earlier period during 1890, Malolos was a hot spot of Liberal &quot;Ilustrados&quot;, notably the &quot;20 Women of Malolos&quot;, who exerted pressure for education under Filipino professors. However, the first phase of the revolution ceased in 1897 with the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel. Under its terms, the leaders of the revolution were to go to Hong Kong and reside there. Under the illusory peace created by the pact, the end of 1897 saw greater determination on the part of the Filipinos to carry on the revolutionary struggle.

In early 1898, the provinces of Zambales, Ilocos, Pampanga, Bulacan, Laguna, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, and Camarines rose again. In Central Luzon, a revolutionary government was organized under General Francisco Macabulos, a Kapampangan revolutionary leader of La Paz, Tarlac. 

Pandi was, in 1896-97, with the &quot;Kakarong Republic&quot;, the early epicenter of revolutionary fevor. Despite its defeat in the Battle of Kakarong de Sili, the memory of the Kakarong defenders still remain as part of the history and heritage of Bulacan as the first organized revolutionary government established in the era of the Revolution.

=== American colonial period ===
The Americans established a local Philippine government in the Philippines when they held the first municipal election in the country in Baliwag on May 6, 1899. At the beginning of the American rule, 1899–1900, Malolos became the headquarters of the Military Governor of the Philippines at Casa Real. On February 27, 1901, the Philippine Commission officially transferred the seat of government to Malolos, and the &quot;Casa Real de Malolos&quot; was the seat of the Provincial Governor from 1900 to 1930 until the completion of the capitol building at Guinhawa, Malolos.

=== Japanese occupation ===
In 1942, at the height of World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army occupied Bulacan and made &quot;Casa Real de Malolos&quot; its headquarters. In 1945, combined Filipino and American forces and local guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial Forces and liberated Bulacan.

After the war, Bulacan was embroiled in the Hukbalahap Rebellion. In February 1945, Huk Squadron 77 composed of 109 veteran guerillas was surrounded, shot, and buried in a mass grave in Malolos.

=== Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Bulacan. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. 

By this time, the social unrest of the pre-martial law period and the Marcos&#x27; violent responses to the protests of the time led many of the Philippines&#x27; youth, who previously held moderate positions calling for political reform, to be radicalized. Some were convinced to joined the newly-formed New People&#x27;s Army as a last desperate way to resist Marcos&#x27; authoritarianism. On June 21, 1982, a group of young activists opposing the Marcos dictatorship tried to help farmers form a local chapter of Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Gitnang Luzon (AMLG). They were arrested by armed soldiers from the 175th Philippine Constabulary Company and were found dead the following day in San Rafael, Bulacan. The name of the so-called Bulacan Martyrs was added to the Bantayog ng mga Bayani&#x27;s &#x27;Wall of Remembrance&#x27; in 2012.

=== Move of Valenzuela to Metro Manila ===
Through &quot;Presidential Decree № 824&quot;, Bulacan was partitioned on November 7, 1975, to form the National Capital Region. The municipality of Valenzuela was excised to form the new region, while the other 25 towns remained in Bulacan.

====Issues concerning the foundation date====
To determine the tentative date of Bulacan&#x27;s foundation and to trace its roots from colonial period, efforts and research conducted by Jaime Veneracion, Reynaldo Naguit of the Center for Bulacan Studies, and Isagani Giron of the &quot;Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan&quot; (Sampaka) shows that Bulacan was identified as a visita of Tondo in 1578.

With regards to exact date of foundation of Bulacan as a province, Veneracion correlated it with the Spanish practice of dedicating the founding of a &quot;pueblo&quot; to the feast of a patron saint. In the case of Bulacan it is the &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion&quot;, which is also the patron saint of Bulakan town, the first capital of the province. Officially, the province of Bulacan was created under &quot;Act 2711&quot; on March 10, 1917.

==Geography==
Bulacan covers a total area of occupying the southeastern section of the Central Luzon region. The province is bounded by Nueva Ecija (San Isidro, Gapan, General Tinio) on the north, Aurora (Dingalan) on the northeast, Quezon (General Nakar) on the east, Rizal (Rodriguez) on the southeast, Metro Manila (Valenzuela City, Malabon, Navotas, Caloocan and Quezon City) on the south, Manila Bay on the southwest, and Pampanga (Candaba, San Luis, Apalit, Macabebe, Masantol) on the west.

Several rivers irrigate the province of Bulacan; the largest one is that of Angat. Angat River passes through the towns of Norzagaray, Angat, Bustos, San Rafael, Baliwag, Plaridel, Pulilan, and Calumpit. It flows thence into the Pampanga River, goes out again, washes Hagonoy, and loses itself in the mangroves. The banks of these rivers are very fertile and are covered with trees.

===Terrain===
Bulacan lies in the southern portion of the fertile plains of Central Luzon. The area is drained by the Angat and Pampanga rivers. The Sierra Madre mountain range forms the highlands of Bulacan in the east and is a protected area known as the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve. Angat Lake, which was formed by the Angat Dam is located in that area. The highest point in the province at is Mount Oriod, part of the Sierra Madre.

On January 19, 2008, an dump site, a new landfill that would also be a tourist attraction opened in Norzagaray. Ramon Angelo Jr., president Waste Custodian Management Corp. stated: &quot;I want them to see our system in our place which should not be abhorred because we are using the new state-of-the-art technology.&quot;

===Climate===
November to April is generally dry while wet for the rest of the year. The northeast monsoon (&quot;amihan&quot;) prevails from October to January bringing in moderated and light rains. From February to April, the east trade winds predominate but the Sierra Madre (Philippines) mountain range to the east disrupts the winds resulting to a dry period. From May to September, the southwest monsoon (&quot;habagat&quot;).

The hottest month is May with an average temperature of while the coldest is February with an average temperature of .

===Administrative divisions===
Bulacan is subdivided into 20 municipalities and 4 cities. As the population is concentrated in the southern half of the province, so are the legislative districts.



==Demographics==
The population of Bulacan in the 2020 census was 3,708,890 people, making it the second most populous province in the country, only behind from Cavite, which is also located in Luzon. It had a density of , the country&#x27;s 4th highest for a province.

On May 1, 2010, the province had 2,924,433 inhabitants with an annual population growth rate of 2.73 from the year 2000 to 2010, There were 588,693 households in the province with an average size of 4.8 persons. Bulacan had a median age of 23 years in 2007.

===Languages and ethnicities===
As it is part of the Tagalog cultural sphere (&quot;Katagalugan&quot;), Tagalog is the predominant language of Bulacan. The Tagalog dialect spoken in Bulacan resembles a poetic form of speech. Some inhabitants also speak Kapampangan, especially in areas close to the border of Pampanga. Bulacan Tagalog itself contains many loanwords of Kapampangan origin. Like mentioned aboved, Bulacan was natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived, but when British invaded Manila, the province became dominantly Tagalog after many Tagalog refugees from Manila and northern areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them and assimilated to them. Many place names of Kapampangan origin are evident in the province, like Malolos, Baliwag, Guiguinto, Pandi, Quingwa (former name of Plaridel), &amp; San Miguel de Mayumo. Three municipalities (San Miguel, Doña Remedios Trinidad, and Norzagaray) and one city (San Jose del Monte) are the homelands of the Alta Kabulowan (also known as Dumagat people), the first inhabitants of Bulacan, whose language is also called Alta Kabulowan. Their language is currently endangered due to a present influx of Tagalog speakers. Being bordered by Metro Manila from its south, people from farther provinces settled in Bulacan, resulting in minor but significant usage of non-native languages in the province such as Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Maranao, Maguindanaon, Tausug, Ilocano, Pangasinan and Bicolano.

San Jose del Monte, Santa Maria, Malolos, Marilao, San Miguel and Norzagaray bear the highest numbers of English speakers in the province.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
Roman Catholic (89.44%) is the predominant religion in the province. Malolos City is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos, with its mother church, the Minor Basilica and Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. On March 21, 2021, Sta. Maria Church was also granted the status of Minor Basilica by Pope Francis. It became Bulacan&#x27;s second Minor Basilica and the 18th in the Philippines.

====Others====
Other Christian groups include the Members Church of God International (MCG), Iglesia ni Cristo (3.29%), Evangelicals (1.53%), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.37%), Bible Baptist Church (0.30%), Muslims (0.21%), Seventh-day Adventists (0.21%), and Aglipayans (0.17%), and other small numbers of Christians and non-Christian groups are also present.

== Transportation ==

Bulacan is dubbed as &quot;The Gateway to the Northern Philippines&quot;. The province is linked with Metro Manila primarily through the North Luzon Expressway and Manila North Road (better known as the MacArthur Highway) which crosses the province into Pampanga and western part of Northern Luzon (western Central Luzon, Ilocos and Cordillera Administrative Region). While taking the Cagayan Valley Road in Guiguinto, the road leads to Nueva Ecija and to the eastern part of Northern Luzon (eastern Central Luzon and Cagayan Valley Region). Bulacan will be accessed by the future C-6 Road connecting the provinces of Rizal and Cavite and the cities of Taguig, Parañaque and Muntinlupa in Metro Manila.

The proposed North Luzon East Expressway (NLEE) is the future expressway link between Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan and Nueva Ecija. It will also serve as a new alternate route of motorists coming from Manila going to Aurora and Cagayan Valley region.

The MacArthur Highway traverses the province from north to south. Most major towns can be reached through the North Luzon Expressway. A good number of motor vehicles owned largely by private individuals provide mobility to Bulacan&#x27;s populace. Aside from five main highways that traverse the province, all roads are widely dispersed throughout Bulacan.

Bus terminals of Baliwag Transit Inc., Golden Bee Transport and Logistics Corp., California Bus Line, Sampaguita Liner, and Royal Eagle are in Baliwag, Balagtas and Hagonoy.

The ruins of the station in Guiguinto town, Bulacan province, will be among the structures that will be preserved. The structures in the city and in the towns of Balagtas, Guiguinto, Malolos, and Calumpit would also be renovated to complement the design of the new railway stations.

Junn Magno, PNR general manager, said 10 structures left standing from the old stations would be restored to give a glimpse of the PNR&#x27;s history.

The San Miguel Corporation&#x27;s proposed Bulacan Airport, dubbed as New Manila International Airport, involves the construction of a brand-new international airport and is being positioned as an alternative to the congested NAIA in Manila.

<doc id="252411" wikidata="Q878628" url="?curid=252411" title="List of governors of Kansas">
<text>The governor of Kansas is the head of state of Kansas and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Kansas Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, and to grant pardons.

Since becoming a state, Kansas has had 48 governors. The state&#x27;s longest-serving governors were Robert Docking, John W. Carlin, and Bill Graves, each of whom served 8 years (Docking served four two-year terms; Carlin and Graves each served 2 4-year terms). The shortest-serving governor was John McCuish, who served only 11 days after the resignation of Fred Hall.

The current governor is Democrat Laura Kelly, who took office on January 14, 2019.

== List of governors ==

=== Kansas Territory ===
Kansas Territory was organized on May 30, 1854, from land that had previously been part of Missouri Territory. Despite existing only for six years, it had six governors appointed by the president of the United States.

=== State of Kansas ===

The eastern bulk of Kansas Territory was admitted to the Union as Kansas on January 29, 1861. The Kansas Constitution provided that a governor and lieutenant governor be elected every 2 years, for a term commencing on the second Monday in the January after the election. An amendment in 1972 increased terms to four years, with a limit that a governor could not serve more than two terms in a row, and provided that the governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. In the original constitution, should the office of governor be vacant, the powers would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, who nonetheless would remain in that office; the 1972 amendment changed it so that, in such an event, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.

Until 2018, there was no age or residency requirement to run for the office; in 2017, three teenagers were doing so. In 2018, a law was passed establishing the age to run for governor and lieutenant governor at 25.

<doc id="252412" wikidata="Q2737865" url="?curid=252412" title="Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)">
<text>Luis Emilio Gonzalez (born September 3, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Gonzo&quot;, is an American former baseball outfielder who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven teams. Gonzalez spent his best years with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was one of the most popular players in the organization&#x27;s history. His game-winning hit in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera clinched the Diamondbacks&#x27; first and only World Series championship to date. Gonzalez was a five-time All-Star and won a Silver Slugger Award in 2001. In addition to good power (354 career home runs), Gonzalez was known as an exceptional gap hitter. His 596 career doubles currently rank 19th on the all-time MLB list.

After retiring from baseball in 2008, Gonzalez joined the Diamondbacks&#x27; front office in 2009 as a special assistant to the president. The following year, the team retired his uniform number #20, making him the first player so honored by the Diamondbacks.

==Early life==
Gonzalez grew up in the West Tampa neighborhood of Tampa, Florida in a Cuban-American household. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1985 along with childhood friend Tino Martinez.

==College career==
After high school, he attended the University of South Alabama, where he earned Baseball America&#x27;s &quot;All-Freshman Second Team&quot; honors. He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the fourth round of the 1988 amateur draft. Gonzalez played American Legion Baseball for Post 248. Other Post 248 alumni include Lou Piniella, Tony La Russa, Tino Martinez, and Gary Sheffield.

Gonzalez hit .312 with 5 home runs and 10 doubles in 39 games for Auburn before being promoted to the Asheville Tourists to finish the season.

Gonzalez made his major league debut on September 4, 1990. He finished the rest of the 1990 season with four hits (two doubles). The year of 1991 became the first full season of Gonzalez&#x27;s career. During 1991, he batted .254 with 13 home runs and 69 RBI. In 1992, he batted .243 with 10 home runs and 55 RBI.

Overall in 1995, Gonzalez had a .276 average, 13 homers and 69 RBI combined while he played with the Astros and Cubs. In 1996, Gonzalez batted .271 with 15 homers and 79 RBI.

===Second stint with the Houston Astros (1997)===
Gonzalez signed a one-year deal to return to the Astros in 1997. During 1997, he batted .258 with 10 homers and 68 RBI.

===Detroit Tigers (1998)===
Gonzalez signed a one-year deal for the Tigers in 1998. In 1998, he batted .267 with 23 homers and 71 RBI. He hit the first home run at Tropicana Field (the home stadium of the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays) on Opening Day.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (1999–2006)===
In 1999, Gonzalez was traded to the Diamondbacks for Karim García. He had a strong debut season for Arizona on his way to becoming a star during his tenure with the team, leading the NL in hits with 206 and posting a .336 batting average to help them win the National League&#x27;s western division. Arizona would fall to the New York Mets in the divisional playoff series. Gonzalez was selected to his first All-Star Team in 1999. In 2000, the Diamondbacks fell to third place in their division, but Gonzalez had a fine season, blasting 31 home runs among his 192 hits, while hitting .311 and driving in 114 runs.

In 2001, Gonzalez astonished many when he hit 57 home runs, his personal best for one season and almost twice as many as he hit in any other season. This included a record nine home runs in his first 10 games (shared with Mike Schmidt in 1976). The total is the third-most in National League history for a left-handed batter (behind Barry Bonds&#x27;s record 73, which also came in 2001, and Ryan Howard, who hit 58 in 2006). Gonzalez was selected to his second All-Star Team and won the Home Run Derby at the mid-season classic. He ranked second in the National League in hits with 198, while batting .325 and posting career highs in runs (128), RBI (142) and walks (100). He finished third in the 2001 NL Most Valuable Player voting.

The Diamondbacks reached the World Series that year and faced off against the New York Yankees, who featured Gonzalez&#x27;s childhood friend Tino Martinez starting at first base. In a climactic moment, Gonzalez came to the plate in the bottom of the 9th inning of game 7, with the score even at 2–2, the bases loaded and one out. The Yankee pitcher was Mariano Rivera, widely regarded as one of the best closers of all time (Rivera had never blown a save chance in a World Series before, or since). Gonzalez swung at Rivera&#x27;s 0–1 pitch and hit the game-winning bloop single into left field that sealed the first franchise World Series title for Arizona.

He was also selected to All-Star Teams in 2002 and 2003. During the 2002 season, Gonzalez received publicity as a piece of gum chewed by Gonzalez during a spring training game was sold for $10,000 on April 15, 2002. The buyer was Curt Mueller, owner of Mueller Sports Medicine Inc., manufacturer of the gum, Quench. In 2003, Gonzalez topped .300 (.304) for the fourth time in his first five seasons in Arizona, and eclipsed 100 RBI (104) for the fifth consecutive season.

On May 22, 2004, Gonzalez got his 2,000th career hit in a game against the Florida Marlins, though his season ended early when he had Tommy John surgery in August. In 2005, he was selected to his fifth All-Star Team. On April 18, 2006, he got his 500th career double, becoming the 20th player in Major League history to hit 500 doubles and 300 home runs. On May 13, 2006, he passed Babe Ruth for 38th place all-time for the most doubles hit in league history.

On June 15, 2006, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; printed an interview by columnist E. J. Montini with Diamondback managing general partner Ken Kendrick. In the interview, Kendrick mentioned whispers of alleged steroid use by Gonzalez; in the interview Kendrick never directly accused Gonzalez of using performance-enhancing drugs. The interview came eight days after Diamondback relief pitcher Jason Grimsley was released by the team after the team learned that federal agents had searched his home looking for evidence that he was a distributor of human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing drugs. On June 16, 2006, an angry Gonzalez called a press conference to deny that he had ever used steroids.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2007)===
On September 14, 2006, the Diamondbacks announced that they would not pick up the team option of $10 million to re-sign Gonzalez after the 2006 season. On December 7, Gonzalez signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for $7 million for the 2007 season.

Gonzalez hit his first home run as a Dodger on Sunday, April 8, 2007, versus Barry Zito of the San Francisco Giants. He hit two home runs in that game. In his only season with the Dodgers, he was productive offensively, but struggled defensively. Many times throughout the season, he was benched for a defensive replacement. Towards the end of the season, he was benched in favor of Matt Kemp, a top Dodger prospect at the time. He was upset about it and publicly said he was not interested in returning to the Dodgers before the season was even over. He hit .278 with 15 home runs and 68 RBI in 2007.

Gonzalez was the first player to hit a home run off of the touch tank on June 24, in Tropicana Field.

===Florida Marlins (2008)===

On February 7, 2008, he signed with the Florida Marlins. The deal was reportedly worth $2 million for one season. Gonzalez played in 136 games for the Marlins in 2008, batting .261.

===Retirement===
Gonzalez announced his retirement on August 29, 2009, and joined the Diamondbacks front office as a special assistant to the president. In 2010, Gonzalez&#x27;s number 20 jersey was retired on August 7, making him the first player to have his number retired by the team.

===Career statistics===
In 2,591 games over 19 seasons, Gonzalez posted a .283 batting average (2,591-for-9,157) with 1,412 runs, 596 doubles, 68 triples, 354 home runs, 1,439 RBI, 1,155 bases on balls, 128 stolen bases, .367 on-base percentage and .479 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage primarily as a left fielder. In 24 postseason games, he hit .253 (22-for-87) with 12 runs, 3 doubles, 4 home runs, 12 RBI and 11 walks.

As a resident of Arizona, he wrote a letter of endorsement for Arizona&#x27;s Junior Senator, Jon Kyl, who won his bid for re-election in 2006. He endorsed Arizona&#x27;s other Senator, 2008 GOP Presidential Nominee John McCain, over former congressman J.D. Hayworth in 2010. In 2022 he endorsed Kari Lake for the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election. Gonzalez was the Celebrity face for a cornfield maze in Queen Creek, Arizona for the Schnepf Farms&#x27; annual Celebrity Maze.

<doc id="252415" wikidata="Q878590" url="?curid=252415" title="List of governors of West Virginia">
<text>The governor of West Virginia is the head of government of West Virginia and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the West Virginia Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, and, except when prosecution has been carried out by the House of Delegates, to grant pardons and reprieves.

Since West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863, during the American Civil War, 35 men have served as governor . Two, Arch A. Moore Jr. (West Virginia&#x27;s 28th and 30th governor) and Cecil H. Underwood (West Virginia&#x27;s 25th and 32nd governor), served two nonconsecutive terms in office. The longest-serving governor was Moore, who served for three terms over twelve years. The state&#x27;s first governor after admission into the Union, Arthur I. Boreman, served the most consecutive terms, resigning a week before the end of his third term. Before the state&#x27;s admission, Francis Harrison Pierpont, the &quot;Father of West Virginia,&quot; was elected governor during the Wheeling Convention of 1861. Daniel D.T. Farnsworth was senate president at the time; he filled the last seven days of Boreman&#x27;s term and remains the shortest-serving governor. Underwood has the unusual distinction of being both the youngest person to be elected as governor (age 34 upon his first term in 1957) and the oldest to both be elected and serve (age 74 upon his second term in 1997; age 78 at the end of his second term in 2001). The current governor is Republican Patrick Morrisey, who assumed office on January 13, 2025.

To serve as governor, a person must be at least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of West Virginia for at least five years at the time of inauguration. Under the current Constitution of West Virginia, ratified in 1872, the governor serves a four-year term commencing on the third Wednesday in January, following an election. The original constitution of 1863 only called for a two-year term. Since 1968, a governor may be reelected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. Any partial term served counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.

The constitution makes no mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the senate president stands first in the line of succession. If more than one year remains in the governor&#x27;s term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held for the balance of the term. If less than a year remains, the senate president acts as governor for the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the senate president the honorary title of lieutenant governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the senate president do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the senate president will be the speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state at the time of the vacancy.

==Qualifications==
Anyone who seeks to be elected Governor of West Virginia must meet the following qualifications:
*Be a citizen of the United States
*Be a resident of West Virginia for at least five years preceding the election
*Be a duly qualified elector of West Virginia
*Be at least 30 years old

<text>The governor of Illinois is the head of government of the U.S. state of Illinois. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Illinois&#x27;s state government and is charged with enforcing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Illinois Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces.

Since becoming a state in 1818, 43 people have served as governor of Illinois; before statehood, it had only one territorial governor, Ninian Edwards. The longest-serving governor was James R. Thompson, who was elected to four terms lasting 14 years, from 1977 to 1991. Only one governor, Richard J. Oglesby, has served multiple non-consecutive terms, having been elected in 1864, 1872, and 1884.

The current governor is J. B. Pritzker, who took office on January 14, 2019.

==List of governors==

===Territory of Illinois===
Illinois Territory was formed on March 1, 1809, from Indiana Territory. It had only two governors appointed by the president of the United States before it became a state, and only one ever took office.

===State of Illinois===
Illinois was admitted to the Union on December 3, 1818, consisting of the southern portion of Illinois Territory; the remainder was assigned to Michigan Territory.

The first Illinois Constitution, ratified in 1818, provided that a governor be elected every 4 years for a term starting on the first Monday in the December following an election. The constitution of 1848 moved the start of the term to the second Monday in January starting in 1849, thus shortening the term won in the 1844 election to 2 years. Governors were not allowed to succeed themselves until the 1870 constitution, which removed this limit.

The office of lieutenant governor was created in the first constitution, to exercise the power of governor if that office becomes vacant. The 1848 constitution changed this to say the power &quot;devolves&quot; upon the lieutenant governor in case of a vacancy. The current constitution of 1970 made it so that, in the event of a vacancy, the lieutenant becomes governor, and the governor and lieutenant governor are now elected on the same ticket. If the governor feels seriously impeded in performing their job, they can inform the secretary of state and the next in the line of succession, who becomes acting governor until the governor can resume office.

<doc id="252421" wikidata="Q41615" url="?curid=252421" title="Heraclius Constantine">
<text>Heraclius Constantine (; ; 3 May 612 – 25 May 641), often enumerated as Constantine III, was one of the shortest reigning Byzantine emperors, ruling for three months in 641. He was the eldest son of Emperor Heraclius and his first wife Fabia Eudokia.

== Reign ==
Constantine was crowned co-emperor by his father on 22 January 613 and shortly after was betrothed to his cousin, Gregoria, a daughter of his father&#x27;s first cousin, Nicetas. As the couple were second cousins, the marriage was technically incestuous, but this consideration must have been outweighed by the advantages of the match to the family as a whole. Furthermore, its illegality paled into insignificance beside Heraclius&#x27; marriage to his niece Martina the same year. In comparison, Constantine&#x27;s marriage was far less scandalous than that of his father. Constantine assumed an honorary consulship on 1 January 632, and at the same ceremony his brother Heraclonas was raised to the rank of &quot;Caesar&quot;.

Constantine became senior emperor when his father died on 11 February 641. He reigned together with his younger half-brother Heraclonas, the son of Martina. His supporters feared action against him on the part of Martina and Heraclonas, and the treasurer Philagrius advised him to write to the army, informing them that he was dying and asking for their assistance in protecting the rights of his children. He also sent a vast sum of money, more than two million &quot;solidi&quot; (gold coins), to Valentinus, an adjutant of Philagrius, to distribute to the soldiers to persuade them to secure the succession for his sons after his death. He died of tuberculosis after only three months, on 25 May, leaving Heraclonas sole emperor. A rumor that Martina had him poisoned led first to the imposition of Constans II as co-emperor and then to the deposition, mutilation, and banishment of Martina and her sons.

== Family ==
In 629 or 630, Constantine married Gregoria, the daughter of Niketas. They had two sons, and perhaps a daughter: 
* Constans II, who succeeded as emperor
* Theodosius

== Regnal name ==
The Romans themselves did not use regnal numbers, which are instead applied to the emperors by modern historians. There is particular confusion surrounding the name &quot;Constantine III&quot; as it has been also applied to the earlier Western emperor Constantine (407–411), who started as a usurper but was later recognized by Honorius (395–423). Charles le Beau (1701–1778), who established the convention of numbering eleven Constantines, uses the numeral only for the Eastern emperor. Edward Gibbon (1737–1794) also explicitly refers to the Western emperor as a usurper and gives the numeral to the Eastern one. Justin Sabatier (1792–1869) and Louis Félicien de Saulcy (1807–1880) notably enumerate Heraclius Constantine as &quot;Heraclius II&quot;, a numeral often used for his brother Heraclonas, but refer to the next Constantine as Constantine IV, thus indirectly counting the Western emperor. This numbering has been followed by a few authors. Warwick Wroth (1858–1911) uses no numeral for Heraclius Constantine and uses &quot;Constantine III&quot; as an alternative name for Constans II. The &quot;Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire (PLRE)&quot; (1980) uses the numeral solely for the Eastern emperor, while the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium&quot; (1991) uses it solely for the Western one. Philip Grierson (1910–2006) applies the numeral to both emperors, but treats &quot;Constantine III&quot; more like an alternate name for Heraclius Constantine, who is not given a numeral in the index. The &quot;Roman Imperial Coinage (RIC)&quot;, which ends with the fall of the West, uses the numeral for the Western emperor, which has now become standard. Strangely enough, both Constantines had a son called Constans. Neither the &quot;RIC&quot;, &quot;PLRE&quot; nor Grierson give the Western one a numeral, yet he&#x27;s still often called &quot;Constans II&quot;.

<doc id="252426" wikidata="Q17015376" url="?curid=252426" title="Games played with Go equipment">
<text>Many games can be played with [[Go equipment]]: a supply of white and black &quot;stones&quot; and a board with 19×19 intersections, other than Go and many more can be played with minor modification.

Games that can be played without modification on the intersections of a 19×19 Go board include:

* Breakthrough, which can be played on just about any board shape one wishes
* Gomoku, ninuki-renju and its close relative pente
* Connect6, similar to naughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe), but requires connecting six in a row, and with two stones per move
* Gonnect
* Capture go
* Alea evangelii

Games that can be played without modification on the intersections of a Go board reduced in size (perhaps by masking the unwanted sections with paper or tape) include:

* Alak, a Go-like game restricted to a single spatial dimension (1×19)
* Five-field kono (5x5)
* Renju (15×15)
* Philosopher&#x27;s football (15×19)
* Cinc camins
* Some games of gonu
Games that can be played without modification on the &quot;squares&quot; of a Go board reduced in size include:

* Gess (18×18 squares—no reduction required)
* Crossings (8×8 squares)
* Epaminondas (12×14 squares)
* Lines of action (8×8 squares)
* Connect Four (most commonly 7×6 squares)
* Seega (game) (5×5, 7×7 or 9×9 squares)
* Four-field kono
* Reversi and Othello
* Yoté and Choko (game)
* Several tafl games

It&#x27;s also possible to use Go equipment as a low-tech interface to Conway&#x27;s game of life; use black stones in the board&#x27;s squares as &#x27;pixels&#x27;, and for each generation use white stones to indicate where new cells will be born. Then remove &#x27;dead&#x27; black stones, replace the white stones with black ones to complete the new generation, and repeat the process.

<text>William of Poitiers (, ; 10201090) was a Norman priest who served as the chaplain of Duke William II of Normandy (William the Conqueror), for whom he chronicled the Norman conquest of England in his &quot;Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of William, Duke of the Normans and King of the English&quot;). He had trained as a soldier before taking holy orders.

==Life==
Little is known about William of Poitiers, with most information coming from Orderic Vitalis in his &quot;Historia Ecclesiactica&quot;, written in 1114–1115 and 1125. He was apparently born in Les Préaux, France, near Pont-Audemer to an influential knightly Norman family, probably about 1020. According to Orderic, William originally trained as a knight, which gave him a much greater insight into the details of war than the typical medieval clerical writer. About 1049 he decided to enter the church, turning away from his knightly duties. Once he turned to the priesthood, William studied at the renowned school of Saint Hilaire-le-Grand in Poitiers and was said by Orderic to have returned to Normandy &#x27;more learned than all his friends and neighbours&#x27;.

William was given positions of ecclesiastical authority, becoming chaplain to Duke William and archdeacon of Lisieux. However, he doesn&#x27;t appear in any ecclesiastical or royal and ducal charters as might be expected from someone of such a position, which perhaps casts doubts over Orderic&#x27;s account of William of Poitiers life.
Little is known about his old age, and he probably retired into a religious house, or possibly political disgrace. This is implied by Orderic&#x27;s statement that William of Poitiers was forced to stop writing his history of William the Conqueror due to ″unfavorable circumstances″, of which we do not know the nature. Possible links between William of Poitiers and Duke William&#x27;s rebellious son Robert can be found, and may therefore provide an explanation for this.

==&quot;Gesta Guillelmi&quot;==
William of Poitiers wrote the Gesta Guillelmi some time after 1066. It tells the story of how Duke William prepared for, and achieved, the Conquest of England. It also justifies William&#x27;s succession to the English throne. The bulk of the writing probably took place between 1071 and 1077.

The Gesta Guillelmi is the earliest extended biography of any Duke of Normandy, and is an invaluable source for the Battle of Hastings in 1066. William of Poitiers was well placed to write the Gesta Guillelmi, being both trained as a military knight and serving as a chaplain within Duke William&#x27;s household.
There are no surviving manuscripts of the &#x27;Gesta Guillemi&#x27;. André Duchesne published an edition in 1619, although even his (now lost) manuscript was missing its beginning and end. Its present form covers the period from 1047 to 1068, and both starts and finishes mid-sentence. There is also some retrospective material concerning affairs in England after Cnut’s death (1035). Orderic Vitalis says that it originally finished in 1071. The Gesta Guillelmi is most valuable as a source for the Battle of Hastings, probably based on first-hand oral evidence.

The &#x27;History&#x27; also serves as a panegyric to William the Conqueror. R. Allen Brown writes: &quot;Within the panegyric there is a wealth of facts and details... most derived from personal knowledge and personal contacts, compiled and intelligently put together by a man uniquely qualified as both clerk and knight, closely connected with the court ... One may add that William of Poitiers must have known his hero from their joint youth up, and stress that as both former knight and former chaplain of the duke he is able to bring us closer to the heart of Normandy in the mid-eleventh century than any other writer of that age or later.&quot;

==Critiques of the Gesta Guillelmi==
William of Poitiers undoubtedly thought of himself as an historian. He mentions in the Gesta Guillelmi that the duty of a historian is to remain within the &#x27;bounds of the truth.&#x27;; but he failed to obey this rule. Antonia Gransden in &#x27;Historical writing in England c. 550 to c. 1307&#x27; shows that William of Poitiers was just as much a panegyrist as a historian. She summarises Gesta Guillelmi as &#x27;biased, unreliable account of events, and unrealistic portraits of the two principle protagonists.&#x27; Moreover, Orderic Vitalis, who uses the Gesta Guillelmi as his principal source in creating his &#x27;Ecclesiastical History&#x27;, chooses to omit or contradict many of Poitiers&#x27; passages in the Guesta Guillelmi, including denial of King William&#x27;s mercy to the conquered English; having been brought up in England from 1075–1085, Orderic knew better. However, the Gesta Guillelmi cannot be dismissed; most of the panegyrical passages are easy to isolate, and there is a lot of material that William of Poitiers probably reports accurately.

==What it tells us==

===Anglo-Saxon society===
William of Poitiers details the life of Duke William. Nonetheless, there are a few major insights into pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon society. For example, William of Poitiers reports that a Danish raiding party returned from England with &#x27;great booty&#x27;. Furthermore, Harold is said to have had &#x27;abundant treasure with which to tempt dukes&#x27;. This may explain the numerous attacks England suffered during the 10thearly 11th century.
William of Poitiers believed that the pre-Conquest English &#x27;all showed love of their country&#x27;, suggesting some sort of national identity that was lacking in Normandy.

===Norman society===
William of Poitiers provides a picture of Norman France prior to 1066. The various rebellions Duke William faced in his early reign are detailed in what was a fractured Duchy. The local Norman lords constantly waging private wars contrasts with the relatively stable Anglo-Saxon Kingdom across the Channel. The domestic turbulence forced Duke William to confront and subdue his nobility, sometimes by co-operation than coercion; for example, despite revolting against Duke William, the Gesta Guillemi states that Guy of Burgundy was allowed to remain in his court.
William of Poitiers shows that the Norman castle was an important element of society. An effective Duke could use them as strategic power bases, stamping their authority on the rural Duchy; however, a castle could also be a rallying point for rebellious nobles. William of Poitiers reports many a ducal siege as a result.

===Medieval literary tradition===
As a eulogising text, William of Poitiers&#x27;s history constantly highlights William&#x27;s admirable qualities, for example that the Duke &#x27;excelled in intelligence, assiduity, and strength&#x27;. For William of Poitiers, Duke William embodies the perfect ideals of knighthood, as illustrated by improbable stories scattered through his history; for example he states that William, with 50 of his knights, fought and bested a force of 1000. This represents a clear exaggeration. 
William of Poitiers also relates Duke William&#x27;s exploits to those of the Greek and Roman world. For example, there is a lengthy comparison between William and Julius Caesar’s (attempted) conquest of Britain. Not only was this done to flatter Duke William but also shows William of Poitiers&#x27; own knowledge.

===Battle of Hastings===
The Gesta Guillelmi provides the traditional narrative of the Battle of Hastings. William of Poitiers gives detailed descriptions of the composition of both the Norman and Anglo Saxon armies. Furthermore, he describes the famous &#x27;feigned flight&#x27; manoeuvre.

<text>The governor of Maine is the head of government of Maine and the commander-in-chief of its military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Maine Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, and, except in cases of impeachment, to grant pardons.

There have been 71 governors of Maine since statehood, serving 75 distinct terms. Four governors served multiple non-consecutive terms (Edward Kent, John Fairfield, John W. Dana, and Burton M. Cross). The longest-serving governor was Joseph E. Brennan, who served two terms from 1979 to 1987. The shortest-serving governors were Nathaniel M. Haskell and Richard H. Vose, who each served only one day. John W. Dana also served for one day in 1844, after the incumbent governor resigned, but was later elected to the governorship. The current governor is Democrat Janet Mills, who took office on January 2, 2019.

==Governors==
The District of Maine of Massachusetts was admitted to the Union on March 15, 1820, as the State of Maine. The Maine Constitution of 1820 originally established a gubernatorial term of one year, to begin on the first Wednesday of January; constitutional amendments expanded this to two years in 1879 and to four years in 1957. The 1957 amendment also prohibited governors from succeeding themselves after serving two terms. The constitution does not establish an office of lieutenant governor; a vacancy in the office of governor is filled by the president of the Maine Senate. Prior to an amendment in 1964, the president of the senate only acted as governor.

<doc id="252432" wikidata="Q6408194" url="?curid=252432" title="Kilsby Tunnel">
<text>The Kilsby Tunnel is a railway tunnel on the West Coast Main Line in England, near the village of Kilsby in Northamptonshire, roughly 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Rugby. It is long. 

The Kilsby Tunnel was designed and engineered by Robert Stephenson for the London &amp; Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR). It was constructed by contractors Joseph Nowell &amp; Sons and later by the L&amp;BR. It took much longer to construct and exceeded its estimated cost, attributed to a roof collapse and consequential flooding. At the time of its opening in 1838, it was the longest railway tunnel ever constructed.

The tunnel had atypically large ventilation shafts, because of a lack of experience as to how much ventilation would be needed for steam locomotives to pass through. In March 1987, Kilsby Tunnel portals and its two ventilation shafts were given listed status.

==History==
===Construction===
In the 1830s, Robert Stephenson developed the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) (later known as the West Coast Main Line). After opposition from several landowners and proprietors in Northampton in July 1832, the House of Lords rejected the original bill to authorise construction of the line. Stephenson surveyed an alternative route to the west of the town that included Kilsby Tunnel. The 2,423 yard tunnel would be the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel. In May 1835, Joseph Nowell &amp; Sons was awarded the tunnel contract, which was valued at £98,988 ().

Construction proved to be less than straightforward. Within months of work commencing, the second of the working shafts was flooded because of large amounts of quicksand not revealed by trial borings into the hill. Similar problems had been encountered during the construction of Blisworth Tunnel on the Grand Union Canal a few decades earlier. Problems posed by the quicksand at tunnel level were so severe that abandoning the shaft and restarting work elsewhere was considered. Stress from the project was said to have caused Joseph Nowell&#x27;s ill-health and death. 

At the recommendation of George Stephenson, several steam-powered pumps were installed to extract water from the quicksand inside the tunnel. The pumps removed up to 2,000 gallons of water from a depth of 120 feet every minute of operation and took up to eight months. Seven more shafts were sunk to install timber cylinders to hold back the sand. During this time, multiple attempts were made to construct the tunnel&#x27;s brick lining using a raft to float men and materials into position. As a protective measure, the lining&#x27;s thickness was increased from 18 inches to in excess of two feet and straw was used to deflect and control the ingress of water to prevent wet concrete from being washed away from newly laid bricks.

An unusual feature of the tunnel is the size of its ventilation shafts, which were adapted from ten of the working shafts used during its construction. In May 1836, work started on the first of two shafts, which were 132 feet deep and 20 yards in diameter. The shafts were sunk using sequentially dug trenches around the circumference and took over a year to reach the bottom of each shaft. Its three-foot-thick walls required over one million bricks and weighed an estimated 4,034 tonnes. For aesthetic reasons both shafts are castellated. 

Author Graeme Bickerdike has speculated that, while their size is excessive in regards to providing airflow, considerable importance was placed on overcoming public perceptions and worries over personal health due to insufficient ventilation, especially in regards to the use of steam locomotives inside lengthy tunnels. Several newspapers had negatively commented on the issues, and it is likely that Stephenson would have wanted to silence critics and assuage these sentiments by visibly demonstrating how much ventilation was being provided.

===Completion and subsequent activities===
On 21 June 1838, resident engineer Charles Lean laid the final brick of the tunnel, marking its completion. It took three years, and cost £320,000 to build, () three times the original estimate. The high accident rate in the course of its construction included the deaths of 26 of the 1,250 workers. The length of time it took to build delayed the opening of the L&amp;BR. On 20 August 1838, the directors of the L&amp;BR conducted the first ever rail journey between Birmingham Curzon Street railway station and Euston railway station, London. On the way, the train briefly stopped at the tunnel so that they could marvel at the structure and meet some of the workmen. Regular services using the tunnel commenced soon after.
During early operations, train movements were controlled by two policeman, one at either end of the tunnel, who signalled the presence of a train to each other, and only one train was allowed to enter the tunnel at a time. In June 1852, a fatal collision occurred between a ballast train and a coal train as a result of signals that were either not issued or were not received.

In March 1987, both the north and south portals of Kilsby Tunnel were Grade II* listed; furthermore, the two largest ventilation shafts were also listed, the north shaft being Grade II* listed while the south shaft was Grade II listed. During the tunnel&#x27;s service life, there have been no major problems or difficulties with the structure. During a survey conducted during the 2010s, it was found to be in a largely good condition.

During the 2010s, Kilsby Tunnel was restored by Network Rail. Maintenance focused on inspecting the ventilation shafts and repairs to the brickwork of one shaft was carried out, sections of the tunnel&#x27;s lining were replaced. While unusual means of access were used because of the listed status of the shafts, the repairs were described as routine.

At the beginning of 2020, an estimated 400 trains were using the tunnel daily. Due to the drastic reduction in rail traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Network Rail took the rare opportunity to close the tunnel for two weeks in May 2020 in order to carry out major works, including replacing much of the tunnel&#x27;s drainage system, which had become clogged by heavily limed water seeping through, causing flooding problems, and also replacing much of the track and ballast. This was the longest total closure of the tunnel since it was opened, with all trains diverted temporarily via . In normal times the work would have required many short blockades, and taken months to complete. It allowed a temporary speed restriction through the tunnel of 70 mph to be lifted, enabling trains to operate at the normal line speed of 110 mph.

<text>The governor of Indiana is the head of government of the U.S. state of Indiana. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Indiana&#x27;s state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.

While a territory, Indiana had two governors appointed by the president of the United States. Since statehood in 1816, it has had 49 governors, serving 51 distinct terms; Isaac P. Gray and Henry F. Schricker are the only governors to have served non-consecutive terms. Four governors have served two four-year terms; territorial governor William Henry Harrison served for 11 years. The shortest-serving governor is Henry S. Lane, who served two days before resigning to become a U.S. senator. The current governor is Mike Braun, who took office on January 13, 2025.

==List of governors==

===Territory of Indiana===
Indiana Territory was formed on July 4, 1800, from the Northwest Territory. Despite remaining a territory for nearly 16 years, it had only two governors appointed by the president of the United States before it became a state.

===State of Indiana===
Indiana was admitted to the Union on December 11, 1816.

The original 1816 Constitution of Indiana provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every three years, limited to six years out of any nine-year period. The second and current constitution of 1851 lengthened terms to four years and set the commencement of the governor&#x27;s term on the second Monday in the January following the election. Governors were allowed to serve for four years in any eight-year period, but a 1972 amendment permitted governors to serve for eight years in any twelve-year period. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Indiana Senate becomes governor; this has happened once, when James B. Ray succeeded William Hendricks.

<doc id="252440" wikidata="Q78501" url="?curid=252440" title="Carl Ferdinand Cori">
<text>Carl Ferdinand Cori, ForMemRS (December 5, 1896 – October 20, 1984) was a Czech-American biochemist and pharmacologist. He, together with his wife Gerty Cori and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay, received a Nobel Prize in 1947 for their discovery of how the glucose derivative glycogen (animal starch) is broken down and resynthesized in the body for use as a store and source of energy. In 2004, both Coris were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of their work that elucidated carbohydrate metabolism.

== Education and early life ==
Carl Ferdinand Cori was born on December 5, 1896, in Prague, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic). Carl was the son of Carl Isidor Cori (1865, Brüx – 1954, Vienna), a zoologist, and Maria Cori (née Lippich; 1870, Graz – 1922, Prague), a daughter of the Italian-Bohemian/Austrian/Slovenian /Hungarian physician (1838, Padua – 1913, Prague).

The Cori family came from the Papal State (later the Roman Republic, today&#x27;s Central Italy) to the royal Bohemian crownland, (Monarchical Austria at the end of the 17th century). Carl Ferdinand&#x27;s grandfather Eduard Cori (18121889) was an administrative officer and beekeeper in Brüx, and his grandmother was Rosina Trinks (?1909). Carl Ferdinand&#x27;s younger sister Margarete Cori (born 1905) was a lecturer in Prague and the wife of the Bohemian geneticist Felix Mainx (1900, Prague – 1983, Vienna).

He grew up in Trieste, where his father Carl Isidor was the director of the Marine Biological Station. In late 1914 the Cori family moved to Prague and Carl entered the medical school of Charles University in Prague. While studying there he met his future wife Gerty Theresa Radnitz. He was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and served in the ski corps, and later was transferred to the sanitary corps, for which he set up a laboratory in Trieste. At the end of the war Carl completed his studies, graduating with Gerty in 1920. Carl and Gerty married that year and worked together in clinics in Vienna. Their only child, Tom, married Anne, a daughter of the American constitutional lawyer and anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly.

== Career ==
Carl was invited to Graz to work with Otto Loewi to study the effect of the vagus nerve on the heart (Loewi would receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936 for this work). While Carl was in Graz, Gerty remained in Vienna. A year later Carl was offered a position at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Diseases (now Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center) in Buffalo, New York, and the Coris moved to Buffalo. In 1928, they became naturalized citizens of the United States.

While at the Institute the Coris&#x27; research focused on carbohydrate metabolism, leading to the definition of the Cori cycle in 1929. In 1931, Carl accepted a position at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. Carl joined as professor of pharmacology and in 1942 was made professor of biochemistry. In St. Louis, the Coris continued their research on glycogen and glucose and began to describe glycogenolysis, identifying and synthesizing the important enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. For these discoveries, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947, making them the third ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize.

Gerty died in 1957 and Carl married Anne Fitzgerald-Jones (1909-2006) in 1960. He stayed on at Washington University until 1966, when he retired as chair of the biochemistry department. He was appointed visiting professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard University while maintaining a laboratory space at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he pursued research in genetics. From 1968 to 1983, he collaborated with noted geneticist Salomé Glüecksohn-Waelsch of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, until the 1980s when illness prevented him from continuing. In 1976, Carl received the Laurea honoris causa in Medicine from the University of Trieste.
Carl shares a star with Gerty on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

== Awards and honors ==
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize, Cori won the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1946 and in 1959, the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art. Cori was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1940, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1947, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1950. The Carl Cori Endowed Professorship at Washington University is named in his honor, currently held by Colin Nichols.

<doc id="252442" wikidata="Q204733" url="?curid=252442" title="Gerty Cori">
<text>Gerty Theresa Cori (; August 15, 1896 – October 26, 1957) was a Bohemian-Austrian and American biochemist who in 1947 was the third woman to win a Nobel Prize in science, and the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for her role in the &quot;discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen&quot;.

Cori was born in Prague, the capital of Bohemia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Growing up at a time when women were marginalized and allowed few educational opportunities, she gained admittance to medical school, where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori in an anatomy class. Upon their graduation in 1920, they married. Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research coauthored with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.

Together with her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay, Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen—a starch made from glucose—is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the Cori cycle). They also identified the important catalyzing compound, the Cori ester. The Coris were the third ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize. In 2004, both Gerty and Carl Cori were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of their work in clarifying carbohydrate metabolism.

In 1957, Gerty Cori died after a ten-year struggle with myelosclerosis. She remained active in the research laboratory until the end of her life. She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors.

==Early life and education==
Gerty Cori was born Gerty Theresa Radnitz into a Jewish family in Prague, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (modern Czech Republic) in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar refineries after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16, she decided she wanted to be a medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of mathematics.

Her uncle, a professor of pediatrics, encouraged her to attend medical school, so she studied for and passed the university entrance examination. She was admitted to the medical school of the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität in Prague in 1914, an unusual achievement for women at that time.

==Marriage and early career==
While studying, she met Carl Cori, who was immediately attracted to her charm, vitality, sense of humor, and her love of the outdoors and mountain climbing. Gerty and Carl had both entered medical school at 18 and both graduated in 1920. They married that same year. Gerty converted to Catholic Christianity, enabling her and Carl to marry in the Catholic Church. They moved to Vienna, capital of Austria, where Gerty spent the next two years at the Carolinen Children&#x27;s Hospital, and her husband worked in a laboratory. While at the hospital, Gerty Cori worked on the pediatrics unit and conducted experiments in temperature regulation, comparing temperatures before and after thyroid treatment, and published papers on blood disorders.

Carl was drafted into the Austrian army and served during World War I. Life was difficult after the war, and Gerty developed dry eye caused by severe malnutrition due to food shortages. These problems, in conjunction with the increasing anti-Semitism, contributed to the Coris&#x27; decision to leave Europe.

==Immigration to the United States==
In 1922, the Coris both immigrated to the United States (Gerty six months after Carl because of difficulty in obtaining a position) to pursue medical research at what later became the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. In 1928, they became naturalized citizens. The director of the institute threatened to dismiss Gerty if she did not cease collaborative research with her husband. She continued to work with Carl and was nevertheless kept on at the institute.

Although the Coris were discouraged from working together at Roswell, they continued, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized in the human body and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell. The lead author of each paper was the one who had done the most research. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle. The cycle describes how the human body uses chemical reactions to break some carbohydrates such as glycogen in muscle tissue into lactic acid, while synthesizing others.

==Washington University==
The Coris left Roswell in 1931 after publishing their work on carbohydrate metabolism. Several universities offered Carl a position but refused to hire Gerty. Gerty was informed during one university interview that it was considered &quot;un-American&quot; for a married couple to work together. Carl refused a position at the University at Buffalo because the school would not allow him to work with his wife.

In 1931, they moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when Washington University offered positions to both Carl and Gerty, although Gerty&#x27;s rank and salary were much lower than her husband&#x27;s. Despite her research experience, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might impede her husband&#x27;s career. Washington University&#x27;s Chancellor, Arthur Compton, made a special allowance for Gerty to hold a position there, ignoring the university&#x27;s nepotism rules. Gerty waited thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was appointed associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.

While working at Washington University, they discovered an intermediate compound in frog muscles that enabled the breakdown of glycogen, called glucose 1-phosphate, later known as the Cori ester. They established the compound&#x27;s structure, identified the enzyme phosphorylase that catalyzed its chemical formation, and deduced that the Cori ester is the beginning step in the conversion of the carbohydrate glycogen into glucose (breaking down energy stores into a form that can be used). It can also be the last step in the conversion of blood glucose to glycogen, as it is reversible. Gerty Cori also studied glycogen storage disease, identifying at least four forms, each related to a particular enzymatic defect. She was the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can cause a human genetic disease.

Gerty and Carl Cori collaborated on most of their work, including that which won the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen&quot;. They received one half the prize, the other half going to the Argentinian physiologist, Bernardo Houssay &quot;for his discovery of the part played by the hormone of the anterior pituitary lobe in the metabolism of sugar&quot;. Their work helped clarify the mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolism, advancing understanding of the reversible conversion of sugars and starch, which proved crucial to the development of diabetic treatments.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1947, Gerty Cori became the third woman—and the first American woman—to win a Nobel Prize in science. Previously, Marie Curie had received two, and Irène Joliot-Curie won one. Cori was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. Cori was the fourth woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as board member of the National Science Foundation, a position she held until her death.

Gerty was a member of the American Society of Biological Chemists, the American Chemical Society and the American Philosophical Society. She and her husband were presented jointly with the Midwest Award (American Chemical Society) in 1946 and the Squibb Award in Endocrinology in 1947. In addition, Cori received the Garvan-Olin Medal (1948), the St. Louis Award (1948), the Sugar Research Prize (1950), the Borden Award (1951).

The twenty-five foot square laboratory shared by Cori and her husband at Washington University was deemed a National Historic Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 2004. Six scientists mentored by Cori and her husband went on to win Nobel Prizes, which is only surpassed by the number mentored by British physicist J.J. Thomson.

In 1949, she was awarded the Iota Sigma Pi National Honorary Member for her significant contribution. The crater Cori on the Moon is named after her, as is the Cori crater on Venus. She shares a star with her husband on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1998.
Cori was honored by a US Postal Service stamp in April 2008. The 41-cent stamp was reported by the Associated Press to have a printing error in the chemical formula for glucose-1-phosphate (Cori ester), but was distributed despite the error. Her description reads: &quot;Biochemist Gerty Cori (1896–1957), in collaboration with her husband, Carl, made important discoveries—including a new derivative of glucose—that elucidated the steps of carbohydrate metabolism and contributed to the understanding and treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases. In 1947, the couple was awarded a half share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&quot;

The US Department of Energy named the NERSC-8 supercomputer installed at Berkeley Lab in 2015/2016 after Cori. In November 2016, NERSC&#x27;s Cori ranked 5th on the TOP500 list of world&#x27;s most powerful high-performance computers.

Gerty is the more celebrated of the Coris because she is considered a pioneer woman of science. In her lifetime, however, she experienced much prejudice as a woman.

==Final years==
Just before winning the Nobel prize, while they were on a mountain climbing trip, the Coris learned that Gerty Cori was ill with myelosclerosis, a fatal disease of the bone marrow. During her years at the Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease, Gerty had worked with X-rays, studying their effects on the human body, which may have contributed to her illness. She struggled for ten years with the illness while continuing her scientific work; only in the final months did she let up. In 1957, she died in her home. Gerty was cremated and her ashes scattered. Later, her son erected a cenotaph for Gerty and Carl Cori in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

She was survived by her husband and their only child, Tom Cori, who married the daughter of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly.

Carl Cori remarried in 1960 to Anne Fitzgerald-Jones. The two later moved to Boston, where Carl taught at Harvard Medical School. He continued to work there until his death in 1984, aged 87.

<text>UB40 are an English reggae and pop band, formed in December 1978 in Birmingham, England. The band has had more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart and has also achieved considerable international success. They have been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album four times and were nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group in 1984. UB40 have sold more than 70 million records worldwide. The ethnic make-up of the band&#x27;s original line-up was diverse, with musicians of English, Welsh, Irish, Jamaican, Scottish, and Yemeni parentage.

Their hit singles include their debut track &quot;Food for Thought&quot; and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one hits, &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. Both songs also topped the UK Singles Chart, as did the band&#x27;s version of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, recorded with Chrissie Hynde. The band&#x27;s two most successful albums, &quot;Labour of Love&quot; (1983) and &quot;Promises and Lies&quot; (1993), both reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. UB40 and the English ska band Madness share the record for the most weeks spent by a group in the UK singles chart during the 1980s, with 214 weeks each. 

The band&#x27;s line-up remained stable for nearly 29 years, from March 1979 until January 2008, when frontman Ali Campbell left the band, followed shortly thereafter by keyboardist Mickey Virtue. Another member, Astro, continued with the band until November 2013, when he departed to team up with Campbell and Virtue in a new version of UB40. In 2014, legal advice was sought by the original band (now consisting of remaining co-founding members drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Robin Campbell, bassist Earl Falconer, percussionist Norman Hassan, and saxophonist Brian Travers, along with new vocalist Duncan Campbell), who took action against the group formed by Campbell, Virtue, and Astro over the use of the band name, as both parties were using it. On 5 July 2021, it was announced that Matt Doyle, formerly of the reggae band Kioko, would become the band&#x27;s new vocalist following Duncan Campbell&#x27;s retirement due to ill health.

==History==

===1978–1983: Formation and rise to stardom===
The band members initially formed friendships while attending various schools across Birmingham, England. The name &quot;UB40&quot; was chosen in reference to an attendance card issued to individuals claiming unemployment benefits from the UK government&#x27;s Department of Employment. The designation UB40 stood for Unemployment Benefit, Form 40.

The origins of what would become UB40 can be traced back to mid-1978, when guitarist Ali Campbell, along with drummer Jimmy Brown and bassist Earl Falconer, began rehearsing a mix of popular reggae covers and their own original compositions. They were soon joined by several friends, first percussionists Yomi Babayemi and Norman Hassan, followed by saxophonist Brian Travers and keyboardist Jimmy Lynn. Although Robin Campbell was initially hesitant to commit to forming a band, he eventually joined after being persuaded by his brother Ali. He bought a guitar in December of that year to participate in their jam sessions. 

With Robin&#x27;s inclusion, the eight musicians officially formed a band, choosing the name &quot;UB40&quot; after a friend suggested it as a fitting reference to their shared unemployed status at the time. Before fully committing to the band, Travers had been working as an electrical apprentice for NG Bailey, while Robin Campbell had been an apprentice toolmaker.

This line-up of the band lasted long enough to perform their first show at the Hare &amp; Hounds pub in Kings Heath in February 1979 and one more gig before undergoing their first line-up change. Babayemi and Lynn left the group, with Mickey Virtue joining as keyboardist in place of Lynn. The classic UB40 line-up was completed a month later with the addition of percussionist and vocalist Astro, who had previously worked with Duke Alloy&#x27;s sound system and attended reggae dances across Birmingham. 

Before some of the members had learned to play their instruments properly, Ali Campbell and Brian Travers travelled around Birmingham promoting the band by putting up UB40 posters. The band’s distinctive sound was developed and refined through numerous lengthy jam sessions held at various locations around the city.
Their first gig took place on 9 February 1979 at The Hare &amp; Hounds Pub in Kings Heath, Birmingham, for a friend&#x27;s birthday party. This was commemorated in October 2011 by the unveiling of a plaque at the venue, recognising the band receiving the Performing Rights Society&#x27;s Music Heritage Award. UB40 had their first significant opportunity when Chrissie Hynde saw them perform at a pub and invited them to support her band, The Pretenders. The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;King&quot;/&quot;Food for Thought&quot;, was released on Graduate Records, a local independent label run by David Virr. It reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart.

The title of their first album, &quot;Signing Off&quot;, signifies that the band was signing off from, or ending, their claim for unemployment benefits. It was recorded in a bedsit in Birmingham and produced by Bob Lamb. Norman Hassan remarked of the recording: &quot;If you stripped my track down, you could hear the birds in the background.&quot; This is because his tracks were recorded outside in the garden. &quot;Signing Off&quot; was released on 29 August 1980. It entered the UK Albums Chart on 2 October 1980 and spent a total of 71 weeks on the chart. &quot;Signing Off&quot; is now a Platinum album. As UB40 gained in popularity, they encouraged and supported local musicians and bands from Birmingham, such as Beshara, often bringing them on tour.

Following great success in the UK, UB40&#x27;s popularity in the US was solidified with the release of &quot;Labour of Love&quot;, an album of cover songs, in 1983. The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US five years later. The album featured the song &quot;Red Red Wine&quot;, a cover version of a Neil Diamond song (arranged similarly to Tony Tribe&#x27;s version); it reached number one in the UK in 1983 and number one in the US in 1988. Three years later, UB40 performed at the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986. In 1987, Ray &quot;Pablo&quot; Falconer, the producer of UB40&#x27;s music, died in a car crash. His brother, Earl Falconer, the band&#x27;s bassist, was driving with nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. Earl was sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment in June 1988 and banned from driving for three years.

===1988–2008: Continued success===
On 11 June 1988, UB40 performed at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in London, alongside Dire Straits, George Michael, Whitney Houston, the Bee Gees, and other artists.

Their most successful worldwide single release is their reggae/pop version of &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Help) Falling in Love With You,&quot; which was the main title for the 1993 Sharon Stone movie &quot;Sliver&quot;; it was a number one hit across Europe and in the US. In 1995, they covered the Stevie Wonder song &quot;Superstition&quot; for the Eddie Murphy movie &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, and it appears on their album &quot;The Best of UB40 – Volume Two,&quot; released that year. The group also made a guest appearance in the 1997 feature film &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;. UB40 also featured in the 1988 film &quot;The Yob&quot;. In July 2007, UB40 toured South Africa and headlined the Live Earth concert at the Cradle of Humankind, near Johannesburg.

In 2003, UB40 and the United Colours of Sound recorded &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; as the official anthem for the England national rugby union team. Following England&#x27;s victory in the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup, it reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart.

===2008–present: Line-up changes and the current era===

On 24 January 2008, it was announced that Ali Campbell would be leaving the group after 30 years. Initially, it was stated that Campbell was departing to focus on solo projects, but Campbell later revealed that he was leaving &quot;due to management and business disputes.&quot; The remaining seven members issued a statement, saying: &quot;Ali made a very simple decision; he chose to pursue and prioritise his solo career over continuing to work with UB40 after February 2008. It&#x27;s as simple as that&quot;. Mickey Virtue departed shortly thereafter, citing the same issues as Campbell had as the reasons for his departure.
It was reported by some Birmingham newspapers on 13 March 2008 that Maxi Priest would be the new lead singer of UB40 and had recorded a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; with the band, based on information from an unnamed &quot;source close to the band.&quot; Priest had joined UB40 on their arena tour in 2007, culminating in sell-out shows at the NEC Birmingham in December. Another local newspaper reporting that Maxi Priest would be the new UB40 frontman also included a statement from band spokesman Gerard Franklyn, which contradicted this claim: &quot;Maxi is collaborating with the band to record material, but no decision has been made to replace Ali Campbell with one definitive singer. The reports are half correct; he will be appearing with them for this new recording.&quot; In April 2008, the BBC reported that Campbell was to be replaced in the band by his brother Duncan, with reggae singer Maxi Priest also bolstering the line-up on tour.
The band released their next album, &quot;TwentyFourSeven&quot;, UB40&#x27;s last with their classic line-up, as a free insert in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;″s 4 May 2008 issue. The newspaper sold nearly three million copies. This led to a backlash when the full 17-track version was released on 21 June 2008, and most of the major retailers refused to stock it. It failed to reach the Top 75 in the UK, marking a first, as all their official albums had previously made the Top 50 on the UK Albums Chart. Their next release, on EMI, was a compilation titled &quot;Love Songs&quot;, featuring hits mainly from the &quot;Labour of Love&quot; series, all of which featured Ali Campbell on vocals – it reached number 3 in the UK. The band toured the US, including their first show at the Hollywood Bowl.

In 2009, the band released their first new album with their new lead singer Duncan Campbell, another entry in the &quot;Labour of Love&quot; cover series entitled &quot;Labour of Love IV&quot;. The album charted for only two weeks, reaching number 24. During the 2009 US tour, UB40 offered fans live concert recordings on USB wristbands. The wristbands also included the &quot;Dub Sessions&quot; remix album and photos.
UB40 announced that after completing a coast-to-coast 2010 American tour, they would be playing a nationwide UK tour of theatres in October/November 2010, performing their seminal album &quot;Signing Off&quot; in full, along with a second set of popular UB40 songs. To coincide, on 1 November 2010, a remastered 2CD+DVD of &quot;Signing Off&quot; was released as a &#x27;30th Anniversary Special Edition&#x27;.

In 2011, five founding members of the group and directors of their DEP International label had bankruptcy proceedings initiated against them in relation to debts of the record label. In October 2011, Travers, Wilson, Hassan, and Brown were declared bankrupt. Former member Ali Campbell was also declared bankrupt. In 2013, a new album, &quot;Getting Over the Storm&quot;, was announced, their first since 2010 and &quot;Labour of Love IV&quot;.
In November 2013, UB40 announced dates for their UK tour in early 2014. The announcement followed the success of the band&#x27;s latest Top 30 album, &quot;Getting Over the Storm&quot;, which was awarded BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &#x27;Album of the Week&#x27; accolade and received five-star reviews from the UK&#x27;s music press upon its release in September 2013. On 22 November 2013, Astro announced in a statement that he had left the band, describing it as a &quot;rudderless ship&quot; and criticising the &quot;serious lack of communication between the band and management&quot; as well as the country-oriented direction of their latest album. Astro joined former UB40 members Ali Campbell and Mickey Virtue on stage at the indigO2 Arena in London on 6 December 2013, and on 17 January 2014, the trio announced on their website that they were in the studio recording new music. Ali Campbell was highly critical of his replacement in UB40, stating, &quot;I sat back for five years and watched my brother Duncan murdering my songs.&quot; Ali Campbell toured as UB40 with Astro and Virtue over the summer. The new album, &quot;Silhouette&quot;, featuring the trio, was set for release on 6 October 2014.

In December 2014, Ali Campbell claimed that he would be prepared to go to the High Court in London over the matter rather than settle out of court.

Duncan Campbell retired from UB40 in June 2021 due to ill health, following a stroke he had suffered the previous year; he was replaced the following month by Matt Doyle of fellow Birmingham reggae band Kioko.

On 22 August 2021, saxophonist Brian Travers died of cancer at the age of 62 in his Moseley home. On 6 November of that year, former vocalist and founding member Astro died following a short illness at the age of 64.

In August 2022, the band performed &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; at the Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony, with the show also featuring other acts from Birmingham and the West Midlands region, such as Musical Youth, Panjabi MC, Dexys, Ozzy Osbourne and Apache Indian. They also released the single &quot;Champion&quot; in association with the Commonwealth Games, with this Official Anthem being their first single sung by Matt Doyle. &quot;Champion&quot; also features Dapz on the Map and Gilly G, and can be found on the &quot;On Record&quot; compilation of Birmingham-based bands, alongside &quot;It&#x27;s a Brum Ting&quot; by Friendly Fire Band, the track the BBC used for their Commonwealth Games coverage.

==Influences==
UB40 were influenced by the many blues parties they attended as teenagers in the multicultural Balsall Heath area of Birmingham. They were inspired by artists like Bob Marley and Elvis Presley. Their love of ska, reggae and early lovers rock inspired such original tracks as &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Madam Medusa&quot;, &quot;Food for Thought&quot;, &quot;Signing Off&quot; and &quot;One in Ten&quot;. Their early musical style was unique, with a heavy influence of analogue synthesisers, psychedelic rock guitar, saxophone and dub producer techniques.

The Campbell brothers are the sons of the late folk musician, Ian Campbell. Their father regularly took them to folk festivals and gigs and introduced them to music and to touring. It was at his father&#x27;s folk club &quot;Jug O&#x27; Punch&quot; that Ali Campbell made his singing debut with Dave Swarbrick&#x27;s daughter, Suss, singing &quot;Why Does It Have To Be Me?&quot;.

==Achievements==
UB40 are one of the most commercially successful reggae acts of all time in terms of record sales (over 70 million), chart positions, and touring schedule. Over the course of their career, they have performed sell-out shows worldwide, headlined the Reggae Sunsplash music festival in Jamaica, and introduced reggae to places such as Russia and South America. They have performed twice at the Night of the Proms, in 2000 and 2006. They have been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album four times, and in 1984, they were nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group.

In October 2011, UB40 were honoured with a Heritage Award, a ceremonial plaque from the UK&#x27;s PRS for Music. The plaque was placed at the Hare &amp; Hounds Pub in Birmingham, England, the venue where they played their first gig.

All three of their UK number one hits and four of their five US top ten hits were cover versions. UB40&#x27;s collaborators include: Pato Banton, Madness, Bitty McLean, Chrissie Hynde, Maxi Priest, Robert Palmer, Hunterz, Japanese artist Mikidozan, French artist Nuttea, Lady Saw, Afrika Bambaataa, and 808 State. With 214 weeks spent on the UK singles charts during the 1980s, UB40 and Madness hold the record for the most weeks spent by a group on the UK singles charts during that decade.

Reflecting on the group&#x27;s longevity, Ali Campbell has said that they were fortunate in choosing a relatively young genre, as reggae &quot;... hasn&#x27;t outlived its own cool like jazz has&quot;.

===Timeline===
==Biographies==

===Astro===
Terence Oswald Wilson (24 June 1957 – 6 November 2021), better known by his stage name Astro, was a British musician, rapper, and toaster, who was part of UB40 from 1979 until he left the group in November 2013. His nickname originated from his childhood, as he wore a pair of Dr. Martens boots with the model name &quot;Astronaut&quot;.

Born to Jamaican immigrant parents, he went to school with the future keyboard player of UB40, Virtue. While DJ-ing, he met the Campbell brothers, and bonded so well with them over a shared love of Jamaican music that they invited him to join them as their MC. He believed that reggae music was for everyone, not just for Jamaican Rastafarians.

In the band&#x27;s 1983 version of &quot;Red Red Wine,&quot; he added his own &quot;toasting&quot; lyrics, a Jamaican precursor to rapping. This became an integral part of the group&#x27;s sound. Astro offered the band a more militant edge, rapping about social injustice and racism. He experienced racism himself when he was refused entry to nightclubs because of his dreadlocks, while white members of the band were allowed in.

He eventually quit the band in 2013 after they decided to record a set of country songs. He was not interested in this genre of music and was solely focused on performing and promoting reggae. He went on to join Ali Campbell and Virtue in a rival band to UB40.

Astro died following a short illness on 6 November 2021, at the age of 64.

===Duncan Campbell===

Duncan Campbell (born 3 April 1958 in Birmingham) is an English musician and former lead singer of UB40. He joined the band in 2008 after the departure of his brother Ali Campbell, the former UB40 lead singer. Current bandmate Robin Campbell is also his brother, and he is the son of the late folk singer Ian Campbell. Campbell announced his retirement from live concert performances after suffering a seizure in August 2020. His replacement as lead singer was announced on 5 July 2021 as Matt Doyle, formerly of the band Kioko.

Campbell sang in a harmony group with his brothers as children and performed with their father on stage. He also recorded a reggae album in Jamaica for his brother Ali&#x27;s record label, but it was never released. He was a professional spoon player. &quot;I was the only professional spoon player in the country registered with the Musicians&#x27; Union – until they registered me as a vocalist,&quot; said Campbell. He also worked as a casino manager in Barbados, ran a fish and chip shop in Perth, Australia, and has worked as an actor.

On 24 January 2008, UB40 lead singer Ali Campbell announced that he was leaving the band after a dispute with the management; UB40 announced that they would carry on. On 30 April 2008, UB40 unveiled Duncan as their new lead singer.

Duncan was offered the position of lead singer in 1978, but turned it down at the time, and said that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t get the chance in another 30 years&quot;. Ali Campbell was &quot;disappointed but didn&#x27;t object&quot; to him joining UB40. When asked why he did not join UB40 in 1978, he joked that it was because they were &quot;crap&quot; and that he &quot;was too smart for them and he knew that they would get nowhere&quot;. In 2014, Ali formed a rival version of UB40 with Astro and Mickey Virtue. He said of his brother&#x27;s singing, &quot;I sat back for five years and watched my brother Duncan murdering my songs. We&#x27;re saving the legacy&quot;. Duncan suffered a stroke in August 2020 and announced his retirement from the band in June 2021, citing ill health.

===Earl Falconer===
Earl Acton Falconer (born 23 January 1957 in Meriden, Warwickshire) is a British bass player and singer in UB40. Falconer also co-founded the UK bass label Circus Records alongside Flux Pavilion, Doctor P and DJ Swan-E.

Falconer attended St. Benedict&#x27;s junior school and Mosely Road School of Art. At the time of UB40&#x27;s formation, he was an unemployed plasterer.

===Norman Hassan===
Norman Lamont Hassan (born 26 January 1958) is a British musician of Yemeni and Welsh descent, best known as a member of UB40 since its formation in 1978. Norman Lamont Hassan was born in Birmingham to Yemeni and Welsh parents. He attended Park Hill School and later Queensbridge School in the city. Before joining UB40 in 1978, he worked as a carpet fitter.

Initially starting as a percussionist in 1978, he learned to play the trombone in 1981 when the band decided to add a brass section. He sang his first lead vocal on &quot;Labour of Love&quot;. He is also known for his on-stage dancing. Like the rest of UB40, he still resides in the city of Birmingham. He is a fan of the local football club Birmingham City. His musical tastes are wide-ranging, from reggae to soul to opera.

===Brian Travers===
Brian David Travers was one of the founders of the band. He played the saxophone and was also an arranger and lyricist. He had been suffering from cancer since 2019 and died in August 2021. Travers was a founding member of the socialist Workers Party of Britain in 2019.

==UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro==

In January 2014, Astro, along with former UB40 members Ali Campbell and Mickey Virtue, announced plans to reform and record under the UB40 name. The band released their new song, &quot;Reggae Music,&quot; as a free download in January 2014. In February, with both the original band and the newly formed splinter group set to perform in Dubai under the name UB40 within a few months of each other, the new group announced a name change to &quot;UB40 Reunited&quot;. The splinter group later changed its name again, settling on &quot;UB40 featuring Ali, Astro, and Mickey&quot;, until late 2018, when Virtue departed the band. After this, they continued touring and recording as &quot;UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro&quot;. Astro died on 6 November 2021, after recording tracks for the band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Unprecedented&quot;. The first single from these sessions, &quot;Sufferer&quot;, was released in February 2022, with the album due to be released by UMC on 17 June 2022. Ali Campbell&#x27;s UB40 splinter group also featured the vocalist Matt Hoy until he quit in July 2021.

<doc id="252452" wikidata="Q41613" url="?curid=252452" title="Constans II">
<text>Constans II (; 7 November 630 – 15 July 668), also called &quot;the Bearded&quot; (), was the Byzantine emperor from 641 to 668. Constans was the last attested emperor to serve as consul, in 642, although the office continued to exist until the reign of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912). His religious policy saw him steering a middle line in disputes between the Orthodox and Monothelites by refusing to persecute either and prohibited discussion of the natures of Jesus Christ under the Type of Constans in 648. His reign coincided with Arab invasions under Umar, Uthman, and Mu&#x27;awiya I in the late 640s to 660s. Constans was the first emperor to visit Rome since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, and the last one to visit Rome while the Empire still held it.

==Origins and early career==
Constans was born on 7 November 630 in Constantinople, the Byzantine capital, to Gregoria and Constantine III. Constantine was a son of Emperor Heraclius, while his mother Gregoria was a daughter of Nicetas, a first cousin of Heraclius.

Heraclius died in February 641 and was succeeded by Constantine III and Heraclonas, his younger half-brother through Heraclius&#x27; second marriage to Martina. Constans was most likely elevated to &quot;caesar&quot; by his father to ease his succession to the throne against Martina and her sons. Constantine died suddenly after three months of rule, leaving the 15-year old Heraclonas as senior emperor.

In September 641, the 10-year old Constans II was crowned co-emperor due to rumors that Heraclonas and Martina poisoned Constantine III. Later that same year, on or around 5 November, Heraclonas was deposed by Valentinus, one of Heraclius’ most trusted generals, and Constans II was left as sole emperor. Constans owed his rise to the throne to a popular reaction against his uncle and to the protection of the soldiers led by Valentinus. Although the precocious emperor addressed the senate with a speech blaming Heraclonas and Martina for eliminating his father, he reigned under a regency of senators led by Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople. In 644, Valentinus attempted to seize power for himself, but failed.

==Reign as emperor==

Under Constans, the Byzantines completely withdrew from Egypt in 642, and the third Rashidun caliph Uthman () launched numerous attacks on the islands of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas. A Byzantine fleet under the admiral Manuel occupied Alexandria again in 645, and the Alexandrians hailed him as a liberator, since the caliphate levied heavier taxes and showed less respect for their religion. However, Manuel squandered his time and popularity in plundering the countryside, and eventually the Arab army managed to force him to embark for home. The situation was complicated by the violent opposition to Monothelitism by the clergy in the west and the related rebellion of the Exarch of Carthage, Gregory the Patrician. The latter fell in battle against the army of caliph Uthman, and the region remained a vassal state under the Caliphate until civil war broke out and imperial rule was again restored.

Constans attempted to steer a middle line in the church dispute between Orthodoxy and Monothelitism by refusing to persecute either and prohibiting further discussion of the natures of Jesus Christ by decree in 648 (the Type of Constans). Naturally, this live-and-let-live compromise satisfied few passionate participants in the dispute.

Meanwhile, the advance of the Rashidun Caliphate continued unabated. In 647 they entered Armenia and Cappadocia and sacked Caesarea Mazaca. In the same year, they raided Africa and killed Gregory. In 648, the Arabs raided into Phrygia, and in 649 they launched their first maritime expedition against Crete. A major Arab offensive into Cilicia and Isauria in 650–651 forced the Emperor to enter into negotiations with Caliph Uthman&#x27;s governor of Syria, Mu&#x27;awiya I (), who later reigned as the first Umayyad caliph. The truce that followed allowed a short respite and made it possible for Constans to hold on to the western portions of Armenia.

In 654, however, Mu&#x27;awiya renewed his raids by sea, plundering Rhodes. Constans led a fleet to attack the Muslims at Phoinike (off Lycia) in 655 at the Battle of the Masts, but he was defeated: 500 Byzantine ships were destroyed in the battle, and the Emperor himself was almost killed. The sea battle was so devastating that the emperor escaped only by trading clothes with one of his men. Before the battle, chronicler Theophanes the Confessor says, the Emperor dreamed of being at Thessalonica; this dream predicted his defeat against the Arabs because the word Thessalonika is similar to the sentence &quot;thes allo niken&quot;, which means &quot;gave victory to another (the enemy)&quot;. Caliph Uthman was preparing to attack Constantinople, but he did not carry out the plan, as the first Fitna broke out in 656.

In 658, with the eastern frontier under less pressure, Constans defeated the Slavs in the Balkans, temporarily reasserting some notion of Byzantine rule over them and resettled some of them in Anatolia ( or 667). In 659 he campaigned far to the east, taking advantage of a rebellion against the Caliphate in Media. The same year he concluded peace with the Arabs.

Now Constans could turn to church matters once again. Pope Martin I had condemned both Monothelitism and Constans&#x27; attempt to halt debates over it in the Lateran Council of 649. The Emperor ordered the Exarch of Ravenna to arrest the Pope. Exarch Olympius excused himself from this task, but his successor, Theodore I Calliopas, carried it out in 653. Pope Martin was brought to Constantinople and condemned as a criminal, ultimately being exiled to Cherson, where he died in 655.

Constans grew increasingly fearful that his younger brother, Theodosius, could oust him from the throne; he therefore obliged Theodosius to take holy orders and later had him killed in 660. Constans&#x27; sons Constantine, Heraclius, and Tiberius had been associated on the throne since the 650s. However, having attracted the hatred of the citizens of Constantinople, Constans decided to leave the capital and to move to Syracuse in Sicily.

On his way, he stopped in Macedonia and fought the Slavs at Thessalonica with success. Then, in the winter of 662–663, he made his camp at Athens.

From there, in 663, he continued to Italy. He launched an assault against the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, which then encompassed most of Southern Italy. Taking advantage of the fact that Lombard king Grimoald I of Benevento was engaged against Frankish forces from Neustria, Constans disembarked at Taranto and besieged Lucera and Benevento. However, the latter resisted and Constans withdrew to Naples. During the journey from Benevento to Naples, Constans II was defeated by Mitolas, Count of Capua, near Pugna. Constans ordered Saburrus, the commander of his army, to attack the Lombards again, but he was defeated by the Beneventani at Forino, between Avellino and Salerno.

In 663 Constans visited Rome for twelve days—the first emperor since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and, along with John V Palaiologos, one of only two Eastern Roman emperors since the division of the Roman empire in 395 to set foot in Rome—and was received with great honor by Pope Vitalian (657–672). Although on friendly terms with Vitalian, he stripped buildings (including the Pantheon) of their ornaments and bronze to be carried back to Constantinople, and in 666 declared the Pope to have no jurisdiction over the Archbishop of Ravenna, since that city was the seat of the Exarch, his immediate representative. His subsequent moves in Calabria and Sardinia were marked by further strippings and request of tributes that enraged his Italian subjects.

According to Warren Treadgold, the first &quot;themes&quot; were created between 659 and 661, during the reign of Constans II. However, John Haldon states that this idea is not supported by a &quot;a shred of evidence&quot;, although redistribution of the armies across the Anatolian provinces did take place, and likely resulted in administrative changes.

== Death and succession ==

On 15 July 668, he was assassinated in his bath by his chamberlain, either killed with a bucket or stabbed with a knife. His son Constantine succeeded him as Constantine IV. A brief usurpation in Sicily by Mezezius was quickly suppressed by the new emperor.

== Assessments and legacy ==

The historian Robert Hoyland asserts that Mu&#x27;awiya was a significant Islamic challenge for Constans to &quot;deny [the divinity of] Jesus and turn to the Great God who I worship, the God of our father Abraham&quot; and speculates that Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s tour of Christian sites in Jerusalem was done to demonstrate &quot;the fact that he, and not the Byzantine emperor, was now God&#x27;s representative on earth&quot;.

=== Record in Chinese sources ===

The Chinese dynastic histories of the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; mention several embassies made by &quot;Fu lin&quot; (拂菻), which they equated with Daqin (the Roman Empire). These are recorded as having begun in the year 643 with an embassy sent by the king &quot;Boduoli&quot; (波多力, Constans II Pogonatos) to Emperor Taizong of Tang, bearing gifts such as red glass and green gemstones. Other contacts are reported taking place in 667, 701, and perhaps 719, sometimes through Central Asian intermediaries. These histories also record that the Arabs (&quot;Da shi&quot; 大食) sent their commander &quot;Mo-yi&quot; (Chinese: 摩拽伐之, Pinyin: &quot;Mó zhuāi fá zhī&quot;), to besiege the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and forced the Byzantines to pay them tribute.

This Arab commander &quot;Mo-yi&quot; was identified by historian Friedrich Hirth as Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), the governor of Syria before becoming the Umayyad caliph. The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having massive granite walls and a water clock mounted with a golden statue of man. The Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, writing during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), relayed information about China&#x27;s geography, its capital city &quot;Khubdan&quot; (Old Turkic: &quot;Khumdan&quot;, i.e. Chang&#x27;an), its current ruler &quot;Taisson&quot; whose name meant &quot;Son of God&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Tianzi&quot;), and correctly pointed to its reunification by the Sui dynasty (581–618) as occurring during the reign of Maurice, noting that China had previously been divided politically along the Yangzi River by two warring nations.

==Family==
By his wife Fausta, a daughter of the patrician Valentinus, Constans II had three sons:
* Constantine IV, who succeeded him as Emperor
* Heraclius, co-emperor from 659 to 681
* Tiberius, co-emperor from 659 to 681

<text>Bernardo Alberto Houssay (April 10, 1887 – September 21, 1971) was an Argentine physiologist. Houssay was a co-recipient of the 1947 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for discovering the role played by pituitary hormones in regulating the amount of glucose in animals, sharing the prize with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori. He is the first Latin American Nobel laureate in the sciences.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Bernardo Alberto Houssay was born April 10, 1887, in Buenos Aires. His parents Albert and Clara Houssay were immigrants from France. A precocious youngster, he was admitted to the Pharmacy School at the University of Buenos Aires at 14 years of age and subsequently to the Faculty of Medicine of the same university at 17 years old and was there from 1904 to 1910. While a third-year medical student, Houssay took up a post as a research and teaching assistant in the Chair of Physiology.

=== Career ===
After graduating, he quickly developed and presented his M.D. thesis on the physiological activities of pituitary extracts, published in 1911. This was a theme he would pursue for the rest of his scientific career. Since 1908 he was an assistant lecturer in the same department and immediately after his doctorate, he took up the post of Professor of Physiology in the university&#x27;s School of Veterinary Medicine. Simultaneously, he started a private practice as an assistant physician at the municipal hospital of Buenos Aires. In 1913, he became Chief Physician at the Alvear Hospital, and in 1915, became Chief of the Section of Experimental Pathology at the National Public Health Laboratories in Buenos Aires.

In 1919, Houssay was appointed as the chair of physiology at the University of Buenos Aires Medicine School, serving there until 1943. He transformed and directed the department into a highly respected research department in experimental physiology and medicine of international class. In that year, however, the military dictatorship deprived him of his university posts, due to his liberal political ideas and Houssay was forced to re-establish his research lines and staff at a privately funded Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental. This situation, reinforced by a second dismissal by the Peronist government in 1945, was prolonged until 1955 when Peron was ousted from power and Houssay was reinstated in the University of Buenos Aires, where he remained until he died. From 1957, he was also director of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council.

Houssay worked in many fields of physiology, but his main contribution was experimental investigation of the role of the anterior hypophysis gland in the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly in diabetes mellitus. Houssay demonstrated in the 1930s the diabetogenic effect of anterior hypophysis extracts and the decrease in diabetes severity with anterior hypophysectomy. These discoveries stimulated the study of hormonal feedback control mechanisms which are central to all aspects of modern endocrinology. This work was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947.

Houssay&#x27;s many disciples along his years of activity became also influential themselves as they spread around the world; such as Eduardo Braun-Menéndez, and Miguel Rolando Covian, who went to become the &quot;father&quot; of Brazilian neurophysiology, as chairman of the Department of Physiology of the Medical Faculty of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo. Houssay wrote with them the most influential textbook of Human Physiology in Latin America, in Spanish and Portuguese, which, since 1950 has been published in successive editions and used in almost all medical schools of the continent. Houssay published more than 600 scientific papers and several specialized books. Besides the Nobel, Houssay won many distinctions and awards from the Universities of Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, Paris, and 15 other universities, as well as the Dale Medal of the Society for Endocrinology in 1960.

Houssay was also very active as a scientific leader and promoter of the advancement of scientific research and medical education, in Argentina as well as in Latin America. Houssay was elected a Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1940, an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1941, a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1943, and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1944.

=== Legacy ===

* In 1996, the Prefectura Naval Argentina acquired a ketch-rigged research vessel from CONICET, renaming her &quot;Dr. Bernardo Houssay&quot; (MOV 1).

* Houssay&#x27;s pioneering research on the endocrine hormones system, or &quot;hormone feedback loops&quot;, was the basis for the cortisol injection treatment for US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s often-fatal adrenal insufficiency, diagnosed in 1947.

<text>The National Anthem of the Republic of Costa Rica (), also known by its incipit as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Noble Fatherland, Your Beautiful Flag&quot;), was first adopted in 1852. Its music was composed by Manuel María Gutiérrez Flores, who dedicated the score to French adventurer . The music was created to receive delegates from the United Kingdom and the United States that year for the Webster-Crampton Treaty. It was the first Central American national anthem.

The anthem has had several lyrics; the current lyrics were written for a contest held in 1903 by the government of Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra to give the anthem lyrics that reflected the idea of being Costa Rican. The contest was won by José María Zeledón Brenes.

The anthem&#x27;s lyrics were made official in 1949 by the Founding Junta of the Second Republic, led by José Figueres Ferrer. The music was made official in 1979, under President Rodrigo Carazo Odio.

== History ==
From the period of independence within the First Mexican Empire from 1821 to the beginning of the First Costa Rican Republic in 1848, Costa Rica did not have a national anthem. After the establishment of the republic, Costa Rica began to gain more recognition from other nations. In 1852, then president, Juan Rafael Mora Porras, learnt of the arrival of diplomatic representatives from the United Kingdom and United States in order to establish embassies.

Musician and Director of the Costa Rican Military Band, , then 22 years old, was asked to compose an anthem. Professing a lack of experience and little time, Gutiérrez asked for help from French adventurer , who instructed and encouraged him. After consulting Lafond, Gutiérrez composed the anthem in three or four days in his home in central San José. An apocryphal story circulates that Gutiérrez had to compose the music for the anthem while locked in a prison cell for refusing the order the president gave him to compose the anthem, and that he composed the anthem in 24 hours.

The anthem was played in public for the first time by the (San José Band) at the welcome receptions for the delegations from the United Kingdom and United States on 11 June 1852 at the (Government House). The event was held in the Main Barracks, where the Raventós Theatre was later situated, today the Melico Salazar Theatre.

The anthem was largely forgotten after this, so much so that lyrics for it were not made official until 1949, after the civil war and the founding of the Second Republic, and the music was not made official until 1 September 1979, with decree 10471-E, during the presidency of Rodrigo Carazo Odio. The decree was intended to coincide with Gutiérrez&#x27;s birthday (which is now known to be 3 September).

== Lyrics ==
There was no intention to add lyrics at the time of the anthem&#x27;s creation, as it was urgently needed for the welcome ceremonies for the foreign delegations. Some lyrics had been written in 1856 during the Filibuster War, to encourage troops on the battlefield, but they were quickly forgotten.

=== 1873 lyrics ===
The first lyrics of the national anthem were written by a Colombian poet living in Costa Rica, José Manuel Lleras, and premiered in 1873. In the context of looming threats by other states to overthrow then president Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez, as well as a threat of the instrumental anthem becoming forgotten by non–military band members, Lleras wrote long lyrics that included high praise of President Guardia, intended to encourage Costa Ricans in the event of war:

Lleras&#x27;s lyrics were forgotten after the events regarding President Guardia.

=== 1879 lyrics ===
In 1879, the anthem began to be sung with shorter lyrics written by seminarian Juan Garita y Guillén, which premiered on 24 June that year at the (Seminary College). Garita&#x27;s lyrics were very simplistic:

Like Lleras&#x27;s lyrics, Garita&#x27;s lyrics also stopped being sung. The Lleras and Garita lyrics were never officially adopted.

=== 1888 lyrics ===
In 1888, Spanish pedagogue Juan Fernández Ferraz wrote a poetic third set of lyrics for the national anthem, which were longer than the previous lyrics. After being distributed in schools and colleges, they were sung for longer and were made official:

=== Current lyrics ===
Although Fernández Ferraz&#x27;s composition had literary merit, its language was somewhat too elevated to take root in the people, in addition to not adapting well to the music of the anthem, and adjustments had to be made to the original score by maestro Gutiérrez. All of this led to a decision to replace Fernández Ferraz&#x27;s lyrics with new lyrics, for which a public contest was held in 1903. The contest was won by a composition by José María Zeledón Brenes, presented under the pseudonym . Zeledón Brenes was declared the winner on 24 August, and his lyrics were first sung publicly on 15 September.

Zeledón Brenes&#x27;s lyrics, with minor changes, are the current lyrics of the national anthem of Costa Rica. They were officially adopted on 10 June 1949 by the Founding Junta of the Second Republic with decree number 551:


In Zeledón&#x27;s original wording, the first stanza read:

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, adopted under law number 60–207 on 27 July 1960. It takes the form of a lyric and very patriotic poem, invoking inspiring imagery expressing the greatness of the Ivorian soil and values such as hope, peace, dignity, and the &quot;true brotherhood&quot;.

== History ==
Adopted in 1960 at the country&#x27;s independence, &quot;&quot; remains the national anthem of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, though the &quot;de jure&quot; capital is now Yamoussoukro, while Abidjan remains the economic capital and retains some political functions. This hymn is strongly tinged with patriotism and influenced by religion. The lyrics are from ministers Mathieu Vangah Ekra and Joachim Bony. The music was composed by abbots Pierre-Marie Coty and Pierre-Michel Pango, taking &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as a model.

Between 2007 and 2009, under the leadership of Laurent Gbagbo, there was a proposal to replace &quot; with a different song, &quot; as the national anthem. This Ode was composed in 2002 after the start of the Ivorian civil war, and was selected by contest in 2003. &quot; was sung by supporters of the now former head of state and broadcast on the RTI&#x27;s television network instead of &quot; until 2007, even though the latter remained, according to the constitution, the country&#x27;s national anthem. However, the proposal was eventually dropped.

<text>Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays (Academic Press, 1982) by Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy is a compendium of information on mathematical games. It was first published in 1982 in two volumes.

The first volume introduces combinatorial game theory and its foundation in the surreal numbers; partizan and impartial games; Sprague–Grundy theory and misère games. The second volume applies the theorems of the first volume to many games, including nim, sprouts, dots and boxes, Sylver coinage, philosopher&#x27;s phutball, fox and geese. A final section on puzzles analyzes the Soma cube, Rubik&#x27;s Cube, peg solitaire, and Conway&#x27;s Game of Life.

A republication of the work by A K Peters split the content into four volumes.

<doc id="252467" wikidata="Q237591" url="?curid=252467" title="La Bayamesa">
<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; ( ), officially known by its full title as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;The Bayamo Anthem&#x27;), is the national anthem of Cuba. It was first performed in 1868, during the Battle of Bayamo. Perucho Figueredo, who took part in the battle, wrote the lyrics to the anthem, and he, along with Antonio Rodriguez-Ferrer, composed the melody of &quot;La Bayamesa&quot; in 1868.

==Overview==
On October 20, 1868, the Cuban forces obtained the capitulation of the Spanish colonial authorities in Bayamo, the jubilant people surrounded Figueredo and asked him to write an anthem with the melody they were humming. Right on the saddle of his horse, Figueredo wrote the lyrics of the anthem, which was longer than the current official version. Figueredo was captured and executed by the Spanish two years later. Just before the firing squad received the Fire command, Figueredo shouted the line from his song: &quot;Morir por la Patria es vivir&quot; ().

Officially adopted by Cuba as its national anthem in 1902, upon the foundation of the Republic, it was retained even after the revolution of 1959. The Cuban composer Antonio Rodriguez-Ferrer contributed the musical introductory notes to the Cuban national anthem.

In addition to the &quot;Himno de Bayamo&quot;, there are two other well-known Cuban songs called &quot;&quot;. The first Bayamesa was composed in 1851 by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes and José Fornaris at the request of their friend Francisco Castillo Moreno, who is sometimes also credited with the lyrics. After 1868, during the Cuban war, a &quot;mambí&quot; version of &quot;&quot; became popular. It has the same melody but different lyrics. Many years later, in 1918, the composer and trovador Sindo Garay, from Santiago de Cuba, composed a song that he called &quot;Mujer Bayamesa&quot;; popular usage shortened the title to &quot;&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Originally, the song had three verses. The last two were excluded when the anthem was officially adopted in 1902, because the lyrics were seen to be excessively anti-Spanish and too long compared with the other verses.

<text>Edward Calvin Kendall (March 8, 1886 – May 4, 1972) was an American biochemist. In 1950, Kendall was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine along with Swiss chemist Tadeusz Reichstein and Mayo Clinic physician Philip S. Hench, for their work with the hormones of the adrenal glands. Kendall not only researched the adrenal glands, he also isolated thyroxine, a hormone of the thyroid gland and worked with the team that crystallized glutathione and identified its chemical structure.

Kendall was a biochemist at the Graduate School of the Mayo Foundation at the time of the Nobel award. He received his education at Columbia University. After retiring from his job with the Mayo Foundation, Kendall joined the faculty at Princeton University, where he remained until his death in 1972. Kendall Elementary School, in Norwalk is named for him.

==Early life and education==
Kendall was born in South Norwalk, Connecticut in 1886. He attended Columbia University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1908, a Master of Science degree in Chemistry in 1909, and a Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1910.

==Research career==
After obtaining his Ph.D., his first job was in research for Parke, Davis and Company, and his first task was to isolate the hormone associated with the thyroid gland. He continued this research at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in New York until 1914. He was appointed Head of the Biochemistry Section in the Graduate School of the Mayo Foundation, and the following year he was appointed as the Director of the Division of Biochemistry.

Kendall made several significant contributions to biochemistry and medicine. His most important discovery was the isolation of thyroxine, although it was not the work for which he received the most accolades. Along with associates, Kendall was involved with the isolation of glutathione and determining its structure. He also isolated several steroids from the adrenal gland cortex, one of which was initially called Compound E. Working with Mayo Clinic physician Philip Showalter Hench, Compound E was used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The compound was eventually named cortisone. In 1950, Kendall and Hench, along with Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein were awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &quot;their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects.&quot; His Nobel lecture focused on the basic research that led to his award, and was titled &quot;The Development of Cortisone As a Therapeutic Agent.&quot; As of the 2010 awards, Kendall and Hench were the only Nobel Laureates to be affiliated with Mayo Clinic.

Kendall was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1950, and both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1951.

Kendall&#x27;s career at Mayo ended in 1951, when he reached mandatory retirement age. He moved on to Princeton University, where he was a visiting professor in the Department of Biochemistry. He remained affiliated with Princeton until his death in 1972. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Kendall received other major awards including the Lasker Award, the Passano Foundation Award and the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. Kendall received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Cincinnati, Western Reserve University, Williams College, Yale University, Columbia University, National University of Ireland, and Gustavus Adolphus College.

==Family life==
Kendall married Rebecca Kennedy in 1915, and they had four children. He died in 1972 in Princeton, New Jersey. His wife died in 1973.

<text>Philip Showalter Hench (February 28, 1896 – March 30, 1965) was an American physician. Hench, along with his Mayo Clinic co-worker Edward Calvin Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for the discovery of the hormone cortisone, and its application for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The Nobel Committee bestowed the award for the trio&#x27;s &quot;discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects.&quot;

Hench received his undergraduate education at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, and received his medical training at the United States Army Medical Corps and the University of Pittsburgh. He began working at Mayo Clinic in 1923, later serving as the head of the Department of Rheumatology. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hench received many other awards and honors throughout his career. He also had a lifelong interest in the history and discovery of yellow fever.

==Early life==
He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1916. After serving in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and the reserve corps to finish his medical training, he was awarded a doctorate in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. Immediately after finishing his medical degree, Hench spent a year as an intern at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh, and then he subsequently became a Fellow of the Mayo Foundation.

In 1928 and 1929, Hench furthered his education at Freiburg University and the von Müller Clinic in Munich.

==Medical career==
Hench started his career at Mayo Clinic in 1923, working in the Department of Rheumatic Diseases. In 1926, he became the head of the department. While at Mayo Clinic, Hench focused his work on arthritic diseases, where his observations led him to hypothesize that steroids alleviated pain associated with the disease. During this same time, biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall has isolated several steroids from the adrenal gland cortex. After several years of work, the duo decided to try one of these steroids (dubbed Compound E at the time, later to become known as cortisone) on patients afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during World War II. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949.
Hench, Kendall, and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein were awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects.&quot; As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel laureates affiliated with Mayo Clinic. Hench&#x27;s Nobel Lecture was directly related to the research he was honored for, and titled &quot;The Reversibility of Certain Rheumatic and Non-Rheumatic Conditions by the Use of Cortisone Or of the Pituitary Adrenocorticotropic Hormone&quot;. His speech at the banquet during the award ceremony acknowledged the connections between the study of medicine and chemistry, saying of his co-winners &quot;Perhaps the ratio of one physician to two chemists is symbolic, since medicine is so firmly linked to chemistry by a double bond.&quot;

During his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association, and served as its president in 1940 and 1941. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hench has been awarded the Heberdeen Medal (1942), the Lasker Award (1949), the Passano Foundation Award (1950), and the Criss Award. Lafayette College, Washington and Jefferson College, Western Reserve University, the National University of Ireland and the University of Pittsburgh awarded Hench honorary doctorates.

In addition to his work with cortisone, Hench had a career long interest in yellow fever. Starting in 1937, Hench began to document the history behind the discovery of yellow fever. His collection of documents on this subject are at the University of Virginia in the Philip S. Hench Walter Reed Yellow Fever Collection. His wife donated the collection to the university after his death.

==Family==
Hench married Mary Kahler (1905–1982) in 1927. His father-in-law, John Henry Kahler, was a friend of Mayo Clinic founder William J. Mayo. Hench and his wife had four children, two daughters and two sons. His son, Philip Kahler Hench also studied rheumatology. Hench died of pneumonia while on vacation in Ocho Rios, Jamaica in 1965.

<doc id="252487" wikidata="Q41605" url="?curid=252487" title="Constantine IV">
<text>Constantine IV (; ; 650 – 10 July 685), called the Younger () and often incorrectly the Bearded () out of confusion with his father, was Byzantine emperor from 668 to 685. His reign saw the first serious check to nearly 50 years of uninterrupted Arab expansion, most notably his successful defence of Constantinople, and the temporary stabilization of the Byzantine Empire after decades of war, defeats, and civil strife. His calling of the Sixth Ecumenical Council saw the end of the monothelitism controversy in the Byzantine Empire; for this, he is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on September 3.

==Early career==
The eldest son of Constans II and Fausta, daughter of patrician Valentinus, Constantine IV had been named a co-emperor with his father in 654, almost certainly in Easter (13 April). His year of birth is unknown, but often given as 650. He became emperor in September 668, when news arrived at Constantinople that Constans II had been assassinated in Sicily.

The first task before the new Emperor was the suppression of the military revolt in Sicily under Mezezius which had led to his father&#x27;s death. Within seven months of his accession, Constantine IV had dealt with the insurgency with the support of Pope Vitalian, but this success was overshadowed by troubles in the east.

As early as 668 the Caliph Muawiyah I received an invitation from Saborios, the commander of the troops in Armenia, to help overthrow the Emperor at Constantinople. He sent an army under his son Yazid against the Byzantine Empire. Yazid reached Chalcedon and took the important Byzantine center Amorion. While the city was quickly recovered, the Arabs next attacked Carthage and Sicily in 669. In 670 the Arabs captured Cyzicus and set up a base from which to launch further attacks into the heart of the Empire. Their fleet captured Smyrna and other coastal cities in 672. Also, in 672, the Arabs sent a large fleet to attack Constantinople by sea. While Constantine was distracted by this, the Slavs laid siege to Thessalonica.

==The First Arab Siege of Constantinople (667–9)==


It has been entrenched in modern historiography that the first Arab siege of Constantinople took place at the fictitious date around the years 674 and 678. However, this is far from the factual reality, and has been identified as errors after Theophanes&#x27; attempt to assign to specific years the information he had gathered from his oriental sources. In the light of a thorough and critical analysis of various Arab, Syriac and lesser known Byzantine historical sources has reconstructed the course of the events. As it is well known during the reign of his father Constans II the capital of the Byzantine empire had been transferred by 663 to Suracuse. The ensuing relocation of the imperial court meant that large portions of the armed imperial forces alongside its navy which was the medium that realised this vast logistical enterprise moved and stationed to Sicily altogether. If anything the emperor Constans II with this move left the Byzantine capital relatively exposed to the imminent danger of the Arabs, despite the fact that both the empress Fausta and his three sons and co-emperors, Constantine IV, Heraclius, and Tiberius had remained there. The Arab forays in Anatolia had started already by c. 662/3 in the frontier zone of Melitene shortly after Muʿāwiya had emerged victorious from the internal civil strife in the Caliphate. One of those raids led by Busr b. Abī Artāt reportedly reached Constantinople plundering its immediate vicinity. The weakened Byzantine armies in the meantime were unable to check the Arab incursions. The situation was propitious for the Byzantine patrician and general of the theme of Armeniakon, Saborios to revolt against the imperial government after having secured the backing of the Arabs. Muʿāwiya I saw in Saborios an unexpected ally and an opportune chance to invade further inland, taking advantage of the Byzantine armies&#x27; distress. Although the concerted plan never materialised as such due to the accidental death of Saborios, this did not hamper Muʿāwiya from advancing his plan to bring the Byzantine empire to heel. He launched the offensive in 667 with numerous forces that marched to Constantinople, while another number of his forces was sailing with the fleet to Constantinople. The command of the Arab armies marching to Constantinople had been entrusted by Muʿāwiya to his general and qādī of Damascus, Fadālah b. ῾Ubayd al-Ansarī.

The army invaded the Byzantine territories by summer of 667 and through a number of raids and plundering arrived by the end of 667 at Chalkedon where it spent the winter. Meanwhile, the Arab navy consisting of Egyptian and Syrian fleet units under the command of Muʿāwiya son, Yazīd b. Muʿāwiya was also sailing towards Constantinople which it reached by autumn 667. Among the comrades of Yazīd where four Companions of the Prophet and members of the Medinan aristocracy, to wit ʿAbdallāh b. ʿAbbās paternal cousin of the Prophet and ancestor of the Abbasids, ʿAbdallāh b. ʿUmar the son of the second caliph and one of the most important transmitters of the hadith, ʿAbdallāh b. al-Zubayr, son a sister of the Prophet&#x27;s wife ʿAʾisha, grandson of Abū Bakr and future caliph during the civil war of 680-692, and Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī who hosted the Prophet during his stay in Medīna according to the Arab historiographer al-Tabarī. The two contingents united after reaching the walls of Constantinople blockaded the capital, although no assault of importance took place until the end of winter of 667 but instead only plundering of the countryside. By spring of 668 the Arab forces strained their blockade and the capital was under siege for the whole of spring up to middle of June 668. However, the numerous Arab armies having wintered at camps were malnourished and soon they were suffering severe famine, whereas the outbreak of a smallpox epidemic decimated them in large numbers forcing Yasīd to lift the siege hurriedly. Nevertheless, the army and navy remained in Cyzicus from where they engaged in small scale battles and raids in the vicinity of Constantinople and its immediate countryside before they set sail back to Syria around 669/70.

==Rise of Constantine IV to power, Mezezios the usurper, and the monetary reform of 668 ==
The first Arab siege of Constantinople set in motion a number of developments. In the aftermath of the siege the victorious, albeit during the circumstances mostly rather than his prowess, Constantine emerged as leader of the city. The news of the lifting of the siege had not yet reached Suracuse due to the naval blockade of Constantinople and the fear for the worst possible scenario led a party of the emperor&#x27;s closest high-ranking military office holders to unfold a plot to remove him out of, supposedly, concern for the continuation of the empire. Be that as it may, the assassination of the emperor Constans II took place on the 15th of July of 668. Upon the emperor&#x27;s death that fraction of conspirators proclaimed Mezezios as emperor in Sicily. However, the rebel did not enjoy of pope Vitalian&#x27;s acceptance and only one part of the army lent to him support, whereas the Byzantine navy under the command of the loyal dignitary named Severus returned to Constantinople. The arrival of the navy in Constantinople by late 668 was a salutary point for it offered to Constantine IV until then bereft of any substantial army and some ten ship to his disposal, to confront pari passu with the Arab navy which apparently desisted from besieging again Constantinople. Constantine IV with the control of the navy at his hands and Constantinople freed of the danger sent his two brothers and co-emperors to the West with a number of armies in a division of the front of the war between the three brothers. Meanwhile and from another warfront the Egyptian governor Maslama b. Mukhallad sent his fleet under the command of Muʿāwiyah b. Ḥudayj al-Kindī to attack Sicily in order to undermine the efforts of Constans II to reorganise the empire&#x27;s position in the West. In doing so he launched some cursory incursions to the island, but in the meantime Mezezios had solicited the help of Constantine IV and in doing so he precipitated his own demise. Upon arrival of the fleet comprising some 600 ships the Arabs avoided going in naval battle and retreated. Constantine IV upon landing on Suracuse had Mezezios arrested and decapitated while the rest of his supporters were arrested and sent back to Constantinople chained.

In the wake of the Arab siege and his father&#x27;s relocation to Suracuse where presumably the imperial treasury was also moved and possibly plundered after Constans II assassination, Constantine IV was faced with a surging economic crisis. The Arab raids of Asia Minor and the territorial losses in broader Syria meant also the loss of some important mines and shortage of precious metals for the higher value coinage. Other from devaluating the higher order issues the new emperor opted for reissuing the copper follis of Justinian which meant, the iconographic return aside, four times heavier coin. This increase in the metal&#x27;s substance increased the monetary value of his copper follis and probably made redundant the solidi of Mezezios in order to strike his opponent by destabilising his currency&#x27;s value. However, Constantine IV by the next year when his son&#x27;s was born decided to undo his father&#x27;s ecclesiastical policy and not only named his son Justinian II, but he furthered the restructuring of the rest of the monetary system to Justinian&#x27;s issues in terms design and layout. The fostering of such a propaganda where he was likened himself to Justinian aimed at glossing his reign with a profound renovatio imperii which he essentially did as the Byzantines from 672 to 680 had gained the offensive and through a series of counterattacks to Egypt and to Syria attained to paralyse the Arab danger. This put an end to 15 years of successive raids and devastation and Muʿāwiya&#x27;s death on 6 May of 680 sealed that end for good.

==Later reign==

With the temporary passing of the Arab threat, Constantine turned his attention to the Church, which was torn between Monothelitism and Orthodoxy. In November 680 Constantine convened the Sixth Ecumenical Council (also known as the Third Council of Constantinople). Constantine presided in person during the formal aspects of the proceedings (the first eleven sittings and then the eighteenth), surrounded by his court officials, but he took no active role in the theological discussions. The Council reaffirmed the Orthodox doctrines of the Council of Chalcedon in 451. This solved the controversy over monothelitism; conveniently for the Empire, most monothelites were now under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate. The council closed in September 681.

Due to the ongoing conflicts with the Arabs during the 670s, Constantine had been forced to conclude treaties in the west with the Lombards, who had captured Brindisi and Taranto. Also in 680, the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh crossed the Danube into nominally Imperial territory and began to subjugate the local communities and Slavic tribes. In 680, Constantine IV led a combined land and sea operation against the invaders and besieged their fortified camp in Dobruja. Suffering from bad health, the Emperor had to leave the army, which panicked and was defeated by the Bulgars. In 681, Constantine was forced to acknowledge the Bulgar state in Moesia and to pay tribute/protection money to avoid further inroads into Byzantine Thrace. Consequently, Constantine created the Theme of Thrace.

His brothers Heraclius and Tiberius had been crowned with him as &quot;augusti&quot; during the reign of their father, and this was confirmed by the demand of the populace, but in late 681 Constantine had them mutilated by slitting their noses so they would be considered ineligible to rule. Some argue that he then associated Justinian II to the throne, but all contemporary evidence indicates that he became emperor only after Constantine&#x27;s death on 10 July 685.

==Family==
By his wife Anastasia, Constantine IV had at least two sons:
* Justinian II in 669, who succeeded him as emperor at the age of sixteen.
* Heraclius 670, known only from an episode in which his father sent locks of his and his brother&#x27;s hair to Pope Benedict II.

==In art and popular culture==
* Constantine IV was portrayed by Iossif Surchadzhiev in the 1981 Bulgarian movie &quot;Aszparuh&quot;, directed by Ludmil Staikov.
* Constantine IV is the subject of the song &quot;Imperator&quot; (&quot;Emperor&quot;), released by the Bulgarian heavy metal band Epizod in their 2012 album &quot;Moyata molitva&quot; (&quot;My prayer&quot;).

<text>Fairtrade International, or Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International E.V. is a nonprofit product-oriented multistakeholder group aimed at promoting the lives of farmers and workers through fair trade. Fairtrade&#x27;s work is guided by a global strategy focused on ensuring that all farmers earn a living income, and agricultural workers earn a living wage. Fairtrade works with farmers and workers of more than 300 commodities. The main products promoted under the Fairtrade label are coffee, cocoa, banana, flowers, tea, and sugar.

Fairtrade is an association of three Producer Networks, nineteen National Fairtrade Organisations (formerly: Fairtrade Labelling Organisations) and eight Fairtrade Marketing Organisations that promote and market the Fairtrade Certification Mark in their countries 

Producer Networks exist in Latin America, The Caribbeans, Africa, Middle East, Asia and the Pacific. National Fairtrade Organisations exist in 16 European countries as well as in Canada, the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Fairtrade International also oversees Fairtrade Marketing Organisations in the Czech Republic, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Philippines, and Poland.

==History==
Fairtrade International was established in 1997. It set private standards relating to labour, cooperative organisation, and the governance of the Fairtrade benefits. The organisation was divided in January 2004 into two independent organisations:

* Fairtrade International develops and reviews Fairtrade standards and assists producers in gaining and maintaining certification and in capitalizing on market opportunities on the Fairtrade market. The standards are developed and reviewed by the Fairtrade Standards and Policy Committee, in which Fairtrade members, producer organizations, traders and external experts participate.
* FLOCERT ensures that producers and traders comply with the FLO Fairtrade Standards and that producers invest the benefits received through Fairtrade in their development. Operating independently from any other interests, it follows the international ISO standards for certification bodies (ISO 65).

== Membership ==

The following are National Fairtrade Organizations and Fairtrade Marketing Organizations:

* Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand
* Fairtrade Österreich
* Fairtrade Belgium
* Fairtrade Canada
* Fairtrade Česko a Slovensko (Marketing Organization)
* Fairtrade Mærket Danmark
* Fairtrade Finland (incl. Baltic states)
* Fairtrade Max Havelaar France
* Fairtrade Deutschland
* Fairtrade Hong Kong (Marketing Organization)
* Fairtrade India (Marketing Organization)
* Fairtrade Ireland
* Fairtrade Italia
* Fairtrade Japan
* Fairtrade Korea (Marketing Organization)
* Fairtrade Lëtzebuerg
* Fairtrade Nederland (Max Havelaar)
* Fairtrade Norge
* Fairtrade Polska (Marketing Organization)
* Fairtrade Ibérica
* Fairtrade Sverige
* Fairtrade Max Havelaar
* Fairtrade Taiwan (Marketing Organization)
* The Fairtrade Foundation (United Kingdom)
* Fairtrade America

These initiatives were joined in 2007 by three Producer Networks:

* Network of Asian and Pacific Producers (NAPP)
* Coordinadora Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Pequeños Productores de Comercio Justo (CLAC)
* Fairtrade Africa

== Structure ==

Fairtrade International is divided into six units:

* Standards and Pricing—sets and maintains fair trade standards
* Finance, Operations and Central Services—ensures coordinated communications, finance, human resources, fundraising, and IT services
* Global Products, Programs, and Policies. Implements all the commodity facing work, as well as programs on living income, living wages, and climate change
*Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning- Data governance and management, research and impact.
*External Relations - In charge of resource mobilization, communications and advocacy
*Brand, Trademark, and Licensing. Promotes the integrity of the Fairtrade Mark and relationships with licensees.

The coordination of all global activities is led by a Global Leadership Team, made of the CEO, the COO, and the CVO (Chief Value Officer).

== Fairtrade standards ==
Given the development focus of fair trade, related standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organisations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time.

There are two types of fairtrade standards for disadvantaged producers: standards for small farmers&#x27; organizations and for hired labor situations.

* Small farmers&#x27; organization standards include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the fair trade premiums are invested, etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.
* Hired labour situation standards seek to ensure that employees receive decent wages and may join unions and bargain collectively. Fairtrade certified plantations must also ensure that there is no forced or child labour and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labor situation, fair trade standards require a &quot;joint body&quot; to be set up with representatives from both management and employees. This joint body decides on how fairtrade premiums will be spent to benefit plantation employees.

For some products, such as coffee, only fair trade standards for small farmers&#x27; organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers&#x27; organizations and plantations can be certified.

Fair trade standards and procedures are approved by the FLO Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers, and traders) and external experts. Fair trade standards are set in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standards setting and are in addition the result of an extensive consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.

In 2020, Fairtrade issued a position statement defending their use of private standards in response to a report from The Institute for Multi-Stakeholder Initiative Integrity (MSI Integrity).

==Hazardous materials==
A list of hazardous materials whose use in production of Fairtrade products is prohibited or restricted is maintained by Fairtrade International, divided into sections known as the &quot;Red List&quot;, &quot;Orange List&quot; and &quot;Yellow List&quot; respectively. The Red List covers materials which are prohibited and may not be used in Fairtrade products. The Orange List details materials which may only be used in specified conditions; some of these were to be disallowed from June 2020 or June 2022. The Yellow List covers materials which are flagged as hazardous and only to be used with caution. The organisation relied on international conventions including the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2014) in formulating its list. Earlier versions of the list distinguished between &quot;red&quot; (prohibited) and &quot;amber&quot; (under consideration for prohibition) elements.

== Child labour ==
Fairtrade prohibits child labour and anyone under 15 years old cannot be employed by Fairtrade organisation. Children under 18 years old can be employed, but their employment cannot interfere with their education or development. Children are only allowed to work on family farms under strict conditions, the work must be age appropriate and outside of school hours or on holidays.

Fairtrade faced backlash as child labour was found on one of its cocoa plantations.

== International Fairtrade Certification Mark ==
The Fairtrade Mark is an international independent consumer Mark which appears on products as a guarantee that producers and traders have met fair trade standards. The Fairtrade Mark is owned and protected by Fairtrade International, on behalf of its 25-member and associate member labeling initiatives and producer networks.

For a product to carry the Fairtrade Mark, it must come from FLOCERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade Standards set by Fairtrade International. The supply chain is also monitored by FLOCERT to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only authorized licensees can use the Fairtrade Mark on their products.

<text>Guido Cantelli (; 27 April 192024 November 1956) was an Italian orchestral conductor. Toscanini elected him his &quot;spiritual heir&quot; since the beginnings of his career. He was named Music Director of La Scala, Milan in November 1956, but his promising career was cut short only one week later by his death at the age of 36 in the 1956 Paris DC-6 crash in France en route to the United States.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Cantelli was born on 27 April 1920 in Novara, Italy, to Antonio and Angela (née Riccardone). He started studying music while still very young. From 1939 until 1941 he studied with Arrigo Pedrollo, and then, from 1941 until 1942, with Giorgio Federico Ghedini and Antonino Votto. In 1940 he started his conducting career, graduating from the Milan Conservatory in 1943.

===Career===
Cantelli studied at the Milan Conservatory and began a promising conducting career. In 1943, he garnered acclaim for a representation of the &quot;Traviata&quot; at the Teatro Coccia. Besides being the conductor, Cantelli was also the artistic director of the representation.

Cantelli&#x27;s career was interrupted by World War II, during which he was forced to serve in the Italian army, and then placed in a German labour camp because of his outspoken opposition to the Nazis. He was sent with a team of labourers to Frankfurt am Main. While in Germany, Cantelli was interned in a concentration camp in Szczecin. He fell ill and managed to escape the camp. Cantelli was repatriated to Italy in 1944, establishing himself in Turin. He resumed his musical career after the Allies liberated Italy.

After resuming his musical career in Turin, Cantelli was invited to conduct some concerts with the Symphony Orchestra of the Radio of Milan (&quot;Orchestra sinfonica della Radio di Milano&quot;). Riccardo Pick-Mangiagalli, the director of the Milan Conservatory, decided it was the moment to present the young conductor to the wide public, organizing a concert at the Rocchetta Court of the Castello Sforzesco on 27 July 1945, entrusting to Cantelli the Orchestra of La Scala. The programme was very proving, and included, among other things, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, or &quot;Pathétique Symphony&quot;. The performance immediately signalled Cantelli&#x27;s &quot;innate elegance of the gesture, the interpretative strength and stylistic purity, which, animated by the youthful momentum of the young conductor, made a great impression on the public.&quot;
After the success of the Castello Sforzesco concert, a successful international career started for Cantelli. This career would bring him to the major stages of the world, where he would conduct the world&#x27;s most famous orchestras. He was acclaimed by the public and the critics alike. However, in spite of all the compliments and the success, Cantelli&#x27;s attention was not diverted from his studies. He kept on studying with &quot;scrupulous commitment and professionalism,&quot; encouraged by the great Arturo Toscanini. Toscanini saw him conduct at La Scala, Milan, and remained impressed. The results of these stylistic studies by Cantelli maturated on 21 May 1948, with a concert that, in a way, &quot;marked his definitive Scaliger consecration and at the same time his authoritative entry into the small number of great international conductors.&quot; Toscanini invited him to guest conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1949. In a note written to Cantelli&#x27;s wife Iris in 1950 after four of these concerts, Toscanini said:
I am happy and moved to inform you of Guido&#x27;s great success and that I introduced him to my orchestra, which loves him as I do. This is the first time in my long career that I have met a young man so gifted. He will go far, very far.
He debuted in America on 15 January 1949, with a &quot;most positive encounter with the New Yorker public&quot;. On 3 January 1952 he was welcomed again by the American public, conducting the New York Philharmonic. Between these two dates, he had been welcomed in Edinburgh (1950), and had completed an acclaimed &quot;tournée&quot; in London.

Cantelli, who had started his career very young in 1940, was already performing in the greatest theatres in Europe and America by 1945. In the course of his brief career, he had conducted not only in many of the most famous concert halls of Europe but also in the United States and South Africa. Besides conducting the NBC Symphony from 1949 to 1954, Cantelli also guest conducted the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the U.S. and the Philharmonia Orchestra in the UK.

While he was conducting in America and Europe and garnering acclaim therein, Cantelli &quot;also continued his triumphal career in his homeland&quot;. After dedicating himself for a long time to symphonic music, Cantelli wanted to return to the &quot;lyric repertoire&quot;. The result of such decision was a memorable &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; conducted by Cantelli at the &quot;Piccola Scala&quot; on 27 January 1956. Cantelli, besides conducting, was also the director of the opera, the cast of which included such prominent names as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Graziella Sciutti. The opera had a triumphal outcome, and it nothing but confirmed Cantelli&#x27;s &quot;exceptional directorial abilities.&quot; The opera was repeated in Johannesburg, where it came to an &quot;equally sensational success.&quot;
He was named Musical Director of La Scala on 16 November 1956. Cantelli was called in the United States to conduct a series of concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, but tragedy struck. He died in the crash of LAI Flight 451 at Orly Airport in Paris, France only a week after he was named director of La Scala, on 24 November. He was 36 years old. Toscanini, who was in failing health and died less than two months later, was not informed of Cantelli&#x27;s death.

At the time of his death, Cantelli was being considered as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic, as successor to Dimitri Mitropoulos; instead, Leonard Bernstein (who also guest conducted the NBC Symphony) was appointed conductor of the Philharmonic in 1958.

Toscanini had elected Cantelli his &quot;spiritual heir&quot; since the beginning of his career. A &quot;sensible and refined artist&quot;, Cantelli is remembered as a &quot;living presence in the Italian music world&quot;, especially as an &quot;admirable example of professional seriousness, whose artistic commitment was constantly aimed at achieving a severe and unquenchable stylistic perfection&quot;. Cantelli had a strong will, and character endowments that enhanced his communicative skills and magnetism. He had a wide repertory, that he always conducted from memory even during rehearsals. He performed &quot;a very rigorous systematic analysis, noting the salient phrases of each composition in the margins of each score, also specifying rhythmic characteristics and interpretative aspects&quot;.

Massimo Mila stated that for Cantelli &quot;conducting was a peremptory and absolute vocation, an inexorable determination&quot;, which allowed him, in a short time, to size &quot;the most recondite secrets of the art of conducting, and to reach a surprising artistic maturity very soon&quot;. He studied with the greatest, learning their secrets and benefiting from their experience, yet never imitating anyone, &quot;manifesting without hesitation his artistic personality&quot;, entering, in each execution, in an &quot;almost supernatural state that isolated him from the surrounding world&quot;.

Cantelli had been made &quot;one of the most representative figures in the contemporary directorial panorama&quot; by the aforementioned gifts along with, among other things, his communicative skills with the orchestra and the public, the natural &quot;limpidity&quot; of his gesture, his magnetism, and his interpretative versatility. It is not a case that he was considered the living heir of Toscanini.

===Performances and recordings===
Cantelli left a small legacy of commercial and live recordings. Among these are recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s 7th symphony (ASD 254) and 5th piano concerto (with Walter Gieseking and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in Carnegie Hall from 25 March 1956), Symphony No. 29 (Mozart) on HMV&#x27;s ALP 1461, Schubert&#x27;s 8th symphony (ALP 1325), Brahms&#x27; 1st (ALP 1152) and 3rd symphonies (BLP 1083), Franck&#x27;s D minor symphony (ALP 1219 mono issue) (with the NBC Symphony in Carnegie Hall in stereo from 6 April 1954), Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Liszt&#x27;s 2nd piano concerto with Claudio Arrau, and shorter pieces by Ravel (ALP 1207), Rossini, and others. He recorded Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia Records. He recorded a fine performance of Tchaikovsky’s Pathetique Symphony with The Philharmonia Orchestra [HMV]

His one surviving opera performance is of &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, from La Scala in 1956. There is also a live recording of the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot; (with Herva Nelli). He conducted the Mozart &quot;Requiem&quot; at La Scala in 1950. There are live recordings with the New York Philharmonic of Beethoven&#x27;s first and fifth piano concertos, with Rudolf Serkin as soloist, from 1953 and 1954, respectively.

The Franck, Brahms 3rd, Schubert 8th, and Beethoven 7th symphonies were among his few stereo recordings. Just before his death, Cantelli recorded the final three movements of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in stereo for EMI, but did not record the first movement, due to a construction project outside London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall. In recent years, many performances from broadcasts and recording sessions with the NBC Symphony, from 1949 to 1954, have been made available.

==Personal life==
Cantelli&#x27;s wife was Iris Cantelli, née Bilucaglia, the daughter of a noted Istrian Italian paediatrician and obstetrician, who had to leave his native land in the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus. They had a son together, Leonardo, who was but 5 months old at the time of his father&#x27;s death.

<doc id="252495" wikidata="Q44386" url="?curid=252495" title="Leontius">
<text>Leontius (; died 15 February 706) was Byzantine emperor from 695 to 698. Little is known of his early life, other than that he was born in Isauria in Asia Minor. He was given the title of &quot;patrikios&quot;, and made &quot;strategos&quot; of the Anatolic Theme under Emperor Constantine IV. He led forces against the Umayyads during the early years of Justinian II&#x27;s reign, securing victory and forcing the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, to sue for peace.

In 692, Justinian declared war upon the Umayyads again, and sent Leontius to campaign against them. However, he was defeated decisively at the Battle of Sebastopolis, and imprisoned by Justinian for his failure. He was released in 695, and given the title of &quot;strategos&quot; of the Theme of Hellas in Southern Greece. After being released, he led a rebellion against Justinian, and seized power, becoming emperor in the same year.

He ruled until 698, when he was overthrown by Apsimarus, a &quot;droungarios&quot; who had taken part in a failed expedition that had been launched by Leontius to recover Carthage. After seizing Constantinople, Apsimar took the name Tiberius (III), and had Leontius&#x27; nose and tongue cut off. He was sent to the Monastery of Dalmatou, where he remained until some time between August 705 and February 706. By this time Justinian had retaken the throne. Both Leontius and Tiberius were executed.

==Origin and early life==
Little of Leontius&#x27; early life is known, other than that he was from Isauria, and possibly of Armenian descent. Christian Settipani speculates that Leontius was the son of a certain Lazarus, who was the direct descendant of emperor Phocas and general Priscus. Furthermore, Settipani identifies patrikios Tarasius as Leontius&#x27; son. Leontius was appointed as &quot;strategos&quot; of the Anatolic Theme, at the time the most senior military command of the Byzantine Empire, and &quot;patrikios&quot; by Emperor Constantine IV, possibly AD.

Starting in 680, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate erupted into a civil war, known as the Second Fitna. Umayyad authority was challenged even in their metropolitan province of Syria, while most of the Caliphate recognized Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr instead. Under Marwan I and his son Abd al-Malik, however, the Umayyads gained the upper hand, although the Zubayrids were not finally defeated until 692.

The civil war in the Umayyad Caliphate provided an opportunity for the Byzantine Empire to attack its weakened rival, and, in 686, Emperor Justinian II sent Leontius to invade Umayyad territory in Armenia and Iberia, where he campaigned successfully, before leading troops into Media and Caucasian Albania; during these campaigns he gathered loot. Leontius&#x27; successful campaigns compelled the Umayyad Caliph, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, to sue for peace in 688, agreeing to tender part of the taxes from Umayyad territory in Armenia, Iberia, and Cyprus, and to renew a treaty signed originally under Constantine IV, providing for a weekly tribute of 1,000 pieces of gold, one horse, and one slave.

Justinian invaded the Caliphate again in 692, feeling that the Umayyads were in a weak position, but was repulsed at the Battle of Sebastopolis, where a large number of Slavs defected to the Umayyads, ensuring the Byzantine defeat. After this, the Umayyads renewed their invasion of North Africa, aimed at taking the city of Carthage in the Exarchate of Africa, and also invaded Anatolia. Around this time, Justinian imprisoned Leontius. Some Byzantine sources, such as Nikephoros and Theophanes, suggest that Justinian did so because he believed that Leontius was seeking to take the throne, but it is possible that the crushing defeat at Sebastopolis played a part in his imprisonment; as &quot;strategos&quot; of the Anatolic Theme, he likely served in the battle, and may have even been the main Byzantine commander in it.

After further setbacks in the war, Justinian released Leontius in 695 because he feared losing control of Carthage, and appointed him &quot;strategos&quot; of the Theme of Hellas in Southern Greece. During his captivity, Leontius was cared for by two monks, Gregorios and Paulos, who prophesied his rise to the throne, and encouraged him to rise against Justinian after his release. Leontius, once free, quickly raised a rebellion against Justinian. Leontius had wide support from the aristocracy, who opposed Justinian&#x27;s land policies, which restricted the aristocracy&#x27;s ability to acquire land from peasant freeholders, and the peasantry, who opposed Justinian&#x27;s tax policies, as well as the Blue faction (one of the Hippodrome factions), and the Patriarch of Constantinople Callinicus. Leontius and his supporters seized Justinian and brought him to the Hippodrome, where Justinian&#x27;s nose was cut off, a common practice in Byzantine culture, done in order to remove threats to the throne, as mutilated people were traditionally barred from becoming emperor; however, Leontius did not kill Justinian, out of reverence for Constantine IV. After Justinian&#x27;s nose was cut off, Leontius exiled him to Cherson, a Byzantine exclave in the Crimea.

==Reign and downfall==

Upon his coronation, Leontius, now known as &quot;Leo&quot;, adopted a moderate political stance. He restricted the activity of the Byzantine army, allowing small raids against the border of the Byzantine empire to proceed without reprisal, and instead focused upon consolidation. Very little is known of his domestic policy, except that he had the port of Neorion in Constantinople cleared, which allegedly led to a four-month outbreak of plague.

The Umayyads, emboldened by Leontius″ perceived weakness, invaded the Exarchate of Africa in 696, capturing Carthage in 697. Leontius sent the &quot;patrikios&quot; John to retake the city. John was able to seize Carthage after a surprise attack on its harbor. However, Umayyad reinforcements soon retook the city, forcing John to retreat to Crete and regroup. A group of officers, fearing the Emperor&#x27;s punishment for their failure, revolted and proclaimed Apsimar, a &quot;droungarios&quot; (mid-level commander) of the Cibyrrhaeots, emperor.

Apsimar took the regnal name Tiberius, gathered a fleet and allied himself with the Green faction, before sailing for Constantinople, which was enduring the bubonic plague. After several months of siege, the city surrendered to Tiberius, in 698. Tiberius captured Leontius, and had his nose slit before imprisoning him in the Monastery of Dalmatou. Leontius stayed in the monastery under guard until Justinian retook the throne with the assistance of the Bulgar king Tervel in 705. Justinian then had both Leontius and Tiberius dragged to the Hippodrome and publicly humiliated, before being taken away and beheaded. The execution took place on 15 February 706 according to the 13th-century &quot;Chronicon Altinate&quot;. The body of Leontius was thrown into the sea alongside Tiberius, but was later recovered and buried in a church on the island of Prote.

<doc id="252496" wikidata="Q725041" url="?curid=252496" title="Jack Herer">
<text>Jack Herer (; June 18, 1939 – April 15, 2010), sometimes called the &quot;Emperor of Hemp&quot;, was an American cannabis rights activist and the author of the 1985 book &quot;The Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot;. Herer founded and served as the director of the organization Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP).

As an activist, he advocated for the decriminalization of the cannabis plant and argued that it could be used as a renewable source of fuel, medicine, food, fiber, and paper/pulp and that it can be grown in virtually any part of the world for medicinal as well as economic purposes. He further asserted that the U.S. government has been deliberately hiding the proof of this from its own citizens. 

==Biography==
An early glass pipe entrepreneur, Herer opened his first head shop in 1973.

In 1985, Herer self-published &quot;The Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot;, a book — in 2020 in its fourteenth edition after having been continuously in print for 35 years — frequently cited in efforts to decriminalize and legalize cannabis and to expand the use of hemp for industrial use.
In 1987, Herer opened the Third Eye Shoppe head shop in Portland, Oregon. Herer&#x27;s son Mark Herer took over as the shop&#x27;s owner in 2001. The Third Eye closed on March 31, 2017.

A former Goldwater Republican, Herer twice ran for President of the United States, in 1988 (1,949 votes) and 1992 (3,875 votes), as the Grassroots Party candidate.

===Health problems and death ===

In July 2000, Herer suffered a minor heart attack and a major stroke while attending the BioFach trade show, resulting in difficulties speaking and moving the right side of his body. Herer mostly recovered, and claimed in May 2004 that treatment with the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, a psychoactive mushroom, was the &quot;secret&quot;.

On September 12, 2009, Herer suffered another heart attack while backstage at the Hempstalk Festival in Portland, Oregon.

He was discharged to another facility on October 13, 2009. Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation said, &quot;He is waking up and gazing appropriately when someone is talking... but he is not really communicating in any way.&quot; 

On April 15, 2010, Herer died in Eugene, Oregon, from complications related to the September 2009 heart attack. He was 70 years old at the time of his death. Herer was buried at the Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Mission Hills, California.

==Criticism==
European experts on hemp, like Dr. Hayo M.G. van der Werf, author of the doctoral thesis &quot;Crop physiology of fibre hemp&quot; (1994), and Dr. Ivan Bocsa criticized Herer for making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp (cf. the work of Lyster Hoxie Dewey).

* Herer claimed that hemp produces higher yields than other crops. Van der Werf argued that is simply wrong. Under most favorable growing conditions, other crops such as maize, sugar beet, or potato produced similar dry matter yields. Fiber hemp is in many ways superior to other crops under adverse growing conditions.
* Herer claimed that hemp hurds, which make up 60 to 80% of the stem dry weight, contain 77% cellulose. Van der Werf argued that is wrong. Cellulose content of hemp hurds has been found to vary between 32 and 38% (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer confused the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the hemp stem. The bark contains the long bast fibers which are used in textile manufacturing.

== Legacy ==
A sativa-dominant hybrid strain of cannabis was named after Herer in honor of his work. The Jack Herer strain was originally created by Sensi Seeds. Today almost all seed banks carry their own take on this famous cannabis favorite. This strain has won several awards, including the 7th &quot;High Times&quot; Cannabis Cup. Jack Herer was also inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame at the 16th Cannabis Cup in recognition of his first book.

&quot;Emperor of Hemp&quot; is a documentary made about Herer&#x27;s life that aired on PBS stations throughout the U.S., and was translated into French and Spanish.

<text>The governor of Louisiana is the head of government of the U.S. state of Louisiana. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Louisiana&#x27;s state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.
Republican Jeff Landry has served as the current governor since January 8, 2024.

==List of governors==

===Territory of Orleans===

Louisiana was purchased by the United States from France in 1803. On October 1, 1804, Orleans Territory was organized from the southern part of the Purchase, with the remainder being made the District of Louisiana and placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory. The District of Louisiana would later become Louisiana Territory, but after Orleans Territory became the state of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory.

===State of Louisiana===
Louisiana was admitted to the Union on April 30, 1812. It seceded from the Union on January 26, 1861, and it was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861. However, since substantial parts of the state remained in Union hands throughout the war, there were two lines of governors elected. Following the end of the American Civil War, Louisiana during Reconstruction was part of the Fifth Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.

The 1812 constitution established the office of governor, to serve for four years starting from the fourth Monday after the election. In 1845, the start date was moved to the fourth Monday of the January after the election; in 1864, it was moved to the second Monday of the January after the election; in 1879 it was moved to the first Monday after the General Assembly announced the election result; the 1921 Constitution fixed the new inauguration date as the second Tuesday in May. The 1974 Constitution changed the date, effective in 1980, to the second Monday of the March following the election; this was amended in 1987, to become effective in 1992, to the second Monday of January. Governors were not allowed to succeed themselves until 1864, when the constitution held no term limits. The restriction on governors succeeding themselves was reintroduced in 1868, removed in 1870, and again added in 1898. An amendment to the constitution passed in 1966 allowed governors to succeed themselves once before requiring a gap before they can be elected again. Five governors have served nonconsecutive terms. Andre B. Roman, Francis T. Nicholls, and Jimmie Davis each served two non-consecutive terms, while Earl Long and Edwin Edwards both served in three distinct stints.

In the event of a vacancy, the President of the Senate originally acted as governor. The 1845 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected at the same time and manner as the governor and who would act as governor in the event of a vacancy. The 1913 constitution established that the lieutenant governor would become governor in case of a vacancy. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

<text>Michael of Cesena (Michele di Cesena or Michele Fuschi) ( 1270 – 29 November 1342) was an Italian Franciscan, minister general of that order, and theologian. His advocacy of evangelical poverty brought him into conflict with Pope John XXII.

==Biography==
Of his early life little is known. He was born at Cesena. Having entered the Franciscan Order, he studied at Paris and took the doctor&#x27;s degree in theology in 1316. He taught theology at Bologna and wrote several commentaries on Holy Scripture and the &quot;Sentences of Peter Lombard&quot;.

At the general chapter in Naples on 31 May 1316, he was elected minister general &quot;in absentia&quot; and went at once to Assisi, where he convoked a chapter to consider the revision of the Constitutions of the order. Returning to Bologna, he issued the document, &quot;Gravi qua premor&quot; (21 August 1316), which, together with several other ordinances regarding the matter of poverty, induced John XXII to publish the bull &quot;Quorumdam exigit&quot; (7 October 1317), whose purpose was to explain the decretals of Nicholas III, &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; (13 August 1279), and of Clement V, &quot;Exivi de paradiso&quot; (6 May 1312). John XXII ordered rebellious spirituals to stop arguing and obey their superiors. Initially, Michael agreed with the pope in suppressing the spirituals, whom he had been unable to persuade to conform.

As the papal bull concerned the principal chapter of the Franciscan Rule, this action caused no little disturbance within the order. Earlier, in an effort to quell the disagreements between the conventuals and the zelanti, Pope Gregory IX had ruled that all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. This was later confirmed by Pope Nicholas III. John XXII reversed this. By the bull &quot;Ad conditorem canonum&quot; of 8 December 1322, he declared it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership.

Michael of Cesena and his supporters opposed this, asserting that in adopting the strict poverty upon which Cesena had insisted in his letters, they were following the example and teaching of Christ and the Apostles. They held the view that since Christ and the Apostles held no property, neither should the Church. Thus the controversy finally shifted to a speculative theological question: whether or not it was consonant with Catholic faith to hold that Christ and the Apostles had no property individually or in common, and while in the famous dispute at Narbonne in 1321 the inquisitor John of Belna claimed that it was heretical, Berengarius of Perpignan declared it a Catholic dogma in perfect accordance with the decretals of Nicholas III and Clement V.

The matter having been brought before John XXII, a further attempt to settle the controversy was made by distinguishing between dominion and simple use, so that both propositions, Christ and the Apostles had no property, i.e., dominion of property, and Christ and the Apostles possessed property, i.e., the use of property, were true. In the bull &quot;Quia nonnunquam&quot; (26 March 1322) the pope declared that he intended merely to explain the decrees of his predecessors, and excommunicated anyone who attempted to misconstrue the meaning of the papal Constitution &quot;Quorumdam exigit&quot;.

In June of the same year a general chapter of the order was convoked at Perugia and decided that to assert that Christ and His Apostles possessed no earthly goods was not only not heretical, but sound and Catholic doctrine. At the same time, Bonagratia of Bergamo was commissioned to represent the chapter before the Papal Curia, at Avignon.

===Summons to Avignon===

The controversy continued unabated until, in 1327, Michael was summoned to appear before the pope in Avignon in 1327. Michael eventually agreed to go, after feigning illness and delaying. He obeyed a subsequent summons and was forbidden by the pope under pain of grave censure to leave Avignon. He was thus unable to attend the chapter held at Bologna in May of the following year (1328). Despite his absence and the protest of the papal legate, he was reelected minister general, the chapter deeming the charges against him insufficient to deprive him of office.

Michael managed to win over William of Ockham to his cause. Several prelates and princes wrote to the pope on Cesena&#x27;s behalf. In the following year, Michael of Cesena, William of Ockham and a few other high-ranking Franciscans fled from the papal court. They had apparently wished to seek the protection of King Robert of Naples (who favored their views), but a storm on the Mediterranean forced their galley back to the port of Aigues-Mortes, where they transferred to another ship manned by agents of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor and were taken to Pisa.

===Deposition===

At Pisa they were received by the party of Louis and were joined by a number of other schismatics. John XXII was declared to be deposed by the emperor. Michael of Cesena was excommunicated by the Pope. He published a solemn appeal from the pope to a council (12 December 1328), posting it on the door of the cathedral.

The general chapter of Paris (11 June 1329), at which Cardinal Bertrand presided, deposed Michael was from the Franciscan leadership, condemned his writings and his and his followers&#x27; conduct and elected Gerard Odon minister general of the Franciscan Order.

The pope issued the encyclical &quot;Quia vir reprobus&quot;, warning the faithful against Michael, and the latter answered in his &quot;Ad perpetuam rei memoriam innotescat quod ego, Fr. Michael&quot; (25 November 1330) and in &quot;Christianæ fidei fundamentum&quot;, in which he accused the pope of heresy in the three Bulls, &quot;Ad Conditorem Canonum&quot;, &quot;Cum inter nonnullos&quot;, and &quot;Quia quorumdam&quot;. These and &quot;Litteras plurium magistrorum&quot;, and &quot;Teste Solomone&quot; which Michael wrote in his own defence, are contained in William of Ockham&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot;.

===Later life===

The chapter of Perpignan (25 April 1331) expelled him from the order and sentenced him to perpetual imprisonment. He continued to struggle for his understanding of evangelical poverty for the rest of his life, and issued an appeal against Benedict XII, who had succeeded John XXII, in 1338. He died in Munich, and was buried there in the Franciscan convent, the Barfüsserkirche. He was officially rehabilitated in 1359.

==Cultural references==
Michael of Cesena is one of the historical characters in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. Much of his history is recounted through conversations between the main characters William of Baskerville and Adso.

<doc id="252505" wikidata="Q878581" url="?curid=252505" title="List of governors of Ohio">
<text>The governor of Ohio is the head of government of Ohio and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. state&#x27;s military forces. The officeholder has a duty to enforce state laws, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Ohio General Assembly, the power to convene the legislature and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.

There have been 64 governors of Ohio, serving 70 distinct terms. The longest term was held by Jim Rhodes, who was elected four times and served just under sixteen years in two non-consecutive periods of two terms each (1963–1971 and 1975–1983). The shortest terms were held by John William Brown and Nancy Hollister, who each served for only 11 days after the governors preceding them resigned in order to begin the terms to which they had been elected in the United States Senate; the shortest-serving elected governor was John M. Pattison, who died in office five months into his term. 

The current governor is Republican Mike DeWine (R), who took office on January 14, 2019, and was re-elected in 2022. After eight years the incumbent is term-limited and ineligible to seek a third consecutive term in the 2026 Ohio gubernatorial election.

==Qualifications==
To become governor of Ohio, a candidate must be a qualified elector in the state. This means that any candidate for governor must be at least 18 years old at the time of election, a resident of Ohio for at least 30 days before the election, and a U.S. citizen. Convicted felons and those deemed by the courts as incompetent to vote are not eligible. There is a term limit of two consecutive terms as governor.

==Powers==
The governor is the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws; the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Ohio State Legislature; the power to convene the legislature; and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.

Other duties and privileges of the office include:

* Executing all laws and requiring written information on any office from the head of that office 
* Making an annual address to the General Assembly, with recommendation for legislation 
* Convening extraordinary sessions of the legislature with limited purposes 
* Adjourning the legislature when the two chambers cannot agree to do so themselves, not to include the privilege of adjourning the legislature past the sine die set for the regular session 
* Keeping and using &quot;The Great Seal of the State of Ohio&quot; 
* Signing and sealing all commissions granted in the name of the state of Ohio 
* Nominating, in the event of a vacancy in the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s office, a new officer, subject to a confirmatory vote of both chambers of the legislature 
* Making vacancy appointments for all &quot;key state officers&quot; (the Auditor, the Treasurer, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General. Such appointments are for the remainder of the term when the next general election is less than 40 days away and until the next general election otherwise 
* Accepting a report from the head of each executive department at least once a year, not later than five days before the regular session of the legislature convenes, and including the substance of those reports in the annual address to the legislature 
* Making all appointments not otherwise provided for, with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless the Senate refuses to act, in which case the Governor&#x27;s appointee takes offices by default

==Succession==

Should the office of governor become vacant due to death, resignation, or conviction of impeachment, the lieutenant governor assumes the title of governor. Should the office of lieutenant governor also become vacant, the president of the senate becomes the acting governor. If the vacancy of both offices took place during the first twenty months of the term, a special election is to be held on the next even-numbered year to elect new officers to serve out the current term. Prior to 1851, the speaker of the senate acted as governor for the term. Since 1978, the governor and lieutenant governor have been elected on the same ticket; prior to then, they could be (and often were) members of different parties.

==List of governors==
===Northwest Territory===
The Territory Northwest of the Ohio River, commonly known as the Northwest Territory, was organized on July 13, 1787. Many territories and states were split from Northwest Territory over the years, with the last portion being split between Indiana Territory and the newly admitted state of Ohio on March 1, 1803.

Throughout its 15-year history, Northwest Territory had only one governor appointed by the federal government, Arthur St. Clair. He was removed from office by President Thomas Jefferson on November 22, 1802, and no successor was named; Secretary of the Territory Charles Willing Byrd acted as governor until statehood.

===State of Ohio===

Ohio was admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803. Since then, it has had 64 governors, six of whom (Allen Trimble, Wilson Shannon, Rutherford B. Hayes, James M. Cox, Frank Lausche, and Jim Rhodes) served non-consecutive terms.

The first constitution of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two-year terms, limited to six of any eight years, commencing on the first Monday in the December following an election. The current constitution of 1851 removed the term limit, and shifted the start of the term to the second Monday in January following an election. In 1908, Ohio switched from holding elections in odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, with the preceding governor (from the 1905 election) serving an extra year. A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again. An Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1973 clarified this to mean governors could theoretically serve unlimited terms, as long as they waited four years after every second term.

<doc id="252506" wikidata="Q41637" url="?curid=252506" title="Tiberius III">
<text>Tiberius III (), born Apsimar (; ), was Byzantine emperor from 698 to 705. Little is known about his early life, other than that he was a , a mid-level commander, who served in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme. In 696, Tiberius was part of an army sent by Byzantine Emperor Leontius to retake the North African city of Carthage, which had been captured by the Arab Umayyads. After seizing the city, this army was pushed back by Umayyad reinforcements and retreated to the island of Crete. As they feared the wrath of Leontius, some officers killed their commander, John the Patrician, and declared Tiberius the emperor. Tiberius swiftly gathered a fleet and sailed for Constantinople, where he then deposed Leontius. Tiberius did not attempt to retake Byzantine Africa from the Umayyads, but campaigned against them along the eastern border with some success. In 705, former emperor Justinian II, who had been deposed by Leontius, led an army of Slavs and Bulgars from the First Bulgarian Empire to Constantinople, and after entering the city secretly, deposed Tiberius. Tiberius fled to Bithynia, but was captured a few months later and beheaded by Justinian between August 705 and February 706. His body was initially thrown into the sea, but was later recovered and buried in a church on the island of Prote.

==History==
===Early life===
Sparse details are known of Tiberius before the reign of Byzantine emperor Leontius (), except for his birth name, &quot;Apsimar&quot;, historically considered to be of Germanic origin. The historian Wolfram Brandes traces the traditional assumption of a Germanic origin to J. B. Bury, but remarks that it is incorrect. The Byzantinists Anthony Bryer and Judith Herrin have suggested that the name &quot;Apsimar&quot; may be Slavic in origin, and the scholars Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon have suggested a Turkic origin. It is also known that he was a (a commander of about a thousand men) of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, a military province in southern Anatolia. Some scholars, such as Alexander Vasiliev, have speculated that Tiberius was of Gotho-Greek origin. The Byzantinist Walter Kaegi states that Tiberius had won victories over the Slavs in the Balkans during his early military career, which granted him a degree of popularity.

===Background===

In 696, the Umayyad Caliphate renewed its attack upon the Exarchate of Africa of the Byzantine Empire, seizing the city of Carthage in 697. The Byzantine Emperor Leontius sent John the Patrician with an army to retake the city, which John accomplished after launching a surprise attack on its harbor. Despite this initial success, the city was swiftly retaken by Umayyad reinforcements, which forced John to retreat to the island of Crete to regroup. A group of officers who feared Leontius″s wrath for failing to recapture Carthage killed John, and declared Apsimar emperor. Apsimar took the regnal name &quot;Tiberius&quot;; during this period, the selection of a regnal name was quite common, but later fell out of favor. He gathered a fleet and allied himself with the Greens (one of the Hippodrome sports and political factions), before sailing for Constantinople, which was enduring an outbreak of the bubonic plague. Tiberius and his troops landed at the port of Sykai on the Golden Horn, and then proceeded to lay siege to the city. After several months, the gates of Constantinople were opened for Tiberius″s forces by members of the Green faction, allowing Tiberius to seize the city and depose Leontius; this did not prevent his troops from plundering the city. Tiberius had Leontius″s nose slit, and sent him to live in the Monastery of Psamathion in Constantinople. According to the 12th-century chronicler Michael the Syrian, himself citing an unnamed contemporary 8th-century Syriac source, Tiberius justified his coup by pointing to Leontius&#x27; own dethroning of Emperor Justinian II () for mismanaging the empire as precedent. Before Tiberius, no naval officer had ever assumed the throne, partly because Byzantines considered the army far more prestigious.

===Rule===

Tiberius was crowned by Patriarch Callinicus I of Constantinople shortly after seizing control of Constantinople and deposing Leontius. Once in power, Tiberius did not attempt to retake Byzantine Africa from the Umayyads but rather focused his attention upon the eastern border of his empire. Tiberius appointed his brother, Heraclius, as (a prestigious courtly title) and (head general) of the Anatolian themes (Byzantine administrative regions): the possessions of the Byzantine Empire located in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Heraclius invaded the Umayyad Caliphate in late autumn of 698, crossing the passes of the Taurus Mountains into Cilicia before marching for northern Syria. Heraclius defeated an Arab army sent from Antioch, then raided as far as Samosata before pulling back to the safety of Byzantine lands in spring of 699.

Heraclius&#x27; military successes led to a series of punitive Arab attacks: the Umayyad generals Muhammad ibn Marwan and Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik conquered what little remained of the Byzantine&#x27;s territory in Armenia in a string of campaigns to which Heraclius was unable to effectively respond. The Armenians launched a large revolt against the Umayyads in 702, requesting Byzantine aid. Then al-Malik launched a campaign to reconquer Armenia in 704 but was attacked by Heraclius in Cilicia. Heraclius defeated the Arab army of 10,000–12,000 men led by Yazid ibn Hunayn at Sisium, killing most and enslaving the rest; in spite of this, Heraclius was not able to stop al-Malik from reconquering Armenia.

Tiberius attempted to strengthen the Byzantine military by reorganizing its structure, as well as reorganizing the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme, and repairing the sea walls of Constantinople. Tiberius also focused his attention on the island of Cyprus, which had been underpopulated since many of the inhabitants were moved to the region of Cyzicus under his predecessor, Justinian II: Tiberius successfully negotiated with Abd al-Malik in 698/699 to allow the Cypriots who had been moved to Cyzicus, and those who had been captured by the Arabs and taken to Syria, to return to their homelands. He also strengthened the garrison of the island with Mardaite troops from the Taurus Mountains. According to the historian Warren Treadgold, Tiberius attempted to contain the Arabs at sea by creating new military provinces, creating the Theme of Sardinia and separating the Theme of Sicily from the Exarchate of Ravenna. Tiberius also banished the future emperor Philippicus, the son of a , to the island of Cephalonia.

In 702, Justinian II escaped from the Theme of Cherson (modern Crimea) and gained the support of Khagan Busir (), leader of the Khazars, who gave Justinian his sister Theodora as a bride, and welcomed him to his court in Phanagoria. By 703, reports that Justinian was attempting to gain support to retake the throne reached Tiberius, who swiftly sent envoys to the Khazars demanding that Justinian be handed over to the Byzantines, dead or alive. Justinian eluded capture, and sought the support of the khan of the First Bulgarian Empire, Tervel (). In 705, Justinian led an army of Slavs and Bulgars to Constantinople and laid siege to it for three days before scouts discovered an old and disused conduit that ran under the walls of the city. Justinian and a small detachment of soldiers used this route to gain access to the city, exited at the northern edge of the wall near the Palace of Blachernae, and quickly seized the building. Tiberius fled to the city of Sozopolis in Bithynia, and eluded his pursuers for several months before being captured. The exact timing of Justinian″s siege and Tiberius″ capture is convoluted. According to the numismatist Philip Grierson, Justinian II entered the city on 21 August, but according to the Byzantinist Constance Head, Justinian seized the city on 10 July, and the 21 August date is instead the date when Tiberius was captured in Sozopolis, or else the date when he was transported back to Constantinople. Six months later, probably on 15 February, Justinian had both Leontius and Tiberius dragged to the Hippodrome and publicly humiliated, before being taken away to the Kynegion (a city quarter near the Kynegos Gate) and beheaded. Their bodies were thrown into the sea, but were later recovered and buried in a church on the island of Prote.

====Legacy====
Head comments that although little is known of Tiberius, the evidence points to him being a &quot;conscientious and effective ruler&quot;, and states that he might be remembered as &quot;one of the truly great emperors of Byzantium&quot; if he had reigned longer. Kaegi states that succeeding dynasties of the Byzantine Empire, and their associated historians, tend to blame the permanent loss of Byzantine Africa upon Tiberius, although he posits that, by the time Tiberius took the throne, it was far too late for the Byzantines to restore their control.

===Family===
Tiberius had a son, Theodosius, who became bishop of Ephesus by 729, presided over the Council of Hieria in 754, and advised Emperors Leo III () and Constantine V (). The Byzantinist Graham Sumner has suggested that this son of Tiberius may have later become Emperor Theodosius III (). Sumner presents evidence that both figures held the Bishopric of Ephesus at similar times: Emperor Theodosius became bishop after 716, according to the &quot;Chronicon Altinate&quot;, and Theodosius the son of Tiberius became bishop by 729, suggesting they may be the same person. The Byzantinists Cyril Mango and Roger Scott do not view this theory as likely, as it would mean that Emperor Theodosius had to have lived for thirty more years after his abdication. Other details of Tiberius&#x27;s family, including the name of his spouses, are lost: a common consequence of the upheaval of the period in which Tiberius ruled, known as the Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy.
