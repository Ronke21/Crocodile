<text>D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is now a very different language. As it has developed, it has drawn inspiration from other high-level programming languages. Notably, it has been influenced by Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.

The D language reference describes it as follows:

==Features==
D is not source-compatible with C and C++ source code in general. However, any code that is legal in both C and D should behave in the same way.

Like C++, D has closures, anonymous functions, compile-time function execution, ranges, built-in container iteration concepts, and type inference. D&#x27;s declaration, statement and expression syntaxes also closely match those of C++.

Unlike C++, D also implements design by contract, garbage collection, first class arrays, array slicing, nested functions and lazy evaluation. D uses Java-style single inheritance with interfaces and mixins rather than C++-style multiple inheritance.

D is a systems programming language. Like C++, and unlike application languages such as Java and C#, D supports low-level programming, including inline assembler. Inline assembler allows programmers to enter machine-specific assembly code within standard D code. System programmers use this method to access the low-level features of the processor that are needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying hardware, such as operating systems and device drivers. Low-level programming is also used to write higher performance code than would be produced by a compiler.

D supports function overloading and operator overloading. Symbols (functions, variables, classes) can be declared in any order; forward declarations are not needed.

In D, text character strings are arrays of characters, and arrays in D are bounds-checked. D has first class types for complex and imaginary numbers.

===Programming paradigms===
D supports five main programming paradigms:
* Concurrent (actor model)
* Object-oriented
* Imperative
* Functional
* Metaprogramming

====Imperative====
Imperative programming in D is almost identical to that in C. Functions, data, statements, declarations and expressions work just as they do in C, and the C runtime library may be accessed directly. On the other hand, unlike C, D&#x27;s codice_1 loop construct allows looping over a collection. D also allows nested functions, which are functions that are declared inside another function, and which may access the enclosing function&#x27;s local variables.
import std.stdio;

void main() {
 int multiplier = 10;
 int scaled(int x) {
 return x * multiplier;

 foreach (i; 0 .. 10) {
 writefln(&quot;Hello, world %d! scaled = %d&quot;, i, scaled(i));
}
====Object-oriented====
Object-oriented programming in D is based on a single inheritance hierarchy, with all classes derived from class Object. D does not support multiple inheritance; instead, it uses Java-style interfaces, which are comparable to C++&#x27;s pure abstract classes, and mixins, which separate common functionality from the inheritance hierarchy. D also allows the defining of static and final (non-virtual) methods in interfaces.

Interfaces and inheritance in D support covariant types for return types of overridden methods.

D supports type forwarding, as well as optional custom dynamic dispatch.

Classes (and interfaces) in D can contain invariants which are automatically checked before and after entry to public methods, in accordance with the design by contract methodology.

Many aspects of classes (and structs) can be introspected automatically at compile time (a form of reflective programming (reflection) using codice_2) and at run time (RTTI / codice_3), to facilitate generic code or automatic code generation (usually using compile-time techniques).

====Functional====
D supports functional programming features such as function literals, closures, recursively-immutable objects and the use of higher-order functions. There are two syntaxes for anonymous functions, including a multiple-statement form and a &quot;shorthand&quot; single-expression notation:
int function(int) g;
g = (x) { return x * x; }; // longhand
g = (x) =&gt; x * x; // shorthand
There are two built-in types for function literals, codice_4, which is simply a pointer to a stack-allocated function, and codice_5, which also includes a pointer to the relevant stack frame, the surrounding ‘environment’, which contains the current local variables. Type inference may be used with an anonymous function, in which case the compiler creates a codice_5 unless it can prove that an environment pointer is not necessary. Likewise, to implement a closure, the compiler places enclosed local variables on the heap only if necessary (for example, if a closure is returned by another function, and exits that function&#x27;s scope). When using type inference, the compiler will also add attributes such as codice_7 and codice_8 to a function&#x27;s type, if it can prove that they apply.

Other functional features such as currying and common higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce are available through the standard library modules codice_9 and codice_10.
import std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range;

void main() {
 int[] a1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
 int[] a2 = [6, 7, 8, 9];

 // must be immutable to allow access from inside a pure function
 immutable pivot = 5;

 int mySum(int a, int b) pure nothrow /* pure function */ {
 if (b &lt;= pivot) // ref to enclosing-scope
 return a + b;
 else
 return a;

 // passing a delegate (closure)
 auto result = reduce!mySum(chain(a1, a2));
 writeln(&quot;Result: &quot;, result); // Result: 15

 // passing a delegate literal
 result = reduce!((a, b) =&gt; (b &lt;= pivot) ? a + b : a)(chain(a1, a2));
 writeln(&quot;Result: &quot;, result); // Result: 15


Alternatively, the above function compositions can be expressed using Uniform function call syntax (UFCS) for more natural left-to-right reading:
 auto result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!mySum();
 writeln(&quot;Result: &quot;, result);

 result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!((a, b) =&gt; (b &lt;= pivot) ? a + b : a)();
 writeln(&quot;Result: &quot;, result);
====Parallelism====
Parallel programming concepts are implemented in the library, and do not require extra support from the compiler. However the D type system and compiler ensure that data sharing can be detected and managed transparently.
import std.stdio : writeln;
import std.range : iota;
import std.parallelism : parallel;

void main() {
 foreach (i; iota(11).parallel) {
 // The body of the foreach loop is executed in parallel for each i
 writeln(&quot;processing &quot;, i);
}
codice_11 is equivalent to codice_12 by using UFCS.

The same module also supports codice_13 which can be used for dynamic creation of parallel tasks, as well as map-filter-reduce and fold style operations on ranges (and arrays), which is useful when combined with functional operations. codice_14 returns a lazily evaluated range rather than an array. This way, the elements are computed by each worker task in parallel automatically.
import std.stdio : writeln;
import std.algorithm : map;
import std.range : iota;
import std.parallelism : taskPool;

/* On Intel i7-3930X and gdc 9.3.0:
 * 5140ms using std.algorithm.reduce
 * 888ms using std.parallelism.taskPool.reduce
 * On AMD Threadripper 2950X, and gdc 9.3.0:
 * 2864ms using std.algorithm.reduce
 * 95ms using std.parallelism.taskPool.reduce
void main() {
 auto nums = iota(1.0, 1_000_000_000.0);

 auto x = taskPool.reduce!&quot;a + b&quot;(
 0.0, map!&quot;1.0 / (a * a)&quot;(nums)

 writeln(&quot;Sum: &quot;, x);


====Concurrency====
Concurrency is fully implemented in the library, and it does not require support from the compiler. Alternative implementations and methodologies of writing concurrent code are possible. The use of D typing system does help ensure memory safety.
import std.stdio, std.concurrency, std.variant;

void foo() {
 bool cont = true;

 while (cont) {
 receive( // Delegates are used to match the message type.
 (int msg) =&gt; writeln(&quot;int received: &quot;, msg),
 (Tid sender) { cont = false; sender.send(-1); },
 (Variant v) =&gt; writeln(&quot;huh?&quot;) // Variant matches any type
 }

void main() {
 auto tid = spawn(&amp;foo); // spawn a new thread running foo()

 foreach (i; 0 .. 10)
 tid.send(i); // send some integers

 tid.send(1.0f); // send a float
 tid.send(&quot;hello&quot;); // send a string
 tid.send(thisTid); // send a struct (Tid)

 receive((int x) =&gt; writeln(&quot;Main thread received message: &quot;, x));


====Metaprogramming====
Metaprogramming is supported through templates, compile-time function execution, tuples, and string mixins. The following examples demonstrate some of D&#x27;s compile-time features.

Templates in D can be written in a more imperative style compared to the C++ functional style for templates. This is a regular function that calculates the factorial of a number:
ulong factorial(ulong n) {
 if (n &lt; 2)
 return 1;
 else
 return n * factorial(n-1);


Here, the use of codice_15, D&#x27;s compile-time conditional construct, is demonstrated to construct a template that performs the same calculation using code that is similar to that of the function above:
template Factorial(ulong n) {
 static if (n &lt; 2)
 enum Factorial = 1;
 else
 enum Factorial = n * Factorial!(n-1);


In the following two examples, the template and function defined above are used to compute factorials. The types of constants need not be specified explicitly as the compiler infers their types from the right-hand sides of assignments:
enum fact_7 = Factorial!(7);
This is an example of compile-time function execution (CTFE). Ordinary functions may be used in constant, compile-time expressions provided they meet certain criteria:
enum fact_9 = factorial(9);
The codice_16 function performs codice_17-like data formatting (also at compile-time, through CTFE), and the &quot;msg&quot; pragma displays the result at compile time:
import std.string : format;
pragma(msg, format(&quot;7! = %s&quot;, fact_7));
pragma(msg, format(&quot;9! = %s&quot;, fact_9));
String mixins, combined with compile-time function execution, allow for the generation of D code using string operations at compile time. This can be used to parse domain-specific languages, which will be compiled as part of the program:
import FooToD; // hypothetical module which contains a function that parses Foo source code
 // and returns equivalent D code
void main() {
 mixin(fooToD(import(&quot;example.foo&quot;)));


===Memory management===
Memory is usually managed with garbage collection, but specific objects may be finalized immediately when they go out of scope. This is what the majority of programs and libraries written in D use.

In case more control over memory layout and better performance is needed, explicit memory management is possible using the overloaded operator codice_18, by calling C&#x27;s malloc and free directly, or implementing custom allocator schemes (i.e. on stack with fallback, RAII style allocation, reference counting, shared reference counting). Garbage collection can be controlled: programmers may add and exclude memory ranges from being observed by the collector, can disable and enable the collector and force either a generational or full collection cycle. The manual gives many examples of how to implement different highly optimized memory management schemes for when garbage collection is inadequate in a program.

In functions, codice_19 instances are by default allocated on the stack, while codice_20 instances by default allocated on the heap (with only reference to the class instance being on the stack). However this can be changed for classes, for example using standard library template codice_21, or by using codice_18 for structs and assigning to a pointer instead of a value-based variable.

In functions, static arrays (of known size) are allocated on the stack. For dynamic arrays, one can use the codice_23 function (similar to codice_24 in C), to allocate memory on the stack. The returned pointer can be used (recast) into a (typed) dynamic array, by means of a slice (however resizing array, including appending must be avoided; and for obvious reasons they must not be returned from the function).

A codice_25 keyword can be used both to annotate parts of code, but also variables and classes/structs, to indicate they should be destroyed (destructor called) immediately on scope exit. Whatever the memory is deallocated also depends on implementation and class-vs-struct differences.

codice_26 contains a modular and composable allocator templates, to create custom high performance allocators for special use cases.

===SafeD===
SafeD
is the name given to the subset of D that can be guaranteed to be memory safe. Functions marked codice_27 are checked at compile time to ensure that they do not use any features, such as pointer arithmetic and unchecked casts, that could result in corruption of memory. Any other functions called must also be marked as codice_27 or codice_29. Functions can be marked codice_29 for the cases where the compiler cannot distinguish between safe use of a feature that is disabled in SafeD and a potential case of memory corruption.

====Scope lifetime safety====
Initially under the banners of DIP1000 and DIP25 (now part of the language specification), D provides protections against certain ill-formed constructions involving the lifetimes of data.

The current mechanisms in place primarily deal with function parameters and stack memory however it is a stated ambition of the leadership of the programming language to provide a more thorough treatment of lifetimes within the D programming language (influenced by ideas from Rust programming language).

====Lifetime safety of assignments====
Within @safe code, the lifetime of an assignment involving a reference type is checked to ensure that the lifetime of the assignee is longer than that of the assigned.

For example:

@safe void test() {
 int tmp = 0; // #1
 int* rad; // #2
 rad = &amp;tmp; // If the order of the declarations of #1 and #2 is reversed, this fails.
 int bad = 45; // The lifetime of &quot;bad&quot; only extends to the scope in which it is defined.
 *rad = bad; // This is valid.
 rad = &amp;bad; // The lifetime of rad is longer than bad, hence this is not valid.
}
====Function parameter lifetime annotations within @safe code====
When applied to function parameter which are either of pointer type or references, the keywords &quot;return&quot; and &quot;scope&quot; constrain the lifetime and use of that parameter.

The language standard dictates the following behaviour:

An annotated example is given below.
@safe:

int* gp;
void thorin(scope int*);
void gloin(int*);
int* balin(return scope int* p, scope int* q, int* r) {
 gp = p; // Error, p escapes to global variable gp.
 gp = q; // Error, q escapes to global variable gp.
 gp = r; // OK.

 thorin(p); // OK, p does not escape thorin().
 thorin(q); // OK.
 thorin(r); // OK.

 gloin(p); // Error, p escapes gloin().
 gloin(q); // Error, q escapes gloin().
 gloin(r); // OK that r escapes gloin().

 return p; // OK.
 return q; // Error, cannot return &#x27;scope&#x27; q.
 return r; // OK.


===Interaction with other systems===
C&#x27;s application binary interface (ABI) is supported, as well as all of C&#x27;s fundamental and derived types, enabling direct access to existing C code and libraries. D bindings are available for many popular C libraries. Additionally, C&#x27;s standard library is part of standard D.

On Microsoft Windows, D can access Component Object Model (COM) code.

As long as memory management is properly taken care of, many other languages can be mixed with D in a single binary. For example, the GDC compiler allows to link and intermix C, C++, and other supported language codes such as Objective-C. D code (functions) can also be marked as using C, C++, Pascal ABIs, and thus be passed to the libraries written in these languages as callbacks. Similarly data can be interchanged between the codes written in these languages in both ways. This usually restricts use to primitive types, pointers, some forms of arrays, unions, structs, and only some types of function pointers.

Because many other programming languages often provide the C API for writing extensions or running the interpreter of the languages, D can interface directly with these languages as well, using standard C bindings (with a thin D interface file). For example, there are bi-directional bindings for languages like Python, Lua and other languages, often using compile-time code generation and compile-time type reflection methods.

====Interaction with C++ code====

For D code marked as codice_31, the following features are specified:

* The name mangling conventions shall match those of C++ on the target.
* For function calls, the ABI shall be equivalent.
* The vtable shall be matched up to single inheritance (the only level supported by the D language specification).

C++ namespaces are used via the syntax codice_32 where &quot;namespace&quot; is the name of the C++ namespace.

=====An example of C++ interoperation=====
The C++ side

import std;

class Base {
 public:
 virtual void print3i(int a, int b, int c) = 0;

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
 int field;
 Derived(int field): 
 field(field) {}

 void print3i(int a, int b, int c) {
 std::println(&quot;a = {}&quot;, a);
 std::println(&quot;b = {}&quot;, b);
 std::println(&quot;c = {}&quot;, c);

 int mul(int factor);

int Derived::mul(int factor) {
 return field * factor;

Derived* createInstance(int i) {
 return new Derived(i);

void deleteInstance(Derived*&amp; d) {
 delete d;
 d = 0;


The D side

extern(C++) {
 abstract class Base {
 void print3i(int a, int b, int c);

 class Derived : Base {
 int field;
 @disable this();
 override void print3i(int a, int b, int c);
 final int mul(int factor);

 Derived createInstance(int i);
 void deleteInstance(ref Derived d);

void main() {
 import std.stdio;

 auto d1 = createInstance(5);
 writeln(d1.field);
 writeln(d1.mul(4));

 Base b1 = d1;
 b1.print3i(1, 2, 3);

 deleteInstance(d1);
 assert(d1 is null);

 auto d2 = createInstance(42);
 writeln(d2.field);

 deleteInstance(d2);
 assert(d2 is null);


===Better C===
The D programming language has an official subset known as &quot;&quot;. This subset forbids access to D features requiring use of runtime libraries other than that of C.

Enabled via the compiler flags &quot;-betterC&quot; on DMD and LDC, and &quot;-fno-druntime&quot; on GDC, may only call into D code compiled under the same flag (and linked code other than D) but code compiled without the option may call into code compiled with it: this will, however, lead to slightly different behaviours due to differences in how C and D handle asserts.

==History==
Walter Bright started working on a new language in 1999. D was first released in December 2001 and reached version 1.0 in January 2007. The first version of the language (D1) concentrated on the imperative, object oriented and metaprogramming paradigms, similar to C++.

Some members of the D community dissatisfied with Phobos, D&#x27;s official runtime and standard library, created an alternative runtime and standard library named Tango. The first public Tango announcement came within days of D 1.0&#x27;s release. Tango adopted a different programming style, embracing OOP and high modularity. Being a community-led project, Tango was more open to contributions, which allowed it to progress faster than the official standard library. At that time, Tango and Phobos were incompatible due to different runtime support APIs (the garbage collector, threading support, etc.). This made it impossible to use both libraries in the same project. The existence of two libraries, both widely in use, has led to significant dispute due to some packages using Phobos and others using Tango.

In June 2007, the first version of D2 was released. The beginning of D2&#x27;s development signaled D1&#x27;s stabilization. The first version of the language has been placed in maintenance, only receiving corrections and implementation bugfixes. D2 introduced breaking changes to the language, beginning with its first experimental const system. D2 later added numerous other language features, such as closures, purity, and support for the functional and concurrent programming paradigms. D2 also solved standard library problems by separating the runtime from the standard library. The completion of a D2 Tango port was announced in February 2012.

The release of Andrei Alexandrescu&#x27;s book &quot;The D Programming Language&quot; on 12 June 2010, marked the stabilization of D2, which today is commonly referred to as just &quot;D&quot;.

In January 2011, D development moved from a bugtracker / patch-submission basis to GitHub. This has led to a significant increase in contributions to the compiler, runtime and standard library.

In December 2011, Andrei Alexandrescu announced that D1, the first version of the language, would be discontinued on 31 December 2012. The final D1 release, D v1.076, was on 31 December 2012.

Code for the official D compiler, the &quot;Digital Mars D compiler&quot; by Walter Bright, was originally released under a custom license, qualifying as source available but not conforming to the Open Source Definition. In 2014, the compiler front-end was re-licensed as open source under the Boost Software License. This re-licensed code excluded the back-end, which had been partially developed at Symantec. On 7 April 2017, the whole compiler was made available under the Boost license after Symantec gave permission to re-license the back-end, too. On 21 June 2017, the D Language was accepted for inclusion in GCC.

==Implementations==
Most current D implementations compile directly into machine code.

Production ready compilers:

* &quot;DMD&quot; – The &quot;Digital Mars D compiler&quot; by Walter Bright is the official D compiler; open sourced under the Boost Software License. The DMD frontend is shared by GDC (now in GCC) and LDC, to improve compatibility between compilers. Initially the frontend was written in C++, but now most of it is written in D itself (self-hosting). The backend and machine code optimizers are based on the Symantec compiler. At first it supported only 32-bit x86, with support added for 64-bit amd64 and PowerPC by Walter Bright. Later the backend and almost the entire compiler was ported from C++ to D for full self-hosting.
* &quot;GCC&quot; – The GNU Compiler Collection, merged GDC into GCC 9 on 29 October 2018. The first working versions of GDC with GCC, based on GCC 3.3 and GCC 3.4 on 32-bit x86 on Linux and macOS was released on 22 March 2004. Since then GDC has gained support for additional platforms, improved performance, and fixed bugs, while tracking upstream DMD code for the frontend and language specification.
* &quot;LDC&quot; – A compiler based on the DMD front-end that uses LLVM as its compiler back-end. The first release-quality version was published on 9 January 2009. It supports version 2.0.

Toy and proof-of-concept compilers:
* &quot;D Compiler for .NET&quot; – A back-end for the D programming language 2.0 compiler. It compiles the code to Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode rather than to machine code. The CIL can then be run via a Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) virtual machine. The project has not been updated in years and the author indicated the project is not active anymore.
* &quot;SDC&quot; – The &quot;Snazzy D Compiler&quot; uses a custom front-end and LLVM as its compiler back-end. It is written in D and uses a scheduler to handle symbol resolution in order to elegantly handle the compile-time features of D. This compiler currently supports a limited subset of the language.

Using above compilers and toolchains, it is possible to compile D programs to target many different architectures, including IA-32, amd64, AArch64, PowerPC, MIPS64, DEC Alpha, Motorola m68k, SPARC, s390, WebAssembly. The primary supported operating systems are Windows and Linux, but various compilers also support Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, AIX, Solaris/OpenSolaris and Android, either as a host or target, or both. WebAssembly target (supported via LDC and LLVM) can operate in any WebAssembly environment, like modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari), or dedicated Wasm virtual machines.

==Development tools==
Editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) supporting syntax highlighting and partial code completion for the language include SlickEdit, Emacs, vim, SciTE, Smultron, Zeus, and Geany among others.

* Dexed (formerly Coedit), a D focused graphical IDE written in Object Pascal
* Mono-D is a feature rich cross-platform D focused graphical IDE based on MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio, mainly written in C Sharp.
* Eclipse plug-ins for D include DDT and Descent (dead project).
* Visual Studio integration is provided by VisualD.
* Visual Studio Code integration with extensions as Dlang-Vscode or Code-D.
* A bundle is available for TextMate, and the IDE includes partial support for the language. However, standard IDE features such as code completion or refactoring are not yet available, though they do work partially in Code::Blocks (due to D&#x27;s similarity to C).
* The Xcode 3 plugin &quot;D for Xcode&quot; enables D-based projects and development.
* KDevelop (as well as its text editor backend, Kate) autocompletion plugin is available.
* Dlang IDE is a cross-platform IDE written in D using DlangUI library.

Open source D IDEs for Windows exist, some written in D, such as Poseidon, D-IDE, and Entice Designer.

D applications can be debugged using any C/C++ debugger, like GNU Debugger (GDB) or WinDbg, although support for various D-specific language features is extremely limited. On Windows, D programs can be debugged using Ddbg, or Microsoft debugging tools (WinDBG and Visual Studio), after having converted the debug information using cv2pdb. The ZeroBUGS debugger for Linux has experimental support for the D language. Ddbg can be used with various IDEs or from the command line; ZeroBUGS has its own graphical user interface (GUI).

&quot;DustMite&quot; is a tool for minimizing D source code, useful when finding compiler or tests issues.

&quot;dub&quot; is a popular package and build manager for D applications and libraries, and is often integrated into IDE support.

==Examples==
===Example 1===
This example program prints its command line arguments. The codice_35 function is the entry point of a D program, and codice_36 is an array of strings representing the command line arguments. A codice_37 in D is an array of characters, represented by codice_38.
import std.stdio: writefln;

void main(string[] args) {
 foreach (i, arg; args)
 writefln(&quot;args[%d] = &#x27;%s&#x27;&quot;, i, arg);


The codice_1 statement can iterate over any collection. In this case, it is producing a sequence of indexes (codice_40) and values (codice_41) from the array codice_36. The index codice_40 and the value codice_41 have their types inferred from the type of the array codice_36.

===Example 2===
The following shows several D capabilities and D design trade-offs in a short program. It iterates over the lines of a text file named codice_46, which contains a different word on each line, and prints all the words that are anagrams of other words.
import std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range, std.string;

void main() {
 dstring[] [dstring] signature2words;

 foreach (dchar[] w; lines(File(&quot;words.txt&quot;))) {
 w = w.chomp().toLower();
 immutable signature = w.dup.sort().release().idup;
 signature2words[signature] ~= w.idup;

 foreach (words; signature2words) {
 if (words.length &gt; 1)
 writeln(words.join(&quot; &quot;));
}

# codice_47 is a built-in associative array that maps dstring (32-bit / char) keys to arrays of dstrings. It is similar to codice_48 in Python.
# codice_49 yields lines lazily, with the newline. It has to then be copied with codice_50 to obtain a string to be used for the associative array values (the codice_50 property of arrays returns an immutable duplicate of the array, which is required since the codice_52 type is actually codice_53). Built-in associative arrays require immutable keys.
# The codice_54 operator appends a new dstring to the values of the associate dynamic array.
# codice_55, codice_56 and codice_57 are string functions that D allows the use of with a method syntax. The name of such functions are often similar to Python string methods. The codice_55 converts a string to lower case, codice_59 joins an array of strings into a single string using a single space as separator, and codice_57 removes a newline from the end of the string if one is present. The codice_61 is more readable, but equivalent to codice_62 for example. This feature is called UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax), and allows extending any built-in or third party package types with method-like functionality. The style of writing code like this is often referenced as pipeline (especially when the objects used are lazily computed, for example iterators / ranges) or Fluent interface.
# The codice_63 is an std.algorithm function that sorts the array in place, creating a unique signature for words that are anagrams of each other. The codice_64 method on the return value of codice_65 is handy to keep the code as a single expression.
# The second codice_1 iterates on the values of the associative array, it is able to infer the type of codice_67.
# codice_68 is assigned to an immutable variable, its type is inferred.
# UTF-32 codice_69 is used instead of normal UTF-8 codice_70 otherwise codice_65 refuses to sort it. There are more efficient ways to write this program using just UTF-8.

==Uses==
Notable organisations that use the D programming language for projects include Facebook, eBay, and Netflix.

D has been successfully used for AAA games, language interpreters, virtual machines, an operating system kernel, GPU programming, web development, numerical analysis, GUI applications, a passenger information system, machine learning, text processing, web and application servers and research.

The notorious North Korean hacking group known as Lazarus exploited CVE-2021-44228, aka &quot;Log4Shell,&quot; to deploy three malware families written in DLang.

==Critique==
The lack of transparency, agility and predictability in the process of getting corrections of known flaws and errors incorporated, and the difficulty of introducing minor and major changes to the D language, is imminently described in a blog post article by a former contributor. The apparent frustration described there has led to the &quot;OpenD&quot; fork on January 1, 2024.

<text>The line of succession to the Norwegian throne consists of people entitled to become head of state of Norway.

The succession is currently governed by Article 6 of the Constitution, altered most recently in 1990 to introduce absolute primogeniture among the grandchildren and further eligible descendants of King Harald V. The King&#x27;s children are ranked according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, which was given between 1971 and 1990; Crown Prince Haakon and his eligible descendants thus take precedence over his older sister, Princess Märtha Louise, and her eligible descendants.

Only legitimate descendants of the reigning monarch and the reigning monarch&#x27;s siblings and their legitimate descendants can be in line to the throne. However, the King&#x27;s elder sister, Princess Astrid and her descendants, along with descendants of the King&#x27;s deceased eldest sister, Princess Ragnhild, are excluded from the line of succession due to the agnatic primogeniture which was not given prior to 1971.

In the event that there is no-one in the line of succession, the Storting (Parliament) has the right to elect a successor under Article 7 (if the king is alive) or Article 48 (if the king has died).

Upon acceding to the throne (and being of age), the Norwegian monarch is required by Article 9 of the Constitution to take an oath before members of the Storting.

<doc id="243885" wikidata="Q322943" url="?curid=243885" title="Paris Peace Treaties, 1947">
<text>The Paris Peace Treaties () were signed on 10 February 1947 following the end of World War II in 1945. The Paris Peace Conference lasted from 29 July until 15 October 1946. The victorious wartime Allied powers (principally the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, United States, and France) negotiated the details of peace treaties with those former Axis allies, namely Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which had switched sides and declared war on Germany during the war. They were allowed to fully resume their responsibilities as sovereign states in international affairs and to qualify for membership in the United Nations.

The settlement elaborated in the peace treaties included payment of war reparations, commitment to minority rights, and territorial adjustments including the end of the Italian colonial empire in North Africa, East Africa, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania, as well as changes to the Italian–Yugoslav, Hungarian–Czechoslovak, Soviet–Romanian, Hungarian–Romanian, French–Italian, and Soviet–Finnish borders. The treaties also obliged the various states to hand over accused war criminals to the Allied powers for war crimes trials.

The Paris Peace Treaties avoided taking into consideration the consequences of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, whose secret clauses included the annexation of parts of Finland and Romania by the Soviet Union.

==Political clauses==
The political clauses stipulated that the signatory should &quot;take all measures necessary to secure to all persons under (its) jurisdiction, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, of political opinion and of public meeting.&quot;

No penalties were to be visited on nationals because of wartime partisanship for the Allies. Each government undertook measures to prevent the resurgence of fascist organizations or any others &quot;whether political, military or semi-military, whose purpose it is to deprive the people of their democratic rights&quot;.

==Border changes==
===Italy===

Italy lost the colonies of Italian Libya and Italian East Africa. The latter consisted of Italian Ethiopia, Italian Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. Italy continued to govern the former Italian Somaliland as a UN trust territory until 1960. In the peace treaty, Italy recognized the independence of Albania (in personal union with the Italian monarchy after the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939). Italy also lost its concession in Tianjin, which was turned over to China, and the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea were ceded to Greece.

Italy lost Istria: the provinces of Fiume, Zara, and most of Gorizia and Pola were ceded to Yugoslavia; the rest of Istria and the province of Trieste formed a new sovereign State (Free Territory of Trieste) divided in two administrative zones under a provisional government for which the United Nations Security Council was responsible. In 1954, Italy incorporated the Province of Trieste (Zone A) and Yugoslavia incorporated the rest of Istria (Zone B). This was officially recognized with the Treaty of Osimo in 1975.

The villages of the Tende valley and La Brigue were ceded to France but Italian diplomats were able to maintain in place the Treaty of Turin (1860), according to which the French-Italian alpine border passes through the summit of Mont Blanc, despite French designs on the Aosta Valley. The French Republic has never made provision for the Italian language in the ceded formerly Italian towns of Briga and Tenda, effectively opting for a policy of linguistic assimilation. The province of South Tyrol was also kept by Italy despite the territorial demands of Austria, largely thanks to the Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement signed some months before.

===Finland===

Finland was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941 (thus confirming its territorial losses after the Winter War of 1939–1940), except for the former province of Petsamo, which was ceded to the Soviet Union. In Finland, the reparations and the dictated border adjustment were perceived as a major injustice and a betrayal by the Western powers, after the sympathy Finland had received from the West during the Soviet-initiated Winter War. However, this sympathy had been eroded by Finland&#x27;s collaboration with Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1944. During this time, Finland not only recaptured territory it had lost in 1940, but continued its offensive deeper into Soviet lands, occupying a broad strip of Soviet territory. This prompted the United Kingdom to declare war on Finland in December 1941, further weakening political support in the West for the country. The Soviet Union&#x27;s accessions of Finnish territory was based on the Moscow Armistice signed in Moscow on 19 September 1944 and resulted in an extension of the accessions in the Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War.

===Hungary===
Hungary was restored to its borders before 1938. This meant restoring the southern border with Yugoslavia, as well as declaring the First and Second Vienna Awards null and void, cancelling Hungary&#x27;s gains from Czechoslovakia and Romania. Furthermore, three villages (namely Horvátjárfalu, Oroszvár, and Dunacsún) situated south of Bratislava were also transferred to Czechoslovakia, in order to form the so-called &quot;Bratislava bridgehead&quot;.

===Romania===
Romania was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941, but not to its borders before 23 August 1939, with the exception of the border with Hungary giving Northern Transylvania back to Romania. This confirmed the 1940 loss of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union and the Treaty of Craiova, which returned Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria.

===Bulgaria===
Bulgaria was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941, returning Vardar Macedonia to Yugoslavia and Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace to Greece, but keeping Southern Dobruja per the Treaty of Craiova, leaving Bulgaria as the only former Axis power to keep territory that was gained during the Second World War.

==War reparations==
The war reparation problem proved to be one of the most difficult arising from post-war conditions. The Soviet Union, the country most heavily ravaged by the war, felt entitled to the maximum amounts possible, with the exception of Bulgaria, which was perceived as being the most sympathetic of the former enemy states. (Bulgaria was part of the Axis but did not declare war on the Soviet Union). In the cases of Romania and Hungary, the reparation terms as set forth in their armistices were relatively high and were not revised.

War reparations at 1938 prices, in United States dollar amounts:
*$360,000,000 () from Italy:
**$125,000,000 () to Yugoslavia;
**$105,000,000 () to Greece;
**$100,000,000 () to the Soviet Union;
**$25,000,000 () to Ethiopia;
**$5,000,000 () to Albania.
*$300,000,000 () from Finland to the Soviet Union.
*$300,000,000 () from Hungary:
**$200,000,000 () to the Soviet Union;
**$100,000,000 () to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
*$300,000,000 () from Romania to the Soviet Union;
*$70,000,000 () from Bulgaria:
**$45,000,000 () to Greece;
**$25,000,000 () to Yugoslavia.

==Aftermath==
Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland all joined the United Nations on 14 December 1955.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s did not lead to any renegotiation of the Paris Peace Treaties. However, in 1990 Finland unilaterally cancelled the restrictions the treaty had placed on its military.

<text>The Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association, best known simply as the RSA, is one of the largest voluntary welfare organisations in New Zealand and one of the oldest ex-service organisations in the world.

Wounded soldiers returning from the Gallipoli Campaign founded the organisation in 1916, and it received royal patronage in 1920. The RNZRSA celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2016.

Poppy Day is usually observed on the Friday before ANZAC Day (25 April), New Zealand&#x27;s national day of commemoration.

Remembrance plays a special part in the life of the RSA. A moment of silence is generally observed daily at RSA club rooms in memory of comrades. On ANZAC Day and on other special anniversaries, local RSAs play a significant part in wreath-laying ceremonies of remembrance. As of 2014, 103,574 members supported a network of 180 local RSAs throughout New Zealand. RSA membership is open to everyone. The badge is still one of the most familiar icons in New Zealand.

<text>In mathematics, affine geometry is what remains of Euclidean geometry when ignoring (mathematicians often say &quot;forgetting&quot;) the metric notions of distance and angle.

As the notion of &quot;parallel lines&quot; is one of the main properties that is independent of any metric, affine geometry is often considered as the study of parallel lines. Therefore, Playfair&#x27;s axiom (Given a line and a point not on , there is exactly one line parallel to that passes through .) is fundamental in affine geometry. Comparisons of figures in affine geometry are made with affine transformations, which are mappings that preserve alignment of points and parallelism of lines.

Affine geometry can be developed in two ways that are essentially equivalent.

In synthetic geometry, an affine space is a set of &quot;points&quot; to which is associated a set of lines, which satisfy some axioms (such as Playfair&#x27;s axiom).

Affine geometry can also be developed on the basis of linear algebra. In this context an affine space is a set of &quot;points&quot; equipped with a set of &quot;transformations&quot; (that is bijective mappings), the translations, which forms a vector space (over a given field, commonly the real numbers), and such that for any given ordered pair of points there is a unique translation sending the first point to the second; the composition of two translations is their sum in the vector space of the translations.

In more concrete terms, this amounts to having an operation that associates to any ordered pair of points a vector and another operation that allows translation of a point by a vector to give another point; these operations are required to satisfy a number of axioms (notably that two successive translations have the effect of translation by the sum vector). By choosing any point as &quot;origin&quot;, the points are in one-to-one correspondence with the vectors, but there is no preferred choice for the origin; thus an affine space may be viewed as obtained from its associated vector space by &quot;forgetting&quot; the origin (zero vector).

The idea of forgetting the metric can be applied in the theory of manifolds. That is developed in the article on the affine connection.

==History==
In 1748, Leonhard Euler introduced the term &quot;affine&quot; () in his book (volume 2, chapter XVIII). In 1827, August Möbius wrote on affine geometry in his (chapter 3).

After Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen program, affine geometry was recognized as a generalization of Euclidean geometry.

In 1918, Hermann Weyl referred to affine geometry for his text &quot;Space, Time, Matter&quot;. He used affine geometry to introduce vector addition and subtraction at the earliest stages of his development of mathematical physics. Later, E. T. Whittaker wrote:
: Weyl&#x27;s geometry is interesting historically as having been the first of the affine geometries to be worked out in detail: it is based on a special type of parallel transport [...using] worldlines of light-signals in four-dimensional space-time. A short element of one of these world-lines may be called a &quot;null-vector&quot;; then the parallel transport in question is such that it carries any null-vector at one point into the position of a null-vector at a neighboring point.

==Systems of axioms==
Several axiomatic approaches to affine geometry have been put forward:

===Pappus&#x27; law===

As affine geometry deals with parallel lines, one of the properties of parallels noted by Pappus of Alexandria has been taken as a premise:
* Suppose are on one line and on another. If the lines and are parallel and the lines and are parallel, then the lines and are parallel. (This is the affine version of Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem).

The full axiom system proposed has &quot;point&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, and &quot;line containing point&quot; as primitive notions:
* Two points are contained in just one line.
* For any line and any point , not on , there is just one line containing and not containing any point of . This line is said to be &quot;parallel&quot; to .
* Every line contains at least two points.
* There are at least three points not belonging to one line.

According to H. S. M. Coxeter:
The interest of these five axioms is enhanced by the fact that they can be developed into a vast body of propositions, holding not only in Euclidean geometry but also in Minkowski&#x27;s geometry of time and space (in the simple case of 1 + 1 dimensions, whereas the special theory of relativity needs 1 + 3). The extension to either Euclidean or Minkowskian geometry is achieved by adding various further axioms of orthogonality, etc.

The various types of affine geometry correspond to what interpretation is taken for &quot;rotation&quot;. Euclidean geometry corresponds to the ordinary idea of rotation, while Minkowski&#x27;s geometry corresponds to hyperbolic rotation. With respect to perpendicular lines, they remain perpendicular when the plane is subjected to ordinary rotation. In the Minkowski geometry, lines that are hyperbolic-orthogonal remain in that relation when the plane is subjected to hyperbolic rotation.

===Ordered structure===
An axiomatic treatment of plane affine geometry can be built from the axioms of ordered geometry by the addition of two additional axioms:

# (Affine axiom of parallelism) Given a point and a line not through , there is at most one line through which does not meet .
# (Desargues) Given seven distinct points , such that are distinct lines through , and is parallel to , and is parallel to , then is parallel to .

The affine concept of parallelism forms an equivalence relation on lines. Since the axioms of ordered geometry as presented here include properties that imply the structure of the real numbers, those properties carry over here so that this is an axiomatization of affine geometry over the field of real numbers.

===Ternary rings===

The first non-Desarguesian plane was noted by David Hilbert in his &quot;Foundations of Geometry&quot;. The Moulton plane is a standard illustration. In order to provide a context for such geometry as well as those where Desargues theorem is valid, the concept of a ternary ring was developed by Marshall Hall.

In this approach affine planes are constructed from ordered pairs taken from a ternary ring. A plane is said to have the &quot;minor affine Desargues property&quot; when two triangles in parallel perspective, having two parallel sides, must also have the third sides parallel. If this property holds in the affine plane defined by a ternary ring, then there is an equivalence relation between &quot;vectors&quot; defined by pairs of points from the plane. Furthermore, the vectors form an abelian group under addition; the ternary ring is linear and satisfies right distributivity:
:formula_1

==Affine transformations==
Geometrically, affine transformations (affinities) preserve collinearity: so they transform parallel lines into parallel lines and preserve ratios of distances along parallel lines.

We identify as &quot;affine theorems&quot; any geometric result that is invariant under the affine group (in Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme this is its underlying group of symmetry transformations for affine geometry). Consider in a vector space , the general linear group . It is not the whole &quot;affine group&quot; because we must allow also translations by vectors in . (Such a translation maps any in to .) The affine group is generated by the general linear group and the translations and is in fact their semidirect product formula_2 (Here we think of as a group under its operation of addition, and use the defining representation of on to define the semidirect product.)

For example, the theorem from the plane geometry of triangles about the concurrence of the lines joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side (at the &quot;centroid&quot; or &quot;barycenter&quot;) depends on the notions of &quot;mid-point&quot; and &quot;centroid&quot; as affine invariants. Other examples include the theorems of Ceva and Menelaus.

Affine invariants can also assist calculations. For example, the lines that divide the area of a triangle into two equal halves form an envelope inside the triangle. The ratio of the area of the envelope to the area of the triangle is affine invariant, and so only needs to be calculated from a simple case such as a unit isosceles right angled triangle to give formula_3 i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%, for all triangles.

Familiar formulas such as half the base times the height for the area of a triangle, or a third the base times the height for the volume of a pyramid, are likewise affine invariants. While the latter is less obvious than the former for the general case, it is easily seen for the one-sixth of the unit cube formed by a face (area 1) and the midpoint of the cube (height 1/2). Hence it holds for all pyramids, even slanting ones whose apex is not directly above the center of the base, and those with base a parallelogram instead of a square. The formula further generalizes to pyramids whose base can be dissected into parallelograms, including cones by allowing infinitely many parallelograms (with due attention to convergence). The same approach shows that a four-dimensional pyramid has 4D hypervolume one quarter the 3D volume of its parallelepiped base times the height, and so on for higher dimensions.

=== Kinematics ===
Two types of affine transformation are used in kinematics, both classical and modern. Velocity is described using length and direction, where length is presumed unbounded. This variety of kinematics, styled as Galilean or Newtonian, uses coordinates of absolute space and time. The shear mapping of a plane with an axis for each represents coordinate change for an observer moving with velocity in a resting frame of reference.

Finite light speed, first noted by the delay in appearance of the moons of Jupiter, requires a modern kinematics. The method involves rapidity instead of velocity, and substitutes squeeze mapping for the shear mapping used earlier. This affine geometry was developed synthetically in 1912. to express the special theory of relativity.
In 1984, &quot;the affine plane associated to the Lorentzian vector space &quot;L&quot;2&quot; was described by Graciela Birman and Katsumi Nomizu in an article entitled &quot;Trigonometry in Lorentzian geometry&quot;.

==Affine space==
Affine geometry can be viewed as the geometry of an affine space of a given dimension &quot;n&quot;, coordinatized over a field &quot;K&quot;. There is also (in two dimensions) a combinatorial generalization of coordinatized affine space, as developed in synthetic finite geometry. In projective geometry, &quot;affine space&quot; means the complement of a hyperplane at infinity in a projective space. &quot;Affine space&quot; can also be viewed as a vector space whose operations are limited to those linear combinations whose coefficients sum to one, for example , , , , etc.

Synthetically, affine planes are 2-dimensional affine geometries defined in terms of the relations between points and lines (or sometimes, in higher dimensions, hyperplanes). Defining affine (and projective) geometries as configurations of points and lines (or hyperplanes) instead of using coordinates, one gets examples with no coordinate fields. A major property is that all such examples have dimension 2. Finite examples in dimension 2 (finite affine planes) have been valuable in the study of configurations in infinite affine spaces, in group theory, and in combinatorics.

Despite being less general than the configurational approach, the other approaches discussed have been very successful in illuminating the parts of geometry that are related to symmetry.

==Projective view==
In traditional geometry, affine geometry is considered to be a study between Euclidean geometry and projective geometry. On the one hand, affine geometry is Euclidean geometry with congruence left out; on the other hand, affine geometry may be obtained from projective geometry by the designation of a particular line or plane to represent the points at infinity. In affine geometry, there is no metric structure but the parallel postulate does hold. Affine geometry provides the basis for Euclidean structure when perpendicular lines are defined, or the basis for Minkowski geometry through the notion of hyperbolic orthogonality. In this viewpoint, an affine transformation is a projective transformation that does not permute finite points with points at infinity, and affine transformation geometry is the study of geometrical properties through the action of the group of affine transformations.

<text>Dinghy sailing is the activity of sailing small boats by using five essential controls:
* The sails
* The foils (i.e. the daggerboard or centreboard and rudder and sometimes lifting foils as found on the Moth)
* The trim (forward/rear angle of the boat in the water)
* Side-to-side balance of the dinghy by hiking or movement of the crew, particularly in windy weather (&quot;move fast or swim&quot;)
* The choice of route (in terms of existing and anticipated wind shifts, possible obstacles, other water traffic, currents, tides etc.)
When racing, the above skills need to be refined and additional skills and techniques learned, such as the application of the &quot;racing rules of sailing&quot;, boat handling skills when starting and when rounding marks, and knowledge of tactics and strategy. Racing tactics include positioning the boat at different angles. To improve speed when racing, sailors should position themselves at the windward direction (closest to the direction of the wind) in order to get &quot;clean air&quot;.

The RYA, the regulating authority for sail training in the UK, states that, &quot;With a reliance on nature and the elements, sailing ... is about adventure, exploration, teamwork and fun.&quot;

==Development of the dinghy==

=== Early beginnings ===
There has always been a need for small tender boats for transporting goods and personnel to and from anchored sailing ships. Together with other smaller work craft such as fishing and light cargo, small inshore craft have always been in evidence. Charles II of England had a private sailing boat presented to him when he returned from exile to England in the 17th century, and he sailed for recreation and competition.

In 1887 Thomas Middleton, a Dublin solicitor, considered that yacht racing was becoming an excessively expensive activity, with boats becoming eclipsed by better designs each year. He proposed the &#x27;One Model&#x27; principle. He wanted yacht racing to be an exercise of skill with all boats being built to the same design. He assembled a group of potential owners who agreed to call the boat &#x27;The Water Wag&#x27;. The Water Wag Club still prospers in Dún Laoghaire harbour, with racing each Wednesday evening during the Summer season.

Towards the end of the 19th century people began to use these small boats for sport and recreational sailing, utilising the opportunities for leisure afforded by the Industrial Revolution. Larger privately used sailing boats had developed separately, and have resulted in the yachts of today. There has been some crossover, in that the sloop sail plan was adopted as standard and most convenient by early dinghy designers.

===Planing and trapezing===

The development of the sailing dinghy was helped in the early 20th century by Uffa Fox (1898–1972), an English boat designer and sailing enthusiast. He developed and contributed to many dinghy classes that are still with us nearly a century later: the Albacore, International 14, National 12, Jet 14, Firefly and Flying Fifteen. The Scorpion was designed in 1959 by Taprell Dorling.

He also introduced the major advance of hull shapes that can plane, and which can therefore reach beyond the usual speed limits for small sailing boats. In effect, a boat which is planing is skimming along the surface, with the bow of the boat not in the water. This results in less friction because of reduced waterline length, reduced displacement (the amount of water needing to be pushed aside by the boat), and reduced &#x27;wetted area&#x27;. The driving force provided by the sails has to overcome less resistance, and therefore speed increases dramatically.

In 1928 Uffa Fox introduced planing to the English dinghy racing world in his International 14 boat, the &quot;Avenger&quot;. He achieved 52 first places, two second places and three third places out of 57 race starts that year. Note: Graham Anderson in his 1999 book &quot;Fast Light Boats, a Century of Kiwi Innovation&quot; argues that planing centreboard sailing boats were introduced into New Zealand in the early 20th century – well before Uffa Fox popularised the concept.

Another advance in dinghy sailing was introduced in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced; doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the &#x27;hounds&#x27; or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also be very dangerous if the crew is not wearing a quick-release harness or is inexperienced. The quick-release harness allows the crew to unstrap themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize.

Trapezing during a race first appeared in 1934, on the Amazon A Class Rater.

Uffa Fox started building 14s in 1923, and was designing them by 1925. He was to transform the class with the introduction of his first planing hull design, Avenger, in 1927. The construction and finish of his 14s was considered by many to be the ultimate in quality and craftsmanship, and Thunder and Lightning built in 1938 was no exception.

The hull was built of two thin veneers; diagonal internally and fore and aft externally, and stiffened by tiny rock elm frames, all fastened with thousands of copper nails. His aim was to achieve as light a construction as possible using the materials of the day – there was no carbon fibre or Kevlar then.

Within a week of being launched, Thunder &amp; Lightning won one of yachting&#x27;s premier racing trophies, the Prince of Wales Cup, held that year at Falmouth. It was during this series that the boat&#x27;s owners, Peter Scott (son of the famous Scott of the Antarctic), and John Winter, used a device now commonly known as the trapeze. At that time, it was known as King George&#x27;s Jubilee Truss. The device was immediately banned by the Yacht Racing Committee on the grounds that it was unsporting and gave an unfair advantage to its users. Thunder &amp; Lightning is now in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.

The innovative technique was immediately banned, and received little development until it was reintroduced on the Osprey and Fiveohfive Class (505) in 1954 by John Westell and the Flying Dutchman class in the early 1960s.

===Post WWII developments===
During the Second World War plywood had become a major building material for aircraft. After the war, plywood was adapted for building sailing dinghies. Two primary methods of construction were adopted: stitch and glue and timber-framed construction. Jack Holt designed many dinghies to be built by home handymen using these construction techniques. The Mirror Dinghy was predominantly built using stitch and glue, while the Enterprise and Heron is an example of a boat built using plywood on a timber frame.

===Modern developments===

At the beginning of the 21st century, dinghy sailing is still a rapidly developing sport. It is losing its image of being expensive, time-consuming, and exclusive. This is because of the earlier work of pioneers such as Uffa Fox, and through the use of modern designs and techniques such as lighter hull materials (e.g., fibreglass and foam sandwich hull construction, which eliminate time-consuming maintenance and constant care that wooden hulls required, although they are rare and only a few people make them some still sail with wooden boats), more responsive sail materials and design, easily transportable boats (many car-toppable), and simpler rigs such as gennakers instead of more complex spinnakers. These advances are more economical in time and money, and have greatly extended the appeal of dinghy sailing.

In Britain, the RYA regulates racing and provides modular and accredited training courses for leisure and competitive sailing. A basic sailing course can be completed in several days. Similar organisations exist worldwide to administer and promote both leisure and competitive sailing.

==Types of dinghies==

Some dinghies come into more than one category, either because boundaries overlap or because different categories are measuring different things; e.g. both &quot;one design&quot; boats and boats of much freer design can be found in each of the main categories below.

Dinghy designs are often referred to as &quot;classes&quot;; these classes are usually categorised as one design, open, or restricted. A more formal term for open is &quot;Development Class&quot;. One design dinghies are supposed to be identical, though in reality this is not always the case. Only the most restrictive one design classes will restrict individual fittings. Then there becomes a sliding scale of allowable modification or design differences; restricted classes would typically allow the movement of fittings or even parts of the boat around, but are unlikely to allow major changes to hull shape or sails. Truly open development classes are also almost unknown, the famous line about the 18 ft skiff &quot;the boat shall be 18ft long and the race starts at 2 o&#x27;clock&quot; is a myth but open classes will usually allow pretty radical changes within usually some kind of box rule which specifies depth, length, width of hull height of mast and sometimes a minimum weight and sail area.

Classes which are not development classes are usually referred to as &quot;One design&quot;. The idea is that One Designs provide a fair and level playing field for even competition, whereas Development Classes drive boat speed and technology forwards. The first one design was the Water Wag designed by Thomas Middleton, which first sailed in Dublin Bay in 1887. The class is still sailed today, well over a hundred years later. The first International one-design class was the B.R.A. 12 foot dinghy which was designed by George Cockshott in 1914 for West Kirby marine lake. This design expanded to Holland, Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland etc. and further afield.

All of the following classes can be used for recreational as well as racing purposes. Some function better for recreation use because they require less maintenance and can be left on a mooring, while other (usually racing) boats can&#x27;t be left on mooring because they will capsize, which can cause certain parts like the mast and hull to be damaged.

Sailing skiffs are the fastest and arguably most difficult type of dinghy to sail. A skiff has a flat narrow hull with a disproportionately large sailplan, usually consisting of an asymmetric spinnaker, blade jib and fully battened main. Sailors manage the rig with the use of racks (wings) and trapeze. Examples are the 49er, an Olympic boat, 18 Footers (see below) and the advanced International 14.

High-performance dinghies are fast and powerful dinghies designed for racing around an Olympic triangle (Olympic Racing Course). Examples of such dinghies are the International Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the 14 ft John Spencer Javelin and the International 470. They can all plane easily, even upwind and they use trapeze and a symmetric spinnaker. Not all are two handed boats: the International Contender and the RS600 are high performance single handed boats equipped with a trapeze, but not a spinnaker, and demonstrate a comparable performance. Skiffs are usually classed as High performance dinghies.

Racing dinghies are designed for racing, but not all have necessarily the same calibre of performance as the above. However, in many cases they can still offer equally close competition, at the very highest standards, which for many racing helmsmen and crews is the most important consideration. They cover a wide range, and many are descended from Uffa Fox&#x27;s seminal International 14. People often &quot;travel&quot; with their dinghies to international races in famous sailing spots such as Lake Garda in Italy. The Snipe International Class still stands as one of the strongest classes, after reaching the status of world&#x27;s largest fleet of dinghies in July 1936. Other examples include the GP14, Enterprise, Scorpion, Solo, Graduate, Firefly, Lark. A specialized subgroup is the Scow, which typically uses two bilgeboards instead of a centerboard, and may have two rudders. Many racing dinghies require two or more people to sail the boat, the skipper is in charge or steering and the main sail depending on the boat, and the crew is in charge of the jib, the spinnaker, (which can only be flown while going downwind) and keeping the boat level

Cruising dinghies are designed for leisure and family sailing and are usually more stable than high-performance dinghies. This is provided by a &#x27;chined&#x27; (less rounded) hull, greater displacement, and proportionally smaller sail area. Some are specifically designed for longer passage-making, and/or for camping aboard. Examples of these include the Wayfarer, arguably the GP14, the Tideway, the Laser Stratos, the Drascombe series of dinghies, the CL 16 and the Laser 16, the Roamer Cruising Dinghy, designed by Eric Coleman an early member of the Dinghy Cruising Association, plus many designs of Iain Oughtred, John Welsford and François Vivier. Sailing these boats can still give much excitement.

Cruiser-racer dinghies successfully combine elements of both the immediately previous two groups, offering good racing performance and also being very viable cruising boats. Arguably the only two world-class cruiser-racer dinghies, in terms of both the extensive availability of top class racing and their suitability for serious cruising, are the Wayfarer and the GP14; of these the Wayfarer has the edge for cruising, once on the water, in part because she is the larger boat, while the GP14 has the edge for racing. However the Mirror and her larger sisters, and the Heron, can also be regarded as coming into this category.

Classic dinghies are typically used as yacht tenders or shore boats, and emphasize beauty and versatility over sailing performance. Although some are still made entirely from wood, the majority of the most popular classic sailing dinghies combine a fiberglass hull with enough finely finished teak or mahogany to represent the &quot;best of two worlds&quot; approach. The fiberglass hull makes the boat maintenance easier and some think they are sturdier and will not corrode like wood. Examples of classic sailing dinghies are Minto, Mirror Dinghy, Fatty Knees, Trinka, Bauer, Whitehall, and Gig Harbor.

Safety dinghies were designed to be used as yacht tenders with the added function of proactive self-rescue boat that can be sailed to safety. These boats are also used as recreational sailboats. Some of them can be fitted out with exposure canopies, sea anchors, and other survival gear. Examples of safety dinghies are the Portland Pudgy dinghy and the Clam dinghy.

Multihulls are fast twin or three hulled boats that fall under the definition of dinghy. Unlike dinghies, multihulls have high aspect ratio rigs with fully battened mainsails and sometimes, a rotating mast. This allows the rig to be highly aerodynamic and the reduced drag from the thin hulls, gives a multihull its great speed advantage over traditional monohulls. Dinghy-sized multihulls are sometimes referred to as &quot;Beach Catamarans or Beach Trimarans&quot;.

The International 14 remains a popular racing class, having acquired racks (for trapezing crews) and a gennaker since its original design. The Laser Standard, Laser Radial and Laser 4.7 are the variants of the Laser dinghy, a single-hander whose combination of simplicity, portability and performance has done much to advance dinghy racing and training. More modern dinghies like the Phil Morrison designed RS200, RS400, RS800 and RS Vareo Dinghies, the Musto Skiff, Splash and RS600 have also increased dinghy sailing participation around the UK. Two popular dinghies used in high school and college racing are the 420 and Flying Junior.

Sports boats: These classes are larger off-shore racing dinghies which shade off into classes of yachts with fixed keels. Usually they have several crew members as well as the helm. Melges 24 and Laser SB3 are current examples of this type.

Development classes: Most dinghy classes have a fairly fixed layout of sails and hull design, and changes are very infrequent. However, some classes can compete and sail with less rigid definitions and measurements. This encourages experiment which often leads to innovation in techniques and construction. Examples are the International 14, National 12, the 18ft Skiff, the Puddle Duck Racer and the Moth. The International Moth is worth noting because of its use of lifting foils on the rudder and daggerboard. These generate enough lift to push the hull above the water, significantly reducing friction and allowing speeds in excess of .

==Dinghy racing==
Racing is one of the most popular forms of dinghy sailing, and it contributes to the development of sailing skills as well as to improvements in dinghy and sail construction and design. Sometimes the Olympic triangle is used as a course for dinghy races where space permits, particularly for events where there ought to be little local advantage such as State and National titles and for classes which are mainly displacement sailing such as the Heron (dinghy). The olympic triangle is the most popular choice for dinghy racing, but a windward leeward course is another popular option.

<text>The [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic City]] of Stendal () is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is the capital of the Stendal District and the unofficial capital of the Altmark region.

==Geography==

Situated west of the Elbe valley, the Stendal town centre is located some west of Berlin, around east of Hanover, and north of the state capital Magdeburg. Stendal is the seat of a University of Applied Sciences () and preserves a picturesque old town including a historic market and several churches. The nearby village Uchtspringe is home to a psychiatric rehabilitation clinic.

=== Divisions ===
The town Stendal consists of Stendal proper and the following 18 &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Bindfelde
*Borstel
*Buchholz
*Dahlen
*Groß Schwechten
*Heeren
*Insel
*Jarchau
*Möringen
*Nahrstedt
*Staats
*Staffelde
*Uchtspringe
*Uenglingen
*Vinzelberg
*Volgfelde
*Wahrburg
*Wittenmoor
==History==
A settlement named &quot;Steinedal&quot; in the Eastphalian &quot;Balsamgau&quot; of Saxony, then a possession of Saint Michael’s Abbey in Hildesheim, was mentioned in a deed allegedly issued by Emperor Henry II in 1022. However, the entry has proven to be a 12th-century forgery, as the original document contained no such record. The fortified town near the Elbe crossing at Tangermünde was actually founded and granted Magdeburg rights by the first Brandenburg margrave Albert the Bear about 1160.

The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s was first mentioned in 1283. Stendal quickly prospered as a centre of commerce and trade; it received city walls about 1300, the citizens joined the Hanseatic League in 1358 and purchased the privilege of minting from the Brandenburg margraves in 1369. A Latin school is documented from 1338. In 1456 the Hohenzollern elector Frederick II Irontooth founded a convent of Augustinian nuns, which today is the site of a museum. In 1502 his descendant Elector Joachim I Nestor married Princess Elizabeth of Denmark at Stendal. Several churches, the town hall and the two remaining city gates show Stendal&#x27;s wealth in the period.

The Stendal citizens turned Protestant in 1539, with the reformator Konrad Cordatus serving as superintendent. For centuries part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, Stendal with the Altmark region passed to the Prussian Province of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars. A Prussian garrison town since the 17th century, it hosted the 10th (Magdeburg) Hussars regiment from 1884.

Stendal was the site of a Luftwaffe airfield in World War II, which had been the site of the first German &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; training school from 1936; the boxer Max Schmeling was trained as a paratrooper here in 1940/41. The town suffered from strategic bombing. Stendal was hit by 10 air raids, and more than 300 civilians died when Röxe, a residential area in the southern part of the town, was devastated by bombs. The Cathedral and various historical buildings were heavily damaged by bombs. In April 1945, the aerodrome served as starting place of the &quot;Sonderkommando Elbe&quot; unit, only a few days before the local authorities surrendered to the US Army. On May 4, the commander of the Wehrmacht 12th Army, General Maximilian von Edelsheim, signed the capitulation document at the Stendal town hall. In July 1945, Stendal was handed over to Soviet occupation.

From 1949 until German reunification in 1990, the town belonged to East Germany, part of Bezirk Magdeburg from 1952. Until 1994, the Stendal barracks served as home base for a riflemen division of the Soviet 2nd Guards Tank Army. In 1974 the construction of the Stendal Nuclear Power Plant was begun north of the town, but abandoned after reunification. In 2009 the Stendal citizens voted for the prefix &quot;Hansestadt&quot; (&quot;Hanseatic City&quot;).

On 1 January 2010, the town Stendal absorbed the former municipalities Buchholz, Groß Schwechten, Heeren, Möringen, Nahrstedt, Staats, Uchtspringe, Uenglingen, Volgfelde, and Wittenmoor. On 29 April 2010, it absorbed Vinzelberg, and on 1 September 2010 Dahlen and Insel.

==Education==
The Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences was founded in 1991 and has around 50 study programmes taught at three departments in Magdeburg and two departments in Stendal. There are approximately 130 professors with around 3,700 students in Magdeburg and 1,800 in Stendal.

==Main sights==
There are various well-preserved historical buildings in Stendal, e.g., the &quot;Tangemünde Gate&quot;, a medieval city gate dating from 1220 and &quot;Uenglinger Gate&quot; built in the 15th century. The Powder Tower (&quot;Pulverturm&quot;) which was built around 1450 is a former defence tower of the medieval city wall. St. Nicholas Church was built in 1423-1467 and heavily damaged by bombs in 1945. Reconstruction was started in 1946, interrupted several times and completed in 2013. The City Hall in the Market Place where a statue of Roland can be seen was built in the 14th century. &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Church&quot; with its two towers measuring 84 metres in height was inaugurated in 1447, and its altar dates from 1471. &quot;St. Jakobi Church&quot; in the northern part of the historical centre was built 1311-1477. &quot;St. Petri Church&quot; built at the end of the 13th century is the oldest church in Stendal. &quot;Breite Straße&quot; with many well-preserved medieval houses is the main street of the old city centre.

===Theatre of the Altmark===
The area has a theatre named Theater der Altmark. It was founded in 1946 and has always had a particular involvement in youth and children&#x27;s theatre. Theatrical performances and dance events are staged, as well as concerts, conferences and meetings.

===Winckelmann Museum===
The Winckelmann Museum is named after Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the founder of classical archaeology. Its holdings include biographical documents, works, designs and diagrams as well as Greek sculptures or casts, along with other small artworks from antiquity. Since summer 2003 the museum has been the owner of the world&#x27;s biggest Trojan horse. With its size of 15.60 m high, 13 m long, 9.50 m wide and its weight of 45 tons it offers a beautiful view over Stendal. Exhibitions are held relating to archaeology and the history of art from the 18th and 19th centuries; there is also a modern art museum. The museum is the seat of the Winckelmann-Gesellschaft (the Winckelmann Society). In addition, the museum has exhibits relating to the history and cultural history of the city of Stendal and of the Altmark dating from the prehistoric period through the area&#x27;s early history right up to the present. There are exhibits pertaining to the Hanseatic League, Romanesque art and local archaeological material.

===Fire Brigade Museum===
The town also has the &quot;Landesfeuerwehrmuseum&quot; (&quot;Fire Brigade Museum&quot;), showing the development of fire fighting and protection from the leather bucket to modern fire engines.

===Other===

Stendal is also part of the Altmark cycle path. Information and maps about this cycle path can be had for free from the tourist information office.

==Transportation==
Stendal station is the most important interchange and rail hub in the north of Saxony-Anhalt. Located on the Berlin–Lehrte railway and the parallel Hanover–Berlin high-speed railway line, it is regularly served by Intercity and Intercity-Express (ICE) trains. Many ICE trains stop in Stendal. Berlin can be reached within 40 minutes and Hanover within 50 minutes.

A direct connection to the German Autobahn network is planned with the extension of the BAB 14 from Magdeburg to Schwerin.

<text>Menkaure or Menkaura (; 2550 BC - 2503 BC) was a king of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He is well known under his Hellenized names Mykerinos ( by Herodotus), in turn Latinized as Mycerinus, and Menkheres ( by Manetho). According to Manetho, he was the throne successor of king Bikheris, but according to archaeological evidence, he was almost certainly the successor of Khafre. Africanus (from Syncellus) reports as rulers of the fourth dynasty Sôris, Suphis I, Suphis II, Mencherês (=Menkaure), Ratoisês, Bicheris, Sebercherês, and Thamphthis in this order. Menkaure became famous for his tomb, the Pyramid of Menkaure, at Giza and his statue triads, which showed him alongside the goddess Hathor and various regional deities.

==Family==

Menkaure was the son of Khafre and the grandson of Khufu. A flint knife found in the mortuary temple of Menkaure mentioned a king&#x27;s mother Khamerernebty I, suggesting that Khafre and this queen were the parents of Menkaure. Menkaure is thought to have had at least two wives.
* Queen Khamerernebty II is the daughter of Khamerernebty I and the mother of a king&#x27;s son Khuenre. The location of Khuenre&#x27;s tomb suggests that he was a son of Menkaure, making his mother the wife of this king.
* Queen Rekhetre is known to have been a daughter of Khafre and as such the most likely identity of her husband is Menkaure.

Not many children are attested for Menkaure:
* Khuenre was the son of queen Khamerernebty II. Menkaure was not succeeded by Prince Khuenre, his eldest son, who predeceased Menkaure, but rather by Shepseskaf, a younger son of this king.
* Shepseskaf was the successor to Menkaure and likely his son.
* Sekhemre is known from a statue and possibly a son of Menkaure.
* A daughter who died in early adulthood is mentioned by Herodotus. She was placed at a decorated hall of the palatial area at Sais, in a hollow gold layered wooden zoomorphic burial feature in the shape of a kneeling cow covered externally with a layer of red decoration except the neck area and the horns that were covered with adequate layers of gold.
*Khentkaus I – possible Menkaure&#x27;s daughter

The royal court included several of Menkaure&#x27;s half brothers. His brothers Nebemakhet, Duaenre, Nikaure, and Iunmin served as viziers during the reign of their brother. His brother Sekhemkare may have been younger than he was and became vizier after the death of Menkaure.

== Reign ==

The length of Menkaure&#x27;s reign is uncertain. The ancient historian Manetho credits him with a reign of 63 years, but this is surely an exaggeration. The Turin King List is damaged at the spot where it should present the full sum of years, but the remains allow a reconstruction of &quot;..?.. + 8  years of rulership&quot;. Egyptologists think that 18-year reign was meant to be written, which is generally accepted. A contemporary workmen&#x27;s graffito reports about the &quot;year after the 11th cattle count&quot;. If the cattle count was held every second year (as was tradition at least up to king Sneferu), Menkaure might have ruled for 22 years.

In 2013, a fragment of the sphinx of Menkaure was discovered at Tel Hazor at the entrance to the city palace.

==Pyramid complex==

Menkaure&#x27;s pyramid at Giza was called &quot;Netjer-er-Menkaure&quot;, meaning &quot;Menkaure is Divine&quot;. This pyramid is the smallest of the three main pyramids at Giza. This pyramid measures at the base and in height. There are three subsidiary pyramids associated with Menkaure&#x27;s pyramid. 

These other pyramids are sometimes labeled G-IIIa (East subsidiary pyramid), G-IIIb (Middle subsidiary pyramid) and G-IIIc (West subsidiary pyramid). In the chapel associated with G-IIIa a statue of a queen was found. It is possible that these pyramids were meant for the queens of Khafre. It may be that Khamerernebti II was buried in one of the pyramids.

===Valley temple===
The Valley temple was a mainly brick built structure that was enlarged in the fifth or sixth Dynasty. From this temple come the famous statues of Menkaure with his queen and Menkaure with several deities. A partial list includes:
* Nome triad, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore seated, and King and Hare-nome goddess standing, greywacke, in Boston Mus. 09.200.
* Nome triad, King, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore and Theban nome-god standing, greywacke. (Now in Cairo Mus. Ent. 40678.)
* Nome triad, King, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore and Jackal-nome goddess standing, greywacke. (Now in Cairo Mus. Ent. 40679.)
* Nome triad, King, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore and Bat-fetish nome -goddess standing, greywacke. (Now in Cairo Mus. Ent. 46499.)
* Nome triad, King, Hathor, and nome-god standing, greywacke. (Middle part in Boston Mus. 11.3147, head of King in Brussels, Mus. Roy. E. 3074.)
* Double-statue,’ King and wife (Khamerernebti II) standing, uninscribed, greywacke. (Now in Boston Mus. 11.1738.)
* King seated, life-size, fragmentary, alabaster. (Now in Cairo Mus. Ent. 40703.)
* King seated, lower part, inscribed seat, alabaster. (Now in Boston Mus. 09.202)

===Mortuary Temple===
At his mortuary temple more statues and statue fragments were found. An interesting find is a fragment of a wand from Queen Khamerernebty I. The piece is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Khamerernebti is given the title King&#x27;s Mother on the fragment.

===Sarcophagus===

In 1837, English army officer Richard William Howard Vyse, and engineer John Shae Perring began excavations within the pyramid of Menkaure. In the main burial chamber of the pyramid they found a large stone sarcophagus long, in width, and in height, made of basalt. The sarcophagus was not inscribed with hieroglyphs although it was decorated in the style of palace facade. Adjacent to the burial chamber were found wooden fragments of a coffin bearing the name of Menkaure and a partial skeleton wrapped in a coarse cloth. The sarcophagus was removed from the pyramid and was sent by ship to the British Museum in London, but the merchant ship &quot;Beatrice&quot; carrying it was lost after leaving port at Malta on October 13, 1838. The other materials were sent by a separate ship, and those materials now reside at the museum, with the remains of the wooden coffin case on display.

It is now thought that the coffin was a replacement made during the much later Saite period, nearly two millennia after the king&#x27;s original interment. Radio carbon dating of the bone fragments that were found, place them at an even later date, from the Coptic period in the first centuries AD.

==Records from later periods==
According to Herodotus (430 BC), Menkaure was the son of Khufu (Greek &quot;Cheops&quot;), and that he alleviated the suffering his father&#x27;s reign had caused the inhabitants of ancient Egypt. Herodotus adds that he suffered much misfortune: his only daughter, whose corpse was interred in a wooden bull (which Herodotus claims survived to his lifetime), died before him. Subsequently the oracle at Buto predicted he would only rule six more years.
==In popular culture==
* Menkaure was the subject of a poem by the nineteenth century English poet Matthew Arnold, entitled &quot;Mycerinus&quot;.
* Menkaure, using the Greek version of his name, Mencheres, is a major character in the &quot;Night Huntress&quot; series of books by Jeaniene Frost, depicted as an extremely old and powerful vampire living in modern times. He is a protagonist of one book in the series.

<text>Günter Blobel (; May 21, 1936 – February 18, 2018) was a Silesian German and American biologist and 1999 Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology for the discovery that proteins have intrinsic signals that govern their transport and localization in the cell.

==Biography==
Günter Blobel was born in Waltersdorf in the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia, then located in eastern Germany. In January 1945 his family fled from native Silesia to Dresden to escape from the advancing Red Army. During the bombing of Dresden, Blobel, then 8, stayed with his family at a relative&#x27;s farm to the west of the city. After the war, Blobel grew up and attended gymnasium in the Saxon town of Freiberg. He studied medicine and graduated from the University of Tübingen in 1960. After two years service in a medical internship, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, following an older brother, enrolling in the University of Wisconsin–Madison and, joining the lab of Van R. Potter for his graduate work. Blobel matriculated in 1967 with a Ph.D. He then moved to Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral fellow with George Palade, and was soon appointed as a professor.

Blobel was appointed to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1986. Blobel was the sole recipient of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of signal peptides. Signal peptides form an integral part of protein targeting, a mechanism for cells to direct newly synthesized protein molecules to their proper location by means of an &quot;address tag&quot; (i.e., a signal peptide) within the molecule.

Blobel died of cancer in Manhattan at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center on February 18, 2018 at the age of 81. By the time of his death, Blobel was described as having &quot;ushered cell biology into the molecular age&quot; through his work on the fractionation and reconstitution of functional protein complexes and sub-cellular components &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Blobel became well known for his direct and active support for the rebuilding of Dresden in Germany, becoming, in 1994, the founder and president of the nonprofit &quot;Friends of Dresden, Inc.&quot; He donated all of the Nobel award money to the restoration of Dresden, in particular for the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche (completed in 2005) and the building of a new synagogue. In Leipzig he pursued a rebuilding of the Paulinerkirche, the university church of the University of Leipzig, which had been blown up by the communist regime of East Germany in 1968, arguing &quot;this is a shrine of German cultural history, connected to the most important names in German cultural history.&quot; Gunter was also a founding member of the board of directors of Research Foundation to Cure AIDS, a U.S. not-for-profit research organization.

==Personal life==
Blobel lost his older sister to aerial bombing of a train she was on in 1945, shortly after the bombing of Dresden, while an older brother survived the war and became a veterinarian in the United States. Blobel worked at the Rockefeller University in New York City from 1968. He lived in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side with his wife, Laura Maioglio (owner of Barbetta). He was on the board of directors for Nestlé and the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Furthermore, he was Co-Founder and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board for Chromocell Corporation. He sat on the Selection Committee for Life Science and Medicine which chooses winners of the Shaw Prize. Blobel had a passion for opera and architecture, in addition to his passion for experimental science.

<text>The Galton board, also known as the Galton box or [[quincunx]] or bean machine (or incorrectly Dalton board), is a device invented by Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution.

Galton designed it to illustrate his idea of regression to the mean, which he called &quot;reversion to mediocrity&quot; and made part of his eugenist ideology.

==Description==
The Galton board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs. Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs. Eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom, where the height of bead columns accumulated in the bins approximate a bell curve. Overlaying Pascal&#x27;s triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin.

Large-scale working models of this device created by Charles and Ray Eames can be seen in the &quot;&quot; exhibits permanently on view at the Boston Museum of Science, the New York Hall of Science, or the Henry Ford Museum. The Ford Museum machine was displayed at the IBM Pavilion during 1964-65 New York World&#x27;s Fair, later appearing at Pacific Science Center in Seattle. Another large-scale version is displayed in the lobby of Index Fund Advisors in Irvine, California.

Boards can be constructed for other distributions by changing the shape of the pins or biasing them towards one direction, and even bimodal boards are possible. A board for the log-normal distribution (common in many natural processes, particularly biological ones), which uses isosceles triangles of varying widths to &#x27;multiply&#x27; the distance the bead travels instead of fixed sizes steps which would &#x27;sum&#x27;, was constructed by Jacobus Kapteyn while studying and popularizing the statistics of the log-normal in order to help visualize it and demonstrate its plausibility. As of 1963, it was preserved in the University of Groningen. There is also an improved log-normal machine that uses skewed triangles whose right sides are longer, and thus avoiding shifting the median of the beads to the left.

==Distribution of the beads==

If a bead bounces to the right &quot;k&quot; times on its way down (and to the left on the remaining pegs) it ends up in the &quot;k&quot;th bin counting from the left. Denoting the number of rows of pegs in a Galton Board by &quot;n&quot;, the number of paths to the &quot;k&quot;th bin on the bottom is given by the binomial coefficient formula_1. Note that the leftmost bin is the &quot;0&quot;-bin, next to it is the &quot;1&quot;-bin, etc. and the furthest one to the right is the &quot;n&quot;-bin - making thus the total number of bins equal to &quot;n+1&quot; (each row does not need to have more pegs than the number that identifies the row itself, e.g. the first row has 1 peg, the second 2 pegs, until the &quot;n&quot;-th row that has &quot;n&quot; pegs which correspond to the &quot;n+1&quot; bins). If the probability of bouncing right on a peg is &quot;p&quot; (which equals 0.5 on an unbiased level machine) the probability that the ball ends up in the &quot;k&quot;th bin equals formula_2. This is the probability mass function of a binomial distribution. The number of rows correspond to the size of a binomial distribution in number of trials, while the probability &quot;p&quot; of each pin is the binomial&#x27;s &quot;p&quot;.

According to the central limit theorem (more specifically, the de Moivre–Laplace theorem), the binomial distribution approximates the normal distribution provided that the number of rows and the number of balls are both large. Varying the rows will result in different standard deviations or widths of the bell-shaped curve or the normal distribution in the bins.

Another interpretation more accurate from the physical view is given by the Entropy: since the energy that is carried by every falling bead is finite, so even that on any tip their collisions are chaotic because the derivative is undefined (there is no way to previously figure out for which side is going to fall), the mean and variance of each bean is restricted to be finite (they will never bound out of the box), and the Gaussian shape arises because it is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a continuous process with defined mean and variance. The rise of the normal distribution could be interpreted as that all possible information carried by each bean related to which path it has travelled has been already completely lost through their downhill collisions.

== Examples ==
==History==
Francis Galton designed his board as part of a presentation for the Royal Institution Discourses on February 27, 1874. His goal was to promote the use of ranking instead of measurement in statistics, so that qualities such as intelligence could be assigned numbers without requiring experimental data. The piling of the balls into a normal distribution was supposed to illustrate how a mean value would emerge from multiple tests.Francis Galton wrote in 1889 his book &quot;Natural Inheritance&quot;:Order in Apparent Chaos: I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the Law of Frequency of Error. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshalled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along.However, Galton also wished to demonstrate that extreme values of intelligence result from heredity, in apparent contradiction with his experiment since it produces extreme values as dispersion from randomness alone. Aware of this issue, he tried to address it in 1875 by arguing that his box did not reflect situations where bias would be introduced by what he called &quot;a main influence factor&quot;.

In a 1877 letter to George Darwin, Galton described a second version of the board, with two stages, where the compartments at the bottom of the highest stage had small trapdoors that would allow the balls of one chosen compartment to fall through the second stage. His goal was to illustrate his concept of &quot;reversion to mediocrity&quot;, i.e. that without marriage control the &quot;best&quot; parts of the population would mix with the &quot;mediocre&quot;, so that their offspring would gradually revert towards an average value. This version, however, was not built.

==Games==
Several games have been developed using the idea of pins changing the route of balls or other objects:
*Bagatelle
*Pachinko
*Payazzo
*Peggle
*Pinball
*Plinko
*The Wall
It is suggested that these games provided inspiration for Galton&#x27;s device.

<text>Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel (; 16 September 1853 – 5 July 1927) was a biochemist and pioneer in the study of genetics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his work in determining the chemical composition of nucleic acids, the genetic substance of biological cells.

Kossel isolated and described the five organic compounds that are present in nucleic acid: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds were later shown to be nucleobases, and are key in the formation of DNA and RNA, the genetic material found in all living cells.

Kossel was an important influence on and collaborator with other important researchers in biochemistry, including Henry Drysdale Dakin, Friedrich Miescher, Edwin B. Hart, and his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler. Kossel was editor of the Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) from 1895 until his death. Kossel also conducted important research into the composition of protein, and his research predicted the discovery of the polypeptide nature of the protein molecule.

The Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration at the University of Rostock is named in his honor.

==Early life and education==
Kossel was born in Rostock, Germany as the son of the merchant and Prussian consul Albrecht Karl Ludwig Enoch Kossel and his wife Clara Jeppe Kossel. As a youth, Kossel attended the Gymnasium at Rostock, where he evidenced substantial interest in chemistry and botany.

In 1872, Kossel attended the University of Strassburg to study medicine. He studied under Felix Hoppe-Seyler, who was head of the department of biochemistry, the only such institution in Germany at the time. He attended lectures by Anton de Bary, Waldeyer, August Kundt, and Baeyer. He completed his studies at University of Rostock, and passed his German medical license exam in 1877.

==Early research and collaboration==
After completing his university studies, Kossel returned to the University of Strassburg as research assistant to Felix Hoppe-Seyler. At the time, Hoppe-Seyler was intensely interested in research concerning an acidic substance that had first been chemically isolated from pus cells by one of his former students, Friedrich Miescher, in 1869. Unlike protein, the substance contained considerable amounts of phosphorus, but with its high acidity, it was unlike any cellular substance that had yet been observed.

Kossel showed that the substance, called &quot;nuclein&quot;, consisted of a protein component and a non-protein component. Kossel further isolated and described the non-protein component. This substance has become known as &quot;nucleic acid&quot;, which contains the genetic information found in all living cells.

==Isolation and description of nucleobases==
In 1883, Kossel left Strassburg to become Director of the Chemistry Division of the Physiological Institute at the University of Berlin. In this post, he succeeded Eugen Baumann and worked under the supervision of Emil du Bois-Reymond.

Kossel continued his previous work on the nucleic acids. During the period 1885 to 1901, he was able to isolate and name its five constituent organic compounds: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds are now known collectively as nucleobases, and they provide the molecular structure necessary in the formation of stable DNA and RNA molecules.

==Research into the chemical composition of protein==
In 1895, Kossel was professor of physiology as well as director of the Physiological Institute at the University of Marburg. Around this time, he began investigations into the chemical composition of proteins, the alterations in proteins during transformation into peptone, the peptide components of cells, and other investigations.

In 1896, Kossel discovered histidine, then worked out the classical method for the quantitative separation of the &quot;hexone bases&quot; (the alpha-amino acids arginine, histidine, and lysine). He was also the first to isolate theophylline, a therapeutic drug found naturally in tea and cocoa beans.

In 1901, Kossel was named to a similar post at Heidelberg University, and became director of the Heidelberg Institute for Protein Investigation. His research predicted the discovery of the polypeptide nature of the protein molecule.

==Nobel prize==
Kossel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his research in cell biology, the chemical composition of the cell nucleus, and for his work in isolating and describing nucleic acids. The award was presented on 10 December 1910.

In the autumn of 1911, Kossel was invited to the United States to deliver the Herter Lecture at Johns Hopkins. Traveling with his wife Luise and daughter Gertrude, he took the opportunity to travel and to visit acquaintances, one of which was Eugene W. Hilgard, professor emeritus of agricultural chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, who was also his wife&#x27;s cousin. He also visited and delivered lectures at several other universities, including the University of Chicago.

On the occasion of his visit to New York City, Kossel was interviewed by a reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Kossel&#x27;s English was reportedly very good, and his self-effacing modesty is voluminously mentioned in the reporter&#x27;s account.

His Herter lecture at Johns Hopkins was titled, &quot;The Proteins&quot;. This was the only time Kossel ever visited the United States.

==Later research and collaboration==
With his distinguished English pupil Henry Drysdale Dakin, Kossel investigated arginase, the ferment which hydrolyses arginine into urea and ornithine. Later, he discovered agmatine in herring roe and devised a method for preparing it.

Another of Kossel&#x27;s students was American biochemist Edwin B. Hart, who would later return to the United States to participate in the &quot;Single-grain experiment&quot; (1907–1911) and be part of research teams that would determine the nutritive causes of anemia and goiter. Another was Otto Folin, an American chemist who discovered Phosphocreatine.

In 1923, Kossel was honored by being named Germany&#x27;s representative to the Eleventh Physiological Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. When he appeared before the assembled scientists, they gave him an ovation that lasted several minutes. At the congress, he was conferred an honorary degree by the University of Edinburgh.

In 1924, Kossel became professor emeritus, but continued to lecture at Heidelberg University. In April 1927, he attended the Lister Centenary Celebration held in England.

During the last years of Kossel&#x27;s life, he conducted important research into the composition of the protein types protamines and histones, and introduced flavianic acid for the quantitative separation of arginine, histidine and lysine in proteins. A monograph describing this work was published shortly after his death.

==Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie==
Kossel contributed to early issues of the Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry). This publication was founded by his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler, in 1877, the same year that Kossel started work as his research assistant. After Hoppe-Seyler&#x27;s death in 1895, Kossel took over editorship of the Zeitschrift and continued in that role until his own death in 1927.

==Personal life==

In 1886, Kossel married Luise Holtzman, daughter of Adolf Holtzmann. Holtzmann was Professor at the University of Heidelberg, lecturing in German literature as well as Sanskrit. He was also a noted philologist of his day. The couple had three children, two of whom survived to maturity: Walther, born in 1888, and daughter Gertrude, born in 1889.

Son Walther Kossel (1888–1956) became a prominent physicist and was professor of theoretical physics and director of the Physics Institute at the University of Tübingen. He is known for his theory of the chemical bond (ionic bond/octet rule), the Sommerfeld–Kossel displacement law, and other achievements.

Albrecht Kossel was apparently not greatly interested in politics, but in 1914 he did not sign the propaganda Pronunciamento of German professors at the start of the war. He suffered under the lies which filled the world in war time. In 1917 Kossel was summoned by the government to pronounce that the allotted food provisions were sufficient. He refused this demand, would never declare untruths as truths

Through his marriage to Luise, Kossel was related to several prominent Americans, including soil science pioneer Eugene W. Hilgard, journalist and financier Henry Villard, and abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison.

Luise Kossel died in 1913 of acute pancreatitis. Kossel died quietly on 5 July 1927, after a recurring attack of angina pectoris. He is buried in Heidelberg, Germany.

==Legacy==
Albrecht Kossel is considered one of the great scientists of biochemistry and genetics. By isolating and defining nucleic acid and the nucleobases, he provided the necessary precursors that led to the double-helix model of DNA, diffraction photographed by Rosalind Franklin, further devised by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.

&quot; … his elucidation of the chemical nature of some building blocks that make up nucleic acids and chromatine has secured immortality for this exeedingly modest and almost shy man.&quot;

The Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration at the University of Rostock is named in his honor.

<text>Territorial authorities (Māori: &quot;mana ā-rohe&quot;) are a tier of local government in New Zealand, alongside regional councils. There are 67 territorial authorities: 13 city councils, 53 district councils and the Chatham Islands Council. District councils serve a combination of rural and urban communities, while city councils administer the larger urban areas. Auckland, Gisborne, Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough each have a unitary authority, which performs the functions of both a territorial authority and a regional council. The Chatham Islands Council is a &quot;sui generis&quot; territorial authority that is similar to a unitary authority.

Territorial authority districts are not subdivisions of regions, and some of them fall within more than one region. Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Regional councils are responsible for the administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the territorial authorities administer local roading and reserves, water supply and sanitation, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters. Some activities are delegated to council-controlled organisations. The scope of powers is specified by the Local Government Act 2002.

== History ==
===1989 local government reforms===
For many decades until the local government reforms of 1989, a borough with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city. The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so little distinction was made between the urban area and the local government area.

New Zealand&#x27;s local government structural arrangements were significantly reformed by the Local Government Commission in 1989 when approximately 700 councils and special purpose bodies were amalgamated to create 87 new local authorities. Regional councils were reduced in number from 20 to 13, territorial authorities (city/district councils) from 200 to 75, and special purpose bodies from over 400 to 7. The new district and city councils were generally much larger and most covered substantial areas of both urban and rural land. Many places that once had a city council were now being administered by a district council.

As a result, the term &quot;city&quot; began to take on two meanings.

&quot;City&quot; also came to be used in a less formal sense to describe major urban areas independent of local body boundaries. This informal usage is jealously guarded. Gisborne, for example, adamantly described itself as the first city in the world to see the new millennium. Gisborne is administered by a district council, but its status as a city is not generally disputed.

Under current law, an urban area has to be at least 50,000 residents before it can be officially proclaimed as a city.

===Changes since 1989===
Since the 1989 reorganisations, there have been few major reorganisations or status changes in local government. Incomplete list:
* 1991: Invercargill re-proclaimed a city.
* 1992: Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council abolished by a Local Government Amendment Act. Of its territorial authorities, the Kaikōura District was transferred to the Canterbury Region, and Nelson City and Tasman and Marlborough districts became unitary authorities.
* 1995: The Chatham Islands County was dissolved and reconstituted by an Act of Parliament as the &quot;Chatham Islands Territory&quot;, with powers similar to those of territorial authorities and some functions similar to those of a regional council.
* 2004: Tauranga became a city again on 1 March.
* 2006: The Banks Peninsula District merged into Christchurch as a result of a 2005 referendum.
* 2010: Auckland Council, a unitary authority, replaced seven local councils and the regional council.

Reports on completed reorganisation proposals since 1999 are available on the Local Government Commission&#x27;s site (link below).

=== 2007–2009 Royal Commission on Auckland Governance ===
On 26 March 2009, the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance recommended the Rodney, North Shore, Waitakere, Auckland City, Manukau, Papakura and Franklin territorial councils and the Auckland Regional Council be abolished and the entire Auckland region to be amalgamated into one &quot;supercity&quot;. The area would consist of one city council (with statutory provision for three Māori councillors), four urban local councils, and two rural local councils:
*Rodney local council would lose Orewa, Dairy Flat, and Whangaparaoa but retain the remainder of the current Rodney District. The split areas as well as the current North Shore City would form a Waitemata local council.
* Waitakere local council would consist of the current Waitakere City as well as the Avondale area.
* Tamaki Makaurau would consist of the current Auckland City and Otahuhu (excluding CBD)
* Manukau local council would consist of the urban parts of the current Manukau City and of the Papakura District.
* Hunua local council would consist of the entire Franklin District, much of which is currently in the Waikato Region, along with rural areas of the current Papakura District and Manukau City.
* The entire Papakura District would be dissolved between urban and rural councils.

The National-led Government responded within about a week. Its plan, which went to a Select Committee, accepted the proposal for supercity and many community boards, but rejected proposals for local councils and, initially, no separate seats for Māori.

Public reaction to the Royal Commission report was mixed, especially in regards to the Government&#x27;s amended proposal. Auckland Mayor John Banks supported the amended merger plans.

Criticism of the amended proposal came largely from residents in Manukau, Waitakere and North Shore Cities. In addition, Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples spoke against the exclusion of the Māori seats, as recommended by the Royal Commission. Opposition Leader Phil Goff called for a referendum on the issue.

=== Creation of Auckland Council ===
Auckland Council was created on 1 November 2010—a unitary authority that is classed as both a region and a territorial authority. It incorporated the recommendations of the Royal Commission and was established via legislation. Auckland Council is uniquely divided into &quot;local boards&quot; representing the lowest tier of local government.

===Failed proposed changes===
* 2015: Proposals to amalgamate local councils in Wellington and Northland were accepted by the Local Government Commission for consideration, although following consultation they ultimately were not formed into a final proposal. The status quo remains.
* 2015: Amalgamation of four local councils and the regional council in Hawke&#x27;s Bay was proposed by the Local Government Commission. A district wide referendum was held in Sep-2015, and the proposal was defeated by 66% of voters.
* 2015: The Local Government Commission received a proposal to review local government arrangements on the West Coast. In August 2016 the Commission decided to progress the application. The Commission then invited alternative applications to the original application. The Commission&#x27;s call for alternative reorganisation applications or other proposals for change to West Coast local government arrangements closed on 15 March 2017. The Commission received 23 responses, 19 of which made specific proposals for change. In December 2017 the Local Government Commission determined its preferred option for local government reorganisation on the West Coast to be the transfer of district plan preparation from the Buller, Grey and Westland district councils to the West Coast Regional Council.

===Youth councils===
Under the terms of the Local Government Act 2002, district councils have to represent the interests of their future communities and consider the views of people affected by their decisions. To fulfill that requirement and give young people a say in the decision-making process, many councils have a youth council.
 In late December 2023, the Ashburton District Council scrapped their youth council, stating they could engage better with younger people online and describing the current youth council as &quot;a youth club where they ate pizza.&quot; In early January 2024, the Gore District Council opted to restructure its youth council and ruled out dismantling it. In April 2024, the Whanganui District Council proposed scrapping its youth council by June 2024 as part of budget saving measures.

== List of territorial authorities ==
There are currently 67 territorial authorities. Before the Auckland Council &quot;super merge&quot; in November 2010, there were 73 territorial authorities. Before the Banks Peninsula District Council merged with the Christchurch City Council in 2006, there were 74 territorial authorities.


=== Offshore islands ===
There are a number of islands where the Minister of Local Government is the territorial authority, two of which have a &#x27;permanent population and/or permanent buildings and structures.&#x27; The main islands are listed below (population according to 2001 census in parentheses): 

* Bare Island
* Mayor Island / Tūhua (3)
* Mōtītī Island (30)
* Moutohora Island
* Whakaari / White Island

In addition, seven of the nine groups of the New Zealand outlying islands are outside of any territorial authority:

* Kermadec Islands (3)
* New Zealand Subantarctic Islands
** Antipodes Islands
** Auckland Islands
** Bounty Islands
** Campbell Islands
** Snares Islands / Tini Heke
* Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands

== Mayors ==

Territorial authorities have a mayor–council government. Mayors in New Zealand are directly elected—at-large, by all eligible voters within a territorial authority—in the local elections to a three-year term. The Local Government Act 2002 defines the role of a mayor as having to provide leadership to the other elected members of the territorial authority, be a leader in the community and perform civic duties.

<doc id="243913" wikidata="Q2714774" url="?curid=243913" title="Palace of Beaulieu">
<text>The Palace of Beaulieu ( ) or Newhall is a former royal palace in Boreham, Essex, England, north-east of Chelmsford. The surviving part is a Grade I listed building. The property is currently occupied by New Hall School.

== History ==

The estate on which it was built – the manor of &quot;Walhfare&quot; in Boreham – was granted to the Canons of Waltham Abbey in 1062. After various changes of possession, it was granted by the Crown to Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond in 1491. By this time, it had a house called New Hall.

In 1516, New Hall was sold by Thomas Boleyn, father of Anne Boleyn, to King Henry VIII for £1,000. The king rebuilt the house in brick at a cost of £17,000. He gave his new palace the name Beaulieu, meaning &quot;beautiful place&quot; in French. The name expressed Henry&#x27;s desire for fine things, though the name change did not outlast the century.

A royal wardrobe official, James Chapell, took measurements of the new apartments and travelled to Flanders to buy tapestries. He bought eleven different qualities of material, to cover an area of 3,238 Flemish ells (1,818 square yards). The chronicle writer Edward Hall describes a banquet and masque at &quot;Newhall, otherwyse called Beaulieu&quot; in September 1519. Eight disguised courtiers entered after the feast and danced with the ladies. Catherine of Aragon removed their visors or masks, revealing them to be all men aged over fifty. Another group of six younger men, including four hostages for the French treaty, then came in costume to dance.

On 23 July 1527 Henry&#x27;s court arrived at Beaulieu on his summer progress, staying, unusually, for over a month in the company of a large number of nobles and their wives, including Anne Boleyn&#x27;s father who had been created Viscount Rochford, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Marquess of Exeter, the Earls of Oxford, Essex, and Rutland, and Viscount Fitzwalter. It was here that Henry devised a scheme to allow him to cohabit with his intended successor of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, by obtaining a Papal bull that declared Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine invalid, effectively allowing him to commit bigamy by claiming he was technically unmarried in the first place. This plan was dropped when Cardinal Wolsey discovered the plan, though Pope Clement VII did, in fact, issue a bull to the same effect that December.

In October 1533, the daughter of Queen Catherine, Mary, and her companion Margaret Douglas, who had been staying at Beaulieu for some time, were evicted. The king had recently granted the palace to George Boleyn (Anne Boleyn&#x27;s brother). George had been a keeper at Beaulieu when the palace was in the hands of the king. The royal inventory of 1547 noted 29 great beds, four bathing rooms with wooden floors and beds set in the wall, and a library with 37 titles.

After Anne Boleyn was beheaded and Henry married Jane Seymour, he was convinced by his new wife to bring his daughters back to court. In 1537, when Queen Jane died after giving birth to a son, Edward, Mary, Henry&#x27;s eldest daughter was made godmother to her half-brother Edward and acted as chief mourner at the Queen&#x27;s funeral. Henry granted her a household and Mary was permitted to reside in royal palaces. Her privy purse expenses for nearly the whole of this period have been published and show that Hatfield Palace, the Palace of Beaulieu (also called Newhall), Richmond, and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence. Some of the furnishings at Newhall were taken away for Edward&#x27;s lodgings and wardrobe. Henry VIII gave Newhall to Mary as a bequest in his will, and it was her home during the reign of her brother Edward VI.

==Earls of Sussex and Buckingham==
Queen Elizabeth I granted the estate in 1573 to Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, who seems to have largely rebuilt the north wing. It is not known though whether he rebuilt other parts of the palace; a fire had occurred in Henry VIII&#x27;s time and the palace could have been mostly rebuilt then. Soon after the north range was completed, Thomas installed Elizabeth&#x27;s coat of arms above the main entrance which is still visible today. Elizabeth I came to New Hall in September 1579. She was greeted by a theatrical entertainment presenting Jupiter and a thunderstorm. The next day there was jousting. A sleeping knight was brought in a chariot led by a maiden, and appeared to be revived by the Queen. Elizabeth was given a horse, a cloak, and a riding safeguard for hunting the next day.

The 3rd Earl&#x27;s will details his furnishings, mentioning rooms at New Hall including the royal presence chamber hanged with tapestry of the &quot;Dance of Death&quot;. Some of the tapestry was supplied by Horatio Palavicino. A crimson velvet &quot;sparver&quot; canopy was embroidered with hands, dragons, and porcupines (recorded as &quot;porpentines&quot;). Another inventory notes tapestry with subjects including Alexander, Esther, and the Planets. Some tapestry remaining at Newhall in 1583 had been left by Mary I.

In July 1622, Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex, sold the house to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham for £30,000. James VI and I and Prince Charles visited in September 1622. It was said that Buckingham&#x27;s improvements to the house were directed by Inigo Jones. Balthazar Gerbier and a carpenter made an architectural model for the house. Buckingham improved the gardens with the help of John Tradescant.

During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell took possession of the estate for the sum of five shillings. After reverting to the 2nd Duke of Buckingham at the Restoration, it was sold to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, and the court of King Charles II was frequently entertained there. Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, visited in 1669 and a member of his retinue produced a view of the house. A copy of this view was published in 1821.
==New Hall in the 18th century==
Benjamin Hoare acquired the property in 1713, but it was in a poor state when purchased in 1737 by John Olmius, elevated to the peerage as Baron Waltham in 1762, who demolished and rebuilt much of the former palace. The north wing was left largely untouched and forms the present house. John was succeeded in 1762 by his son Drigue who died childless in 1787, aged 40, when New Hall devolved on his sister, the Honourable Elizabeth. However, she died the same year and her husband John Luttrell, later the Earl of Carhampton, took on the Olmius name; but, already owning the Carhampton estate including Painshill, he sold New Hall in 1798.

The purchasers in 1798 were the English nuns of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, who opened a Catholic school there the following year. New Hall School remains a school to this day. The Royal Arms of Henry VIII are in the school chapel. In 2006 a book, &quot;New Hall and its School&quot;, was published by Tony Tuckwell.

The Beaulieu name is now remembered in the name of the nearby housing estate, Beaulieu Park, Boreham.

In February 2009, Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; visited and excavated the grounds of the former palace. The special programme was broadcast on 13 April 2009. In the excavations, the team uncovered the chapel, west wing and the gatehouse.

<doc id="243916" wikidata="Q27358" url="?curid=243916" title="Head louse">
<text>The head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) is an obligate ectoparasite of humans. Head lice are wingless insects that spend their entire lives on the human scalp and feed exclusively on human blood. Humans are the only known hosts of this specific parasite, while chimpanzees and bonobos host a closely related species, &quot;Pediculus schaeffi&quot;. Other species of lice infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds.

Lice differ from other hematophagic ectoparasites such as fleas in spending their entire lifecycle on a host. Head lice cannot fly, and their short, stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.

The non-disease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying body louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two subspecies are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed. From genetic studies, they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. However, the degree of separation is contentious as they can produce fertile offspring in a laboratory.

A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or crab louse (&quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;), also infests humans. It is morphologically different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Louse infestation of the body is known as pediculosis, pediculosis capitis for head lice, pediculosis corporis for body lice, and phthiriasis for pubic lice.

==Adult morphology==

Like other insects of the suborder Anoplura, adult head lice are small (2.5–3 mm long), dorsoventrally flattened (see anatomical terms of location), and wingless. The thoracic segments are fused, but otherwise distinct from the head and abdomen, the latter being composed of seven visible segments. Head lice are grey in general, but their precise color varies according to the environment in which they were raised. After feeding, consumed blood causes the louse body to take on a reddish color.

===Head===

One pair of antennae, each with five segments, protrudes from the insect&#x27;s head. Head lice also have one pair of eyes. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae family, but are reduced or absent in most other members of the Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head louse mouthparts are highly adapted for piercing the skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect&#x27;s head except during feeding.

===Thorax===

Six legs project from the fused segments of the thorax. As is typical in the Anoplura, these legs are short and terminate with a single claw and opposing &quot;thumb&quot;. Between its claw and thumb, the louse grasps the hair of its host. With their short legs and large claws, lice are well adapted to clinging to the hair of their host. These adaptations leave them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. Lice can climb up strands of hair very quickly, allowing them to move quickly and reach another host.

===Abdomen===
Seven segments of the louse abdomen are visible. The first six segments each have a pair of spiracles through which the insect breathes. The last segment contains the anus and (separately) the genitalia.

===Sex differences===
In male lice, the front two legs are slightly larger than the other four. This specialized pair of legs are used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by a pointed end of the abdomen and a well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomens.

==Eggs and nits==
Like most insects, head lice are oviparous. Females lay about three or four eggs per day. Louse eggs (also known as &quot;nits&quot;), are attached near the base of a host hair shaft. Eggs are usually laid on the base of the hair, 3–5 mm off the scalp surface. In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid or more down the hair shaft.

To attach an egg, the adult female secretes a glue from her reproductive organ. This glue quickly hardens into a &quot;nit sheath&quot; that covers the hair shaft and large parts of the egg except for the operculum, a cap through which the embryo breathes. The glue was previously thought to be chitin-based, but more recent studies have shown it to be made of proteins similar to hair keratin.

Each egg is oval-shaped and about 0.8 mm in length. They are bright, transparent, and tan to coffee-colored so long as they contain an embryo, but appear white after hatching. Head lice hatch typically six to nine days after oviposition.

After hatching, the louse nymph leaves behind its egg shell, still attached to the hair shaft. The empty egg shell remains in place until physically removed by abrasion or the host, or until it slowly disintegrates, which may take six or more months.


Empty shells are matte, collapsed and white in color. The term &quot;nit&quot; may include any of the following:

* Viable eggs that will eventually hatch
* Remnants of already-hatched eggs (nits)
* Nonviable eggs (dead embryo) that will never hatch

Of these three, only eggs containing viable embryos have the potential to infest or reinfest a host. However, a no nit policy is a common public health measure to prevent transmission of lice. Some authors have therefore restricted the definition of nit to describe only a hatched or nonviable egg:



Others have retained the broad definition, while simultaneously attempting to clarify its relevance to infestation:



In British and Irish slang the term &quot;nit&quot; is often used, across different age groups, to refer to the head lice themselves.

==Development and nymphs==
Head lice, like other insects of the order Phthiraptera, are hemimetabolous. Newly hatched nymphs will moult three times before reaching the sexually mature adult stage. Thus, mobile head lice populations may contain eggs, nits, three nymphal instars, and the adults (male and female) (imago). Metamorphosis during head louse development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt, as well as the existence of reproductive organs in the adults. Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior is similar to the adult. Like adults, nymphs feed also only on human blood (hematophagia), and cannot survive long away from a host. Outside their hosts lice cannot survive more than 24 hrs. The time required for head lice to complete their nymph development to the imago lasts for 12–15 days.

Nymph mortality in captivity is about 38%, especially within the first two days of life. In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar. Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal. Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon. During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host&#x27;s blood throughout the insect body. This results in death within a day or two. Whether the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild is unclear.

==Reproduction and lifespan==
 Head lice reproduce sexually, and copulation is necessary for the female to produce fertile eggs. Parthenogenesis, the production of viable offspring by virgin females, does not occur in &quot;Pediculus humanus&quot;. Pairing can begin within the first 10 hours of adult life. After 24 hours, adult lice copulate frequently, with mating occurring during any period of the night or day. Mating attachment frequently lasts more than an hour. Young males can successfully pair with older females, and vice versa.

Experiments with &quot;P. h. humanus&quot; (body lice) emphasize the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with six or more males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red—a condition attributed to rupture of the alimentary canal during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, copulation. During its lifespan of 4 weeks a female louse lays 50-150 eggs. Eggs hatch within 6–9 days, each nymphal stage last for 4–5 days and accordingly the period from egg to adults lasts for 18–24 days. Adult lice live for an additional 3–4 weeks.

==Factors affecting infestation==
The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in head louse infestation. Girls are two to four times more frequently infested than boys. Children between 4 and 14 years of age are the most frequently infested group.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
All stages except eggs are blood-feeders and bite the skin four to five times daily to feed. They inject saliva which contains an anticoagulant and suck blood. The digested blood is excreted as dark red frass.

===Position on host===
Although any part of the scalp may be colonized, lice favor the nape of the neck and the area behind the ears, where the eggs are usually laid. Head lice are repelled by light and move towards shadows or dark-coloured objects in their vicinity.

===Transmission===
Lice have no wings or powerful legs for jumping, so they use the claws on their legs to move from hair to hair. Normally, head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, hats, brushes, towels, clothing, beds, or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission.

==Distribution==
About 6–12 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. In the UK, it is estimated that two thirds of children will experience at least one case of head lice before leaving primary school. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Israel, and Sweden.

==Archaeogenetics==
Analysis of the DNA of lice found on Peruvian mummies may indicate that some diseases (such as typhus) may have passed from the New World to the Old World, instead of the other way around.

==Genome==
The sequencing of the genome of the body louse was first proposed in the mid-2000s and the annotated genome was published in 2010. An analysis of the body and head louse transcriptomes revealed these two organisms are extremely similar genetically. 

Unlike other bilateral animals, the 37 mitochondrial genes of human lice are not on a single circular chromosome but extensively fragmented. For the head louse, and the body louse, they are on 20 minichromosomes, for the pubic louse 14 minichromosomes and the chimpanzee louse,18 minichromosomes.

== Mitochondrial clades ==
Human lice are divided into three deeply divergent mitochondrial clades known as A, B, and C. Three subclades have been identified, D (a sister clade of A), E (a sister clade of C), and F (a sister clade of B).

=== Clade A ===
* head and body: worldwide
*found in ancient Roman Judea

=== Clade D (sister of clade A) ===
* head and body: Central Africa, Ethiopia, United States

=== Clade B ===
* head only: worldwide
* found in ancient Roman Judea and 4,000-year-old Chilean mummy

===Clade F (sister of clade B)===
* head and body: South America

=== Clade C ===
* head only: Ethiopia, Nepal, Thailand

=== Clade E (sister of clade C) ===
* head only: West Africa

<doc id="243919" wikidata="Q2397931" url="?curid=243919" title="Mary Whitehouse">
<text>Constance Mary Whitehouse (; 13 June 1910 – 23 November 2001) was a British teacher and conservative activist. She campaigned against social liberalism and the mainstream British media, both of which she accused of encouraging a more permissive society. She was the founder and first president of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, through which she led a longstanding campaign against the BBC. A hard-line social conservative, she was termed a reactionary by her socially liberal opponents. Her motivation derived from her Christian beliefs, her aversion to the rapid social and political changes in British society of the 1960s, and her work as a teacher of sex education.

Whitehouse became an art teacher, at the same time becoming involved in evangelical Christian groups such as the Student Christian Movement (which became increasingly more liberal leading up to, and after, a 1928 split with the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship) and Moral Re-Armament. She became a public figure via the Clean-Up TV pressure group, established in 1964, in which she was the most prominent figure. The following year she founded the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for what she perceived as a lack of accountability and excessive use of bad language and portrayals of sex and violence in its programmes. During the 1970s she broadened her activities and was a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light, a Christian campaign that gained mass support for a period. She initiated a successful private prosecution against &quot;Gay News&quot; on the grounds of blasphemous libel, the first such case for more than 50 years. Another private prosecution was against the director of the play &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;, which had been performed at the National Theatre.

Whitehouse&#x27;s campaigns continue to divide opinion. Her critics have accused her of being a highly censorious, bigoted figure, and her traditional moral convictions brought her into direct conflict with advocates of the sexual revolution, feminism, children&#x27;s rights, and LGBT rights. Others see her more positively and believe she was attempting to halt a decline in Britain&#x27;s moral standards. According to Ben Thompson, the editor of an anthology of Whitehouse-related letters published in 2012, &quot;From[...] feminist anti-pornography campaigns to the executive naming and shaming strategies of UK Uncut, her ideological and tactical influence has been discernible in all sorts of unexpected places in recent years.&quot;

==Early life==
Whitehouse was born in Croft Road, Nuneaton, Warwickshire. (In her autobiography, she claimed that the house later became a sex shop). She was the second of four children of a &quot;less-than-successful businessman&quot; and a &quot;necessarily resourceful mother&quot;. She won a scholarship to Chester City Grammar School, where she was keen on hockey and tennis, and after leaving she did two years of unpaid apprentice teaching at St John&#x27;s School in Chester, Cheshire. At the Cheshire County Teacher Training College in Crewe, specialising in secondary school art teaching, she was involved with the Student Christian Movement before qualifying in 1932. She became an art teacher at Lichfield Road School in Wednesfield, where she stayed for eight years, and at Brewood Grammar School, both in Staffordshire.

She joined the Wolverhampton branch of the Oxford Group, later known as Moral Re-Armament (MRA), in 1935. At MRA meetings she met Ernest Raymond Whitehouse; they married at Chester on 23 March 1940 and remained married until he died in Colchester, Essex, aged 87, in 2000. The couple had five sons, two of whom (twins) died in infancy.

Whitehouse returned to teaching in 1953. That year she broadcast on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on the day before the coronation of Elizabeth II &quot;as a loyal housewife and subject&quot; and wrote an extensive article on homosexuality for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. According to Ben Thompson this concerned how a mother might &quot;best avoid inadvertently pressuring her sons towards that particular orientation&quot; and gained enough attention to be republished as a pamphlet.

She taught art and was senior mistress at Madeley Modern School in Madeley, Shropshire, from 1960, taking responsibility for sex education. Shocked at the moral beliefs of her pupils, she became concerned about what she and many others perceived as declining moral standards in the British media, especially in the BBC. She gave up teaching at the end of 1964 to concentrate on her campaigning.

==Clean Up TV campaign and the NVALA==

===Beginnings===
Whitehouse began her activism in 1963 with a letter to the BBC requesting to see Hugh Greene, the BBC&#x27;s Director-General. Greene was out of the country at the time, so she accepted an invitation to meet Harman Grisewood, his deputy, a Roman Catholic who she felt listened to her with understanding. Over the next few months though, she continued to be dissatisfied with what she saw on television.

With Norah Buckland, the wife of a vicar, she launched the Clean Up TV (CUTV) Campaign in January 1964 with a manifesto appealing to the &quot;women of Britain&quot;. The campaign&#x27;s first public meeting, on 5 May 1964, was held in Birmingham Town Hall. Richard Whitehouse, one of her sons, recalled in 2008: &quot;Coaches arrived from all over the country. Two thousand people poured in and suddenly there was my mother on a podium inspiring them to rapturous applause. Her hands were shaking. But she didn&#x27;t stop.&quot;

Although he regularly clashed with Whitehouse, the academic Richard Hoggart shared some of her opinions and was present on the platform with her at this meeting. &quot;The Times&quot; commented the following day: &quot;Perhaps never before in the history of the Birmingham Town Hall has such a successful meeting been sponsored by such a flimsy organisation.&quot;

===Sir Hugh Greene at the BBC===
Hugh Greene, knighted in January 1964, became her &quot;&quot;. He was, according to Whitehouse, &quot;the devil incarnate&quot; who &quot;more than anybody else ... [was] responsible for the moral collapse in this country.&quot; The CUTV manifesto asserted that the BBC under Greene spread &quot;the propaganda of disbelief, doubt and dirt ... promiscuity, infidelity and drinking&quot;. In place of this, the authors argued, the corporation&#x27;s activities should &quot;encourage and sustain faith in God and bring Him back to the hearts of our family and national life.&quot; Interviewed by the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; for its Christmas 1965 issue, Whitehouse thought the BBC loaded its programmes in favour of the &#x27;new morality&#x27;. She commented about one unnamed television programme, believing it to be &quot;unbalanced&quot; and biased, in which &quot;youngsters were asking questions [and] there was not a single member of the panel who was prepared to say outright that pre-marital relations were wrong. In fact, when a girl asked a clergyman, &#x27;Do you think that fornication is sin?&#x27; he replied, &#x27;It depends on what you mean by sin and what you mean by fornication. Whitehouse thought it was a &quot;big hazard&quot; for &quot;present-day children&quot; that &quot;so many adults do not stand for anything&quot; and affirmed that it was the responsibility of the BBC to have a &quot;missionary role&quot; to compensate for this social deficiency.

The Clean Up TV petition, using the manifesto, gained 500,000 signatures. Whitehouse complained in 1993 that during Greene&#x27;s period at the BBC &quot;hardly a week went by without a sniping reference to me&quot;. Whitehouse&#x27;s critics responded quickly. The playwright David Turner had heckled her at Birmingham Town Hall; his work was criticised during the meeting. Within a few months, an episode of &quot;Swizzlewick&quot;, a twice-weekly serial he created, featured a parody of her as Mrs Smallgood.

In a speech Greene delivered in 1965 he argued, without naming Whitehouse direct, that the critics of his liberalisation of broadcasting policy would &quot;attack whatever does not underwrite a set of prior assumptions&quot; and saw the potential for &quot;a dangerous form of censorship ... which works by causing artists and writers not to take risks&quot;. He defended the right of the BBC &quot;to be ahead of public opinion&quot;. Greene ignored Whitehouse, blocked her from participation in BBC broadcasts, and purchased a painting of Whitehouse with five breasts by James Lawrence Isherwood.

The National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association (later known as Mediawatch-UK) was launched to succeed CUTV in November 1965, with Whitehouse&#x27;s then home in Claverley, Shropshire, hosting its first office, replacing what they themselves perceived as CUTV&#x27;s negativity with an active campaign for legislative change. The former cabinet minister Bill Deedes, later editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, supported the group in that period and was the leading speaker at NVALA&#x27;s founding conference in Birmingham on 30 April 1966, and acted as a contact between his parliamentary colleagues and Whitehouse. Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham, was another high-profile politician who gave his support to NVALA and Whitehouse at that time.

Through the letters she frequently sent to Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, Whitehouse caused particular difficulties for civil servants at 10 Downing Street. Reportedly, for some time Downing Street intentionally &quot;lost&quot; her letters to avoid having to respond to them. It has though been suggested that her contact with parliamentarians helped give her some leverage over the BBC which her own direct communication with the corporation&#x27;s executives could not achieve. Although accepting the differences between them, Whitehouse wrote to Wilson on 1 January 1968: &quot;You have always treated our approaches to you seriously and with courtesy.&quot;

Geoffrey Robertson, QC, suggests that when Greene left the BBC in 1969, contrary to the view that it was because of disagreements over the appointment of the Conservative Lord Hill as BBC chairman in 1967, whereby she could be given some credit for his departure, it was more to do with a political struggle between the BBC and the Labour Prime Minister, Wilson. However Hill was prepared to meet Whitehouse at Broadcasting House.

===Television and war===
War coverage met with her objections. During his brief period as editor of &quot;Panorama&quot; (1965–66), Jeremy Isaacs received a letter from Whitehouse complaining about his decision to repeat Richard Dimbleby&#x27;s coverage of the liberation of the Belsen concentration camp. She complained about this &quot;filth&quot; being allowed on air as &quot;it was bound to shock and offend&quot;. In a 1994 interview, Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was &quot;an awful intrusion&quot; and &quot;very off-putting&quot;.

Later in 1965, the decision by the BBC not to broadcast Peter Watkins&#x27; &quot;The War Game&quot; on 6 August 1965 led to Whitehouse writing to Sir Hugh Greene and Harold Wilson on 5 September, and again to the Home Secretary Frank Soskice on 6 October. In her view, a decision over whether to broadcast Watkins&#x27; film should be taken by the Home Office rather than the BBC. Nuclear war was &quot;too serious a matter to be treated as entertainment. For a producer to be allowed, as now appears possible, to prejudice the effectiveness of our Civil Defence Services, or the ability of the British people to re-act with courage, initiative and control in a crisis, surely goes far beyond the responsibility&quot; which should be given to someone in this role. The letter was leaked at the time and extracts were published.

The contemporary coverage of the Vietnam War, &quot;the first &#x27;television war, demonstrated for Whitehouse that television was &quot;an ally of pacifism&quot;. In a 1970 speech to the Royal College of Nursing she argued that &quot;[h]owever good the cause ... the horrific effects on men and terrain of modern warfare as seen on the television screen could well sap the will of a nation to safeguard its own freedom, let alone resist the forces of evil abroad.&quot; Trying to reconcile this &quot;pacifism&quot; with her objection to fictional violence, she saw such news coverage as &quot;desensitisation&quot; in which the media use the &quot;techniques of violence&quot; to raise &quot;impact&quot; in order &quot;to satisfy an apparently insatiable demand for realism&quot;.

===Programmes: comedy and drama from the mid-1960s to 1980===
The situation comedy &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; attacked many of the things Whitehouse cherished. She objected to its profane language: &quot;I doubt if many people would use 121 bloodies in half-an-hour&quot;, and &quot;Bad language coarsens the whole quality of our life. It normalises harsh, often indecent language, which despoils our communication.&quot;

Whitehouse and the NVALA won a libel action against the BBC and its writer Johnny Speight in July 1967 with a full apology and substantial damages, after Speight implied in a BBC radio interview that the organisation&#x27;s members and its head were fascists. Shortly after Speight&#x27;s interview, she was mocked in an episode of the series entitled &quot;Alf&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (27 February 1967). Alf Garnett is shown reading her book &quot;Cleaning Up TV&quot;, and agreeing with every word, but the episode ends with the book being burned to exclamations of &quot;Unclean, unclean&quot;.

Whitehouse was critical of comedians such as Benny Hill and his use of dancers; she described Dave Allen as &quot;offensive, indecent and embarrassing&quot; after a comic account of a conversation following sexual intercourse. In return, comedy writers during this era saw her as possessing humorous potential. The Goodies comedy team created an episode (&quot;Gender Education&quot;, 1971) with the principal objective of irritating her.

Whitehouse criticised the work of Dennis Potter from &quot;Son of Man&quot; (1969) onwards, arguing that the BBC was at the centre &quot;of a conspiracy to remove the myth of god from the minds of men&quot;, and also &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). In the case of the violence in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, she rejected any attempt to show a &#x27;copycat&#x27; correlation in academic studies, but urged its acceptance as a fact arrived at by common sense. In December 1974, she wrote of the &quot;deliberate propagation&quot; of the idea that there is no proof of the effects of television on &quot;standards and behaviour&quot;. To reject its effect, and its ability to &quot;declaim or pervert truth, is to deny the potency of communication itself, it is crazily to question the ability of education to affect the social conscience and to train the human mind&quot;.

Chuck Berry&#x27;s novelty song &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot; was one of several pop songs to receive Whitehouse&#x27;s disapproval in this period. She was unsuccessful in trying to persuade the BBC to ban it, but her campaign to stop Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; being featured on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was successful. Cooper sent her a bunch of flowers, since he believed the publicity helped the song to reach number one. 
The NVALA had around 150,000 members at its peak, but claimed 30,000 in April 1977.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; met with her heaviest disapproval during Philip Hinchcliffe&#x27;s tenure as producer between 1975 and 1977. She described the serial &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975) as consisting of &quot;teatime brutality for tots&quot;, said &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; (1976) &quot;contained some of the sickest and most horrific material seen on children&#x27;s television&quot;, and on &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976), in which the Doctor (Tom Baker) survives an encounter with a giant carnivorous plant monster, she commented: &quot;Strangulation—by hand, by claw, by obscene vegetable matter—is the latest gimmick, sufficiently close up so they get the point. And just for a little variety, show the children how to make a Molotov cocktail.&quot;

Following her complaint about &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (broadcast later in 1976), Whitehouse received an apology from the Director-General of the BBC, Sir Charles Curran. A freeze-frame cliffhanger ending to the third episode, in which the Doctor appeared to drown, was altered for repeat showings. The series&#x27; next producer, Graham Williams, was told to lighten the tone and reduce the violence following Whitehouse&#x27;s complaints. Senior television executives commented that at this time her views were not disregarded lightly.

Philip Hinchcliffe later remarked, &quot;I always felt that Mary Whitehouse thought of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a children&#x27;s programme, for little children, and it wasn&#x27;t ... so she was really coming at the show from the wrong starting-point.&quot;

===After 1980===
Whitehouse criticised the ITV adventure/drama series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984–1986). Simon Farquhar, in an obituary for &quot;The Independent&quot; of the series&#x27; creator, Richard Carpenter, wrote that Whitehouse &quot;objected to the [show&#x27;s] relentless slaughter and blasphemous religious elements, but was deftly silenced by Carpenter in public when he introduced himself to her and the audience by saying &quot;I&#x27;m Richard Carpenter, and I&#x27;m a professional writer. And you&#x27;re a professional... what?&quot;

Within a week of the launch of Channel 4 in November 1982, Whitehouse was objecting to swear words in the soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; and two feature films the channel screened, &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970) and &quot;Network&quot; (1976). On 25 November, she called for the resignation of the channel&#x27;s chief executive, Jeremy Isaacs, over a scene in &quot;Brookside&quot; &quot;in which a young thug had tried to force a schoolgirl to have sex with him&quot;, according to an item in &quot;The Times&quot;.

In 1984 Whitehouse won a case in the High Court against John Whitney, director-general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, who had failed to forward the feature film &quot;Scum&quot; (1979) for consideration by other IBA board members to decide if Channel 4 should transmit it. The channel had screened the theatrical remake, based on a then-banned BBC television play, in June 1983. The High Court decision was overturned on appeal when it reached the House of Lords.

Whitehouse&#x27;s supporters have asserted that her campaigns helped end Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;red triangle&quot; series of films in 1986, so named after the warning preceding them which featured a red triangle with a white centre. The broadcasting of these films with the triangle had received criticism from opponents of Whitehouse. 

In 1988, she made an extended appearance on the British TV discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside James Dearden, Shere Hite, Joan Wyndham, Naim Attallah and others. She was said to have had a role in the establishment of the Broadcasting Standards Council in 1988, which later became the Broadcasting Standards Commission and was subsumed into the Office of Communications in 2004.

In August 1989, in a broadcast of &quot;In the Psychiatrist&#x27;s Chair&quot; on BBC Radio, Whitehouse confused the playwright with his hero in &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;. She claimed that Dennis Potter&#x27;s mother had &quot;committed adultery with a strange man and that the shock of witnessing this had caused her son to be afflicted&quot; with psoriatic arthropathy. Potter&#x27;s mother won substantial damages from the BBC and &quot;The Listener&quot;. Whitehouse alleged she had a blackout at the interview&#x27;s halfway point and claimed her comments were not intentional.

Some years earlier, Potter had publicly defended Whitehouse on several occasions without agreeing with her arguments.

Whitehouse stepped down as President of the National Viewers and Listeners Association in May 1994. Michael Grade, at the time the Chief Executive of Channel 4, reflected on her career:

 At the same time, William Rees-Mogg, Chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, commented that she was &quot;on the whole a force for the good, an important woman&quot;.

==Other campaigns and private prosecutions==

===Permissiveness===
Whitehouse had taken up other campaigns against the permissive society by the early 1970s. She objected to the UK edition of &quot;The Little Red Schoolbook&quot;, &quot;a manual of children&#x27;s rights&quot; on sex, drugs and attitudes to adults, which was successfully prosecuted for obscenity in July 1971. It was originally published in Denmark where, according to Whitehouse, it had done &quot;incalculable damage&quot; and was &quot;a revolutionary primer&quot;, in which &quot;open rebellion against the &#x27;system&#x27;, be it school, parents or authority generally, was openly advocated, while children were constantly exhorted to collect evidence against teachers of alleged injustices or anything which was likely to enhance revolution.&quot;

She was &quot;greatly relieved—for the sake of the children&quot; at the £50 fine and £115.50 costs imposed on Richard Handyside and Geoffrey Collins, its publishers, who also had works by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro on their small list of publications. For Whitehouse it was a &quot;fundamental right of a child to be a child&quot; and &quot;the duty of mature people to ensure that childhood is protected against the inroads of those who would exploit its immaturity for political, social or personal gain.&quot; A modified second edition was allowed to be published in the UK, but the original verdict in the prosecution was sustained in the Appeal Court and the European Court of Human Rights (see &quot;Handyside v United Kingdom&quot;). An unexpurgated edition of the book, bar one minor cut, was published in the UK during July 2014.

Along with the (Catholic) Labour peer Lord Longford, Malcolm Muggeridge and Cliff Richard, Whitehouse was a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light, which protested against the commercial exploitation of sex and violence. The Festival&#x27;s mass &quot;rally against permissiveness&quot; in Trafalgar Square was attended by 50,000 people in September 1971. On 25 August that year she had had an audience with Pope Paul VI regarding &#x27;moral pollution&#x27;, in which she attempted to present the pontiff with &quot;Oz28&quot; and the &quot;Little Red School Book&quot;, but these items found their way to an official of the Papal See instead. In his foreword to Whitehouse&#x27;s book, &quot;Who Does She Think She Is?&quot; (1971), Malcolm Muggeridge wrote: &quot;It is literally true that but for her the total demolition of all Christian decencies and values in this country would have taken place virtually without a word of public protest.&quot;

Following the release on appeal of the defendants in the &quot;Oz&quot; trial, &quot;an unmitigated disaster for the children of our country&quot;, Whitehouse launched the Nationwide Petition for Public Decency in January 1972, which gained 1.35 million signatures by the time it was presented to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, in April 1973. She had around 300 speaking engagements during the period of her highest profile. A tour of Australia in 1978 was met by counter-protests by feminists and others in various cities and she was hit with a cream pie in Brisbane. A pornographic magazine &quot;Whitehouse&quot; was launched in 1975 by publisher David Sullivan, who deliberately named it after her.

=== Opposition to paedophilia and child pornography ===
The Paedophile Information Exchange had been asked to help the Albany Trust, which received public money, to produce a booklet on paedophilia, which was to have been published by the Trust. Whitehouse mentioned the connection in a speech, asserting that public funds were being used to subsidise paedophile groups, and the Trust withdrew its support for the production of the pamphlet in 1977. However, PIE itself did not receive public funding.

Her subsequent petition against paedophilia and child pornography was signed by million people. Whitehouse urged the Conservative opposition to push for a bill on the subject, in the absence of interest from the Labour government. The private member&#x27;s bill proposed by Conservative MP Cyril Townsend became the Protection of Children Act 1978.

===&quot;Gay News&quot; and other cases of alleged blasphemy===
Whitehouse took private prosecutions in a number of cases where official action was not forthcoming. The action against &quot;Gay News&quot; in 1977 concerned &quot;The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name&quot;, a poem by James Kirkup, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, the theme of which was the sexual fantasies of a Roman centurion about the body of Jesus Christ. She was the plaintiff in a charge of blasphemous libel against &quot;Gay News&quot; (&quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot;), a trial at the Old Bailey between 4 and 7 July 1977. It was the first prosecution for the offence since 1922. &quot;I simply had to protect Our Lord&quot;, said Whitehouse at the time, Kirkup&#x27;s poem being in her opinion &quot;the recrucifixion of Christ by 20th-century weapons&quot;. The prosecution counsel John Smyth, representing Whitehouse, told the jury: &quot;It may be said that this is a love poem—it is not, it is a poem about buggery&quot;, while the defence case was that the poem suggested all of mankind could love Jesus Christ. The Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan and Cardinal Basil Hume both declined Whitehouse&#x27;s invitation to give evidence at the trial.

Denis Lemon, the editor and owner of &quot;Gay News&quot;, published the poem in the 3–16 June 1976 issue on the basis that the &quot;message and intention of the poem was to celebrate the absolute universality of God&#x27;s love&quot;. Whitehouse told Michael Tracey and David Morrison, the authors of a book about her: &quot;I think it shook me more than anything I had seen or come into contact with all the time I had been campaigning. ... I don&#x27;t think Jesus Christ has ever been more real to me as a person than he was at that particular moment.&quot;

&quot;Gay News&quot; lost the case; the jury decided the case on a 10–2 majority. Lemon and his paper were fined, and Lemon received a nine-month suspended prison sentence. A &quot;Guardian&quot; editorial after the verdict said of the trial: &quot;No evidence was called, or allowed to be called, about the merits of the poem in literature or theology&quot;, despite the case concerning blasphemy, or to suggest that Kirkup&#x27;s intention had been to &quot;scandalise&quot; which, given the poet&#x27;s &quot;list of serious works&quot;, the newspaper thought should have been proven. The judge in at the prosecution, Alan King-Hamilton QC, had only allowed novelist Margaret Drabble and journalist Bernard Levin to appear as &quot;character&quot; witnesses for the newspaper. &quot;The Spectator&quot; editorial on 15 July commented: &quot;The prosecution was perverse, the verdict misguided. As for the punishments, given that this was in effect a test case, they are excessive&quot; and &quot;left the law on obscenity even more muddled and confused than it was before, and have served no useful purpose whatsoever, except to delight Mrs Whitehouse&quot;. The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords dismissed appeals, although Lemon&#x27;s suspended prison sentence was overturned.

The backlash that Whitehouse received led her to suggest that an &quot;intellectual/homosexual/humanist lobby&quot; was to blame, a comment that did not escape the attention of members of this as yet non-existent group. The &quot;Gay Humanist Group&quot;, later GALHA and now LGBT Humanists UK, came into being in 1979. Maureen Duffy, the group&#x27;s honorary president, described the group as driven by an &quot;ethics of compassion&quot;, best characterised &quot;a fluid morality, based on a perception of fellowness, fellow feeling, fellow suffering&quot;. Ever since its foundation, LGBT Humanists UK has continued to organise events, assist those seeking asylum who are fleeing anti-LGBT+ prejudice and/or religious discrimination, and to provide a site of fellowship and community for non-religious LGBT+ communities in the UK.

Geoffrey Robertson, QC, the barrister for &quot;Gay News&quot; in the case, described Whitehouse as homophobic in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2008, saying: &quot;Her fear of homosexuals was visceral&quot;. He describes the beliefs she reveals in her book, &quot;Whatever Happened to Sex?&quot;, as &quot;nonsense&quot;, such as her assertion that &quot;homosexuality was caused by abnormal parental sex &#x27;during pregnancy or just after, saying that for her, &quot;being gay was like having acne: &#x27;Psychiatric literature proves that 60 per cent of homosexuals who go for treatment get completely cured.

Whitehouse had hoped to use the blasphemy laws against material other than Kirkup&#x27;s poem and was interested in pursuing a possible action against allegedly blasphemous content for some time. She had hoped that it could be used as a basis for prosecution if Jens Jørgen Thorsen succeeded in his effort to produce the film &quot;The Many Faces of Jesus&quot;—which depicted Jesus engaged in sex acts with men and women—in the United Kingdom. The NVALA sent a translated copy of the screenplay to William Whitelaw, the shadow home secretary, and urged the Home Office to deny Thorsen entry. Whitehouse gained more widespread support regarding Thorsen than in the &quot;Gay News&quot; dispute. NVALA organised a publicity campaign, which resulted in Thorsen&#x27;s intentions gaining significant public condemnation in September 1976 from leading public figures, including Queen Elizabeth II, who described the planned film as &quot;obnoxious&quot; in response to NVALA letters. In February 1977, Thorsen was denied entry to the United Kingdom after he arrived at Heathrow Airport carrying a copy of the &quot;Many Faces of Jesus&quot; screenplay. Home Secretary Merlyn Rees explained, to cheers in Parliament, that the action was &quot;on the grounds that his exclusion was conducive to the public good&quot;.

Whitehouse and a letter writing campaign from the Festival of Light, after unsuccessfully lobbying the British Board of Film Classification to refuse the film a certificate, were successful in persuading some councils in Britain to ban screenings of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979) in their areas on unproven grounds that the film is blasphemous. Nearly a decade later, a threatened campaign by Whitehouse against Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), with the law against blasphemy still in force at the time, failed to materialise.

===&quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;===
In 1982 she pursued a private prosecution against Michael Bogdanov, the director of a National Theatre production of Howard Brenton&#x27;s &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;, a play that &quot;drew a direct parallel between the Roman invasion of Celtic Britain in 54 BC and the contemporary British presence in Northern Ireland&quot;. The first act contains &quot;a brief scene&quot; of (simulated) anal rape—the police had visited the production three times and found no basis for legal action. In the prosecution Whitehouse&#x27;s counsel claimed Section 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which described the offence of &quot;procuring an act of gross indecency&quot;, was applicable. Because this was a general Act, there was no possibility of defence on the basis of artistic merit, unlike that permitted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

Since Whitehouse had not seen the play, the prosecution evidence rested on the testimony of her solicitor, Graham Ross-Cornes, who claimed he saw the actor&#x27;s penis. However, cross-examination revealed that he had seen a performance of the play from the back row of the stalls, 90 feet from the stage. Lord Hutchinson, counsel for Bogdanov, was able to demonstrate the nature of the illusion performed on stage. This was achieved by suggesting that it might have been the actor&#x27;s thumb protruding from his fist, rather than his erect penis. The defence had argued that the Act did not apply to the theatre; the judge Mr Justice Staughton then ruled that it did. After three days, the action was withdrawn after the prosecution counsel told Whitehouse that he was unable to continue with the case; the litigation was ended by the Attorney General putting forward a plea of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;. Both sides claimed a victory; Whitehouse&#x27;s side asserted that the important legal point had been made with the ruling on the applicability of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, while Bogdanov said it was because she knew that he would not be convicted. Whitehouse had to meet £20,000 costs, most of which was paid by an anonymous donor.

Whitehouse&#x27;s account of the trial is recorded in &quot;A Most Dangerous Woman&quot; (); she wrote that she was of the opinion that the legal point had been established, and they had no wish to criminalise Bogdanov, the play&#x27;s director.

===Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government===
By the 1980s, Whitehouse had found a powerful ally in the Conservative government, particularly in Margaret Thatcher herself, whose support base partially consisted of social conservatives. It has been claimed by the Conservative journalist Bruce Anderson that the market orientation of the Thatcher government prejudiced it against Whitehouse in private.

It has been claimed by commentators not necessarily in agreement with her that Whitehouse&#x27;s efforts played a part in the passage of the Protection of Children Act 1978, the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981, which concerned sex shops, and the Video Recordings Act 1984, which banned &#x27;video nasties&#x27;, a term reportedly coined by Whitehouse. She screened edited highlights from these films for MPs at the House of Commons in late 1983, which included extracts from &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981) considered by her &quot;the number one nasty&quot;. It was &quot;a highly effective means of lobbying the government to introduce tight state controls on the burgeoning video industry&quot;.

Around 1986, papers released in late December 2014 indicate, Whitehouse met Thatcher on at least two occasions to discuss the possibility of banning sex toys using a potential extension of the &quot;deprave and corrupt&quot; provision in the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The plan was abandoned because the Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, thought the concept of public taste would be a problematic concept for legal action.

==Later years and assessments of her influence==
Whitehouse was appointed a CBE in 1980. In 1988, she suffered a spinal injury in a fall, which severely curbed her campaigning activities. Whitehouse retired as president of the NVALA in 1994. She died, aged 91, in a nursing home in Colchester, Essex, on 23 November 2001. Whitehouse is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary the Virgin at Dedham in Essex.
The journalist Mary Kenny believes &quot;Mary Whitehouse was a significant figure. Some of her battles were justified, even prophetic. Today her attacks on &#x27;kiddie porn&#x27; would be widely supported.&quot; The academic Richard Hoggart observed: &quot;her main focus was on sex, followed by bad language and violence. Odd: if she had reversed the order, she might have been more effective.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, the philosopher Mary Warnock opined, &quot;Even if her campaigning did not succeed in &#x27;cleaning up TV&#x27;, still less in making it more fit to watch in other ways, she was of serious intent, and was an influence for good at a crucial stage in the development both of the BBC and of ITV. She was not, as the BBC seemed officially to proclaim, a mere figure of fun.&quot;

The papers of the NVALA for 1970–1990 have been deposited at the library of the University of Essex.

Whitehouse&#x27;s early campaign and her disagreements with the BBC under Greene were the basis of a drama first broadcast in 2008 entitled &quot;&quot;, written by Amanda Coe. Julie Walters played Whitehouse, Alun Armstrong played her husband, Ernest, and Hugh Bonneville played Greene.

Her favourite programmes were &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (winner of NVALA&#x27;s Best Family Viewing Award in 1967), &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and coverage of snooker. She had privately expressed gratitude to Dennis Potter and the BBC for his television play &quot;Where Adam Stood&quot; in 1976.

In 1984 the NVALA gave an award to Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, writers of the situation comedy &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and Thatcher, who had declared the show her favourite programme, presented the award. Whitehouse sat laughing next to Thatcher as the Prime Minister acted out a sketch, written principally by her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, alongside a reluctant Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne, the lead actors in the programme. In accepting the award, Lynn thanked Whitehouse and the NVALA and congratulated Thatcher for &quot;taking her rightful place in the world of situation comedy&quot;.

In 1989 a sketch comedy show began on BBC Radio 1 called &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, starring alternative comedians David Baddiel, Rob Newman, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. The title was an oblique reference to Whitehouse&#x27;s campaigning against her perception of declining values on TV and radio, although she was rarely satirised directly. The show later transferred to television and made household names of its four protagonists.

In 2017, in episode 15 of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, &quot;Canticle&quot;, the character Mrs Pettibon is loosely based on Mary Whitehouse.

The two-part BBC Two documentary &quot;Banned! The Mary Whitehouse Story&quot;, shown in March and April 2022, looks back on Whitehouse&#x27;s life. It features contributions from Gyles Brandreth, Michael Grade, Beatrix Campbell, Ken Loach, Peter Bradshaw, Ben Thompson, Peter Tatchell and David Sullivan.

<text>The Ustaše (), also known by anglicised versions Ustasha or Ustashe, was a Croatian fascist and ultranationalist organization active, as one organization, between 1929 and 1945, formally known as the Ustaša – Croatian Revolutionary Movement (). From its inception and before the Second World War, the organization engaged in a series of terrorist activities against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including collaborating with IMRO to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1934. During World War II in Yugoslavia, the Ustaše went on to perpetrate the Holocaust and genocide against its Jewish, Serb and Roma populations, killing hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Roma, as well as Muslim and Croat political dissidents.

The ideology of the movement was a blend of fascism, Roman Catholicism and Croatian ultranationalism. The Ustaše supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span the Drina River and extend to the border of Belgrade. The movement advocated a racially &quot;pure&quot; Croatia and promoted genocide against Serbs—due to the Ustaše&#x27;s anti-Serb sentiment—and Holocaust against Jews and Roma via Nazi racial theory, and persecution of anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosniaks. The Ustaše viewed the Bosniaks as &quot;Muslim Croats&quot;, and as a result, Bosniaks were not persecuted on the basis of race. The Ustaše espoused Roman Catholicism and Islam as the religions of the Croats and condemned Orthodox Christianity, which was the main religion of the Serbs. Roman Catholicism was identified with Croatian nationalism, while Islam, which had a large following in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was praised by the Ustaše as the religion that &quot;keeps true the blood of Croats.&quot;

It was founded as a nationalist organization that sought to create an independent Croatian state. It functioned as a terrorist organization before World War II. After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Ustaše came to power when they were appointed to rule a part of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a quasi-protectorate puppet state established by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Ustaše Militia () became its military wing in the new state.

The Ustaše regime was militarily weak and failed to ever attain significant support among Croats. Therefore, terror was their means of controlling the &quot;ethnically disparate&quot; population. The Ustaše regime was initially backed by some parts of the Croat population that in the interwar period had felt oppressed by the Serb-led Yugoslavia, but their brutal policies quickly alienated many ordinary Croats and resulted in a loss of the support they had gained by creating a Croatian national state. 

With the German surrender, end of World War II in Europe, and the establishment of socialist Yugoslavia in 1945, the Ustaše movement and their state totally collapsed. Many members of the Ustaše militia and Croatian Home Guard who subsequently fled the country were taken as prisoners of war and subjected to forced marches and executions during the Bleiburg repatriations. Various underground and exile successor organisations created by former Ustaše members, such as the Crusaders and the Croatian Liberation Movement, tried to continue the movement to little success.

==Name==
The word &quot;ustaša&quot; (plural: &quot;ustaše&quot;) is derived from the intransitive verb &quot;ustati&quot; (Croatian for &quot;rise up&quot;). &quot;&quot; () was a military rank in the Imperial Croatian Home Guard (1868–1918). The same term was the name of Croatian third-class infantry regiments () during World War I (1914–1918). Another variation of the word &quot;ustati&quot; is &quot;ustanik&quot; (plural: &quot;ustanici&quot;) which means an insurgent, or a rebel. The name &quot;ustaša&quot; did not have fascist connotations during the early years of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the term &quot;ustat&quot; was itself used in Herzegovina to denote the insurgents from the Herzegovinian rebellion of 1875. The full original name of the organization appeared in April 1931 as the or UHRO (Ustaša – Croatian Revolutionary Organization). In 1933 it was renamed the (Ustaša – Croatian Revolutionary Movement), a name it kept until World War II. In English, Ustasha, Ustashe, Ustashas and Ustashi are used for the movement or its members.

==Ideology==
===Ideological roots===

One of the major ideological influences on the Croatian nationalism of the Ustaše was 19th century Croatian activist Ante Starčević, an advocate of Croatian unity and independence, who was both anti-Habsburg and anti-Serbian in outlook.

He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks, Serbs, and Slovenes, considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Orthodox Christianity, and considered the Slovenes &quot;mountain Croats&quot;. Starčević argued that the large Serb presence in territories claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement, encouraged by Habsburg rulers, and the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs. Starčević admired Bosniaks because in his view they were Croats who had adopted Islam in order to preserve the economic and political autonomy of Bosnia and Croatia under the Ottoman occupation.

The Ustaše used Starčević&#x27;s theories to promote their own annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia and recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components: Catholics and Muslims. The Ustaše sought to represent Starčević as being connected to their views. Josip Frank seceded his extreme fraction from Starčević&#x27;s Party of Rights and formed his own, the Pure Party of Rights, which became the main pool of members of the subsequent Ustaše movement. Historian John Paul Newman stated that Austro-Hungarian officers&#x27; &quot;unfaltering opposition to Yugoslavia provided a blueprint for the Croatian radical right, the Ustaše&quot;.

The Ustaše promoted the theories of Milan Šufflay, who is believed to have claimed that Croatia had been &quot;one of the strongest ramparts of Western civilization for many centuries&quot;, which he claimed had been lost through its union with Serbia when the nation of Yugoslavia was formed in 1918. Šufflay was killed in Zagreb in 1931 by government supporters.

The Ustaše accepted the 1935 thesis of Krunoslav Draganović, a Catholic priest who claimed that many Catholics in southern Herzegovina had been converted to Orthodox Christianity in the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to justify their own policy of forcible conversion of Orthodox Christians to Catholicism.

The Ustaše were heavily influenced by Nazism and fascism. Its leader, Ante Pavelić, held the position of &quot;Poglavnik&quot;, which was based on the similar positions of &quot;Duce&quot; held by Benito Mussolini and &quot;Führer&quot; held by Adolf Hitler. The Ustaše, like fascists, promoted a corporatist economy. Pavelić and the Ustaše were allowed sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini after being exiled from Yugoslavia. Pavelić had been in negotiations with Fascist Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia. The Ustaše ideology has also been characterized as clerical fascism by several authors, who emphasize the importance the movement attached to Roman Catholicism.

Mussolini&#x27;s support of the Ustaše was based on pragmatic considerations, such as maximizing Italian influence in the Balkans and the Adriatic. After 1937, with the weakening of French influence in Europe following Germany&#x27;s remilitarization of the Rhineland and with the rise of a quasi-fascist government in Yugoslavia under Milan Stojadinović, Mussolini abandoned support for the Ustaše from 1937 to 1939 and sought to improve relations with Yugoslavia, fearing that continued hostility towards Yugoslavia would result in Yugoslavia entering Germany&#x27;s sphere of influence.
The collapse of the quasi-fascist Stojadinović regime resulted in Italy restoring its support for the Ustaše, whose aim was to create an independent Croatia in personal union with Italy. However, distrust of the Ustaše grew. Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law and Italian foreign minister Count Galeazzo Ciano noted in his diary that &quot;The Duce is indignant with Pavelić, because he claims that the Croats are descendants of the Goths. This will have the effect of bringing them into the German orbit&quot;.

Hungary strongly supported the Ustaše for two aims. One, in order to weaken Yugoslavia, Little Entente, in order to ultimately regain some of its lost territories. The other, Hungary also wished to establish later in the future a strong alliance with the Independent State of Croatia and possibly enter a personal union.

Nazi Germany initially didn&#x27;t support an independent Croatia, nor did it support the Ustaše, with Hitler stressing the importance of a &quot;strong and united Yugoslavia&quot;. Nazi officials, including Hermann Göring, wanted Yugoslavia stable and officially neutral during the war so Germany could continue to securely gain Yugoslavia&#x27;s raw material exports. The Nazis grew irritated with the Ustaše, among them Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, who was dissatisfied with the lack of full compliance by the NDH to the Nazis&#x27; agenda of extermination of the Jews, as the Ustaše permitted Jews who converted to Catholicism to be recognized as &quot;honorary Croats&quot;, thus putatively exempt from persecution.

===Political programme and main agendas===
In 1932, an editorial in the first issue of the &quot;Ustaše&quot; newspaper, signed by the Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić, proclaimed that violence and terror would be the main means for the Ustaše to attain their goals:The KNIFE, REVOLVER, MACHINE GUN and TIME BOMB; these are the idols, these are bells that will announce the dawning and THE RESURRECTION OF THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF CROATIA.

In 1933, the Ustaše presented &quot;The Seventeen Principles&quot; that formed the official ideology of the movement. The Principles stated the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights and declared that people who were not Croat by &quot;blood&quot; would be excluded from political life.

Those considered &quot;undesirables&quot; were subjected to mass murder. These principles called for the creation of a new economic system that would be neither capitalist nor communist and which would emphasize the importance of the Roman Catholic Church and the patriarchial family as means to maintain social order and morality. (The name given by modern historians to this particular aspect of Ustaše ideology varies; &quot;national Catholicism&quot;, &quot;political Catholicism&quot; and &quot;Catholic Croatism&quot; have been proposed among others.) In power, the Ustaše banned contraception and tightened laws against blasphemy.
The Ustaše accepted that Croats are part of the Dinaric race, but rejected the idea that Croats are primarily Slavic, claiming they primarily come from Germanic roots with the Goths. The Ustaše believed that a government must naturally be strong and authoritarian. The movement opposed parliamentary democracy for being &quot;corrupt&quot; and Marxism and Bolshevism for interfering in family life and the economy and for their materialism. The Ustaše considered competing political parties and elected parliaments to be harmful to its own interests.

The Ustaše recognized both Roman Catholicism and Islam as national religions of the Croatian people but initially rejected Orthodox Christianity as being incompatible with their objectives. Although the Ustaše emphasized religious themes, it stressed that duty to the nation took precedence over religious custom.

In power, the Ustaše banned the use of the term &quot;Serbian Orthodox faith&quot;, requiring &quot;Greek-Eastern faith&quot; in its place. The Ustaše forcefully converted many Orthodox to Catholicism, murdered and expelled 85% of Orthodox priests, and plundered and burnt many Orthodox Christian churches. The Ustaše also persecuted Old Catholics who did not recognize papal infallibility. On 2 July 1942 the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded, as a further means to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, but this new church gained very few followers and was abolished in 1945.

=== Antisemitism ===
While initial focus was against Serbs, as the Ustaše grew closer to the Nazis they adopted antisemitism. In 1936, in &quot;The Croat Question&quot;, Ante Pavelić placed Jews third among &quot;the Enemies of the Croats&quot; (after Serbs and Freemasons, but before Communists): writing:″Today, practically all finance and nearly all commerce in Croatia is in Jewish hands. This became possible only through the support of the state, which thereby seeks, on one hand, to strengthen the pro-Serbian Jews, and on the other, to weaken Croat national strength. The Jews celebrated the establishment of the so-called Yugoslav state with great joy, because a national Croatia could never be as useful to them as a multi-national Yugoslavia; for in national chaos lies the power of the Jews... In fact, as the Jews had foreseen, Yugoslavia became, in consequence of the corruption of official life in Serbia, a true Eldorado of Jewry.&quot;

Once in power, the Ustaše immediately introduced a series of Nazi-style racial laws. On 30 April 1941, the Ustaše proclaimed the &quot;Legal Decree on Racial Origins&quot;, the &quot;Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honor of the Croatian People&quot;, and the &quot;Legal Provision on Citizenship&quot;. These decrees defined who was a Jew, and took away the citizenship rights of all non-Aryans, i.e. Jews and Roma. By the end of April 1941, months before the Nazis implemented similar measures in Germany and over a year after they were implemented in occupied Poland, the Ustaše required all Jews to wear insignia, typically a yellow Star of David. The Ustaše declared the &quot;Legal Provision on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies&quot;, on 10 October 1941, and with it they confiscated all Jewish property.

Already on their first day, 10–11 April 1941, Ustaše arrested a group of prominent Zagreb Jews and held them for ransom. On 13 April the same was done in Osijek, where Ustaše and Volksdeutscher mobs also destroyed the synagogue and Jewish graveyard. This process was repeated multiple times in 1941 with groups of Jews. Simultaneously, the Ustaše initiated extensive antisemitic propaganda, with Ustaše papers writing that Croatians must &quot;be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity, ... We need to keep our blood clean of the Jews&quot;. They also wrote that Jews are synonymous with &quot;treachery, cheating, greed, immorality and foreigness&quot;, and therefore &quot;wide swaths of the Croatian people always despised the Jews and felt towards them natural revulsion&quot;.

In May 1941, the Ustaše rounded up 165 Jewish youth in Zagreb, members of the Jewish sports club Makabi, and sent them to the Danica concentration camp. All but three were later killed by the Ustaše. The Ustaše sent most Jews to Ustaše and Nazi concentration camps—including the notorious, Ustaše-run Jasenovac concentration camp—where nearly 32,000, or 80% of the Jews in the Independent State of Croatia, were killed. In October 1941, the Ustaše mayor of Zagreb ordered the demolition of the Zagreb Synagogue, which was completely demolished by April 1942. The Ustaše persecuted Jews who practiced Judaism but authorized Jewish converts to Catholicism to be recognized as Croatian citizens and be given honorary Aryan citizenship that allowed them to be reinstated at the jobs from which they had previously been separated. After they stripped Jews of their citizenship rights, the Ustaše allowed some to apply for Aryan rights via bribes and/or through connections to prominent Ustaše. The whole process was highly arbitrary. Only 2% of Zagreb&#x27;s Jews were granted Aryan rights, for example. Also, Aryan rights did not guarantee permanent protection from being sent to concentration camps or other persecution.

===Views on Muslims===
Islam, which had a large following in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was praised by the Ustaše as the religion that &quot;keeps true the blood of Croats.&quot; The Ustaše viewed the Bosniaks as &quot;Muslim Croats&quot;, and as a result, they were not persecuted on the basis of race. That being said, Muslims were not free from persecution and atrocities by the Ustaše, even if not on the basis of religion or ethnicity. The majority of Muslims preferred a return to autonomy under Habsburg rule. Most Muslims were reportedly either neutral or opposed to the Ustaše regime. Despite Pavelić’s promises of equality between Catholics and Muslims, many Muslims became dissatisfied with Croat rule. Muslims (Bosniaks) comprised approximately 12% of the civil service and armed forces of the NDH.

=== Other measures ===

Economically, the Ustaše supported the creation of a corporatist economy. The movement believed that natural rights existed to private property and ownership over small-scale means of production free from state control. Armed struggle, revenge and terrorism were glorified by the Ustaše.

The Ustaše introduced widespread measures, to which many Croats themselves fell victim. Jozo Tomasevich in his book &quot;War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941–1945&quot;, states that &quot;never before in history had Croats been exposed to such legalized administrative, police and judicial brutality and abuse as during the Ustaša regime.&quot; Decrees enacted by the regime formed the basis that allowed it to get rid of all unwanted employees in state and local government and in state enterprises, the &quot;unwanted&quot; being all Jews, Serbs and Yugoslav-oriented Croats who were all thrown out except for some deemed specifically needed by the government. This would leave a multitude of jobs to be filled by Ustašes and pro-Ustaše adherents and would lead to government jobs being filled by people with no professional qualifications.

==History==
===Before World War II===
During the 1920s, Ante Pavelić, lawyer, politician and one of the followers of Josip Frank&#x27;s Pure Party of Rights, became the leading advocate of Croatian independence. In 1927, he secretly contacted Benito Mussolini, dictator of Italy and founder of fascism, and presented his separatist ideas to him. Pavelić proposed an independent Greater Croatia that should cover the entire historical and ethnic area of the Croats. Historian Rory Yeomans claimed that as early as 1928, there were signs that Pavelić was considering the formation of a nationalist insurgency group.

In October 1928, after the assassination of leading Croatian politician Stjepan Radić, (Croatian Peasant Party President in the Yugoslav Assembly) by radical Montenegrin politician Puniša Račić, a youth group named the Croat Youth Movement was founded by Branimir Jelić at the University of Zagreb. A year later Ante Pavelić was invited by the 21-year-old Jelić into the organization as a junior member. A related movement, the Domobranski Pokret—which had been the name of the legal Croatian army in Austria-Hungary—began publication of &quot;Hrvatski Domobran&quot;, a newspaper dedicated to Croatian national matters. The Ustaše sent &quot;Hrvatski Domobran&quot; to the United States to garner support for them from Croatian-Americans. The organization around the &quot;Domobran&quot; tried to engage with and radicalize moderate Croats, using Radić&#x27;s assassination to stir up emotions within the divided country. By 1929 two divergent Croatian political streams had formed: those who supported Pavelić&#x27;s view that only violence could secure Croatia&#x27;s national interests, and the Croatian Peasant Party, led then by Vladko Maček, successor to Stjepan Radić, which had much greater support among Croats.

Various members of the Croatian Party of Rights contributed to the writing of the &quot;Domobran&quot;, until around Christmas 1928 when the newspaper was banned by authorities of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In January 1929 the king banned all national parties, and the radical wing of the Party of Rights was exiled, including Pavelić, Jelić and Gustav Perčec. This group was later joined by several other Croatian exiles. On 22 March 1929, Zvonimir Pospišil, Mijo Babić, Marko Hranilović, and Matija Soldin murdered Toni Šlegel, the chief editor of newspaper &quot;Novosti&quot; from Zagreb and president of &quot;Jugoštampa&quot;, which was the beginning of the terrorist actions of Ustaše. Hranilović and Soldin were both arrested and executed for the murder. On 20 April 1929 Pavelić and others co-signed a declaration in Sofia, Bulgaria, with members of the Macedonian National Committee, asserting that they would pursue &quot;their legal activities for the establishment of human and national rights, political freedom and complete independence for both Croatia and Macedonia&quot;. The Court for the Preservation of the State in Belgrade sentenced Pavelić and Perčec to death on 17 July 1929.

The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the Croatian diaspora in Europe, as well as North and South America. In January 1932 they named their revolutionary organization &quot;Ustaša&quot;. The Ustaše carried out terrorist acts, to cause as much damage as possible to Yugoslavia. From their training camps in fascist Italy and Hungary, they planted time bombs on international trains bound for Yugoslavia, causing deaths and material damage. In November 1932 ten Ustaše, led by Andrija Artuković and supported by four local sympathizers, attacked a gendarme outpost at Brušani in the Lika/Velebit area, in an apparent attempt to intimidate the Yugoslav authorities. The incident has sometimes been termed the &quot;Velebit uprising&quot;. 

====Assassination of King Alexander I====

The Ustaše&#x27;s most infamous terrorist act was carried out on 9 October 1934, when working with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), they assassinated King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France. The perpetrator, a Bulgarian revolutionary, Vlado Chernozemski, was killed by French police. Three Ustaše members who had been waiting at different locations for the king—Mijo Kralj, Zvonimir Pospišil and Milan Rajić—were captured and sentenced to life imprisonment by a French court. Following the German invasion of France, the men were released from prison.

Ante Pavelić, along with Eugen Kvaternik and Ivan Perčević, were subsequently sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by a French court, as the real organizers of the deed. The Ustaše believed that the assassination of King Alexander had effectively &quot;broken the backbone of Yugoslavia&quot; and that it was their &quot;most important achievement.&quot;

Soon after the assassination, all organizations related to the Ustaše as well as the &quot;Hrvatski Domobran&quot;, which continued as a civil organization, were banned throughout Europe. Under pressure from France, the Italian police arrested Pavelić and several Ustaše emigrants in October 1934. Pavelić was imprisoned in Turin and released in March 1936. After he met with Eugen Dido Kvaternik, he stated that assassination was &quot;the only language Serbs understand&quot;. While in prison, Pavelić was informed of the 1935 election in Yugoslavia, when the coalition led by Croat Vladko Maček won. He stated that his victory was aided by the activity of Ustaše. By the mid-1930s, graffiti with the initials &quot;ŽAP&quot; meaning &quot;Long live Ante Pavelić&quot; () had begun to appear on the streets of Zagreb. During the 1930s, a split developed between the &quot;home&quot; &quot;Ustaše&quot; members who stayed behind in Croatia and Bosnia to struggle against Yugoslavia and the &quot;emigre&quot; &quot;Ustaše&quot; who went abroad. The &quot;emigre&quot; &quot;Ustaše&quot; who had a much lower educational level were viewed as violent, ignorant and fanatical by the &quot;home&quot; &quot;Ustaše&quot; while the &quot;home&quot; &quot;Ustaše&quot; were dismissed as &quot;soft&quot; by the &quot;emigres&quot; who saw themselves as a &quot;warrior-elite&quot;.

After March 1937, when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a pact of friendship, Ustaše and their activities had been banned, which attracted the attention of young Croats, especially university students, who would become sympathizers or members. In 1936, the Yugoslav government offered amnesty to those &quot;Ustaše&quot; abroad provided they promised to renounce violence; many of the &quot;emigres&quot; accepted the amnesty.  In the late 1930s, the &quot;Ustaše&quot; started to infiltrate the para-military organizations of the Croat Peasant Party, the Croatian Defense Force and the Peasant Civil Party. At the University of Zagreb, an &quot;Ustaše&quot;-linked student group become the largest single student group by 1939. In February 1939 two returnees from detention, Mile Budak and Ivan Oršanić, became editors of the pro-Ustaše journal &quot;Hrvatski narod&quot;, known in English as &quot;The Croatian Nation&quot;.

===World War II===
The Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Vladko Maček, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), which was the most influential party in Croatia at the time, rejected German offers to lead the new government. On 10 April the most senior home-based Ustaše, Slavko Kvaternik, took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia (&quot;Nezavisna Država Hrvatska&quot;, NDH). The name of the state was an attempt to capitalise on the Croat struggle for independence. Maček issued a statement that day, calling on all Croatians to cooperate with the new authorities.
Meanwhile, Pavelić and several hundred Ustaše left their camps in Italy for Zagreb, where he declared a new government on 16 April 1941. He accorded himself the title of &quot;Poglavnik&quot;—a Croatian approximation to &quot;Führer&quot;. The Independent State of Croatia was declared on Croatian &quot;ethnic and historical territory&quot;, what is today Republic of Croatia (without Istria), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Syrmia and the Bay of Kotor. However, a few days after the declaration of independence, the Ustaše were forced to sign the Treaty of Rome where they surrendered part of Dalmatia and Krk, Rab, Korčula, Biograd, Šibenik, Split, Čiovo, Šolta, Mljet and part of Konavle and the Bay of Kotor to Italy. &quot;De facto&quot; control over this territory varied for the majority of the war, as the Yugoslav Partisans grew more successful, while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of interest. The Germans and Italians split the NDH into two zones of influence, one in the southwest controlled by the Italians and the other in the northeast controlled by the Germans. As a result, the NDH has been described as &quot;an Italian-German quasi-protectorate&quot;. In September 1943, after Italian capitulation, the NDH re-occupied the whole territory which had been annexed by Italy according to Treaty of Rome.

The decline in support for the Ustaše regime among ethnic Croats of those initially for the government began with the ceding of Dalmatia to Italy, considered as the heartland of the state and worsened with the internal lawlessness from Ustaše persecutions.

====Ustaše militia====

The Army of the Independent State of Croatia was composed of enlistees who did not participate in Ustaše activities. The Ustaše Militia was organised in 1941 into five (later 15) 700-man battalions, two railway security battalions and the elite Black Legion and Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion (later Brigade). They were predominantly recruited among uneducated population and working class.

On 27 April 1941 a newly formed unit of the Ustaše army killed members of the largely Serbian community of Gudovac, near Bjelovar. Eventually all who opposed and/or threatened the Ustaše were outlawed. The HSS was banned on 11 June 1941, in an attempt by the Ustaše to take their place as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry. Vladko Maček was sent to the Jasenovac concentration camp, but later released to serve a house arrest sentence due to his popularity among the people. Maček was later again called upon by foreigners to take a stand and oppose the Pavelić government, but refused. In early 1941 Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb.

In the months after Independent State of Croatia has been established, most of Ustaše groups were not under centralized control: besides 4,500 regular Ustaše Corps troops, there was some 25,000–30,0000 &quot;Wild Ustaše&quot; (hrv. &quot;divlje ustaše&quot;), boosted by government-controlled press as &quot;peasant Ustaše&quot; &quot;begging&quot; to be sent to fight enemies of the regime. After mass crimes against Serb populace committed during the summer months of 1941, the regime decided to blame all the atrocities to the irregular Ustaše—thoroughly undisciplined and paid for the service only with the booty; authorities even sentenced to death and executed publicly in August and September 1941 many of them for unauthorized use of extreme violence against Serbs and Gypsies. To put an end to Wild Ustaše uncontrolled looting and killing, the central government used some 6,000 gendarmes and some 45,000 newly recruited members of regular &quot;Domobranstvo&quot; forces.
Pavelić first met with Adolf Hitler on 6 June 1941. Mile Budak, then a minister in Pavelić&#x27;s government, publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941. Vjekoslav &quot;Maks&quot; Luburić, a chief of the secret police, started building concentration camps in the summer of the same year. Ustaše activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led the Italians and the Germans to express their disquiet. According to writer/historian Srđa Trifković, as early as 10 July 1941 Wehrmacht Gen. Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW):Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation. .. I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Ustaše crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, I could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.

Historian Jonathan Steinberg describes Ustaše crimes against Serbian and Jewish civilians: &quot;Serbian and Jewish men, women and children were literally hacked to death&quot;. Reflecting on the photos of Ustaše crimes taken by Italians, Steinberg writes: &quot;There are photographs of Serbian women with breasts hacked off by pocket knives, men with eyes gouged out, emasculated and mutilated&quot;.

A Gestapo report to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated 17 February 1942, stated:

In September 1942 an Ustaše Defensive Brigade was formed, and during 1943 the Ustaše battalions were re-organised into eight four-battalion brigades (1st to 8th). In 1943 the Germans suffered major losses on the Eastern Front and the Italians signed an armistice with the Allies, leaving behind significant caches of arms which the Partisans would use.
By 1944 Pavelić was almost totally reliant on Ustaše units, now 100,000 strong, formed in Brigades 1 to 20, Recruit Training Brigades 21 to 24, three divisions, two railway brigades, one defensive brigade and the new Mobile Brigade. In November 1944 the army was effectively put under Ustaše control when the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia were combined with the units of the Ustaše to form 18 divisions, comprising 13 infantry, two mountain and two assault divisions and one replacement division, each with its own organic artillery and other support units. There were several armored units.

Fighting continued for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945, as Pavelić ordered the NDH forces to attempt to escape to Austria, together with a large number of civilians. The Battle of Poljana, between a mixed German and Ustaše column and a Partisan force, was the last battle of World War II on European soil. Most of those fleeing, including both Ustaše and civilians, were handed over to the Partisans at Bleiburg and elsewhere on the Austrian border. Pavelić hid in Austria and Rome, with the help of Catholic clergy, later fleeing to Argentina.

===After the war===

After World War II, many of the Ustaše went underground or fled to countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany and some countries in South America, notably Argentina, with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their own grassroots supporters.

For several years some Ustaše tried to organize a resistance group called the Crusaders, but their efforts were largely foiled by the Yugoslav authorities. With the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia, the active movement went dormant. Infighting fragmented the surviving Ustaše. Pavelić formed the Croatian Liberation Movement, which drew in several of the former state&#x27;s leaders. Vjekoslav Vrančić founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement and was its leader. Maks Luburić formed the Croatian National Resistance. Branimir Jelić founded the Croatian National Committee. Former Crusader and Ustaša mobile police officer, Srecko Rover, helped establish Ustaše groups in Australia.

Blagoje Jovović, a Montenegrin, shot Pavelić near Buenos Aires on 9 April 1957; Pavelić later died of his injuries.

==Ethnic and religious persecution==

The Ustaše intended to create an ethnically &quot;pure&quot; Croatia, and they viewed the Serbs living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as the biggest obstacle to this goal. Ustaše ministers Mile Budak, and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustaše policy was an ethnically pure Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal was:

# One third of the Serbs were to be killed
# One third of the Serbs were to be expelled
# One third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to Catholicism

The NDH government cooperated with Nazi Germany in the Holocaust and exercised their own version of the genocide against Serbs, Jews and Roma (aka &quot;gypsies&quot;) inside its borders. State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan Žanić, a minister of the NDH Legislative council, on 2 May 1941:
This country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity.

The Ustaše enacted race laws patterned after those of the Third Reich, which persecuted Jews, Romani and Serbs, who were collectively declared to be enemies of the Croatian people. Serbs, Jews, Roma and Croatian and Bosniak dissidents, including Communists, were interned in concentration camps, the largest of which was Jasenovac. By the end of the war the Ustaše, under Pavelić&#x27;s leadership, had killed an estimated 30,000 Jews and 26,000–29,000 Roma, while the number of Serb victims ranges as low as 200,000 to as high as 500,000 with historians generally listing between 300,000 and 350,000 deaths.

The history textbooks in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cited 700,000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac. This was promulgated from a 1946 calculation of the demographic loss of population (the difference between the actual number of people after the war and the number that would have been, had the pre-war growth trend continued). After that, it was used by Edvard Kardelj and Moša Pijade in the Yugoslav war reparations claim sent to Germany. In its entry on Jasenovac, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum says:
Determining the number of victims is highly problematic, due to the destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism, which has been and remains influenced by ethnic tension, religious prejudice, and ideological conflict. The Ustaše murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Ustaša rule; more than 30,000 Croatian Jews were killed either in Croatia or at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The USHMM notes that estimates on the number of Serb victims, the Ustaše&#x27;s primary victims, vary tremendously and that &quot;the most reliable figures place the number between 330,000 and 390,000, with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac.&quot;

The Jasenovac Memorial Area maintains a list of 83,145 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964, as well as names and biographical data for the victims identified in recent inquiries. As the gathering process was imperfect, they estimated that the list represented between 60%–75% of the total victims, putting the number of killed in that complex at between roughly 80,000–100,000. The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians Vladimir Žerjavić and Bogoljub Kočović were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Kočović, and 530,000 according to Žerjavić, out of a total of 1.014 million or 1.027 million deaths (respectively). Žerjavić further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.

The Belgrade Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulajić, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During World War II various German military commanders and civilian authorities gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed inside the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. Historian Prof. Jozo Tomasevich has posited that some of these figures may have been a &quot;deliberate exaggeration&quot; fostered to create further hostility between Serbs and Croats so that they would not unite in resisting the Axis. These figures included 400,000 Serbs (Alexander Löhr); 500,000 Serbs (Lothar Rendulic); 250,000 to March 1943 (Edmund Glaise von Horstenau); more than &quot;3/4 of a million Serbs&quot; (Hermann Neubacher) in 1943; 600,000–700,000 in concentration camps until March 1944 (Ernst Fick); 700,000 (Massenbach).

===Concentration camps===


The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941. These included:
* Danica near Koprivnica
* Slana and Metajna on the Island of Pag
* Jadovno near Gospić
* Kruščica near Vitez and Travnik in Bosnia
* Đakovo
* Loborgrad in Zagorje
* Tenja near Osijek

These camps were closed by October 1942. The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Bročica, were closed in November 1941. The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war:
* Ciglana (Jasenovac III)
* Kozara (Jasenovac IV)
* Stara Gradiška (Jasenovac V) – concentration camp for women and children

There were also other camps in:
* Sisak concentration camp
* Jastrebarsko Children&#x27;s Concentration Camp
* Gospić
* Kerestinec prison near Zagreb
* Lepoglava near Varaždin

Numbers of prisoners:
* between 300,000 and 350,000 up to 700,000 in Jasenovac (disputed)
* around 35,000 in Gospić
* around 8,500 in Pag
* around 3,000 in Đakovo
* 1,018 in Jastrebarsko
* around 1,000 in Lepoglava

=== Massacres of Serb civilians ===
Beyond mass killings in concentration camps, the Ustaše perpetrated many massacres of civilians in the field. The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on 30 April 1941, when the Ustaše rounded up and killed 196 Serb villagers at Gudovac. Many other massacres soon followed, including at Blagaj, Glina, Korita, Nevesinje, Prebilovci, Metkovic, Otočac, Vočin, Šargovac, etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, Alojzije Mišić, described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of Herzegovina, just during the first 6 months of the war:People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Baljić, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and Čapljina to the Šurmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.

==== German accounts of Ustaše massacres ====
German officers in Croatia and Bosnia repeatedly expressed abhorrence at Ustaše mass killings of Serbs, using words like &quot;slaughter&quot;, &quot;atrocities&quot;, &quot;butchery&quot; and &quot;terror&quot;, while citing hundreds of thousands of victims. Thus Major Walter Kleinenberger, officer with the 714th division, complained that Ustaše brutality &quot;was in defiance of all laws of civilization. The Ustaše murder without exception men, women and children&quot;. German Captain Konopatzki called the Ustaše Black Legion slaughter of Serb civilians in Eastern Bosnia &quot;a new wave of butchery of innocents&quot;. Ustaše &quot;wholesale butchery&quot; (Abschlachtung) of Serbs in Srem, in ISC-occupied Serbia, triggered German concerns of Serb uprisings. Lieutenant Colonel von Wedel wrote that in western Bosnia Ustaše killed women and children &quot;like cattle&quot; in a series of &quot;bestial executions&quot;. This is how Hitler&#x27;s Plenipotentiary to Croatia, General von Horstanau, described the aftermath of slaughter committed by Jasenovac concentration camp guards in a nearby village:

: At Crkveni Bok, an unfortunate place, over which about five hundred 15- to 20-year-old thugs descended under the leadership of an Ustasha lieutenant colonel, people were killed everywhere, women were raped and then tortured to death, children were killed. I saw in the Sava River the corpse of a young woman with her eyes dug out and a stake driven into her sexual parts. This woman was at most twenty years old when she fell into the hands of these monsters. All around, pigs devoured unburied human beings. &quot;Fortunate&quot; residents were shipped in terrifying freight cars; many of these involuntary &quot;passengers&quot; cut their veins during transport to the camp [Jasenovac]&quot;

The German military even took the extraordinary step of trying the Ustaše chaplain, Miroslav Filipović, for the massacre of 2,300 civilians in 3 villages around Banja Luka in February 1942, including 52 children at a school. On March 3, 1943, General von Horstanau, wrote &quot;Thus far 250,000 Serbs have been killed&quot;. General Lothar Rendulić wrote how in August 1942 he remarked to an Ustaše official that he could not conceive how 500,000 Serbs had been killed, to which the Ustaše replied &quot;Half-a-million is a slanderous accusation, the number is not higher than 200,000&quot;. Other German sources put the total Serb victim numbers in the ISC, as high as 600,000 to 700,000.

=== Religious persecution ===
As part of their policy to eliminate Serbs entirely, by killing one-third, converting one-third and expelling one-third, the Ustaše conducted forcible conversions of Christian Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism, with the participation of Catholic priests. On occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at Glina. On 18 May 1943, Archbishop Stepinac wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240,000 conversions to date. The Ustaše killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo), while they jailed and tortured the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb. The Ustaše expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.

According to NDH laws only uneducated Serbs were eligible for conversion to Catholicism; educated people (merchants, intelligentia, and especially Orthodox clergy) were to be exterminated or expelled.

Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Ustaše, in order to &quot;leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Ustašas&#x27; policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out&quot;. The Ustaše destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox churches, forbade the use of the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both officially used by the Serbian Orthodox Church), even prohibiting the term &quot;Serbian Orthodox Church&quot;. Orthodox schools were shut down, and the Church was prohibited from collecting donations from believers, robbing it of income. Church properties were confiscated, some being turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Ustaše tried to create its own alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian hieromonk, Germogen Maximov, reigning as &quot;patriarch&quot;, but it failed to gain adherents.

Despite these many actions by the Ustaše to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the historian Jozo Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Ustaše attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church &quot;was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests&quot;, and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican &quot;regarded Ustaše policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism&quot;.

==Connections with the Catholic Church==

The historian Mark Biondich observes that the Catholic Church had historically been on the fringes of Croatian politics and public life, and that Church influence had further eroded during the interwar period due to the royal dictatorship and the popularity of the anti-clerical Croatian Peasant Party. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: &quot;... a massive press campaign was launched to mobilize Croatia&#x27;s nearly three million Catholics against the central government&#x27;s measures penalizing Saint Peter&#x27;s apostolate. First of all its inequality in treatment was denounced: &#x27;the budget for religion totals 141 million dinars, 70 of which go to the Serbian Church, and 34 to the Catholic one.(...) Pašić&#x27;s government is kind in Serbia, where each citizen pays 55 dinars in yearly taxes, while it is cruel in Croatia and Slovenia, largely Catholic districts, where each citizen pays 165 dinars in taxes.&#x27;&quot;

Croatian Catholic Church antagonism toward the Orthodox Church became an important part of Ustaše antagonism toward Serbs, with fateful consequences during the war. The Ustaše supported violent aggression or force to convert Serbo-Croatian speaking Orthodox believers to Roman Catholicism. The Ustaše held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy, as a symbol of Serbian nationalism, was their greatest foe and never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia—they recognized only &quot;Croats of the Eastern faith&quot;. Under the Ustaše policy of eliminating Serbs, the Catholic Church in Croatia participated in the forced conversion of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. However, even conversion did not necessarily protect Serbs and Jews from slaughter. Bishop Alojzije Mišić of Mostar described how while Serb converts to Catholicism &quot;were at Church attending holy Mass, they (Ustaše) seized them, the young and the old, men and women, drove them like cattle...and soon sent them to eternity, &quot;en masse&quot;.&quot;

The Ustaše called Bosniaks &quot;Croats of the Islamic faith&quot; and in general tolerated Muslims; in turn the Bosniak community did not demonstrate any particular hostility to the Ustaše government. Many Muslim conscripts served in the armed forces of Independent State of Croatia, or in its police forces; only a very small number of Muslims served in the ranks of the communist Partisans until the closing days of the war. The October 12, 1941, Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims by 108 notable Muslims condemned Ustaše atrocities against Serbs.

On 28 April 1941, the head of the Catholic Church in Croatia, Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, issued a public letter in support of the new Independent State of Croatia (under Ustaše-led government), and asked the clergy to pray for its leader, Ante Pavelić. This despite the fact that the Ustaše had already proclaimed measures prohibiting Serbs, Jews and Gipsies to serve as policemen, judges and soldiers, and making easy for the state officials to fire members of those ethnic/religious groups from the public administration, and he knew they were preparing Nazi-style racial laws, which Pavelić signed only 2 days after.

While Stepinac later objected to certain Ustaše policies and helped some Jews and Serbs, he continued to publicly support the survival of Independent State of Croatia until its very end, served as the state&#x27;s War Vicar, and in 1944 received a medal from Pavelić. During the ongoing war, Stepinac publicly objected Ustaše policies—in fact, as regards for the relations with head of the Ustaše regime Ante Pavelić, &quot;it is generally agreed that they thoroughly hated each other... archbishop also opposed Fascist and Nazi ideologies, especially Nazi racist ideology, and many Ustasha policies&quot;, unlike some other members of the Croatian Catholic clergy. According to Historian Martin Gilbert, &quot;Aloysius Stepinac, who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews in an old age home.&quot;

The vast majority of the Catholic clergy in Croatia supported the Ustaše at the moment they succeeded in forming Independent State of Croatia; but later when it was clear the Allies would win, the Catholic hierarchy tried to distance the Church from the regime which involved itself in various abuses and war crimes. Yet in its pastoral letter of 24 March 1945, the Croatian Catholic Church still proclaimed its support for the puppet state and its rulers, despite the fact that most senior regime figures were preparing to flee the country. The Catholic press also maintained its support of Pavelić right to the end, and Stepinac himself performed a final Te Deum to the NDH on the anniversary of its founding, on 10 April 1945, while the NDH was carrying out the final mass killings to liquidate the Jasenovac concentration camp.

Some priests, mostly Franciscans, particularly in, but not limited to, Herzegovina and Bosnia, took part in the atrocities themselves. Priests like Ivan Guberina served as Pavelić&#x27;s bodyguards, while Dionizije Juričev, responsible for the forced conversion of Serbs in the Ustaše government, wrote that it was no longer a crime to kill seven-year-olds if they stood in the way of the Ustaše movement. In his diocesan newspaper, the Archbishop of Sarajevo, Ivan Šarić, published that the &quot;liberation of the world from the Jews is a movement for the renewal of humanity&quot;. In Bosnia the Ustaše largely ruled through the Catholic clergy, with the priest Božidar Bralo serving as a chief Ustaše delegate for Bosnia.

Miroslav Filipović was a Franciscan friar (from the Petrićevac monastery) who allegedly joined the Ustaše as chaplain and, on 7 February 1942, joined in the massacre of roughly 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages, including some 500 children. He was allegedly subsequently dismissed from his order and defrocked, although he wore his clerical garb when he was hanged for war crimes. He became Chief Guard of Jasenovac concentration camp where he was nicknamed &quot;Fra Sotona&quot; (Friar Satan) by fellow Croats. Mladen Lorković, the Croat minister of foreign affairs, formulated it like this: &quot;In Croatia, we can find few real Serbs. The majority of Pravoslavs [i.e. Orthodox Christians] are as a matter of fact Croats who were forced by foreign invaders to accept the infidel faith. Now it&#x27;s our duty to bring them back into the Roman Catholic fold.&quot;

For the duration of the war, &quot;in accordance with Vatican&#x27;s long-term diplomatic practice of not recognizing new states in wartime before they were legitimized by peace treaties, the pope did not send a nuncio or diplomat to Croatia as requested, but an apostolic visitor, the abbot Giuseppe Marcone, who was to represent the Vatican to Croatian Catholic Church, not to the government. The government ignored this nuance, bestowing a prominent place for Marcone at all official functions&quot;. After World War II ended, the Ustaše who had managed to escape from Yugoslav territory (including Pavelić) were smuggled to South America. This was largely done through ratlines operated by Catholic priests who had previously secured positions at the Vatican. Some of the more infamous members of the Illyrian College of San Girolamo in Rome involved in this were Franciscan friars Krunoslav Draganović and Dominik Mandić, and a third friar surnamed Petranović (first name unknown).

The Ustaše regime had deposited large amounts of gold—including the gold plundered from Serbs and Jews during World War II—into Swiss bank accounts. It seems a substantial quantity of gold was additionally transported by Ustaše to Austria at the end of the WWII. Out of a total, by some estimates, of 350 million Swiss francs, an intelligence report estimated 200 million (ca. $47 million) reached the Vatican. The question remains unclarified.

Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb, was accused and sentenced to prison after the end of World War II by Yugoslav communist authorities of supporting the Ustaše and of exonerating those in the clergy who collaborated with them and were hence complicit in forced conversions. Stepinac stated on 28 March 1941, noting early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs: &quot;All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The schism (between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy) is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. There is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.&quot; On 22 July 2016, the Zagreb County Court annulled his post-war conviction due to &quot;gross violations of current and former fundamental principles of substantive and procedural criminal law&quot;.

In 1998 Stepinac was beatified by Pope John Paul II. On 22 June 2003 John Paul II visited Banja Luka. During the visit he held a Mass at the aforementioned Petrićevac monastery. This caused public uproar due to the connection of the monastery with Filipović. At the same location the Pope proclaimed the beatification of a Roman Catholic layman Ivan Merz (1896–1928), who was the founder of the &quot;Association of Croatian Eagles&quot; in 1923, which some view as a precursor to the Ustaše. Roman Catholic apologists defend the Pope&#x27;s actions by stating the convent at Petrićevac was one of the places that went up in flames, causing the death of 80-year-old Friar Alojzije Atlija. Further, it was claimed by the apologists that the war had produced &quot;a total exodus of the Catholic population from this region&quot;; that the few who remained were &quot;predominantly elderly&quot;; and that the church in Bosnia then allegedly risked &quot;total extinction&quot; due to the war.

== Ustaše-Chetnik collaboration ==
Despite representing opposing nationalisms, when confronted with the growing strength of their common enemy (i.e. the partisans), Ustaše and Chetniks throughout the Independent State of Croatia signed collaboration agreements in the spring of 1942, which for the most part held until the very end of the war. The introduction to these agreements stated:As long as there is a danger of armed partisan gangs, Chetnik formations will voluntarily cooperate with the Croatian armed forces in fighting and destroying the partisans and will be under the command of the Croatian armed forces in these operations.Beyond that, the agreements specified that the NDH military will supply Chetniks with arms and ammunition, Chetniks wounded in anti-partisan operations will be treated at NDH military hospitals, and widows and orphans of killed Chetnik soldiers, will receive state financial aid equal to aid received by widows and orphans of NDH soldiers. The NDH authorities arranged for Serbs in Ustaše concentration camps to be released, but only on the special recommendation of Chetnik commanders (thus, not partisans and their sympathizers). On 30 June 1942, the Chief Headquarters of the Poglavnik (i.e. Ante Pavelić), sent a statement, signed by Marshall Slavko Kvaternik, to other NDH ministries, summarizing these agreements with NDH Chetniks.
The Ustaše signed collaboration agreements with key NDH Chetnik commanders, in the following order:
* Momčilo Đujić (commander of Chetnik Dinara Division), Brane Bogunović (commander of Gavrilo Princip Corps, Dinara Division), Mane Rokvić (commander of King Alexander I Corps, Dinara Division), Pajica Omčikus (King Petar II Corps, Dinara Division) and Pajo Popović (commander of Onisin Popović Corps, Dinara Division) in December 1941 first started negotiations with the Ustaše mayor of Knin, David Sinčić, in Knin.
* Uroš Drenović, the commander of the Chetnik »Kočić« detachment, signed an agreement with the Ustaše in Mrkonjić Grad on 27. April, 1942.
* Lazar Tešanović, commander of the Chetnik battalion, »Mrkonjić«, signed an agreement with the NDH on 23. May, 1942.
* Cvijetin Todić and Savo Božić, commanders of the Chetnik Ozren and Trebava detachments, signed agreements with the NDH on 28. May 1942. in the village Lipac
* Representatives of the Majevica Chetnik detachment, signed agreements with the NDH on 30 May 1942.
* Rade Radić, commander of the Chetnik detachment, &quot;Borja&quot;, reached agreement with the NDH authorities on 9 June 1942.
* Slavko Bjelajac and Jovan Dabović, Chetnik commanders from the Otočac area, signed agreements with the NDH on 17 December 1942.

On 26 May 1942, the Ustaše minister, Mladen Lorković, wrote in a communique to local NDH authorities, that pursuant to these agreements &quot;Home Guard Headquarters agrees with your proposal to grant one million kuna aid to the leaders of the Greek-Eastern community [i.e. Serb Orthodox], Momčilo Djujić, Mane Rokvić, [Branko] Bogunović, Paja Popović and Paja Omčikus, 200 Yugoslav guns and 10 machine guns&quot;. Ustaše and Chetniks simultaneously participated, alongside German and Italian forces, in major battles against the Partisans in the NDH: the Kozara Offensive, Case White, Operation Rösselsprung, the Battle for Knin (1944), etc.

In 1945, the Chetnik commander, Momčilo Djujić and his troops, with Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić&#x27;s permission, escaped across the NDH to the West. In April 1945, by his own admission, Ante Pavelić received &quot;two generals from the headquarters Draža Mihailović and reached an agreement with them on a joint fight against Tito&#x27;s communists&quot;, while in the first days of May, Chetnik units passed through Ustaše-held Zagreb, on their way to Bleiburg, after which Chetniks and members of the Ustaše army, were killed by the Partisans in various sites, including Tezno near Maribor.

== Structure ==
At the top of the command was the &quot;Poglavnik&quot; (meaning &quot;head&quot;) Ante Pavelić. Pavelić was appointed the office as Head of State of Croatia after Adolf Hitler had accepted Benito Mussolini&#x27;s proposal of Pavelić, on 10 April 1941. The Croatian Home Guard was the armed forces of Croatia, it subsequently merged into the Croatian Armed Forces. The Ustaše command structure was further broken down into administrations at a &quot;stožer&quot; (district), &quot;logor&quot; (country) and &quot;tabor&quot; (county) level.

==Symbols==

The symbol of the Ustaše was a capital blue letter &quot;U&quot; with an exploding grenade emblem within it.

The flag of the Independent State of Croatia was a red-white-blue horizontal tricolor with the shield of the coat of arms or Croatia in the middle and the U in the upper left. Its currency was the NDH kuna.

The Ustaše greeting was &quot;Za dom – spremni!&quot;:
: &quot;Salute:&quot; Za dom! &quot;For home(land)!&quot;
: &quot;Reply:&quot; Spremni! &quot;(We are) ready!&quot;

This was used instead of the Nazi greeting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; by the Ustaše. Today it is associated with Ustaše sympathisers. On the internet, it is sometimes abbreviated as ZDS.

==Legacy==

===In popular culture===
The Ustaše plays an important role in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s short alternate history story &quot;Ready for the Fatherland&quot;. It plays a brief background role in &quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot;, an unrelated work by the same author. In both these works, the regime founded by Pavelić lasted several decades beyond the 1940s.

Popular Croatian singer Thompson regularly starts his concerts with the Ustaše salute. The Wiesenthal Center has protested this, along with other attempts at revisionism and Holocaust-denial in Croatia.

===Modern-day Croatia===
Seeking to unify support for Croatia&#x27;s independence, Franjo Tuđman, Croatia&#x27;s first president, in the late 1980s advocated &quot;pomirba&quot;, i.e. national reconciliation between Ustaše and Partisans. This led to a revival of pro-Ustaše views, symbols and salutes among the Croatian political right. Following Croatia&#x27;s Independence in the 1990s, streets were renamed to carry the name of Ustaše leaders, such as Mile Budak and Jure Francetić. Although some of these were later removed, Radio Free Europe noted that of some 20 streets dedicated to Mile Budak in the &#x27;90s, half still remained in Croatia in 2019.

Jewish and Serb organizations, Croat historians and antifascists, as well as international observers, have repeatedly warned of revisionism in Croatia, which seeks to minimize Ustaše crimes and even celebrates the Ustaše regime. Recent examples include the publication of a book celebrating &quot;the Croatian knight&quot; Maks Luburić, who as head of Ustaše concentration camps was responsible for over 100,000 deaths, during Ustaše genocides against Jews, Serbs and Roma, and a documentary minimizing children&#x27;s deaths in Ustaše concentration camps. The Luburić book was promoted with the assistance of the Croatian Catholic Church, and Church sources minimized children&#x27;s deaths in concentration camps. Croat historians have noted that the Church has been a leader in promoting revisionism and minimizing Ustaše crimes. In 2013, the newspaper of Croatian Catholic archdioceses, &quot;Glas Koncila&quot;, published a series on Jasenovac, by the Jasenovac-denier Igor Vukić, who claims Jasenovac was a &quot;mere work-camp,&quot; where no mass executions took place. In 2015, the head of the Croatian Bishops&#x27; Conference asked that the Ustaše &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute be adopted by the Croatian army.

Croatian soccer fans have repeatedly chanted the Ustaše &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute, for which FIFA and UEFA have repeatedly leveled penalties against the Croatian soccer federation, for &quot;fascists outburst&quot;. In 2014, the Croatian soccer player Josip Šimunić was banned from the FIFA World Cup for leading a stadium full of fans in the Ustaše salute.

In 2014 the then-mayor of Split, Croatia, unveiled a monument dedicated to the 1990s HOS brigade named &quot;The Knight Rafael Boban&quot;, after the Ustaše commander, which includes the HOS emblem with the Ustaše &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute. Since then the HOS organization has organized annual commemorations at the memorial on 10 April (the anniversary of the founding of the Independent State of Croatia), during which the black-uniformed participants shout the Ustaše &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute.

In 2016 the Croatian HOS war veterans&#x27; organization posted a plaque at Jasenovac concentration camp with the Ustaše &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute. Despite protests by Jewish and other organizations, this was allowed to remain until criticism by the US State Department special envoy on Holocaust issues, forced the government to move it to a nearby town. As a result of this, and allegations of the government&#x27;s tolerance for the minimization of Ustaše crimes, Jewish, Serb and Croat WWII resistance groups refused to appear with government representatives at the annual Jasenovac commemoration.

In 2019 the Austrian government passed a law forbidding the display of Ustaše symbols, along with previously banned Nazi symbols, largely as a result of the display of same by Croatian nationalists at the annual, Croatian government-sponsored Bleiburg commemoration, where Austrian police have repeatedly arrested Croat nationalists for Nazi and fascist salutes. Three Austrian EU parliamentarians declared the Bleiburg ceremony, which tens-of-thousands of Croat nationalists attend, &quot;the largest fascist gathering in Europe.&quot; The Austrian Catholic Church banned a Mass by the Croatian Catholic Church at Bleiburg because, as they stated, &quot;the Mass at Bleiburg has become part of a manifestation that is politically instrumentalised and is part of a political-national ritual that serves to selectively experience and interpret history,&quot; adding that it misuses &quot;a religious service for political purposes while not distancing itself from the Fascist worldview.&quot;

===Modern usage of the term &quot;Ustaše&quot;===
After World War II, the Ustaše movement was split into several organizations and there is presently no political or paramilitary movement that claims its legacy as their &quot;successor.&quot; The term &quot;Ustaše&quot; is today used as a derogatory term for Croatian ultranationalism. &quot;Ustaše&quot; is sometimes used among Serbs to describe Serbophobia or more generally to defame political opponents.

==== Use by Serbian nationalists ====
Since the end of World War II, Serbian historians have used the Ustaše to promote that Serbs resisted the Axis, while Croats and Bosniaks widely supported them. However, the Ustaše lacked support among ordinary Croats and never accrued any significant support among the populace. The Ustaše regime was backed by parts of the Croatian population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serbian-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used. In the 1980s, Serbian historians produced many works about the forced conversion during World War II of Serbs in Ustaše Croatia. These debates between historians openly became nationalistic and also entered the wider media. Historians in Belgrade during the 1980s who had close government connections often went on television during the evenings to discuss real or invented details about the Ustaše genocide against Serbs during World War II. Serb clergy and nationalists blamed all Croats for crimes committed by the Ustaše, and for planning a genocide against Serb people. These propagandistic activities were aimed at justifying planned crimes and ethno-demographic engineering in Croatia.

<doc id="243928" wikidata="Q3495573" url="?curid=243928" title="Unix security">
<text>Unix security refers to the means of securing a Unix or Unix-like operating system.

==Design concepts==

===Permissions===

A core security feature in these systems is the file system permissions. All files in a typical Unix filesystem have permissions set enabling different access to a file. Unix permissions permit different users access to a file with different privilege (e.g., reading, writing, execution). Like users, different &quot;user groups&quot; have different permissions on a file.

===User groups===

Many Unix implementations add an additional layer of security by requiring that a user be a member of the &quot;wheel&quot; user privileges group in order to access the codice_1 command.

===Root access===

Most Unix and Unix-like systems have an account or group which enables a user to exact complete control over the system, often known as a root account. If access to this account is gained by an unwanted user, this results in a complete breach of the system. A root account however is necessary for administrative purposes, and for the above security reasons the root account is &quot;seldom&quot; used for day to day purposes (the sudo program is more commonly used), so usage of the root account can be more closely monitored. 

==User and administrative techniques==

===Passwords===
Selecting strong passwords and guarding them properly are important for Unix security. 

On many UNIX systems, user and password information, if stored locally, can be found in the codice_2 and codice_3 file pair.

==Software maintenance==

===Patching===
Operating systems, like all software, may contain bugs in need of fixing or may be enhanced with the addition of new features; many UNIX systems come with a package manager for this. Patching the operating system in a secure manner requires that the software come from a trustworthy source and not have been altered since it was packaged. Common methods for verifying that operating system patches have not been altered include the use of the digital signature of a cryptographic hash, such as a SHA-256 based checksum, or the use of read-only media.

==Viruses and virus scanners==
There are viruses and worms that target Unix-like operating systems. In fact, the first computer worm—the Morris worm—targeted Unix systems.

There are virus scanners for UNIX-like systems, from multiple vendors.

==Firewalls==
Network firewall protects systems and networks from network threats which exist on the opposite side of the firewall. Firewalls can block access to strictly internal services, unwanted users and in some cases filter network traffic by content.

===iptables===

iptables is the current user interface for interacting with Linux kernel netfilter functionality. It replaced ipchains. Other Unix like operating systems may provide their own native functionality and other open source firewall products exist.

<doc id="243931" wikidata="Q2298435" url="?curid=243931" title="Futures exchange">
<text>A futures exchange or futures market is a central financial exchange where people can trade standardized futures contracts defined by the exchange. Futures contracts are derivatives contracts to buy or sell specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future. Futures exchanges provide physical or electronic trading venues, details of standardized contracts, market and price data, clearing houses, exchange self-regulations, margin mechanisms, settlement procedures, delivery times, delivery procedures and other services to foster trading in futures contracts. Futures exchanges can be integrated under the same brand name or organization with other types of exchanges, such as stock markets, options markets, and bond markets. Futures exchanges can be organized as non-profit member-owned organizations or as for-profit organizations. Non-profit, member-owned futures exchanges benefit their members, who earn commissions and revenue acting as brokers or market makers; they are privately owned. For-profit futures exchanges earn most of their revenue from trading and clearing fees, and are often public corporations.

==Role in futures contracts standardization==
Futures exchanges establish standardized contracts for trading on their trading venues, and they usually specify the following: assets to be delivered in the contract, delivery arrangements, delivery months, pricing formula for daily and final settlement, contract size, and price position and limits. For assets to be delivered, futures exchanges usually specify one or more grades of a commodity acceptable for delivery and for any price adjustments applied to delivery. For example, the standard deliverable grade for CME Group&#x27;s corn futures contract is &quot;No. 2 Yellow&quot;, but holders of short positions in the contract can deliver &quot;No. 3 Yellow&quot; corn for 1.5 cents less than the contract delivery price per bushel. The locations where assets are delivered are also specified by the futures exchanges, and they may also specify alternative delivery locations and any price adjustments available when delivering to alternative locations. Delivery locations accommodate the particular delivery, storage, and marketing needs of the deliverable asset. For example, ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contracts specify delivery locations as exchange-licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware, while in the case of CME live cattle contracts, delivery is to exchange-approved livestock yards and slaughter plants in the Midwest. The futures exchange also determines the amount of deliverable assets for each contract, which determines a contract&#x27;s size. Contract sizes that are too large will dissuade trading and hedging of small positions, while contract sizes that are too small will increase transaction costs since there are costs associated with each contract. In some cases, futures exchanges have created &quot;mini&quot; contracts to attract smaller traders. For example, the CME Group&#x27;s Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index.

==Clearing and margin mechanisms==
Futures exchanges provide access to clearing houses that stand in the middle of every trade. Suppose trader A purchases of gold futures contracts from trader B. Trader A really bought a futures contract to buy of gold from the clearing house at a future time, and trader B really has a contract to sell to the clearing house at that same time. Since the clearing house took on the obligation of both sides of that trade, trader A does not have to worry about trader B becoming unable or unwilling to settle the contract – they do not have to worry about trader B&#x27;s credit risk. Trader A only has to worry about the ability of the clearing house to fulfill their contracts.

Even though clearing houses are exposed to every trade on the exchange, they have more tools to manage credit risk. Clearing houses can issue &quot;Margin Calls&quot; to demand traders to deposit Initial Margin moneys when they open a position, and deposit Variation Margin (or Mark-to-Market Margin) moneys when existing positions experience daily losses. A margin in general is collateral that the holder of a financial instrument has to deposit to cover some or all of the credit risk of their counterparty, in this case the central counterparty clearing houses. Traders on both sides of a trade has to deposit Initial Margin, and this amount is kept by the clearing house and not remitted to other traders. Clearing houses calculate day-to-day profit and loss amounts by &#x27;marking-to-market&#x27; all positions by setting their new cost to the previous day&#x27;s settlement value, and computing the difference between their current day settlement value and new cost. When traders accumulate losses on their position such that the balance of their existing posted margin and their new debits from losses is below a thresh-hold called a &quot;maintenance margin&quot; (usually a fraction of the initial margin) at the end of a day, they have to send Variation Margin to the exchange who passes that money to traders making profits on the opposite side of that position. When traders accumulate profits on their positions such that their margin balance is above the maintenance margin, they are entitled to withdraw the excess balance.

The margin system ensures that on any given day, if all parties in a trade closed their positions after variation margin payments after settlement, nobody would need to make any further payments as the losing side of the position would have already sent the whole amount, they owe to the profiting side of the position. The clearinghouse do not keep any variation margin. When traders cannot pay the variation margin they owe or are otherwise in default the clearing house closes their positions and tries to cover their remaining obligations to other traders using their posted initial margin and any reserves available to the clearing house. Several popular methods are used to compute initial margins. They include the CME-owned SPAN (a grid simulation method used by the CME and about 70 other exchanges), STANS (a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology used by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)), TIMS (earlier used by the OCC, and still being used by a few other exchanges).

Traders do not interact directly with the exchange – they interact with clearing house members, usually futures brokers, who pass contracts and margin payments on to the exchange. Clearing house members are directly responsible for initial margin and variation margin requirements at the exchange even if their clients default on their obligations, so they may require more initial margin (but not variation margin) from their clients than is required by the exchange to protect themselves. Since clearing house members usually have many clients, they can net out margin payments from their client&#x27;s offsetting positions. For example, if a clearing house member have half of their clients holding a total of 1000 long position in a contract, and half of their clients holding a total of 500 short position in a contract, the clearing house member is only responsible for the initial and variation margin of a net 500 contracts.

==Nature of contracts==

Exchange-traded contracts are standardized by the exchanges where they trade. The contract details what asset is to be bought or sold, and how, when, where and in what quantity it is to be delivered. The terms also specify the currency in which the contract will trade, minimum tick value, and the last trading day and expiry or delivery month. Standardized commodity futures contracts may also contain provisions for adjusting the contracted price based on deviations from the &quot;standard&quot; commodity, for example, a contract might specify delivery of heavier USDA Number 1 oats at par value but permit delivery of Number 2 oats for a certain seller&#x27;s penalty per bushel.

Before the market opens on the first day of trading a new futures contract, there is a specification, but no actual contracts exist. Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are &quot;created&quot; whenever open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also &quot;destroyed&quot; in the opposite manner whenever open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their short positions.

Speculators on futures price fluctuations who do not intend to make or take ultimate delivery must take care to &quot;zero their positions&quot; prior to the contract&#x27;s expiry. After expiry, each contract will be settled, either by physical delivery (typically for commodity underlyings) or by a cash settlement (typically for financial underlyings). The contracts ultimately are not between the original buyer and the original seller, but between the holders at expiry and the exchange. Because a contract may pass through many hands after it is created by its initial purchase and sale, or even be liquidated, settling parties do not know with whom they have ultimately traded.

==Regulators==
Each exchange is normally regulated by a national governmental (or semi-governmental) regulatory agency:

==History==
===Ancient times===
In Ancient Mesopotamia, around 1750 BC, the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, created one of the first legal codes: the Code of Hammurabi.

Hammurabi&#x27;s Code allowed sales of goods and assets to be delivered for an agreed price at a future date; required contracts to be in writing and witnessed; and allowed assignment of contracts. The code facilitated the first derivatives, in the form of forward and futures contracts. An active derivatives market existed, with trading carried out at temples.

One of the earliest written records of futures trading is in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;. He tells the story of Thales, a poor philosopher from Miletus who developed a &quot;financial device, which involves a principle of universal application&quot;. Thales used his skill in forecasting and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn. Confident in his prediction, he made agreements with local olive-press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their olive presses when the harvest was ready. Thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or pathetic and because the olive-press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of a poor yield. When the harvest-time came, and a sharp increase in demand for the use of the olive presses outstripped supply (availability of the presses), he sold his future use contracts of the olive presses at a rate of his choosing, and made a large amount of money. This is a very loose example of futures trading and, in fact, more closely resembles an option contract, given that Thales was not obliged to use the olive presses if the yield was poor.

===Modern era===
The first modern organized futures exchange began in 1710 at the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka, Japan.

The London Metal Market and Exchange Company (London Metal Exchange) was founded in 1877, but the market traces its origins back to 1571 and the opening of the Royal Exchange, London. Before the exchange was created, business was conducted by traders in London coffee houses using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor. At first only copper was traded. Lead and zinc were soon added but only gained official trading status in 1920. The exchange was closed during World War II and did not re-open until 1952. The range of metals traded was extended to include aluminium (1978), nickel (1979), tin (1989), aluminium alloy (1992), steel (2008), and minor metals cobalt and molybdenum (2010). The exchange ceased trading plastics in 2011. The total value of the trade is around $11.6 trillion annually.

Chicago has the largest future exchange in the world, the CME Group. The CME Group&#x27;s oldest exchange was founded in 1848. Chicago is located at the base of the Great Lakes, close to the farmlands and cattle country of the Midwest, making it a natural center for transportation, distribution, and trading of agricultural produce. Gluts and shortages of these products caused chaotic fluctuations in price, and this led to the development of a market enabling grain merchants, processors, and agriculture companies to trade in &quot;to arrive&quot; or &quot;cash forward&quot; contracts to insulate them from the risk of adverse price change and enable them to hedge. In March 2008 the CME announced its acquisition of NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. CME&#x27;s acquisition of NYMEX was completed in August 2008.

For most exchanges, forward contracts were standard at the time. However, forward contracts were often not honored by either the buyer or the seller. For instance, if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn, and at the time of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original contract price, either the buyer or the seller would back out. Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid, and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller.

In 1848 the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was formed. Trading was originally in forward contracts; the first contract (on corn) was written on March 13, 1851. In 1865 standardized futures contracts were introduced.

The Chicago Produce Exchange was established in 1874, renamed the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898 and then reorganized into the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1919. Following the end of the postwar international gold standard, in 1972 the CME formed a division called the International Monetary Market (IMM) to offer futures contracts in foreign currencies: British pound, Canadian dollar, German mark, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc.

In 1881 a regional market was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1883 introduced futures for the first time. Trading continuously since then, today the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) is the only exchange for hard red spring wheat futures and options.

Futures trading used to be very active in India in the early to late 19th Century in the Marwari business community. Several families made their fortunes in opium futures trading in Calcutta and Bombay. There are records available of standardized opium futures contracts made in the 1870-1880s in Calcutta. There are strong grounds to believe that commodity futures could have existed in India for thousands of years before then, with references to the existence of market operations similar to the modern day futures market in Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; written in the 2nd century BCE. The first organised futures market was established in 1875 by the Bombay Cotton Trade Association to trade in cotton contracts. This occurred soon after the establishment of trading in cotton Futures in UK, as Bombay was a very important hub for cotton trade in the British Empire. Futures trading in raw jute and jute goods began in Calcutta with the establishment of the Calcutta Hessian Exchange Ltd., in 1919. In modern times, most of the futures trading happens in the National Multi commodity Exchange (NMCE) which commenced futures trading in 24 commodities on 26 November 2002 on a national scale. Currently (August 2007) 62 commodities are being traded on the NMCE.

===Recent developments===
The 1970s saw the development of the financial futures contracts, which allowed trading in the future value of interest rates. These (in particular the 90‑day Eurodollar contract introduced in 1981) had an enormous impact on the development of the interest rate swap market.

The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), was launched in 1982, to take advantage of the removal of currency controls in the UK in 1979. The exchange modelled itself after the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. LIFFE was acquired by Euronext in 2002, which in turn was acquired by NYSE in 2006. The combined NYSE Euronext, including LIFFE, was purchased by ICE in 2014.

Today, the futures markets have far outgrown their agricultural origins. With the addition of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) the trading and hedging of financial products using futures dwarfs the traditional commodity markets, and plays a major role in the global financial system, trading over $1.5 trillion per day in 2005.

The recent history of these exchanges (Aug 2006) finds the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading more than 70% of its futures contracts on its &quot;Globex&quot; trading platform and this trend is rising daily. It counts for over $45.5 billion of nominal trade (over 1 million contracts) every single day in &quot;electronic trading&quot; as opposed to open outcry trading of futures, options and derivatives.

In June 2001 Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) acquired the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), now ICE Futures, which operated Europe&#x27;s leading open-outcry energy futures exchange. Since 2003 ICE has partnered with the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) to host its electronic marketplace. In April 2005 the entire ICE portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic.

In 2005, The Africa Mercantile Exchange (AfMX®) became the first African commodities market to implement an automated system for the dissemination of market data and information online in real-time through a wide network of computer terminals. As at the end of 2007, AfMX® had developed a system of secure data storage providing online services for brokerage firms. The year 2010, saw the exchange unveil a novel system of electronic trading, known as After®. After® extends the potential volume of processing of information and allows the Exchange to increase its overall volume of trading activities.

In 2006 the New York Stock Exchange teamed up with the Amsterdam-Brussels-Lisbon-Paris Exchanges &quot;Euronext&quot; electronic exchange to form the first transcontinental futures and options exchange. These two developments as well as the sharp growth of internet futures trading platforms developed by a number of trading companies clearly points to a race to total internet trading of futures and options in the coming years.

In terms of trading volume, the National Stock Exchange of India in Mumbai is the largest single-stock futures trading exchange in the world.

<text>Allegra Coleman was a fictional celebrity invented by writer Martha Sherrill for the purposes of a hoax magazine article. Ali Larter (then a model; later an actress) portrayed the imaginary actress in Sherrill&#x27;s feature, &quot;Dream Girl,&quot; which appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot; (November 1996).

== History ==
In a parody of celebrity profiles, the article described Coleman&#x27;s role in an upcoming movie with Woody Allen, her tempestuous relationship with David Schwimmer (including a scandal involving nude photographs taken by paparazzi), and her friendship with Deepak Chopra. She is said to be 22 years old, and to be the &quot;part Cherokee, part Czech&quot; daughter of &quot;pop-art photographer Max A.F. Coleman&quot; and &quot;actress Kay Garland, who played the spoiled daughter in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;&quot;, both also fictitious. The Colemans were supposedly &quot;a legendary family of circus performers and poets&quot; who were &quot;always broke and often drunk&quot;, and Allegra had &quot;lived in five countries&quot; before she was nine. Her father left his marriage and family in 1981 (he is said to have &quot;disappeared into the downtown New York drag queen scene&quot;), and her mother abandoned the family (to become a &quot;Tibetan Buddhist nun&quot;) in 1985, leaving Allegra, then 11, in a small yellow stucco house in Riverside, California to raise her siblings with assistance from relatives and friends. Coleman was married briefly at 17 to &quot;Mike Mumy&quot;, the (fictitious) brother of actor Billy Mumy; only five years later, Allegra has &quot;no idea&quot; where Mike Mumy may have gotten to.

Within the context of the article, Coleman is already a successful actress, having appeared in the TV series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and the films &quot;Down Periscope&quot;, &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; and &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, amongst others. Also within the context of the article, her life has been the subject of tabloid reportage and speculation for some time. She is consistently portrayed in the article as flighty, irresponsible, and sweetly vacuous (Salon called her &quot;brainless perfection&quot;), but with a look and personal quality of &quot;simple, irresistible vulgarity&quot; that made her magnetically compelling. By the end of the article, however, in a surrealistic turn, serious ambiguities are raised about Allegra&#x27;s actual existence; she seems to have disappeared after a car crash and it is noted that &quot;We would always have her, and the idea of her — this glorious, young, alive vision — which is all we want in the end, it turns out. Actual existence was a minor issue.&quot;

The many deliberate (and easily spotted) inaccuracies, improbabilities and contradictions were meant to be indicative that the article was a satire of a typically breathless style of celebrity profile articles, and indeed &quot;Salon&quot; magazine identified the article as a hoax immediately upon publication. The hoax was formally revealed by &quot;Esquire&quot; editor Edward Kosner in a press release to the news wire services.

The article was photographed by photographer Troy House, who knew Ali Larter from previous jobs and approached her about doing the parody. Larter, then 20, was two years younger than the fictitious Coleman. Several photos were manipulated to show &quot;Coleman&quot; interacting with Schwimmer, Chopra, Quentin Tarantino, and Pauly Shore. 

Sherrill later wrote a satirical novel on Hollywood life that was essentially both an expansion and continuation of the original &quot;Dream Girl&quot; article, and featured Allegra Coleman as a prominent character. The novel, &quot;My Last Movie Star,&quot; was published by Random House in 2003.

==Reaction==

Writing in &quot;Salon&quot;, David Futrelle commented that the article seemed to hearken back to &quot;Esquire&#x27;s&quot; mid-1960s heyday.

The article written about Coleman as the new &quot;It Girl&quot; prompted calls from studios and talent scouts eager to offer Coleman scripts. The incident jump-started Ali Larter&#x27;s acting career, and she went on to appear in TV shows (including the Niki Sanders role in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;) and movies (including &quot;Varsity Blues,&quot; &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, and &quot;Final Destination&quot;).

<text>Ortenaukreis (; ) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the west of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (clockwise from north) Rastatt, Freudenstadt, Rottweil, Schwarzwald-Baar and Emmendingen. To the west it borders the French Bas-Rhin &quot;département&quot;.

==History==
The district was created in 1973 by merging the districts of Kehl, Lahr, Offenburg, Wolfach and the southern part of the district of Bühl.

==Geography==
The western part of the district is located in the Upper Rhine Valley, the eastern part belongs to the northern Black Forest. The highest elevation of the district, the Hornisgrinde (1164 m), is located in the north-east of the district. The lowest elevation (124.3 m) is in the Rhine valley to the north. The district is named after the historical territory of the Ortenau.

==Partnerships==
The district has a friendship with the Altenburger Land district in Thuringia. Offenburg district already had a city partnership with Altenburg so, after German reunification in 1990, Ortenaukreis chose to help modernize the Altenburger Land administration to the West German standard.

France and Germany have created the Strasbourg-Ortenau eurodistrict straddling the Rhine and combining Ortenaukreis and Greater Strasbourg, with an overall population of 950,000.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is identical with that of the former Offenburg district, and is based on the coat of arms of the Ortenau canton of the League of Imperial Knights. It shows an imperial eagle with two heads, which also stands for the free imperial cities of Offenburg, Gengenbach and Zell. In an escutcheon on the breast of the eagle is the patron Saint George, depicted killing the dragon.

<text>RWTH Aachen University (), in German Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen, is a German public research university located in Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With more than 47,000 students enrolled in 144 study programs, it is the second largest technical university in Germany.

RWTH Aachen in 2019 emerged from the final of the third federal and state excellence strategy. The university will be funded as a university of excellence for the next seven years. RWTH Aachen was already part of the federal and state excellence initiative in 2007 and 2012.

Since 2007, RWTH Aachen has been continuously funded by the DFG and the German Council of Science and Humanities as one of eleven (previously nine) German Universities of Excellence for its future concept &quot;RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges&quot; and the follow-up concept &quot;The Integrated Interdisciplinary University of Science and Technology: Knowledge, Impact, Networks&quot;, also receiving grants for associated graduate schools and &quot;clusters of excellence&quot;. 

RWTH Aachen is a founding member of the CESAER association of universities of science and technology in Europe, and IDEA League, a strategic alliance of five leading universities of technology in Europe, as well as its German counterpart TU9. It is also a member of DFG and the Top Industrial Managers for Europe network.

== History ==
On 25 January 1858, prince Frederick William of Prussia (later German emperor), was given a donation of 5,000 talers from the &quot;Aachener und Münchener Feuer-Versicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot;, the precursor of the AachenMünchener insurance company, for charity. In March, the prince chose to use the donation to found the first Prussian institute of technology somewhere in the Rhine province. The seat of the institution remained undecided over years; while the prince initially favored Koblenz, the cities of Aachen, Bonn, Cologne and Düsseldorf also applied, with Aachen and Cologne being the main competitors. Aachen finally won with a financing concept backed by the insurance company and by local banks. Groundbreaking for the new &quot;Polytechnikum&quot; took place on 15 May 1865 and lectures started during the Franco-Prussian War on 10 October 1870 with 223 students and 32 teachers. The new institution had as its primary purpose the education of engineers, especially for the mining industry in the Ruhr area; there were schools of chemistry, electrical and mechanical engineering as well as an introductory &quot;general school&quot; that taught mathematics and natural sciences and some social sciences.

The unclear position of the new Prussian &quot;polytechnika&quot; (which officially were not universities) affected the first years. Polytechnics lacked prestige in society and the number of students decreased. This began to change in 1880 when the early RWTH, amongst others, was reorganized as a &quot;Royal Technical University&quot;, gained a seat in the Prussian House of Lords and finally won the right to bestow Dr.-Ing. (1899) degrees and Dipl.-Ing. titles (introduced in 1902). In the same year, over 800 male students enrolled. In 1909 the first women were admitted and the artist August von Brandis succeeded Alexander Frenz at the Faculty of Architecture as a &quot;professor of figure and landscape painting&quot;, Brandis became dean in 1929.

World War I, however, proved a serious setback for the university. Many students voluntarily joined up and died in the war, and parts of the university were shortly occupied or confiscated.

While the (then no more royal) &quot;TH Aachen&quot; (Technische Hochschule Aachen) flourished in the 1920s with the introduction of more independent faculties, of several new institutes and of the general students&#x27; committee, the first signs of nationalist radicalization also became visible within the university. Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; of the TH in 1933 met with relatively low resistance from both students and faculty. Beginning in September 1933, Jewish and (alleged) Communist professors (and from 1937 on also students) were systematically persecuted and excluded from the university. Vacant Chairs were increasingly given to NSDAP party-members or sympathizers. The freedom of research and teaching became severely limited, and institutes important for the regime&#x27;s plans were systematically established, and existing chairs promoted. Briefly closed in 1939, the TH continued courses in 1940, although with a low number of students. On 21 October 1944, when Aachen capitulated, more than 70% of all buildings of the university were destroyed or heavily damaged.

After World War II ended in 1945 the university recovered and expanded quickly. In the 1950s, many professors who had been removed because of their alleged affiliation with the Nazi party were allowed to return and a multitude of new institutes were founded. By the late 1960s, the TH had 10,000 students, making it the foremost of all German technical universities. With the foundation of philosophical and medical faculties in 1965 and 1966, respectively, the university became more &quot;universal&quot;. The newly founded faculties in particular began attracting new students, and the number of students almost doubled twice from 1970 (10,000) to 1980 (more than 25,000) and from 1980 to 1990 (more than 37,000). Now, the average number of students is around 42,000, with about one third of all students being women. By relative terms, the most popular study-programs are engineering (57%), natural science (23%), economics and humanities (13%) and medicine (7%).

=== Recent developments ===

In December 2006, RWTH Aachen and the Sultanate of Oman signed an agreement to establish a private German University of Technology in Muscat. Professors from Aachen aided in developing the curricula for the currently five study-programs and scientific staff took over some of the first courses.

In 2007, RWTH Aachen was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence for its future concept &quot;RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges&quot;, earning it the connotation of being a &quot;University of Excellence&quot;. However, although the list of universities honored for their future concepts mostly consists of large and already respected institutions, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research claimed that the initiative aimed at promoting universities with a dedicated future concept so they could continue researching on an international level. Having won funds in all three lines of funding, the process brought RWTH Aachen University an additional total funding of €180 million from 2007 to 2011. The other two lines of funding were graduate schools, where the &quot;Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science&quot; received funding and so-called &quot;clusters of excellence&quot;, where RWTH Aachen managed to win funding for the three clusters: &quot;Ultra High-Speed Mobile Information and Communication (UMIC)&quot;, &quot;Integrative Production Technology for High-wage Countries&quot; and &quot;Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass (TMFB)&quot;.

RWTH was selected to receive funding from the German federal and state governments for the third Universities of Excellence funding line starting 2019. RWTH&#x27;s proposal was called &quot;The Integrated Interdisciplinary University of Science and Technology – Knowledge. Impact. Networks.&quot; and has secured funding for a seven-year period.

2019 Clusters of Excellence

* The Fuel Science Center (FSC) Adaptive Conversion Systems for Renewable Energy and Carbon Sources
* Internet of Production
* ML4Q – Matter and Light for Quantum Computing

RWTH was already awarded funding in the first and second Universities of Excellence funding lines, in 2007 and 2012 respectively.

The RWTH itself has a University agreement with the Harbin Institute of Technology since 2019. In June 2024 a research by Correctiv journalists showed Chinese military involvement in several RWTH projects. From 100 RWTH professors in Mechanical- and Electrical engineering 19 had coorperated with researchers from NUDT and the Seven Sons of National Defence initiative and 45 had benefited from Chinese government funding. The money, in some cases channelled through companies privately held by RWTH professors, went, among other things, to projects with military applications, including radar technology for drones.

== Campus ==
RWTH Aachen University&#x27;s campus is located in the north-western part of the city Aachen. There are two core areas – midtown and Melaten district. The Main Building, SuperC student&#x27;s center and the Kármán Hall are 500 m away from the city centre with the Aachen Cathedral, the Audimax (biggest lecture hall) and the main refectory are 200 m farther. Other points of interest include the university&#x27;s botanical garden (Botanischer Garten Aachen).

A new building, the so-called &quot;Central Auditorium for Research and Learning&quot; (CARL) was opened in 2017. It offers space for 4000 students and replaces Audimax as the largest lecture hall building. The name of the new central auditorium, which is going to contain different lecture halls, is a reference to Charlemagne, who reigned his empire from Aachen in the middle-ages.

The RWTH has external facilities in Jülich and Essen and owns, together with the University of Stuttgart, a house in Kleinwalsertal in the Austrian Alps.

The university is currently expanding in the city center and Melaten district. The SuperC, the new central service building for students, was opened in 2008. The groundbreaking for the new &quot;Campus-Melaten&quot; was in 2009.

== Internationality ==
Double degrees and student mobility are promoted with other technology universities through the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network. Furthermore, the RWTH is member of the IDEA League, which is a strategic partnership among four of Europe&#x27;s leading research universities, including TU Delft, Chalmers University of Technology, and ETH Zürich, and was the first German university starting an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program in 2008.

Compared to other German universities the RWTH Aachen received the highest amount of funds granted by third-party donors in the last years.

More than 7,000 international students are currently enrolled within the undergraduate, graduate or PhD programme. Compared to other German universities the portion of international students at the RWTH Aachen is higher-than-average. The proximity of Aachen to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg combined with the subsequent exposure to a variety of cultural heritages has placed RWTH Aachen University in a unique position with regards to the reflection and promotion of international aspects and intensive interaction with other universities.

In Asia, RWTH Aachen collaborates with Tsinghua University to offer Tsinghua-Aachen (Germany) Joint Master Program.

== Organisation ==

Almost all basic lectures are held in German, but an increasing number of master programs require proficiency in English for admission.

=== Fees ===
RWTH Aachen is run by the federal state of
North Rhine-Westphalia. Since the summer semester of 2004 the state of North Rhine-Westphalia allowed universities to request a maximum of €500 per semester as tuition fees. In the past, tuition fees applied solely for long-term students and second studies. Since the summer semester of 2007, all students enrolled at the RWTH Aachen had to pay these €500, if they were not exempt for one of several reasons put forth by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Since 24 February 2011 study fees were abolished by the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia (Legislation for the Improvement of Equal Opportunities to University Admission) with effect from Winter Term 2011/12. Universities will receive 249 Mio Euro of national funding for measures that improve the quality of teaching (e.g., through additional teachers and tutors) as compensation. Tuition fees per semester are still being charged.
=== Faculties ===
The RWTH is divided into nine (previously ten) faculties:
Faculty nine was pedagogical sciences, but it was abandoned in 1989. Teacher education, however, continued.
=== Fraunhofer-Institutes ===
The university cooperates with the Fraunhofer-Institutes situated in the Melaten district of Aachen. The institutes offer workshops, courses and lectures for the students of RWTH Aachen.

* Applied Information Technology (FIT) Sankt Augustin and Aachen

<text>Multilinear algebra is the study of functions with multiple vector-valued arguments, with the functions being linear maps with respect to each argument. It involves concepts such as matrices, tensors, multivectors, systems of linear equations, higher-dimensional spaces, determinants, inner and outer products, and dual spaces. It is a mathematical tool used in engineering, machine learning, physics, and mathematics.

==Origin==
While many theoretical concepts and applications involve single vectors, mathematicians such as Hermann Grassmann considered structures involving pairs, triplets, and multivectors that generalize vectors. With multiple combinational possibilities, the space of multivectors expands to 2&quot;n&quot; dimensions, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the relevant vector space. The determinant can be formulated abstractly using the structures of multilinear algebra. 

Multilinear algebra appears in the study of the mechanical response of materials to stress and strain, involving various moduli of elasticity. The term &quot;tensor&quot; describes elements within the multilinear space due to its added structure. Despite Grassmann&#x27;s early work in 1844 with his &quot;Ausdehnungslehre&quot;, which was also republished in 1862, the subject was initially not widely understood, as even ordinary linear algebra posed many challenges at the time.

The concepts of multilinear algebra find applications in certain studies of multivariate calculus and manifolds, particularly concerning the Jacobian matrix. Infinitesimal differentials encountered in single-variable calculus are transformed into differential forms in multivariate calculus, and their manipulation is carried out using exterior algebra.

Following Grassmann, developments in multilinear algebra were made by Victor Schlegel in 1872 with the publication of the first part of his &quot;System der Raumlehre&quot; and by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. Notably, significant advancements came through the work of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, particularly in the form of &quot;absolute differential calculus&quot; within multilinear algebra. Marcel Grossmann and Michele Besso introduced this form to Albert Einstein, and in 1915, Einstein&#x27;s publication on general relativity, explaining the precession of Mercury&#x27;s perihelion, established multilinear algebra and tensors as important mathematical tools in physics.

In 1958, Nicolas Bourbaki included a chapter on multilinear algebra titled &quot;Algèbre Multilinéaire&quot; in his series Éléments de mathématique, specifically within the algebra book. The chapter covers topics such as bilinear functions, the tensor product of two modules, and the properties of tensor products.

<text>Godwits are a group of four large, long-billed, long-legged and strongly migratory waders of the bird genus Limosa. Their long bills allow them to probe deeply in the sand for aquatic worms and molluscs. In their winter range, they flock together where food is plentiful. They frequent tidal shorelines, breeding in northern climates in summer and migrating south in winter. A female bar-tailed godwit made a flight of 29,000 km (18,000 mi), flying of it without stopping. In 2020 a male bar-tailed godwit flew about non-stop in its migration from Alaska to New Zealand, previously a record for avian non-stop flight.
In October 2022, a 5 month old, male bar-tailed godwit was tracked from Alaska to Tasmania, a trip that took 11 days, and recorded a non-stop flight of .

The godwits can be distinguished from the curlews by their straight or slightly upturned bills, and from the dowitchers by their longer legs. The winter plumages are fairly drab, but three species have reddish underparts when breeding. The females are appreciably larger than the males.

Godwits were once popular as food in the British Isles. Sir Thomas Browne writing in about 1682 noted that godwits &quot;were accounted the daintiest dish in England&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Limosa&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the black-tailed godwit (&quot;Limosa limosa&quot;) as the type species. The genus name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;. The English name &quot;godwit&quot; was first recorded in about 1416–17 and is believed to imitate the bird&#x27;s call.

The genus contains four living species:




==Fossil species==
In addition, there are two or three species of fossil prehistoric godwits. &quot;Limosa vanrossemi&quot; is known from the Monterey Formation (Late Miocene, approx. 6 mya) of Lompoc, United States. &quot;Limosa lacrimosa&quot; is known from the Early Pliocene of Western Mongolia (Kurochkin, 1985). &quot;Limosa gypsorum&quot; of the Late Eocene (Montmartre Formation, some 35 mya) of France may have actually been a curlew or some bird ancestral to both curlews and godwits (and possibly other Scolopacidae), or even a rail, being placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Montirallus&quot; by some (Olson, 1985). Certainly, curlews and godwits are rather ancient and in some respects primitive lineages of scolopacids, further complicating the assignment of such possibly basal forms.

In a 2001 study comparing the ratios cerebrum to brain volumes in various dinosaur species, Hans C. E. Larsson found that more derived dinosaurs generally had proportionally more voluminous cerebrum. &quot;Limosa gypsorum&quot;, then regarded as a &quot;Numenius&quot; species, was a discrepancy in this general trend. &quot;L. gypsorum&quot; was only 63% of the way between a typical reptilian ratio and that of modern birds. However, this may be explainable if the endocast was distorted, as it had been previously depicted in the past by Deschaseaux, who is described by Larsson as calling the endocast &quot;slightly anteroposteriorly sheared and laterally compressed.&quot;

<text>gtk-gnutella is a peer-to-peer file sharing application which runs on the gnutella network. gtk-gnutella uses the GTK+ toolkit for its graphical user interface. Released under the GNU General Public License, gtk-gnutella is free software.

== History ==
Initially gtk-gnutella was written to look like the original Nullsoft Gnutella client. The original author Yann Grossel stopped working on the client in early 2001. After a while Raphael Manfredi took over as the main software architect, and the client has been in active development ever since. Versions released after July 2002 do not look like the original Nullsoft client.

== Features ==
gtk-gnutella is programmed in C with an emphasis on efficiency and portability without being minimalistic but rather head-on with most of the modern features of the gnutella network. Therefore, it requires fewer resources (such as CPU and/or RAM) than the major gnutella clients. It can also be used as headless gnutella client not requiring GTK+ at all.

gtk-gnutella has a filtering engine that can reduce the amount of spam and other irrelevant results. gtk-gnutella supports a large range of the features of modern gnutella clients. gtk-gnutella was the first gnutella client to support IPv6 and encryption using TLS. It can handle and export magnet links. It has strong internationalization features, supporting English, German, Greek, French, Hungarian, Spanish, Japanese, Norwegian, Dutch and Chinese. gtk-gnutella also has support to prevent spamming and other hostile peer activity.

Several software distributions provide pre-compiled packages, but they are usually outdated as many distributions version freeze old stable releases. The gnutella network benefits from running the latest version obtainable as peer and hostile IP address lists change rapidly, making building the latest SVN snapshot the best option. There are also pre-compiled packages for many Linux distributions available online. Persons concerned about security might wish to compile their own. The gtk-gnutella sources use dist as build and configuration system instead of Autoconf. Most users are only familiar with the configure scripts generated by the latter. Another hazard for novices is configuring NAT devices to enable full network connectivity for gtk-gnutella. gtk-gnutella, like any gnutella client, is still usable behind a firewall or a router, but with some reduced functionality, if it cannot receive incoming TCP connections or UDP packets. In an attempt to mitigate the issue for newcomers, gtk-gnutalla implements the UPnP and NAT-PMP client protocols.

gtk-gnutella supports features for downloading larger files (videos, programs, and disk images). Version 0.96.4 supports Tiger tree hash serving and versions after 0.96.5 support tiger tree hashes for uploads and downloads. Tiger tree hashing and other gtk-gnutella features make file transfers as efficient as BitTorrent. Specifically, gtk-gnutella supports partial file sharing, remote queueing and files larger than 4 GiB. Overlap checking was the only mechanism to guard against bad data prior to versions 0.96.4. Overlap checking does not guard against malicious corruption like Tiger tree hashing does.

Version 0.96.6 introduced preliminary support for a Kademlia DHT, which was completed in version 0.96.7. The DHT is replacing search by SHA-1, when locating alternate sources for a known file or looking for push-proxies. In version 0.96.7, the DHT is enabled by default. LimeWire first developed the DHT and named it Mojito DHT.

Version 0.96.9 introduced full native support for UPnP and NAT-PMP, making the usage behind a compatible router much easier since there is no longer any need to manually forward ports on the firewall. In this version the code was also ported to Microsoft Windows however the Windows port is still considered beta due to lack of wide testing so far.

Version 0.96.9 also introduced important DHT protection against Sybil attacks, using algorithms based on statistical properties.

Version 0.97 was a major release, introducing client-side support for HTTP pipelining, &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot; queries, MIME type query filtering, GUESS support (Gnutella UDP Extension for Scalable Searches) and partial file querying. Although many Gnutella vendors already supported server-side GUESS, gtk-gnutella introduced the client-side as well, also enhancing the original specifications of the protocol to make it truly usable.

Version 0.98.2 employs a minor patch to correct malloc memory allocations and multiple threads issues, mainly on Ubuntu 11.10 operating systems. This 2011 gtk-gnutella version was also dedicated to the memory of Dennis Ritchie, 1941–2011.

Version 0.98.4 added RUDP (reliable UDP) and improved partial file transfers.

Version 1.1 is a major release which added G2 support: gtk-gnutella will now connect to the G2 network in leaf mode. This allows searches from G2 nodes and lets local queries be propagated to the G2 network as well. File exchanges with G2 hosts are fully inter-operable and are permitted without restriction.

== Popularity ==
gtk-gnutella does not rank as one of the most popular clients on GnutellaNet crawls. gtk-gnutella developers&#x27; proposals have been incorporated into many gnutella clients.

In 2011, gtk-gnutella vendor extensions are the third most prolific on the GDF (Gnutella Developer Forum), following Limewire and Bearshare.

Salon listed gtk-gnutella as one of the five most popular gnutella applications in 2002. XoloX and Toadnode, also in the list, are no longer actively developed.

<text>This is a list of the universities in Finland. Institutions of higher education are designated as universities by Finnish legislation. Only universities have the right to confer degrees in the categories of &quot;alempi korkeakoulututkinto/lägre högskoleexamen&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree) and &quot;ylempi korkeakoulututkinto/högre högskoleexamen&quot; (master&#x27;s degree) and doctoral degrees.

In addition to the universities, Finland has another, separate system of tertiary education consisting of the &quot;ammattikorkeakoulus/yrkeshögskolas&quot;, which used to be translated as polytechnics but now call themselves universities of applied sciences according to international usage (see the list of polytechnics in Finland). The universities of applied sciences have the right to confer degrees in the categories of &quot;ammattikorkeakoulututkinto/yrkeshögskoleexamen&quot; and &quot;ylempi ammattikorkeakoulututkinto/högre yrkeshögskoleexamen&quot;. In international usage, these degrees have the same names as those conferred by Finnish (normal) universities, i.e. bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees.

==Universities==

=== Multidisciplinary universities ===
The Finnish universities are (sorted by the year of establishment):

=== Specialized universities ===

In Finland, there are a few institutions of higher education that have full university status, but which specialize in certain academic fields:

The National Defence University is not considered a university by Finnish law, although it has the authority to award bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees and to pursue free research, and its rector is a member of the Council of Finnish University rectors. The practical effect of this distinction is minor, and most notable in the administrative organization of the university, which is military instead of civilian.

<text>Cambridge United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Cambridge, England. They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system.

The club was founded in 1912 as Abbey United, and took the name Cambridge United in 1951. They played in local amateur leagues before joining the Southern League after finishing as runners-up of the Eastern Counties League in 1957–58. Under Bill Leivers&#x27;s stewardship they were crowned Southern League Premier Division champions in 1968–69 and 1969–70, which helped to secure their election into the Football League in 1970. They won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1972–73, but suffered immediate relegation. They won the Fourth Division title in 1976–77, and then secured promotion out of the Third Division the following season. They remained in the Second Division for six seasons, before they suffered consecutive relegations.

Manager John Beck led United to promotion out of the Fourth Division via play-offs in 1990 and then the Third Division title in 1990–91, with the club reaching the Second Division play-offs the following season. Two relegations in three years left Cambridge United back in the fourth tier, before promotion was secured at the end of the 1998–99 campaign. They entered the Conference in 2005, after two relegations in four seasons, where they remained for nine seasons. They finished as Conference runners-up three times, being beaten in the play-off finals in 2008 and 2009, before eventually securing promotion after winning the 2014 play-off final. After spending seven seasons in League Two, Cambridge United were promoted to League One as runners-up, in 2021, under Mark Bonner.

Although the club has traditionally worn amber and black at home, it has experimented with a number of designs of shirts including plain amber with black trim, amber and black squares, stripes, and amber with a black sash. The club had close links with Cambridge Regional College, a team that operated as a de facto reserve team between 2006 and 2014. The Cambridge United Community Trust perform a lot of charity work in the local community. The club is based at the Abbey Stadium on Newmarket Road, approximately east of Cambridge city centre. The stadium has a capacity of 7,937, made up of terracing and seated areas.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The club was founded in 1912 as Abbey United, named after the Abbey district of Cambridge. A club called Cambridge United existed in Cambridge from 1909, but it was not linked to the club that exists today. The club played in local amateur leagues for many of its early years, moving from ground to ground around Cambridge (see Stadium below) before settling at the Abbey Stadium. In 1949 the club turned professional, and changed its name to Cambridge United in 1951. They played in the Eastern Counties League until finishing as runners-up in 1957–58, which saw them promoted to the Southern League. Three years later, Cambridge United reached the Premier Division of the Southern League.

===First League era: 1970–2005===

After election to the Football League in 1970, to replace Bradford (Park Avenue), the club was promoted from the Fourth Division after three seasons, but went straight back down.

Following the appointment of Ron Atkinson as manager, Cambridge United won successive promotions which took them into the Second Division in 1978 – a mere eight years after joining the Football League. Atkinson had gone to West Bromwich Albion, a First Division club, in January 1978, and was succeeded by John Docherty, who oversaw the second promotion.

Cambridge United peaked at eighth place in the Second Division in 1980. However, a terrible season in 1983–84 (setting a league record for most successive games without a win, 31, which was surpassed by Derby County in 2008) was followed by a further relegation in 1984–85 (equalling the then league record for most losses in a season, 33). These successive relegations, which also had a negative effect on the club&#x27;s attendances as well as its finances, placed Cambridge United back in the Fourth Division, the lowest professional league in English football at the time. They had to apply for re-election in their first season back in the Fourth Division, and promotion would not be achieved for another four years.

The early 1990s was the U&#x27;s most successful period. Soon after the appointment of new manager John Beck, the club won the first ever appearance as a professional club at Wembley Stadium, the Fourth Division playoff final in May 1990, which secured promotion to the Third Division – the club&#x27;s first promotion for 12 years. Dion Dublin scored the only goal in a game against Chesterfield. Under Beck, United gained promotion from the Fourth Division and had already reached the FA Cup quarter finals in 1990, and reached them again a year later, and winning the Third Division in 1991. United reached the play-offs in 1992, after finishing 5th in the Second Division, but failed in their bid to become founder members of the Premier League. This was the club&#x27;s highest final league placing to date. The following season the club sacked John Beck and were relegated from the new First Division. Further relegation followed two seasons later. United returned to Division Two but were relegated in 2002 despite a successful run in the Football League Trophy which saw them reach the final which they lost 1–4 to Blackpool at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

In 2005, after 35 years in the Football League, Cambridge United were relegated into the Football Conference. This brought with it financial difficulties and the club filed for administration on 29 April. On 22 July 2005 the club came out of administration with a deal being struck with HM Revenue and Customs at the eleventh hour after the intervention of then sports minister Richard Caborn. Cambridge had sold their Abbey Stadium home earlier in the season for £1.9 million to keep the club afloat.

===In the Conference: 2005–2014===
On the eve of the 2006–07 season, it was announced that former Norwich City striker Lee Power would be the club&#x27;s new chairman taking over from Brian Attmore&#x27;s caretaking reign. Johnny Hon was also to rejoin the board as vice-chairman after John Howard&#x27;s resignation on conflict of interests grounds (owing to his ownership of Bideawhile 445 Ltd, United&#x27;s landlords). Jimmy Quinn was appointed manager soon after Power took charge and, after a difficult settling-in period which included a humiliating 5–0 loss to local rivals Histon, he guided Cambridge United away from another possible relegation by achieving five wins from their last seven games of the season.

After signing several respected and experienced players at the non-league level in the following close season Quinn led Cambridge to their then longest ever unbeaten start to a season (2007–08), which stretched to twelve games. Off the field, United reported several major sponsorship deals which seemed to point towards increased financial security. Halfway through the season the chairman, Lee Power, resigned. He was replaced by Wayne Purser. United finished the season in 2nd place, qualifying for the play-offs. They beat Burton Albion in the semi-final, 4–3 on aggregate, but lost 1–0 to Exeter City in the final, played at Wembley Stadium.

Following the play-off defeat many players left the club, culminating in the departure of manager Jimmy Quinn. Quinn was succeeded by former Southport manager Gary Brabin, who appointed Paul Carden as player-assistant manager. United finished the 2008–09 season again 2nd in the league, and also again reached the play-off final, overturning a 3–1 deficit to beat Stevenage Borough 4–3 on aggregate in the semi-final; however, they were beaten again at Wembley Stadium, 2–0 by Torquay United. Brabin was named as the Conference&#x27;s Manager of the Season, but was sacked in the close-season after reportedly falling out with the chairman. He was replaced by Martin Ling, who resigned just eight days into the job, before the start of the 2009–10 season and was followed days later by chairman George Rolls. The new board re-appointed Ling as manager the following week.

Cambridge finished Ling&#x27;s first season in 10th place – not enough for a playoff place. The following season, on 6 January 2011, with Cambridge in a similar position to where they finished the previous season, the club&#x27;s owners put the club up for sale citing the need for new funds to take the club forward. Despite interest being expressed from a number of parties, no new owner has yet been found. Later the same month, the club&#x27;s landlords Grosvenor Group revealed the plans for a new community stadium, including potential new locations both within the city and outside it. At the start of 2011 Martin Ling was removed from his position as manager and replaced on a temporary basis by CRC manager Jez George. He managed to steer the club towards safety, finishing 17th, which led to George&#x27;s role being made permanent. After having rebuilt the squad with players from the club&#x27;s youth system and with astute signings in Harrison Dunk and Tom Shaw, George managed to lead Cambridge to a 9th-place finish, a huge improvement on their previous season. As well as the league, Jez George also took Cambridge to the quarter-final of the FA Trophy (which was the furthest they had reached at the time), but lost 2–1 at home to minnows, Wealdstone. Eleven games into the following season Jez George became Director of Football, and Richard Money was announced as the new head coach of the club. The club spent much of the season in mid-table, finishing in 14th position with 59 points. The squad was greatly revamped, and United started 2013–14 with a record-breaking 16 games unbeaten. Cambridge finished the season in second place, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating FC Halifax Town 2–1, on aggregate, in the semi-final, they won 2–1 against Gateshead in the final, held at Wembley Stadium, gaining promotion back to the Football League after a nine-year absence. The club also reached their first FA Trophy final, held at Wembley Stadium, where they beat Gosport Borough 4–0.

===2014–present: Back in The Football League ===

In their first season back in the Football League, Cambridge United progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they drew at home with Premier League team Manchester United. The match at the Abbey Stadium ended in a goalless draw, forcing a replay at Old Trafford, which Manchester United won 3–0. In the league, Cambridge finished 19th with 51 points, 10 points above the relegation zone. The following season started poorly, and Richard Money was sacked in November 2015, to be replaced by Shaun Derry who would lead Cambridge to a 9th-place finish.

In the 2019–20 season, Mark Bonner was placed in temporary charge until the end of the season. Under Bonner, Cambridge won four from their final seven matches before the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the season with Cambridge placed in 16th after a points per game ruling. After being given the role permanently, Bonner guided Cambridge to promotion as runners-up in the 2020–21 season.

Following additional investment from the club&#x27;s co-owners, Cambridge bought back the Abbey Stadium from Grosvenor in September 2022, 20 years after selling it.

==Colours and badge==
Cambridge United have traditionally worn amber and black home kits in a variety of designs, including plain amber with black trim (e.g. 1979–1991), amber and black quarters (1996–1998) and halves (e.g. 1924–25), and a variety of stripes (e.g. 1926–1936. Only between 1957–1960 and 1970–1972 have shirts not been predominantly amber, when the club opted for white with a small amber and black detail on the shirt&#x27;s sleeves. Away from home, kits have often been white with some amber and/or black detail, although recently shirts have been blue at the request of the away shirts sponsors, Kershaw.

A sponsor first appeared on a Cambridge United shirt for the 1985–86 season when the shirt was changed mid-season from plain amber to amber and black stripes. Spraymate were the club&#x27;s first shirt sponsor, and have since been followed by an array of local and national companies: Lynfox, Howlett, Fujitsu, Beaumont Stainless Steels, Premier Travel, C and R Windows, Quicksilver (couriers), Capital Sports, The Global Group, Haart, Global Self Drive, and in 2009–10 Greene King IPA.

The teams kits have been manufactured by a number of companies, with Admiral providing the first strip on which a maker&#x27;s logo appeared. The club have subsequently worn kits created by, among others, Nike, Patrick, Sporta and, Vandanel, with the latter providing the strip for the 2007–08 season and subsequently an amber shirt featuring a dramatic black sash design that polarised the opinions of fans. In the summer of 2010 the Club parted company with Vandanel, citing concerns regards the company&#x27;s ability to continue to service their needs, signing a deal with Italian company Erreà. For the start of the 2013–14 season, The U&#x27;s signed a deal with Genesis Sports to provide Puma team wear for the club. This deal has been continued into the 2014–15 season and saw the home shirts make a return to amber and black stripes. At the beginning of the 2019-2020 Campaign they have switched to Sportswear Company Hummel, however since the start of the 2023–24 season the kit has been produced by umbro.

The club&#x27;s current crest, a large football over which the letters &#x27;CU&#x27; are emblazoned, with three turrets on top, has been worn on its shirts since the 1986–87 season, with a brief change to a more &#x27;elaborate&#x27; design between 1996 and 1998. Previously, shirts had simply been embroidered with the club&#x27;s acronym &#x27;CUFC&#x27; or a &#x27;Book &amp; Ball&#x27; badge used during the late 1970s. The club used a special badge to commemorate their centenary in the 2012–13 season.

==Stadium==

Cambridge United currently play their home matches at the Abbey Stadium, which has been their home since 1932. The stadium is located in the Abbey area of the city on Newmarket Road, approximately 3 kilometres (1.8miles) east of the city centre. The stadium currently has a capacity of 8,127, of which 4,376 are seated. Due to sponsorship reasons, the ground has also been known as The R. Costings Abbey Stadium and the Cambs Glass Stadium.

Before opening the Abbey with a victory over Cambridge University Press in a friendly on 31 August 1932, United had played matches at a number of venues around the city. When playing under the Abbey United name, games were played on Midsummer Common until the outbreak of World War I. When the war ended, the club moved to Stourbridge Common and, after promotion to the Cambridgeshire League Division One in 1923, moved once again to land just off Newmarket Road in Cambridge. This ground, affectionately known as the &#x27;Celery Trenches&#x27; due to the poor state of the pitch, was christened with a 1–0 league victory over Histon Institute and became United&#x27;s home for a decade. While based at the Trenches, the club established its offices at the &#x27;Dog &amp; Pheasant&#x27; pub on Newmarket Road, which it used as an away dressing room on matchdays, as well as a store for equipment including the pitch&#x27;s goalposts. However, the Cambridgeshire FA were unhappy with the state of the pitch at this new home, and the club moved to Parker&#x27;s Piece at the start of the 1930–31 season. Despite the special significance of Parker&#x27;s Piece in the history of football, it being the first place where the Cambridge Rules were played out, the lack of spectator capacity and disruption caused during games meant this move was not a successful one.
In January 2006, John Howard announced plans to move out of the Abbey Stadium to a new purpose-built stadium in Milton. This was supported by Cambridgeshire Horizons. These were criticised by fans as risking the club&#x27;s identity by moving out of the city and, despite Howard describing them as crucial to the club&#x27;s future, little else was heard of them publicly. Subsequently, a new community stadium, that would also include conference facilities, was ruled out by a Planning Inspector&#x27;s report which described it as unsuitable development in the green belt and in October 2009, Cambridge United announced its intentions to redevelop the Abbey Stadium with chairman.

The Stadium was sold by Bideawhile to Grosvenor Estates in June 2010. Soon after, the new landlords, in combination with the club and supporters group Cambridge Fans United, announced that they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to positively work together to achieve the relocation of the club to a new stadium. In January 2011, plans for a new community stadium were unveiled at an open meeting, including potential new locations both within the city and outside it.

A final site, at Trumpington Meadows, was agreed upon and initial plans for an 8,000 capacity stadium were put forward, as part of a &quot;Cambridge Sporting Village&quot; incorporating housing and retail development. Objections from residents and local councils saw the proposal blocked in 2013, and plans announced in January 2015 keep the sporting village development at Trumpington, but without the new stadium. Instead Cambridge United will redevelop the Abbey Stadium. First plans were presented in May 2015, which would increase capacity of the Newmarket Road End, incorporating safe standing, complete redevelopment of the Habbin Terrace and slight expansion to the Main Stand.

Cambridge United bought back the Abbey Stadium in September 2022, and restarted planning for significant expansion and improvement of the ground, with larger new stands proposed for the terraced Newmarket Road End and Habbin Stand.

==Supporters==

Cambridge United have a number of supporters&#x27; groups and associations, some of which are independently run and some are run by the club itself. These include: an Away Travel Club, who provide travel to every away game as well as hosting fundraising events and sponsoring senior players; youth group Junior U&#x27;s; Cambridge United Supporters Association, a group giving a voice to the fans in communications with the club and the media; Vice-presidents Club, who offer match day hospitality packages; and regional associations in St Ives, East Cambridgeshire, Royston, St Neots, Bedfordshire and Saffron Walden.
Cambridge Fans United is an independent supporters group who are now a significant shareholder in the club with representation on the fans&#x27; behalf on the board of directors. In addition to these supporters&#x27; groups, the club currently has one independent fanzine, United in Endeavour, which raises funds for Cambridge Fans United and is sold at home games.

During their time in the Conference, attendances at the Abbey were amongst the highest in the league. Cambridge United&#x27;s first two seasons in the Conference saw them post the fourth-highest average attendance figures in both years (2,607 in 2005–06 and 2,815 in 2006–07). They had the third-highest attendances in their final season in the Conference, averaging 3,085 for 2013–14.

SiFive became the main sponsor of the Cambridge United F.C. for the 2022/23 and the 2023/24 seasons. The partnership is intended to amplify both of their visions to support each other and the community, as well as establish SiFive within the city.

==Rivalries==
Prior to election into the Football League, Cambridge City were regarded as the club&#x27;s biggest rivals, although the rivalry has since waned significantly. Peterborough United are considered to be their current main rivals, something that was recognised in a survey by the Football Fans Census as a reciprocated feeling, where the two sides contest the Cambridgeshire derby. This is despite the fact the two clubs have experienced many seasons in separate divisions. Other lesser rivalries include those with Northampton Town, Colchester United, Luton Town, and Stevenage.

===Reserves and Centre of Excellence===
Before relegation from the Football League in 2005, Cambridge United entered a reserve team in the Football Combination. However, this ceased following financial difficulties which meant the club could not guarantee being able to put out a team for every game. In 2006 United formed Cambridge Regional College as a de facto reserve team and entered them in the Eastern Counties League Premier Division. FA rules prohibit reserve teams playing at certain levels of the football pyramid, and so the CRC name was adopted in recognition of the college&#x27;s financial support, and because the team is made up almost entirely of the college&#x27;s students.

Cambridge United&#x27;s Centre of Excellence is widely regarded throughout professional football circles as one of the best in England. Many players have come through the youth team to establish themselves as first team players at Cambridge (for example Dan Gleeson, Daniel Chillingworth, Robbie Willmott and Josh Coulson) and go on to play at a higher level (recent examples include John Ruddy, Michael Morrison and Josh Simpson). Wales international Jack Collison was in the youth squads for several years before joining West Ham United&#x27;s youth academy after the centre closed down following relegation to the Conference Premier.

The youth team won their division of the Football League Youth Alliance in both 2003–04 and 2004–05, showing the strength of the club&#x27;s Centre of Excellence. The club&#x27;s success in the FA Youth Cup in recent years has also far surpassed its expectation given the level of the parent club – in 2006–07 the team was the highest placed non-league team reaching the Fourth Round after seven games (including qualifying games).

===Notable former players===
* &quot;For all former players with a Wikipedia article see :Category:Cambridge United F.C. players&quot;

Notable players include Wilf Mannion, the only former Cambridge United player to be inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, Brian Moore, former West Ham United player who scored a club record 68 goals in 1957–58 despite blindness in one eye, and Lindsay Smith, voted Cambridge United&#x27;s all-time cult hero in a poll for BBC Sport&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot; in August 2004.
Others include Dion Dublin, who went on to score 119 Premier League goals and receive four England caps, and Luke Berry, cult hero who finished as United’s top scorer in various seasons and played for Luton Town in the Premier League in the 2023-24 season.

<text>In linguistics, the partitive is a word, phrase, or case that indicates partialness. Nominal partitives are syntactic constructions, such as &quot;some of the children&quot;, and may be classified semantically as either set partitives or entity partitives based on the quantifier and the type of embedded noun used. Partitives should not be confused with &quot;quantitives&quot; (also known as pseudopartitives), which often look similar in form, but behave differently syntactically and have a distinct meaning.

In many Romance and Germanic languages, nominal partitives usually take the form: 
[DP Det. + &quot;of&quot; + [DP Det. + NP]]
where the first determiner is a quantifier word, using a prepositional element to link it to the larger set or whole from which that quantity is partitioned. The partitive constructions of the following languages all have the same translation, with a very similar form:

Some languages, for example Estonian, Finnish, and Basque have a special partitive case. In Latin, German and Russian, the partitive is expressed by the genitive case, sometimes called the &quot;partitive genitive&quot;.

==Set partitives and entity partitives==

Partitives can be distinguished semantically based on whether they involve a part of a whole, called &quot;entity partitives&quot;, or a subset of a larger set, called &quot;set partitives&quot;. The embedded NPs in entity partitives denote either entities at the individual level, such as &quot;a cookie&quot; or entities at the group level, such as &quot;Bob and Sue&quot;. Some phrases such as ‘the linguists’ can be interpreted as either a group level entity and thus participate in an entity partitive – &quot;half of the linguists&quot;; alternatively, it can be interpreted as a set of entities, and thus participate in a set partitive – &quot;one of the linguists&quot;.

 Set partitives contain plural countable nouns in their embedded noun phrase (NP), and can be combined with quantifier determiners such as &quot;many&quot;, and specific numbers such as &quot;three&quot;. Entity partitives can contain either singular countable nouns or mass nouns (and sometimes even plural countable nouns), combining with determiners such as ‘much’, or those with a fractional meaning, like ‘half’. Other determiners can be combined with either type of partitive, including ‘some’, ‘many’, and ‘all’. The following is a list of different quantifier determiners in English and their classification as either participating in entity partitives, set partitives, or both:

==The partitive constraint==

Given the following syntactic structure of partitives, &quot;[DP Det. + of + [DP Det. + NP]]&quot;, the first determiner is a quantifier word which quantifies over a subset or part of the embedded DP, which either denotes a set or a whole respectively. The second determiner is usually an article, a demonstrative, a possessive determiner, or even another quantifier.

Jackendoff proposed a version of the partitive constraint in which the embedded determiner phrase (DP) must be definite, and thus must be headed by a definite determiner, such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;these&quot;, or &quot;my&quot;.

However, this approach fails to account for phrases such as &quot;half of a cookie,&quot; that are partitives and yet lack a definite determiner. De Hoop instead points to the existence of set partitives and entity partitives in formulating the partitive constraint, rather than the definiteness of the NP. She states that:

: Only NPs that can denote entities are allowed in entity partitives and only NPs that can denote sets of entities are allowed in set partitives.

 1. a) *one of a cookie
 b) half of a cookie

 2. a) *one of the water
 b) half of the water

(2a) is ungrammatical even though it has a definite article because the denoted entity does not match. &quot;The water&quot; denotes an entity, and &quot;one&quot; is a set entity partitive determiner. (1b) is correct because indefinite and definite singular count nouns denote single entities rather than a set of entities, therefore it is grammatical when proceeded by &quot;half&quot;, an entity partitive determiner.

It should also be noted that some linguists consider the partitive constraint to be problematic, since there may be cases where the determiner is not always obligatory. Linguists do, however, agree that universal quantifiers, such as: every, and each, cannot be embedded in the partitive position. Furthermore, the second determiner can be &quot;all&quot; only if the first determiner is a superlative, or fractional expression.

 3. a) &quot;The best of all the wines&quot;
 b) &quot;15% of all the relationships&quot;

It has also been hypothesized that perhaps &quot;of&quot; in sentences, such as the above, do not act as the partitive themselves, but rather the superlative in the sentence provides the role of partition.

==Anti-uniqueness==

Barker claims that partitives are &quot;anti-unique&quot;; that is, a partitive cannot refer to a unique individual or set of individuals, but must have at least two individuals or sets of individuals in its extension, causing a degree of indefiniteness.

In addition, he limits a partitive to being only able to refer to a proper subset, which he calls &quot;proper partitivity&quot;. This means that, for example, in the partitive phrase &quot;one of John’s friends&quot;, that John must have at least two friends for this to be a proper partitive, and in order for it to satisfy anti-uniqueness by not referring to a unique individual. Similarly, &quot;three of John’s friends&quot; would imply that John has at least four friends, from which an indeterminate three are being referred to.

 4. a) I met [one of John&#x27;s friends].
 b) *I met the [one of John&#x27;s friends].
 c) I met the [one of John’s friends] that you pointed out this morning.

Furthermore, Barker states that DP partitive constructions cannot be headed by a definite determiner without being modified by a relative clause, that there is some inherent indefiniteness in partitives according to their property of anti-uniqueness. This explains why 4b) is ill-formed, since it is unclear which of John’s friends is being singled out, yet can be made to take a definite determiner by adding context, such as in 4c), which now refers to a single specific friend of John matching the modifier clause.

==Partitives and quantitatives==

A true partitive should be distinguished from a very similar construction called a quantitative (often called a &quot;pseudopartitive&quot;, or sometimes a non-partitive).

 5. a) A box of those chocolates
 b) A box of chocolates

 6. a) *The three of those cars
 b) The three cars

A true partitive, as shown in 5a), has the interpretation of a quantity being a part or subset of an entity or set. Quantitives, simply denote either a quantity of something or the number of members in a set, and contain a few important differences in relation to true partitives.

First off, while partitives cannot be preceded by a definite determiner, such as in 6a), quantitatives can be; 6b) is a well-formed quantitive.

While the NP in partitives is usually preceded by a definite determiner, the NP in quantitive constructions containing &quot;of&quot; cannot be preceded by any determiner; this distinguishes the true partitive in 5a) from the quantitative in 5b), which denotes a quantity of chocolates, but does not denote a smaller quantity of chocolates taken from a larger quantity of chocolates, as 5a) does.

Quantitives can be interpreted as partitives, though, when modified. Consider the example, &quot;three children in the class&quot;; this means &quot;three children out of the children that are in the class&quot;, which has a partitive meaning.

One point which is important in distinguishing between partitives and pseudopartitives in English is a separation between two semantically different &quot;of&quot;s. The first is a genitive &quot;of&quot;, which indicates a kind-of or type-of relation demonstrated in the phrase &quot;a book of history&quot;, in which &quot;of&quot; is used to modify the kind of book denoted, alternatively phrased as the compound noun &quot;a history book&quot;. Similarly, &quot;a piece of chocolate&quot; can be analyzed as a certain kind of piece, namely a chocolate piece. The second is a partitive &quot;of&quot;, which indicates a part-of relation and means &quot;out of the total number of&quot; in the case of set partitives. A partitive like &quot;a piece of this chocolate&quot; does not refer to any chocolate piece, but a piece taken from the whole of a certain chocolate.
Although the syntactic distribution of partitives and pseudo-partitives seems to be complementary, cross-linguistic data suggests this is not always true. Non-partitives can display an identical syntactic structure as true partitives and the ultimate difference is a semantic one. Vos pointed out that Dutch contains nominals fulfilling the syntactic criterion but lacking a partitive interpretation; they are therefore classified as non-partitives.

The first Dutch phrase above is classified as a non-partitive. This is counter-intuitive at first glance because the phrase has a &quot;Det+of+Det+N&quot; sequence which is a consistent structure observed in partitives. A closer look at the Dutch data reveals that in denoting relativation and extraction relationships, non-partitives (or &quot;weak indirect partitive construction&quot; in Vos’s terminology) function as an adjectival modifier as opposed to ordinary partitives (&quot;strong indirect partitive construction&quot;) carrying a determiner-like element. Therefore, diew contains an adjectival meaning closer to &#x27;such&#x27; and indicates funny examples of a certain &quot;type&quot;. In the second example, dies is truly a definite determiner and is referring to a particular larger set of funny examples.

==Structural approaches to partitives==
While a number of linguists have proposed different approaches to account for the partitive structure, three approaches will be introduced here.

===A functional projection approach===
In 1995, Guillermo Lorenzo proposed a partitive (π), which is equivalent to the meaning of &quot;out of&quot; in English, is a functional category by itself and projects to a phrasal level. A partitive phrase (πP) is selected by the Numeral (Num) and in turn the partitive head (π) selects the following DP. A Spanish example is shown below:


 8. [NumP &quot;muchos&quot; [πP &quot;de&quot;[DP &quot;estos&quot; [NumP [Num° [&quot;libr-i+-os&quot;] [NP &quot;ti&quot;]]]]]&quot; 
 many of these book +s

===Partitive prepositional phrase approach===
Advocates of the &quot;partitive prepositional phrase (partitive PP)&quot; approach claim that the partitive meaning is integrated into a PP. Structurally, a quantifier is followed by a noun, and a preposition in between denotes the quantifier is a subset of the following noun.

Within a partitive PP construct, the preposition &quot;of&quot; contains lexical content similar to ‘out of’ and always projects to a PP, hence the name partitive PP. Supporters of partitive PP often assume the presence of an empty noun following the quantifier in order to specify the two sets in relation and the preposition introduces the bigger set. Catalan provides evidence for this underlying structure:

In the first example, the notion denotes the set of &quot;three men&quot; is a subset of &quot;those men&quot;. The second example has an overt noun inserted between the quantifier and the partitive PP and is still considered grammatical, albeit odd and redundant to a native speaker of Catalan. The third sentence has an empty noun holding the final noun position. Altogether this is taken as strong evidence that an empty noun category should be posited to license a partitive meaning.
Alternatively, some linguists argued an empty noun placement is unnecessary if one considers the quantifier’s role to be quantifying a subset. The noun following the partitive PP automatically becomes the bigger set and the whole nominal represents a subset-set relation.

===Quantifier-based approach===
Closely related to the partitive PP approach, some authors propose an alternate analysis which also focuses on looking at partitive distribution in nominals. Vos claims that it is the relationship between the quantifier and the noun collectively determine the partitive meaning.

Under this view, the preposition belongs to a functional category and its existence is solely for grammatical reasons. In other words, the preposition is not registered with any lexical content. Vos claims the internal relation between the first and second noun in a nominal partitive implicitly denotes a subset-set, possessive or part-whole relation. Similarly, de Hoop embraces the idea that only when a quantifier pairs with a desired type of DP, specific kind of partitive relation can then be determined. The preposition &quot;of&quot; plays a crucial role in enabling the selected DP to surface.

The deciding factor to label a partitive construction concerns with the presence of an internal DP, as demonstrated in the English examples below:

The nouns in the partitives all refer to a particular bigger set since they are preceded by an internal definite determiner (possessive: &quot;my&quot;, demonstrative: &quot;this&quot; and &quot;those&quot;, and definite article: &quot;the&quot;). On the other hand, their pseudo-counterparts lack this implication. Without a definite determiner, pseudo-partitives can only denote an amount of things, and the characteristics of a set are determined by the context of the discourse. In addition, the set denoted in a pseudopartitive does not necessarily have to be bigger.

Intuitively, the last two phrases under the pseudo-partitive column do indicate some kind of partition. However, when they are broken down into syntactic constituents, noted in true partitives, the noun always projects to a DP. In contrast, the noun in the phrase-final position projects to a NP (noun phrase) in non-partitives.

==Partitive constructions==
The partitive nominal construction consists of structure &quot;[DP Det. + of + [DP Det. + NP]]&quot;, as shown in 10a).

 10. a) Three of John’s friends.
 b) Three friends of John’s.

A related construction traditionally called the double genitive has been argued by Barker to actually be a partitive, which he terms the possessive partitive (shown in 10b), rather than simply a redundant application of the genitive marker ‘s.

Barker claims that this is a use of the partitive &quot;of&quot;, rather than the gentitive ‘of’, distinguishing it from being a gentitive construction. To support this, he notes that prenominal possessives such as &quot;Mary’s child&quot; cannot occur with a following possessor introduced by the genitive &quot;of&quot; such as, &quot;Mary’s child ofGEN John&quot;. This phrase is illogical, since nominals are syntactically constrained to only allow one possessor. Yet, prenominal possessives can be combined with possessive partitives, containing the partitive &quot;of&quot;, such as &quot;my favorite story ofPART yours&quot;. This phrase is grammatical, taking the meaning &quot;my favourite story out of your stories&quot;.

 11. a) a picture of John
 b) a picture of John&#x27;s

Similarly, 11a) does not mean the same as 11b). The first is an instance of the genitive &quot;of&quot;, and means that John is in the picture. The second is an instance of the partitive &quot;of&quot;, and hence is a possessive partitive; in contrast, it means a picture from the collection of pictures that belong to John, but does not say anything about whether John is in the picture.

 12. a) a friend of John&#x27;s
 b) a friend of John&#x27;s friend

Nor do 12a) and 12b) mean the same. The first is a possessive partitive, referring to someone who is a member of the set of John’s friends. The second includes a postnominal genitive &quot;of&quot; phrase, and refers instead to someone who is a friend in relation to a member of the set of John’s friends, but not necessarily to John himself.

 13. a) three friendsi of [John’s friendsi]
 b) three [ei] of [John’s friendsi]
 c) three friendsi of [John’s [ei]]

The difference between the nominal partitive and the partitive possessive constructions may in fact be a matter of ellipsis in the phonetic forms, as suggested by Zamparelli.

He proposes that the two constructions have the same logical form, for example 13a), where the word friend has the same referent in both positions. Variations then arise in the phonetic form depending on which &quot;friend&quot; word is ellipsed. In the nominal partitive, the first &quot;friend&quot; is ellipsed, becoming 13b), whereas the possessive partitive ellipses the second instance of &quot;friend&quot;, yielding 13c).

==Partitive case: Finnish morphology==

Finnish indicates the partitive by inflecting nouns in the partitive case. An object takes the partitive case under the following three conditions:

The aspectual condition is if the object is governed by an unbounded (or atelic) verb, that is, one which does not indicate the result of an action. The NP-related (quantity) condition is if the object is quantitatively indeterminate, which means indefinite bare plurals or mass nouns. Lastly, the negative condition applies when a predicate is negated, in which case nearly all objects are marked with the partitive.

These three conditions are generally considered to be hierarchically ranked according to their strength such that negation &gt; aspect &gt; quantity. Negation is strongest in that it applies so pervasively to negated events, regardless of aspect or quantity.

An example of the NP-related condition is shown below, borrowed from Huumo:

In (a), the object is a mass noun, where the partitive case indicates an open, unspecified quantity of butter using the suffix &quot;-ta&quot;, as opposed to a closed quantity or total object, which Finnish would specify by using the accusative suffix –n, as in (b).

These two examples above show the contrast that exists in Finnish between the partitive object and total object, the former indicating incompleteness of an event or an open quantity. Whereas the partitive object takes the partitive case, the total object can be marked with nominative, genitive, or accusative and indicates aspectual completeness or closed quantity.



In the case of (c), the partitive object is triggered by the unbounded aspect of the verb, not the quantity of the object, since the openness of the quantity is irrelevant. Unboundedness in verbs denotes whether there is a direct consequence following the action of the verb. The verb&#x27;s aspect is progressive, involving an ongoing action without a specified endpoint, and is therefore unbounded. This aspectual unboundedness requires the partitive object, and has the effect of concealing the quantity of the object. This shows that aspect is stronger than quantity in conditioning the partitive.

In (d) and (e), &quot;to shoot&quot; in Finnish is an intrinsically neither bound nor unbound verb since the shooting can cause the three different results of the target being killed or only wounded or not being hit. (In English, &quot;to shoot&quot; with a direct object has the first two senses and requires additions such as &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;and killed&quot; to not be ambivalent, and the third sense is only possible by adding the preposition &quot;at&quot;.) &quot;To kill&quot; would be an intrinsically bound verb, where the consequence is someone/something being dead. In the data, the morpheme &quot;–a&quot; is the partitive morpheme. In (d), the verb &quot;shot&quot; takes a partitive object and specifies the activities of &quot;shooting without killing&quot; or &quot;shooting at but not necessarily hitting&quot;. In (e), the verb takes an accusative object and denotes accomplishment of hitting and killing. Hence, the difference of unboundness or boundness in the verb, whether the bear was hit (and killed) by the bullet or not, is reflected by the difference in the morphology of the object.

The common factor between aspectual and NP-related functions of the partitive case is the process of marking a verb phrase&#x27;s (VP) unboundness. A VP has the semantic property of having either an unbounded head or unbounded argument. For example, in Finnish the partitive case suffix denotes an unbound event, while the accusative case suffix denotes a bounded event. Note that when translating Finnish into English, the determiners could surface as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;some&quot; or numerals in both unbound and bound events.

<text>The usher of the Black Rod is an official in the parliaments of several countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. The title is often shortened to Black Rod, and in some countries, formally known as Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod or Lady Usher of the Black Rod. The position originates in the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Equivalent positions exist in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. 

The position is similar to serjeant-at-arms in other bodies.

==Origin==
The office was created in 1350 by royal letters patent, though the current title dates from 1522. The position was adopted by other members of the Commonwealth when they adopted the British Westminster system. The title is derived from the staff of office, an ebony staff topped with a golden lion, which is the main symbol of the office&#x27;s authority.

A ceremonial rod or staff is a common symbol indicating the authority of the office holder. Depictions of ancient authority figures in many cultures include such a rod (alternatively called a sceptre). Another early example is the fasces (a bound bundle of rods) carried by guards (&quot;lictors&quot;) who accompanied high-level officials in the Roman Republic and later Empire.

==United Kingdom==
===Appointment===
Black Rod is formally appointed by the Crown based on a recruitment search performed by the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is the employer of all House of Lords officials. Prior to 2018 the office was held by retired senior military officers. Black Rod is an officer of the English Order of the Garter, and is usually appointed Knight Bachelor if not already knighted. Their deputy is the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod. Since early 2018, the post has been held by Sarah Clarke. She is the first non-veteran in almost 200 years to hold the post.

===Official duties===
Black Rod is principally responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order within the House of Lords and its precincts, as well as for ceremonial events within those precincts. Previous responsibilities for security, and the buildings and services of the Palace of Westminster, have been passed, respectively, to the Parliamentary Security Director (as of the post&#x27;s creation in January 2016) and Lords Director of Facilities (as of that post&#x27;s creation and the retirement of the then-Black Rod in May 2009).

Black Rod&#x27;s official duties also include responsibility as the usher and doorkeeper at meetings of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; the personal attendant of the Sovereign in the Lords; as secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain and as the Serjeant-at-Arms and Keeper of the Doors of the House, in charge of the admission of strangers to the House of Lords. Either Black Rod or their deputy, the Yeoman Usher, is required to be present when the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, is in session, and plays a role in the introduction of all new Lords Temporal in the House (but not of bishops as new Lords Spiritual). Black Rod also arrests any Lord guilty of breach of privilege or other Parliamentary offence, such as contempt or disorder, or the disturbance of the House&#x27;s proceedings. Their equivalent in the House of Commons is the Serjeant at Arms.

Former Black Rod David Leakey said that 30% of his work as Black Rod was within or for the House of Commons.

Black Rod, along with their deputy, is responsible for organising ceremonial events within the Palace of Westminster, providing leadership in guiding the significant logistics of running such events.

===Ceremonial duties===

====Mace====
Black Rod is in theory responsible for carrying the Mace into and out of the chamber for the Speaker of the House of Lords (formerly the Lord Chancellor, now the Lord Speaker), though this role is delegated to the Yeoman Usher and Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms, or on judicial occasions, to the Lord Speaker&#x27;s deputy, the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. The mace was introduced in 1876.

====State Opening of Parliament====
Black Rod is best known for their part in the ceremonies surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the Speech from the throne. Black Rod summons the Commons to attend the speech and lead them to the Lords. As part of the ritual, the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons are slammed in the approaching Black Rod&#x27;s face. This is to symbolise the Commons&#x27; independence of the Sovereign. Black Rod then strikes the door three times with their staff, and is then admitted and issues the summons of the monarch to attend.

This ritual also happens whenever the Lords have a commission to be read and Black Rod summons MPs to hear it. For example, on Tuesday 17 December 2019 this ritual happened twice.

This ritual is derived from the attempt by Charles I to arrest Five Members in 1642, in what was seen as a breach of the constitution. This and prior actions of the King led to the Civil War. After that incident, the House of Commons has maintained its right to question the right of the monarch&#x27;s representatives to enter their chamber, although they cannot bar them from entering with lawful authority.

===List of Serjeants-at-Arms of the House of Lords===
Technically the serjeant at arms attending the Lord Chancellor (the former presiding officer of the House of Lords) was regarded as an officer of the House of Lords. He was appointed for life until 1713 and during good behaviour thereafter, originally receiving a daily remuneration and from 1806 an annual salary. The post was merged with that of Black Rod in 1971.

The following is a list of Serjeants-at-Arms of the House of Lords since 1660:

* 1660: Humphrey Leigh
* 1668: Edward Wood (in Extraordinary; did not succeed to the reversion)
* 1671: Sir George Charnock (in Extraordinary)
* 1673: Sir George Charnock (in Ordinary) jointly with Roger Charnock
* 1697: Peter Persehouse
* 1713: Sarles Goatley
* 1713: Charles Stone
* 1716: Francis Jephson
* 1745: Richard Jephson
* 1789: William Watson
* 1818: George Francis Seymour
* 1841: Alexander Perceval
* 1858: Colonel Sir Wellington Patrick Manvers Chetwynd Talbot
* 1899: Major-General Sir Arthur Edward Augustus Ellis
* 1901: Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Fleetwood Isham Edwards
* 1910: Major-General Sir Stanley de Astel Clarke
* 5 November 1910: Captain Sir Seymour John Fortescue
* 1 February 1936: Major-General Sir Charles Edward Corkran
* 17 March 1939: Admiral Sir Herbert Meade-Fetherstonhaugh
* 2 December 1946: Air Vice-Marshal Sir Paul Copeland Maltby
* 17 March 1962: Captain Kenneth Lachlan Mackintosh
* 1 January 1971: Admiral Sir Frank Twiss
&quot;Since 1971 the office of Serjeant at Arms has been held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.&quot;
==Black Rods outside the UK==
As in the United Kingdom, Black Rods in other parliaments are responsible for arresting any senator or intruder who disrupts the proceedings.

===Australia===
The Australian Senate and the upper houses in five Australian states and territories have their own Usher of the Black Rod. (Queensland abolished its upper house, and the assemblies of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have always been unicameral.)

The current Usher of the Black Rod for the Australian Senate is John Begley. In the Australian Senate, the Usher of the Black Rod assists with the administration and security of the Senate and has the power to take anyone into custody who causes a disturbance in or near the Senate chamber.

===Canada===
The Usher of the Black Rod for the Senate of Canada is the equivalent to the Black Rod office for the House of Lords. The position was also known as the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod until 1997, when the appointment of the first female Black Rod prompted the word &quot;gentleman&quot; to be dropped from the title.

The provincial legislatures of Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island have also incorporated the position of the Black Rods into their respective parliamentary systems.

===Cook Islands===
In the Cook Islands the Usher of the Black Rod is the messenger of the King&#x27;s Representative at the ceremonial opening of parliament.

In 2023, the Cook Islands adopted a black rod () carved from wood salvaged from the gallery of the Ziona Tapu Church in Avarua. The black rod was designed by Tangata Vainerere, the clerk of the Cook Islands parliament, and carved by Wireless Tomokino. The piece of wood it was carved from is thought to be over 160 years old. It was first used at the ceremonial opening of the 18th parliament on 22 March 2023.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, where the Legislative Council was abolished in 1951, the Usher of the Black Rod continues to summon MPs to the chamber for the Throne Speech. It is not a full-time position.

Arthur Bothamley was the first person to hold the role; he was usher of the black rod for 45 years from 1892 until August 1937. In September 1937, he was succeeded by Captain Douglas Bryan, who retired in June 1957. John Everitt Seal took over from Bryan in June 1957 and held the role until his death on 1 November 1964. Alexander John Mackay Manson was appointed in May 1965 to succeed Seal in time for the opening of the second term of the 34th New Zealand Parliament later that month. Manson retired in June 1971. In May 1972, Melville Harvey Scott Innes-Jones was appointed to succeed Manson. Innes-Jones retired in 1991.

William Nathan, appointed in 1993, was the first Māori Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. Colonel Nathan retired in 2005, and was followed by David Baguley. David Williams was appointed as the acting Usher of the Black Rod in 2017 for the opening of the 52nd New Zealand Parliament. Sandra McKie was appointed to act in the role in 2020 for the opening of the 53rd Parliament, the first woman to hold the position. McKie was permanently appointed to the role effective from 17 October 2022, following the formal retirement of Baguley.

The ceremonial black rod was presented to Parliament by Governor-General Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe in January, 1931. Made of polished black ebony, it is topped by a golden lion rampant holding a shield bearing the royal cypher of King George V and has a 1931 gold sovereign set in its base. Due to the fragility of the original 1931 black rod, alternative black rods are now used during the official openings of Parliament.
===South Africa===
The Senate of South Africa had a Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod from its inception in 1910 to abolition in 1980. When the Senate was restored in 1994 the renamed position of Usher of the Black Rod returned with it, continuing in the new National Council of Provinces.

===Former ===
====Ireland====
Before the Act of Union 1800, which united the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, there was also a Black Rod in the Irish House of Lords. From 1783 the Irish Black Rod was also Usher of the Order of St Patrick, so the office continued after the Union. No one was appointed to the office after the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922.

*1707: Andrew Fountaine
*c.1708–1709: Thomas Ellys
*1711–17??: Brinsley Butler, 1st Viscount Lanesborough (died 1735)
*1745–17??: Robert Langrishe
*1745–1747: Solomon Dayrolles
*1747–17??: William FitzWilliam

*1915–1917: Sir John Olphert
*1918–1933: Sir Samuel Murray Power

The Senate of Northern Ireland had a Black Rod throughout its existence, until the disbandment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972.

==Related ushers==
Before the Acts of Union 1707 united the English and Scottish parliaments, there was a Heritable Usher of the White Rod who had a similar role in the Estates of Parliament in Scotland. This office is currently held by John Armes, Bishop of Edinburgh, but the role carries no duties.

Gentleman ushers exist for all the British orders of chivalry, and are coloured as follows:
* The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod – Most Noble Order of the Garter
* The Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod – Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle
* The Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod – Most Honourable Order of the Bath
* The Gentleman Usher of the Blue Rod – Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George
* The Gentleman Usher of the Purple Rod – Most Excellent Order of the British Empire

<text>Documenta (often stylized documenta) is an exhibition of contemporary art which takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany.

Documenta was founded by artist, teacher and curator Arnold Bode in 1955 as part of the Bundesgartenschau (Federal Horticultural Show) which took place in Kassel at that time. It was an attempt to bring Germany up to speed with modern art, both banishing and repressing the cultural darkness of Nazism. This first Documenta featured many artists who are generally considered to have had a significant influence on modern art (such as Picasso and Kandinsky). The more recent editions of the event feature artists based across the world, but much of the art is site-specific.

Every Documenta is limited to 100 days of exhibition, which is why it is often referred to as the &quot;museum of 100 days&quot;. Documenta is not a selling exhibition.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Documenta&quot;, an invented word, reflects the intention of the exhibition (in particular of the first Documenta in 1955) to be a documentation of modern art which was not available for the German public during the Nazi era. Rumour spread from those close to Arnold Bode that it was relevant for the coinage of the term that the Latin word &quot;&quot; could be separated into &quot;&quot; &#x27;teach&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;intellect&#x27;, and therefore thought it to be a good word to describe the intention and the demand of Documenta.

Each edition of Documenta has commissioned its own visual identity, most of which have conformed to the typographic style of solely using lowercase letters, which originated at the Bauhaus.

==History==

Art professor and designer Arnold Bode from Kassel was the initiator of the first Documenta. Originally planned as a secondary event to accompany the Bundesgartenschau, this attracted more than 130,000 visitors in 1955. The exhibition centred less on &quot;contemporary art&quot;—that is, art made after 1945—instead, Bode wanted to show the public works which had been known as &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; in Germany during the Nazi era: Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, Blauer Reiter, Futurism and Pittura Metafisica. Therefore, abstract art, in particular the abstract paintings of the 1920s and 1930s, was the focus of interest in this exhibition.

Over time, the focus shifted to contemporary art. At first, the show was limited to works from Europe, but soon covered works by artists from the Americas, Africa and Asia. &quot;4. documenta&quot;, the first ever to turn a profit, featured a selection of pop art, minimal art and kinetic art. Adopting the theme of &quot;Questioning Reality – Pictorial Worlds Today,&quot; the 1972 Documenta radically redefined what could be considered art by featuring minimal and conceptual art, marking a turning point in the public acceptance of those styles. Also, it devoted a large section to the work of Adolf Wolfli, the great Swiss outsider, then unknown. Joseph Beuys performed repeatedly under the auspices of his utopian Organization for Direct Democracy. Additionally, the 1987 Documenta show signaled another important shift with the elevation of design to the realm of art – showing an openness to postmodern design. Certain key political dates for wide-reaching social and cultural upheavals, such as 1945, 1968 or 1976/1977, became chronological markers of &quot;documenta X&quot; (1997), along which art&#x27;s political, social, cultural and aesthetic exploratory functions were traced. &quot;Documenta11&quot; was organized around themes like migration, urbanization and the post-colonial experience, with documentary photography, film and video as well as works from far-flung locales holding the spotlight. In 2012, &quot;documenta (13)&quot; was described as &quot;ardently feminist, global and multimedia in approach and including works by dead artists and selected bits of ancient art&quot;.

==Criticism==
Documenta typically gives its artists at least two years to conceive and produce their projects, so the works are often elaborate and intellectually complex. However, the participants are often not publicised before the very opening of the exhibition. At &quot;documenta (13)&quot;, the official list of artists was not released until the day the show opened. Even though curators have often claimed to have gone outside the art market in their selection, participants have always included established artists. In the &quot;documenta (13)&quot;, for example, art critic Jerry Saltz identified more than a third of the artists represented by Marian Goodman Gallery in the show.

Documenta&#x27;s decision to feature some of its shows outside of Germany, in peripheral contexts has sparked numerous critical discussions that reaches an apogee around documenta14 which partly took place in Athens, Greece in 2017. Various critics raised concerns about the ways in which the institution&#x27;s endorsement of Athens as a place of resistance and novelty entailed a patronizing Orientalist stance, linked to new forms of tourism and the enjoyment of underdeveloped sites of &quot;crisis&quot;.

In 2022, Documenta caused three separate anti-Semitism controversies: one revolving around the banner &quot;Peopleʼs Justice&quot; (2002) by the Indonesian collective Taring Padi that contained anti-Semitic imagery; another on the inclusion of the Palestinian collective Question of Funding in the exhibition; and, lastly, the inclusion of a 1988 Palestinian liberation movement brochure by Burhan Karkoutly titled &quot;Presence des Femmes&quot;. Artist Hito Steyerl pulled her work from the exhibition in protest to the first two instances, with managing director Sabine Schormann&#x27;s departure as a consequence. In response to the controversy spurred by &quot;Presence des Femmes&quot;, Documenta released a statement urging the artistic team to remove the drawings until they can be &quot;appropriately contextualized&quot;; scholars from the Archives of Women’s Struggles in Algeria stated: &quot;[&quot;Presence des Femmes&quot;] was in solidarity by the Algerian women with the Palestinian people, in denouncing the crimes committed by the Israeli State. We would like this document, like many other texts or artworks in the world, to be placed in its historical and political context.&quot;

In November 2023, Documenta receives the resignation letter of the remaining curators María Inés Rodríguez, Simon Njami, Gong Yan and Kathrin Rhomberg, after the resignation of Bracha L. Ettinger and Ranjit Hoskote. The letter precises &quot;In the current circumstances we do not believe that there is a space in Germany for an open exchange of ideas and the development of complex and nuanced artistic approaches that documenta artists and curators deserve.&quot;

Following the controversy, Documenta announced in November 2024 that Naomi Beckwith, Deputy Director and Chief Curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, had been selected as the curator for the sixteenth edition.  

==Directors==
The first four &quot;documentas&quot;, organized by Arnold Bode, established the exhibition&#x27;s international credentials. Since the fifth Documenta (1972), a new artistic director has been named for each Documenta exhibition by a committee of experts. &quot;Documenta 8&quot; was put together in two years instead of the usual five. The original directors, Edy de Wilde and Harald Szeemann, were unable to get along and stepped down. They were replaced by Manfred Schneckenburger, Edward F. Fry, Wulf Herzogenrath, Armin Zweite and Vittorio Fagone. Coosje van Bruggen helped select artists for &quot;documenta 7&quot;, the 1982 edition. &quot;documenta IX&quot;&#x27;s team of curators consisted of Jan Hoet, Piero Luigi Tazzi, Denys Zacharopoulos and Bart de Baere. For &quot;documenta X&quot; Catherine David was chosen as the first woman and the first non-German speaker to hold the post. It is also the first and unique time that its website Documenta x was conceived by a curator (swiss curator Simon Lamunière) as a part of the exhibition. The first non-European director was Okwui Enwezor for &quot;Documenta11&quot;.

The salary for the artistic director of Documenta is around €100,000 a year.

2012&#x27;s edition was organized around a central node, the trans-Atlantic melding of two distinct individuals who first encountered each other in the &quot;money-soaked deserts of the United Arab Emirates&quot;. As an organizing principle it is simultaneously a commentary on the romantic potentials of globalization and also a critique of how digital platforms can complicate or interrogate the nature of such relationships. Curatorial agents refer to the concept as possessing a &quot;fricative potential for productive awkwardness,&quot; wherein a twosome is formed for the purposes of future exploration.

==Venues==
Documenta is held in different venues in Kassel. Since 1955, the fixed venue has been the Fridericianum. The documenta-Halle was built in 1992 for &quot;documenta IX&quot; and now houses some of the exhibitions. Other venues used for Documenta have included the Karlsaue park, Schloss Wilhelmshöhe, the Neue Galerie, the Ottoneum and the Kulturzentrum Schlachthof. Though Okwui Enezor notably tried to subvert the euro-centric approach Documenta had taken, he instigated a series of five platforms before the &quot;Documenta11&quot; in Vienna, Berlin, New Delhi, St Lucia and Lagos, in an attempt to take Documenta into a new post-colonial, borderless space, from which experimental cultures could emerge. &quot;documenta 12&quot; occupied five locations, including the Fridericianum, the Wilhelmshöhe castle park and the specially constructed &quot;Aue-Pavillon&quot;, or meadow pavilion, designed by French firm Lacaton et Vassal. At &quot;documenta (13)&quot; in 2012 about a fifth of the works were unveiled in places like Kabul, Afghanistan and Banff, Canada.

There are also a number of works that are usually presented outside, most notably in Friedrichsplatz, in front of the Fridericianum and the Karlsaue park. To handle the number of artworks at &quot;documenta IX&quot;, five connected temporary &quot;trailers&quot; in glass and corrugated metal were built in the Karlsaue. For &quot;documenta (13)&quot;, French architects Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal constructed the temporary &quot;Aue-Pavillon&quot; in the park.

==Permanent installations==
A few of the works exhibited at various &quot;documentas&quot; remained as purchases in Kassel museums. They include &quot;7000 Eichen&quot; by Joseph Beuys; &quot;Rahmenbau&quot; (1977) by Haus-Rucker-Co; &quot;Laserscape Kassel&quot; (1977) by Horst H. Baumann; &quot;Traumschiff Tante Olga&quot; (1977) by Anatol Herzfeld; &quot;Vertikaler Erdkilometer&quot; by Walter De Maria; &quot;Spitzhacke&quot; (1982) by Claes Oldenburg; &quot;Man walking to the sky&quot; (1992) by Jonathan Borofsky; and &quot;Fremde&quot; (1992) by Thomas Schütte (one part of the sculptures are installed on Rotes Palais at Friedrichsplatz, the other on the roof of the Concert Hall in Lübeck).

==Documenta archive==
The extensive volume of material that is regularly generated on the occasion of this exhibition prompted Arnold Bode to create an archive in 1961. The heart of the archive’s collection comes from the files and materials of the Documenta organization. A continually expanding video and image archive is also part of the collection as are the independently organized bequests of Arnold Bode and artist Harry Kramer.

==Management==
===Visitors===
In 1992, on the occasion of &quot;documenta IX&quot;, for the first time in the history of Documenta, more than half a million people traveled to Kassel. The 2002 edition of Documenta attracted 650,000 visitors, more than triple Kassel&#x27;s population. In 2007, &quot;documenta 12&quot; drew 754,000 paying visitors, with more than one-third of the visitors coming from abroad and guests from neighboring Netherlands, France, Belgium and Austria among the most numerous. In 2012, &quot;documenta (13)&quot; had 904,992 visitors.

===Budget===
In 2007, half of Documenta&#x27;s budget of 19 million euros ($25.7 million) came from the city of Kassel, the state of Hessen and Germany&#x27;s Kulturstiftung des Bundes. The rest came from sponsors, donors and ticket sales.

Documenta 14’s budget was at 37 million euros ($40 million), spread between 2013 and 2018; by the end of 2017, its deficit was expected to reach 5.4 million euros. Overspending in Athens led to a liquidity shortfall of 7 million euros, forcing the shareholders of Documenta — the city of Kassel and the German state of Hesse — to step in with emergency loan guarantees worth 8 million euros.

<doc id="243988" wikidata="Q1185856" url="?curid=243988" title="Democratic Left (Ireland)">
<text>Democratic Left () was a left-wing political party in Ireland between 1992 and 1999. It came into being after a split in the Workers&#x27; Party, and after seven years in existence it was incorporated into the Labour Party in 1999. Democratic Left served in a three-party coalition government with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, termed the Rainbow Coalition, from December 1994 to June 1997.

==Origins==

Democratic Left was formed after a split in the Workers&#x27; Party, which in turn had its origins in the 1970 split in Sinn Féin. Although never formally styled as a communist party, the Workers&#x27; Party had an internal organisation based on democratic centralism, strong links with the Soviet Union, and campaigned for socialist policies. The party gained support during the 1980s - a decade of cutbacks and hardship in Ireland - winning 7 TDs in the 1989 general election and 24 councillors in the 1991 local elections.

However between 1989 and 1992 the Workers&#x27; Party was beset by a number of problems. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe had put many Soviet-aligned parties on the defensive and had caused a number of them to reconsider their core ideological beliefs. A faction led by Proinsias De Rossa wanted to move the party towards an acceptance of free-market economics, viewing the party&#x27;s Marxist stance as an obstacle to further electoral success. The party was languishing in opinion polls and there was increasing tension between the party&#x27;s elected representatives such as De Rossa, Pat Rabbitte and Eamon Gilmore and another grouping involving activists and organisers on the party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee, led by Sean Garland. Finally the broadcast of a BBC Spotlight programme in June 1991 had raised questions on the party&#x27;s links to the Official IRA. The Official IRA had been on ceasefire since 1972 but was frequently accused of being involved in fund-raising robberies, money-laundering and other forms of criminality.

On 15 February 1992, a special conference was held in Dún Laoghaire to reconstitute the party. Over the preceding two weeks there were clashes at a number of party meetings between supporters of De Rossa and Garland. A motion proposed by De Rossa and general secretary Des Geraghty sought to stand down the existing membership, elect an 11-member provisional executive council and make several other significant changes in party structures. Initially supporters believed that the motion would pass but it was defeated by 9 votes. After the announcement of the results, De Rossa told the delegates &quot;You have your decision. I honestly believe it is a bad decision, but you have made it,&quot;. Both sides accused each other &quot;packing votes&quot;.

==Formation==
After the conference it was clear a split was inevitable. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting held on 22 February in Wynns Hotel in Dublin City, six of the party&#x27;s TDs resigned from the party along with more than half of the Ard Chomhairle. The members who left included the party leader Proinsias De Rossa and five more of the party&#x27;s seven members of Dáil Éireann (Pat Rabbitte, Eamon Gilmore, Eric Byrne, Pat McCartan and Joe Sherlock). The party&#x27;s president for most of the previous 30 years, Tomás Mac Giolla refused to join the breakaway and remained with the Workers&#x27; Party although he had reluctantly supported the constitutional amendments and had considered departing the party after the conference. The new party was provisionally named New Agenda with De Rossa becoming leader of the new party.

There was speculation that the Labour TD Emmet Stagg would join the new grouping. Stagg, who was on the left of the Labour Party, had resigned the party whip before the Workers&#x27; Party split and it was indicated that he might join the new group. However Stagg eventually opted not to join. The party was hampered by the fact that it immediately lost Dáil privileges such as speaking rights, the ability to table priority questions and the allocation of private members time it had enjoyed as the Workers&#x27; Party as it did not meet the minimum requirement of 7 TDs. The new party did not qualify for the party leader&#x27;s allowance scheme depriving it of a vital source of funding.

The party was renamed Democratic Left at its founding conference held on 28 March 1992. The new party was defined as a:
{{cquote|democratic socialist party. We believe that the idea of socialism coupled with the practice of democracy provides the basis for the radical transformation of Irish society. We aim to be a feminist party. An environmental party. A party of the unemployed and low-paid. A champion of personal freedom. A friend and ally of the third world. An integral part of the European Left.{{sfn|Rafter|2011|p=106}}

==Electoral history and participation in government==
The party&#x27;s first contest was the 1992 UK general election, in which it stood in two constituencies in Northern Ireland and polled 2,133 votes. The election was fought under the label of New Agenda.

In the North the party contested elections in 1996 for the Northern Ireland Forum but with less than 1% of the vote they failed to have any members elected. The party inherited two councillors at its foundation: Seamus Lynch lost his Belfast City Council seat in 1993, Gerry Cullen had been elected for the Workers&#x27; Party in 1989 in Dungannon Town and was re-elected in 1993 and 1997 local elections.

In the 1992 Irish general election the party lost two of its six Dáil seats (Eric Byrne narrowly following a week of counting and recounting, Pat McCartan and Joe Sherlock losing their seats, and Liz McManus winning a seat in Wicklow), gaining 2.8% of the vote compared to 5% for the pre-split Workers&#x27; Party in the preceding general election.

Joe Sherlock was elected on the Labour Panel to Seanad Éireann as part of an election pact with their politically polar opposites Progressive Democrats.

The party subsequently won two seats in by-elections, Eric Byrne regaining his seat in Dublin South Central and Kathleen Lynch in Cork North Central.

After the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition government in 1994, Democratic Left joined the new coalition government with Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Proinsias De Rossa served as Minister for Social Welfare, initiating Ireland&#x27;s first national anti-poverty strategy.

In the 1997 general election Democratic Left lost two of its six seats, both of its by-election victors being unseated. The party won 2.5% of the vote. The party also was in significant financial debt because of a lack of access to public funds, due to its size. Between 1998 and 1999 the party entered discussions with the Labour Party which culminated in the parties&#x27; merger in 1999, keeping the name of the larger partner but excluding members in Northern Ireland from organising. This left Gerry Cullen, their councillor in Dungannon Borough Council, in a state of limbo, representing a party for whom he could no longer seek election. The launch of the merged party was in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin on 24 January 1999. Labour Party leader Ruairi Quinn remained leader of the unified party, while De Rossa took up the largely titular position of party president. Only 10% of Democratic Left delegates at the special conference had voted against the merger. In 1999 De Rossa successfully contested the European Parliament election in Dublin. He held his Dáil seat until he stood down at the 2002 general election. He held his European Parliament seat in the 2004 election and 2009 election

In 2002, the former Democratic Left TDs Pat Rabbitte and Liz McManus were elected as Labour Party leader and deputy leader respectively. When Rabbite stepped down as Labour leader after the 2007 general election, Gilmore was elected unopposed as his successor.

<text>Ottó Titusz Bláthy (11 August 1860 – 26 September 1939) was a Hungarian electrical engineer. During his career he became the co-inventor of the modern electric transformer, the voltage regulator, the AC watt-hour meter, the turbo generator, the high-efficiency turbo generator and the motor capacitor for the single-phase (AC) electric motor. 

Bláthy&#x27;s career as an inventor began during his time at the Ganz Works in 1883. There, he conducted experiments for creating a transformer. The name &quot;transformer&quot; was created by Bláthy. In 1885 the &quot;ZBD&quot; model alternating-current transformer was invented by three Hungarian engineers: Ottó Bláthy, Miksa Déri and Károly Zipernowsky. (&quot;ZBD&quot; comes from the initials of their names). In the autumn of 1889 he patented the AC watt-meter.

== Early life ==
He attended schools in Tata and Vienna, where he obtained diploma of machinery in 1882.
Between 1881 and 1883 he worked at the machinery workshop of the Hungarian Railways (MAV). Attracted by the successes of Károly Zipernowsky, he joined his team on 1 July 1883. He admitted he had learnt nothing about electrotechnics in university, so he started to learn about the theory himself. Using the Maxwell equations he invented a practical approach of sizing magnetic coils.
Kapp and Hopkinson (for whom Hopkinson&#x27;s law is named) published their findings only later in 1886 and 1887, respectively.

== Professional life ==
His practical calculation method was crucial in building the first practical transformer. Based on his findings, he rebuilt his machines in 1883 and obtained better efficiency with the same weight. He was the first to investigate the heat dissipation problems of electric motors, and at that time the connection between current density and heat was determined.

At the Turin Italian National Exhibition in 1884, he saw Gaulard and Gibbs&#x27;s &quot;secondary generator&quot;&#x27; (i.e. AC transformer) system, and he decided to improve it. Including a closed-loop magnetic field, based on the findings of Faraday, he conducted experiments with Miksa Déri in the summer of 1884 at the Ganz factory. Based on these experiments, they invented the transformer in 1885, which was unveiled at the Budapest National Exhibition in 1885. In the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core. The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed &quot;core form&quot; or &quot;shell form&quot; . The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world&#x27;s first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.

In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments; In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.

The first specimen of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced on the basis of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy&#x27;s patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory at the end of the same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters. The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy&#x27;s original invention.

In 1886 Blathy undertook a journey to America, where he also visited the Edison Works. It was there that he observed that the parameters of the exciting coils of the machines to be produced were established on the basis of empirically set charts. Blathy proved that these data can be derived from rigorous calculations as well, thus winning the admiration of the engineers at the factory. He did not stay in America for a long time.

Based on the opinions of Galileo Ferraris, the Italian government ordered a power transformer for Rome, which was installed in October 1886. Later, they designed a power plant for Tivoli, built by Ganz, with six water turbines and 5000 V, which were worked in parallel with the old steam engine generators. This was the first time in history two high-voltage power plants were connected.

== Chess works ==
Besides his scientific work, Bláthy is well known as an author of chess problems. He specialized in the field of very long moremovers, also known as longmovers. (see grotesque (chess) for one of his problems).

<text>Miksa Déri (27 October 1854 in Bács, Austrian Empire – 3 March 1938) was a Hungarian electrical engineer, inventor, power plant builder. He contributed with his partners Károly Zipernowsky and Ottó Bláthy, in the development of the closed iron core transformer and the ZBD model. His other important invention was the constant voltage AC electrical generator in the Ganz Works in 1883. The missing link of a full Voltage sensitive - voltage intensive (VSVI) system was the reliable AC Constant Voltage generator. Therefore, the invention of the constant voltage generator at the Ganz Works had crucial role in the beginnings of the industrial scale AC power generating, because only these type of generators can produce a stated output voltage, regardless of the value of the actual load.

ZBD was an abbreviation of the three men&#x27;s names: Zipernowsky, Bláthy and Déri.

Déri is also noted for inventing the single phase type of repulsion motor

<text>Károly Zipernowsky (born as Carl Zipernowsky, 4 April 1853 in Vienna – 29 November 1942 in Budapest) was an Austrian-born Hungarian electrical engineer. He invented the transformer with his colleagues (Miksa Déri and Ottó Bláthy) at the famous Hungarian manufacturing company Ganz Works and he contributed significantly with his works also to other AC technologies.

==Biography==

Zipernowsky, with Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri, all of Ganz and Company, were researching ways of increasing efficiency of electrical power transmission. They experimented with power supplies and current transformation, which led to the invention of the ZBD alternating current transformer in 1885. The ZBD system is based on a closed-iron ring core with an arbitrary diameter and a coil around the core, which conducts AC current. Their system converted higher voltage suitable for energy transmission to lower &quot;&quot;service&quot;-level voltage (step-down transformer). Nikola Tesla then proposed the use of step-up transformers, which would output higher voltage than they received. This principle is widely used for power transmission over long distances all over the world.

<text>Esquire is an American men&#x27;s magazine. Currently published in the United States by Hearst, it also has more than 20 international editions.

Founded in 1933, it flourished during the Great Depression and World War II under the guidance of founders Arnold Gingrich, David A. Smart, and Henry L. Jackson while during the 1960s it pioneered the New Journalism movement. After a period of quick and drastic decline during the 1990s, the magazine revamped itself as a lifestyle-heavy publication under the direction of David Granger.

==History==
&quot;Esquire&quot; was first issued in October 1933 as an offshoot of trade magazine &quot;Apparel Arts&quot; (which later became &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;; &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; would share ownership for almost 45 years). The magazine was first headquartered in Chicago and then, in New York City. It was founded and edited by David A. Smart, Henry L. Jackson and Arnold Gingrich. Jackson died in a plane crash in 1948, while Gingrich led the magazine until his own death in 1976. Smart died in 1952, although he left &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1936 to found a different magazine for the company, &quot;Coronet&quot;. The founders all had different focuses; Gingrich specialized in publishing, Smart led the business side of the magazine while Jackson led and edited the fashion section, which made up most of the magazine in its first fifteen years of publishing. Additionally, Jackson&#x27;s Republican political viewpoints contrasted with the liberal Democratic views of Smart, which allowed for the magazine to publish debates between the two.

&quot;Esquire&quot; initially was supposed to have a quarterly press run of a hundred thousand copies. It cost fifty cents per copy (equivalent to $ today). However, demand was so high that by its second issue (January 1934), it transformed itself into a more refined periodical with an emphasis on men&#x27;s fashion and contributions by Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Alberto Moravia, André Gide, and Julian Huxley.

In the 1940s, the popularity of the Petty Girls and Vargas Girls, particularly among the Armed Forces provided a circulation boost, but also proved controversial: in 1943, the Democratic United States Postmaster General Frank Comerford Walker brought charges against the magazine on behalf of the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which alleged that &quot;Esquire&quot; had used the US Postal Service to promote &quot;lewd images&quot;. Republicans opposed the lawsuit and in 1946 the United States Supreme Court found in &quot;Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc.&quot;, 327 U.S. 146 (1946), that &quot;Esquire&quot; right to use the Postal Service was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

During the 1950s, Al Moore replaced Petty and Vargas as the main pinup illustrator for &quot;Esquire&quot;. Petty illustrated for Esquire from 1933 to 1956, Vargas was hired to replace Petty in 1940 and was active until 1946.

Beginning with its second number, a blond, pop-eyed, mustachioed character named &quot;Esky&quot; (created by cartoonists E. Simms Campbell and Sam Berman), graced almost every &quot;Esquire&quot; front page for over a quarter of a century, depicting the refined character of the magazine and its readership, mostly in the form of figurines, although a stylized design of his face would often appear as well (replacing the figurines in the 1950s), and beginning in 1962, this graphic would be featured as the dot on the &quot;I&quot; of the logo until this was changed in 1978. After then, the character would be occasionally revived, most notably during the 1980s and 1990s, a short-lived &quot;Esky&quot; award given to popular rock bands during the 2000s and during Jay Fielden&#x27;s tenure in the 2010s.

Under Harold Hayes, who ran it from 1961 to 1973, &quot;Esquire&quot; became as distinctive as its oversized pages, helping pioneer the trend of New Journalism by publishing such writers as Norman Mailer, Tim O&#x27;Brien, John Sack, Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe, and Terry Southern. In the mid-1960s, &quot;Esquire&quot; partnered with Verve Records to release a series of &quot;Sound Tour&quot; vinyl LPs that provided advice and music for traveling abroad. In August 1969, &quot;Esquire&quot; published Normand Poirier&#x27;s piece, &quot;An American Atrocity&quot;, one of the first reports of American atrocities committed against Vietnamese civilians. Like many other magazines of the era, &quot;Esquire&quot; shrank from the traditional large-magazine format (about ) to the smaller standard letter size () in 1971.

The magazine was sold by the original owners to Clay Felker in 1977 (although Esquire Inc. kept its name until its acquisition by Gulf + Western in 1983). Felker reinvented the magazine as a fortnightly in 1978, under the title of &quot;Esquire Fortnightly&quot;, ditching the script logo that had been used (with minor tweaks) since 1933. However, the fortnightly experiment proved to be a failure, and by the end of that year, the magazine lost US$5 million. Felker sold &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1979 to the 13-30 Corporation, a Tennessee-based publisher, which reverted the magazine into a monthly, beginning with the July issue (dated both as of July 3 and 19). During this time, &quot;New York Woman&quot; magazine was launched as something of a spin-off version of &quot;Esquire&quot; aimed at a female audience. In 1986, the 13-30 Corporation (renamed as the Esquire Magazine Group) launched the &quot;New York Woman&quot; magazine as something of a spin-off version of &quot;Esquire&quot; aimed at a female audience. The company split up at the end of the year, and &quot;Esquire&quot; was sold to Hearst, with &quot;New York Woman&quot; going its separate way to American Express Publishing, being published until 1992.

The arrival of male-oriented lifestyle publications during the early 1990s and the problems of the magazine industry during the middle of the decade led to a sustained decline in circulation that threatened the future of &quot;Esquire&quot;, which had relied upon an elegant, highly-literate audience (until the late 1970s, it published a &quot;back-to-college&quot; issue each September, and during the second half of the 1980s it published a year-end register featuring leading cultural figures under 40 years of age) but did not appeal to younger men. David M. Granger was named editor-in-chief of the magazine in June 1997, fresh from a six-year stint at &quot;GQ,&quot; which he turned around from its fashion-heavy tradition. After his arrival, the magazine received numerous awards, including multiple National Magazine Awards. Its award-winning staff writers include Tom Chiarella, Scott Raab, Mike Sager, Chris Jones, John H. Richardson, Cal Fussman, Lisa Taddeo, and Tom Junod. Famous photographers have also worked for the magazine, among which fashion photographer Gleb Derujinsky, and Richard Avedon. In spite of its success, the magazine under Granger became increasingly criticized for its focus on the so-called metrosexual culture (a criticism he previously had late in his &quot;GQ&quot; tenure). David Granger stepped down in 2016, being replaced by Jay Fielden, who revamped the magazine into its more classical up-market style. At the same time, its political coverage became more comprehensive, following a trend among American magazine publications in general. After a series of shake-ups at Hearst&#x27;s magazine division, Michael Sebastian became editor in mid-2019, reverting to its 2000s-era style.

In September 2006, the magazine launched a special style-focused issue entitled &quot;The Big Black Book&quot;, which beginning in 2009 was published twice a year until the Spring/Summer issue ran for the last time in 2018.

In 2010, the June and July issues were merged as were the December and January issues in 2015, and in 2018 the magazine moved to eight issues per year.

==Blog==
In January 2009, &quot;Esquire&quot; launched a new blog—the &quot;Daily Endorsement Blog&quot;. Each morning the editors of the magazine recommend one thing for readers&#x27; immediate enjoyment: &quot;not a political candidate or position or party, but a breakthrough idea or product or Web site.&quot; The concept of the &quot;Daily Endorsement Blog&quot; was said to have emerged from &quot;Esquire&quot;″s November 2008 issue called the &quot;Endorsement Issue&quot;, in which, after 75 years, &quot;Esquire&quot; publicly endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time. The &quot;Daily Endorsement Blog&quot; was officially discontinued in April 2011.

==Fiction==
From 1969 to 1976, Gordon Lish served as fiction editor for &quot;Esquire&quot; and became known as &quot;Captain Fiction&quot; because of the authors whose careers he assisted. Lish helped establish the career of writer Raymond Carver by publishing his short stories in &quot;Esquire&quot;, often over the objections of Hayes. Lish is noted for encouraging Carver&#x27;s minimalism and publishing the short stories of Richard Ford. Using the influential publication as a vehicle to introduce new fiction by emerging authors, he promoted the work of such writers as T. Coraghessan Boyle, Barry Hannah, Cynthia Ozick, Reynolds Price and William Harrison.

In February 1977, &quot;Esquire&quot; published &quot;For Rupert – with no promises&quot; as an unsigned work of fiction: this was the first time it had published a work without identifying the author. Readers speculated that it was the work of J. D. Salinger, the reclusive author best known for &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Told in first-person, the story features events and Glass family names from the story &quot;For Esmé – with Love and Squalor&quot;. Gordon Lish is quoted as saying, &quot;I tried to borrow Salinger&#x27;s voice and the psychological circumstances of his life, as I imagine them to be now. And I tried to use those things to elaborate on certain circumstances and events in his fiction to deepen them and add complexity.&quot;

Other authors appearing in &quot;Esquire&quot; at that time included William F. Buckley, Truman Capote, Murray Kempton, Malcolm Muggeridge, Ron Rosenbaum, Andrew Vachss and Garry Wills.

During the mid-late 1980s, the magazine&#x27;s June &quot;Summer Reading&quot; issues featured a full-length fiction story accompanied by shorter pieces, all written for the magazine.

Although the magazine greatly reduced its fiction content during the 1990s in line with most other magazines, it has nevertheless continued to publish fiction in occasion. Writer Elizabeth Gilbert debuted in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1993, while Chris Adrian, Nathan Englander, Benjamin Percy, and Patrick Somerville among others have also contributed to the magazine. Other writers who have recently appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot; include Ralph Lombreglia, James Lee Burke, and Stephen King.

===The Napkin Fiction Project===
In 2007, &quot;Esquire&quot; launched the Napkin Fiction Project, in which 250 cocktail napkins were mailed to writers all over the country by the incoming fiction editor, in a playful attempt to revive short fiction—&quot;some with a half dozen books to their name, others just finishing their first&quot;. In return, the magazine received nearly a hundred stories. Rick Moody, Jonathan Ames, Bret Anthony Johnston, Joshua Ferris, Yiyun Li, Aimee Bender, and ZZ Packer are among the notable writers included.

==Dubious Achievement Awards==
For many years, &quot;Esquire&quot; has published its annual &quot;Dubious Achievement Awards&quot;, lampooning events of the preceding year. As a running gag, the annual article almost always displayed an old photo of Richard Nixon laughing, with the caption, &quot;Why is this man laughing?&quot; However, the February 2006 &quot;Dubious Achievement Awards&quot; used the caption under a photo of W. Mark Felt, the former FBI official revealed in 2005 to be &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, the source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein to uncover the Watergate scandal. The magazine discontinued the Nixon photo in February 2007, referring to a poll stating that George W. Bush had surpassed Nixon as the &quot;worst president ever&quot;.

A popular running gag featured in the &quot;Dubious Achievements of 1990&quot; edition involved especially egregious achievements headlined with &quot;And then they went to Elaine&#x27;s.&quot;, referring to a popular restaurant in New York City that closed in May 2011.

&quot;Esquire&quot; did not publish &quot;Dubious Achievement Awards&quot; for 2001, but resumed them with the 2002 awards, published in the February 2003 issue.

&quot;Dubious Achievement Awards&quot; were discontinued in 2008, according to an editor&#x27;s note in the January 2008 issue, considering that the overabundance of imitators had made the feature superfluous. However, after a nine-year hiatus, the feature was revived in the January 2017 issue with a skewering of 2016 events.

==Sexiest Woman Alive==
The annual Sexiest Woman Alive feature ran between 2003 and 2015, billed as a benchmark of female attractiveness and consisting of a photoshoot and profile of the winning woman. Originally, it was a part of the &quot;Women We Love&quot; issue that had appeared yearly since 1988 (after being a section of &quot;The Passions of Men&quot; issue, June 1987), being initially titled &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. To build interest, the magazine would do a tease, releasing partial images of the woman in the issues preceding the November issue. By 2007, it had become the dominating story of the issue and to create an element of surprise the hints were abandoned.

The feature was criticized for objectifying women. In a &quot;Slate&quot; article following Penélope Cruz&#x27;s 2014 Sexiest Woman Alive profile, Katy Waldman called the article the &quot;latest icky entry in the icky genre&quot; and describing it as using &quot;rapt, creepy, overheated language to say practically nothing about his subject, except that she is &#x27;impossibly beautiful,&#x27; &#x27;has no physical flaws,&#x27; &#x27;looks like a thousand different women,&#x27; and &#x27;can be whatever we want her to be.&#x27; (So, nothing.)&quot;. Waldman said the profiles &quot;traffic in weirdo pious metaphors and exaggerations that aim to winkingly indicate how overcome a guy gets in the face of a gorgeous lady. But they just make men seem like drooling louts.&quot;

<doc id="244004" wikidata="Q1072906" url="?curid=244004" title="Lapageria">
<text>Lapageria is a genus of flowering plants with only one known species, Lapageria rosea, commonly known as Chilean bellflower or copihue (&quot;copeewueh&quot;, from Mapudungun &quot;kopiwe&quot;). &quot;Lapageria rosea&quot; is endemic to Chile and it is the national flower of this country. It grows in forests in the southern part of Chile, being part of the Valdivian temperate rainforests ecoregion flora.

==Description==
&quot;Lapageria rosea&quot; is an evergreen climbing plant reaching over high among shrubs and trees. The leaves are arranged alternately and are evergreen, leathery, lanceolate and feature three to seven prominent parallel veins. The vines twine counterclockwise in the Southern hemisphere and clockwise when grown in the Northern hemisphere (likely due to the apparent motion of the sun).

The flowers have six thick, waxy tepals which are most commonly red, spotted with white. They are most frequently produced in late summer and fall, although they may be produced at other times. The fruit is an elongated berry with a tough skin containing numerous small seeds about the size of a tomato seed, which are covered in an edible fleshy arils. In the wild the plant is pollinated by hummingbirds.

===Pollination===
Pollen is distributed by birds, mostly hummingbirds, and also insects and other animals. The flower form is of the syndrome of specialization for hummingbird pollination. Insect pollinators include: &quot;Bombus dahlbomii&quot; (native species to southern South America) and &quot;Bombus terrestris&quot; and &quot;Bombus ruderatus&quot; (both of which are not native to southern South America, and, instead, invasive).

==Historical usage==
In the past its fruit was sold in markets, but the plant has now become rare through over-collection and forest clearance.

The roots were once collected and used as a substitute for sarsaparilla. In 1977 the plant was given legal protection in Chile.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lapageria&quot; is named for Marie Joséphine Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (1763-1814), also known as Napoleon&#x27;s Empress Josephine, who was a keen collector of plants for her garden at Château de Malmaison. &quot;Rosea&quot; means &#x27;flushed rose&#x27; or &#x27;flushed pink&#x27;.

The name of the fruit in Mapudungun is actually &quot;kopiw&quot; (derived from &quot;kopün&quot;, &quot;to be upside down&quot;), which is the etymon of Spanish &quot;copihue&quot;; the Mapuche call the plant &quot;kolkopiw&quot; (&quot;colcopihue&quot; in Spanish, which may also refer to the whole plant). The flower is called &quot;kodkülla&quot; in the indigenous language.

==Botany==
&quot;Lapageria rosea&quot; is related to &quot;Philesia magellanica&quot; (syn. &quot;P. buxifolia&quot;), another plant from the Valdivian flora, having similar flowers, but shrubby rather than climbing. ×&quot;Philageria veitchii&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;L. rosea&quot; and &quot;P. magellanica&quot;. It is more similar in appearance to the former.

==Cultivation==
The plant was introduced to Britain by William Lobb during his plant collecting expedition to the Valdivian temperate rain forests in 1845–1848 and was growing at Kew in 1847.

In cultivation the plant requires a shaded, sheltered position with acid or neutral soil. It is hardy down to , so in the UK can be grown outside in mild or coastal areas. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Cultivars===
There are numerous named garden cultivars, mostly developed at one nursery in Chile, with flower colour varying from deep red through pink to pure white (&quot;L. rosea&quot; &#x27;Albiflora&#x27;), and some with variegated flowers.

In the United States, UC Botanical Garden at the University of California at Berkeley has one of the largest collections of the &quot;Lapageria&quot; genus with around 24 named and unnamed cultivars in its collection. This collection was started by T Harper Goodspeed, botany professor at UCB and alternately curator or director of the gardens from 1919–1957. The University established a relationship with El Vergel Farm, a Methodist mission and agricultural school in Angol, Chile which housed the largest collection of named cultivars and wild lapagerias in the world.

===Propagation===
To obtain fruit in cultivation it is generally necessary to pollinate by hand if there are not native hummingbirds. Chilean bellflower can be propagated from cuttings, layering and fresh seeds. Some cultivars are self-fruitful, but better pollination is achieved with differing parents. Germination is best with fresh moist seed; dried seeds take special treatment and have a much poorer germination rate. Propagation of cultivars is by cuttings (usually rooted under mist), layering, or division. Seedlings take from three to ten years to flower. Cuttings usually flower more quickly.

<text>Coburg () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Kronach, Lichtenfels, Bamberg and Haßberge, and by the state of Thuringia (districts Hildburghausen and Sonneberg). The district surrounds, but does not include the city of Coburg.

== History ==
The city of Coburg has largely influenced the history of the district. From 1826 to 1918, the region was part of the small duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (see Thuringia). In a referendum from 1919, the Coburg portion of this state decided to join Bavaria (united in 1920). The present district is identical to that portion but excludes Coburg and the exclave of Königsberg, which is part of Haßberge district. The city of Neustadt was a district-free city until 1972 and was then incorporated into the district.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the hilly country between the Thuringian Slate Mountains and the Main valley.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €27,145. This places the district 89th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

== Coat of arms ==
The arms consist of the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria and the arms of the Wettin dynasty of Saxony. These arms represent the historic affiliations to both states.

<text>Donát Bánki (born as Donát Lőwinger, 6 June 1859 – 1 August 1922)
was a Hungarian mechanical engineer and inventor of Jewish heritage. In 1893 he invented the carburetor for the stationary engine, together with János Csonka (known as the Bánki-Csonka engine). The invention is often, incorrectly credited to the German Wilhelm Maybach, who submitted his patent half a year after Bánki and Csonka. Bánki also greatly contributed to the design of compressors for combustion engines. 

In 1898, Donát Bánki invented the high-compression engine with a dual carburetor, an evaporation method used ever since.

The invention of the carburetor helped the development of automobiles, as previously no method was known to correctly mix the fuel and air for engines.

Some sources say that the idea of the carburetor came from a flower girl. One evening, Bánki saw her while walking home from the Budapest Technical University. She was sprinkling water onto her flowers by blowing spray from her mouth.

Bánki is also given partial credit for the invention of the crossflow turbine.

<text>Fred McDowell (January 12, 1904 – July 3, 1972), known by his stage name Mississippi Fred McDowell, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist of hill country blues music.

==Career==
McDowell was born in Rossville, Tennessee. His parents were farmers, who both died while Fred was in his youth. He took up the guitar at the age of 14 and was soon playing for tips at dances around Rossville. Seeking a change from plowing fields, he moved to Memphis in 1926, where he worked in the Buck-Eye feed mill, which processed cotton into oil and other products. In 1928, he moved to Mississippi to pick cotton. He finally settled in Como, Mississippi, around 1940, where he worked as a full-time farmer for many years while continuing to play music on weekends at dances and picnics.

After decades of playing for small local gatherings, McDowell was recorded in 1959 by roving folklore musicologist Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins, on their Southern Journey field-recording trip. With interest in blues and folk music rising in the United States at the time, McDowell&#x27;s field recordings for Lomax caught the attention of blues aficionados and record producers, and within a couple of years, he had finally become a professional musician and recording artist in his own right. His LPs proved quite popular, and he performed at festivals and clubs all over the world.

McDowell continued to perform the blues in the north Mississippi style much as he had for decades, sometimes on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. He was particularly renowned for his mastery of slide guitar, a style he said he first learned using a pocketknife for a slide and later a polished beef rib bone. He ultimately settled on the clearer sound he got from a glass slide, which he wore on his ring finger. While he famously declared, &quot;I do not play no rock and roll,&quot; he was not averse to associating with younger rock musicians. He coached Bonnie Raitt on slide guitar technique and was reportedly flattered by the Rolling Stones&#x27; rather straightforward version of his &quot;You Gotta Move&quot; on their 1971 album &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. In 1965, he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival, together with Big Mama Thornton, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Roosevelt Sykes and others.

McDowell&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;I Do Not Play No Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, recorded at Malaco Studios in Jackson, Mississippi, and released by Capitol Records, was his first featuring electric guitar. It contains parts of an interview in which he discusses the origins of the blues and the nature of love. His live album &quot;Live at the Mayfair Hotel&quot; (1995) was from a concert he gave in 1969. Tracks included versions of Bukka White&#x27;s &quot;Shake &#x27;Em On Down&quot;, Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;My Babe&quot;, Mance Lipscomb&#x27;s &quot;Evil Hearted Woman&quot;, plus McDowell&#x27;s self-penned &quot;Kokomo Blues.&quot; AllMusic noted that the album &quot;may be the best single CD in McDowell&#x27;s output, and certainly his best concert release&quot;. McDowell&#x27;s final album, &quot;Live in New York&quot; (Oblivion Records), was a concert performance from November 1971 at the Village Gaslight (also known as The Gaslight Cafe), in Greenwich Village, New York.

McDowell&#x27;s version of the folk song &quot;John Henry&quot; from 1969 is included on the &quot;Ann Arbor Blues Festival 1969: Vols 1&amp;2,&quot; 2019 release.

McDowell died of cancer in 1972, aged 68, and was buried at Hammond Hill Baptist Church, between Como and Senatobia, Mississippi. On August 6, 1993, a memorial was placed on his grave by the Mount Zion Memorial Fund. The ceremony was presided over by the blues promoter Dick Waterman, and the memorial with McDowell&#x27;s portrait on it was paid for by Bonnie Raitt. The memorial stone was a replacement for an inaccurate (McDowell&#x27;s name was misspelled) and damaged marker. The original stone was subsequently donated by McDowell&#x27;s family to the Delta Blues Museum, in Clarksdale, Mississippi. McDowell was a Freemason and was associated with Prince Hall Freemasonry; he was buried in Masonic regalia.

<doc id="244027" wikidata="Q2702796" url="?curid=244027" title="Phytohaemagglutinin">
<text>Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, or phytohemagglutinin) is a lectin found in plants, especially certain legumes. PHA actually consists of two closely related proteins, called leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and PHA-E. These proteins cause blood cells to clump together. PHA-E cause erythrocytes (red blood cells) to clump. PHA-L causes leukocytes (white blood cells) to clump. Phytohaemagglutinin has carbohydrate-binding specificity for a complex oligosaccharide containing
galactose, &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine, and mannose.

It is found in the highest concentrations in uncooked red kidney beans and white kidney beans (also known as cannellini), and it is also found in lower quantities in many other types of green beans and other common beans (&quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;), as well as broad beans (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;) such as fava beans. It has a number of physiological effects and is used in medical research. In high doses, it is a toxin.

The lectin has a number of effects on cell metabolism; it induces mitosis, and affects the cell membrane in regard to transport and permeability to proteins. It agglutinates most mammalian red blood cell types.

== Toxicity ==
As a toxin, it can cause poisoning in monogastric animals, such as humans, through the consumption of raw or improperly prepared legumes, &quot;e.g.&quot;, beans. Measured in haemagglutinating units (hau), a raw red kidney bean may contain up to 70,000 hau, but this is reduced to between 200 and 400 hau when properly cooked. Studies by British scientists recommend soaking beans for at least five hours, discarding the water, and then boiling the beans in fresh water at for at least thirty minutes. A pressure cooker at 15 psi may be used to cook beans in 45 minutes without presoaking. Insufficient cooking, such as in a slow cooker at 75 °C/ 167 °F, may not completely destroy the toxins.

Beans also contain alpha amylase inhibitor, but not in sufficient quantities to affect the digestion of starch after consumption of beans.

Poisoning can be induced from as few as four raw beans. Symptoms usually begin with extreme nausea and vomiting within one to three hours of ingestion, followed by diarrhea. Abdominal pain has been reported in some people. Recovery is usually spontaneous and rapid, occurring within three to four hours after onset of symptoms, although some cases have required hospitalization.

== Uses ==
In medicine these proteins are useful and are used as a mitogen to trigger T-lymphocyte cell division and to activate latent HIV-1 from human peripheral lymphocytes. In neuroscience, anterograde tracing is a research method that uses the protein product phytohaemagglutinin PHA-L as a molecular tracer that can be taken up by the cell and transported across the synapse into the next cell thereby tracing the path of axonal projections and relative connections that nerve impulses travel beginning with the source located at the perikaryon (cell body or soma) and through the presynaptic part located on neuron&#x27;s efferent axon all the way to the point of termination at the efferent synapse which then provides input to another neuron.

Lymphocytes cultured with phytohaemagglutinin can be used for karyotype analysis. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes by phytohaemagglutinin presents a classic model of transition of cells from the quiescent G0 phase of the cell cycle into G1-, and subsequently progression through S-, G2- and M- phases of the cycle.

== History ==
Prior to 1960, crude extracts of PHA were known to coat the surface of red blood cells, make them heavier, and thereby improve the separation of the white cell buffy coat. Peter Nowell, an immunologist and pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was using PHA for this purpose in 1960 when he discovered it also had the ability to stimulate mitotic division of lymphocytes from normal peripheral blood. Prior to his discovery, these cells were assumed to be the terminal end-products of differentiation. This work had tremendous implications for the constitutional study of chromosomal disorders. T. C. Hsu&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Human and Mammalian Cytogenetics an Historical Perspective&quot; (ISBN 978-1-4612-6159-9) is an excellent resource for this history.

<text>This is a list of men&#x27;s magazines from around the world. These are magazines (periodical print publications) that have been published primarily for a readership of men.

The list has been split into subcategories according to the target audience of the magazines. This list includes adult magazines. Not included here are magazines which may happen to have, or may be assumed to have, a predominantly male audience - such as magazines focusing on cars, trains, modelbuilding and gadgets. The list excludes online publications.

==General male audience==
These publications appeal to a broad male audience. Some skew toward men&#x27;s fashion, others to health. Most are marketed to a particular age and income demographic. In the United States, some are marketed mainly to a specific ethnic group, such as African Americans or Mexicans.

==Men&#x27;s lifestyle magazines==
&quot;Men&#x27;s lifestyle&quot; magazines (&quot;lad mags&quot; in the UK and specifically &quot;men&#x27;s magazines&quot; in North America) were popular in the 1990 and 2000s, focusing on a mix of &quot;sex, sport, gadgets and grooming tips&quot;. From the early 2000s, sales of these magazines declined very substantially as the internet provided the same content (and particularly more graphic pornography) for free.

<doc id="244039" wikidata="Q985834" url="?curid=244039" title="Shogi variant">
<text>A shogi variant is a game related to or derived from shogi (Japanese chess). Many shogi variants have been developed over the centuries, ranging from some of the largest chess-type games ever played to some of the smallest. A few of these variants are still regularly played, though none are as popular as shogi itself.

The drop rule, often considered the most notable feature of shogi, is absent from most shogi variants, which therefore play more like other forms of chess, with the board becoming less crowded as pieces are exchanged. This is especially true for variants larger than shogi itself. In fact, the largest well-known variant that features the drop rule is the 11×11 game wa shogi.

== Predecessors of modern shogi ==

Some form of chess had almost certainly reached Japan by the 9th century, if not earlier, but the earliest surviving Japanese description of the rules of chess dates from the early 12th century, during the Heian period. Unfortunately, this description does not give enough information to play the game, but this has not stopped people from trying to reconstruct this early form of shogi, which is usually referred to as Heian shogi (平安将棋). Piece movements were as in modern shogi, but there was no rook or bishop. The board appears to have been either 9×8 or 8×8. The setup is unknown, but can reasonably be assumed to have been the same as in modern shogi (minus the rook and bishop, and minus a gold general in the 8×8 case), but possibly the pawns started on the second rank rather than the third. It can safely be assumed that the game was played without drops, since the weak pieces promote strictly to gold, instead of just moving like gold.

By the 16th century the game had taken a form closer to the modern game: it was played on a 9×9 board with the same setup as in modern shogi except that an extra piece (an elephant) stood in front of the king. This form of the game is known as sho shogi (小将棋), which means &quot;small shogi&quot;. (While 9×9 may not seem small, despite the name, it was smaller than the other shogi variants prevalent at the time.) The elephant was eliminated by the Emperor Go-Nara (reign 1526–1557), and it is assumed that the drop rule was introduced at about the same time, giving rise to shogi as we know it today.

=== Historical variants ===

There are a number of shogi variants played on boards larger than 9×9. These variants are all quite old, and were possibly all played without drops. Michael C. Vanier says, &quot;It is thought that the really huge games (dai dai and up) were never really played to any significant extent [...] and were devised merely so that the creators could have the fun of inventing enormous games, amazing their friends and confounding their enemies. However, the games up to tenjiku shogi at least appear to be quite playable, assuming one has the time.&quot;

The same 12th-century document which describes the Heian form of shogi also describes a variant played on a 13×13 board, which is now called Heian dai shogi (平安大将棋). As with the smaller Heian shogi, the rules for this game have not been completely preserved.

The most popular large-board variant is chu shogi (中将棋), played on a 12×12 board. The name means medium shogi, and the game is sometimes so called (or called middle shogi) in English. Chu shogi has existed since at least the 14th century; there are earlier references, but it is not clear that they refer to the game as we now know it. Chu shogi is best known for a piece called the lion, which moves like a king but twice per turn. The game was still commonly played in Japan in the early 20th century, but has now largely died out. It has, however, gained some adherents in the West. The main reference work in English is the &quot;Middle Shogi Manual&quot; by George Hodges.

Other large medieval shogi variants were wa shogi (11×11, sometimes played with drops), dai shogi (大将棋, &quot;great shogi&quot;, 15×15), tenjiku shogi (天竺将棋, literally &quot;Indian shogi&quot;, but meant &quot;exotic shogi&quot;, 16×16), dai dai shogi (大大将棋, &quot;great great shogi&quot;, 17×17), maka dai dai shogi (摩訶大大将棋, &quot;ultra great great shogi&quot;, 19×19) and tai shogi (泰将棋, &quot;grand shogi&quot;, 25×25). These variants date back at least to the 17th century. Tai shogi was thought to be the world&#x27;s largest chess variant, but recently records of an even larger variant, taikyoku shogi (大局将棋, &quot;ultimate shogi&quot;, 36×36), was discovered. However, there is no evidence that any of them were commonly played apart from dai shogi. While a few sets for dai dai shogi, maka dai dai shogi, and tai shogi are known to have been made, they appear to have been intended as display pieces and not for actual playing. Furthermore, the sources for the rules of almost all the larger variants tend to disagree with each other on many particular issues, even including the very moves of the pieces, such that only for chu shogi and dai shogi is it well-known what the historical rules were, and some small lacunae still arise in the latter with rare situations.
Of the historical large-board variants, only wa (11×11), chu (12×12), tenjiku (16×16), and maka dai dai shogi (19×19) have gained a limited following today. There is a society for chu shogi in Japan, as well as some efforts to revive maka dai dai shogi, though both efforts have changed the rules slightly from the historical ones – more significantly for maka dai dai shogi, unlike for chu shogi whose former popularity still lies within living memory. Tenjiku shogi gained some Western following around the turn of the millennium, although not with the historical rules.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
== Modern variants ==
These are some of the new and old shogi variants which have been invented. Time will show which if any of the many recently invented variants stand the test of usage and competition from other games, and stay in use.

=== Small variants ===

=== Standard-size variants ===
=== Large variants ===

The most recent traditional large board variant is ko shogi (廣将棋 or 廣象棋 &quot;wide shogi&quot;, 19×19), which is played on a go board and incorporates elements of Chinese chess. Ko shogi is unusual for the interdependence of its pieces and the complex rules of promotion, but likewise there is no evidence that it was ever played.

<text>Glenard Paul (Glen) Lipscomb (August 19, 1915 – February 1, 1970) was a United States Congressman from the state of California from 1953 to 1970.

==Biography ==

Born in Jackson, Michigan, Lipscomb moved to California with his parents in 1920, where the family settled in Los Angeles. He was educated in the Los Angeles public schools, including Belmont High School (Los Angeles, California). After attending the University of Southern California and Woodbury College (now in Burbank), he became an accountant.

He served in the Army&#x27;s Financial Corps during World War II and in 1947 was elected to the California State Assembly 56th district, where he served until 1953.

===Congress ===
That year he won a special election to the U.S. House to replace Norris Poulson (who had been elected mayor of Los Angeles), representing California&#x27;s twenty-fourth district. Lipscomb voted for the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968.

===Death ===
Lipscomb continued to serve in the House for the rest of his life. He died of cancer at Bethesda Naval Hospital at the age of 54 on February 1, 1970 and was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park-Hollywood Hills. The submarine USS &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was named after him.

He was married to Virginia Sognalian Lipscomb, a classmate at Belmont High.

For a short time a BSA camp near Big Bear Lake was named after him: Camp Lipscomb.

<doc id="244047" wikidata="Q1062313" url="?curid=244047" title="Polynesian sandpiper">
<text>The Polynesian sandpipers form the genus Prosobonia. They are small wading birds confined to remote Pacific islands of French Polynesia. Only one species is now extant, and it is rare and little known. This bird is sometimes separated in the genus &quot;Aechmorhynchus&quot;, restricting the genus to the extinct southern forms.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Prosobonia&quot; was introduced in 1850 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte with the Tahiti sandpiper, as the type species. Bonaparte did not explain the etymology of the genus name but it is probably from the Ancient Greek &quot;prosōpon&quot; meaning &quot;mask&quot; or &quot;face&quot;.

The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union lists four species in the genus. Of these three have become extinct in historical times.
* Tuamotu sandpiper, &quot;P. parvirostris&quot;
* † Kiritimati sandpiper, &quot;P. cancellata&quot;
* † Tahiti sandpiper, &quot;P. leucoptera&quot;
* † Moorea sandpiper, &quot;P. ellisi&quot; 
An additional species was described in 2020 from subfossil remains.
* † Henderson sandpiper &quot;P. sauli&quot; 
Indeterminate species are also known from the Marquesas and the Cook Islands.

==Description==
The Tuamotu sandpiper, &quot;P. parvirostris&quot;, is a unique short-billed all-brown wader previously found over a large area of the Pacific, but now confined to a few islands in the Tuamotu archipelago and still declining. Its decline appears to be due to human habitation encroachment and introduced mammals. It feeds on insects, but takes some vegetable material from its coastal haunts. It nests on the ground, and has a soft piping call.

The extinct Tahiti sandpiper, &quot;P. leucoptera&quot; of Tahiti was similar in size and shape to &quot;P. cancellata&quot;. It had brown upperparts, reddish underparts, a white wingbar, and some white on the face and throat. It became extinct in the 19th century, and little is known of it.

There was a similar bird on Moorea which differed in some minor details from &quot;P. leucoptera&quot;, notably the larger extent of white in the wing, and has been described as the Moorea sandpiper (&quot;P. ellisi&quot;). However, although two species are generally listed, the question whether they actually did constitute separate species is probably unresolvable as only a single specimen of it exists today, apart from some contemporary paintings.

From Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Ua Huka in the Marquesas, and the remote South Pacific Henderson Island subfossil remains of &quot;Prosobonia&quot; have been recovered but not yet named. The first of these was almost certainly more closely related to the Tahiti and Moorea populations than to the Tuamotu sandpiper, but the exact nature of their relationship is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. It disappeared in the early-mid 1st millennium AD, probably not long after 300 AD.

The Ua Huka and Henderson forms can be assumed to have been closer to the living species. The latter, a distinct species with long legs and short wings, became extinct only about 1000 years after the Mangaia form, some time after 1200.

In 2020 a new extinct species, &quot;Prosobonia sauli&quot;, was described from specimens found on Henderson Island, part of the Pitcairn Islands. A genetic analysis found that the genus was sister to the clade containing &quot;Arenaria&quot; and &quot;Calidris&quot;.

<text>The Moorea Sandpiper (Prosobonia ellisi) is an extinct member of the large wader family Scolopacidae that was endemic to Mo&#x27;orea in French Polynesia, where the locals called it te-te in the Tahitian language.

Two specimens were collected by Georg Forster and William Anderson between September 30 and October 11, 1777, during Captain Cook&#x27;s third voyage, but both have since disappeared and the bird became extinct in the nineteenth century. Several drawings of the bird were made by those accompanying Cook on his voyage; William Ellis and John Webber both illustrated the sandpiper between August-December of 1777. 

These illustrations show a somewhat lighter brown bird than the Tahiti Sandpiper, with no white spot behind the eye, a more conspicuous light rusty eye-ring, two white wing-bars and rusty secondary and primary coverts; one of Latham&#x27;s specimens had yellow legs and feet. The exact relationships between the Moorea and Tahiti specimens are still not fully resolved, with some being unsure if they are separate species.

The Moorea Sandpiper was said to be found &quot;close to small brooks&quot; and it was still at least moderately common around 1776 - 1779 during Cook&#x27;s last voyage. Invasive rats may have been a contributing factor in its fall to extinction.

<text>The Conn Smythe Trophy () is awarded annually to the most valuable player (MVP) of his team during the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Stanley Cup playoffs. It is named after Conn Smythe, the longtime owner, general manager, and head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Conn Smythe Trophy has been awarded 54 times to 47 players since the 1964–65 NHL season. Each year, at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley Cup Finals, members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association vote to elect the player deserving of the trophy. The trophy is handed out by the NHL Commissioner before the presentation of the Stanley Cup and only the winner is announced, in contrast to most of the other NHL awards which name three finalists and are presented at a ceremony. Vote tallies for the Conn Smythe Trophy were released starting in 2017.

Unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada (the Super Bowl MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, the MLS Cup MVP and the World Series MVP), the Conn Smythe is based on a player&#x27;s performance during the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series.

The most recent winner is Connor McDavid. He is only the sixth player in NHL history to be awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy while being on the losing team. The last player to do it before him was Jean-Sebastien Giguere in 2003.

==History==
The Conn Smythe Trophy was introduced in 1964 by Maple Leaf Gardens Limited to honour Conn Smythe, the former owner, general manager and coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder. The centrepiece of the trophy is a stylized silver replica of Maple Leaf Gardens, the arena built under Smythe&#x27;s ownership of the Maple Leafs, and their home from 1931 to 1999. Backing the arena replica is a large silver botanically accurate maple leaf. The arena replica and leaf are set atop a square wooden foundation, the front of which bears a dedication plaque. Additional tiers below the foundation, sloping outward, contain maple leaf-shaped plates bearing the inscriptions of the winners&#x27; names.

The base of the Conn Smythe Trophy has been expanded twice over the years to accommodate more winners. Although the 16 nameplates on the original base tier were filled up after 1980, a new tier was not added until the 1983–84 season. Following the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the 20 nameplates on the new tier were filled, so the first nine winners&#x27; nameplates were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier. The remaining nameplates were shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004–05 season, the trophy was not filled again until 2010, after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.

The first winner of the trophy was centre Jean Beliveau of the Montreal Canadiens in 1965. The first player and only defenseman to win it twice was Bobby Orr, who scored the Cup-clinching goals for the Boston Bruins in 1970 and 1972. Goaltender Bernie Parent (for the Philadelphia Flyers) and centres Wayne Gretzky (for the Edmonton Oilers), Mario Lemieux, and Sidney Crosby (for the Pittsburgh Penguins) have also won it twice each, with Parent, Lemieux, and Crosby each winning theirs back to back (1974/1975, 1991/1992, and 2016/2017 respectively). Goaltender Patrick Roy is the only three-time Smythe winner and the only player to win the trophy as a member of two different teams (with the Canadiens in 1986 and 1993, and with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001); his wins also fall into three different decades. Ken Dryden, the 1971 Smythe winner, is the only NHL player to win this trophy before winning the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year (in 1972): Montreal called him up to play only six regular season games. Dave Keon is the only Maple Leafs player to win the trophy donated by his club&#x27;s parent company, while his eight playoff points in 1967 is the fewest ever by a non-goalie Conn Smythe winner as he was a defensive forward.

Though the trophy rewards a player who performed particularly well over the entirety of the playoffs, it has never been given to a player whose team did not at least reach the Stanley Cup Finals. The trophy has been awarded to members of the team that lost the Finals six times, most recently Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers in 2024. The only two skaters to win the award while his team lost the final round are Edmonton&#x27;s Connor McDavid and Philadelphia&#x27;s Reggie Leach, the latter of which won it in 1976, as he had set a league record for most goals in the playoffs (19), which included a five-goal game in the semifinals and four goals in the Finals, even though the Canadiens swept his Flyers. McDavid set the all-time playoff record for assists in 2024 and led the playoffs in scoring by ten points, despite the Florida Panthers defeating his Oilers in seven games.

Ten players born outside of Canada have won the Conn Smythe Trophy. The non-Canadian winners are Americans Brian Leetch, who won it in 1994, Tim Thomas in 2011, Jonathan Quick in 2012, and Patrick Kane in 2013; Russians Evgeni Malkin, Alexander Ovechkin and Andrei Vasilevskiy who won it in 2009, 2018 and 2021, respectively; and Swedes Nicklas Lidstrom, Henrik Zetterberg and Victor Hedman, who won it in 2002, 2008 and 2020, respectively.

Three players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player during the regular season in the same year: Orr in 1970 and 1972, Guy Lafleur in 1977, and Wayne Gretzky in 1985. These three players also won the Art Ross Trophy, having scored more points than any other player during the regular season (Orr only in 1970), while Orr also won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman to give him a record four individual original NHL awards in 1970.

As of 2024, the Conn Smythe Trophy has been awarded to centers 20 times, to goaltenders 17 times, to defencemen 12 times, and to right wingers eight times, while the only left wingers to have won the award are Bob Gainey of Montreal in 1979 and Alexander Ovechkin of Washington in 2018. Players with the Montreal Canadiens have received the most Conn Smythe Trophies with nine. Players with the Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Edmonton Oilers have each received five, and the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Islanders have each received four.

<text>In British maritime law and custom, an ensign is the identifying flag flown to designate a British ship, either military or civilian. Such flags display the United Kingdom Union Flag in the canton (the upper corner next to the staff), with either a red, white or blue field, dependent on whether the vessel is civilian, naval, or in a special category. These are known as the &quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; ensigns respectively.

Outside the nautical sphere, ensigns are used to designate many other military units, government departments and administrative divisions. These flags are modelled on the red, white, and blue naval ensigns, but may use different colours for the field, and be defaced by the addition of a badge or symbol, for example the sky blue with concentric red, white and blue circles of the Royal Air Force ensign.

The Union Flag (also known as the &quot;Union Jack&quot;) should be flown as a jack by Royal Navy ships only when moored or at anchor. If flown while underway, the ship must be dressed for a special occasion or celebration with masthead ensigns, otherwise it signals that the monarch or an Admiral of the Fleet is on board. The Union Flag may also signal that a court martial is in progress.

The use of the Union Flag as an ensign on a civilian craft is still illegal, unless it has a white border, ever since CharlesI ordered it be restricted to His Majesty&#x27;s ships &quot;upon pain of Our high displeasure&quot; in the 17th century, mainly due to its unauthorised use by merchant mariners to avoid paying harbour duties by passing themselves off as royal vessels.

==Modern usage==
British ensigns currently in use can be classified into five categories, in descending order of exclusivity:
* the White Ensign
* the Blue Ensign
* the Blue Ensign defaced
* the Red Ensign
* the Red Ensign defaced

The traditional order of seniority was red, white and blue, with the red as the senior ensign.

==White==

Today&#x27;s white ensign, as used by Royal Navy ships, incorporates the St George&#x27;s Cross (St George&#x27;s Ensign). British yachts owned by members of the Royal Yacht Squadron are authorised to apply for a permit to wear this ensign. Defaced white ensigns include that of the British Antarctic Territory.

Since the reorganisation of the Royal Navy in 1864, use of the White Ensign (a red St George&#x27;s Cross on a white field with the Union Flag in the canton) has been restricted to ships, boats, submarines and on-shore establishments of the Royal Navy. The Royal Yacht Squadron also fly the white ensign by special dispensation.

==Blue==

The Blue Ensign (dark blue field with the Union Flag in the canton) undefaced is worn by masters of vessels in possession of a warrant issued by the Director of Naval Reserves, and by the members of certain yacht clubs. Such warrants are issued to officers in the active or retired lists of the Royal Naval Reserve and the maritime reserve forces of other Commonwealth realms and territories. The master must be of the rank of lieutenant RN or above, and fishing vessels must be crewed by at least four other Royal Naval reservists or pensioners. The Ensign of the Sea Cadet Corps is a blue ensign defaced by the SCC badge. Under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Defence, officers of the Sea Cadet Corps hold their ranks as (SCC) RNR on a &#x27;nominal honorific&#x27; basis, and are included on the Navy List as a courtesy (though they are not commissioned, but &#x27;appointed&#x27; within the Corps).

===Defaced===
British government departments use a variety of blue ensigns defaced in the fly with the department badge, and colonial governments use blue ensigns defaced with the colonial badge. Other defaced ensigns were used by vessels of the Port of London Authority, Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Humber Conservancy, Custom House, the Board of Trade, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, the Post Office, submarine cable laying ships, and other departments including War Office Ordnance. The flag of Australia and those of its states as well as the flag of New Zealand are defaced blue ensigns. Several yacht clubs are also entitled to fly blue ensigns defaced by their club badge.

==Red==

The Red Ensign (red field with the Union Flag in the canton) defaced by a badge is flown by Trinity House and various organisations and yacht clubs. Merchant ships and private vessels registered in British territories and dependencies, and in several Commonwealth realms, fly the Red Ensign defaced by the badge of their territory.

The Red Ensign undefaced is for the use of all other British merchant navy ships and private craft. The Red Ensign is the correct flag to be worn as courtesy flag by foreign private vessels in United Kingdom waters. Merchant vessels from British overseas territories and Crown dependencies are entitled to red ensigns defaced with the badge of their territory.

==Other ensigns==
The flag of the British East India Company, like the Cambridge or Grand Union Flag of the American colonies, had a red and white striped field. There were similar red-and-white and green-and-white striped ensigns in the English Navy in the 16th century. Similarly in flag plates from the 17th and 18th centuries there are representations of the Guinea Jack of the Royal Africa Company in various forms; the jack consisted of St George&#x27;s Cross within a double border of red and white chequers. The flag of Hawaii is a British ensign with a background of white, red and blue stripes.

Also in existence is a Royal Air Force (RAF) ensign and a civil air ensign, both of which have a sky-blue field, with the Union Flag in the canton. The RAF Ensign is defaced with the red-white-blue RAF roundel, while the field of the civil air ensign is charged with a large dark-blue cross fimbriated white. During World War II, the Belgian section of the RAF used a variant of RAF Ensign defaced with the black-yellow-red roundel. The flag of Tuvalu and that of Fiji are also defaced sky blue ensigns.

The white ensign of the commissioner of the Northern Lighthouse Board is unique in that it remains one of the only examples of a pre-1801 Union Flag in official use today. This flag is flown only from vessels with commissioners aboard.

There are two &quot;yellow&quot; ensigns in use in the South Pacific, both featuring the Southern Cross. The personal flag of the governor of Victoria, Australia, has been the flag of Victoria with a yellow instead of a dark blue background. The flag of Niue, a self-governing dependency of New Zealand, is also a &quot;yellow&quot; ensign. More unusually, it is the Union Flag canton rather than the fly which is defaced with a modified Southern Cross.

There is some evidence of the existence of a Green Ensign in British Ireland, defaced with a gold Irish harp in the fly. It is not clear to what extent this unofficial ensign was ever in use by Irish merchant ships at the time.

The flag of the British Antarctic Territory has a white field defaced with the territory&#x27;s badge, while the British Indian Ocean Territory flag has a white and blue wavy-striped field, also defaced.

Finally, there is one &quot;orange&quot; ensign, used by the Orange Order in Canada. This flag is an orange ensign defaced with a white shield, and a red maple leaf within it.

=== Cornish Ensign ===

The Cornish Ensign or St Piran&#x27;s Ensign, is a Cornish flag with the Union flag in the canton. This flag is used widely among Cornish mariners. Often flown by leisure craft and occasionally flown by Cornish merchant vessels.

=== Devon Ensign ===

First flown in 2003 the Devon Regatta Ensign adds a Union flag into the canton of the Devon Flag – the flag is described as for use at regattas, high days and holidays, weddings and burials at sea. 

This flag can also be referred to as the St Petroc&#x27;s Ensign, due to its link with the saint. This flag is widely used among Devonian mariners. Often flown by leisure craft.

== Colours ==
The colours used in most British ensigns are the colours of the Union Flag; Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white:

All HEX, CMYK and RGB specifications for the Pantone colours are taken from the official Pantone website on the webpages of the corresponding colours. Although the colour schemes are official, not all of the colours are completely congruent. This is due to different specifications for different types of media (for example, screen and print).

==The Royal Hospital School==
The Royal Hospital School is the only independent school in the United Kingdom to have been continuously awarded the &quot;Queens Banner&quot; and its own distinctive school ensign.

==History==

Prior to 1864, red, white, and blue were the colours of the three squadrons of the Royal Navy, which were created as a result of the reorganisation of the navy in 1652 by Admiral Robert Blake. Each squadron flew one of the three ensigns. In addition to the Admiral of the Fleet (who was Admiral of the Red), each squadron had its own admirals, vice admirals and rear admirals, e.g. Lord Nelson was Vice Admiral of the White at the time of his death.

The red squadron tended to patrol the Caribbean and north Atlantic, the white the coasts of Britain, France and the Mediterranean, while the blue patrolled the south Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The flags of the various former British colonies often have grounds of the same colour as their protective squadron. Hence Bermuda has a red ground and Australia and New Zealand blue. Canada&#x27;s flag was a red ensign from founding until the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965.

The flag of the United States also follows this pattern; early flags of the American Revolution were modified Red Ensigns. The Grand Union Flag added six white stripes to the Red Ensign; this flag was used during the fight for independence until the Union Flag in the canton was replaced by the stars in 1777.

Reference was sometimes made to &quot;the yellow squadron&quot;. This squadron did not actually exist but was a term used unofficially to describe those naval personnel who worked ashore or did not have a ship. Therefore, there was no &#x27;Yellow ensign&#x27;.

==Canadian ensigns==
In 1868, the British Admiralty made the Canadian Blue Ensign the proper flag for ships of the Canadian government, and in 1892, the Admiralty approved the use of the Canadian Red Ensign by Canadian merchant ships.

From about 1870, Canada unofficially used a Red Ensign with the arms of its provinces on one shield as its national flag (the Canadian Red Ensign). In 1924, an order-in-council made the flag official (for certain purposes) and replaced the provincial arms with the royal arms of Canada. The red ensign was replaced by the current red and white maple-leaf flag in 1965. In that same year, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba adopted red ensigns defaced by their provincial arms as their provincial flags. (see Flag of Ontario and Flag of Manitoba)

<text>A free party is a party &quot;free&quot; from the restrictions of the legal club scene, similar to the free festival movement. It typically involves a sound system playing electronic dance music from late at night until the time when the organisers decide to go home. A free party can be composed of just one system or of many and if the party becomes a festival, it becomes a teknival. The word &quot;free&quot; in this context is used both to describe the entry fee and the lack of restrictions and law enforcement.

Motivations for organisers range from political protest to simply wanting to have fun. An example of free parties as political protest was their prominence during the M11 link road protest. At most parties no money is asked for entrance since the aim is not to make profit. However, at some (most often indoor) events it is requested at the door to make a donation to cover costs. Typically organisers make little profit or make a loss setting them up. The term free party is used more widely in Europe than in the US. In Canada and some parts of Europe they are also referred to as Freetekno parties. A free party might have once been described as a rave, and the origins of the two are similar. Since the birth of nightclubs in town centres in Europe the use of the word &quot;rave&quot; had largely fallen out of fashion; however, in recent times it is increasingly being used again.

The term squat party defines the free parties with secret indoor locations. The address is obtained on the day of the event personally from organizers as the buildings are squatted. The parties often last over 24 hours.

==History==
After the emergence of the Acid House parties in the late 1980s up to 4,000 people were known to attend a rave. These events happened almost every weekend. The noise and disturbance of thousands of people appearing at parties in rural locations, such as Genesis &#x27;88, caused outrage in the national media. The British government made the fine for holding an illegal party £20,000 and six months in prison.

Police crackdowns on these often-illegal parties drove the scene into the countryside. These weekend parties occurred at various locations outside the M25 Orbital motorway and attracted up to 25 000. Sound systems from this time include Spiral Tribe and DiY.

In August and September 1990 a series of unlicensed free parties took place on Pepperbox Hill, just outside Salisbury, in South Wiltshire. The parties were organised by a loose collective of new age travellers, squatters and anarchists based in the Salisbury area. They used different pseudonyms, including Inner Temple, The Fools On The Hill and The Leyline Lunatics, but ultimately became known as the People From Pepperbox or PFP. Initially small scale affairs, the parties grew in size during August as word spread to clubbers in Bournemouth and Southampton. By the end of August, people were attending from across the UK. The final party on Pepperbox Hill was held on 1 September 1990. with Wiltshire Constabulary closing the site off from public access the following weekend. The People From Pepperbox then went on to organise three subsequent events in 1990, at Barton Stacey airfield in Hampshire, a disused RAF airbase at Sopley in Dorset, and at a squatted former pub in Salisbury, deploying guerilla tactics to stay ahead of the police and ensure the parties remained undetected until they were too large to be stopped by the authorities. On 13 April 1991 one further PFP party was held at a new age travellers&#x27; site at Pitton, near Salisbury. The party ended in violence, and led to parliamentary debate discussing new age traveller sites. The Pepperbox free parties are regarded as being the first of their kind, as they represented the first time that the concepts of raves and free festivals combined to create a new cultural entity: the free party. DJs at these pioneering events included Pepperbox organisers DJ Oli and DJ ETC, Bournemouth DJs Justin Harris and Nigel Casey (known as North and South), and latterly, Simon DK and DJ Jack from Nottingham&#x27;s DiY soundsystem.

In the 1990s legal raves began to expand into a global phenomenon. Around 1989-1992 people who had travelled to attend the first raves began setting up promotion companies in each region to organize their own parties. This happened on a grassroots basis. By the mid-1990s, major corporations were sponsoring events and adopting the scene&#x27;s music and fashion for their advertising.

After sensational coverage in the tabloids, culminating in a particularly large rave (near Castlemorton) in May 1992, the government acted on what was depicted as a growing menace. In 1994, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Criminal Justice Bill passed as the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which contained several sections designed to suppress the growing free party and anti-road protest movements (sometimes embodied by ravers and travellers). This led to the expansion of the movement mainly due to the collective named Spiral Tribe, who fled the UK after the Castlemorton rave. Fleeing the numerous fines they were facing from the English government, they went to France, where they organized the first major festival outside the United Kingdom : Frenchtek, which is still held illegally every year.

By the early 2000s, the term &quot;rave&quot; had fallen out of favour among some people in the electronic dance music community, particularly in Europe. Although the terme &quot;rave&quot; is still used quite a bit in North America to describe EDM events. The Freetekno movement is not nearly as present in North America, except some parts of Quebec. Many Europeans identify themselves as &quot;clubbers&quot; rather than ravers. The term &#x27;free party&#x27; has been used for sometime and can be seen on the Spiral Tribe video &#x27;Forward the Revolution&#x27; in 1992. It tried to disconnect raves from big commercial events of the early nineties to a more anarchist version of a party.

Some communities preferred the term &quot;festival&quot;, while others simply referred to &quot;parties&quot;. With less constrictive laws allowing raves to continue long after the United Kingdom tried to ban them, more anarchic raves continue to occur in Central Europe and France, where the law says there can be only 4 teknivals per year (2 in the south, 2 in the north). In France the larger teknivals can attract up to 30 000 people in a three-day period. The terms free party and squat party have become the predominant terms used to describe an illegal party.

Free parties tend to be on the boundaries of law and are discouraged by government authorities, occasionally using aggressive police tactics.

Liza &#x27;N&#x27; Eliaz was considered a &quot;spiritual leader&quot; in the free party movement in France.

==Typical party==

Free parties are much like other rave parties, their main distinction being that people are free to express themselves and for events without restrictions, some times they are free of charge. These events are often held in isolated outdoor venues or abandoned buildings. Away from authorities attention and also to avoid public disturbance.

Often free parties and squat parties involve a lot of (mostly illegal) dance drug use. The music played at free parties is very bass heavy. It is for this reason that they are usually held in isolated venues or places where police interference is unlikely, such as protected squatting residences (particularly in the UK, where police used not to be able to enter a squat easily).

The types of music played are usually various forms of dance music with fast repetitive beats. Each sound system has its own music policy, following and entourage. The breakcore, gabba, psy-trance, freetekno, Acid Tekno, Hard Trance and Electro House/Techno, Drum &amp; Bass/Jungle, Hardtek, Tribe, Tribecore, Tekstep genres are all played. It is important to differentiate the techno played in clubs and that is nowadays mainstream, from the tekno with a ´´K´´played in freeparties. Some parties in England, but also across Europe such as in the Netherlands, now incorporate elements of performance art (&quot;synthetic circus&quot;) as well as electronic dance music.

Due to the lack of licensing restrictions, these parties often start after midnight and continue through the night until morning, often longer. Parties lasting several days are not uncommon; some large teknivals can go on for a week.

Squat parties have an overt or implied radical left-wing stance. The squat party community embraces autonomous, anarchistic principles by refusing to recognize the right of any third-party authority to decide when and how people should congregate. Squat party organizers also eschew capitalistic values by putting on parties which benefit the community and its artists instead of to turn a profit.

Occasionally, squat parties act as ad-hoc information points where political pamphlets are distributed or petitions signed in order to raise awareness about a variety of causes, usually of a left-wing nature. London&#x27;s Reclaim the Streets movement, which brought traffic and commerce to a standstill once a year in an attempt to draw public attention to inner city problems, was itself a highly visible and politicized affiliate of the U.K. squat party scene.

Squat parties are events held in squatted venues/occupied properties usually without restrictions allowing people to express themselves freely, just like a free party with the difference that a squat parties are held in unused/abandoned buildings mostly happening in the winter and autumn, when its mostly cold to hold parties outdoors.

==Law and police==
===UK===

Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 the definition of music played at a rave was given as:

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air during any period of time, day or night when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000). The Act was ostensibly introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. It has also been claimed that it was introduced to kill a popular youth movement that was taking many drinkers out of town centres drinking taxable alcohol and into fields to take untaxed drugs.

The number of people attending and organising such an event for it to be deemed illegal were altered in the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 section 58 to cover indoor parties and outdoor parties of more than 20 people. It is also a crime if, within 24 hours of being told by a police officer to leave a rave, a person makes preparations to attend a rave.

More recently in the United Kingdom, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been used against unlicensed rave organisers if the police receive repeated complaints about noise and littering from locals.

Despite these laws, free parties continue to exist. They do so in a number of ways. They can be small (with fewer than 100 people) and remote so that they are unlikely to cause distress to the local residents. If the police find out about the party and turn up, it is rarely worth the use of resources to attempt to arrest people and seize equipment. The people at the rave would then have to leave without having time to tidy up and potentially still incapable of driving safely. The other way free parties continue is to be large enough to make breaking them up difficult. When there are more than 500 or so people then there is a potential for a riot.
A typical police response to why a rave was not stopped is:
&quot;officers had decided not to stop the rave because they had only received one complaint about noise and the amount of resources needed to stop it would not be justified.&quot;

In August 2006, an unlicensed party organised by united sounds – Aztek, LowKey, One Love, Mission, Illicit, Monolith &amp; Brains-Kan Sound Systems in Essex, England was broken up after 24 hours resulting in approx 60 injuries from both sides and over 50 arrests. This was one of the largest confrontations between police and ravers that had occurred at an unlicensed event for many years. The Chief Superintendent in charge of the police operation said &quot;These sorts of raves are quite unheard of in this county - I have not seen this sort of violence since the old days of acid house.&quot;

==Squat party==

A squat party is a party that takes place either in a disused building (broken into and secured for the party) or in an already existing squat/occupied building.

Squat parties are usually advertised either by word of mouth, postings on internet bulletin boards, whatsapp, telegram, flyers handed out at other similar events and through phone lines set up by organizers or the sound system(s) planning the event. This is for security reasons, since the organizers do not want the authorities finding out about them and trying to stop them. Other events might be much smaller acoustic nights run more like a cafe. Squatted buildings are often used as social centres and creative spaces for people to use.

Most squat parties usually run for 12 to 24 hours, finishing when the organizers have had enough or if they are shut down by police. Most large cities in the UK have a squat party scene with London considered the most active location in the country. The majority of London squat parties occur in mainly industrial states in disused warehouses which make ideal venues and a smaller chance of residential noise complaints. The London squat party scene of recent years has seen an influx of foreigners and usually becoming events with attendees from all around the planet. Its a very unique experience that you don&#x27;t find in licensed venues, but as they are secret events, then it can be tricky to find them out. Usually regular attendees bring news attendees, and the word spread out. 

Squat parties has grown in recent decades after London night clubs start closing down in a fast rate. Since 2007, new laws and restrictions imposed by the council and government has created a crisis in London night life forcing many club closing its doors. which has increased interest by people on squat party scene which allows them to party and express themselves freely and dance for longer hours without hassle or securities watching over your shoulders.

These events has often police presence, usually they come around to check on event and people&#x27;s safety. Despite most of free parties are unlicensed, often they are allowed to go on the basis that people are safe because closing down illegal events can cause great chaos, putting people in danger, drunk party goers and general public, but they will usually close the event if they understand that people are in danger.

Squat &#x27;eviction&#x27; parties occur when the squatters residing in a building have been given a final date for their eviction, and as a final act of resistance organize a large scale party and protest in order to try to withstand the police or bailiffs.

==Drugs==

Drugs sale and use is long standing and accepted, most commonly MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, nitrous oxide, and ketamine. Drugs are easily available at almost all free parties and people often use stimulants to reduce the fatigue resulting from dancing for many hours, as well as for the recreational effects. While psychedelics are often used to achieve altered states of consciousness, especially in psy trance festivals.

In early years MDMA was the most common drug taken at parties; however, over the last ten years there has been a steady increase in the popularity of ketamine in Europe, most noticeably in the London scene, where ketamine has a massive presence.

In many free-parties, the organisers will have some sort of risk-reduction in place. Often offering earplugs, nose and eye drops, condoms and paper straws for sniffing. They will do this knowing that people will consume drugs anyways, so they decide to prevent issues like Hepatitis or deafness. In some cases they will also have a tent to tend to people in need, who have either consumed too many drugs or are tired from dancing for extended periods of time. Since 2000 ketamine has crossed over from being almost entirely a drug found in the free party scene to one commonly found in mainstream clubs as well.

==Security==

Due to the drug culture and unregulated environment, security has become a problem for many party organisers. Some free party sound systems hire private security at events to keep the crowd safe, but they are not always present.

Parties become autonomous zones, with self-policing and control being established by all attendance. If people make trouble calling the police is not an option so sometimes the music is stopped and the trouble makers are simply told by all the party goers to leave.

==Locations==

Typical parties in the London scene range from small parties with a couple of hundred people up to huge multi-riggers involving a thousand or more people. The number of sound systems involved also varies – small parties may have just one or two sound systems, larger parties may have anything up to 20 or more, including several &quot;link-ups&quot; where two or more sound systems will combine their rigs into a single large system.

Although London is the central location for squat parties, they exist outside the capital and places such as Three Counties Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire &amp; Cambridgeshire also Buckinghamshire have popular scenes dating pre 1995. Modern parties are usually hosted in Bedford, Norfolk, or London; but Cambridgeshire, Northampton and Suffolk still have a contemporary underground scene, along with Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and South Wales. Outdoor parties are popular all over Wales and the South West and can attract up to a thousand people. Outdoor parties are organised so that noise pollution is not a factor. If the local residents complain then the party is much more at risk of being stopped. In most big cities there is an underground counterculture centred around free parties which are predominantly outdoor parties in the summer and squat parties when it is too cold. Most organisers will try to secure a warehouse, if not they will look for a wooded area to hide themselves and try and soften the music and enjoy the outdoor environment also to avoid being discovered by the authorities.

<text>Derrick Leon Green (born January 20, 1971) is an American musician best known as the vocalist of Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura. He joined the band in 1997 after the departure of band founder Max Cavalera.

==Early life==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Green is the youngest of three children; his sister Renée Green is an artist, writer, and filmmaker. Green&#x27;s father, Friendly, an electrician, and mother, Gloria, a music teacher, moved the family from inner-city Cleveland to surbuban Shaker Heights when Green was 7. &quot;This was my first live interaction with white people,&quot; Green later recalled. From an early age, Green wished to travel and live outside the United States; he went to Berlin for a time before moving from New York to São Paulo.

==Career==

===Pre-Sepultura===
Green became a friend and roadie of the already formed thrash metal/hardcore band Outface which was formed in 1985. He then joined the band in 1986 at the age of 15 after the departure of their two former singers. The band consisted of guitarist Charlie Garriga (CIV), bassist Frank Cavanagh (Prong and Filter) and drummer Mark Konopka. They recorded two demos, one in 1987 and the other in 1989. They were then offered a recording deal by a friend from New York, Walter Schreifels (Quicksand, Youth of Today, Gorilla Biscuits) for a recording deal to record for his new sub label of Crisis Records for one studio album, &quot;Friendly Green&quot; (named after Green&#x27;s father), released in 1992. Stylistically, their music varied between rock, heavy metal and punk with ska elements. Green was credited as Simon Verde on the Outface release (&quot;Green&quot; is translated as &quot;Verde&quot; in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian). With this lineup they toured and played in many places on the east coast and the south of the United States and one tour in Europe.

Once back from the tour in Europe, Green and Garriga decided that they wanted to move to New York City. Cavanagh stayed and later went on to join the band Filter. Konopka also decided to stay and recorded one album with the band Integrity.

In New York, Green and Garriga teamed up with drummer Sammy Siegler (Side by Side, Youth of Today, Judge), bass player Eric Thrice (Orange 9mm), who was replaced by Sara Cox, to form Overfiend. The band was named after the brutal Japanese animated film &quot;Legend of the Overfiend&quot;. They recorded a three-song demo with the help of Schreifels, the direction was much heavier with influences of metal and heavy rock. Their first show was played in Staten Island opening for Sick of It All. This would be their only show. Garriga and Siegler would leave the band to join and form CIV.

In 1996, Green would start to play guitar and sing with Sara Cox, they would then form the band Alpha Jerk. They later recruited drummer Luke Abby (Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits), who was then replaced by Nick Heller (Sweet Diesel). They would release one self-titled album on Toybox Records. They managed to play a few shows in the New York area and doing a few shows together with the bands Lunachicks and Demonspeed. Two songs were featured on &quot;New York&#x27;s Hardest, Vol. 2&quot; compilation.

===Sepultura===

Green was approached in 1997 by A&amp;R rep Mike Gitter from Roadrunner Records. He told him that Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera had left the band in 1996 and they were searching for a new vocalist. He suggested Green try out for the position. Sepultura had recorded one song with no vocals to see what people all around the world could come up with. Green got a hold of the tape from Gitter and he recorded his idea for the song &quot;Choke&quot; and sent it to Brazil. A month later he received a phone call from Sepultura&#x27;s drummer, Igor Cavalera. He was then asked to fly down to São Paulo, Brazil to meet everyone and audition for the position. Green flew out a week later and met everyone and auditioned for two weeks. Green was asked to come back to Brazil to start recording his first album, &quot;Against&quot;, with Sepultura.

Most of &quot;Against&quot; was written before Green entered the band. &quot;Against&quot; was released in 1998 and the group set out on a world tour. Green moved from New York and decided to live in Amsterdam while on a promo tour. The album was critically and commercially less successful than previous Sepultura albums, as many fans were still coming to terms with the absence of Max Cavalera from the band. AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, and gave an optimistic note of the band&#x27;s future by stating that &quot;there are enough flashes of the old Sepultura brilliance to suggest that great things are still to come&quot;.

&quot;Nation&quot; would be the first album that Green would take part in the writing process for, from beginning to end. He decided to move to São Paulo to be closer to the group and work on the new material. &quot;Nation&quot;, the band&#x27;s eighth album with Roadrunner Records, was released in 2001 and sold poorly. Allmusic.com gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he&#x27;s singing about more than just &#x27;one tribe, Sepulnation&#x27;; he&#x27;s suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for&quot;. In an interview, Derrick said about the album that &quot;every song will be related to the idea of building this idea of a positive nation. We will have our own flag, our own anthem, our own army&quot;.

&quot;Nation&quot; was the group&#x27;s last studio album with Roadrunner Records, as their contract ran out. The contract had an option for one more album but the group felt the label was not supportive enough. A recording of Max Cavalera&#x27;s last live show with Sepultura, titled &quot;Under a Pale Grey Sky&quot;, was released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records, against the wishes of the band.

&quot;Revolusongs&quot;, an EP of cover songs was released by the band. The EP was exclusively released in Brazil and Japan, but then the band was picked up by record label SPV and Revolusongs was later included as a bonus disc on the digipak edition of &quot;Roorback&quot;, the next full-length studio album with Green. A collaboration between the video director Ricardo Della Rosa and Green created the idea of the music video of U2&#x27;s song &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;. It won best photography in the 2003 Brazil MTV music awards show.

Despite &quot;Roorback&quot; receiving critical acclaim, sales remained low. Allmusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003&#x27;s excellent Roorback should put them to rest for good. Green is passionate and focused throughout the album —he has no problem going that extra mile— and the writing is consistently strong&quot;.

All the tracks on the DVD &quot;Live in São Paulo&quot; were recorded on April 3, 2005, at a concert in São Paulo, Brazil. A CD of the same name was also recorded. Both were released on November 8, 2005, through SPV Records. The second DVD features a documentary of the band&#x27;s career from 1998 on, filmed and co-edited by Green.

&quot;Dante XXI&quot; was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, a book that Green read in high school and suggested to the band for the concept for the album. In &quot;Convicted in Life&quot; video, Green collaborated with the video director Luis Carone for the idea. The video won for best editing in a video and best direction in a video at the Brazil MTV music awards show in 2006.

Allmusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, &quot;Overall, &quot;Dante XXI&quot; is easily one of Sepultura&#x27;s strongest releases to feature Green on vocals&quot;. Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of &quot;Dante XXI&quot;. He was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella who they continued with and toured with for the most part of the &quot;Dante XXI&quot; tour.

Sepultura released the album &quot;A-Lex&quot; on January 26, 2009. &quot;A-Lex&quot; is a concept album based on Anthony Burgess&#x27; book &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Allmusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said that &quot;personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years – and that vitality is alive and well on the superb &quot;A-Lex&quot;&quot;.

On July 6, 2010, it was announced that Sepultura have signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records, and will release their first album &quot;Kairos&quot; for the label in 2011. Roy Z (Judas Priest, Halford, Iron Maiden&#x27;s Bruce Dickinson, Helloween) was the producer for the new album.

===Musica Diablo===
Green joined another band, Musica Diablo, in 2008, a thrash metal band with members of Nitrominds, Ação Direta and Dead Fish. On May 28, 2010, the band released their self-titled debut album on both CD and MP3 download. CD Universe said that &quot;Musica Diablo&#x27;s extreme fast thrash metal, with the characteristic Brazilian style and a strong root into the 1980s veterans made them unique, and the need of recording a proper album was eminent. The band recorded their first album in January 2010 with the well known producer Rafael Ramos in Rio de Janeiro. A month later, Derrick Green recorded his vocals in São Paulo, again under Rafael&#x27;s production. The result is a killer, blast-in-your-face album with 11 songs of sheer violence and pure Brazilian Thrash Metal!&quot;. Green has since left Musica Diablo.

===Collaborations===
Green was a guest vocalist on a few CDs including Biohazard&#x27;s &quot;Uncivilization&quot; and the soundtrack of the Brazilian movie &quot;Lisbela e o Prisioneiro&quot;.

Green appeared with Sepultura in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that &quot;it&#x27;s the first time you&#x27;ve seen Sepultura like this. And a sedan like this one too&quot;. This Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, the opposite of its Heavy Metal style, to say that &quot;you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage&quot;.

Green is working on a three volume book set of his photography and writings due to be released in late 2011/2012. Each volume will be released at different times.

In 2013, Green worked on a side project called Maximum Hedrum.

== Personal life ==
In 2011, when asked about his religious views, Green replied:

Green speaks fluent Portuguese with a noticeable American accent. He previously lived in Carapicuíba, São Paulo, but now lives in Los Angeles.

Green is a vegan. He has been a vegetarian since 1986. He made this publicly clear in a PETA video interview regarding Sepultura&#x27;s 2006 video of the song &quot;Convicted in Life&quot;. He stated in the interview that the subject of this video is that some kind of &quot;karma&quot; is inflicted on those that damage the environment and its wildlife.

<text>An interstellar ark is a conceptual starship designed for interstellar travel. Interstellar arks may be the most economically feasible method of traveling such distances. The ark has also been proposed as a potential habitat to preserve civilization and knowledge in the event of a global catastrophe.

Such a ship would have to be large, requiring a large power plant. The Project Orion concept of propulsion by nuclear pulses has been proposed. The largest spacecraft design analyzed in Project Orion had a diameter and weighed approximately 8 million tons. It could be large enough to host a city of 100,000 or more people.

== Thrust concepts ==
Another concern is selection of power sources and mechanisms which would remain viable for the long time spans involved in interstellar travel through the desert of space. The longest-lived space probes are the Voyager program probes, which use radioisotope thermoelectric generators having a useful lifespan of a mere 50 years.

One propulsion method for a crewed spacecraft could be a fusion microexplosion nuclear pulse propulsion system (like that proposed in Project Daedalus) that may allow it to obtain an interstellar cruising velocity of up to 10% of the speed of light. However, if the ship is capable of transits requiring hundreds of thousands of years, chemical and gravitational slingshot propulsion may be sufficient.

== Specific proposals and research projects ==
The Enzmann starship proposed in 1964 is a large fusion-powered spacecraft that could function as an interstellar ark, supporting a crew of 200 with extra space for expansion, on multi-year journeys at subluminal speeds to nearby star systems.

In 1955 Project Orion considered nuclear propulsion for spacecraft, suitable for deep space voyages.

In 1973–1978 Project Daedalus was conducted by the British Interplanetary Society to study uncrewed interstellar spacecraft.

<doc id="244072" wikidata="Q708520" url="?curid=244072" title="Arthur Laffer">
<text>Arthur Betz Laffer (; born August 14, 1940) is an American economist and author who first gained prominence during the Reagan administration as a member of Reagan&#x27;s Economic Policy Advisory Board (1981–1989). Laffer is best known for the Laffer curve, an illustration of the theory that there exists some tax rate between 0% and 100% that will result in maximum tax revenue for government. In certain circumstances, this would allow governments to cut taxes, and simultaneously increase revenue and economic growth.

Laffer was an economic advisor to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. In 2019, President Trump awarded Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions in the field of economics.

==Early life and education==

Laffer was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Marian Amelia &quot;Molly&quot; (née Betz), a homemaker and politician, and William Gillespie Laffer, president of the Clevite Corporation. He was raised in the Cleveland, Ohio area. He is a Presbyterian, and was graduated from Cleveland&#x27;s University School high school in 1958. Laffer earned a B.A. in economics from Yale University (1963) and an M.B.A. (1965) and a Ph.D. in economics (1972) from Stanford University.

== Academia ==

Laffer was an Associate Professor of Business Economics at the University of Chicago from 1970 to 1976 and a member of the Chicago faculty from 1967 through 1976. From 1976 to 1984 Laffer held the status as the Charles B. Thornton Professor of Business Economics at the University of Southern California School of Business. During this time Laffer helped pass Proposition 13, the California initiative that drastically cut property taxes in the state in 1978. In the mid-1980s, Laffer was the Distinguished University Professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, and a member of the Pepperdine University Board of Directors.

== Politics ==

Laffer was the first to hold the title of Chief Economist at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under George Shultz from October 1970 to July 1972. During the years 1972 to 1977, Laffer was a consultant to Secretary of the Treasury William Simon, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz.

Laffer was a member of President Reagan&#x27;s Economic Policy Advisory Board for both of his terms (1981–1989) and was a founding member of the Reagan Executive Advisory Committee for the presidential race of 1980. Laffer served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Reagan/Bush Finance Committee in 1984.

In 1986, Laffer was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate—which he lost in the California primary to U.S. Congressman Ed Zschau, who lost in the general election to the incumbent, Democrat Alan Cranston. Laffer identifies himself as a staunch fiscal conservative. However, he has stated publicly that he voted for President Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Laffer references President Clinton&#x27;s conservative fiscal and unregulated market policies as cornerstones of his support.

In 2018, Laffer wrote the book &quot;Trumponomics&quot; with conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore, wherein they lauded the Trump administration&#x27;s economic policies. In the book, Moore and Laffer argue that the Trump administration&#x27;s 2017 tax plan would raise growth rates to as much as 6% and not increase budget deficits. In a 2019 review of the book, Greg Mankiw, a conservative economics professor at Harvard University, characterized Laffer and Moore as &quot;rah-rah partisans&quot; who &quot;do not build their analysis on the foundation of professional consensus or serious studies from peer-reviewed journals...The Laffer curve is undeniable as a matter of economic theory. There is certainly some level of taxation at which cutting tax rates would be win-win. But few economists believe that tax rates in the United States have reached such heights in recent years; to the contrary, they are likely below the revenue-maximizing level.&quot; The one issue where Moore and Laffer disagree with Trump is on the issue of free trade, which the duo supports. Previously, in 2016, Laffer said that he believed that then-candidate Trump was &quot;going to be okay on trade&quot; and lauded Trump&#x27;s understanding of trade.

Laffer regularly writes opinion articles in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

On April 15, 2019, Laffer blamed the Great Recession on Barack Obama, &quot;who I believe was the reason why we had the Great Recession. As he got closer and closer to winning the markets collapsed.&quot;

In 2020, Laffer advised the Trump administration on how to re-open the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Laffer argued for halting stimulus, calling instead for payroll tax cuts. He advocated for taxes on non-profit organizations in education and the arts, as well as for salary reductions for professors and government officials. He argued against expansion of unemployment aid, arguing it discouraged people from working.

=== Presidential Medal of Freedom ===
In 2019, President Trump awarded Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. The Trump White House said Laffer was receiving the award for &quot;public service and contributions to economic policy that have helped spur prosperity for our Nation&quot; and that Laffer was &quot;one of the most influential economists in American history&quot; due to popularizing the &quot;Laffer Curve.&quot; Trump praised Laffer for policies that he said brought &quot;greater opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

==Laffer curve==
Although Laffer does not claim to have invented the Laffer curve concept, it was popularized with policymakers following an afternoon meeting Laffer had with Nixon/Ford Administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument. The term &quot;Laffer curve&quot; was coined by Jude Wanniski, who was also present. The basic concept was not new; Laffer himself says he learned it from Ibn Khaldun and John Maynard Keynes.

The Laffer curve is an economic theory that shows the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments. The Laffer Curve shows that there is a certain point between 0% and 100% where tax revenues are maximized. The curve suggests that starting from zero, an increase in tax rates will increase the government&#x27;s tax revenue; after a certain point, however, continuing to increase tax rates will cause a decrease in tax revenue. This decrease in tax revenue can be explained by decreased incentives for work, production, etc. Laffer&#x27;s postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed: so low that current tax rates were above the level where revenue is maximized. While many economists believe that government spending to stimulate demand for products should be the solution for a poorly performing economy, Laffer argues that heavy taxes and regulation impede production, and therefore, government revenue.

Numerous leading economists have rejected the view that a tax rate cut of current federal U.S. income taxes can lead to increased tax revenue. When asked in a 2012 University of Chicago business school survey whether a &quot;cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut&quot;, none of the economists surveyed agreed and 71% disagreed. According to Greg Mankiw, most economists have been very skeptical of Laffer&#x27;s contention that decreases in tax rates could increase tax revenue, at least in the United States. In his textbook, Mankiw states, &quot;there was little evidence for Laffer&#x27;s view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels.&quot; Under the direction of conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a 2005 study on the fiscal effects of a 10% cut in federal income tax rates, finding that it resulted in a significant net revenue loss. Economist John Quiggin distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer&#x27;s analysis of tax rates, writing that the Laffer curve was &quot;correct but unoriginal&quot; and that Laffer&#x27;s analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve &quot;was original but incorrect.&quot;

Laffer was an economic adviser to Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, who in 2012 zeroed out state tax liability for approximately 330,000 of the top wage earners in the state, called the Kansas experiment, contending it would be a &quot;shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.&quot; Laffer was paid $75,000 to advise in the creation of Brownback&#x27;s tax cut plan, and gave Brownback his full endorsement, stating that what Brownback was doing was &quot;truly revolutionary&quot; and would bring &quot;enormous prosperity&quot; to Kansas. The state, which had previously had a budget surplus, experienced a budget deficit of about $200 million in 2012. Drastic cuts to state funding for education and infrastructure were implemented to close budget deficits and the Kansas economy underperformed relative to neighboring states. Brownback&#x27;s tax overhaul was described in a June 2017 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as the United States&#x27; &quot;most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy&quot;. The drastic tax cuts had &quot;threatened the viability of schools and infrastructure&quot; in Kansas. A supermajority of lawmakers in the Kansas legislature, both Democrats and Republicans, repealed the tax cut in June 2017, overriding Brownback&#x27;s veto.

<text>SPK were an Australian industrial rock and noise rock group formed in 1978. They were fronted by mainstay member, Graeme Revell on keyboards and percussion. In 1980 the group travelled to the United Kingdom where they issued their debut album, &quot;Information Overload Unit&quot;. In 1983 Sinan Leong joined on lead vocals. The group disbanded in 1988. Two years later Revell and Leong relocated to the United States, where Revell works as a Hollywood film score composer. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, SPK were &quot;at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes&quot;.

==History==
SPK was formed in 1978 in Sydney when New Zealand-born Graeme Revell (a.k.a. &quot;EMS AKS&quot;, &quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;Oblivion&quot;) met Neil Hill (a.k.a. &quot;Ne/H/il&quot;). Revell was working as a nurse on a psychiatric ward at Callan Park Hospital where Hill was also working. Hill and Revell shared a house and an interest in the manifesto of the German radical Marxist group known as the Sozialistisches Patientenkollektiv (SPK). The duo were influenced by Kraftwerk, Can, Neu!, Faust, and John Cage – they started playing their own variety of industrial music as SPK. According to rock music historian Ian McFarlane the acronym SPK is variously given as &quot;SoliPsiK, SepPuKu, Surgical Penis Klinik, System Planning Korporation and Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv&quot;. The band recruited two teenagers, Danny Rumour (later of The Cruel Sea) on lead guitar and David Virgin on bass guitar (both ex-Ugly Mirrors, and went on to form Sekret Sekret), on early recordings by SPK in 1979. In that year they independently released three 7&quot; pressings: &quot;SoliPsiK&quot; as a three-track extended play in April, &quot;Factory&quot; as a single in August and &quot;Mekano&quot; in November.

Dominik Guerin (a.k.a. &quot;Tone Generator&quot;) joined on synthesisers in 1980, and later concentrated on the band&#x27;s visual content. In May they issued an EP, &quot;Meat Processing Section&quot;, as Surgical Penis Klinik. Without Hill, SPK relocated to London where Guerin and Revell recorded their debut album, &quot;Information Overload Unit&quot;, in a Vauxhall squat with the help of Revell&#x27;s brother Ashley Revell (a.k.a. &quot;Mr.Clean&quot;) and Mike Wilkins (guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals). The album deals with psychotic states and intellectual disability. The original 1981 release on Side Effects has a black cover with a small picture of head being operated on, the 1985 version on Normal is blue and pictures a man in a wheelchair and the 1992 CD reissue has System Planning Korporation with the initials SPK highlighted in red. McFarlane suggested &quot;the album&#x27;s harsh, thumping sound appealed to fans of Throbbing Gristle and early Cabaret Voltaire&quot;. In June 1980 they issued the single, &quot;Slogun&quot;, with lyrics inspired by the Marxist manifesto: &quot;Kill, Kill, Kill for inner peace / Bomb, Bomb, Bomb for mental health / Therapy through violence!&quot; Other musicians working with SPK included James Pinker (drums, percussion) and Karel van Bergan (violin, vocals), who toured with them to the United States. In July 1981 in Australia, the M Squared label released another single, &quot;See Saw&quot;. The cover depicts SoliPsiK with members given as Kitka (a.k.a. Kit Katalog), Sushi (a.k.a. Margaret Hill), Charlyiev (a.k.a. Paul Charlier) and Skorne (Neil Hill). Both tracks are co-written by Charlier and Hill.

In 1982 SPK&#x27;s Guerin and Revell were joined by Brian Williams (a.k.a. Lustmord), John Murphy (a.k.a. &quot;Kraang&quot;, later of Foresta Di Ferro and Death In June) and Derek Thompson (who later had a brief stint in The Cure and went on to record as Hoodlum Priest). SPK&#x27;s second album, &quot;Leichenschrei&quot; (English: &quot;The Scream of the Corpse&quot;) (1982), shows Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv (English: Socialist Patients&#x27; Collective). After its recording they were joined by Sinan Leong on vocals, who had initially auditioned for a planned SPK side-project, Dance Macabre. Leong and Revell later married. In 1983 Thompson left SPK because Revell &quot;wanted to make a very commercial sounding album which I did not&quot;. McFarlane found that &quot;SPK had softened the approach somewhat with discernible synth melodies and dance beats coming to the fore amongst the noise&quot;. In August 1983, the group issued a compilation album, &quot;Auto Da Fé&quot;, showing SepPuKu written with SPK in red capital letters. It included three studio tracks recorded in 1981. Bush suggested the album was the &quot;beginning of a more organized approach for SPK material, &quot;Auto Da-Fé&quot; presents an intriguing industrial-disco fusion, reminiscent of prime contemporary material by Cabaret Voltaire and DAF ... Although fans probably thought of [it] as an unconscionable crossover attempt, it&#x27;s still quite experimental in retrospect&quot;. The three-track EP, &quot;Dekompositiones&quot; (also by SepPuKu) followed soon after. Its tracks were added to a later version of &quot;Auto Da Fé&quot;.

In early February 1984, just before his 28th birthday, Neil Hill committed suicide. Two days later his wife Margaret Hill (née Nikitenko) died as a result of complications from anorexia. In March SPK issued another single, &quot;Metal Dance&quot;, which was co-written by Revell, Leong and Thompson. SPK returned to Australia for a tour and recorded their third album, &quot;Machine Age Voodoo&quot;, in Sydney which was issued in 1984 on WEA Records. For the album, SPK&#x27;s Revell and Leong were joined by Jeff Bartolomei on keyboards, Mary Bradfield-Taylor on vocals, Graham Jesse on saxophone, James Kelly on guitar, Sam McNally on keyboards and Phil Scorgie on bass guitar. McFarlane saw the album as &quot;mixed mainstream disco-pop and sweet vocals with electronic experimentation (sort of like Blondie meets Kraftwerk)&quot;. While Bush felt it was &quot;another leap towards dance-rock and away from the group&#x27;s industrial past&quot;. The album spawned a single, &quot;Junk Funk&quot; in 1985.

Leong and Revell returned to Australia and added Karina Hayes as vocalist. They issued &quot;Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers&quot; in 1986 which provided a single, &quot;In Flagrante Delicto&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Digitalis Ambigua: Gold &amp; Poison&quot; in 1987. Allmusic&#x27;s Sean Carruthers observed that Revell &quot;was in a period of transition... [s]omewhere between the industrial noise of the early years and his later soundtrack work&quot;. In 1988, the band issued a live album, &quot;Oceania... In Performance 1987&quot; but disbanded during the year. In 1989, Revell moved into work on scores and soundtracks. SPK&#x27;s track &quot;In Flagrante Delicto&quot; was used by Revell for his work on the soundtrack for the 1989 film, &quot;Dead Calm&quot;. By 1991 Leong and Revell had moved to Los Angeles.

McFarlane regarded SPK to be &quot;at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes&quot;.

==Initialism==

The meaning of SPK is deliberately unclear; and some of the album covers suggest several different variations. The most well known is Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv, but there are also others, such as &quot;Surgical Penis Klinik&quot;, &quot;System Planning Korporation&quot;, &quot;SepPuKu&quot;, &quot;Selective Pornography Kontrol&quot;, &quot;Special Programming Korps&quot;, &quot;Sushi Patata Kalabacita&quot; and &quot;SoliPsiK&quot;

==Works==
The most notable recordings of SPK are early: &quot;Information Overload Unit&quot;, &quot;Leichenschrei&quot; and &quot;Auto-da-fé&quot;. SPK&#x27;s music is best described as disturbing and psychologically disorienting, in line with their nihilistic, subversive philosophy. Live performances included video backing (some of which was issued in two &quot;Twin Vison&quot; videos, &quot;Despair&quot; and &quot;Two Autopsy Films&quot;), transgressive performances with animal carcasses and other attempts to make the audience uncomfortable. The group issued manifestos, such as DoKuments 1 and 2, &quot;The Post-Industrial Strategy&quot;, which appeared in RE/Search&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Culture Handbook&quot;. There is a clear dichotomy between early industrial SPK (1978–83) and the more commercial music later favoured by Revell. Later releases, such as &quot;Machine Age Voodoo&quot; (1984), were more synthpop-oriented than industrial. Still later, the group moved into electronic orchestral work, with the release of &quot;Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers&quot; (1986).

<text>A moment of silence (also referred to as a minute&#x27;s silence or a one-minute silence) is a period of silent contemplation, prayer, reflection, or meditation. Similar to flying a flag at half-mast, a moment of silence is often a gesture of respect, particularly in mourning for those who have died recently, or as part of a tragic historical event, such as Remembrance Day.

A minute, or 60 seconds, is a common length of time for the memorialization, though organizers may choose other periods of time, normally connected in some way with the event being commemorated (there might be a minute given for every death commemorated, for example). During a moment of silence, its participants may typically bow their heads, remove their hats, and refrain from speaking, or moving, for the duration of it.

==Origins==

The first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a dead person took place in Portugal on 13 February 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to José Maria da Silva Paranhos Júnior, baron of Rio Branco, Brazil, and Minister of the Exterior of the Brazilian government, who had died three days earlier on 10 February. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate&#x27;s records of that day. In the same year, large parts of the United States kept a ceremonial silence to honour the dead of the &quot;Maine&quot; and the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

The first person to publicly suggest a moment&#x27;s silence as a vessel to hold the sorrow and loss of war was either by South African author and politician James Percy FitzPatrick or by Australian journalist Edward George Honey, himself a World War I veteran. While the Australian government claims Honey was the originator of the idea as it pertained to war remembrance, there are no primary sources to conclusively confirm a date in which Honey&#x27;s proposal predated FitzPatrick&#x27;s. Nevertheless, each person&#x27;s idea was conceived less than a year from each other, so it&#x27;s possible the shared idea was a matter of parallel thinking.

Eric Harding&#x27;s booklet written in support of the monument to Honey erected in 1965 acknowledges that other silences had been held before (upon the death of King Edward, the silences in South Africa &quot;when the war was going badly for the Allies&quot;, ceremonies in Australia for lost miners, in the US when the Maine was sunk, amongst others), but in his words &quot;the originality of Honey&#x27;s suggestion is based on the fact that this was the first time in history that a victory had been celebrated as a tribute to those who sacrificed their lives and their health to make the victory possible&quot;. Harding also acknowledges that, despite extensive research, no evidence of Honey&#x27;s attendance at any rehearsal at Buckingham Palace, nor any record of an official communication mentioning Honey&#x27;s letter having played a part in the adoption of the remembrance tradition, could be found, and that the only &quot;proof&quot; was that the letter preceded the formal approach to the King by several months. However he also writes that &quot;Sir Percy&#x27;s right to recognition for bringing the matter to official notice does not detract in any way from Honey&#x27;s right to recognition as the first to make the suggestion.&quot;

According to an Australian War Memorial article, Honey attended a trial of the event with the Grenadier guards at Buckingham Palace, as did FitzPatrick (although it was not known whether they ever actually met or discussed their ideas). However, Honey&#x27;s wife (whom he called &quot;Millie&quot;), as reported by her friend M.F. Orford&#x27;s 1961 article, states that he &quot;never went out into the streets near the crowds at any time during the observance of the Silence...&quot;, and they only heard about the observance of the first Two Minutes&#x27; Silence when the order was announced by Buckingham Palace.

==Examples==

Many people in the Commonwealth of Nations observe the two-minute silence at 11:00 local time on 11 November each year (Armistice Day) to remember sacrifices of members of the armed forces and of civilians in times of war. In addition, a two minutes of silence is also observed in the United Kingdom on the second Sunday of November which is more recently known as Remembrance Sunday and is televised with a close up image of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and the buglers sounding the Last Post at 11:02UTC.

In Australia and New Zealand, the ceremony was quickly adopted for commemorations held at dawn on ANZAC Day, 25 April. This moment of silence is held to remember the service men and women who died in WWI and subsequent conflicts.

In Israel, moments of silence are held in memory of the victims of the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah and in memory of fallen soldiers and of terrorist victims on the day before Israel&#x27;s independence day.

In Japan, a minute of silence is observed (and televised nationally) at ceremonies every August in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki cities at the same time as the atomic bombings.

Moments of silence are often observed prior to other events including gatherings such as sports matches, with reasons for silences ranging from national and international tragedies or to the death of individuals connected to a group.

In recent years, in the United Kingdom and Israel, the minute&#x27;s silence at sports events has been replaced by a minute of applause.

In Ukraine, a minute of silence is observed every day at 09:00EET to commemorate the victims of Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country. It was officially designated by a presidential decree on 16 March 2023.

In Indonesia, moment of silence is called and is always accompanied with a rendition of a hymn of the same name, composed by Surakarta Sunanate musician . This tradition was said to originate at the behest of Sukarno in the 1958 Heroes&#x27; Day ceremony in Ambon.

==Silent prayer==

Silent prayer as a mode of prayer has antecedents in the Bible, and Jews have been praying silently for thousands of years.

Quakers have practiced silent worship for more than 300 years, believing that all people have the light of God within and that no priestly intercession is needed for the divine to speak. Silent worship in Quaker meetings is seldom entirely silent, and individuals speak as they are moved to by the spirit.

The larger society perhaps adopted the practice of silent prayer in public gatherings because silence contains no statements or assumptions concerning beliefs. Since it requires no understanding of language to interpret, it is more easily accepted and used than a spoken prayer or observance when persons of different religious and cultural backgrounds participate together. Today, the moment of silence is used to avoid offending people with religious pontification and to empower individuals to interpret the moment as they wish.

In the US colonial period, Pennsylvania Quakers did not worship together with non-Quakers, except those who might become converts. They were separatists and did not pray in ecumenical gatherings or in service to institutions.

In recent times the co-opting of Quaker-style silence for non-sectarian and non-controversial public observances has led to its almost universal use in the English-speaking world as well as in other plural societies. This is also the case within many secular institutions where diverse groups are expected to participate but not necessarily share beliefs - such as in government, schools, commercial companies and the military. 

The use of a moment of silence to memorialize fallen soldiers or to allow private reflection in public schools, for example, was not introduced by Quakers themselves.

==In United States schools==

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that official organization, sponsorship, or endorsement of school prayer in public schools is forbidden by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Teachers and school officials may not lead classes in prayer, but prayer is permitted at voluntary religious clubs, and students are not prohibited from praying themselves. Other rulings have forbidden public, organized prayer at school assemblies, sporting events, and similar school-sponsored activities.

Public moments of silence in the United States both arise from and contribute to this debate over prayer and the separation of church and state. A moment of silence lacks any specific religious formulation, and therefore it has been presented as a way of creating reflection and respect without endorsing any particular religion.

President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of a moment of silence in American schools. In 1981, Reagan formally proposed a constitutional amendment permitting organized prayer in public schools. In his 1984 state of the union address, Reagan asked Congress, who begin their day with an invocation: &quot;If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can&#x27;t freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?&quot; Colin Powell, a longtime advocate, has recommended a simple moment of silence at the start of each school day. Further, he states that students could use this interval to pray, meditate, contemplate or study.

However, critics often view the moment of silence as publicly endorsing prayer &quot;in disguise&quot;. This issue has been especially raised by atheist groups and advocates, who argue that no non-religious purpose is served by designating an official moment of silence. Moments of silence point to the tension in the U.S. Constitution and society between accommodation and endorsement. Accommodation of religion is to ensure an environment where a person or student can practice their religion. A question with &quot;moments of silence&quot; laws is whether accommodation was already achieved by the fact that a student can pray or meditate on his/her own without an official moment of silence. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said, on a &quot;moment of silence&quot; case, &quot;Students were already allowed to pray, meditate, or reflect under the statute before it was amended. The addition of the word &#x27;pray&#x27; where it wasn&#x27;t needed clearly shows that legislators intended to promote religion, and that&#x27;s not their job.&quot; Courts have stated on these moments of silence cases that a secular purpose is necessary and according to &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot;, a &quot;statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.&quot;

Although since 1976 the state Virginia law permitted school districts to implement 60 seconds of silence at the start of each school day, in 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an Alabama &quot;moment of silence or voluntary prayer&quot; law was unconstitutional, in the case &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot;. In April 2000, a new law came into being; requiring all Virginian public school students to observe a moment of silence. Also, in 2005, a law was passed in Indiana requiring all public schools to give students a chance to say the Pledge of Allegiance and observe a moment of silence every day. In October 2007, Illinois enacted legislation to require public schools to provide students with a moment of silence at the start of the school day, a statute that was challenged in Illinois state courts. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia also require such moments of quiet in the classroom. In more than 20 other states, teachers are allowed to decide whether they want such a classroom time-out.

In October 2000, the U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the &quot;moment of silence&quot; law was constitutional. Judge Hilton stated, &quot;The court finds that the Commonwealth&#x27;s daily observance of one minute of silence act is constitutional. The act was enacted for a secular purpose, does not advance or inhibit religion, nor is there excessive entanglement with religion... Students may think as they wish – and this thinking can be purely religious in nature or purely secular in nature. All that is required is that they sit silently.&quot; His ruling was upheld in the 4th circuit. Others argued that the law was not enacted for a secular purpose, pointing to statements made by supporters of the legislation. State Senator Charles R. Hawkins (R-Pennsylvania) stated the moment of silence is &quot;a very small measure to address a very large problem.&quot; He also said, &quot;Prayer is not a bad word in my vocabulary.&quot; Kent Willis, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, stated lawmakers are &quot;at the very least placing Virginia law right on the line of separation of church and state or they are crossing it . . . the state is playing with fire here.&quot;

The American Civil Liberties Union was opposed to a proposed constitutional amendment by Newt Gingrich in the early 1990s which would have set aside a voluntary moment of prayer during the school day, which was later independently described by President Bill Clinton as a &quot;moment of silence&quot;.

== Association football ==
When a terrorist attack occurs, association football federations can order minutes of silence for upcoming matches as a gesture of respect for victims who were killed.

In November 2016, LaMia Flight 2933, carrying the Chapecoense football club to the first leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana finals, crashed in Colombia, killing nearly all of its members. Most European football federations ordered a minute of silence following the crash. On the planned date of the final, a memorial was organised by Nacional and Medellín City Council to honor the deceased persons from the crash. About forty five thousand people were present inside the stadium. In January 2019, footballer Emiliano Sala was killed in a plane crash, and minutes of silence were subsequently observed before Premier League, Ligue 1 and European competitions matches.
