<text>The 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida was a period of vote recounting in Florida that occurred during the weeks after Election Day in the 2000 United States presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The Florida vote was ultimately settled in Bush&#x27;s favor by a margin of 537 votes out of 5,825,043 cast when the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, stopped a recount that had been initiated upon a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court. Bush&#x27;s win in Florida gave him a majority of votes in the Electoral College and victory in the presidential election.

==Background==

The controversy began on election night, November 7, 2000, when the national television networks, using information provided to them by the Voter News Service, an organization formed by the Associated Press to help determine the outcome of the election through early result tallies and exit polling, first called Florida for Gore in the hour after polls closed in the peninsula (in the Eastern time zone) but about ten minutes before they closed in the heavily Republican counties of the panhandle (in the Central time zone). Later in the evening, the networks reversed their call, moving to &quot;too close to call&quot;, then later giving it to Bush; then they retracted that call as well, finally indicating the state was &quot;too close to call&quot;. Gore phoned Bush the night of the election to concede, then retracted his concession after learning how close the Florida count was.

Bush led the election-night vote count in Florida by 1,784 votes. The small margin produced an automatic recount under Florida state law, which began the day after the election. That first day&#x27;s results reduced the margin to just over 900 votes. Once it became clear that Florida would decide the presidential election, the nation&#x27;s attention focused on the manual recount.

==Recount==

===Mandatory statewide machine recount===
The Florida election was closely scrutinized after Election Day. Because the margin of the original vote count was less than 0.5 percent, Florida Election Code 102.141 mandated a statewide machine recount, which began the day after the election. It was ostensibly completed on November 10 in the 66 Florida counties that used vote-counting machines and reduced Bush&#x27;s lead to 327 votes. According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but &quot;No one from the Gore campaign ever challenged this view&quot; that the machine recount had been completed.

===Manual recount in select counties===
Once the closeness of the election in Florida was clear, both the Bush and Gore campaigns organized themselves for the ensuing legal process. On November 9, the Bush campaign announced they had hired George H. W. Bush&#x27;s former Secretary of State James Baker and Republican political consultant Roger Stone to oversee their legal team, and the Gore campaign hired Bill Clinton&#x27;s former Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Following the machine recount, the Gore campaign requested a manual recount in four counties. Florida state law at the time allowed a candidate to request a manual recount by protesting the results of at least three precincts. The county canvassing board was then to decide whether to do a recount, as well as the method of the recount, in those three precincts. If the board discovered an error that in its judgment could affect the outcome of the election, they were then authorized to do a full recount of the ballots. This statutory process primarily accommodated recounts for local elections. The Gore campaign requested that disputed ballots in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia Counties be counted by hand. Volusia County started its recount on November 12. Florida statutes also required that all counties certify and report their returns, including any recounts, by 5:00 p.m. on November 14. The manual recounts were time-consuming, and it soon became clear that some counties would not complete their recounts before the deadline. On November 13, the Gore campaign and Volusia and Palm Beach Counties sued to have the deadlines extended.

Meanwhile, the Bush campaign worked to stop the recount. On November 11, it joined a group of Florida voters in suing in federal district court for a preemptive injunction to stop all manual recounting of votes in Florida. Bush&#x27;s lawyers argued that recounting votes in just four counties violated the 14th Amendment and also that similarly punched ballots could be tabulated differently since Florida had no detailed statutory standards for hand-counting votes. On November 13, the federal court ruled against an injunction.

===Reporting deadline===
On November 14, the original deadline for reporting results, with the Volusia County recount complete, Bush held a 300-vote lead. The same day, a state judge upheld that deadline but ruled that further recounts could be considered later. Florida&#x27;s Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, a Republican, then gave counties until 2:00 p.m. on November 15 to provide reasons for recounting their ballots. 

===Manual recount continues===
The next day, the Florida Supreme Court allowed manual recounts in Palm Beach and Broward Counties to continue but left it to a state judge to decide whether Harris must include those votes in the final tally. Miami-Dade County decided on November 17 to conduct a recount but suspended it on November 22. The Gore campaign sued to force Miami-Dade County to continue its recount, but the Florida Supreme Court refused to consider the request.

As the manual recounts continued, the battle to certify the results intensified. On November 17, Judge Terry Lewis of Leon County Circuit Court permitted Harris to certify the election results without the manual recounts, but on the same day, the Florida Supreme Court stayed that decision until it could consider an appeal by Gore. On November 21, the Florida Supreme Court ruled unanimously that manual counts in Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade Counties must be included and set 5:00 p.m. on November 26 as the earliest time for certification. After that decision, the Bush campaign appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the state court effectively rewrote state election statutes after the vote.

===Overseas absentee ballots===
As the manual recounts progressed, most of Florida&#x27;s counties were considering overseas absentee ballots. That part of the vote count was completed on November 18, increasing Bush&#x27;s lead to 930 votes. Because recounts later showed that Gore had actually won the election day vote, it was the margin in overseas absentee ballots that won Bush the election. After the election, a &quot;New York Times&quot; six month long investigation showed that 680 of the overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted. It further claimed that this was due to &quot;blatantly illegal actions on the part of local election officials, encouraged by Republicans.&quot; A 2004 analysis of those votes by Kosuke Imai and Gary King determined that if the bad ballots had been litigated (which they were not) and disqualified, Gore would have cut the margin, but probably not by enough to win without winning other votes elsewhere.

===Certification and recount continuation===
The Palm Beach County recount and the Miami-Dade County recount (having been suspended) were still incomplete at 5:00 p.m. on November 26, when Harris certified the statewide vote count with Bush ahead by 537 votes. The next day, Gore sued under Florida&#x27;s statutory construct of the &quot;contest phase&quot;. On November 28, Judge N. Sanders Sauls of Leon County Circuit Court rejected Gore&#x27;s request to include the recount results from Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties. Gore appealed that decision to the Florida Supreme Court. 

=== U.S. Supreme Court involvement===
The U.S. Supreme Court convened on December 1 to consider Bush&#x27;s appeal of the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s November 21 decision extending the certification date.

On December 4, Sauls rejected Gore&#x27;s contest of the election result; Gore appealed. Also on December 4, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Florida Supreme Court to clarify its ruling that had extended the certification date.

On December 6, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature convened a special session to appoint a slate of electors pledged to Bush, based on the fact that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to determine how their electors are appointed. Some have argued that awarding the electors in this manner would be illegal.

On December 8, the Florida justices, by a 4–3 vote, rejected the selective use of manual recounts in just four counties and ordered immediate manual recounts of all ballots in the state where no vote for president had been machine-recorded, also known as undervotes.

===Recount ended===
On December 9, the U.S. Supreme Court suspended the manual recount, in progress for only several hours, on the grounds that irreparable harm could befall Bush, according to a concurring opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia.

On December 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; that the recount must stop because it lacked a uniform statewide methodology and there was insufficient time to create one and complete the recount. The same day, the Florida House approved awarding the state&#x27;s electoral votes to Bush, but the matter was moot after the Court&#x27;s ruling. 

===Gore concedes===
On December 13, Gore conceded the election to Bush in a nationally televised address.

==Lingering controversies==
During the recount, controversy ensued with the discovery of various irregularities that had occurred in the voting process in several counties. Among these was the Palm Beach &quot;butterfly ballot&quot;, which resulted in an unusually high number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. Conservatives claimed that the same ballot had been successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office, but only for referenda. Also, before the election, the Secretary of State&#x27;s office ordered county election officials to expunge tens of thousands of citizens identified as felons from the Florida voting rolls, using a list that later demonstrated error levels of 15% or greater. Black people were identified on some counties&#x27; lists at up to five times their share of the population.
A December 4 article exposing flaws in the process correctly claimed that many of these were not felons and should have been eligible to vote under Florida law. The demographics of the list strongly suggested that, of those who were wrongly on the list and thus should have been able to vote, an overwhelming number of Black people would have chosen the Democratic nominee. 

Additionally, this Florida election produced many more &quot;overvotes&quot; than usual, especially in predominantly African-American precincts in Duval County (Jacksonville), where some 21,000 ballots had multiple markings, such as two or more choices for president. Unlike the much-discussed Palm Beach County butterfly ballot, the Duval County ballot spread choices for president over two non-facing pages. At the same time that the Bush campaign was contesting hand recounts in Democratic counties, it accepted hand recounts in Republican counties that gained it 185 votes, including where Republican Party workers had been permitted to correct errors on thousands of applications for Republicans&#x27; absentee ballots.

Political commentator and author Jeff Greenfield observed that the Republican operatives in Florida talked and acted like combat platoon sergeants in what one called &quot;switchblade time&quot;, the biggest political fight of the century. On the other hand, he said, Democrats talked like referees with a fear of pushing too hard, not wanting to be seen as sore losers.

===Controversial issues===
Various flaws and improprieties in Florida&#x27;s electoral processes were immediately apparent, while others were reported after later investigation. Controversies included:
* All five major U.S. TV news networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox and CNN) assumed that they could confidently call a winner in any state &quot;where the vast majority of polls had closed&quot;, based on history. No call in a state with two different poll-closing times had ever turned out wrong. While most of Florida is in the Eastern time zone, polls in the westernmost counties in Florida were open for another hour, until 8:00 p.m. EST, as they are in the Central time zone. The network calls were made about ten minutes before the polls in the Central time zone closed, based on the Voter News Service calling the state of Florida for Gore at 7:48 p.m. EST. This region of the state traditionally voted mostly Republican. A survey estimate by John McLaughlin &amp; Associates put the number of voters who might not have voted due to the networks&#x27; call as high as 15,000, which could have reduced Bush&#x27;s margin of victory by an estimated 5,000 votes; a study by conservative researcher John Lott found that Bush&#x27;s margin of victory was reduced by 7,500 votes. This survey assumed that the turnout in the Panhandle counties, which was 65%, would have equaled the statewide average of 68% if the state had not been called for Gore while the polls were still open. But the relatively smaller turnout percentage in the Panhandle has been attributed to the surge in the Black vote elsewhere in Florida to 16% of the total, from 10% of the total in 1996. Research conducted by Henry Brady and David Collier strongly disputed Lott and McLaughlin&#x27;s findings. Brady and Collier were sharply critical of Lott&#x27;s methodology and claimed when all relevant factors are accounted for, Bush was likely cost only between 28 and 56 votes. In a 2010 television special by the TV Guide Network, the &quot;2000 Election Flip Flop Coverage&quot; ranked #3 on a list of the 25 biggest TV blunders, having caused news outlets to change the way they report on election night.

* Democratic State Senator Daryl Jones said that there had to have been an order to set up roadblocks in heavily Democratic regions of the state on the day of the election. The Voting Section of the U. S. Department of Justice later investigated reports from the Tallahassee and Tampa areas and concluded that there was no evidence that roadblocks were related to the election or had occurred in close proximity to voting places.
* On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for Secretary of State Katherine Harris that said overseas ballots must be &quot;postmarked or signed and dated&quot; by Election Day. It was never released. Harris did send out a letter saying that absentee ballots without postmarks must be discarded, but Florida&#x27;s attorney general subsequently said they should not be. On November 13, Harris issued her first statement on overseas ballots, saying that they had to be &quot;executed&quot; on or before Election Day, not &quot;postmarked on or prior to&quot; Election Day. Over Thanksgiving, 14 county boards decided to include 288 overseas ballots that had been rejected days earlier, an act dubbed the &quot;Thanksgiving stuffing&quot;.
* On November 14, Democratic lawyer Mark Herron authored a memo on how to challenge flawed ballots, including overseas ballots cast by members of the military. It gave postmark and &quot;point of origin&quot; criteria that Herron maintained could be used to challenge overseas ballots. It was in line with a letter Harris sent stating that if an overseas ballot had no postmark, it had to be thrown out. Meanwhile, Republicans relied on their own 52-page manual for the same purpose. But on November 19, Democratic vice-presidential candidate Senator Joseph I. Lieberman appeared on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and said that election officials should give the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; to military voters rather than disqualifying any overseas ballots that lacked required postmarks or witness signatures. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, a Gore supporter, later told the counties to reconsider ballots without a postmark. Before that, the Democrats had pursued a strategy of persuading counties to strictly enforce postmark requirements by disqualifying illegal ballots from overseas, which were predominantly for Bush. In contrast, Republicans pursued a strategy of disqualifying overseas ballots in counties that favored Gore and pressuring elections officials to include flawed overseas ballots in Bush counties. 

* A suit by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (&quot;NAACP v. Harris&quot;) argued that Florida was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A settlement agreement was reached in this suit with ChoicePoint, the owner of DBT Online, a contractor involved in preparing Florida&#x27;s voter roll purge list.
* Four counties distributed sample ballots to voters that differed from the actual ballot used on election day, including Duval County, which used a caterpillar ballot, so called because the list of presidential candidates stretched over two pages. The instructions on the sample ballots said &quot;Vote every page&quot;. More than 20% of ballots in Black precincts of Duval County were rejected because of votes for president on each page. Further, counties and precincts with large Black populations disproportionately had technologies where ballots would predictably go uncounted. In punch-card counties, 1 in 25 ballots had uncountable presidential votes, while counties that used paper ballots scanned by computers at voting places (to give voters a chance to correct their ballot if it had an error) had just 1 in 200 uncountable ballots. A systematic investigation by the United States Commission on Civil Rights concluded that although Black people made up 11% of Florida&#x27;s voting population, they cast 54% of the uncounted ballots. 
* Between May 1999 and Election Day 2000, two Florida secretaries of state, Sandra Mortham and Katherine Harris, contracted with DBT Online Inc., at a cost of $4.294 million, to have the &quot;scrub lists&quot; reworked. In a May 2000 list, over 57,000 voters were identified as felons, and counties were ordered to remove all listed names from their voting rolls. Democrats claimed that many simply had names similar to actual felons, some listed &quot;felonies&quot; were dated years in the future, and some were random. Some counties refused to use the list, finding it error-ridden. In other counties, supervisors of elections notified those at risk of being scrubbed, giving them a chance to prove they were not felons, which a small number did. In most cases, those on the scrub list were not told that they were not allowed to vote until they were turned away at the polls. An estimated 15% of the names on the county lists were in error. Florida was the only state in the nation to contract the first stage of removal of voting rights to a private company and did so with directions not to use cross-checks or the company&#x27;s sophisticated verification plan.
* Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris was ultimately responsible for oversight of the state&#x27;s elections and certification of the results, even though she had served as a co-chair of the Bush campaign in Florida. Furthermore, George W. Bush&#x27;s brother Jeb Bush was serving his first of two terms as the governor of Florida at the time. Although Jeb Bush recused himself from involvement in the recount, Democrats alleged there was still an appearance of possible impropriety.
* Some observers, such as Washington County Elections Chief Carol Griffen, have argued that Florida violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by requiring those convicted of felonies in other states (and who had their rights restored by said states) to request clemency and a restoration of their rights from the governor, a process that could take two years and ultimately was left to the governor&#x27;s discretion. In 1998, &quot;Schlenther v. Florida Department of State&quot; held that Florida could not prevent a man convicted of a felony in Connecticut, where his civil rights had not been lost, from exercising his right to vote.
* The Brooks Brothers riot: A raucous demonstration by several dozen paid activists, mostly Republican House aides from Washington, flown in at Republican Party expense to protest Miami-Dade County&#x27;s manual recount. The recount was shut down a couple hours after the screaming protesters arrived at the county offices, where they began pounding on the doors, chanting and threatening to bring in a thousand Republicans from the Cuban-American community. Some Republicans contend that their demonstration was peaceful and was in response to the Miami-Dade election board&#x27;s decision to move the ballot counting to a smaller room closer to the ballot-scanning machines to speed up the process. The election board consisted of three appointees, Myriam Lehr and David Leahy, who were Independents, and Lawrence King, a Democrat. After the demonstration, which took place in view of multiple national network television cameras, the election board reversed its decision to recount ballots, determining that it could not do so by the court-issued deadline. The Republican representatives involved in the recount effort claim this demonstration, dubbed the &quot;Brooks Brothers Riot&quot; because of the suits and Hermès ties the Republican operatives wore, was a key factor in &quot;preventing the stealing of the 2000 presidential election&quot;.
* The suppression of vote pairing. Several websites sprang up to match Nader supporters in swing states like Florida with Gore supporters in non-swing states like Texas. For example, Nader supporters in Florida would vote for Gore, and Gore supporters in Texas would vote for Nader. This was intended to allow Nader to get his fair share of the vote, perhaps meeting the threshold to allow the Green Party to participate in the presidential debates in the 2004 election, while helping Gore carry swing states. Six Republican state secretaries of state, led by Bill Jones of California, threatened the websites with criminal prosecution and caused some of them to shut down. The ACLU became involved in a legal effort to protect the sites, and the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Jones seven years later. The vote-pairing sites allegedly tallied 1,412 Nader supporters in Florida who voted for Gore.
* The actions of the Florida Supreme Court. At the time, six of the Court&#x27;s seven justices were Democratic appointees. It was argued, particularly by Republicans, that the court was exceeding its authority and issuing partisan rulings biased in Gore&#x27;s favor. On November 17, the court acted &quot;on its own motion&quot; to stay official certification of the election until it could hear Gore&#x27;s appeal of Harris&#x27;s decision to reject late-filed hand recounts, while specifically allowing counting of absentee and other ballots to continue, an action the Gore legal team did not request. Similarly, in a 4–3 decision on December 8, the court ordered a statewide counting of undervotes, which Gore&#x27;s team had also not requested. Among other Republicans, James Baker called this ruling &quot;inconsistent with Florida law&quot;, on which basis Bush appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats argued that the Florida Supreme Court was simply trying to ensure a fair and accurate count. 
* While the Bush campaign opposed the Gore campaign&#x27;s requests for manual recounts in four heavily Democratic counties, it quietly accepted manual recounts in four Republican-leaning counties. Polk, Hamilton, Seminole, and Taylor, which used the more reliable optical scanners and manually examined unreadable ballots (both undervotes and overvotes) during the electronic recounts in accordance with those counties&#x27; existing policies (see County-by-county standards below). These manual counts gained Bush 185 votes.

===Palm Beach County&#x27;s butterfly ballot===
Many voters in Palm Beach County who intended to vote for Gore actually marked their ballots for Pat Buchanan or spoiled their ballots because they found the ballot&#x27;s layout confusing. The ballot displayed the list of presidential running-mate pairs alternately across two adjacent pages, with a column of punch spaces down the middle. Bush&#x27;s name appeared at the top of the ballot, sparing most Bush voters from error. About 19,000 ballots were spoiled because of overvotes (two votes in the same race), compared to 3,000 in 1996. According to a 2001 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;, the voting errors caused by the butterfly ballot cost Gore the election: &quot;Had PBC used a ballot format in the presidential race that did not lead to systematic biased voting errors, our findings suggest that, other things equal, Al Gore would have won a majority of the officially certified votes in Florida.&quot;

On November 9, 2000, Buchanan said on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it&#x27;s very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for Al Gore.&quot;

Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said on November 9 that &quot;Palm Beach County is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that&#x27;s why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there&quot;. Buchanan&#x27;s Florida coordinator, Jim McConnell, called that &quot;nonsense&quot;, and Jim Cunningham, chairman of the executive committee of Palm Beach County&#x27;s Reform Party, responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t think so. Not from where I&#x27;m sitting and what I&#x27;m looking at.&quot; Cunningham estimated that Palm Beach County&#x27;s Buchanan supporters numbered between 400 and 500. Asked how many votes he would guess Buchanan legitimately received in Palm Beach County, he said: &quot;I think 1,000 would be generous. Do I believe that these people inadvertently cast their votes for Pat Buchanan? Yes, I do. We have to believe that based on the vote totals elsewhere.&quot;

The ballot had been redesigned earlier that year by Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore, a member of the Democratic Party. She said that she used both sides of the ballot in order to make the candidate names larger, so that the county&#x27;s elderly residents could see the names more easily.

===Influential decisions===
====Florida Supreme Court appeals====

The case of &quot;Palm Beach Canvassing Board v. Katherine Harris&quot; (also known as &quot;Harris I&quot;) was a lawsuit about whether county canvassing boards had authority to extend manual recounts in order to inspect ballots for which the machine counter did not register a vote. The court ruled that counties had that authority, and to allow time for these efforts, extended the statutory deadline for the manual recounts. It also stayed the state certification to November 26.

There were two main issues:
* Whether the county canvassing boards&#x27; authority to conduct manual recounts to correct &quot;errors in the vote tabulation&quot; extended to efforts to remedy situations where machines, though perhaps correctly functioning to detect properly marked ballots, did not count votes on certain ballots on which votes might be found under a manual inspection with an &quot;intent of the voter&quot; standard (Harris had ruled that it did not); and
* How such recounts in the case at hand could be made to fit into the statutory scheme, which, as Harris interpreted it, contemplated a quick certification followed, if necessary, by an election contest during which a court (rather than the canvassing boards) would be empowered to correct errors.

Regarding the first issue, the court ruled that, while Harris was generally entitled to deference in her interpretation of state laws, in this case the interpretation &quot;contravene[d] the plain meaning&quot; of the phrase &quot;error in the vote tabulation&quot; and so must be overturned.

Regarding the second issue, the court ruled that the statutory scheme must be interpreted in light of the Florida state constitution&#x27;s declaration that &quot;all political power is inherent in the people,&quot; with any ambiguities therefore construed &quot;liberally&quot;. Preventing the canvassing boards from continuing to conduct recounts beyond the seven-day timeframe (specified in the law, but with ambiguity as to how firm it was intended to be), would &quot;summarily disenfranchise innocent electors [voters]&quot; and could not be allowed unless the recounts continued for so long as to &quot;compromise the integrity of the electoral process.&quot; The court ordered counties to submit returns by November 26, until which time the stay of certification would stand.

Aside from this case, also in dispute were the criteria that each county&#x27;s canvassing board would use in examining the overvotes and/or undervotes. Numerous local court rulings went both ways, some ordering recounts because the vote was so close and others declaring that a selective manual recount in a few heavily Democratic counties would be unfair.

Eventually, the Gore campaign appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered the recount to proceed. The Bush campaign subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which took up the case &quot;Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board&quot; on December 1. On December 4, the U.S. Supreme Court returned this matter to the Florida Supreme Court with an order vacating its earlier decision. In its opinion, the Supreme Court cited several areas where the Florida Supreme Court had violated both the federal and Florida constitutions. The Court further held that it had &quot;considerable uncertainty&quot; as to the reasons given by the Florida Supreme Court for its decision. The Florida Supreme Court clarified its ruling on this matter while the United States Supreme Court was deliberating &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;.

At 4:00 p.m. EST on December 8, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4 to 3 vote, rejected Gore&#x27;s original four-county approach and ordered a manual recount, under the supervision of the Leon County Circuit Court and Leon County Elections Supervisor Ion Sancho, of all undervoted ballots in all Florida counties (except Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia) and the portion of Miami-Dade county in which such a recount was not already complete. That decision was announced on live worldwide television by the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s spokesman Craig Waters, the Court&#x27;s public information officer. The results of this tally were to be added to the November 26 tally.

====U.S. Supreme Court proceedings====

The recount was in progress on December 9 when the United States Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissenting), granted Bush&#x27;s emergency plea for a stay of the Florida Supreme Court recount ruling, stopping the incomplete recount.

About 10 p.m. EST on December 12, the United States Supreme Court handed down its ruling. Seven of the nine justices saw constitutional problems with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution in the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s plan for recounting ballots, citing differing vote-counting standards from county to county and the lack of a single judicial officer to oversee the recount. By a 5–4 vote the justices reversed and remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court &quot;for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion&quot;, prior to the optional &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline which the Florida court had said the state intended to meet. With only two hours remaining until the December 12 deadline, the Supreme Court&#x27;s order effectively ended the recount.

The decision was extremely controversial due to its partisan split and the majority&#x27;s unusual instruction that its judgment in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; should not set precedent but should be &quot;limited to the present circumstances&quot;. Gore said he disagreed with the Court&#x27;s decision, but conceded the election.

Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris&#x27;s certification of the election results was thus upheld, allowing Florida&#x27;s electoral votes to be cast for Bush, making him president-elect.

====Florida counties&#x27; recount decisions====
Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth in his advisory opinion to county canvassing boards wrote:
Conservative writer Andrew Sullivan in a contemporaneous article:

Florida Code Section 101.5614[5] states that no vote &quot;shall be declared invalid or void if there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter.&quot; A physical mark on a ballot, at or near a designated target, is such an indication.

==Post-election studies==
According to factcheck.org, &quot;Nobody can say for sure who might have won. A full, official recount of all votes statewide could have gone either way, but one was never conducted.&quot; CNN and PBS reported that, had the recount continued with its existing standards, Bush would likely have still tallied more votes, but variations of those standards (and/or of which precincts were recounted) could have swung the election either way. They also concluded that had a full recount of all undervotes and overvotes taken place, Gore would have won, though his legal team never pursued such an option.

=== NORC-sponsored Florida Ballot Project recount ===
The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, sponsored by a consortium of major U.S. news organizations, conducted the Florida Ballot Project, a comprehensive review of ballots collected from the entire state, not just the disputed counties that were recounted. NORC investigators were able to examine 175,010 ballots, 99.2% of Florida&#x27;s total, but county officials were unable to deliver &quot;as many as 2,200 problem ballots&quot; to NORC. Some counties produced their rejected ballots by rerunning all ballots through tabulation machines but were unable to deliver all problem ballots because machines accepted more ballots than previously certified and rejected fewer. The project ended up using a sample that was 1,333 votes fewer than the expected total of votes, with most of the variation in Votomatic overvotes, the ballots least likely to yield votes in a recount. The 175,010 ballots examined contained &quot;undervotes&quot; (votes with no choice made for president) and &quot;overvotes&quot; (votes made with more than one choice marked). The organization analyzed 61,190 undervotes and 113,820 overvotes. Of the overvotes, 68,476 chose Gore and a minor candidate; 23,591 chose Bush and a minor candidate. Because there was no clear indication of what the voters intended, those numbers were not included in the consortium&#x27;s final tabulations.

The project&#x27;s goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used in the voting process, including how different systems correlated with voter mistakes. The undervotes and overvotes in Florida amounted to 3% of all votes cast in the state. The review&#x27;s findings were reported in the media during the week after November 12, 2001, by the organizations that funded the recount: Associated Press, CNN, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; and Tribune Publishing, which included the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

Based on the NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over the validity of all the ballots in question had been consistently resolved and any uniform standard applied, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes (with, for each punch ballot, at least two of the three ballot reviewers&#x27; codes being in agreement). The standards that were chosen for the NORC study ranged from a &quot;most restrictive&quot; standard (accepts only so-called perfect ballots that machines somehow missed and did not count, or ballots with unambiguous expressions of voter intent) to a &quot;most inclusive&quot; standard (applies a uniform standard of &quot;dimple or better&quot; on punch marks and &quot;all affirmative marks&quot; on optical scan ballots).

An analysis of the NORC data by University of Pennsylvania researcher Steven F. Freeman and journalist Joel Bleifuss concluded that, no matter what standard is used, after a recount of all uncounted votes, Gore would have been the victor. Such a statewide review including all uncounted votes was a tangible possibility, as Leon County Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis, whom the Florida Supreme Court had assigned to oversee the statewide recount, had scheduled a hearing for December 13 (mooted by the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s final ruling on December 12) to consider including overvotes. Subsequent statements by Lewis and internal court documents support the likelihood that overvotes would have been included in the recount. Florida State University professor of public policy Lance deHaven-Smith observed that, even considering only undervotes, &quot;under any of the five most reasonable interpretations of the Florida Supreme Court ruling, Gore does, in fact, more than make up the deficit&quot;. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&#x27;s analysis of the NORC study and media coverage of it supported these interpretations and criticized the coverage of the study by media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the other media consortium members for focusing on how events might have played out rather than on the statewide vote count.



The NORC was expecting 176,446 uncounted ballots to be available from Florida&#x27;s counties, based on county precinct reports that produced the final, state-certified vote totals.

Orange County presented fewer rejected ballots to the NORC than expected. When the county segregated all ballots by machine for the NORC review, 512 previously rejected ballots were determined to be completely valid. Orange County then performed a hand segregation and determined that these votes numbered 184 for Bush, 249 for Gore and 79 for other candidates.

The NORC adjusted its analysis for the Orange County results and a few minor differences by increasing the starting baseline vote total by 535 votes. In addition, some counties had provided an extra 432 total ballots, while others produced 1,333 fewer ballots than expected. As adjusted, 176,343 ballots were expected, compared to 175,010 ballots actually provided to the NORC for review. The county-level variance from the total number of ballots was 0.76%. Thus the project included a sample within less than 1% of the expected total of votes.

Only a fourth of the variance consisted of optical ballots. Most of the variation occurred in Votomatic overvotes, the least likely ballots to yield votes in a recount. Among the nearly 85,000 Votomatic overvotes in the sample, only 721 reclaimable votes were confirmed in the NORC study.

===Media recounts===
From the beginning of the controversy, politicians, litigants and the press focused exclusively on the undervotes, in particular incompletely punched hanging chads. Undervotes (ballots that did not register any vote when counted by machine) were the subject of much media coverage, most of the lawsuits and the Florida Supreme Court ruling. After the election, recounts conducted by various United States news media organizations continued to focus on undervotes. Based on the review of these ballots, their results indicated that Bush would have won if certain recounting methods had been used (including the one favored by Gore at the time of the Supreme Court decision), but that Gore might have won under other standards and scenarios. The post-controversy recounts revealed that, &quot;if a manual recount had been limited to undervotes, it would have produced an inaccurate picture of the electorate&#x27;s position.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, and Knight Ridder commissioned accounting firm BDO Seidman to count undervotes. BDO Seidman&#x27;s results, reported in &quot;USA Today&quot;, show that under the strictest standard, where only a cleanly punched ballot with a fully removed chad was counted, Gore&#x27;s margin was three votes. Under the other standards used in the study, Bush&#x27;s margin of victory increased as looser standards were used. The standards considered by BDO Seidman were:
* Lenient standard. Any alteration in a chad, ranging from a dimple to a full punch, counts as a vote. By this standard, Bush margin: 1,665 votes.
* Palm Beach standard. A dimple is counted as a vote if other races on the same ballot show dimples as well. By this standard, Bush margin: 884 votes.
* Two-corner standard. A chad with two or more corners removed is counted as a vote. This is the most common standard in use. By this standard, Bush margin: 363 votes.
* Strict standard. Only a fully removed chad counts as a vote. By this standard, Gore margin: 3 votes.

The study notes that because of the possibility of mistakes, it is difficult to conclude that Gore would have won under the strict standard or that a high degree of certainty obtained in the study&#x27;s results. It also remarks that there were variations between examiners and that election officials often did not provide the same number of undervotes as were counted on Election Day. Furthermore, the study did not consider overvotes, ballots that registered more than one vote when counted by machine.
The study also found that undervotes originating in optical-scan counties differ from those from punch card counties in a particular characteristic. Undervotes from punch card counties give new votes to candidates in roughly the same proportion as the county&#x27;s official vote. Furthermore, the number of undervotes correlates with how well the punch-card machines are maintained, and not with factors such as race or socioeconomic status. Undervotes from optical-scan counties, however, correlate with Democratic votes more than Republican votes, and in particular to counties that scanned ballots at a central location rather than at precinct locations. Optical-scan counties were the only places in the study where Gore gained more votes than Bush, 1,036 to 775.

Some media reports focused on undervotes (chad blocked hole, wrong ink or pencil used, partial oval mark not detected, humidity affected scanner, ballot feeder misalignment), while others also included overvotes (hole punched or oval filled plus a write-in name, other multi-marked ballots). A larger consortium of news organizations, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, Knight Ridder, &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, and five other newspapers next conducted a full recount of all machine-rejected ballots, including both undervotes and overvotes. The organization analyzed 171,908 ballots (60,647 undervotes and 111,261 overvotes), 3102 less than the later NORC study. According to their results, Bush won under stricter standards and Gore won under looser standards. A Gore win was impossible without a recount of overvotes, which he did not request; however, faxes between Judge Terry Lewis and the canvassing boards throughout the state indicated that Lewis, who oversaw the recount effort, intended to have overvotes counted.

According to the study, 3146 (3%) of the 111,261 examined overvotes &quot;contained clear and therefore legally valid votes not counted in any of the manual recounts during the dispute.&quot; According to Anthony Salvado, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who acted as a consultant on the media recount, most of the errors were caused by ballot design, ballot wording, and efforts by voters to choose both a president and a vice president. For example, 21,188 of the Florida overvotes, or nearly one-fifth of the total, originated from Duval County, where the presidential ballot was split across two pages and voters were instructed to &quot;vote every page&quot;. Half of the overvotes in Duval County had one presidential candidate marked on each page, making their vote illegal under Florida law. Salvado says that this alone cost Gore the election.

Including overvotes in the above totals for undervotes gives different margins of victory:
* Lenient standard. Gore margin: 332 votes.
* Palm Beach standard. Gore margin: 242 votes.
* Two-corner standard. Bush margin: 407 votes.
* Strict standard. Bush margin: 152 votes.

The overvotes with write-in names were also noted by Florida State University public policy professor and elections observer, Lance deHaven-Smith, in his interview with &quot;Research in Review at Florida State University&quot;:

:: ...Everybody had thought that the chads were where all the bad ballots were, but it turned out that the ones that were the most decisive were write-in ballots where people would check Gore and write Gore in, and the machine kicked those out. There were 175,000 votes overall that were so-called &quot;spoiled ballots&quot;. About two-thirds of the spoiled ballots were over-votes; many or most of them would have been write-in over-votes, where people had punched and written in a candidate&#x27;s name. And nobody looked at this, not even the Florida Supreme Court in the last decision it made requiring a statewide recount. Nobody had thought about it except Judge Terry Lewis, who was overseeing the statewide recount when it was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court. The write-in over-votes have really not gotten much attention. Those votes are not ambiguous. When you see Gore picked and then Gore written in, there&#x27;s not a question in your mind who this person was voting for. When you go through those, they&#x27;re unambiguous: Bush got some of those votes, but they were overwhelmingly for Gore. For example, in an analysis of the 2.7 million votes that had been cast in Florida&#x27;s eight largest counties, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found that Gore&#x27;s name was punched on 46,000 of the over-vote ballots it, [&quot;sic&quot;] while Bush&#x27;s name was marked on only 17,000... 

Furthermore, the Florida Administrative Code: 1S-2.0031, &quot;Write-in Procedures Governing Electronic Voting Systems&quot;, (7) at the time specified, &quot;An overvote shall occur when an elector casts a vote on the ballot card and also casts a write-in vote for a &quot;qualified&quot; write-in candidate for that same office. Upon such an overvote, the entire vote for that office shall be void and shall not be counted. However, an overvote shall not occur when the elector casts a vote on the ballot card but then enters a sham or unqualified name in the write-in space for that same office. In such case, only the write-in vote is void.&quot; There were two write-in candidates for president who had been qualified by the state of Florida. Under the FAC, a ballot with any other name written in (including Bush and Gore, who were not qualified as write-in candidates) was &quot;not&quot; an overvote, but rather a valid vote for the candidate whose name was marked by the voter.

===County-by-county standards for write-in overvotes in 2000===

===Opinion polling on recount===
A nationwide December 14–21, 2000 Harris poll asked, &quot;If everyone who tried to vote in Florida had their votes counted for the candidate who they thought they were voting for—with no misleading ballots and infallible voting machines—who do you think would have won the election, George W. Bush or Al Gore?&quot;. The results were 49% for Gore and 40% for Bush, with 11% uncertain or not wishing to respond.

== Television film ==

<text>Drawn-on-film animation, also known as direct animation or animation without camera, is an animation technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock, as opposed to any other form of animation where the images or objects are photographed frame by frame with an animation camera.

==History==

The first and best known practitioners of drawn-on-film animation include Len Lye, Norman McLaren, Stan Brakhage, then later artists including Steven Woloshen, Richard R. Reeves, Scott Fitzpatrick and Baerbel Neubauer, who produced numerous animated films using these methods. Their work covers the whole span between narrative and totally abstract animation. Other filmmakers in the 1960s expanded the idea and subjected the film stock to increasingly radical methods, up to the point where the film was destroyed in the process projection. Some artists made this destruction a statement, others went back one step and copied the original work film strip to get a projection copy.

Direct animation can be an inexpensive way to produce a film; it can even be done on outtakes, or discarded film strips from other projects. It is a form of animation that is inviting to beginners and accomplished artists alike. Norman McLaren wrote a short illustrated introduction &quot;How to make animated movies without a camera&quot; which was originally published by UNESCO in 1949. Helen Hill published a collection called Recipes for Disaster that includes a wide range of approaches to creating images directly on film.

==Techniques==

There are two basic methods to produce animation directly on film. One starts with blank film stock, the other one with black (already developed) film. On blank film the artist can draw, paint, stamp, or even glue or tape objects. Black film (or any footage) can be scratched, etched, sanded, or punched. Any tool the artist finds useful may be used for this, and all techniques can be combined endlessly. The frame borders may be observed or completely ignored, found footage may be included, any existing image might be distorted by mechanical or chemical means. A third method takes place in a darkroom, using unexposed film that is exposed frame by frame. The artists places objects onto the fresh stock and then uses a small light beam to create the images. This third category of work has to be sent to a lab and processed, just like films created with a camera.

Large formats such as 70 or 35mm film may be preferred for their relatively larger working area, but direct animation is done on 16 mm or even Super 8 mm film as well. Since the sound strip on 35 mm film is optical, it is possible to create synthetic sound as well as images by drawing or otherwise reproducing forms in the soundtrack area.

==Animators and films==

* In 1912, Italian futurists Arnaldo Ginna and Bruno Corra discuss their nine abstract films (eight of which are now lost) in their text &quot;Abstract Cinema – Chromatic Music.&quot;
* In 1916, American concert pianist Mary Hallock-Greenewalt produced hand-painted film strips, possibly intended for projection in her color organ, Sarabet.
* In 1926 Man Ray created &quot;Emak Bakia&quot;, which includes sequences made by exposing film directly to light.
* In 1935 Len Lye created the first direct film screened to a general audience, a promotion for the British General Post Office entitled &quot;A Colour Box&quot; as well as his movie &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;. Lye and Norman McLaren produced hand-painted films for John Grierson in the GPO Film Unit. Lye went on to create direct films in New York.
* Beginning in 1941, McLaren continued this work at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), founding the NFB&#x27;s animation unit. NFB direct films created or co-created by McLaren include &quot;Boogie-Doodle&quot; (1941), &quot;Hen Hop&quot; (1942),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hen Hop/NFB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Begone Dull Care&quot; (1949) and &quot;Blinkity Blank&quot; (1955).
* In 1946, Harry Smith produced hand-painted films in San Francisco which screened at the &quot;Art in Cinema&quot; series at the San Francisco Museum of Art.
* 1961 – &quot;O Átomo Brincalhão&quot; by Brazilian animator Roberto Miller. He worked at the National Film Board of Canada and later hosted a TV show about animation.

<text>Martin Sargent is an American television personality and was co-host of the This WEEK in FUN podcast with Sarah Lane. He is most well known from his time as a Segment Producer on TechTV&#x27;s &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; and later as the host of his own late night talk show &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;.

==Career==
Sargent&#x27;s first job after school was as an editor at PC/Computing magazine.

In 1998, Sargent joined the ZDTV (later TechTV) TV show &quot;Call For Help&quot; as the show&#x27;s &quot;Resident Craft Professional&quot; and substitute co-host. In 2001, he moved from &quot;Call For Help&quot; to another TechTV show, &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, and became known first as &quot;The Twisted Lister&quot;, for producing and presenting odd, &quot;twisted&quot; top-five lists on the show, and later for another segment, &quot;Site of the Night&quot;, in which he presented strange websites.

Sargent left &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; in April 2003, to host his own show, &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;, anchoring a newly introduced late-night programming block.

On March 25, 2004, Comcast&#x27;s G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4&#x27;s main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there. Sargent chose to stay with G4 and moved to Los Angeles.

Six months later, on November 11, 2004, G4TechTV canceled &quot;Unscrewed&quot; and terminated Sargent, along with many other former co-workers from TechTV.

Exactly one year after his termination, Sargent launched &quot;Infected&quot;, a comedy podcast distributed by the internet production company Revision3. Infected was hosted by Sargent and &quot;The Gator&quot; (portrayed by co-writer Jay Speiden, who died in December 2016), produced by Joey Rabier, and was structured as a conversation between co-hosts and producer, with fake &quot;commercials&quot; for various real and fictional products as well as occasional guest callers. Recurring callers included inventor Alex Chiu as well as the fictional characters Johnny O&#x27;Banion (portrayed by co-writer/producer Stewart Engesser), a Hollywood reporter and former Loni Anderson paramour, and karate master Rickey Kang (also played by Spieden). O&#x27;Banion and Kang were recurring characters on &quot;Infected&quot;, and Rabier acted as a production assistant on the show and also appeared as his &quot;intern&quot; character for selected skits. The podcast was originally available in audio-only format, then offered an alternative video version consisting of a montage of still photographs relating to the topic discussed and taken at the recording session. The video version has since been offered in full-motion video. Infected was canceled in December 2007, after 50 episodes.

Sargent hosted &quot;Web Drifter&quot; and Internet Superstar on Revision3 and &quot;Why Today Sucked&quot;, on GoTV Network&#x27;s &quot;Laugh Riot&quot; channel, available for video-enabled cell phones on the Sprint network. &quot;Web Drifter&quot; began as a pilot originally pitched to Comedy Central, but it was picked up by Revision3 after the cable network passed on the show.

On January 30, 2008, the Revision3 website released the first episode of Martin Sargent&#x27;s new show, &quot;Internet Superstar&quot;.

As of October 27, 2008, he was made redundant as part of Revision3 layoffs. He has reappeared on Revision3 show &#x27;The Digg Reel&#x27; twice since he was laid off, once as acting co-host alongside Kevin Rose while regular host Andrew Bancroft was on vacation. In this appearance he expressed mock-anger that, as part of promotions within the show, other cancelled show &#x27;Pixel Perfect&#x27; has been revived, unlike his own shows. He appeared once more on The Digg Reel&#x27;s 100th episode, in which he jokingly stated that he secretly lived within the walls of the Revision3 building, resulting from his supposed inability to get another job.

Starting February 12, 2009, he and Sarah Lane appeared together in a Podcast on Leo Laporte&#x27;s TWiT.tv network called &quot;This Week in Fun&quot;. The show aired for just shy of a year before going on hiatus in January 2010, following Martin&#x27;s employment at Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco. The show was left on good terms with the TWiT network, though they have made no solid plans of returning to production.

In November 2009, Martin and long-time associate Molly McDonald became engaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;hippazoid/6075106881&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that operates in NCAA Division III. The conference was founded in 1915 and it consists of twelve small private schools that are located in Southern California and organized into nine athletic programs. Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Pomona-Pitzer are combined teams for sports purposes.

The SCIAC currently sponsors men&#x27;s baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, women&#x27;s volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s water polo.

==History==

A forerunner conference to the SCIAC was the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California, which existed in the 1890s. It included Occidental, Caltech (then called Throop Polytechnic), USC, Chaffey College and Los Angeles High School.

The SCIAC was founded in 1915 with five member schools with the goals to promote amateurism in athletics. The five founding members, all of whom are still members, are Throop College of Technology (now California Institute of Technology), Occidental College, Pomona College, the University of Redlands, and Whittier College. Although all five original charter members are still affiliated with the SCIAC, only two, Occidental and Redlands, have had uninterrupted membership. The acronym SCIAC (standing for Southern California Interscholastic Athletic Council) was in use during 1913 and 1914 until that organization became the CIF Southern Section.

On May 12, 2011, the SCIAC announced that Chapman University would become the ninth member, beginning with the 2011–12 academic year. The addition of Chapman marks the first expansion of the conference since California Lutheran University joined in 1991. At one time, most of the colleges were the southern California affiliates of various Christian sects such as the Quakers and the Presbyterians. Today, only California Lutheran University maintains an affiliation with a church.

There are three former members of the SCIAC: University of California, Los Angeles, San Diego State University and University of California, Santa Barbara. All former members now compete in NCAA Division I athletics.

<text>All-American Girl is an American television sitcom starring Margaret Cho. The series aired on ABC from September 14, 1994, to March 15, 1995. It was loosely based on Cho&#x27;s own experiences growing up in a Korean American family in San Francisco. Cho starred as Margaret Kim, the rebellious daughter of Korean emigrants and bookstore owners, whose American attitude often comes into conflict with her more traditional parents (Jodi Long and Clyde Kusatsu). Among her co-stars were BD Wong as Margaret&#x27;s brother, and Amy Hill as her eccentric grandmother.

&quot;All-American Girl&quot; was created by ABC to capitalize on the trend of female comediennes headlining their own sitcoms. Cho was included in a Wednesday night lineup that included other women in lead roles—Brett Butler (&quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;), Ellen DeGeneres (&quot;Ellen&quot;), and most successfully, Roseanne Barr (&quot;Roseanne&quot;).

The series received criticism for its depiction of Korean Americans and for stereotyping characters. ABC attempted to counter low ratings by retooling the show into an ensemble sitcom about Margaret and her white friends, but the revamping was unsuccessful and the series was cancelled after one season.

==Premise ==
&quot;All-American Girl&quot; takes place in San Francisco, where Margaret Kim tries to navigate life with her family, friends, and romantic partners. In the Kim family household, Margaret has many squabbles with her very traditional mother, Katherine, who wants nothing more than for her to settle down with a Korean boy and be successful. Her passive father plays more of the middle-man in these touchy debates, and prefers to spend time working in their family-owned bookstore. Also in the house are Margaret&#x27;s brothers — her successful older brother, Dr. Stuart Kim, and her admiring younger brother, Eric — and eccentric Grandma Kim. Margaret is a college student who frequently bounces between majors and works at the cosmetics counter of a department store with her friends, Ruthie and Gloria.

In the pilot episode of &quot;All-American Girl&quot;, &quot;Mom, Dad, This is Kyle&quot;, Margaret&#x27;s mother, Katherine Kim, strongly disapproves of Margaret&#x27;s white boyfriend Kyle, and constantly tries to set her up with successful, intelligent Korean men, a recurring conflict between Margaret and her mother. Margaret, tired of her mother&#x27;s constant matchmaking, convinces her to have Kyle over for dinner. At the dinner, Katherine makes no effort to accept Kyle, and a frustrated Margaret makes the rash decision to announce to everyone that she and Kyle are moving in together, simply to irritate her mother. Margaret realizes that she does not want to move out of the house and decides to stay in the end.

==Episodes==
==Production ==

=== Conception ===
&quot;All-American Girl&quot; was pitched to ABC amidst a boon of female-led sitcoms. The show&#x27;s creators suggested other titles for the series such as &quot;East Meets West&quot; and &quot;Wok on the Wild Side&quot;, before deciding on &quot;All-American Girl&quot;. Said Cho of the show&#x27;s concept:[It] is about two basic things: It&#x27;s about me having these two families that I don&#x27;t exactly relate to--my family at home, my biological family, who are very traditional, kind of strict and a very Asian, very Korean family. And they don&#x27;t understand me because I&#x27;m just too wild and too Americanized. And then there&#x27;s my family of friends who understand me but find me a little bit conservative. So I&#x27;m in between these kind of two extreme cultures. It&#x27;s something I think a lot of Asian Americans go through because many live at home in a more controlled environment and then they go out or watch TV and they&#x27;re exposed to this whole other world. [The series] is exploring the feelings associated with assimilation and becoming an American.&quot;All-American Girl&quot; was marketed as being based on Cho&#x27;s stand-up comedy routines, though Cho said that it &quot;was mostly just a gloss&quot; and used to attract fans of her stand-up. ABC also touted the series as the first TV sitcom to center Asian Americans; however, &quot;Mr. T and Tina&quot;, which centered on a Japanese American man and his two children, had aired on the network nearly two decades prior.

Unlike the stars of shows like &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, and &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, Cho said she had little input in the creative process. Before production began, ABC executives began criticizing Cho about her weight, although Cho claims there had been no issue about her weight before filming began. ABC executives and producers encouraged her to go on a crash diet; in two weeks, she lost 30 lbs (14 kg). This resulted in her having to be hospitalized for kidney failure, and leading to major health issues that continued for years after the show. In a later interview, Cho said she believes that because she was not white, executives and the producers felt they had to &quot;make up for it in other ways&quot;, which was the reasoning behind this.

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;All-American Girl&quot; premiered on ABC on September 14, 1994, airing at 9:30pm after &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Thereafter, it aired on the network&#x27;s Wednesday night comedy block at 8:30pm as the lead-in for &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;. The premiere episode drew in 16.8 million U.S. viewers, helping the network to a consecutive ratings victory for that week. After its premiere, ratings dropped substantially.

==Themes==
===Cultural and generational differences===
The Kim family is intended to be portrayed as a typical Asian American family, and a recurring concept is the clash of values between the more Americanized Margaret and her traditional parents. Among the values and expectations thought to be typical of Asian American culture that are exhibited by the Kim parents include obedience and respect for elders, a high regard of education and success, and placing the most importance on the eldest son.

===Femininity===
In &quot;All-American Girl&quot;, Margaret Kim comes across as a typical college-age girl with somewhat of a rebellious streak, much to the chagrin of her very no-nonsense mother. She has an edgy sense of style, wearing short dresses, leather outfits, and following the trends of the average American girl from the 1990s. She wears different clothes, speaks in a higher register, laughs daintily behind her hand, and comes across as very polite—a significant contrast from her typically brash character. She manipulates her femininity to get what she wants, but this inevitably backfires when she is rejected for not maintaining this desired on trait.

This issue of desirable female traits played a part in the production decisions behind the show. Producers told Cho to lose weight, resulting in her drastic weight loss of 30 pounds in two weeks and leaving lasting health complications. Said Cho, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have these attributes that [producers] think of when they think of like a female star of a show. You know, I wasn&#x27;t thin [and] I wasn&#x27;t white&quot;.

===Romantic relationships===
Throughout &quot;All-American Girl&quot;, Margaret Kim flutters around multiple male characters and maintains about 7 short-lived relationships, all of which last for only one episode. The first episode &quot;Mom, Dad, This is Kyle&quot;, centers on Margaret Kim and her American boyfriend Kyle, whom her mother constantly claims is a &quot;loser&quot; and that he is not right for her. Margaret then counters that her mother only disapproves of Kyle because he&#x27;s not Korean, and a fight ensues. Margaret does not in fact have strong feelings for Kyle, but she simply refuses to back down to her mother, who appears to be equally stubborn. In this sense, Margaret&#x27;s romantic relationship is downplayed in favor of highlighting the conflicting, but loving, relationship between Margaret and her mother. In the second episode, the opposite situation occurs and Margaret finds herself dating a Korean boy that her mother has set her up with. Margaret&#x27;s mother is ecstatic, but Margaret finds herself slowly altering her behavior to suit the desires of her Korean suitor—by the end of the episode, she ends the charade by coming clean about her true personality and their relationship ends. Unfortunately, because Margaret was honest and true to herself, she ends up losing a relationship due to the discrepancy between her &quot;American&quot; self and her &quot;Korean&quot; self. In subsequent episodes, Margaret finds herself dating a variety of male characters, including a professor, a handyman, and a criminal.

== Critical reception ==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 10 critics gave the series a positive review. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Margaret Cho acquits herself nicely as a leading lady, but &quot;All-American Girl&quot;&#x27;s hit-and-miss laugh quotient doesn&#x27;t measure up to her talents.&quot;

Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;There’s a smattering of warmth between these characters&quot; and Cho &quot;is instantly appealing with her product-of-suburbia shtick&quot;, but &quot;early scripts don’t provide material to define the character beyond her maternal sparring&quot; and there is &quot;not enough demonstrated early to lift the series beyond the most standard sitcom fare&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker lamented that the show was the complete opposite of Cho&#x27;s stand-up comedy, which he said &quot;is all about exploding ethnic myths, starting with the notion that a Korean-American woman is likely to be quiet and demure.&quot;

While reviews were positive about Cho and Hill, the series faced scrutiny from the Asian American community. Guy Aoki, head of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), said, &quot;If there is one Asian group that needed a show like this to take care of the misunderstandings people have about them, it&#x27;s Korean American. We see a family, and we don&#x27;t see rude grocers who shoot people randomly. I don&#x27;t think this show will solve all the problems, but given a chance to grow, it will sure help.&quot; Prior to the series premiere, Asian American advocacy groups such as MANAA monitored the pilot, read scripts and attended tapings. Members of the Korean American Coalition said they were unhappy with the episode, citing the episode&#x27;s &quot;confusion of various Asian cultures&quot; and the emphasized accents of characters. Others criticized stereotypes such as the &quot;tiger mother&quot;, the expectation for Korean women to be proper and demure, the overachieving nerdy Asian, and the obedient Asian child. Critics said there was a lack of development that allowed for characters, aside from Margaret, to have little depth beyond their perceived archetypes.

The series also received criticism for its casting. Cho was the only Korean American cast member; while BD Wong is of Chinese descent, Amy Hill and Clyde Kusatsu are of Japanese ancestry, and Jodi Long is of mixed Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Critics said this perpetuated the idea of Asians as a monolithic ethnic group, and argued Asian audiences should not be forced to &quot;identify with the Kims simply because they were Asian&quot;. Similarly, non-Asian audiences were equally unable to identify with &quot;yet another example of Hollywood&#x27;s ignorance and indifference when it comes to depicting an ethnic group about which it knows so little&quot;. As Cho stated later, &quot;When you&#x27;re the first person to cross over this racial barrier, you&#x27;re scrutinized for all these other things that have nothing to do with race, but they have everything to do with race — it&#x27;s a very strange thing&quot;.

Furthermore, the show&#x27;s use of &quot;butchered Korean language&quot; was criticized. With the majority of the cast not being Korean American, their ability to speak Korean was limited, and none of &quot;All-American Girl&#x27;s&quot; directors, writers, or producers were Korean American, though the writing staff included two Asian American writers and a Korean consultant was also hired. Staff writer Elizabeth Wong commented, &quot;This is not a show that deals with politics. It&#x27;s an 8:30 show that deals with family dynamics. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re interested in. But I very much feel a lot of pressure.&quot; Korean American viewers found the briefly spoken Korean phrases to be so flawed as to be essentially unintelligible. Show creator Gary Jacobs and BD Wong pushed back against criticism, with the latter saying, &quot;A heavy accent does not a stereotype make. People have accents and that’s what makes the show beautiful and the world beautiful. The accent is required for the role. This is what’s going on in this country. And now, in this very rare opportunity, we can show this on television.&quot;

Playwright Philip W. Chung wrote a defense of the show in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, arguing that as the only Asian American focused-TV show at the time, &quot;All-American Girl&quot; was subject to unfair expectations. Chung wrote, &quot;No show can single-handedly carry the burdens of an entire community. No one looks at the family on &#x27;&quot;The Brady Bunch&#x27;&quot; as a representation of all white families but, unfortunately, due to a lack of any real Asian American presence in the media, &#x27;&quot;All-American Girl&quot;&#x27; must become a symbol to a certain degree.&quot; In response to his opinion piece, Asian American industry groups voiced their support for the show, stating that &quot;while no one should blindly support any endeavor&quot;, they recognized the importance of Asian American representation as a whole and had engaged in a letter-writing campaign to persuade ABC to renew the series for a second season.

== Revamp and cancellation ==
The series struggled in the ratings from the beginning. ABC executives and producers constantly attempted to change the series’ format in an attempt to improve ratings. After negative reviews and controversy, episodes became less focused on the Kim family as a whole, and more centered on Margaret and Grandma Kim.

After the thirteenth episode, Ashley Johnson — who was added after the pilot — was written out of the series completely, while Ruthie, Gloria, and the rest of the Kims — besides Margaret and Grandma — appeared to be slowly phased out. Amy Hill was retained through these changes as Grandma Kim had become popular with audiences.

By the end of the first season, ABC had decided to revamp the series into a new series. The final episode &quot;Young Americans&quot; was intended to serve as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series of the same name. In the fifteenth episode &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot;, Margaret moves into the basement of her parents&#x27; home, then moves out altogether in &quot;Young Americans&quot;. The spin-off would have focused on Margaret and her roommates — Spencer (Diedrich Bader), Phil (Sam Seder), and Jimmy (Andrew Lowery) — plus Grandma Kim and Jane (Mariska Hargitay), a bartender at the roommates&#x27; hangout. The revamped concept was meant to emulate &quot;Friends&quot;, which had become a hit on rival network NBC that same season. Despite this retooling, ABC ultimately decided against ordering the revamped series.

== Legacy ==
Since the series&#x27; end, Cho has become outspoken about her time on the series, particularly the difficulties she faced with the network and the effects the series&#x27; failure had on her. Another attempt at bringing an Asian American family would not come until 2015, when ABC launched the much more successful &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot;. Footage from &quot;All-American Girl&quot; made a brief appearance in the ABC comedy series, where the characters poked fun at its faults. Cho later returned to ABC to guest star for another sitcom featuring an Asian American lead, &quot;Dr. Ken&quot;.

==Home media==
The complete series was released on DVD in a four-disc set from Shout! Factory/Sony BMG Music Entertainment on January 31, 2006. The set features commentary by Cho (joined twice by Hill) on one episode per disc and retrospective interviews with Cho and Hill.

<doc id="250959" wikidata="Q206492" url="?curid=250959" title="Laramide orogeny">
<text>The Laramide orogeny was a time period of mountain building in western North America, which started in the Late Cretaceous, 80 to 70 million years ago, and ended 55 to 35 million years ago. The exact duration and ages of beginning and end of the orogeny are in dispute. The Laramide orogeny occurred in a series of pulses, with quiescent phases intervening. The major feature that was created by this orogeny was deep-seated, thick-skinned deformation, with evidence of this orogeny found from Canada to northern Mexico, with the easternmost extent of the mountain-building represented by the Black Hills of South Dakota. The phenomenon is named for the Laramie Mountains of eastern Wyoming. The Laramide orogeny is sometimes confused with the Sevier orogeny, which partially overlapped in time and space.

The orogeny is commonly attributed to events off the west coast of North America, where the Kula and Farallon Plates were sliding under the North American Plate. Most hypotheses propose that oceanic crust was undergoing flat-slab subduction, that is, subduction at a shallow angle. As a consequence, no magmatism occurred in the central west of the continent, and the underlying oceanic lithosphere actually caused drag on the root of the overlying continental lithosphere. One cause for shallow subduction may have been an increased rate of plate convergence. Another proposed cause was subduction of thickened oceanic crust.

Magmatism associated with subduction occurred not near the plate edges (as in the volcanic arc of the Andes, for example), but far to the east, along the Colorado Mineral Belt. Geologists call such a lack of volcanic activity near a subduction zone a magmatic gap. This particular gap may have occurred because the subducted slab was in contact with relatively cool continental lithosphere, not hotter asthenosphere. One result of shallow angle of subduction and the drag that it caused was a broad belt of mountains, some of which were the progenitors of the Rocky Mountains. Part of the proto-Rocky Mountains would be later modified by extension to become the Basin and Range Province.

==Basins and mountains==
The Laramide orogeny produced intermontane structural basins and adjacent mountain blocks by means of deformation. This style of deformation is typical of continental plates adjacent to convergent margins of long duration that have not sustained continent/continent collisions. This tectonic setting produces a pattern of compressive uplifts and basins, with most of the deformation confined to block edges. Twelve kilometers of structural relief between basins and adjacent uplifts is not uncommon. The basins contain several thousand meters of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks that predate the Laramide orogeny. As much as of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments filled these orogenically-defined basins. Deformed Paleocene and Eocene deposits record continuing orogenic activity.

During the Laramide orogeny, basin floors and mountain summits were much closer to sea level than today. After the seas retreated from the Rocky Mountain region, floodplains, swamps, and vast lakes developed in the basins. Drainage systems imposed at that time persist today. Since the Oligocene, episodic epeirogenic uplift gradually raised the entire region, including the Great Plains, to present elevations. Most of the modern topography is the result of Pliocene and Pleistocene events, including additional uplift, glaciation of the high country, and denudation and dissection of older Cenozoic surfaces in the basin by fluvial processes.

In the United States, these distinctive intermontane basins occur principally in the central Rocky Mountains from Colorado and Utah (Uinta Basin) to Montana and are best developed in Wyoming, with the Bighorn, Powder River, and Wind River being the largest. Topographically, the basin floors resemble the surface of the western Great Plains, except for vistas of surrounding mountains.

At most boundaries, Paleozoic through Paleogene units dip steeply into the basins off uplifted blocks cored by Precambrian rocks. The eroded steeply dipping units form hogbacks and flatirons. Many of the boundaries are thrust or reverse faults. Although other boundaries appear to be monoclinal flexures, faulting is suspected at depth. Most bounding faults show evidence of at least two episodes of Laramide (Late Cretaceous and Eocene) movement, suggesting both thrust and strike-slip types of displacement.

==Ecological consequences==
According to paleontologist Thomas M. Lehman, the Laramide orogeny triggered &quot;the most dramatic event that affected Late Cretaceous dinosaur communities in North America prior to their extinction.&quot; This turnover event saw the replacement of specialized and highly ornamented centrosaurine and lambeosaurines by more basal upland dinosaurs in the south, while northern biomes became dominated by &quot;Triceratops&quot; with a greatly reduced hadrosaur community.

<text>Lenny Clarke (born September 16, 1953) is an American comedian and actor. He is known for his thick Boston accent and as the role of Uncle Teddy on the series &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.

==Early life ==
Clarke was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 16, 1953. In his early life, he attended Cambridge Latin High School (CLHS), graduating in 1972. He also attended college at the University of Massachusetts Boston, graduating in 1979. Lenny Clarke was a Cambridge City Council candidate in 1975; he also tried to campaign for mayor.

==Career==
He was the most famous &quot;saloon comic&quot; in Boston during the 1980s, the heyday of the Boston comedy scene. The DVD release &quot;When Standup Stood Out&quot; (2006) details Clarke&#x27;s early career and affiliations with other famous Boston comics, such as Steven Wright and Denis Leary, his good friends. In 1980, Clarke wrote and starred in a local television show &quot;Lenny Clarke&#x27;s Late Show&quot; featuring Wright and Leary, in collaboration with Boston comedy writer Martin Olson. Clarke and Olson were roommates, and their apartment, known by comedians as &quot;The Barracks&quot;, was a notorious &quot;crash pad&quot; for comics visiting Boston, per the film.

Clarke starred in his own short-lived network sitcom &quot;Lenny&quot;, and in such TV shows as &quot;Contest Searchlight&quot;, &quot;The Job&quot;, &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot; and movies like &quot;Monument Ave.&quot;, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; and &quot;Southie&quot;. From 2004 to 2011, Clarke appeared in the recurring role of Uncle Teddy on the FX comedy drama &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.

In 2006, Clarke and Leary appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson&#x27;s anti-semitic comments.

In 2007, Clarke played the role of Ron Abbot on the short lived Fox comedy series &quot;The Winner&quot;. On May 16, 2007, the show was cancelled after six episodes due to low ratings.

Clarke is also an occasional guest on the WEEI radio shows in Boston. It was on this show that he announced he would be a regular on the 2009 Fox sitcom &quot;Brothers&quot; as the racist neighbor who is married to a black woman. He wound up appearing in three episodes before the series was cancelled. In the 2011-12 TV season, he landed a role as the main character&#x27;s father on the NBC mid-season replacement sitcom &quot;Are You There, Chelsea?&quot;.

On the evening of January 19, 2010, Clarke appeared on stage at the victory speech of Republican Senator-elect from Massachusetts Scott Brown, who was elected to the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Ted Kennedy.

He had appeared on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30 - 4 Days in October&quot; alongside ESPN sports and pop culture columnist Bill Simmons as a narrator giving insight on the 2004 ALCS comeback by the Red Sox against the New York Yankees.

<doc id="250962" wikidata="Q332379" url="?curid=250962" title="It's All Relative">
<text>It&#x27;s All Relative is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from October 1, 2003, until April 20, 2004. The series is about two families in Boston – one lower-class Irish Catholic and the other an upper-class WASP household headed by a gay couple – who are reluctantly joined together when their kids get engaged.

== Overview ==
The story revolved around two polar opposite families, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts, that are forced to come together with their kids&#x27; engagement.

In one corner, there was the working-class O&#x27;Neill family, led by Mace (Lenny Clarke), the rather stereotypical Boston Irish bar owner of &quot;Paddy&#x27;s&quot;, with his wife, traditional middle-aged housewife Audrey (Harriet Sansom Harris), and two kids, Bobby (Reid Scott) and Maddy (Paige Moss).

On the other side, there was the upper-class Stoddard-Banks family, with Simon (Christopher Sieber) and Philip (John Benjamin Hickey), a same-sex couple who takes pride in how well they were able to raise their adoptive daughter, Liz (Maggie Lawson).

These two polar opposite families collide when it is revealed Bobby and Liz have been secretly dating each other, and are now engaged. Both sides are against any relationship their child has with the other, let alone a marriage. Homophobic Mace and Stuck-up Philip especially drive the arguments between both of the families, with their very vocal disapproval of not only the engagement, but each other. Bobby and Liz move into Simon and Philip&#x27;s guest house, and the families are now forced to come together – whether they like it or not.

The series follows the relationship between two people from two completely different worlds, and how they make their relationship work. During this process, the two families strove to come to terms with the inevitability of being &quot;joined&quot; by their children&#x27;s union, which would force both sides to revisit their preconceptions and prejudices.

== Production ==
The show was created by Chuck Ranberg and Anne Flett-Giordano. In January 2003, the project received a pilot order at ABC, albeit untitled. Reid Scott was the first cast on March 5, 2003. The next day, Maggie Lawson was cast, shortly following her leading role on the ABC pilot &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;. John Benjamin Hickey was cast on March 21, 2003. On March 31, 2003, Christopher Sieber was cast; Sieber had previously starred in another ABC sitcom &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;. Lenny Clarke was cast on April 9, 2003.

The pilot was picked up by ABC on May 12, 2003, now with the title &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot;. The series premiered on ABC on October 1, 2003. The pilot earned a total of 10.2 million viewers. The series was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 31, 2003.

Despite initial high ratings, and airing between &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; and &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, the series&#x27; ratings soon slid, especially as it had to compete against &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; on Wednesdays. In February 2004, ABC put the series on hiatus, before a move to Tuesdays in March 2004. The rescheduling worsened ratings, now competing against more established and popular series: established Top 50 series &quot;24&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot;, and critical favorites &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. After two episodes in the new timeslot, the series was abruptly pulled from ABC&#x27;s schedule on April 8, 2004, with the final two scheduled episodes left unaired. On May 17, 2004, ABC announced at their annual upfronts that it had cancelled &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot;.

For the 2003–04 television season, the series placed #57 overall, with an average of 8.6 million viewers.

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main ===
* Reid Scott as Bobby O&#x27;Neill:
The son of Mace and Audrey, and Liz&#x27; fiancée. Bobby may not be the brightest or the most hard-working, but he still loves Liz, and is willing to overlook their vast differences to be with her. Bobby works at his family&#x27;s bar. He and Liz met at a Vermont ski resort, after she sprained her ankle on a &quot;bunny slope&quot;, and he took her back to the lodge. When he and Liz announce their engagement, they move into Philip and Simon&#x27;s guest house.
* Maggie Lawson as Liz Stoddard-Banks:
The adoptive daughter of Philip and Simon, and Bobby&#x27;s fiancée. Liz is a smart, outgoing, somewhat-spoiled but well-meaning, Harvard student. Her mother died when Liz was still a baby, and Philip and Simon – her best friends – adopted and raised Liz. Despite being adopted, Liz has much in common with both her dads- she has Philip&#x27;s need for organization and order, but Simon&#x27;s need to relax and have fun (although it usually involves things most would not find fun). Liz met Bobby when she sprained her ankle on a bunny slope at a Vermont skiing lodge. She was raised Episcopalian.
* Lenny Clarke as Mason &quot;Mace&quot; O&#x27;Neill:
Bobby&#x27;s Irish Catholic father and Audrey&#x27;s husband, as well as the owner of the family bar. Mace is a typical Irish Catholic patriarch: he frequently drinks beer, won&#x27;t change his viewpoint or choices for others, and wants his son to marry a Catholic girl. Mace and Philip both disapprove of Bobby and Liz&#x27; relationship, and hate each other as well. Mace will frequently call Philip and Simon various demeaning names, such as &quot;Pixie Sticks&quot; or &quot;The Notorious G.A.Y.&quot;. In the first part of the series, Mace is extremely homophobic; however, these tendencies were suppressed as the show went on (although he does still continue to call them names). When Mace does not get his way, he usually yells &quot;Fine!&quot; and walks away. He is similar to Archie Bunker in all in the family. 
* Harriet Sansom Harris as Audrey O&#x27;Neill (née Corrigan):
Bobby&#x27;s mother and Mace&#x27;s wife, who helps him run the bar. Audrey only wants the best for Bobby and Maddy, and her desires and decisions usually conflict with Mace&#x27;s. Although Audrey is at first on the same page with Mace regarding the Stoddard-Banks family, she eventually warms up to Simon. Later episodes also show Audrey gaining more confidence in herself and her beliefs and desires. She is usually similar to Edith Bunker from All in the family.
* John Benjamin Hickey as Philip Stoddard:
Liz&#x27;s adoptive father, who serves as the patriarch of the Stoddard-Banks family. Philip is portrayed as an effeminate, OCD-ridden art gallery owner. Philip has several phobias and ticks that usually annoy the others (especially Mace and Simon), such as: having different napkins for spills and eating, not allowing Liz and Simon to get dogs due to their &quot;filthiness&quot; (even going as far as lying to both of them for many years about having a terrible allergy), etc. Like Mace disapproves of the relationship between Bobby and Liz, Philip is also the more vocal one of the couple of his disapproval; he is usually saying insults (and sometimes trying) to get Bobby and Liz broken-up. A running gag on the series is Philip&#x27;s three-times divorced mother, Lillian, an overbearing woman who causes both Philip and Simon grief, and is on her fourth marriage to a millionaire in Florida.
* Christopher Sieber as Simon Banks:
Liz&#x27; adoptive father, who serves as the matriarch of the Stoddard-Banks family. Simon is a third-grade teacher, who is portrayed as more masculine than Philip, although he usually takes care of more of the household chores, such as cooking. However, Philip is also very much more laid-back than Philip. Like Audrey, Simon is also on the same page as Philip when Bobby and Liz reveal their engagement; however, he eventually warms up to Audrey. Simon was born and raised in Minnesota, and was in a one-hit 1980&#x27;s boy band called &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; (as &quot;Simon Sez&quot;). A running gag in the series are mentions to Simon&#x27;s &quot;wild&quot; past and string of exes.
* Paige Moss as Maddy O&#x27;Neill:
Bobby&#x27;s younger sister, who is a waitress at the bar. Maddy is a sassy, ditsy, promiscuous gold-digger, who is the most open-minded about Liz and her family (although she does find Liz too boring). Maddy frequently says ignorant comments, such as &quot;Man, daddy, if you would&#x27;ve been gay, my life would have been so much better.&quot; Her dimness is usually made fun of by the other characters, especially Bobby and Mace. Maddy has hooked up with many guys, but is usually only interested in pursuing a relationship with rich men (but only for their money). She was held back in the third grade.

<doc id="250963" wikidata="Q7538358" url="?curid=250963" title="Slab gap hypothesis">
<text>In geology, the slab gap hypothesis is one of the explanations put forward to explain several instances of crustal extension that occur inland near former subduction zones.

Standard plate tectonic theory holds that once a trench is closed by an overriding plate reaching a rift/spreading center, the plate that has just been fully consumed continues to descend beneath the overriding plate for some time, transmitting compressive pressures to the overriding plate above as well as occasional volcanism. Meanwhile, the descending plate leaves behind it a &quot;window&quot; of inactivity. In this view, there is no mantle upwelling, so once the crustal rift is overridden, the only residual effects are from the remnant descending plate slab. However, actual observations of the crust in western North America where the Farallon plate&#x27;s trench and rift was snuffed out millions of years ago by the westward movement of the North American plate, and replaced by the San Andreas Fault, show not compression inland, but extension. This is most evident in the Great Basin where the continental crust and lithosphere as a whole is becoming increasingly thin. The crust here is also warming from below.

The slab gap hypothesis proposes that instead of a &quot;window&quot;, the descending slab leaves behind a &quot;gap&quot; through which the asthenospheric mantle of the former spreading zone continues to act beneath the overriding plate. This hypothesis then assumes that a crustal spreading zone is also underpinned by a corresponding asthenospheric mantle spreading zone or upwelling of warmer material. The gap is created because instead of the old subducted plate continuing to sink, it quickly melts, allowing the asthenospheric upwelling zone to act directly on the underside of the overriding plate, heating it and causing it to spread apart. The fast melt is because the portion of the subducted plate nearest the spreading zone is thin and still warm from its recent creation.

The slab gap hypothesis goes on to state that the upwelling can form very deep cracks, which in turn lets very fluid basalt lava quickly spread over the land surface forming shield volcanoes and vast volcanic plains called &quot;flood basalts&quot;. If, however, the extension is spread over a very large area then these flood basalt events may not occur.

This idea has been used to explain the extension and very large flood basalts that occurred in what is now southern Washington, Oregon and northern California about 17 million years ago (see Columbia River Plateau). Slab gap has also been used to help explain the earlier creation of the Basin and Range Province.

<text>Gardena GmbH, based in Ulm, Germany, is a manufacturer of gardening tools and has been a subsidiary of the Swedish Husqvarna Group since 2007. With an annual sales of 8,343 million Swedish krona (approximately 790 million euros) in 2019, Gardena is the European market leader.

==Company history==
In 1961 the company Kress + Kastner GmbH was founded by the merchants Werner Kress and Eberhard Kastner (1928-2004). Five years later the brand name Gardena was created; the company was renamed Gardena Kress + Kastner GmbH. In 1968 the water hose plug-in system (Original GARDENA System) was introduced. The new, patented plug-in coupling became the basis of a whole system of gardening tools. The advantage of the system is that only the rubber O-rings have to be replaced in the event of leaks. The interchangeable handle connection (GARDENA combisystem) followed eight years later. Both were designed by Dieter Raffler, today Professor Emeritus of Industrial Design. Raffler was responsible for the design of Gardena products for 20 years.

The IPO as Gardena Holding AG took place in 1996, and Wolfgang Jahrreiss was the chairman of the board from 1999 to 2004. Three years later, Gardena was acquired from the founding families by IK Partners (formerly Industri Kapital) through the IK 2000 Fund. In 2003, the Gardena shares were delisted and the company was renamed Gardena AG. One year later, the US subsidiary &quot;Melnor Inc.&quot; was sold and a new chairman of the board, Martin Bertinchamp, was appointed.

In 2007 Industri Kapital sold Gardena to Husqvarna for 730 million euros. The AG was converted back into a GmbH. As part of a restructuring of the group, the various functional areas were further integrated into the global organization of the Husqvarna Group. Since 2015, the Gardena Division has been managed as a largely independent division of the Group.

==Subsidiaries worldwide==
Subsidiaries include Gardena Manufacturing GmbH in Ulm (with three manufacturing sites in Germany), Advanced Plastics s.r.o., Vrbno pod Pradědem (with plants in the Czech Republic), Husqvarna Logistics GmbH (formerly hortus GmbH) and Gardena Deutschland GmbH in Ulm (responsible for sales in Germany). In many other countries Gardena is represented by the respective sales companies of the Husqvarna Group.

<text>James Bartholomew &quot;Jimmy&quot; Olsen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Olsen is most often portrayed as a young photojournalist working for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. He is close friends with Lois Lane and Clark Kent, and has a good working relationship with his boss Perry White. Olsen looks up to his coworkers as role models and parent figures. From 1954 to 1982, Olsen appeared in 222 issues of the comic series &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; and &quot;Superman Family&quot;, in addition to the main Superman titles.

The character has appeared in most other media adaptations of Superman. He was portrayed by Tommy Bond in the two Superman film serials, &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950); Jack Larson in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;; Marc McClure in the &quot;Superman&quot; films of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1984 film &quot;Supergirl&quot;; Michael Landes in the first season of &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and Justin Whalin in the subsequent three seasons; Sam Huntington in the 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;; Aaron Ashmore in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Smallville&quot;; and Michael Cassidy in the 2016 DC Extended Universe film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. In the Arrowverse series &quot;Supergirl&quot;, he was portrayed by Mehcad Brooks. Douglas Smith portrayed the character in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;. He will be portrayed by Skyler Gisondo in &quot;Superman&quot; (2025).

==Publication history==
=== Creation and early appearances===

An unnamed &quot;office boy&quot; with a bow tie appeared in the story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Phony Manager,&quot; published in &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 6 (November 1938); it was retroactively considered to be Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s first appearance. The character was introduced as Jimmy Olsen by producer Bob Maxwell on &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; radio show on April 15, 1940. After eight early unnamed appearances in comics, Olsen first appeared as a named character in a story by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster titled &quot;Superman versus The Archer&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; No. 13 (November–December 1941). He occasionally appeared as an office boy in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; throughout the next decade, and he made a notable appearance as the manager of a community baseball team in the 1946 radio serial Clan of the Fiery Cross. The first long story featuring the character, &quot;King Jimmy Olsen,&quot; ran in the daily Superman newspaper strips from July 20-October 28, 1944.

===&quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;===

Following Jack Larson&#x27;s portrayal on &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series, Olsen was promoted from office boy to &quot;cub reporter&quot; beginning in &quot;Superman&quot; #86. Later in 1954, Olsen received his own series, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;. The first issue introduced the Signal Watch, a high-frequency supersonic device that allowed Jimmy to contact Superman in case of emergency. Lucy Lane debuted as Jimmy&#x27;s off-again, on-again love interest in issue #36. Jimmy and Lucy were occasionally married in &quot;imaginary stories&quot; such as &quot;&quot;&quot;The Wedding of Jimmy Olsen&quot; (issue #38) and &quot;The Amazing Story of Superman Red and Superman Blue!&quot;

==== The Mort Weisinger era ====
Early adventures saw Olsen in a variety of slapstick adventures and strange transformations, such as Jimmy transforming into the giant &quot;Turtle Boy&quot; in issue #53. The stories in the title often featured particularly outlandish situations, ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to Krypton before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with gorillas of all sorts. During this period, Jimmy Olsen lived a glamorous life as &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal&quot; and even had his own (in-story) fan club. Beginning in 1958, Olsen gained the ability to temporarily transform into the superhero Elastic Lad by drinking a serum, becoming an honorary member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. When traveling to the Bottle City of Kandor, Superman and Jimmy donned the secret identities of Nightwing and Flamebird, respectively. He was promoted by editor Perry White to the status of &quot;full-fledged reporter&quot; in issue #124 (October 1969).

&quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; was a best seller throughout the 1960s; at its peak it was the #4 best-selling comic book with an estimated 520,000 copies sold each month. Reprints from the magazine were also featured in &quot;80-Page Giant&quot; #2 and 13 (1964–65).

====Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World====
Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World storyline began in Jimmy Olsen comics in 1970, with issue #134. Kirby began by introducing a secret &quot;D.N.A. Project&quot; to create Mutated Humans for Good, adding &quot;the Hairies&quot; (a group of technology-equipped hippies), superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods), Intergang, Darkseid, and the WGBS media executive Morgan Edge. Kirby also used the series as a vehicle to reintroduce Golden Age characters that he previously created at DC Comics, such as the Guardian and the Newsboy Legion. Before the end of his run, Kirby wrote stories involving vampires, the Loch Ness Monster, Victor Volcanum, a fire-eating archcriminal, as well as a two-part story that featured the comedian Don Rickles. Kirby left the series following issue #148.

=== &quot;The Superman Family&quot; ===
With issue #164 (April–May 1974) the series was renamed &quot;The Superman Family&quot;. An anthology title that incorporated the recently cancelled series &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;, &quot;Superman Family&quot; initially featured one new story about Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, or Supergirl, with the featured character in each issue narrating reprints of the other characters&#x27; stories. By the second series, Jimmy Olsen became an investigative reporter for WGBS-TV nicknamed &quot;Mr. Action,&quot; featuring in urban crime stories that less frequently involved Superman. Olsen appeared in new stories in &quot;The Superman Family&quot; #164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, and 182–222. A number of Superman writers including Leo Dorfman and Cary Bates contributed scripts for the stories, and they were most often pencilled by Kurt Schaffenberger. The series ended with issue #222 (September 1982). Afterwards, Jimmy Olsen continued to appear in issues of &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, and &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;, where a 29th-century descendant of Olsen became Superwoman.

===Post-Crisis===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Jimmy&#x27;s prior history as a character was erased. Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;, and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in the 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman. Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided to trust Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy&#x27;s transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy once became a type of &quot;Elastic Lad&quot; on contact with the Eradicator; this transformation, however, was extremely painful for Jimmy and has not appeared since. He also took the identity of &quot;Turtle Boy&quot; in a series of pizza commercials, made when he was temporarily laid off from the &quot;Planet&quot;.

In the 1990s, Jimmy quit the &quot;Planet&quot; in a dispute over a story and went to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he worked as an on-air investigative reporter. This change matured Jimmy somewhat, but he became more ambitious, as well as more brash and arrogant. He still stayed on good terms with both Clark and Lois to the point where Jimmy was best man at their wedding. This period ended when he believed (wrongly) that he had discovered Superman&#x27;s secret identity and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the time slot. He was again rehired by the &quot;Planet&quot;.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the Alpha Centurion, an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and eyes for Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world&#x27;s finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====&quot;Superman: Metropolis&quot;====
Olsen is a central character in the 12-part miniseries &quot;Superman: Metropolis&quot; (beginning June 2003). Written by Chuck Austen and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focuses on the futuristic technology unleashed in Metropolis by Brainiac in a previous storyline and how it affects the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Jimmy takes a position as a regular star reporter for &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;, replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain at the &quot; Planet&quot;.

====&quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;====

Jimmy&#x27;s story in the 2007–08 weekly series &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; begins with an investigation into the death of Duela Dent. Tying into the &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; storyline, Jimmy starts to develop many superpowers, which he first discovers when he is attacked by Killer Croc while gathering information on Duela&#x27;s death. As the story progresses he tries to uncover the origin of these powers and starts to discover their potential limitlessness in stories which mimic the Silver Age &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; adventures. Briefly operating as the superhero Mr. Action, Jimmy is unable to command the respect of established superheroes in the Justice League and Teen Titans. He gives up on this particular avenue. One of these powers allows Jimmy to realize the identities of some superheroes, such as Robin and Superman, who requests that he take care of Krypto.

Jimmy is eventually tracked down by the New God Forager, with whom he begins a romantic relationship. Forager informs him that Jimmy has become a soulcatcher for the spirits of dying New Gods. The Monitor known as Solomon later tells him that his new powers are the consequence of Darkseid using Jimmy as a host for powers he wishes to use to recreate the universe in his image, knowing that &quot;Superman&#x27;s pal&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s most well-protected citizens. Later, as the events of &quot;Countdown&quot; begin to come to their close, Jimmy becomes a more confidently powerful character and is reunited with the series&#x27; other cast members on a mission to stop Karate Kid&#x27;s disease from becoming a pandemic of apocalyptic proportions. Unfortunately, they fail, and the Morticoccus virus devastates an alternate Earth. Upon return to their Earth, Jimmy is captured by Mary Marvel, who had been manipulated towards evil by Darkseid. When Superman comes to save Jimmy, Darkseid takes control of the powers within him, causing Jimmy to radiate Kryptonite radiation, until Ray Palmer manages to rewire Darkseid&#x27;s control from inside of Jimmy. Jimmy then transforms into a giant turtle-like creature, and prepares to take on Darkseid himself. Darkseid overcomes Jimmy, and prepares to kill him. Ray Palmer then comes out of Jimmy with the New God soul battery, and destroys it, returning Jimmy to normal.

====&quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special&quot;====

During Superman&#x27;s fight with Atlas, Jimmy witnesses a hovering over the fight. After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate.

He tracks down a figure connected with the past of Jonathan Drew and is told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin. His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin, who then tries to kill Jimmy. Jimmy is able to avoid being killed and is apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin&#x27;s telepathy due to his own many physical transformations over the years.

Jimmy goes to Project Cadmus and speaks to Dubbilex, who tells him the story about the death of the original Guardian at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert. Dubbilex then dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin. Jimmy heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ, managing to avoid conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

Upon arriving in Warpath, Jimmy interviews the sheriff, Greg Saunders, who evades his questions. Jimmy follows him after dark and sees Saunders working with the last Guardian clone. He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified from learning that a faction within the U.S. military is actively plotting to kill Superman.

Willing to do anything to uncover the conspiracy behind Project 7734, Jimmy uses an anonymous chat server and gets in contact with Erik/Amazing Woman from Infinity Inc., who claims to have information useful to Jimmy. Despite being actively pursued by Codename: Assassin, who goes so far as to place bugs in his house, Jimmy goes to the appointment, only to find Erik&#x27;s house burned to the ground.

Jimmy pulls Erik out who, with his dying breath, shifts to his more reliable and powerful Erika form. Erik gives him Natasha Irons&#x27; number. Natasha then contacts Jimmy, telling him about the plans of General Sam Lane, his outworldly fortress and his capture, and use of a &quot;Planet Breaker&quot; weapon of Captain Atom, now codenamed &quot;Project Breach&quot; (due to his similarity to Tim Zanetti&#x27;s fate).

Finally ready to uncover the truth, Jimmy is openly confronted by Codename: Assassin, who until that point had merely followed him closely. Jimmy uses his signal watch to call Mon-El. Jimmy is shot twice in the chest by Codename: Assassin and sinks into the ocean. Despite surviving his assassination attempt, Jimmy decides to fake his death, having his documents planted on a heavily disfigured corpse. With no one knowing about his survival, Jimmy moves into the old Pemberton Camera Factory, sharing the results of his now-unhindered investigations with Perry and Mon-El.

====&quot;Action Comics&quot; backup and &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot;====
DC Comics has reported in solicits that Nick Spencer and R. B. Silva will be producing a monthly 10-page backup feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot; chronicling the adventures of Jimmy Olsen in Metropolis. Reported story topics include an alien civilization choosing Metropolis as the base of a major cultural celebration, and the introduction of Chloe Sullivan (from the &quot;Smallville&quot; television series) to the DCU proper. In the latest arc, he goes on a charity date with a girl named Maggie, only to discover that she somehow has ties to Mr. Mxyzptlk, and that she wants to marry him.

The last three chapters of the story are told in the self-titled one-shot &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot;.

=== &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; (vol. 2) ===
Beginning with a cover date of September 2019, DC Comics published a 12-part comedic miniseries that restored some elements of the 1954 series to the main DC Comics timeline. Jimmy was once again shown as Turtle Boy and Elastic Lad, and his antics, glamorous lifestyle as Superman&#x27;s pal, and strange transformations were depicted as a source of streaming-media ad revenue that was keeping the Daily Planet afloat. The series explored Jimmy&#x27;s siblings Janie and Julian, his family&#x27;s historic relations with Lex Luthor&#x27;s family, a plot involving the attempted murder and faked death of Olsen, and a marriage in Gorilla City that Jimmy subsequently forgot to annul. The series poked fun at DC Comics&#x27; own history, including a sequence in which Jimmy angered Batman by suggesting a phone-in campaign to decide whether Robin lived or died. By the end of the series, Jimmy received a new Signal Watch and became the publisher of the Daily Planet.

The series was written by Matt Fraction, drawn by Steve Lieber, colored by Nathan Fairbairn, and lettered by Clayton Cowles. A collected edition titled &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen: Who Killed Jimmy Olsen?&quot; was published in September 2020, and it received an &quot;honorable mention&quot; in Publishers Weekly&#x27;s year-end critics poll.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear. In a 2010 story, he claimed it stopped working some time in the past, never worked particularly well in the first place, and contacted Superman through Morse code now, anyway, but still wore it for show.

Mostly during the Silver Age of Comic Books, Jimmy would find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character – for instance, in &quot;&quot;, Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor&#x27;s bill to outlaw metahumans and in &quot;Countdown&quot;, Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncontrollably, with other stories simply making passing references.

* Speed Demon – In 1956, a month before the debut of Barry Allen as the new Flash, Jimmy drank a potion produced by a Professor Claude and briefly gained super-speed.
* Radioactive – After being exposed to a radioactive substance, Jimmy began to irradiate everything in his presence.
* Super-Brain – Jimmy briefly evolved into a &quot;man of the future&quot; with superhuman mental powers.
* Monstrous beard growth — The machinations of the sinister Beard Band cause Jimmy to grow an immense beard.
* Gorilla – When Jimmy switched minds with a gorilla, he went about his reporting duties as a gorilla in Jimmy&#x27;s clothes.
* Elastic Lad – As Elastic Lad, Jimmy by serum or by alien virus could sometimes stretch himself, akin to the Elongated Man or Plastic Man. As Elastic Lad, Jimmy was inducted as an honorary member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In the Post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity, Jimmy was afflicted with uncontrollable and painful elasticity by the Eradicator.
* Alien-form – Aliens transformed Jimmy into a telepathic Jovian for a week. Fortunately, this turned out to be a Jovian week, which is much shorter than an Earth week, about 70 hours.
* Fire-Breather – An accident involving an experiment gives Jimmy fire-breath.
* Human Octopus – After eating an extraterrestrial fruit, Jimmy grew four extra arms. According to Superman, this was actually a hallucination, but Jimmy suspected that Superman said this to teach him a lesson since Jimmy had foolishly ignored advice from the Man of Steel that would have saved him a lot of trouble.
* Genie – Jimmy found a genie&#x27;s lamp and was tricked into replacing its villainous occupant.
* Wolf-Man – In the vein of the 1957 Michael Landon film &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, Jimmy found himself transformed into a werewolf.
* Woman – Jimmy would occasionally go undercover dressed as a woman in No. 44, No. 67, No. 84, and No. 159. Grant Morrison paid a brief homage to this in the &quot;&quot; graphic novel and in &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;.
* Morbidly Obese – Jimmy tried to get fat in an attempt to stop a jewel smuggling and to impress a circus fat lady.
* Giant Turtle Man – One of Jimmy&#x27;s most frequently cited transformations was that of his turning into a giant turtle man.
* Human Porcupine – After rejecting the romantic advances of an imp from the Fifth Dimension.
* Flamebird – This is the name he took as a costumed superhero, with Superman disguised as Nightwing, in the shrunken Kryptonian city of Kandor. These names were inspired by two native Kryptonian birds, the nightwing and the flamebird, but the relationship between Nightwing and Flamebird intentionally paralleled the crime-fighting team Batman (a night-winged creature) and Robin (a flame-colored bird).
* Bizarro Jimmy – Although Jimmy has a counterpart on Bizarro World, he was briefly turned into a Bizarro himself.
* Hippie – Investigating a colony of hippies at &quot;Guru Kama&#x27;s Dream Pad&quot;, Jimmy grew a beard and participated in a mock &quot;hate-in&quot;. On the cover of this story&#x27;s issue, Jimmy is wielding a sign that says &quot;Superman is a freak-out!&quot;
* Viking – Jimmy put on Viking armor and mistakenly thought he had been transported 1,000 years backward in time.
*Steelman – after a volcanic eruption hurls Jimmy and an experimental inter-dimensional travel device into an alternate universe, Jimmy develops his own superpowers as a result of the transit to the (unnamed) &quot;Earth-X&quot; but is vulnerable to fragments of Mount Tipton from his own universe (&quot;Tiptonite&quot;). He adopts a fusion Superman/Batman outfit and launches his own superhero career as Steelman, facing a Joker-masked Clark Kent, secretly the leader of the LUTHAR League before his return to his own universe of origin.
* Ultra Olsen – Jimmy gained from Professor Lang and his father 2 halves of to the Magic Medallion of the Mayans that, when fused back together, granted him &quot;the Powers of the Mayan Gods&quot;. While he wore it, he possessed super strength, invulnerability, anti-gravity power, and lightning vision.

*Detective Olsen - is a detective Jimmy wanted to solve a case.
*Batman Olsen - is Jimmy wearing Batman&#x27;s suit.

==In other media==
===Radio===
Jimmy Olsen appears in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, voiced initially by Jackie Kelk and subsequently by Jack Grimes.

===Television===

====&quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;====
Jimmy Olsen appears in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, portrayed by Jack Larson. On TV, he lived at 360 Appletree Lane Apartment #3 in Metropolis. This version of the character was largely popular, leading DC Comics to create the series &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;, a regular title with him as the protagonist. Decades later in 1996, Larson portrayed an unnaturally aged Jimmy Olsen in an episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;.

====&quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;====

Jimmy Olsen appears in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, portrayed by Michael Landes in the first season and Justin Whalin for the rest of the series&#x27; run. The reason cited behind the change is that Landes looked too much like Dean Cain as well as to emphasize Jimmy&#x27;s youth. Landes played Olsen as a cocksure, sarcastic Generation X character, who often seemed like he was very sure of himself although usually, the opposite was true. Whalin gave a portrayal closer to previous incarnations of the character, playing Jimmy as a lovably naive rookie. When Whalin took over the role, more emphasis was placed on Jimmy&#x27;s love-life and he would frequently seek out Lois, Clark and Perry&#x27;s advice on these matters. Whalin&#x27;s Olsen was described as being a computer whiz and these talents often came in useful to Lois and Clark/Superman, particularly in the episode &#x27;Virtually Destroyed&#x27; where Jimmy&#x27;s computing abilities come in handy as Lois and Superman battle a villain inside of a virtual reality simulator. Jimmy&#x27;s home life and background is described in some detail throughout the course of the show. Although we never see her, some references are made to Jimmy&#x27;s mother who is described as being overweight and having allergies. Jimmy&#x27;s father Jack Olsen is a James Bond-like secret agent for the fictional National Intelligence Agency (N.I.A.) and the episode &#x27;The Dad who Came in from the Cold&#x27; is entirely devoted to this character.

====&quot;Smallville&quot;====
Jimmy Olsen appears in &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Aaron Ashmore. This version prefers to be called James, is in a relationship with series-original character Chloe Sullivan, and is ultimately killed by the titular villain in the eighth season finale &quot;Doomsday&quot;. Chloe entrusts his camera to his younger brother (portrayed by Ryan Harder). In the ending scene of the series finale set seven years in the future, the adult version of the younger Olsen (also portrayed by Ashmore) appears working with Lois and Clark at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

The 2008 DVD box set for the seventh season of &quot;Smallville&quot; includes a 22-minute featurette, entitled &quot;Jimmy on Jimmy&quot;, which features four of the six surviving actors at the time who had portrayed Jimmy Olsen in live-action: Jack Larson (&quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;), Marc McClure (&quot;Superman&quot; film series, &quot;Supergirl&quot; film), Sam Huntington (&quot;Superman Returns&quot;), and Aaron Ashmore (&quot;Smallville&quot;). Michael Landes and Justin Whalin (both from &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;) did not participate.

====Arrowverse====
Jimmy Olsen appears in TV series set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Mehcad Brooks. Introduced in &quot;Supergirl&quot;, this version is African-American and a former &quot;Daily Planet&quot; photographer who joins CatCo as an art director in the pilot episode. Additionally, he is aware of Superman and Supergirl&#x27;s secret identities and lost his father to criminals when he was a child, leading him to become the vigilante Guardian. Later in the series, Olsen becomes head of CatCo in National City after Cat Grant moves to Metropolis, and quits after Andrea Rojas buys the company and forces him to report on stories based on profitability as opposed to truth. Although his contract forbids him from working at another newspaper after quitting, he finds a loophole by becoming the editor of his hometown paper, &quot;The Calvintown Gazette&quot;, as the contract doesn&#x27;t stop him &quot;owning&quot; another paper.

==== &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; ====
Jimmy Olsen appears in the &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; episode &quot;A Regular Guy&quot;, portrayed by Douglas Smith. This version is the brother of Janet Olsen and headed up the Daily Planet&#x27;s baseball game. His friendship with Clark is semi-strained when he suspected that Clark Kent is Superman which would also explain why he showed up late to the different baseball games. By the present day after Clark revealed in an interview with Janet that he&#x27;s Superman, Jimmy visits Smallville at Janet&#x27;s suggestion and catches up with Clark at the diner Victoria May&#x27;s.

<text>Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (22 November 17101 July 1784) was a German composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was the second child and eldest son of Johann Sebastian Bach and Maria Barbara Bach. Despite his acknowledged genius as an improviser and composer, his income and employment were unstable, and he died in poverty.

== Life ==


Wilhelm Friedemann (hereafter Friedemann) was born in Weimar, where his father was employed as organist and chamber musician to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar. In July 1720, when Friedemann was nine, his mother Maria Barbara Bach died suddenly; Johann Sebastian Bach remarried in December 1721. J. S. Bach supervised Friedemann&#x27;s musical education and career with great attention. The graded course of keyboard studies and composition that J. S. Bach provided is documented in the &quot;Clavier-Büchlein vor Wilhelm Friedemann Bach&quot; (modern spelling: &quot;Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach&quot;), with entries by both father and son. This education also included (parts of) the French Suites, (Two-Part) Inventions, (Three-Part) Sinfonias (popularly known as &quot;Inventions&quot;), the first volume of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, and the six Trio Sonatas for organ. At the age of 16 he went to Merseburg to learn the violin with his teacher Johann Gottlieb Graun.

In addition to his musical training, Friedemann received formal schooling beginning in Weimar. When J. S. Bach took the post of Cantor of the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig (in 1723), he enrolled Friedemann in the associated Thomasschule. (J. S. Bach—who had himself been orphaned at the age of 10—said that he took the position in Leipzig partly because of the educational opportunities it afforded his children). On graduating in 1729, Friedemann enrolled as a law student in Leipzig University, a renowned institution at the time, but later moved on to study law and mathematics at the University of Halle.
He maintained a lifelong interest in mathematics, and continued to study it privately during his first job in Dresden.

Friedemann was appointed in 1733 to the position of organist of the St. Sophia&#x27;s Church at Dresden. In competing for the post he played a new version of his father&#x27;s Prelude and Fugue in G Major, BWV 541. The judge described Friedemann as clearly superior to the other two candidates. He remained a renowned organist throughout his life. Among his many pupils in Dresden was Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, the keyboardist whose name is erroneously enshrined in the popular nickname given to J. S. Bach&#x27;s 1742 publication, &quot;Aria with Diverse Variations&quot;—that is, &quot;The Goldberg Variations.&quot; The scholar Peter Williams has discredited the story which links the work to Goldberg stating that J. S. Bach wrote the work for the Russian Ambassador Count Hermann Carl von Keyserlingk, who would ask his employee, Goldberg, to play the variations to entertain him during sleepless nights. Williams instead has argued that J. S. Bach wrote the variations to provide a display piece for Friedemann.

In 1746 Friedemann became organist of the Liebfrauenkirche at Halle.
In 1751, Friedemann married Dorothea Elisabeth Georgi (1721–1791), who was 11 years his junior and who outlived him by seven years. Dorothea was the daughter of a tax collector. The landed estates she inherited caused the family to be placed in a high tax bracket by Halle authorities, who were raising taxes to meet the revenue demands of the Seven Years&#x27; War. To raise cash for these payments, she sold part of her property in 1770. The couple produced two sons and a daughter, Friederica Sophia (born in 1757), who was the only one of their offspring to live past infancy. The descendants of Friederica Sophia eventually migrated to Oklahoma.

Friedemann was deeply unhappy in Halle almost from the beginning of his tenure. In 1749 he was involved in a conflict with the Cantor of the Liebfrauenkirche, Gottfried Mittag, who had misappropriated funds that were due to Friedemann. In 1750 the church authorities reprimanded Friedemann for overstaying a leave of absence (he was in Leipzig settling his father&#x27;s estate). In 1753 he made his first documented attempt to find another post, and thereafter made several others. All these attempts failed. Bach had at least two pupils, Friedrich Wilhelm Rust and Johann Samuel Petri.

In 1762, he negotiated for the post of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to the court of Darmstadt; although he protracted the negotiations for reasons that are opaque to historians and did not actively take the post, he nevertheless was appointed &quot;Hofkapellmeister of Hessen-Darmstadt,&quot; a title he used in the dedication of his Harpsichord Concerto in E minor.

In June 1764, Friedemann left the job in Halle without any employment secured elsewhere. His financial situation deteriorated so much that in 1768 he re-applied for his old job in Halle, without success. He thereafter supported himself by teaching. After leaving Halle in 1770, he lived for several years (1771–1774) in Braunschweig where he applied in vain for the post of an organist at the St. Catherine&#x27;s church. Then he moved to Berlin, where he initially was welcomed by the princess Anna Amalia (the sister of Frederick the Great). Later, no longer in favor at court, he gave harpsichord lessons to Sarah Levy, the daughter of a prominent Jewish family in Berlin and an avid collector of Bach and other early 18th-century music, who was also a &quot;patron&quot; of Friedemann&#x27;s brother C. P. E. Bach. Friedemann died in Berlin.

Earlier biographers have concluded that his &quot;wayward&quot; and difficult personality reduced his ability to gain and hold secure employment, but the scholar David Schulenberg writes (in the &quot;Oxford Composer Companion: J. S. Bach,&quot; ed. Malcolm Boyd, 1999) that &quot;he may also have been affected by changing social conditions that made it difficult for a self-possessed virtuoso to succeed in a church- or court-related position&quot; (p. 39). Schulenberg adds, &quot;he was evidently less willing than most younger contemporaries to compose fashionable, readily accessible music&quot;.

Friedemann Bach was renowned for his improvisatory skills. It is speculated that when in Leipzig his father&#x27;s accomplishments set so high a bar that he focused on improvisation rather than composition. Evidence adduced for this speculation includes the fact that his compositional output increased in Dresden and Halle.

Friedemann&#x27;s compositions include many church cantatas and instrumental works, of which the most notable are the fugues, polonaises and fantasias for clavier, and the duets for two flutes. He incorporated more elements of the contrapuntal style learned from his father than any of his three composer brothers, but his use of the style has an individualistic and improvisatory edge which endeared his work to musicians of the late 19th century, when there was something of a revival of his reputation.

Friedemann&#x27;s students included Johann Nikolaus Forkel, who in 1802 published the first biography of Johann Sebastian Bach; Friedemann, as well as his younger brother Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, were major informants for Forkel. Friedemann has in earlier biographies been called a poor custodian of his father&#x27;s musical manuscripts, many of which he inherited; however, more recent scholars are uncertain how many were lost. It is known that Friedemann sold some of his father&#x27;s collection to raise cash to pay debts (including a large sale in 1759 to Johann Georg Nacke). Also, his daughter took some of the Sebastian Bach manuscripts with her when she moved to America, and these were passed on to her descendants, who inadvertently destroyed many of them. Others were passed on through his only known Berlin pupil, Sarah Itzig Levy, great-aunt of Felix Mendelssohn. Some of his scores were collected by Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch and his pupil Carl Friedrich Zelter, the teacher of Felix Mendelssohn and through them these materials were placed in the library of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which Fasch founded in 1791 and of which Zelter took charge in 1800.

Friedemann is known occasionally to have claimed credit for music written by his father, but this was in keeping with common musical practices in the era.

=== Use by later composers ===

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s set of six Preludes and Fugues for string trio, K. 404a, contains five fugues transcribed from &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach while the sixth fugue in F minor, is a transcription of one of the Eight Fugues (Falck 31) of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. The preludes in K. 404a are Mozart&#x27;s own, except for 4 (from BWV 527) and 5 (second movement from BWV 526).

=== Film ===

&quot;Friedemann Bach&quot; is a 1941 German historical drama film directed by Traugott Müller and starring Gustaf Gründgens, Leny Marenbach and Johannes Riemann. The film depicts the life of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. It is based on Albert Emil Brachvogel&#x27;s novel &quot;Friedemann Bach&quot;. Wilhelm Friedemann Bach is shown as a gifted son trying to escape his father&#x27;s shadow.

<text>Johann Gottfried Bernhard Bach (11 May 1715 – 27 May 1739) was a German musician. It is not known whether he composed, and his career as an organist is not in itself notable, but his life throws light on his famous father, the composer Johann Sebastian Bach.
Johann Gottfried was the fourth child of Johann Sebastian Bach and Maria Barbara Bach to reach adulthood.

==Early life==
He was born in Weimar, where his father was employed, until 1717 when the family moved to Köthen. His mother died in Köthen in 1720 and his father remarried the following year.

==Education==
In 1723 his father was appointed Thomaskantor in Leipzig. J.S. Bach is believed to have moved to Leipzig partly because of the educational opportunities there for his sons. J.G.B. Bach attended the Thomasschule, where his father was responsible for the musical education which formed an important part of the curriculum. He also studied privately with his father.

==Musical career==
In contrast to his elder brothers Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel he did not get the opportunity to study at Leipzig University after finishing school.
Like his father before him, Johann Gottfried Bernhard auditioned for posts as a musician. He first served as organist at the Marienkirche, the largest church in Mühlhausen in 1735. Johann Sebastian Bach had been employed at Divi Blasii, Mühlhausen&#x27;s other main church. Johann Sebastian was there in 1707–1708, and despite the briefness of his stay he was well regarded by the town council, carrying out commissions for them after moving to Weimar. He was succeeded as organist by one of his cousins.

Johann Gottfried also only spent a short time in the Mühlhausen, moving in 1737 to find a new engagement as organist at the Jakobikirche in Sangerhausen. It was a post for which his father had applied as a young man. However, a new organ by Zacharias Hildebrandt had since been installed.

In 1738, he was burdened with debt and abandoned a career in music in order to study law in Jena. There he died prematurely at age 24.

<doc id="250977" wikidata="Q57225" url="?curid=250977" title="Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach">
<text>Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (21 June 1732 – 26 January 1795) was a German composer and harpsichordist, the fifth son of Johann Sebastian Bach, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Bückeburg Bach&quot;.

Born in Leipzig in the Electorate of Saxony, he was taught music by his father, and also tutored by his distant cousin . He studied at the St. Thomas School, and some believe he studied law at the university there, but there is no record of this. In 1750, William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe appointed Johann Christoph harpsichordist at Bückeburg, and in 1759, he became concertmaster. While there, Bach collaborated with Johann Gottfried Herder, who provided the texts for six vocal works; the music survives for only four of these.

Bach wrote keyboard sonatas, symphonies, oratorios, liturgical choir pieces and motets, operas and songs. Because of Count Wilhelm&#x27;s predilection for Italian music, Bach had to adapt his style accordingly, but he retained stylistic traits of the music of his father and of his brother, C. P. E. Bach.

He married the singer Lucia Elisabeth Münchhausen (1728–1803) in 1755 and the Count stood as godfather to his son Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach. J.C.F. educated his son in music as his own father had, and Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst went on to become music director to Frederick William II of Prussia.

In April 1778 he and Wilhelm travelled to England to visit Johann Christian Bach. J. C. F. Bach died 1795 in Bückeburg, aged 62.

==Assessment==
The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says of him &quot;He was an industrious composer, ... whose work reflects no discredit on the family name.&quot; He was an outstanding virtuoso of the keyboard, with a reasonably wide repertory of surviving works, including twenty symphonies, the later ones influenced by Haydn and Mozart; hardly a genre of vocal music was neglected by him.

A significant portion of J. C. F. Bach&#x27;s output was lost in the WWII destruction of the Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung in Berlin, where the scores had been on deposit since 1917. Musicologists Hansdieter Wohlfahrth, who catalogued his works, and Ulrich Leisinger consider Bach a transitional figure in the mold of his half-brother C. P. E., his brother Johann Christian, the Grauns (Carl and Johann), and Georg Philipp Telemann, with some works in the style of the high Baroque, some in a galant idiom, and still others which combine elements of the two, along with traits of the nascent classical style.

<text>Johann Christian Bach (5 September 1735 – 1 January 1782) was a German composer of the Classical era, the youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach. He received his early musical training from his father, and later from his half-brother, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in Berlin. After his time in Berlin he made his way to Italy to study with famous Padre Martini in Bologna. While in Italy, J.C. Bach was appointed as an organist at the Milan Cathedral. In 1762 he became a composer to the King’s Theatre in London where he wrote a number of successful Italian operas and became known as &quot;The English Bach&quot;. He is responsible for the development of the sinfonia concertante form. He became one of the most influential figures of the classical period, influencing compositional styles of prolific musicians like Haydn and Mozart.

==Life==
Johann Christian Bach was born to Johann Sebastian and Anna Magdalena Bach in 1735 in Leipzig, Germany. His father, Johann Sebastian Bach, instructed him in his early musical training. After his father&#x27;s death, he moved to Berlin to pursue his studies with his half-brother Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, who was twenty-one years his senior and, at the time, was considered to be the most musically gifted of Bach&#x27;s sons.
In 1754 he moved to Italy to study with Padre Martini in Bologna. He was appointed as an organist at Milan Cathedral in 1760. During his time in Italy, he converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism, supposedly due to political reasons. He devoted most of his time composing church music, including music for a Requiem Mass and a Te Deum and Latin Mass settings. His first major work was a Mass, which received an excellent performance and acclaim in 1757. In 1762, Bach travelled to London to première three operas at the King&#x27;s Theatre, including &quot;Orione&quot; on 19 February 1763. In 1764 or 1765, the castrato Giusto Fernando Tenducci, who became a close friend, created the title role in his opera &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot; at King&#x27;s.

That established his reputation in England, and he became music master to Queen Charlotte. In 1766, Bach met soprano Cecilia Grassi (1746-1791), who was eleven years his junior, and married her shortly thereafter. They had no offspring. J. C. Bach performed symphonies and concertos at the Hanover Square Rooms. This was London&#x27;s premier concert venue in the heart of fashionable Mayfair. The surrounding Georgian homes offered a well-to-do clientele for his performances. One of London&#x27;s primary literary circles, which included Jane Timbury, Robert Gunnell Esq., Lord Beauchamp, and the Duchess of Buccleuch, was acquainted with Bach, and members were regular attendees at his events.

In 1777, he won a landmark case, &quot;Bach v Longman&quot;, which established that (in English law) copyright law applied to musical scores. Even before then, Bach demanded a proper credibility for his compositions almost at the same time upon his arrival to London in 1762. He was granted an exclusive right to publish his music for 14 years.

By the late 1770s, both his popularity and finances were in decline. By the time of Bach&#x27;s death on New Year&#x27;s Day 1782, he had become so indebted (in part due to his steward embezzling his money), that Queen Charlotte stepped in to cover the expenses of the estate and provided a life pension for Bach&#x27;s widow. He was buried in the graveyard of St. Pancras Old Church, London.

==Works==

The works of J. C. Bach are given &#x27;W&#x27; numbers, from Ernest Warburton&#x27;s Thematic catalog of his works (New York City: Garland Publishing, 1999). Bach&#x27;s compositions include eleven operas, as well as chamber music, orchestral music and compositions for keyboard.

==Legacy==

In the fourth volume of Charles Burney&#x27;s &quot;General History of Music&quot; there is an account of J. C. Bach&#x27;s career.

There are two others named Johann Christian Bach in the Bach family tree, but neither was a composer.

In 1764, Bach met with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was aged eight at the time and was in London during the Mozart family grand tour. Bach then spent five months teaching Mozart in composition. Bach is widely regarded as having a strong influence on the young Mozart, with scholars such as Téodor de Wyzewa and Georges de Saint-Foix describing him as &quot;The only true teacher of Mozart&quot;. Mozart arranged three sonatas from Bach&#x27;s Op. 5 into keyboard concertos, and in later life Mozart &quot;often acknowledged the artistic debt he owed&quot; to Johann Christian. Upon hearing of Bach&#x27;s death in 1782, Mozart commented, &quot;What a loss to the musical world!&quot;

J.C. Bach had an immense influence on Mozart. In fact, Mozart’s partiality to wind instruments in his early symphonies were influenced by Bach. As J.C. Bach believed that wind instruments should be carriers of their own melodic material and not just act as doubled instruments, Mozart followed suit. J.C. Bach’s influence on Mozart was so grand that the theme of the slow movement of Mozart’s Concerto K414 contains a reference to the overture of Bach’s opera, &quot;La calamita de cuori&quot;.

J.C. Bach is responsible for the development of a distinct Classical musical form known as Sinfonia concertante. This genre emerged as a musical form from the Baroque concerto grosso. Sinfonia concertante influenced many of Bach’s contemporaries, like Mozart and Haydn, and provided a framework for further compositions.

The Bach-Abel concerts were a series of public concerts that eventually gave way to the development of modern day concert series. The concerts where created in collaboration with his friend and German virtuoso viola da gamba player, Carl Friedrich Abel. These concerts first started at Abel&#x27;s residence but an increase in popularity led to these concerts being held at larger venues. They featured new works, by Bach and Abel, but also newer musical artists, such as Haydn, giving them a platform to feature their works on a public stage. Because these concerts required a subscription, they cultivated a regular audience as the audience members prepaid for that season&#x27;s concert series. Furthermore, the Bach-Abel concerts allowed the middle class greater access to live classical music. Previously, live music performances were limited to private, aristocratic settings; however, these subscription concerts were made available to the wider public, allowing middle class people to engage in the arts and society. The Bach-Abel concerts decreased in popularity and ended due to changing musical tastes and Bach&#x27;s death.

<text>Prince Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly (baptised – ) was a Russian field marshal who figured prominently in the Napoleonic Wars.

Barclay was born into a Baltic German family from Livland. His father was the first of his family to be accepted into the Russian nobility. Barclay joined the Imperial Russian Army at a young age in 1776. He served with distinction in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), and the Kościuszko Uprising (1794).

In 1806, Barclay began commanding in the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Pułtusk that same year. He was wounded at the Battle of Eylau in 1807 while his troops were covering the retreat of the Russian army. Because of his wounds, he was forced to leave command. The following year, he carried out successful operations in the Finnish War against Sweden. Barclay led a large number of Russian troops approximately 100 km across the frozen Gulf of Bothnia in winter during a snowstorm. For his accomplishments, Barclay de Tolly was appointed Governor-General of the Grand Duchy of Finland. From 20 January 1810 to September 1812 he was the Minister of War of the Russian Empire.

When the French invasion of Russia began in 1812, Barclay de Tolly was commander of the 1st Army of the West, the largest Army to face Napoleon. Barclay initiated a scorched earth policy from the beginning of the campaign, though this made him unpopular among Russians. After the Battle of Smolensk failed to halt the French and discontent among Russians continued to grow, Alexander I appointed Mikhail Kutuzov as Commander-in-Chief, though Barclay remained in charge of the 1st Army. However, Kutuzov continued the same scorched earth retreat up to Moscow where the Battle of Borodino took place nearby. Barclay commanded the right wing and center of the Russian army for the battle. After Napoleon&#x27;s retreat, the eventual success of Barclay&#x27;s tactics made him a hero among Russians. He became Commander-in-Chief in 1813 after the battle of Bautzen, replacing Wittgenstein (who had been appointed after Kutuzov&#x27;s death early in 1813) and led the taking of Paris, for which he was made a Field Marshal. His health later declined and he died on a visit to Germany in 1818.

== Early life and family ==
Michael Andreas was born to Gotthard Barclay de Tolly (1734–1781) and his wife Margarethe Elisabeth von Smitten (1733-1771). The Barclay de Tolly family were German-speaking descendants of the Scottish Clan Barclay. Their ancestor, Peter Barclay, belonged to the Towie or Tolly branch of the family and settled in Rostock in 1621; his son later moved to Riga in Livonia. Michael Andreas was born in in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and raised in Beckhof, Livonia, which was his mother&#x27;s family estate. The commonly accepted birth date of 27 December 1761 is actually the day of his baptism in the Lutheran church of the town of Zaumel.

Michael Andreas&#x27;s grandfather, Wilhelm Barclay de Tolly, served as the mayor of Riga, while his father served in the Russian army before being admitted into the ranks of the Russian nobility by the Tsar. From 1765, the young Barclay de Tolly grew up in St. Petersburg and was raised by his aunt. This was a common occurrence among the German Protestants, and it gave the young man an exposure to higher society unavailable in the Baltic provinces.

The future field marshal started his active service in the Imperial Russian Army in 1776, and he would spend the rest of his life with the military. He had two brothers who also served in the Russian army: Axel Heinrich Barclay de Tolly, a Major General of Engineers, and Erich Johann Barclay de Tolly, a Major of Artillery.

== Service history ==

Barclay was enlisted in the Pskov Carabineer Regiment on 13 May 1776, and he achieved the rank of a cornet by May 1778. In the same year, he joined the Imperial jaeger regiments, and with his unit was assigned to the army of Prince Potemkin. In 1788–1789, during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), Barclay served under the command of Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym. During this campaign, he distinguished himself in the taking of Ochakov and Akkerman. For his role in the capture of Ochakov, he was personally decorated by Prince Potemkin.

In 1789, during the Russo-Swedish War, he was transferred to the Finnish front. Four years later, he fought in the Polish Campaign of 1794, and was decorated for his role in the capture of Vilnius. He was a lieutenant colonel by 1794 after serving as aide-de-camp to various senior officers in several campaigns. In that year, he was appointed commander of the Estland Jaeger Corps, and three years later commander of the 4th Jaeger Regiment, becoming its chief in 1799, soon after being promoted to general major for his service in Poland.

In the war of 1806 against Napoleon, Barclay took a distinguished part in the Battle of Pultusk (December 1806) and was wounded at the Battle of Eylau (7 February 1807), where his conduct won him promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. After a period of convalescence, Barclay returned to the army and in 1808 commanded operations against the Swedes during the Finnish War. In 1809, he successfully marched over the frozen Gulf of Bothnia, which allowed him to surprise the enemy and seize Umeå in Sweden. For this exploit, immortalized by the Russian poet Baratynsky, he was made full general and Governor-General of Finland. A year later, he became Minister of War, retaining the post until 1813.

== Napoleon&#x27;s invasion ==

During Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, Barclay assumed the supreme command of the 1st Army of the West, the largest of the Russian armies facing Napoleon. He used a strategy of retreat leaving behind scorched earth from the beginning of the campaign in order to draw the French supply lines deep into Russian territory and retreated to the village of Tsaryovo-Zaimishche between Moscow and Smolensk, although some consider the strategy merely a confluence of diverse circumstances and not attributable to the will of one man.

Nevertheless, the Russians keenly opposed the appointment of a non-Russian as commander-in-chief. His rivals spread rumors of his being Napoleon&#x27;s agent, and the populace condemned him as a coward. Barclay was forced by his subordinates and the Tsar to engage Napoleon at Smolensk (17–18 August 1812). Napoleon forced Barclay to retreat when he threatened Barclay&#x27;s only escape route. After the loss of the &quot;Holy City&quot; of Smolensk, the outcry of officers and civilians grew to a point where the Tsar could no longer ignore it. He appointed Kutuzov, previously a general at the battle of Austerlitz, as the over-all commander of the Russian forces. Barclay remained General of the 1st Army of the West.

Barclay commanded the right flank at the Battle of Borodino (7 September 1812) with great valour and presence of mind, and during the celebrated council at Fili advised Kutuzov to surrender unfortified Moscow to the enemy. His illness made itself known at that time and he was forced to leave the army soon afterwards.

After Napoleon was driven from Russia, the eventual success of Barclay&#x27;s tactics made him a romantic hero, misunderstood by his contemporaries and rejected by the court. His popularity soared, and his honour was restored by the tsar.

== Conquest of France ==

Barclay was re-employed in the field and took part in the German Campaign of 1813 and the French Campaign of 1814, which ended the War of the Sixth Coalition (1812–1814).

After Kutuzov&#x27;s death, he once again became commander-in-chief of the Russian forces at the Battle of Bautzen (21 May 1813), and in this capacity he served at Dresden (26–27 August 1813), Kulm (29–30 August 1813) and Leipzig (16–19 October 1813). In the latter battle, he commanded a central part of the Allied forces so effectively that the tsar bestowed upon him the title of count. 

Barclay took part in the invasion of France in 1814 and commanded the taking of Paris, receiving the baton of a Field Marshal in reward. In 1815 he again served as commander-in-chief of the Russian army, which after the Hundred Days occupied France, and he was made a prince at the close of the war. As his health grew worse, he left the military and settled down in his Jõgeveste manor (German exonym: &quot;Beckhof&quot;, Polish: &quot;Tepelshof&quot;) (in what is now southern Estonia).

==Legacy==
Barclay de Tolly died at Insterburg (Chernyakhovsk), East Prussia, on 26 May 1818 (14 May, Old Style) on his way from his Livonian manor to Germany, where he wanted to renew his health. His and his wife Helene Auguste Eleonore von Smitten&#x27;s remains were embalmed and put into the mausoleum built to a design by Apollon Shchedrin and Vasily Demut-Malinovsky in 1832 in Jõgeveste.
A grand statue of him was erected in front of Kazan Cathedral, St Petersburg at the behest of Emperor Nicholas I. A full-size bronze-mounted statue by Vladimir Surovtsev in Chernyakhovsk, a bust monument in Tartu, and the so-called &quot;Barclay&#x27;s leaning house&quot; in Tartu (which was acquired by his widow after his death). He was also commemorated by a modern statue in Riga, until it was subsequently dismantled on 16 October 2024.

==Personal life and family==
In 1791, Michael married his cousin, Auguste Helena Eleonora von Smitten (1770–1828), daughter of Hinrich Johann von Smitten (1731–1782) and Renata Helena von Stackelberg (1749–1786). After the extinction of the Barclay de Tolly princely line with his son Magnus on 29 October 1871 (17 October, Old Style), Alexander II allowed the field marshal&#x27;s sister&#x27;s grandson through female lineage, Alexander von Weymarn, to assume the title of Prince Barclay de Tolly-Weymarn on 12 June 1872 (31 May, Old Style).

== Commemoration ==

* The Nesvizhskiy 4th Grenadier regiment (the General-Field Marshal Prince Barklay-de-Tolli, Mikhail Bogdanovich&#x27;s) was named for the Prince in 1880s.
* He was also the namesake of a short-lived Russian fortress in the Hawaiian Islands.
* A statue of Barclay de Tolly was erected in 2001 in the Esplanade gardens in Riga, evoking an earlier 1913 monument that was melted down for military use during World War I.
* Whereas his lineage as a Baltic-Scottish Baron (and as such: Non-Russian) had caused him to be derided by Russian historians in the late 19th and throughout the 20th century in favor of Kutuzov, his image as a leader has undergone a positive reassessment in recent years.
* The main-belt asteroid 4524 Barklajdetolli, discovered by Lyudmila Zhuravleva in 1981, was named in his honor.
* In the West Siberian river shipping company MRF RSFSR (Barnaul) operated steam tug Barclay.
* &quot;Barclay de Tolly&quot; was the name given in 1820 to Raroia island in the Tuamotus, French Polynesia.

In 2013, JSC Aeroflot-Russian Airlines received the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft manufactured by the Boeing Corporation, named in honor of the outstanding Russian military leader - M. Barclay de Tolly.

<doc id="250982" wikidata="Q1355905" url="?curid=250982" title="2000 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 2000 Canadian federal election was held on November 27, 2000, to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 37th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal Party won a third majority government.

Since the previous election of 1997, small-c conservatives had begun attempts to merge the Reform Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada as part of the United Alternative agenda. During that time, Jean Charest stepped down as leader of the Progressive Conservatives and former Prime Minister Joe Clark took over the party and opposed any union with the Reform Party. In the spring of 2000, the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance, a political party dedicated to uniting conservatives together into one party. Former Reform Party leader Preston Manning lost in a leadership race to Stockwell Day who became leader of the new Canadian Alliance party.

The federal government called an early election after being in office for close to three and a half years (with a maximum allowed mandate of five years). The governing Liberal Party of Canada won a third consecutive majority government, winning more seats than in 1997. The Canadian Alliance only made minor gains, and an Eastern breakthrough did not happen. The Bloc Québécois, New Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservatives all suffered slight losses.

This was the most recent election as of in which an incumbent government successfully defended its parliamentary majority. It was also the last election in which a single party won more than 40% of the popular vote, although the Conservative Party under Stephen Harper in 2011 (39.62%) and the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau in 2015 (39.47%) would both come close. This was the only election contested by the Canadian Alliance and the last by the Progressive Conservatives (as they both merged into the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003). This was also the first election in which Nunavut was its own separate territory (before, it was part of the Northwest Territories).

==Changes to constituency names==

The following name changes took effect for the 2000 election:

== Campaign ==
On October 22, 2000, Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to dissolve parliament and call an election scheduled for November 27, 2000. This move has been viewed by commentators as an attempt to stem a possible rise of support to the newly formed Canadian Alliance, to stop the leadership ambitions of Paul Martin, and to capitalize on the nostalgia created by the recent death of Pierre Trudeau. At the time of the election, the Canadian economy was strong and there were few immediate negative issues, as the opposition parties were not prepared for the campaign.

The major issue in the election was health care which had risen in public opinion polls to be the most important issue for Canadians.

The public was largely uninterested in the election, with commentators stating that voters expected a repeat of previous regionally divided elections that offered little chance of a change of government.

The Liberals&#x27; final television advertisement, according to Stephen Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;The Big Red Machine&quot;, &quot;emphasized the contrast between [the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance] while warning voters about [PC leader] Joe Clark&#x27;s claim that he would form a coalition with the Bloc Québécois in a minority government. The ad told Canadians not to take risks with other parties but to choose a strong, proven team&quot;.

== Political parties ==

=== Liberal Party ===

The Liberal Party entered the election with a record of ending the budgetary deficit, making major reductions in federal spending (such as by cuts to the civil service, privatization of crown corporations), creating new environmental regulations, and increasing spending beginning on social programs beginning in 1998 after the budget deficit had ended and a surplus had been achieved. The Liberal Party came under attack by opposition parties for irregularities in the Department of Human Resources&#x27; Transition Job Fund program, but Chrétien managed to capably defend the government&#x27;s actions. Chrétien was directly attacked by the opposition parties for alleged corrupt involvement from the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO) in providing funding to local projects in Chrétien&#x27;s riding of Saint-Maurice. The Liberal Party focused its attacks on the Canadian Alliance, accusing it of being a dangerous right-wing movement that was a threat to national unity. The Liberal Party&#x27;s most tense problem was the ongoing leadership feud within the Liberal Party between Chrétien and Finance Minister Paul Martin who wanted to replace Chrétien as Liberal leader and Prime Minister.

==== Strategy ====
Due to the regionalized nature of previous elections, the Liberal Party designed its election strategy along regional lines, aiming to take every seat in Ontario, winning seats in Quebec from the Bloc Québécois, and winning seats in Atlantic Canada, while attempting to minimize losses in Western Canada to the Canadian Alliance.

Chrétien only spent parts of nine days campaigning in the West, including only two stops in the province of Alberta, both in the city of Edmonton while visiting the province of British Columbia only three times, and only in the cities of Victoria and Vancouver.

The Liberal Party focused its effort in regaining support in Atlantic Canada, where the party had suffered serious losses in the 1997 election to the New Democratic Party and Progressive Conservative Party due to the Liberal government&#x27;s imposition of quotas on Atlantic Canadian cod fisheries and the government&#x27;s cuts to unemployment insurance benefits. Chrétien gained support during the campaign from former New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna and former Chrétien government minister and then the current Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Tobin resigned as Premier and ran as a Liberal Party candidate in his province. During the campaign, Chrétien apologized to Atlantic Canadians for the negative impact of employment insurance reforms which had caused hardship in Atlantic Canada.

In Quebec, the Liberal Party benefited from the collapse of support for the Progressive Conservative Party, after the PCs&#x27; popular Québécois leader Jean Charest had resigned in 1998 and was replaced by former Prime Minister Joe Clark who was unpopular in Quebec which resulted in three PC members from Quebec defecting to join the Liberal Party prior to the election. In Quebec the recently passed Clarity Act by the federal government was controversial in that it demanded a clear and concise question on a new referendum on sovereignty. Chrétien defended the Clarity Act and attacked sovereigntist Quebec premier and former Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard, challenging him to hold another referendum on sovereignty under the new laws, as Chrétien expected that the sovereigntists would lose such a referendum. The Liberal Party promised a number of government projects in Quebec to woo Quebec voters to the Liberal Party.

The Liberal Party appealed to Canada&#x27;s most populous province of Ontario by acting to restore funding that its government had cut in the 1990s in order to cut the deficit of the 1990s. The Liberal government established a health accord with all premiers in September 2000 that involved major projected increases to public health care spending. Overall, the Liberals increased their number of seats in the House of Commons from 155 seats to 172 seats. They also won the popular vote in their former stronghold of Quebec for the first time since 1980, though they narrowly fell short of winning the most seats in the province, winning 36 seats to the Bloc&#x27;s 38.

=== Canadian Alliance ===
The Canadian Alliance (the common short form name of Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance) was a new political party in the election, having been created only months earlier as the successor to the Reform Party of Canada, a party founded as a Western Canada protest party which sought to become a national party in the 1990s. Reform Party leader Preston Manning was deeply disappointed with the Reform Party&#x27;s failure to spread eastward in the 1997 election, as the Reform Party lost its only seat in Ontario in that election. Reform identified vote-splitting with its rival conservative movement, the Progressive Conservative Party as the cause for the Liberals&#x27; 1997 election victory, and Manning proposed the solution of a merger of the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties. This agenda by the Reform Party to unite the two parties was called the United Alternative which began in 1998, and ultimately resulted in the Alliance.

The new party subsequently elected Stockwell Day as leader over Manning. The Alliance had hoped to use the 2000 election to eclipse the PC party in Ontario and Eastern Canada. The Alliance dedicated its campaign to demonstrating that the party was a national party and not as western-based as its predecessor had been perceived as. Day&#x27;s more media friendly and &quot;easy going&quot; persona was expected to appeal to more Ontario voters than Manning&#x27;s reputation as a , and after the United Alternative project had integrated the successful Provincial PCs in the party, the Canadian Alliance was hoping for major improvements.

The Alliance campaigned on: cutting taxes by reducing the Federal taxation rate to two lower tax brackets, an end to the federal gun registration program, and importance of family values. The campaign was dogged by accusations: introducing a two-tier health care—the party would allow private health care to exist alongside the public medicare system; and for threatening the protection of gay rights and abortion rights. The latter accusations tended to focus on the party&#x27;s residual direct democracy provisions in their platform. The accusations against his party platform, along with Day&#x27;s relative inexperience compared to decades-experienced fixtures like Clark and Chrétien, led to the party fading from contention.

While they did not force the Liberals into minority government or finally eclipse the PC party, they did retain their official opposition status, and increased their numbers in the House of Commons by six seats, from 60 to 66. The Alliance ended up winning only two Ontario ridings. On election night, controversy arose when a CBC producer&#x27;s gratuitously sexist comment about Stockwell Day&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Juliana Thiessen-Day, was accidentally broadcast on the Canadian networks&#x27; pooled election feed from Day&#x27;s riding.

=== Bloc Québécois ===

The Bloc Québécois suffered from the unpopular decision of its provincial counterpart, the ruling Parti Québécois government&#x27;s agenda to merge the communities surrounding Quebec City into one community. Many Québécois were angered by this decision and voted in protest against the Bloc or chose not to vote at all to demonstrate their frustration. Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe received negative media attention after he decided to personally appoint candidate Noël Tremblay to run in the riding of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord in spite of the Bloc&#x27;s riding association&#x27;s selection of Sylvain Gaudreault to run in the riding. The Bloc&#x27;s 177 page platform was criticized as being far too large, and few copies were distributed and few internet users accessed the platform because of its length and it was rarely discussed during the campaign. Instead, the Bloc produced large numbers of copies of small booklets that outlined the policies within the large platform. The Bloc campaigned to try to win over previous supporters of the PC Party. This campaign strategy failed, as the Bloc lost seats to the Liberal Party due to the collapse of Quebec support for the Progressive Conservative Party, whose voters shifted to the Liberal Party. The Bloc won in 38 ridings, six ridings fewer than in the 1997 election.

=== New Democratic Party ===

The New Democratic Party suffered badly in the campaign due to the drop in support for the provincial New Democratic parties over the preceding decade and amid a scandal in 2000 facing British Columbia&#x27;s NDP Premier Glen Clark who was forced to resign as Premier. Matters were made worse for the federal NDP after Saskatchewan&#x27;s NDP Premier Roy Romanow resigned in 2000 after the party lost seats in the 1999 Saskatchewan provincial election, and afterwards suggested that the federal NDP should merge with the Liberal Party. In Nova Scotia, the provincial NDP lost seats in its 1999 election while the NDP government of the Yukon had been recently defeated. As Canada&#x27;s major social democratic political party, it relied on support from the labour movement, but recent strains between the NDP and the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Canadian Labour Congress had weakened the party&#x27;s base of support. The party had received little media attention during the election and 2000 as a whole, due to the media&#x27;s focus on Canada&#x27;s newest political party, the Canadian Alliance, the political comeback of former Prime Minister Joe Clark to the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party, and the leadership feud within the Liberal Party between Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin. The NDP did not expect to do well in the election and aimed to win thirty-two &quot;must-win&quot; seats.

The NDP&#x27;s platform and campaign focused on protecting medicare while attacking the Liberal Party for its tax cuts to wealthy Canadians and corporations. The NDP&#x27;s focus on attacking the Liberals failed to recognize the surging support for the Canadian Alliance in the province of Saskatchewan, where the NDP had hoped to gain seats. The NDP failed to galvanize support, as it remained low in support in polling results throughout most of the election campaign. NDP leader Alexa McDonough performed badly in the French-language debate due to her not being fluent in French. In the English-language debate, McDonough attacked Alliance leader Stockwell Day for favouring two-tier health care and attacked Liberal leader Jean Chrétien for giving out tax cuts to the wealthy rather than funding Canada&#x27;s public health care system.

=== Progressive Conservative Party ===

The Progressive Conservative Party aimed to regain its former place in Canadian politics under the leadership of former Prime Minister Joe Clark. The PC Party had a very disappointing election, recording its lowest ever share of the national vote, falling from 20 to 12 seats, and being almost exclusively confined to the Maritime provinces. It won the 12 seats needed for Official party status in the House of Commons, however.

<doc id="250984" wikidata="Q3150308" url="?curid=250984" title="Divergent boundary">
<text>In plate tectonics, a divergent boundary or divergent plate boundary (also known as a constructive boundary or an extensional boundary) is a linear feature that exists between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other. Divergent boundaries within continents initially produce rifts, which eventually become rift valleys. Most active divergent plate boundaries occur between oceanic plates and exist as mid-oceanic ridges.

Current research indicates that complex convection within the Earth&#x27;s mantle allows material to rise to the base of the lithosphere beneath each divergent plate boundary.
This supplies the area with huge amounts of heat and a reduction in pressure that melts rock from the asthenosphere (or upper mantle) beneath the rift area, forming large flood basalt or lava flows. Each eruption occurs in only a part of the plate boundary at any one time, but when it does occur, it fills in the opening gap as the two opposing plates move away from each other.

Over millions of years, tectonic plates may move many hundreds of kilometers away from both sides of a divergent plate boundary. Because of this, rocks closest to a boundary are younger than rocks further away on the same plate.

== Description ==

At divergent boundaries, two plates move away from each other and the space that this creates is filled with new crustal material sourced from molten magma that forms below. The origin of new divergent boundaries at triple junctions is sometimes thought to be associated with the phenomenon known as hotspots. Here, exceedingly large convective cells bring very large quantities of hot asthenospheric material near the surface, and the kinetic energy is thought to be sufficient to break apart the lithosphere.

Divergent boundaries are typified in the oceanic lithosphere by the rifts of the oceanic ridge system, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, and in the continental lithosphere by rift valleys such as the famous East African Great Rift Valley. Divergent boundaries can create massive fault zones in the oceanic ridge system. Spreading is generally not uniform, so where spreading rates of adjacent ridge blocks are different, massive transform faults occur. These are the fracture zones, many bearing names, that are a major source of submarine earthquakes. A seafloor map will show a rather strange pattern of blocky structures that are separated by linear features perpendicular to the ridge axis. If one views the seafloor between the fracture zones as conveyor belts carrying the ridge on each side of the rift away from the spreading center the action becomes clear. Crest depths of the old ridges, parallel to the current spreading center, will be older and deeper... (from thermal contraction and subsidence).

It is at mid-ocean ridges that one of the key pieces of evidence forcing acceptance of the seafloor spreading hypothesis was found. Airborne geomagnetic surveys showed a strange pattern of symmetrical magnetic reversals on opposite sides of ridge centers. The pattern was far too regular to be coincidental as the widths of the opposing bands were too closely matched. Scientists had been studying polar reversals and the link was made by Lawrence W. Morley, Frederick John Vine and Drummond Hoyle Matthews in the Morley–Vine–Matthews hypothesis. The magnetic banding directly corresponds with the Earth&#x27;s polar reversals. This was confirmed by measuring the ages of the rocks within each band. The banding furnishes a map in time and space of both spreading rate and polar reversals.

<doc id="250986" wikidata="Q3637636" url="?curid=250986" title="Belili">
<text>Belili was a Mesopotamian goddess. This name refers both to a sister of Dumuzi known from some of the texts pertaining to his death, and to a primordial deity paired with Alala and listed in enumerations of ancestors of Anu. There is no consensus among researchers if they should be considered one and the same.

==Name==
Belili&#x27;s name has no plausible etymology in Sumerian or any Semitic language, and based on its structure it has been compared to other divine names whose origin also remains a mystery, such as Alala, Aruru, Bunene and Zababa. Belili is also attested as an ordinary given name, one of the so-called banana names known from both Mesopotamia and Elam. Names with this structure are particularly common in the earliest Akkadian documents from Gasur (later known as Nuzi). It has been proposed that such names, both divine and ordinary, originate in a substrate language (so-called &quot;proto-Euphratic&quot;), but this conclusion is not universally accepted, and Gonzalo Rubio points out that they might simply represent a naming pattern among speakers of Akkadian. Manfred Krebernik suggests that they were a type of hypocorism (pet name).

The proposal that the theonym Belili was a contracted or corrupted form of the epithet Belet-ili is regarded as baseless today.

==Character==
Belili appears in two distinct roles in Mesopotamian texts, as a sister of Dumuzi and as a primordial deity counted among the ancestors of Anu. Andrew R. George and Wilfred G. Lambert consider the sister of Dumuzi and the ancestor of Anu to be the same goddess. However, according to Manfred Krebernik, it is uncertain if Belili the sister of Dumuzi and Belili the primordial deity were related in any way.

===Sister of Dumuzi===
An explicit reference to the Belili as Dumuzi&#x27;s sister is only present in the myth &quot;Ishtar&#x27;s Descent&quot;, though they appear together in other texts as well. Other deities considered to be Dumuzi&#x27;s relatives were Geshtinanna, well attested as his sister, and their mother Duttur. Belili is described as a mourner in the incantation series &quot;Šurpu&quot;, which might be a reference to her relation to Dumuzi.

It has been argued that similar to Belet-Seri, Belili was understood as the Akkadian counterpart of Geshtinanna. However, Manfred Krebernik considers Belili and Gesthinanna to be two independent goddesses each of whom could be described as Dumuzi&#x27;s sister. Furthermore, both of them appear in separate roles in the myth &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

===Primordial deity===
In lists of the sky god Anu&#x27;s ancestors, Belili was typically paired with Alala, and together they occupy the final place in multiple documents enumerating such deities. This most likely indicates they could be regarded as Anu&#x27;s parents. In the incantation series &quot;Udug Hul&quot; they appear in an enumeration of primeval deities: &quot;Dūri, Dāri; Laḫmu, Laḫamu; Engur, Ningarra; Alāla; Bēlili.&quot; A single god list (K 4349) equates them with each other. According to Andrew R. George, this pair is also present in an unpublished hymn dedicated to the city of Borsippa. However, they were not associated with each other in other contexts, and according to Wilfred G. Lambert it is possible that they only came to be regarded as a couple because of both of their names being iterative.

==Worship==
Belili was commonly worshiped alongside Dumuzi. E-Arali (Sumerian: &quot;house, netherworld&quot;), a well known shrine dedicated to this god located in his cult center Bad-tibira, also occurs as a location dedicated to Belili in the &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot;. Another temple dedicated to both of them was the E-erra (Sumerian: &quot;house of lament&quot;), though its location is unknown.

A temple dedicated to Belili, the Ekadimma, was located in Babylon. In a single administrative text it is paired with a sparsely attested temple of Shara for unknown reasons. Andrew R. George used its absence from the &quot;Canonical temple List&quot; to estimate the date of this document&#x27;s composition as the second half of the Kassite period, since it postdates the foundation of Dur-Kurigalzu, but makes no mention of temples commonly listed in sources from Babylonia and Assyria from the late second and first millennium BCE, postdating the fall of the Kassite dynasty. Belili was also worshiped in Esagil complex, in this case sharing a cultic seat with Alala.

Some temples dedicated to Belili alone are also known from the &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot;, but their locations are unknown. They include the E-TIN-na, possibly to be read as Ekurunna, &quot;house of liquor,&quot; and the Euruku, &quot;house, pure city.&quot;

==Mythology==
Belili is attested in a number of literary texts dealing with the death of Dumuzi. In &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Dumuzi wants to hide in her house while being chased by demons. Belili agrees and offers him water, but later she has to leave, which lets the pursuers enter her house and take Dumuzi to the underworld. She is described as an old woman. Geshtinanna appears in the same myth in a different role. In &quot;Ishtar&#x27;s Descent&quot;, a late Akkadian reinterpretation of an earlier Sumerian myth, Belili listens to the laments heard when Dumuzi dies and has to enter the underworld. The term used to describe these sounds is &quot;ikkillu&quot;, &quot;an inarticulate cry expressing suffering of high intensity.&quot;

&quot;In the Desert by the Early Grass&quot;, a collection of laments dedicated to temporarily dying gods mourned by their respective mothers or sisters, mentions Belili alongside Amashilama, Ninazimua, Geshtinanna and three deities whose names are not preserved.

<text>The Unix file system (UFS) is a family of file systems supported by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is a distant descendant of the original filesystem used by Version 7 Unix.

== Design ==

A UFS volume is composed of the following parts:

* A few blocks at the beginning of the partition reserved for boot blocks (which must be initialized separately from the filesystem)
* A superblock, containing a magic number identifying this as a UFS filesystem, and some other vital numbers describing this filesystem&#x27;s geometry and statistics and behavioral tuning parameters
* A collection of cylinder groups. Each cylinder group has the following components:
** A backup copy of the superblock
** A cylinder group header, with statistics, free lists, etc., about this cylinder group, similar to those in the superblock
** A number of inodes, each containing file attributes
** A number of data blocks

Inodes are numbered sequentially, starting at 0. Inode 0 is reserved for unallocated directory entries, inode 1 was the inode of the bad block file in historical UNIX versions, followed by the inode for the root directory, which is always inode 2 and the inode for the lost+found directory which is inode 3.

Directory files contain only the list of filenames in the directory and the inode associated with each file. All file metadata is kept in the inode.

== History and evolution ==

Early Unix filesystems were referred to simply as &quot;FS&quot;. FS only included the boot block, superblock, a clump of inodes, and the data blocks. This worked well for the small disks early Unixes were designed for, but as technology advanced and disks grew larger, moving the head back and forth between the clump of inodes and the data blocks they referred to caused thrashing. Marshall Kirk McKusick, then a Berkeley graduate student, optimized the V7 FS layout to create BSD 4.2&#x27;s FFS (Fast File System) by inventing cylinder groups, which break the disk up into smaller chunks, with each group having its own inodes and data blocks.

The intent of BSD FFS is to try to localize associated data blocks and metadata in the same cylinder group and, ideally, all of the contents of a directory (both data and metadata for all the files) in the same or nearby cylinder group, thus reducing fragmentation caused by scattering a directory&#x27;s contents over a whole disk.

Some of the performance parameters in the superblock included number of tracks and sectors, disk rotation speed, head speed, and alignment of the sectors between tracks. In a fully optimized system, the head could be moved between close tracks to read scattered sectors from alternating tracks while waiting for the platter to spin around.

As disks grew larger and larger, sector-level optimization became obsolete (especially with disks that used linear sector numbering and variable sectors per track). With larger disks and larger files, fragmented reads became more of a problem. To combat this, BSD originally increased the filesystem block size from one sector to 1 K in 4.0 BSD; and, in FFS, increased the filesystem block size from 1 K to 8 K. This has several effects. The chance of a file&#x27;s sectors being contiguous is much greater. The amount of overhead to list the file&#x27;s blocks is reduced, while the number of bytes representable by any given number of blocks is increased.

Larger disk sizes are also possible, since the maximum number of blocks is limited by a fixed bit-width block number. However, with larger block sizes, disks with many small files will waste space, since each file must occupy at least one block. Because of this, BSD added &quot;block-level fragmentation&quot;, also called block suballocation, tail merging, or tail packing, where the last partial block of data from several files may be stored in a single &quot;fragment&quot; block instead of multiple mostly empty blocks.

The work on Berkeley FFS was widely adopted by other Unix vendors, and the family of filesystems derived from it are collectively known as UFS.

== Implementations ==

Vendors of some proprietary Unix systems, such as SunOS / Solaris, System V Release 4, HP-UX, and Tru64 UNIX, and open Unix derived systems like illumos, have adopted UFS. Most of them adapted UFS to their own uses, adding proprietary extensions that may not be recognized by other vendors&#x27; versions of Unix. Many have continued to use the original block size and data field widths as the original UFS, so some degree of read compatibility remains across platforms. Compatibility between implementations as a whole is spotty at best.

As of Solaris 7, Sun Microsystems included UFS Logging, which brought filesystem journaling to UFS, which is still available in current versions of Solaris and illumos. Solaris UFS also has extensions for large files and large disks and other features.

In 4.4BSD and BSD Unix systems derived from it, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFlyBSD, the implementation of UFS1 and UFS2 is split into two layers: an upper layer that provides the directory structure and supports metadata (permissions, ownership, etc.) in the inode structure, and lower layers that provide data containers implemented as inodes. This was done to support both the traditional FFS and the LFS log-structured file system with shared code for common functions. The upper layer is called &quot;UFS&quot;, and the lower layers are called &quot;FFS&quot; and &quot;LFS&quot;. In some of those systems, the term &quot;FFS&quot; is used for the combination of the FFS lower layer and the UFS upper layer, and the term &quot;LFS&quot; is used for the combination of the LFS lower layer and the UFS upper layer.

Kirk McKusick implemented block reallocation, a technique that reorders the blocks in the file system just before the writes are done to reduce fragmentation and control file system aging. He also implemented soft updates, a mechanism that maintains the file system consistency without limiting the performance in the way the traditional sync mode did. This has the side effect of reducing the requirement of file system checking after a crash or power failure. To overcome the remaining issues after a failure, a background fsck utility was introduced.

In UFS2, Kirk McKusick and Poul-Henning Kamp extended the FreeBSD FFS and UFS layers to add 64-bit block pointers (allowing volumes to grow up to 8 zebibytes), variable-sized blocks (similar to extents), extended flag fields, additional &#x27;birthtime&#x27; stamps, extended attribute support and POSIX1.e ACLs. UFS2 became the supported UFS version starting with FreeBSD 5.0. FreeBSD also introduced soft updates and the ability to make file system snapshots for both UFS1 and UFS2. These have since been ported to NetBSD, but eventually soft updates (called soft dependencies in NetBSD) was removed from NetBSD 6.0 in favor of the less complex file system journaling mechanism called WAPBL (also referred as logging), which was added to FFS in NetBSD 5.0. OpenBSD supported soft updates from version 2.9 until support was dropped in version 7.4, and it has had UFS2 (FFS2) support (no ACLs) since version 4.2. OpenBSD has now made UFS2 the default UFS version and will be included with the 6.7 release. Since FreeBSD 7.0, UFS also supports filesystem journaling using the gjournal GEOM provider. FreeBSD 9.0 adds support for lightweight journaling on top of soft updates (SU+J), which greatly reduces the need for background fsck, and NFSv4 ACLs.

FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD also include the Dirhash system, developed by Ian Dowse. This system maintains an in-memory hash table to speed up directory lookups. Dirhash alleviates a number of performance problems associated with large directories in UFS.

Linux includes a UFS implementation for binary compatibility at the read level with other Unixes, but since there is no standard implementation for the vendor extensions to UFS, Linux does not have full support for writing to UFS. The native Linux ext2 filesystem was inspired by UFS1 but does not support fragments and there are no plans to implement soft updates. (In some 4.4BSD-derived systems, the UFS layer can use an ext2 layer as a container layer, just as it can use FFS and LFS.)

NeXTStep, which was BSD-derived, also used a version of UFS. In Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X, it was available as an alternative to HFS+, their proprietary filesystem. However, as of Mac OS X Leopard, it was no longer possible to install Mac OS X on a UFS-formatted volume. In addition, one cannot upgrade older versions of Mac OS X installed on UFS-formatted volumes to Leopard; upgrading requires reformatting the startup volume. There was a 4 GB file limit for disks formatted as UFS in Mac OS X. As of Mac OS X Lion, UFS support was completely dropped.

<text>Punk in Drublic is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on July 19, 1994, through Epitaph Records. The title is a spoonerism of &quot;Drunk in Public&quot;.

&quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; is NOFX&#x27;s most successful album to date, peaking at number 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers chart. The album has received positive reviews and is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike. Six years after its release, it became the band&#x27;s only gold record for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. Worldwide, the record has sold over 1 million copies.

==Reception and legacy==

The AllMusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated: &quot;The quartet didn&#x27;t change their approach at all — at their core, they remain a heavy, speed-addled, hook-conscious post-hardcore punk group — but their songwriting has improved, as has their attack.&quot;

===Accolades===


The album was a big influence on Blink-182&#x27;s &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; (1995), Unwritten Law&#x27;s &quot;Oz Factor&quot; (1996), Lagwagon&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Feelings&quot; (1998), Sum 41&#x27;s &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; (2001) and Anti-Flag&#x27;s &quot;The General Strike&quot; (2012).

==Album notes==
* The song &quot;Jeff Wears Birkenstocks&quot; was written about Jeff Abarta, an Epitaph Records employee. In 2017, the Birkenstock company produced a short-form documentary about how the song came together that includes new interviews on the subject with Jeff and Fat Mike.
* &quot;Linoleum&quot; is referenced in the Pilot episode of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, when protagonist Lucas Scott notices a NOFX sticker on one of Peyton Sawyer&#x27;s folders, he sings the line &quot;that&#x27;s me inside your head.&quot;
* Track 17 contains a hidden track starting at 5:29, after three minutes of silence; guitarist El Hefe performs impressions of cartoon characters, such as Yosemite Sam and Popeye.
* &quot;Linoleum&quot; is also covered by hardcore-punk band Shai Hulud, Russell and the Wolf Choir, post-third wave ska band Streetlight Manifesto on their 2010 album &quot;99 Songs of Revolution&quot;, Bad Astronaut, August Burns Red and Frank Turner

<text>Folklorama is an event that runs for two weeks each August in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Visitors to the festival are invited to sample cuisine and celebrate the cultural and ethnic heritage of people from dozens of cultures who have made Winnipeg their home. Folklorama is the world&#x27;s largest and longest-running multicultural festival.

Each culture has an assigned venue, known as a pavilion. Typically there are over 40 pavilions presented throughout the city, with half operating in week one and half in week two of the festival. Each pavilion presents a show featuring the song and dance of their culture, along with trademark ethnic cuisine and a cultural display. Some pavilions also incorporate additional services such as henna tattoo application, steel pan drum workshops, and some have late night parties. Most pavilions provide imported cultural beverage.

Folklorama provides exposure to cultural groups and brings in thousands of tourists each year, adding to the city&#x27;s economy. It is the largest and longest-running festival of its kind in the world. The Folk Arts Council of Winnipeg is the organizing body of Folklorama.

==History==
Folklorama was first held in August 1970, as a Centennial Folk Festival sponsored jointly by the City of Winnipeg and the Folk Arts Council of Manitoba. It was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence in celebration of Manitoba&#x27;s centennial. It was deemed such a success that it became an annual event. The first festival was only a week long, featuring 21 different cultures. The Indian, Greek, Portuguese, Ukraine, and the Africa/Caribbean Pavilions were one of the festival&#x27;s original six pavilions; it drew approximately 50,000 people across 75,000 separate pavilion visits. The festival adopted its current two-week format in 1988, with half of the pavilions open in each week.

The Folklorama logo was designed by Andy Stout who won the provincial logo contest in 1980. The 4 figures in the logo represent people from the four corners of the globe, who are intertwined, with arms raised in celebration. The festival&#x27;s mascot, the Folklorama Llama, was created in 1986.

Until 1989, pavilions would have a mayor and a queen. The queen would be in the running for the Miss Folklorama pageant at the closing ceremony of the Festival. The Miss Folklorama pageant was not a beauty pageant but a &quot;contest of ethnic preservation and presentation&quot;, as the pavilion queens were scored based on 40% knowledge of culture and country, 40% on participation and 20% on poise and personality. Since 1990, pavilions now feature two adult ambassadors and two youth ambassadors, neither of whom must be of a specific gender.

The 50th edition of the Folklorama festival was in 2019. There were 22 pavilions in the first week including: African, Argentina &quot;Tango&quot;, Budapest-Hungaria, Caribbean, Celtic Ireland, Chile, Egyptian, El Salvador, Ethiopian, First Nations, German, Greek, India, Israel &quot;Shalom Square&quot;, Korean, España-Spain, Portugal, Scandinavian, Serbian/Beograd, Slovenija, Ukraine &quot;Spirt of the Ukraine&quot;, and the United Kingdom. There were 23 pavilions in the second week, including: Africa/Caribbean, Brazilian, Canadien-Français, Chilean, Chinese, Croatian &quot;Zagreb&quot;, Hungary-Pannonia, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Métis, Mexican, Scotland, Philippines &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Casa do Minho&quot;, Polish, Punjab, Romanian, Russian, Serbian &quot;Kolo&quot;, South Sudanese, Tamil, and Ukraine-Kyiv.

Folklorama was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but resumed in 2022 with 24 pavilions and a 14% increase in attendance over 2019. In 2023, the number of pavilions offered increased to 40. 

==Program areas==
Throughout the year, Folklorama is sustained by its Ethno-Cultural Arts Division and programs: Folklorama at Home, Folklorama at School, Folklorama at Work, and Folklorama at Play.
==Statistics==
* On average, Folklorama receives approximately 400,000 pavilion visits each year. The 2022 Festival received 168,516 pavilion visits to 24 pavilions. The majority of those who attend the Festival visit more than one pavilion.
* About 21% of pavilion visitors come from outside of Winnipeg.
* Typically, more than 3,000 entertainers perform at more than 1,500 shows throughout the two-week Festival.
* On average, 600,000 meals are served and 1,000,000 beverages are poured before the conclusion of the Festival.
* Approximately 20,000 volunteers participate to make Folklorama possible.
* Folklorama has an economic impact of about $14.7 million on the Manitoba economy.

<doc id="251000" wikidata="Q185801" url="?curid=251000" title="Mikhail Kutuzov">
<text>Prince Mikhail Illarionovich Golenishchev-Kutuzov-Smolensky (; – ) was a Field Marshal of the Russian Empire. He served as a military officer and a diplomat under the reign of three Romanov monarchs: Empress Catherine II, and Emperors Paul I and Alexander I. Kutuzov was shot in the head twice while fighting the Turks (1774 and 1788) and survived the serious injuries seemingly against all odds. He defeated Napoleon as commander-in-chief using attrition warfare in the Patriotic war of 1812. Alexander I, the incumbent Tsar during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion, would write that he would be remembered amongst Europe&#x27;s most famous commanders and that Russia would never forget his worthiness.

== Early career ==
=== Youth ===
Mikhail Kutuzov was born in Saint Petersburg on 16 September 1745. His father, Lieutenant-General (1717–1784), had served for 30 years with the Corps of Engineers, had seen action against the Turks and served under Peter the Great. His mother was Anna Illarionovna Beklemisheva (b. 1728), whose family was also part of the Russian nobility. Given his father&#x27;s distinguished service and his mother&#x27;s high birth, Kutuzov had contact with the imperial Romanov family from an early age.

In 1757, at the age of 12, Kutuzov entered an elite military-engineering school as a cadet private. He quickly became popular with his peers and teachers alike, proving himself to be highly intelligent, and showed bravery in his school&#x27;s numerous horse-races. Kutuzov studied military and civil subjects there, learned to speak French, German and English fluently, and later studied Polish, Swedish, and Turkish; his linguistic skills served him well throughout his career. In October 1759, he became a corporal. In 1760, he became a mathematics instructor at the school.

In 1762, Kutuzov, by then a captain, became part of the Astrakhan Infantry Regiment, which was commanded by Colonel Alexander Suvorov. Kutuzov studied Suvorov&#x27;s style of command and learned how to be a good commander in battle. Suvorov believed that an effective order should be simple, direct, and concise, and that a commander should care deeply about the health and training of his soldiers. Kutuzov also adopted Suvorov&#x27;s conviction that a commander should lead his troops from the front (instead of from the rear) to provide an example of bravery for the troops to follow. Suvorov also taught Kutuzov the importance of developing close relationships with those under his command. Kutuzov followed this advice to the benefit of his career. This advice contributed to Kutuzov&#x27;s appointment as Commander-in-Chief in 1812.

Late in 1762, Kutuzov became aide-de-camp to the military governor of Reval, the Prince of Holstein-Beck, in which role he showed himself to be a capable politician. In 1768 Kutuzov fought in Poland, after the Polish szlachta—the Polish noble class—rebelled against Russian influence. In this conflict, Kutuzov captured several strong defensive positions, thereby proving his skill on the battlefield.

=== First Russo-Turkish war (1768–1774) and beyond ===

In October 1768, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Russian Empress Catherine the Great. Two years later, Kutuzov, now a major, joined the army of the soon-to-be-famous Count Pyotr Rumyantsev in the south to fight against the Turks. Though Kutuzov served valiantly in this campaign, he did not receive any medals, as another officer reported to Rumyantsev that Kutuzov mocked Rumyantsev behind his back. Rumyantsev had Lieutenant-Colonel Kutuzov transferred into Prince Vasily Dolgorukov-Krymsky&#x27;s Russian Second Army fighting the Turks and the Tatars in the Crimea. During this campaign Kutuzov learned how to use the deadly Cossack light cavalry, another skill which would prove useful in the defence of Russia against Napoleon&#x27;s invading armies in 1812. In 1774 he was ordered to storm the well-defended town of Alushta on the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula. When his troops&#x27; advance faltered, Kutuzov grabbed the fallen regimental standard and led the attack. While charging forward, he was shot in the left temple—an almost certainly fatal wound at the time. The bullet went right through his head and exited near the right eye. However, Kutuzov slowly recovered, though frequently overcome by sharp pains and dizziness, and his right eye remained permanently twisted. He left the army later that year due to his wound.

Kutuzov&#x27;s pain did not subside, and so he decided to travel to Western Europe for better medical care. He arrived in Berlin in 1774, where he spent much time with King Frederick the Great of Prussia, who took great interest in Kutuzov. They spent long periods of time discussing tactics, weaponry, and uniforms. Kutuzov then travelled to Leyden, Holland and to London in England for further treatment. In London Kutuzov first learned of the American Revolutionary War. He would later study the evolution of American general George Washington&#x27;s attrition campaign against the British. The American experience reinforced the lesson that Rumyantsev had already taught Kutuzov; that one does not need to win battles in order to win a war.

Kutuzov returned to the Russian Army in 1776 and again served under Suvorov—in the Crimea—for the next six years. He learned that letting the common soldier use his natural intellect and initiative made for a more effective army. Suvorov also taught him how to use mobility in order to exploit the constantly changing situation on the battlefield. By 1782 Kutuzov had been promoted to brigadier general as Suvorov recognised Kutuzov&#x27;s potential as a shrewd and intelligent leader. Indeed, Suvorov wrote that he would not even have to tell Kutuzov what needed to be done in order for him to carry out his objective. In 1788 Kutuzov was again wounded in the left temple, in almost exactly the same place as before, and again doctors feared for his life. However, Kutuzov recovered, though his right eye was even more twisted than before and he had even worse head-pains.

=== Second Russo-Turkish war (1787–1792) and beyond ===

In 1784 he became a major general, in 1787 governor-general of the Crimea; and under Suvorov, whose disciple he became, he won considerable distinction in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), at the taking of Ochakov, Odessa, Bender, and Izmail, and in the battles of Rymnik (1789) and Mashin (July 1791). He became a lieutenant-general (March 1791) and successively occupied the positions of ambassador at Istanbul, commander of Russian forces in Finland, commandant of the corps of cadets at Saint Petersburg, ambassador at Berlin, and governor-general of Saint Petersburg (1801–1802).

Kutuzov was a favourite of Tsar Paul I (reigned 1796–1801), and after that emperor&#x27;s murder he was temporarily out of favour with the new monarch Alexander I, though he remained loyal.

== Napoleonic Wars ==
=== Austerlitz ===

In 1805, Kutuzov commanded the Russian corps to oppose Napoleon&#x27;s advance on Vienna, but the Austrians were quickly defeated at Ulm in mid-October before they could meet up with their Russian allies.

Kutuzov was present at the battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. On the eve of battle, Kutuzov tried to convince the Allied generals of the necessity of waiting for reinforcements before facing Napoleon. Alexander believed that waiting to engage Napoleon&#x27;s forces would be seen as cowardly. Kutuzov quickly realised that he no longer had any power with Alexander and the Austrian chief of staff General-Major Franz von Weyrother. When he asked Alexander where he planned to move a unit of troops, he was told &quot;That&#x27;s none of your business.&quot; Though Alexander&#x27;s orders made it clear that the Russians should move off the strategic Pratzen Plateau, Kutuzov stalled for as long as possible as he recognised the advantage that Napoleon would gain from this high ground. Finally, Alexander forced Kutuzov to abandon the Plateau. Napoleon quickly seized the ridge and broke the Allied lines with his artillery which now commanded the battlefield from the Pratzen Plateau. The battle was lost, and over 25,000 Russians were killed. Kutuzov was put in charge of organising the army&#x27;s retreat across Hungary and back into Russia as Alexander was overcome by grief.

=== Third Russo-Turkish war ===

Kutuzov was then put in charge of the Russian army operating against the Turks in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812. Understanding that his armies would be badly needed in the upcoming war with the French, he hastily brought the prolonged war to a victorious end (Battle of Slobozia), concluded the favourable Treaty of Bucharest, which stipulated the incorporation of Bessarabia into the Russian Empire, and earned the title of &quot;graf&quot; (1811).

== The Patriotic War (1812) ==


===Appointment as supreme commander===

When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly (then Minister of War), with his army being outnumbered 2:1, chose to follow the scorched earth principle and retreat rather than to risk a major battle. His strategy aroused grudges among most of the generals and soldiers. As Alexander after the Battle of Smolensk had to choose a new general, there was only one choice: Kutuzov. He was popular among the troops mainly because he was Russian (most of the generals commanding Russian troops at that time were foreign), he was brave, had proven himself in battle, strongly believed in the Russian Orthodox Church, and he looked out for the troops&#x27; well-being. The nobles and clergy also regarded Kutuzov highly. Therefore, when Kutuzov was appointed commander-in-chief on the 17th and joined the army on 29 August 1812 at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche, Russians supported his appointment. Only Alexander, repulsed by Kutuzov&#x27;s physique and irrationally holding him responsible for the defeat at Austerlitz, did not celebrate Kutuzov&#x27;s commission. The day before he left he met with Madame de Stael, a strong opponent of Napoleon.

===Borodino===

Within a week Kutuzov decided to give major battle on the approaches to Moscow. He withdrew the troops still further to the east, deploying them for the upcoming battle. Two huge armies clashed near Borodino on 7 September 1812, involving nearly a quarter of a million soldiers, with a ratio about 1.1 French soldiers to 1 Russian soldier. The result of the battle of Borodino was a kind of pyrrhic victory for Napoleon, with near a third of the French army killed or wounded. Although the Russian losses were nearly 50% higher, the Russian army had not been destroyed.

On 10 September the main quarter of the Russian army was situated at Bolshiye Vyazyomy. Kutuzov settled in a manor on the high road to Moscow. The owner was Dmitry Golitsyn, who entered military service again. The next day Tsar Alexander signed a document that Kutuzov was promoted General Field Marshal, the highest military rank. Russian sources suggest Kutuzov wrote a number of orders and letters to Rostopchin, the Moscow military governor, about saving the city or the army. On , the main forces of Kutuzov departed from the village, now Golitsyno and camped near Odintsovo, 20 km to the west, followed by Mortier and Joachim Murat&#x27;s vanguard. On Sunday afternoon the Russian military council at Fili discussed the risks and agreed to abandon Moscow without fighting.

=== Further events ===

This came at the price of losing Moscow, whose population was evacuated. After a council at the village of Fili, Kutuzov withdrew to the rich southeast of Moscow. On 19 September Murat lost sight of Kutuzov who changed direction and turned west to Podolsk and Tarutino where he would be more protected by the surrounding hills and the Nara river. On 3 October Kutuzov and his entire staff arrived at Tarutino. He wanted to go even further in order to control the three-pronged roads from Obninsk to Kaluga and Medyn, so that Napoleon could not turn south or southwest. Kutuzov avoided frontal battles involving large masses of troops in order to reinforce his Russian army and to wait there for Napoleon&#x27;s retreat. This tactic was sharply criticised by Chief of Staff Bennigsen and others, but also by the Autocrat and Emperor Alexander (Barclay de Tolly interrupted his service for five months and settled in Nizhny Novgorod). Each side avoided the other and seemed no longer to wish to get into a fight. On 5 October, on order of Napoleon, the French ambassador Jacques Lauriston left Moscow to meet Kutuzov at his headquarters near Tarutino. Kutuzov agreed to meet, despite the orders of the Tsar. On 18 October, at dawn during breakfast, Murat&#x27;s camp in a forest was surprised by an attack by forces led by Bennigsen, known as Battle of Winkovo. Bennigsen was supported by Kutuzov from his headquarters at distance. Bennigsen asked Kutuzov to provide troops for the pursuit. However, the General Field Marshal refused. Napoleon&#x27;s goal was to get around Kutuzov, but on the 24th he was stopped at Maloyaroslavets on his way to Medyn and forced to go north on the 26th.

After the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, fought with a 1:1 ratio of French and Russian soldiers, Napoleon decided to avoid a decisive battle and marched north via Mozhaisk to Smolensk into a higher probability of starvation, as it was the devastated route of his advance. The old general &quot;escorted&quot; Napoleon on the more southern roads but attacked him at the Battle of Vyazma, at the Battle of Krasnoi, fought with a ratio of 1 French soldier to 1.4 Russian soldiers, and at the Battle of Berezina, fought with a ratio of 1 French soldier to 1.75 Russian soldiers. In parallel Cossack bands and peasants assaulted isolated French units during their whole retreat. With Kutusov&#x27;s strategy of attrition warfare, on 14 December the remainder of the French main army left Russia. The only remaining troops were the flanking forces (43,000 under Schwarzenberg, 23,000 under Macdonald), about 1,000 men of the Guard and about 40,000 stragglers. About 110,000 soldiers were all that were left of the 612,000 (including reinforcements) that had entered Russia.

Alexander I awarded Kutuzov the victory title of &quot;His Serene Highness Knyaz Golenischev-Kutuzov-Smolensky&quot; (Светлейший князь Голенищев-Кутузов-Смоленский, pre-1918: Свѣтлѣйшій князь Голенищевъ​-​Кутузовъ​-Смоленскій; &quot;Smolensky&quot; means &quot;of Smolensk&quot;) on , for his victory at the Battle of Krasnoi at Smolensk in November 1812.

== Death and legacy ==
Early in 1813, Kutuzov fell ill, and he died on 28 April 1813 at Bunzlau, Silesia, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now Bolesławiec, Poland. Memorials have been erected to him there, at the Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow and in front of the Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, where he is buried, by Boris Orlovsky. He had five daughters with his spouse Princess Catherine Ilytchina Kutuzova née Bibikova (1754–1824); his only son Nicolay died of smallpox as an infant. As he had no male heir, his estates passed to the Tolstoy family, as his eldest daughter, Princess Praskovya Kutuzova (1777–1844), had married Count Matvei Fyodorovich Tolstoy (1772–1815).

Today, Kutuzov is still held in high regard, alongside Barclay and his mentor Suvorov.

Alexander Pushkin addressed the Field Marshal in the famous elegy on Kutuzov&#x27;s sepulchre. The novelist Leo Tolstoy clearly idolised Kutuzov. In his influential 1869 novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;, the elderly, sick Kutuzov plays a major role in the war sections. He is portrayed as a gentle spiritual man, far removed from the cold arrogance of Napoleon, but with a much clearer vision of the true nature of warfare. Tolstoy wrote of Kutuzov&#x27;s insight and the national sentiment, &quot;... this sentiment elevated Kutuzov to the high pinnacle of humanity from which he, the general-in-chief, employed all his efforts, not to kill and exterminate men, but to save and have pity on them.&quot;

During World War II (known as &quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot; in Russia), the Soviet government established the Order of Kutuzov which, among several other decorations, was preserved in Russia upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, thus remaining among the highest military awards in Russia, only second to the Order of Soviet Marshall Zhukov.

Also, during World War II, one of the key strategic operations of the Red Army, the Orel Strategic Offensive Operation &quot;Kutuzov&quot; was named after the Field Marshal () (12 July – 18 August 1943).
No less than ten Russian towns have been named &quot;Kutuzovo&quot; during the Soviet era in honour of the general. Notable among them is the former German town of Schirwindt (now Kutuzovo in the Krasnoznamensky District of the Kaliningrad Oblast) – the first town in Germany proper that was reached by Soviet infantry in 1945. One of the largest prospekts of Moscow, Kutuzovsky Prospekt, bears Kutuzov&#x27;s name since 1952.

A &quot;Sverdlov&quot;-class cruiser named for Kutuzov was commissioned in the Soviet Navy in 1954. It is now preserved, thanks to the efforts of Evgeny Primakov, as a museum ship in Novorossiysk. From May 1813 to 2020, at least 24 ships were identified in United Kingdom, United States, Russian Empire, Soviet Union and Russia, named after Kutuzov.

The monument to Kutuzov in the city of Brody in Western Ukraine was demolished in February 2014 as part of the Euromaidan demonstrations. Due to decommunization policies (although Kutuzov is not related to communism, his image was used by the Soviets for propaganda purposes) the street named after Kutuzov in (Ukraine&#x27;s capital) Kyiv was renamed after and a lane dedicated to his legacy was renamed after Yevhen Hutsalo (both) in 2016.

Aeroflot named one of its planes after Kutuzov.

<text>Elizabeth Moon (born March 7, 1945) is an American science fiction and fantasy writer. Her other writing includes newspaper columns and opinion pieces. Her novel &quot;The Speed of Dark&quot; won the 2003 Nebula Award. Prior to her writing career, she served in the United States Marine Corps.

==Early life==
Moon was born Susan Elizabeth Norris and grew up in McAllen, Texas. She started writing when she was a child and first tried a book, which was about her dog, at age six. She was inspired to write creatively, and says that she began writing science fiction in her teens, considering it a sideline.

She earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in History from Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1968 and later earned a second B.A. in Biology. In 1968, she joined the United States Marine Corps as a computer specialist, attaining the rank of 1st Lieutenant while on active duty. She married Richard Sloan Moon in 1969 and they have a son, Michael, born in 1983.

==Writing career==
Moon began writing professionally in her mid-thirties and had a newspaper column in a county weekly newspaper. In 1986, she published her first science fiction in the monthly magazine &quot;Analog&quot; and the anthology series &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot;. Her stories appeared regularly in &quot;Analog&quot; the next few years. Her first novel &quot;The Sheepfarmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1988) won the Compton Crook Award and inaugurated the Paksenarrion series.

Most of her work has military science fiction themes, although biology, politics, and personal relationships also feature strongly. &quot;The Serrano Legacy&quot; is a space opera. Her Nebula-winning novel &quot;The Speed of Dark&quot; (2003) is a near-future story told from the viewpoint of an autistic data analyst, inspired by her own autistic son Michael.

==Other interests==
Elizabeth Moon has many interests besides writing. She has a musical background, having played the accordion during her university days and sung in choirs. She is an accomplished fencer, and captain of the SFWA Musketeers, a group of published speculative fiction authors who also fence.

Moon is also an experienced paramedic and has served in various capacities in local government.

<doc id="251002" wikidata="Q2936047" url="?curid=251002" title="Red River Floodway">
<text>The Red River Floodway () is an artificial flood control waterway in Western Canada. It is a long channel which, during flood periods, takes part of the Red River&#x27;s flow around the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba to the east and discharges it back into the Red River below the dam at Lockport. It can carry floodwater at a rate of up to , expanded in the 2000s from its original channel capacity of .

The Floodway was pejoratively nicknamed Duff&#x27;s Ditch by opponents of its construction, after Premier Duff Roblin, whose Progressive Conservative government initiated the project, partly in response to the disastrous 1950 Red River flood. It was completed in time and under budget. Subsequent events have vindicated the plan, leading to the nickname becoming an affectionate one. Since its completion in 1968, the Floodway is estimated to have prevented over $40 billion in cumulative flood damage. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2000, as the floodway is an outstanding engineering achievement both in terms of function and impact.

From south to north, the Floodway passes through the extreme southeastern part of Winnipeg and the rural municipalities of Ritchot, Springfield, East St. Paul, and St. Clements.

== History ==
Following the submission of the Royal Commission report Manitobans were strongly divided as to whether the province could afford the capital costs of a mammoth engineering project that would benefit primarily Winnipeg. The project was championed by Dufferin (Duff) Roblin, the Leader of the Opposition and head of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party, but it was vehemently denounced by opponents as a monumental, and potentially ruinous, waste of money. Indeed, the projected Red River Floodway was derisively referred to as “Duff”s Folly” and “Duff’s Ditch”, and decried as “approximating the building of the pyramids of Egypt in terms of usefulness.” The construction of the floodway and Assiniboine River works, would entail a capital cost of over $72 million, amortized over fifty years at 4% interest, at a time when the province had a population of only 900,000 and an annual net provincial revenue of about $74 million. Following the formation of a new provincial government in June 1958, Duff Roblin, the newly elected Premier of Manitoba, continued to promote the floodway, and managed to secure a commitment from the federal government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to pay up to 60% of the construction costs.

Construction of the Floodway started on November 27, 1962, and finished in March 1968. The construction was a major undertaking with of earth excavated—more than what was moved for the Suez Canal.

At the time, the project was the second largest earth-moving project in the world – next only to the construction of the Panama Canal. The total cost at the time was $63 million, equivalent to approximately $505 million today.

== Design ==

The Floodway protection system includes more than just the channel to the east of the city, but also the dikes along the river through Winnipeg and the West Dike extending to the southwest from the floodway inlet. Primarily as a result of the Floodway, the city suffered little flood damage. After the 1997 flood, a 2004 re-assessment of the floodway and its channel capacity indicated that could be passed through the floodway during a major flood, but this is considered above the design capacity as it would submerge bridges, and the decision was made to further expand the floodway.

Although the term &quot;floodway gates&quot; is used for the control structure, this is a misnomer as the gates are actually on the Red River as it enters the city and not on the floodway channel. When Red River flows exceed what can safely be handled by the river channel within the city, the gates begin to close by rising up out of the river bed, to the degree needed, restricting water flow into the city to manageable amounts. The resulting upstream back-up of the Red River then flows into the adjacent floodway entrance, diverting the excess flow that could not be safely handled by the river channel within the city. Under flood conditions, even when the floodway is in operation, the Red River within the city will still carry greater than normal amounts of water and some local flood mitigation measures still may be required within the city. The rise in river levels upstream of the gates when in operation needs to be contained by a diking system.

The West Dike which extends to near the village of Brunkild is the limiting factor on the volume of water that can be diverted around the city, as a result of the extremely low grades in the area. This dike was urgently extended by 42 km from its previous western terminus near Domain MB in 1997 to prevent flood water from doing an end run around the original dike. In 2003, the province announced plans to expand the Floodway, increasing its flow capacity from . It was decided to widen the Floodway as opposed to deepening it because of the soil and ground conditions in the area. Many underground aquifers in the area are used for drinking water for rural residents and the aquifers could potentially be contaminated if the floodway were deeper. There is also potential for pressures to increase in the aquifers, causing a &quot;blowout&quot; to occur, where water would flow from the aquifers in the ground to the surface and reduce the capacity of the Floodway. Officials decided widening the floodway would be the best option despite the lower hydraulic capacity that would result.

== Flow rates ==
Below are the peak flow rates recorded on the Red River Floodway since it was completed in 1968.

==1997 Red River Flood==
The 1997 flood was a 100-year flood. It came close to overwhelming Winnipeg&#x27;s existing flood protection system. At the time, the Winnipeg Floodway was designed to protect against a flow of , but the 1997 flow was . To compensate, the province broke operational rules for the Floodway, as defined in legislation, during the night of April 30 / May 1, to prevent waters in Winnipeg from rising above the designed limit of above the &quot;James Avenue datum&quot;, but causing additional flooding upriver. Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson, announcing that the design limit had been reached, misinterpreted this as good news that the flooding had peaked. City sand-bagging stopped, and national reporters left the city, but the water continued to rise inside and outside of the city until the peak late on May 3 / early on May 4. The city officials have said that the peak occurred on May 1; scientific reports record a peak on May 3/4.

== Expansion ==
Since the 1997 flood resulted in water levels that took the existing floodway to the limits of its capacity, various levels of government commissioned engineering studies for a major increase in flood protection for the City of Winnipeg. Work began in late 2005 under a provincial collective bargaining agreement and has included modifications to rail and road crossings as well as transmission line spans, upgrades to inlet control structures and fire protection, increased elevation of existing dikes (including the Brunkild dike), and the widening of the entire floodway channel. The NDP government set aside a portion of the construction budget for aboriginal construction firms. The &quot;Red River Floodway Expansion&quot; was completed in late 2010 at a final cost of more than $665,000,000. Since the completion of the expansion, the capacity of the floodway has increased to per second, the estimated level of a 1-in-700 year flood event. (Using the flow rates of Niagara Falls as a standard of comparison, this is more than double its average of 1,833 cubic metres and about a third over its maximum.) The expanded floodway now protects over 140,000 homes, over 8,000 businesses, and will prevent more than $12 billion in damage to the provincial economy in the event of a 1-in-700 year flood.

The NDP government was criticized by Conservative Brian Pallister, then the Member of Parliament, for requiring workers in construction companies working on the floodway to unionize. Pallister, MP for the Portage—Lisgar constituency and future Manitoba premier, told parliament, &quot;the Manitoba NDP government is planning to proceed with a plan to force every worker on the Red River floodway expansion to unionize, despite the fact that 95% of Manitoba&#x27;s construction companies are not unionized.&quot;

The diversion of flood water has been criticized for shifting the impact of flooding from urban Winnipeg to rural communities such as Emerson, Morris, St Adolphe. In 1997 these towns and the surrounding farm buildings and lands ended up with the bulk of the flood water in order to save Winnipeg from flood damage. In 2011, the Manitoba government intentionally diverted water from the Assiniboine River to save Winnipeg which ended up flooding communities around Lake Manitoba - The communities of Pinaymootang, Lake St. Martin, Little Saskatchewan and Dauphin River were severely impacted, as well as the surrounding farmland and cottages.

== Considerations in the United States ==
The city of Fargo, North Dakota faces very similar flooding challenges to Winnipeg due to its similar topography and position upstream of the Red River. In 2008, the US Army Corps of Engineers began a feasibility study of flood mitigation techniques for the area. During this study, the city faced catastrophic flooding, catapulting the project into public consciousness. In 2010, the US Federal government agreed to work with the city, its smaller sister city of Moorhead, Minnesota, as well as Cass and Clay counties to begin the formal planning process. The Federal government additionally pledged significant financial support for the project. The result was the Fargo-Moorhead Area Diversion Project, which is planned to be operational in 2027.

<text>The hyoid bone (lingual bone or tongue-bone) () is a horseshoe-shaped bone situated in the anterior midline of the neck between the chin and the thyroid cartilage. At rest, it lies between the base of the mandible and the third cervical vertebra.

Unlike other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments. It is the only bone in the human body that is not connected to any other bones. The hyoid is anchored by muscles from the anterior, posterior and inferior directions, and aids in tongue movement and swallowing. The hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the larynx below, and the epiglottis and pharynx behind.

Its name is derived .

==Structure==
The hyoid bone is classed as an irregular bone and consists of a central part called the body, and two pairs of horns, the greater and lesser horns.

=== Body ===

The body of the hyoid bone is the central part of the hyoid bone.
*At the front, the body is convex and directed forward and upward.
* It is crossed in its upper half by a well-marked transverse ridge with a slight downward convexity, and in many cases a vertical median ridge divides it into two lateral halves. 
* The portion of the vertical ridge above the transverse line is present in a majority of specimens, but the lower portion is evident only in rare cases.
* The anterior surface gives insertion to the geniohyoid muscle in the greater part of its extent both above and below the transverse ridge; a portion of the origin of the hyoglossus notches the lateral margin of the geniohyoid attachment. 
* Below the transverse ridge the mylohyoid, sternohyoid, and omohyoid are inserted.
* At the back, the smooth, concave, directed backward and downward, and separated from the epiglottis by the hyothyroid membrane and a quantity of loose areolar tissue; a bursa intervenes between it and the hyothyroid membrane.
* Above, the body is rounded, and gives attachment to the hyothyroid membrane and some aponeurotic fibers of the genioglossus.
* Below, the body affords insertion medially to the sternohyoid and laterally to the omohyoid and occasionally a portion of the thyrohyoid. It also gives attachment to the Levator glandulae thyreoideae, when this muscle is present.

===Horns===

The greater and lesser horns () are two sections of bone that project from each side of the hyoid.

==== Greater horns ====
The greater horns project backward from the outer borders of the body; they are flattened from above downward and taper to their end, which is a bony tubercle connecting to the lateral thyrohyoid ligament. The upper surface of the greater horns are rough and close to its lateral border, and facilitates muscular attachment. The largest of muscles that attach to the upper surface of the greater horns are the hyoglossus and the middle pharyngeal constrictor, which extend along the whole length of the horns; the digastric muscle and stylohyoid muscle have small insertions in front of these near the junction of the body with the horns. To the medial border, the thyrohyoid membrane is attached, while the anterior half of the lateral border gives insertion to the thyrohyoid muscle.

==== Lesser horns ====
The lesser horns are two small, conical eminences, attached by their bases to the angles of junction between the body and greater horns of the hyoid bone. They are connected to the body of the bone by fibrous tissue, and occasionally to the greater horns by distinct diarthrodial joints, which usually persist throughout life, but occasionally become ankylosed. The lesser horns are situated in the line of the transverse ridge on the body and appear to be continuations of it. The apex of each horn gives attachment to the stylohyoid ligament; the chondroglossus rises from the medial side of the base.

===Development===
The second pharyngeal arch, also called the hyoid arch, gives rise to the lesser cornu of the hyoid and the upper part of the body of the hyoid. The cartilage of the third pharyngeal arch forms the greater cornu of the hyoid and the lower portion of the body of the hyoid.

The hyoid is ossified from six centers: two for the body, and one for each cornu. Ossification commences in the greater cornua toward the end of fetal development, in the hyoid body shortly afterward, and in the lesser cornua during the first or second year after birth. Until middle age, the connection between the body and greater cornu is fibrous.

In early life, the outer borders of the body are connected to the greater horns by synchondroses; after middle life, usually by bony union.

===Blood supply===
Blood is supplied to the hyoid bone via the lingual artery, which runs down from the tongue to the greater horns of the bone. The suprahyoid branch of the lingual artery runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone and supplies blood to the attached muscles.

==Function==

The hyoid bone is present in many mammals. It allows a wider range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation. Its descent in living creatures is not unique to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, and does not allow the production of a wide range of sounds: with a lower larynx, men do not produce a wider range of sounds than women and two-year-old babies. Moreover, the larynx position of Neanderthals was not a handicap to producing speech sounds. The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities. However, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid is not indicative of the larynx&#x27;s position. Recent research has indicated that the hyoid bone may have significant involvement in the ability to swallow. It has been hypothesized that the mammalian hyoid bone evolved in conjunction with the development of lactation, thus allowing babies to suckle milk. It is necessary to take into consideration the skull base, the mandible and the cervical vertebrae and a cranial reference plane.

===Muscle attachments===
A large number of muscles attach to the hyoid:

*Superior
**Middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle
**Hyoglossus muscle
**Genioglossus
**Intrinsic muscles of the tongue
**Suprahyoid muscles
***Digastric muscle
***Stylohyoid muscle
***Geniohyoid muscle
***Mylohyoid muscle
*Inferior
**Thyrohyoid muscle
**Omohyoid muscle
**Sternohyoid muscle
**Sternothyroid muscle

==Clinical significance==
The hyoid bone is important to a number of physiological functions, including breathing, swallowing and speech. It is also thought to play a key role in keeping the upper airway open during sleep, and as such, the development and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep). A mechanistic involvement of the hyoid bone in OSA is supported by numerous studies demonstrating that a more inferiorly positioned hyoid bone is strongly associated with the presence and severity of the disorder. Movement of the hyoid bone is also thought to be important in modifying upper airway properties, which was recently demonstrated in computer model simulations. A surgical procedure that aims to potentially increase and improve the airway is called hyoid suspension.

Due to its position, the hyoid bone is not easily susceptible to fracture. In a suspected case of murder or physical abuse of an adult, a fractured hyoid strongly indicates throttling or strangulation. In children and adolescents (in whom the hyoid bone is still flexible because ossification is yet to be completed) fracture may not occur even after serious trauma.

==Other animals==
The hyoid bone is derived from the lower half of the second gill arch in fish, which separates the first gill slit from the spiracle, and is often called the &quot;hyoid arch&quot;. In many vertebrates, it also incorporates elements of other gill arches, and has a correspondingly greater number of cornua. Amphibians and non-avian reptiles may have many cornua, while mammals (including humans) have two pairs, and birds only one. In birds, and some reptiles, the body of the hyoid is greatly extended forward, creating a solid bony support for the tongue. The howler monkey &quot;Alouatta&quot; has a pneumatized hyoid bone, one of the few cases of postcranial pneumatization of bones outside Saurischia.

In woodpeckers, the hyoid bone is elongated, with the horns wrapping around the back of the skull. This is part of the system that keeps the brain cushioned and undamaged by the pecking action.

In mammals, the hyoid often determines whether one can roar. If the hyoid is incompletely ossified (for example: lions), it allows the animal to roar, but not purr. If the hyoid is completely ossified (for example: cheetahs), it does not allow the animal to roar, but instead will allow the animal to purr and meow, as seen in house cats (lions, cheetahs and house cats all belong to the family Felidae).
In veterinary anatomy, the term hyoid apparatus is the collective term used to refer to the bones of the tongue—a pair of stylohyoidea, a pair of thyrohyoidea, and unpaired basihyoideum—and associated, upper-gular connective tissues. In humans, the single hyoid bone is an equivalent of the hyoid apparatus.

<text>The Squaliformes are an order of sharks that includes about 126 species in seven families.

Members of the order have two dorsal fins, which usually possess spines, they usually have a sharp head, no anal fin or nictitating membrane, and five to seven gill slits. In most other respects, however, they are quite variable in form and size. Most species of the squaliform order live in saltwater or brackish water. They are found worldwide, from northern to tropical waters, and from shallow coastal seas to the open ocean.

All members of the family Etmoperidae and Dalatiidae and &quot;Zameus squamulosus&quot; possess photophores, luminous organs, and exhibit intrinsic bioluminescence. Bioluminescence evolved once in Squaliformes, approximately 111–153 million years ago, and helped the Squaliformes radiate and adapt to the deep sea. The common ancestor of Dalatiidae, Etmopteridae, Somniosidae, and Oxynotidae possessed a luminous organ and used bioluminescence for camouflage by counterillumination. Counterillumination is an active form of camouflage in which an organism emits light to match the intensity of downwelling light to hide from predators below. Currently, bioluminescence provides different functions for Squaliformes based on the family. Dalatiidae and &quot;Zameus squamulosus&quot; possess simple photophores and use bioluminescence for ventral counter-illumination. Etmopteridae possess more complex photophores and utilize bioluminescence for ventral counter illumination as well as species recognition.

Many squaliforms have a spine in front of each of the two dorsal fins, likely a trait of the common ancestor of this clade. The clade likely originated in the post-Jurassic shallow waters of the northern Tethyal margin.

<text>Tongue bifurcation, splitting or forking, is a type of body modification in which the tongue is cut centrally from its tip to as far back as the underside base, forking the end.

Bifid tongue in humans may also be an unintended complication of tongue piercings or a rare congenital malformation associated with maternal diabetes, orofaciodigital syndrome 1, Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, and Klippel–Feil syndrome.

==Practice==
Deliberate tongue splitting is a cosmetic body modification procedure that results in a ‘lizard-like’ bifid tongue. Tongue bifurcation has also been reported as an unintended complication of tongue piercing. 

=== Process ===
Tongue bifurcation may be done surgically using a scalpel, or cauterised with a laser. It is performed by oral surgeons, plastic surgeons, or body modification practitioners, or done oneself, but only oral and plastic surgeons are licensed. Before splitting with any method, some choose to have a well-healed tongue piercing where the back end of the split is intended to be. This effectively prevents the tongue from healing forward from the back of the cut, which would result in a split that is not as deep as desired.

When using the scalpel method, the tongue is cut down the middle with a scalpel and each half is stitched or sutured along the cut edge. This helps prevent the sides from healing back to each other and also achieves a more rounded and natural look. In some cases the scalpel is heated to provide a cauterizing effect, limiting bleeding.

Cauterizing can be done with a cautery unit or an argon laser. Both burn the tongue in half which closes off blood vessels, preventing much bleeding. If an established tongue piercing is not used as the back end of the split with this method, the tongue has a higher tendency to heal and the procedure must be done again to achieve the depth desired. 

The tongue generally heals in 1–2 weeks, during which time the person may have difficulty with speech or their normal dietary habits. Splitting may be reversed surgically by removal of sutures, excision of healed tissue on edges, and re-suturing the tongue together. 

Once healed, muscle control of the individual sides can be gained with practice if the split is sufficiently deep. The two halves can be raised up and down opposite each other, spread apart from the other half which makes the split quite apparent and some objects can be grasped onto and held. 

Bifid tongues may be concealed if desired by holding the two halves together. When the two sides are held together, it may appear as though there is only a deep crevice in the centre of the tongue. 
=== Complications ===
Surgical tongue splitting may result in inflammation, bleeding (including hemorrhage), infection, and injury to nerves or arteries on the tongue.
A bifurcated tongue may also perceptibly alter fricative production. Resulting scar tissue may also affect speech.
===Motivation===
Proponents of body modifications such as tongue bifurcation may feel that body modification leads to a sense of strength and empowerment, assists pair or group bonding, or promotes emotional recovery from trauma. Proponents may simply like the appearance, considering it beautiful, enjoy the novelty or shock value, or believe it leads to increased sensation or enhancement when kissing. Challenging oneself, rites of passage, connecting with or being in control of one&#x27;s body, making a spiritual connection or testing the body&#x27;s limits are also reasons given. Like all body modifications, it can be used to connect or identify with a specific group or to ward off those who would make quick undesired judgments based on appearance.

===Legality===
The legality of tongue splitting varies greatly depending on the country and within those countries, individual states or territories. Some examples are given below, but do not encompass all the laws regarding this subject.
==== United States of America ====
Some branches of the U.S. military ban body modifications that detract from a professional military image and explicitly include tongue splitting or forking as examples.

In 2003, Illinois became the first state in the U.S. to regulate tongue splitting, passing a law making it illegal to perform the procedure on another person, unless it is done by someone licensed to practice medicine. The law does not appear to prohibit performing the procedure on one&#x27;s self. Since then New York, Delaware, and Texas have enacted laws that either ban the practice, ban the procedure on minors without parental consent, or restrict it to being performed by only doctors and/or dentists.
==== Australia ==== 
In 2009, the Australian state of Victoria enacted a ban on splitting the tongues of minors.
==== United Kingdom ==== 
In 2017 Brendan McCarthy was charged in the United Kingdom for a number of body modifications including tongue splitting. He pleaded guilty in 2019 to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Cases of body modification artists illegally possessing and injecting local anaesthetics for tongue bifurcation procedures have also been recorded in England.

In March 2018, the Court of Appeal ruled tongue splitting to be illegal in England and Wales when performed by a body modification practitioner for cosmetic purposes.

==Notable cases==
Dustin Allor, a 19-year-old body piercer in the U.S., split her tongue herself in 1996. Not having any reference of this being done before, she came up with the tie-off or fishing line method. In 1997 she was featured on the cover of Fakir Musafar&#x27;s Body Play Magazine.

A sideshow performer named Erik Sprague, known professionally as The Lizardman, had his tongue split on July 18, 1997. His procedure was performed by oral surgeon Dr. Lawrence Busino, using an argon laser, in what was the first truly professional tongue split. A new deeper split was done on October 3, 1997. This was the third modern tongue bifurcation and the first one done using a laser. Around the same time, a 28-year-old woman performed the same procedure in New York.

<doc id="251010" wikidata="Q913572" url="?curid=251010" title="Whiskers">
<text>Whiskers or vibrissae (; : vibrissa; ) are a type of stiff, functional hair used by most therian mammals to sense their environment. These hairs are finely specialised for this purpose, whereas other types of hair are coarser as tactile sensors. Although whiskers are specifically those found around the face, vibrissae are known to grow in clusters at various places around the body. Most mammals have them, including all non-human primates and especially nocturnal mammals. Monotremes, however, lack them.

Whiskers are sensitive tactile hairs that aid navigation, locomotion, exploration, hunting, social touch and perform other functions. 

This article is primarily about the specialised sensing hairs of mammals, but some birds, fish, insects, crustaceans and other arthropods are known to have similar structures also used to sense the environment.

==Etymology==
Vibrissae (from Latin &#x27;to vibrate&#x27;) from the characteristic motion seen in a small rodent that is otherwise sitting still.
In medicine, the term also refers to the thick hairs found inside human nostrils.

==Evolution==
The last common ancestor of all extant mammals had vibrissae. All other extant mammal species besides great apes retain the same ancestral layout of the whiskers along with the special facial muscles that move them.

== Anatomy ==
Vibrissae are anatomically distinguished from other hair. They are easily visually identified since they are longer, stiffer, significantly larger in diameter, and stand above the surrounding fur by a considerable amount. In addition, they have well-innervated follicles, and an identifiable representation in the somatosensory cortex of the brain. The largest number and the longest are found among the small, social, arboreal, and nocturnal mammals. Whiskers of aquatic mammals are the most sensitive. During foraging in complex, dark habitats, whiskers are rapidly moved in a cyclic way, tracing small circles at their tips. This motion, called &quot;whisking&quot; can occur at speeds of 25 Hz in mice, which is one of the fastest movements that mammals can make. Small animals use whisking to position their front paws during locomotion.

=== Vibrissal groups ===

Vibrissae typically grow in clusters. These groups vary somewhat in form and function, but they are relatively consistent among land mammals. Between land and marine mammals, there is less consistency (though commonalities are certainly present).

Many land mammals, like rats and hamsters, have four typical whisker groups on their heads (called &quot;cranial vibrissae&quot;), which might vary among animals due to different lifestyles. These cranial groups include:
* above the eyes (&quot;supraorbital&quot;)
* on the cheeks (&quot;genal&quot;)
* where a moustache would be (&quot;mystacial&quot;)
* under the snout (&quot;mandibular&quot;).
The mystacial whiskers can be roughly identified as &quot;macrovibrissae&quot; (long whiskers for feeling the space around the head) and &quot;microvibrissae&quot; (small, down-pointing whiskers for identifying objects). Not only are these two types hard to distinguish on an animal&#x27;s face (see for example the image of a rat here), there are similarly weak distinctions in how they are used, though the distinction is nonetheless referred to ubiquitously in scientific literature and is considered useful in analysis.

Many land mammals, including domestic cats, also have vibrissae on the underside of the leg just above the paws (called &quot;carpal vibrissae&quot;). Whilst these five major groups are often reported in studies of land mammals, several other groups have been reported more occasionally; for instance &quot;nasal&quot;, &quot;angular&quot;, and &quot;submental whiskers&quot;.

Marine mammals can have substantially different arrangements of their vibrissae. For instance, whales and dolphins have lost their snout whiskers and gained vibrissae around their blowholes, whereas every single one of the body hairs of the Florida manatee may be a vibrissa (see image). Other marine mammals, like seals and sea-lions, have head vibrissae just like those on land mammals (see image), although these groups function quite differently.

Vibrissal follicles have evolved other functions in dolphins, such as electroreception.

=== Vibrissae ===
The vibrissal hair is usually thicker and stiffer than other types of (pelagic) hair but, like other hairs, the shaft consists of an inert material (keratin) and contains no nerves. However, vibrissae are different from other hair structures because they grow from a special hair follicle incorporating a capsule of blood called a blood sinus which is heavily innervated by sensory nerves. Vibrissae are symmetrically arranged in groups on the face and supply the trigeminal nerve.

The mystacial macrovibrissae are shared by a large group of land and marine mammals (see images), and it is this group that has received by far the most scientific study. The arrangement of these whiskers is not random: they form an ordered grid of arcs (columns) and rows, with shorter whiskers at the front and longer whiskers at the rear (see images). In the mouse, gerbil, hamster, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat, each individual follicle is innervated by 100–200 primary afferent nerve cells. These cells serve an even larger number of mechanoreceptors of at least eight distinct types. Accordingly, even small deflections of the vibrissal hair can evoke a sensory response in the animal. Rats and mice typically have approximately 30 macrovibrissae on each side of the face, with whisker lengths up to around 50 mm in (laboratory) rats, 30 mm in (laboratory) mice, and a slightly larger number of microvibrissae. Thus, an estimate for the total number of sensory nerve cells serving the mystacial vibrissal array on the face of a rat or mouse might be 25,000. Natural shapes of rat&#x27;s mystacial pad vibrissae are well approximated by pieces of the Euler spiral. When all these pieces for a single rat are assembled together, they span an interval extending from one coiled domain of the Euler spiral to the other.

Marine mammals may make even greater investment in their vibrissal sensory system than rats and mice. Seal whiskers, which are similarly arrayed across the mystacial region, are each served by around 10 times as many nerve fibres as those in rats and mice, so that the total number of nerve cells innervating the mystacial vibrissae of a seal has been estimated to be in excess of 300,000. Manatees, remarkably, have around 600 vibrissae on or around their lips.

Whiskers can be very long in some species; the length of a chinchilla&#x27;s whiskers can be more than a third of its body length (see image). Even in species with shorter whiskers, they can be very prominent appendages (see images). Thus, whilst whiskers certainly could be described as &quot;proximal sensors&quot; in contrast to, say, eyes, they offer a tactile sense with a sensing range that is functionally very significant.

== Operation ==

=== Movement ===
The follicles of some groups of vibrissae in some species are motile. Generally, the supraorbital, genal and macrovibrissae are motile, whereas the microvibrissae are not. This is reflected in anatomical reports that have identified musculature associated with the macrovibrissae that is absent for the microvibrissae. A small muscle &#x27;sling&#x27; is attached to each macrovibrissa and can move it more-or-less independently of the others, whilst larger muscles in the surrounding tissue move many or all of the macrovibrissae together.

Amongst those species with motile macrovibrissae, some (rats, mice, flying squirrels, gerbils, chinchillas, hamsters, shrews, porcupines, opossums) move them back and forth periodically in a movement known as &quot;whisking&quot;, while other species (cats, dogs, raccoons, pandas) do not appear to. The distribution of mechanoreceptor types in the whisker follicle differs between rats and cats, which may correspond to this difference in the way they are used. Whisking movements are amongst the fastest produced by mammals. In all whisking animals in which it has so far been measured, these whisking movements are rapidly controlled in response to behavioural and environmental conditions. The whisking movements occur in bouts of variable duration, and at rates between 3 and 25 whisks/second. Movements of the whiskers are closely coordinated with those of the head and body.

=== Function ===
Generally, vibrissae are considered to mediate a tactile sense, complementary to that of skin. This is presumed to be advantageous in particular to animals that cannot always rely on sight to navigate or to find food, for example, nocturnal animals or animals which forage in muddy waters. Whiskers can also function as wind detecting antannae such as the supra-orbital ones in rats.

Sensory function aside, movements of the vibrissae may also indicate something of the state of mind of the animal, and the whiskers play a role in social behaviour of rats.

The sensory function of vibrissae is an active research area—experiments to establish the capabilities of whiskers use a variety of techniques, including temporary deprivation either of the whisker sense or of other senses. Animals can be deprived of their whisker sense for a period of weeks by whisker trimming (they soon grow back), or for the duration of an experimental trial by restraining the whiskers with a flexible cover like a mask (the latter technique is used, in particular, in studies of marine mammals). Such experiments have shown that whiskers are required for, or contribute to: object localization, orienting of the snout, detection of movement, texture discrimination, shape discrimination, exploration, thigmotaxis, locomotion, maintenance of equilibrium, maze learning, swimming, locating food pellets, locating food animals, and fighting, as well as nipple attachment and huddling in rat pups.

Whisking—the periodic movement of the whiskers—is also presumed to serve tactile sensing in some way. However, exactly why an animal might be driven &quot;to beat the night with sticks&quot;, as one researcher once put it, is a matter of debate, and the answer is probably multi-faceted. Scholarpedia offers:

Animals that do not whisk, but have motile whiskers, presumably also gain some advantage from the investment in musculature. Dorothy Souza, in her book &quot;Look What Whiskers Can Do&quot; reports some whisker movement during prey capture (in cats, in this case):

Anecdotally, it is often stated that cats use their whiskers to gauge whether an opening is wide enough for their body to pass through. This is sometimes supported by the statement that the whiskers of individual cats extend out to about the same width as the cat&#x27;s body, but at least two informal reports indicate that whisker length is genetically determined and does not vary as the cat grows thinner or fatter. In the laboratory, rats are able to accurately (within 5–10%) discriminate the size of an opening, so it seems likely that cats can use their whiskers for this purpose. However, reports of cats, particularly kittens, with their heads firmly stuck in some discarded receptacle are commonplace indicating that if a cat has this information available, it does not always make best use of it.

====Marine mammals====
Pinnipeds have well-developed tactile senses. Their mystacial vibrissae have ten times the innervation of terrestrial mammals, allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the water. These vibrations are generated, for example, when a fish swims through water. Detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging and may add to or even replace vision, particularly in darkness.
Harbor seals have been observed following varying paths of other organisms that swam ahead several minutes before, similar to a dog following a scent trail, and even to discriminate the species and the size of the fish responsible for the trail. Blind ringed seals have even been observed successfully hunting on their own in Lake Saimaa, likely relying on their vibrissae to gain sensory information and catch prey. Unlike terrestrial mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do not move their vibrissae over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and keep them in the same position. By holding their vibrissae steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The vibrissae of seals are undulated and wavy while sea lion and walrus vibrissae are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability. The vibrissa&#x27;s angle relative to the flow, and not the fiber shape, however, seems to be the most important factor.

Most cetaceans have whiskers at birth but they are typically lost during maturation. The follicles and any vestigial hair sometimes function as touch or electrical sense organs.

== Lines of research ==

=== Neuroscience ===
A large part of the brain of whisker-specialist mammals is involved in the processing of nerve impulses from vibrissae, a fact that presumably corresponds to the important position the sense occupies for the animal. Information from the vibrissae arrives in the brain via the trigeminal nerve and is delivered first into the trigeminal sensory complex of brainstem. From there, the most studied pathways are those leading up through parts of thalamus and into barrel cortex, though other major pathways through the superior colliculus in midbrain (a major visual structure in visual animals) and the cerebellum, to name but a couple, are increasingly coming under scrutiny. Neuroscientists, and other researchers, studying sensory systems favour the whisker system for a number of reasons (see Barrel cortex), not least the simple fact that laboratory rats and mice are whisker, rather than visual, specialists.

=== Evolutionary biology ===
The presence of mystacial vibrissae in distinct lineages (Rodentia, Afrotheria, marsupials) with remarkable conservation of operation suggests that they may be an old feature present in a common ancestor of all therian mammals. Indeed, some humans even still develop vestigial vibrissal muscles in the upper lip, consistent with the hypothesis that previous members of the human lineage had mystacial vibrissae. Thus, it is possible that the development of the whisker sensory system played an important role in mammalian development, more generally.

=== Artificial whiskers ===
Researchers have begun to build artificial whiskers of a variety of types, both to help them understand how biological whiskers work and as a tactile sense for robots. These efforts range from the abstract, through feature-specific models, to attempts to reproduce complete whiskered animals in robot form (ScratchBot and ShrewBot, both robots by Bristol Robotics Laboratory).

==In non-mammals==

A range of non-mammals possess structures which resemble or function similarly to mammalian whiskers.

===In birds===

Some birds possess specialized hair-like feathers called rictal bristles around the base of the beak which are sometimes referred to as whiskers.
The whiskered auklet (&quot;Aethia pygmaea&quot;) has striking, stiff white feathers protruding from above and below the eyes of the otherwise slate-grey bird, and a dark plume which swoops forward from the top of its head. Whiskered auklets sent through a maze of tunnels with their feathers taped back bumped their heads more than twice as often as they did when their feathers were free, indicating they use their feathers in a similar way to cats.

Other birds that have obvious &quot;whiskers&quot; are kiwis, flycatchers, swallows, nightjars, whip-poor-wills, the kākāpō and the long-whiskered owlet (&quot;Xenoglaux loweryi&quot;).

===In fish===

Some fish have slender, pendulous tactile organs near the mouth. These are often referred to as &quot;whiskers&quot;, although they are more correctly termed barbels. Fish that have barbels include the catfish, carp, goatfish, hagfish, sturgeon, zebrafish and some species of shark.

The Pimelodidae are a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes) commonly known as the long-whiskered catfishes.

===In pterosaurs===

Anurognathid pterosaurs had a rugose (wrinkled) jaw texture that has been interpreted as the attachment sites for vibrissae, though actual vibrissae have not been recorded. More recently, a specific type of feathers has been found around anurognathid mouths.

<doc id="251011" wikidata="Q298838" url="?curid=251011" title="Billy Connolly">
<text>Sir William Connolly (born 24 November 1942) is a Scottish actor, musician, television presenter, artist and retired stand-up comedian. He is sometimes known by the Scots nickname the Big Yin (&quot;the Big One&quot;). Known for his idiosyncratic and often improvised observational comedy, frequently including strong language, Connolly has topped many UK polls as the greatest stand-up comedian of all time. In 2022, he received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

Connolly&#x27;s trade, in the early 1960s, was that of a welder (specifically a boilermaker) in the Glasgow shipyards, but he gave it up towards the end of the decade to pursue a career as a folk singer. He first sang in the folk rock band the Humblebums alongside Gerry Rafferty and Tam Harvey, with whom he stayed until 1971, before beginning singing as a solo artist. In the early 1970s, Connolly made the transition from folk singer with a comedic persona to fully fledged comedian, for which he became best known. In 1972, he made his theatrical debut, at the Cottage Theatre in Cumbernauld, with a revue called &quot;Connolly&#x27;s Glasgow Flourish&quot;. He also played the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Also in 1972, Connolly&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Billy Connolly Live!&quot;, was produced, with a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues. In 1975, he reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;D.I.V.O.R.C.E.&quot;

As an actor, Connolly has appeared in various films, including &quot; Water&quot; (1985), &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996), &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997) (for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role), &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; (1999), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004), &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; (2008), &quot;Brave&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014).

On his 75th birthday in 2017, three portraits of Connolly were made by leading artists Jack Vettriano, John Byrne, and Rachel Maclean. These were later turned into part of Glasgow&#x27;s official mural trail. In October that year, he was knighted at Buckingham Palace by Prince William for services to entertainment and charity.

Connolly announced his retirement from comedy in 2018; in the years since, he has established himself as an artist. In 2020, he unveiled the fifth release from his &quot;Born on a Rainy Day&quot; collection in London, followed by another instalment later that year, and has subsequently issued another five collections. During the filming of the ITV documentary &quot;Billy Connolly: It&#x27;s Been a Pleasure&quot;, he described how art had given him &quot;a new lease of life&quot;.

== Early life ==
Connolly was born on 24 November 1942 at 69 Dover Street, &quot;on the linoleum, three floors up&quot;, in Anderston, Glasgow. This section of Dover Street, between Breadalbane and Claremont streets, was demolished in the 1970s. Connolly refers to this in his 1983 song &quot;I Wish I Was in Glasgow&quot; with the lines &quot;I would take you there and show you but they&#x27;ve pulled the building down&quot; and &quot;they bulldozed it all to make a road&quot;. The flat had only two rooms: a kitchen-living room, with a recess where the children slept, and another room for their parents. The family bathed in the kitchen sink, and there was no hot water.

Connolly was born to Catholic parents, William Connolly and Mary McLean, both of whom were of partly Irish descent. In 1946, when he was four years old, Connolly&#x27;s mother left her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt abandoned by her,&quot; Connolly explained in 2009. &quot;My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all sorts of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that&#x27;s where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, &#x27;I love you. Come with me.&#x27; Given the choice, I think &quot;I&#x27;d&quot; have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you&#x27;re standing. I don&#x27;t have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive.&quot;

Connolly and his older sister, Florence (named after their maternal grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by his father&#x27;s two sisters, Margaret and Mona Connolly, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. &quot;My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It&#x27;s just a belief that I&#x27;m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I&#x27;m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that.&quot; Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his &quot;great defender&quot;. &quot;To this day,&quot; he explained in 2009, &quot;Guys say, &#x27;God, your sister... We didn&#x27;t dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare&#x27;. She used to get after them.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon with her husband and two children. &quot;My mother said, &#x27;I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.&#x27;&quot; &quot;I said, &#x27;Did you speak to her?&#x27; &#x27;Oh, no, I didn&#x27;t,&#x27; she said. I thought, &#x27;Oh, my god. It&#x27;s like being a ghost while you&#x27;re still alive.&#x27; Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn&#x27;t bear that.&quot;

The aunts resented the children for the fact that they had to sacrifice their young lives to look after them. It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. &quot;It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, but having said that, I wish people wouldn&#x27;t do that. I wish people wouldn&#x27;t be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your &#x27;big&#x27; and keep your &#x27;rotten&#x27; and get out of my life, because, quite frankly, I would rather have gone to a children&#x27;s home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same. To this day, I&#x27;m still working on the things she did to me.&quot;

Connolly credits one of John Bradshaw&#x27;s publications with helping him deal with his past demons. &quot;He reckons that if this trauma happened to you when you were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And what you have to do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he&#x27;s something of a genius, Mr Bradshaw.&quot;

His father returned from the war a stranger to his children shortly after the move to Partick. He never spoke to them about their mother&#x27;s departure.
Connolly&#x27;s biography, &quot;Billy&quot;, written by wife Pamela Stephenson, documented years of physical and sexual abuse by his father, which began when he was ten and lasted until he was about 15. &quot;Sometimes, when father hit me, I flew over the settee backwards in a sitting position. It was fabulous. Just like real flying, except you didn&#x27;t get a cup of tea or a safety belt or anything.&quot; In 1949, Mona gave birth to a son, Michael, by a &quot;local man&quot;. He was presented as a brother to Billy and Flo, and nobody questioned it.

Connolly&#x27;s bedroom had double windows, which directly faced St Peter&#x27;s Primary School across the street. Now , the school has been converted into living accommodation. &quot;The school was very violent indeed. At first, in the infant school, the nuns were very violent. And then over here at St Peter&#x27;s, they were just strapping you all the time. I had a psychopath in here, called McDonald — Miss McDonald. &#x27;Big Rosie&#x27;, they called her. There was a guy with glasses in my class and she called him &#x27;four eyes&#x27;, and she was a teacher!&quot;

At St. Peter&#x27;s, Connolly decided that he wanted to make people laugh. &quot;I can remember the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. And I was sitting in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn&#x27;t all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it longer than I normally would because I really enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn&#x27;t something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly that if you can have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant.&quot; While at St Peter&#x27;s, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.

Connolly was a Wolf Cub with the 141st Glasgow Scout Group. He revisits the site of one field trip, Auchengillan scout camp, during his &quot;World Tour of Scotland&quot;. At age 12, Connolly decided he wanted to become a comedian but did not think that he fit the mould, feeling he needed to become more &quot;windswept and interesting&quot;. Also at that age, he joined an organisation called The Children of Mary. The group would visit people and say the Rosary, with a statue of the Lady of Lourdes in a shoebox. &quot;We were as welcome as haemorrhoids.&quot; The group would all kneel around the statue and pray. &quot;You could hear people hurrying prayers because there was a good television programme coming.&quot;

In the 1950s, Glasgow&#x27;s sandstone tenements fell out of favour with the planners, which resulted in new houses being built on the fields and farmlands in the outskirts of the city. Between the ages of fourteen and twenty, Connolly was brought up on a now-demolished council estate on Kinfauns Drive in the Drumchapel district of Glasgow, and would make the daily journey to St. Gerard&#x27;s Secondary School (also now defunct) in Govan, on the southern side of the River Clyde. He rode the bus to Partick, crossed the water by ferry and walked to 80 Vicarfield Street.

&quot;Drumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it&#x27;s &quot;in&quot; Glasgow, but just &quot;outside&quot; civilisation,&quot; he has joked. &quot;To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was fourteen and there was a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then — I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in quite so good condition now — but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me a lot of money to go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van.&quot;

Connolly revisited this tenement in Drumchapel during filming for &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; in 1992. &quot;It eventually started to pall. This dreadful atmosphere came about the place. It&#x27;s like Siberia. And once you&#x27;re out here, there&#x27;s no getting out of it. You have to buy your way out, or some kind of talent has to take you out, or you have to be very bright and move away to university.&quot;

Also at fourteen, Connolly started to become interested in music — mainly Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. At fifteen, he left school with two engineering qualifications, one collected by mistake which belonged to a boy named Connell.

Connolly was a year too young to work in the shipyards. Instead, he started working for John Smith&#x27;s Bookshop, on St Vincent Street, delivering books on his bicycle. He became a delivery-van driver with Bilslands&#x27; Bakery until he was sixteen, when he was deemed overqualified (due to his J1 and J2 certificates) to become an engineer. Instead, he worked as a boilermaker at Alexander Stephen and Sons shipyard in Linthouse.

&quot;What an extraordinary feeling,&quot; Connolly said, upon returning to the site of the now-demolished shipyard in 1992. &quot;I spent a great deal of my life in here. From age 16 to... well, I started at 15. I started my apprenticeship at 16 and finished when I was 21. Stayed till I was 22, and moved along. I finished welding when I was 24. When I came here, as an apprentice, there was six ships being built, right where I&#x27;m standing. It was an extraordinary place. A hive of activity. Welders, caulkers, platers, burners, joiners, engineers, electricians. I learned how men talked to one another, and how merciless Glasgow humour can be. It has made an indelible mark on me.&quot; His foreman was Sammy Boyd, but the two biggest influences on him, according to the book written by his wife Pamela, were Jimmy Lucas and Bobby Dalgleish. Jimmy was one of Billy&#x27;s trainers in the yard who helped him to hone his skills as a welder and a comedian.

Connolly also joined the Territorial Army Reserve unit 15th (Scottish) Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (15 PARA). He later commemorated his experiences in the song &quot;Weekend Soldier&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Origin of &quot;The Big Yin&quot; ===
Connolly&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Big Yin&quot; was first used during his adolescent years to differentiate between himself and his father. &quot;My father was a very strong man. Broad and strong. He had an neck collar. Huge, like a bull. He was &quot;Big Billy&quot; and I was &quot;Wee Billy&quot;. And then I got bigger than him, and the whole thing got out of control. And then I became &quot;The Big Yin&quot; in Scotland. So, we&#x27;d go into the pub and someone would say, &#x27;Billy Connolly was in.&#x27; &#x27;Oh? Big Billy or Wee Billy?&#x27; &#x27;The Big Yin.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, Wee Billy.&#x27; If you were a stranger, you&#x27;d think, &#x27;What are these people talking about?!&#x27;&quot;

=== 1960s ===
In the early 1960s, Connolly attended the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for the first time. After spending time on the city&#x27;s Rose Street, patronising the various drinking establishments, he became enamoured by some long-haired musicians and decided to model himself on them.

In 1965, after he had completed a 5-year apprenticeship as a boilermaker, Connolly accepted a ten-week job building an oil platform in Biafra, Nigeria. Upon his return to the United Kingdom, via Jersey, he worked briefly at John Brown &amp; Company but decided to walk out on a Fair Friday to focus on being a folk singer.

After watching &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, he bought his first banjo at the Barrowland market. He began to tour with the folkie crowd, including regular stints at The Scotia bar, on Stockwell Street, guided by folk singer Danny Kyle. &quot;I kind of introduced Billy to the folk clubs, such as there were in those days – there were very few in those days. We used to go to places like Saturday Late or the Montrose Street Glasgow Folk Club.&quot;

Connolly formed a folk-pop duo called the Humblebums with Tam Harvey. In 1969, they were joined by Gerry Rafferty, who had approached Connolly after a gig in Paisley. The band signed for independent label, Transatlantic Records, and after recording one album (1969&#x27;s &quot;First Collection of Merry Melodies&quot;), Harvey left the trio and Connolly and Rafferty went on to release two more albums: &quot;The New Humblebums&quot; (1969) and &quot;Open up the Door&quot; (1970). Connolly&#x27;s time with Rafferty possibly influenced his future comedy, because years later he would recall how Rafferty&#x27;s expert prank telephone calls, made while waiting to go on stage, used to make him &quot;scream&quot; with laughter. Connolly&#x27;s contributions were primarily straightforward pop-folk with quirky and lyrics, but he had not especially focused on comedy at this point.

In 1968, a 26-year-old Connolly married Springburn native and interior designer Iris Pressagh, with whom he had two children. They initially lived on Redlands Road in Glasgow&#x27;s West End, but, when fans began to wait out in the street, they moved to Drymen near the south-eastern shore of Loch Lomond.

Later that year, Connolly&#x27;s mother went to meet him backstage after a Humblebums gig in Dunoon, where she was working in the cafeteria at Dunoon General Hospital. It was the second and final meeting between them since she had abandoned Connolly. She had been living in the town with her partner, Willie Adams, with whom she had three daughters and a son. &quot;I went home to her house and stayed the night, instead of the hotel. The sadness is... She was a very nice woman, but we never got along. We both tried to like each other, and I don&#x27;t think she liked me very much. I don&#x27;t regret it, but I&#x27;m sad about it. I wish I&#x27;d liked her. And I wish she&#x27;d liked me.&quot;

In 1971, the Humblebums broke up, with Rafferty going on to record his solo album &quot;Can I Have My Money Back?&quot; Connolly returned to being a folk singer. His live performances featured humorous introductions that became increasingly long. The head of Transatlantic Records, Nat Joseph, who had signed the Humblebums and had nurtured their career, was concerned that Connolly find a way to develop a distinctive solo career just as his former bandmate, Gerry Rafferty, was doing. Joseph saw several of Connolly&#x27;s performances and noted his comedic skills. Joseph had nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer, Hamish Imlach, and saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian.

=== 1970s ===
In 1972, Connolly made his theatrical debut, at the Cottage Theatre in Cumbernauld, with a revue called &quot;Connolly&#x27;s Glasgow Flourish&quot;. He played the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with poet Tom Buchan, with whom he had written &quot;The Great Northern Welly Boot Show&quot;, and in costumes designed by the artist and writer John Byrne, who also designed the covers of the Humblebums&#x27; records.

Also in 1972, Nat Joseph produced Connolly&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Billy Connolly Live!&quot;, a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues that hinted at what was to follow. In late 1973, Joseph produced the breakthrough album that propelled Connolly to British stardom. Recorded at a small venue, The Tudor Hotel in Airdrie, the record was a double album titled &quot;Solo Concert&quot;. Releasing a live double-album by a comedian who was virtually unknown (except to a cult audience in Glasgow) was an unusual gambit by Joseph but his faith in Connolly&#x27;s talent turned out to be warranted. Joseph and his marketing team, which included publicist Martin Lewis, promoted the album to chart success on its release in 1974. It featured one of Connolly&#x27;s most famous comedy routines — &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; — in which he likens Christ&#x27;s Last Supper to a drunken night out in Glasgow. The recording was banned by many radio stations at the time.

In 1974, he sold out the Pavilion Theatre in his home town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly&#x27;s breakthrough was used to secure him a booking on Britain&#x27;s premier TV chat show, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Parkinson&quot;. Connolly made the most of the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he&#x27;d have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. &quot;When I finished that show, I came back to Glasgow, and I was coming through the airport and the whole airport started to applaud.&quot; Connolly became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: &quot;That programme changed my entire life.&quot; Parkinson, in the documentary, &quot;Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years&quot;, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the &#x27;bike joke&#x27; three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, &quot;Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, &#x27;Oh, fuck that!!&#x27; I don&#x27;t know where I got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me.&quot; Connolly&#x27;s success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.

His increased profile led to contact with other celebrities; including musicians such as Elton John. John at that time was trying to assist British performers whom he personally liked to achieve success in the United States (he had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket label). John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour, but the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. John&#x27;s American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedian – especially a Scotsman whose accent they found incomprehensible. &quot;In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes&quot;, he told Michael Parkinson two years later. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my audience. They made me feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit.&quot; The quip caused fellow guest Angie Dickinson to laugh uncontrollably.

Connolly continued to grow in popularity in the UK. In 1975, he signed with Polydor Records. Connolly continued to release live albums and he also recorded several comedic songs that enjoyed commercial success as novelty singles including parodies of Tammy Wynette&#x27;s song &quot;D.I.V.O.R.C.E.&quot; (which he performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in December 1975) and the Village People&#x27;s &quot;In the Navy&quot; (titled &quot;In the Brownies&quot;).

In 1976, Connolly&#x27;s first play, &quot;An&#x27; Me wi&#x27; a Bad Leg, Tae&quot;, opened in Irvine and toured in London. It was there that, after consuming a sizable amount of cocaine and alcohol, he collapsed on the floor of a recording studio. In 1979, Connolly met Pamela Stephenson, the New Zealand-born comedy actress, for the first time when he made a cameo appearance on the BBC sketch show, &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, in which she was one of the four regular performers.

Returning to the stage, Connolly embarked on his Big Wee Tour of Britain, performing 69 dates in 84 days. While backstage in Brighton, he met Stephenson for a second time. He confided in her that he was unhappy and that his current marriage was over. Back at his hotel, where they began an affair, he reportedly drank thirty brandies. &quot;What I saw of him – particularly in that dressing room – was that he was about to die,&quot; Stephenson said. &quot;He was very suicidal. He was throwing everything away, desperately trying to feel no pain at all. You know how you get a sense from some people when they are very self-destructive that there is something they are trying to bury? They&#x27;ve got something they are trying to forget, or they are trying to drown their sorrows? He was hurting in a very deep way. I thought, &#x27;If I leave this man, he&#x27;s going to die.&#x27;&quot;

Also in 1979, Connolly was invited by producer Martin Lewis to join the cast of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, the third in the series of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls&quot; fundraising shows for Amnesty International. Connolly was the first comedic performer in the series who was not an alumnus of the Oxbridge school of middle-class university-educated entertainers and he made the most of his appearance. Appearing in the company of long-established talents such as John Cleese and Peter Cook helped elevate the perception of Connolly as one of Britain&#x27;s leading comedic talents. Lewis also teamed Connolly with Cleese and Cook to appear in the television commercial for the album.

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, John Cleese and Martin Lewis invited Connolly to appear in that year&#x27;s Amnesty show, &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. The commercial success of the special US version of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; film (Miramax Films, 1982) introduced Connolly to a wider American audience, who were attracted to the film because of the presence of Monty Python members. His on-screen presence alongside these performers – who were already familiar to Anglophile comedy buffs – helped lay down a marker for Connolly&#x27;s eventual return to the US in his own right eight years later.

En route to begin filming &quot;Water&quot; (1985) in Saint Lucia, Connolly drank an excessive amount of alcohol on the plane. Upon arriving on the island, he had dinner with the cast and crew, including Michael Caine.

In 1985, he divorced Iris Pressagh, his wife of sixteen years (they had separated four years earlier), and he was awarded custody of their children Jamie and Cara. That same year, he performed &quot;An Audience with...&quot;, which was videotaped at the South Bank Television Centre in front of a celebrity audience for ITV. The uncut, uncensored version was subsequently released on video. In July 1985, Connolly performed at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, immediately preceding Elton John, whom he introduced on stage.

=== 1990s ===
Although Connolly had performed in North America as early as the 1970s and had appeared in several movies that played in American theatres, he nonetheless remained relatively unknown until 1990 when he was featured in the HBO special &quot;Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Connolly in Performance&quot;, produced by New York&#x27;s Brooklyn Academy of Music. Soon after, Connolly succeeded Howard Hesseman as the star of the sitcom, &quot;Head of the Class&quot; for its final season. He would also take part on its spin-off series &quot;Billy&quot;. Connolly joined boxer Frank Bruno and Ozzy Osbourne when singing &quot;The War Song of the Urpneys&quot; in the British animated television series &quot;The Dreamstone&quot;.

In 1991, HBO released &quot;Billy Connolly: Pale Blue Scottish Person&quot;, a standup performance recorded at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles, California.

On 4 June 1992, Connolly performed his 25th-anniversary concert in Glasgow. Parts of the show and its build-up were documented in &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, which aired later in the year. In early January 1994, Connolly began a 40-date &quot;World Tour of Scotland&quot;, which would be broadcast by the BBC later in the year as a six-part series. It was so well received he did &quot;Billy Connolly&#x27;s World Tour of Australia&quot; for the BBC in 1995. The eight-part series followed Connolly on his custom-made Harley Davidson trike. Also in 1995, Connolly recorded a BBC special, entitled &quot;A Scot in the Arctic&quot;, in which he spent a week by himself in the Arctic Circle. He voiced Captain John Smith&#x27;s shipmate, Ben, in Disney&#x27;s animated film, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;.

In 1996, he appeared in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; as Billy Bones. In 1997, he starred with Dame Judi Dench in &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;, in which he played John Brown, the favoured Scottish servant of Queen Victoria. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and a BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Actor, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

In 1998, Connolly&#x27;s best friend, Danny Kyle, died. &quot;He was my dearest, dearest, oldest friend&quot;, Connolly explained to an Australian audience on his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, released in 2001. It was Kyle who helped Connolly overcome his habit of recoiling on being touched by others, a remnant of the abuse he endured as a child. &quot;Every time it happened, Danny would just collapse with hysterics,&quot; said Pamela Stephenson. &quot;&#x27;That&#x27;s not normal, Billy,&#x27; Danny tried to be patient with him. &#x27;You&#x27;ll have to relax. It&#x27;s touchy-feely, you know, the way we live. We like to touch each other and we kiss: we&#x27;re different. You&#x27;ll have to calm down or you&#x27;ll always be fighting.&#x27;&quot;

He performed a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; song, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; on George Martin&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;In My Life&quot;. In November 1998, Connolly was the subject of a two-hour retrospective entitled, &quot;Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years&quot;, which included tributes from Dench, Sir Sean Connery, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Eddie Izzard.

In 1999, after forming Tickety-Boo management company with Malcolm Kingsnorth, his tour manager and sound engineer of 25 years, Connolly undertook a four-month, 59-date sellout tour of Australia and New Zealand. Later in the year, he completed a five-week, 25-date sellout run at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo.

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, Connolly starred in &quot;Beautiful Joe&quot; alongside Sharon Stone. The following year, he completed the third in his &quot;World Tour&quot; BBC series, this time of &quot;England, Ireland and Wales&quot;, which began in Dublin and ended in Plymouth. It was broadcast the following year. Also in 2001, Stephenson&#x27;s first biography of her husband, &quot;Billy&quot;, was published. Much of the book is about Connolly the celebrity but the account of his early years provides a context for his humour and point of view. A follow-up, &quot;Bravemouth&quot;, was published in 2003.

A fourth BBC series, &quot;World Tour of New Zealand&quot;, was filmed in 2004 and aired that winter. Also in his 63rd year, Connolly performed two sold-out benefit concerts at the Oxford New Theatre in memory of Malcolm Kingsnorth. He has continued to be a much in-demand character actor, appearing in several films such as &quot;White Oleander&quot; (2002), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), and &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004). He has played an eclectic collection of leading roles in recent years, including a lawyer who undertakes a legal case of Biblical proportions in &quot;The Man Who Sued God&quot; (2001), and a young boy&#x27;s pet zombie in &quot;Fido&quot; (2006).

In late 2004, Connolly was criticised for joking about hostage Kenneth Bigley after the beheading of two of Bigley&#x27;s colleagues, reportedly asking an audience &quot;Don’t you wish they would just get on with it?&quot; and &quot;What is it with him and that young Asian wife?&quot; Bigley was murdered by Tawhid and Jihad days later. Connolly responded that he had been &quot;desperately misquoted&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;d have to be in the room with 4,000 people laughing to understand.&quot; 

In 2005, Connolly and Stephenson announced, after fourteen years of living in Hollywood, they were returning to live in the former&#x27;s native land. They purchased a yacht with the profits from their house-sale and split the year between Malta and the 12-bedroom Candacraig House in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, which they had purchased in 1998 from Dame Anita Roddick.

Later in the year, Connolly topped an unscientific poll of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite Comedian&quot; conducted by the network Five, placing him ahead of performers such as John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, Dawn French, and Peter Cook. In 2006, he revealed he has a house on the Maltese island of Gozo. He and his wife also have an apartment in New York City near Union Square.

On 30 December 2007, Connolly escaped uninjured from a single-car accident on the A939 near Ballater, Aberdeenshire.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Connolly and his wife were living full-time in New York City, whilst retaining their Candacraig residence. The Connollys decided to sell Candacraig House in September 2013, with a price of £2.75 million.

In 2012, Connolly provided the voice of King Fergus in Pixar&#x27;s Scotland-set animated film &quot;Brave&quot;, alongside fellow Scottish actors Kelly Macdonald, Craig Ferguson, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson, and Kevin McKidd. Connolly appeared as Wilf in &quot;Quartet&quot;, a 2012 British comedy-drama film based on the play &quot;Quartet&quot; by Ronald Harwood, directed by Dustin Hoffman.

In 2014, he appeared in &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; as Dáin II Ironfoot, a great dwarf warrior and cousin of Thorin II Oakenshield. Peter Jackson stated: &quot;We could not think of a more fitting actor to play Dain Ironfoot, the staunchest and toughest of dwarves, than Billy Connolly, the Big Yin himself. With Billy stepping into this role, the cast of The Hobbit is now complete. We can&#x27;t wait to see him on the battlefield.&quot;

Steve Brown, Connolly&#x27;s manager of 32 years, died in December 2017 at the age of 72. In 2018, Connolly, now resident in Florida, held his first art exhibition. He stated at the time that he would no longer be touring as a comedian.

=== 2020s ===
As of 2021, he and his wife live in Florida. He published an autobiography, &quot;Windswept and Interesting&quot;, in October 2021.

In May 2022, Connolly received a BAFTA Fellowship in celebration of his five-decade long career.

== Personal life ==

Connolly married Iris Pressagh in 1969. They separated in 1981 and divorced in 1985. In 1981 he began living with Pamela Stephenson; they were married in Fiji on 20 December 1989. &quot;Marriage to Pam didn&#x27;t change me; it saved me,&quot; he later said. &quot;I was going to die. I was on a downwards spiral and enjoying every second of it. Not only was I dying, but I was looking forward to it.&quot; Connolly has two children from his first marriage and three from his second. He became a grandfather in 2001, when his daughter Cara gave birth to Walter.

In 1986, Connolly gave up alcohol, having been a heavy drinker. &quot;I don&#x27;t miss drinking. It has taken me by surprise,&quot; Connolly stated 24 years later. &quot;I miss the craic. I miss the joy of it all. The headbanging stupidity, the loveliness, the craziness of it. I miss it terribly.&quot; He recalls blackouts that he would fill in upon returning to sobriety. &quot;Well, [the memories] stopped coming back. But when I drank, I would go, &#x27;Oh, I remember now.&#x27;&quot; Connolly is describing the phenomenon of state-dependent learning. &quot;That was frightening. I remember thinking, &#x27;Beware, Billy boy. Beware. All is not well. Do something.&#x27;&quot; Regarding the decision he made to stay sober: &quot;If Pamela goes away, I&#x27;m on my own. There&#x27;s nothing. There&#x27;s only me and &quot;it&quot;. So the choice becomes very apparent.&quot;

Also in 1986, he visited Mozambique to appear in a documentary for Comic Relief. He also featured in the charity&#x27;s inaugural live stage show, both as a stand-up and portraying a willing &quot;victim&quot; in his partner Pamela Stephenson&#x27;s act of sawing a man in half to create two dwarfs. Connolly completed his first world tour in 1987, including six nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which was documented in the &quot;Billy and Albert&quot; video. In March 1988, his father died after a stroke, the eighth of his life. His mother died five years later, in 1993, of motor neurone disease.

In the book &quot;Billy&quot; (and in a December 2008 online interview), Connolly states he was sexually abused by his father between the ages of ten and fifteen. He believes this was a result of the Catholic Church not allowing his father to divorce after his mother left the family. Because of this, Connolly has a &quot;deep distrust and dislike of the Catholic church and any other organisation that brainwashes people&quot;. He has called himself an atheist.

In September 2013, Connolly underwent minor surgery for early-stage prostate cancer. The announcement also stated that he was being treated for the initial symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Connolly had acknowledged earlier in 2013 that he had started to forget his lines during performances. In January 2019, he disclosed that its advance may force his retirement from performing.

In 2018, Connolly moved to Key West, Florida. He supports Celtic. Connolly has attention deficit disorder.

=== Ancestry ===
Connolly&#x27;s paternal grandfather, whom—like his paternal grandmother—Connolly never met, was an Irish immigrant who left Ireland when he was ten years old. His great-great-great-grandfather (Charles Mills, a coast guard, 1796–1870) and great-great-grandfather (Bartholomew Valentine Connolly) were from Connemara.

His father was William Connolly; his mother, Mary &quot;Mamie&quot; McLean, was from the Clan Maclean of Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull on the west coast of Scotland. Mamie&#x27;s father, Neil, was a Protestant and her mother, Flora, was a Roman Catholic who &quot;made clandestine arrangements for the children to be baptised as Catholics&quot;, even though they were &quot;formally raised as Protestants&quot;. His maternal grandparents moved inland to Finnieston Street, Glasgow, in the early 1900s.

Connolly appeared on the BBC&#x27;s genealogy programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on 2 October 2014, in which he discovered his Indian ancestry. His maternal great-great-great-grandfather, John O&#x27;Brien, fought at the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He was wounded during the long siege by a severe gunshot to the left shoulder. He married a local 13-year-old Indian girl called Matilda. They had four children and settled in Bangalore after his military service.

=== Political views ===
Connolly has been a vocal opponent of Scottish independence. In 1974, he made a political party television broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party which criticised the Scottish National Party. In 1999, he blamed the SNP for a perceived increase in Anglophobia in Scotland; described the new Scottish Parliament as a joke; and declined to attend the opening ceremony.

Connolly questioned the expense of independence, and whether average Scots would benefit from another level of government, though he added &quot;Scots are very capable of making up their mind without my tuppence worth.&quot;

In April 2014, in an interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot; leading up to the independence referendum, he stated &quot;I think it&#x27;s time for people to get together, not split apart. The more people stay together, the happier they&#x27;ll be.&quot; He also referred to the Darien scheme, an effort to establish a Scottish colony in the Isthmus of Panama in 1698; the colony&#x27;s failure destroyed the Kingdom of Scotland&#x27;s economy and led to the Acts of Union in 1707. Connolly wrote, &quot;You must remember that the Union saved Scotland. Scotland was bankrupt and the English opened us up to their American and Canadian markets, from which we just flowered.&quot;

During an interview with the BBC prior to polling day for the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September 2014, Connolly revealed he would not be voting as he was flying to New Zealand that day. He re-iterated his view that the people of Scotland did not need his opinion to make up their minds on the subject.

In October 2018, several media outlets stated that in his book &quot;Made in Scotland&quot;, released on 10 October, Connolly had voiced his support for independence in light of the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit), in which Scotland voted to remain. &quot;The Times&quot; reported Connolly as calling the Brexit vote a &quot;disaster&quot; and saying that independence &quot;may be the way to go&quot; in order for Scotland to maintain a connection to Europe. In Episode Five of the BBC Scotland documentary, &quot;Billy and Us&quot;, first broadcast on 11 June 2020, he said &quot;I&#x27;ve never liked nationalism in any of its guises. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;ve never agreed with independence. I think a Scottish republic is as good an idea as any I ever heard.&quot;

=== Support for charity ===
Connolly is a patron of the National Association for Bikers with a Disability. He is also a patron of Celtic F.C.&#x27;s The Celtic Foundation.

== Other ventures ==
=== Folk music ===
In 1965, together with Tam Harvey, Connolly started a group called the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, &quot;My name&#x27;s Billy Connolly, and I&#x27;m humble. This is Tam Harvey, he&#x27;s a bum.&quot; The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. &quot;Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I&#x27;m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it&#x27;s all tricks really. He&#x27;s a musician and I&#x27;m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do.&quot;

After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.

Frank Bruno and Connolly provided lead vocals on, &quot;The War Song of the Urpneys&quot; from &quot;The Dreamstone&quot;; although the version heard in the series was largely sung by composer Mike Batt.

In his &quot;World Tour of Scotland&quot;, Connolly revealed that, at a trailer show during the Edinburgh Festival, the Humblebums took to the stage just before Yehudi Menuhin.

The Humblebums broke up in 1971 and both Connolly and Rafferty went solo. Connolly&#x27;s first solo album in 1972, &quot;Billy Connolly Live!&quot; on Transatlantic Records, featured him as a singer-songwriter.

His early albums were a mixture of comedy performances, with comedic and serious musical interludes. Among his best-known musical performances were &quot;The Welly Boot Song&quot;, a parody of the Scottish folk song &quot;The Wark O&#x27; the Weavers&quot;, which became his theme song for several years; &quot;In the Brownies&quot;, a parody of the hit Village People songs &quot;In the Navy&quot; and &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; (for which Connolly filmed a music video); &quot;Two Little Boys in Blue&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek indictment of police brutality done to the tune of Rolf Harris&#x27; &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;; and the ballad &quot;I Wish I Was in Glasgow&quot;, which Connolly would later perform in duet with Malcolm McDowell on a guest appearance on the 1990s American sitcom &quot;Pearl&quot; (which starred Rhea Perlman). He also performed the occasional Humblebums-era song such as, &quot;Oh, No!&quot; as well as straightforward covers such as a version of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, both of which were included on his &quot;Get Right Intae Him!&quot; album.

In November 1975, his rendition of Ben Colder&#x27;s 1969 spoof of the Tammy Wynette song &quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot; was a UK No. 1 single for one week. Wynette&#x27;s original was about parents spelling out words of an impending marital split to avoid traumatising their young child. The spoof version centred on dog owners using the same tactic to avoid worrying their pet about an impending trip to the vet (spelling out &quot;W-O-R-M&quot; or &quot;Q-U-A-R-A-N-T-I-N-E&quot;, for example). His song, &quot;No Chance&quot; was a parody of J. J. Barrie&#x27;s cover of the song &quot;No Charge&quot;.

In 1985, he sang the theme song to &quot;Super Gran&quot; which was released as a single. In 1996, he performed a cover of Ralph McTell&#x27;s &quot;In the Dreamtime&quot; as the theme to his &quot;World Tour of Australia&quot;. By the late 1980s, Connolly had all but dropped the music from his act, though he still records the occasional musical performance, such as a 1980s recording of his composition &quot;Sergeant, Where&#x27;s Mine?&quot; with the Dubliners. In 1998, he covered the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; on the George Martin tribute album &quot;In My Life&quot;. He sang the Scottish folk song &quot;Bonnie George Campbell&quot; during the film &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. In 1995 and 2005, he released two albums of instrumental performances, &quot;Musical Tour of Scotland&quot; and, &quot;Billy Connolly&#x27;s Musical Tour of New Zealand&quot;, respectively.

Connolly is among the artists featured on &quot;Banjoman&quot;, a tribute to American folk musician Derroll Adams, released in 2002. He played one song, &quot;The Rock&quot;.

=== Stand-up comedy ===
Connolly&#x27;s observational comedy is idiosyncratic and often off-the-cuff. He has offended certain sectors of audiences, critics and the media with his free use of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, and he has made jokes relating to masturbation, blasphemy, defecation, flatulence, hemorrhoids, sex, his father&#x27;s illness, his aunts&#x27; cruelty and, in the latter stages of his career, old age (specifically his experiences of growing old).

In 2007 and again in 2010, he was voted the greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups. He once again topped the list on Channel 5&#x27;s Greatest Stand-Up Comedians, broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2013.

Since the 1980s, Connolly has worn a custom-made black T-shirt with a shirt-tail as part of his on-stage attire. Steve Brown was his manager from 1986 until his death in 2017.

=== Comics writing ===
Between 1973 and 1977, Connolly wrote a newspaper gag-a-day comic with cartoonist Malky McCormick, titled &quot;The Big Yin&quot;.

=== Art ===
Connolly has published eleven collections of his art. His method is similar to that of the Surrealist Automatism movement, whereby the artist allows their hand to move randomly across the paper or canvas without a specific intent. In April 2019, to celebrate World Parkinson&#x27;s Day, his art was projected onto MacLellan&#x27;s Castle in Kirkcudbright. His first sculpture, which is inspired by his past as a welder, was released in March 2020. He spoke about his art and the inspiration behind it on the occasion of his 80th birthday in 2022.

<text>During the Spanish–American War of 1898, Cámara&#x27;s Flying Relief Column was a naval task force of Spain&#x27;s most powerful warships, under the command of Rear Admiral Manuel de la Cámara, tasked with relieving Spanish forces in Manila after the defeat of Spanish Pacific Squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón by the American Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898. The Spanish fleet, consisting of the battleship &quot;Pelayo&quot;, armored cruiser &quot;Emperador Carlos V&quot;, auxiliary cruisers &quot;Patriota&quot; and &quot;Rapido&quot;, destroyers &quot;Audaz&quot;, &quot;Osado&quot;, and &quot;Prosepina&quot;, and transports &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; and &quot;Panay&quot;, left Spain in June 1898. The squadron was far more powerful than that commanded by Dewey, which only consisted of four protected cruisers and two gunboats. The monitor had been ordered from the U.S. to the Philippines, and departed on 11 June.

With the bulk of the Spanish Navy heading to the Pacific, the U.S. made plans for battleships &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot; and the cruiser USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to raid and bombard Spanish ports. But, following the destruction of the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, Cámara&#x27;s column was ordered to return to Spain to defend the Spanish coast. On 7 July, after arriving in Egypt, Cámara&#x27;s fleet turned home, and the American battleships never left the Caribbean.

<text>The Centrophoridae are a family of squaliform sharks. The family contains just two genera and about 15 species. They are sometimes called gulper sharks, but this is also the name of a specific species in the family, &quot;Centrophorus granulosus&quot;.
These are generally deepwater fish. While some, such as the gulper shark &quot;C. granulosus&quot;, are found worldwide and fished commercially, others are uncommon and little-known. Their usual prey is other fish; some are known to feed on squid, octopus, and shrimp. Some species live on the bottom (benthic), while others are pelagic. They are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the egg-cases in her body until they hatch.

They are small to medium sharks, ranging from in adult body length. The members of the genus &quot;Deania&quot; generally have a long flattened snout.

==Species==
The 18 known species are grouped into two genera:

* &quot;Centrophorus&quot; 
** &quot;Centrophorus atromarginatus&quot; (dwarf gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus granulosus&quot; . (gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus harrissoni&quot; (dumb gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus isodon&quot; (blackfin gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus lusitanicus&quot; (lowfin gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus moluccensis&quot; (smallfin gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus seychellorum&quot; (Seychelles gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus squamosus&quot; (leafscale gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus tessellatus&quot; (mosaic gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus uyato&quot; (Little gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus westraliensis&quot; (western gulper shark)
** &quot;Centrophorus zeehaani&quot; (southern dogfish)
** &quot;Centrophorus&quot; sp. A (minigulper)
** &quot;Centrophorus&quot; sp. B (slender gulper)
* &quot;Deania&quot; 
** &quot;Deania calcea&quot; (birdbeak dogfish)
** &quot;Deania hystricosa&quot; (rough longnose dogfish)
** &quot;Deania profundorum&quot; (arrowhead dogfish)
** &quot;Deania quadrispinosa&quot; (longsnout dogfish)

<text>Keith Wright (born June 8, 1980) is a former American football defensive tackle.

==Biography==
Wright graduated at 17 and went to Arizona Western college, where he stayed for 2 years before moving on to Sacramento City College in 1999. There, he had a total of 14 sacks during one season. Later he had 68 tackles in his first season at Missouri. Then, he was moved to defensive tackle at the Missouri team, and he was able to complete 92 tackles in 2002. With that, he expected to be chosen in the third or fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft.

Wright was drafted by the Houston Texans as the final pick of the sixth round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He signed a contract worth $925,000 for the seasons from 2003 to 2005.

On November 10, 2003, Wright was signed as a free agent from the Texans practice squad by the Indianapolis Colts.

On November 24, 2004, Wright was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their practice squad and released on July 27, 2005.

The Arizona Cardinals signed Wright to a one-year contract on August 5, 2005, but subsequently released him on August 29.

The Buccaneers signed him as a free agent in January 2006 and assigned him to NFL Europe. He was released on September 2, 2006, and signed to the Detroit Lions practice squad on October 18.

On August 29, 2011, Wright was arrested on suspicion of home invasion and sexual assault in the Natomas neighborhood of Sacramento, California. He was linked to three home invasions that took place in July and August 2011. During one of them, he sexually assaulted a woman and forced her to pull money out of two ATMs.

In October 2012, Wright was convicted on 19 charges including armed robbery, kidnapping, forced oral copulation, first degree burglary, and false imprisonment. On November 30, he was sentenced to 234 years and 8 months in prison.

<doc id="251020" wikidata="Q2562509" url="?curid=251020" title="Battle of Fuzhou">
<text>The Battle of Fuzhou, or Battle of Foochow, also known as the Battle of the Pagoda Anchorage (French: Combat naval de Fou-Tchéou, Chinese: , 馬江之役 or 馬尾海戰, literally Battle of Mawei), was the opening engagement of the 16-month Sino-French War (December 1883 – April 1885). The battle was fought on 23 August 1884 off the Pagoda Anchorage in Mawei () harbour, to the southeast of the city of Fuzhou (Foochow). During the battle Admiral Amédée Courbet&#x27;s Far East Squadron virtually destroyed the Fujian Fleet, one of China&#x27;s four regional fleets.

==Background==
On 11 May 1884 French and Chinese negotiators concluded the Tientsin Accord, an agreement designed to end several months of undeclared hostilities between France and China in Tonkin. On 23 June 1884, French troops advancing to occupy Lạng Sơn, in accordance with the terms of this agreement, clashed near the small town of Bắc Lệ with a detachment of the Chinese Guangxi Army. The Chinese opened fire on the advancing French, precipitating a two-day battle in which the French column was seriously mauled. This incident, the Bắc Lệ ambush, was the proximate cause of the Sino-French War.

When news of the Bắc Lệ ambush reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Jules Ferry&#x27;s government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tianjin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay an indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Courbet was ordered to take his squadron to Fuzhou (Foochow).

Courbet was instructed to prepare to destroy the Foochow Navy Yard, downriver from Fuzhou at Mawei, and to attack the Chinese fleet in Mawei harbour. Ironically, the Foochow Navy Yard represented a substantial French investment in China&#x27;s future, having been built several years earlier under the direction of the French administrator Prosper Giquel. During the second half of July and the first half of August Courbet gradually concentrated his squadron in Mawei harbour, at the Pagoda Anchorage—named for a conspicuous Chinese pagoda, the Luoxingta (), which stood on a hill above the harbour.

Negotiations between France and China broke down in mid-August, and on the evening of 22 August Courbet was authorised by the French government to commence hostilities. He duly notified the foreign consuls, the governor-general of Fujian and Zhejiang, and the commanders of several neutral warships moored at the Pagoda Anchorage (the British gunboats , and and the American corvette ).

==Order of battle==
Only a fraction of the Far East squadron was present off the Pagoda Anchorage on the morning of 23 August. In particular, none of the Far East squadron&#x27;s four ironclads was immediately available. &quot;Bayard&quot;, Courbet&#x27;s flagship, was at Sharp Peak near the island of Matsu, guarding a vital telegraph station. &quot;Atalante&quot; was hunting down pirate ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. Courbet had summoned the ironclads &quot;Triomphante&quot; from Shanghai and &quot;La Galissonnière&quot; from Keelung to join him off Fuzhou, but &quot;La Galissonnière&quot; had been detained at Keelung by bad weather, and although &quot;Triomphante&quot; was approaching the Min River, it was not clear whether she would be able to cross the bar at its entrance.

Courbet had under his immediate command the first-class cruisers &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, &quot;Villars&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Estaing&quot;, the third-class cruiser &quot;Volta&quot; (which he chose as his flagship during the engagement), the gunboats &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Aspic&quot; and &quot;Vipère&quot; and Torpedo Boats No. 45 and No. 46. The second-class cruiser &quot;Châteaurenault&quot; and the troopship &quot;Saône&quot; had been left at the Jinpai pass, at the entrance to the Min River, to stop the Chinese from laying a barrage to prevent the squadron&#x27;s escape.

The Chinese Fujian fleet consisted of the wooden corvette &quot;Yangwu&quot; (the flagship), the scout-transports &quot;Chenhang&quot;, &quot;Yongbao&quot;, &quot;Fupo&quot;, &quot;Feiyun&quot; and &quot;Ji&#x27;an&quot;, the paddle steamer &quot;Yixin&quot;, the wooden gunboats &quot;Zhenwei&quot; and , and the Rendel flatiron gunboats &quot;Fusheng&quot; and &quot;Jiansheng&quot;. Twelve large junks were nearby, but did not take part in the battle. The French squadron displaced 14,500 tons and included 1,780 men, while the eleven warships in the Chinese fleet displaced 8,000 tons, and included 1,040 men. The French squadron was much better-led and better-armed than the Chinese fleet. Only a few of the Chinese ships were capable of offering serious resistance to Courbet&#x27;s attack. The Chinese defence was under the command of the imperial commissioner Zhang Peilun (), one of the leading members of China&#x27;s war party.

==Fleet deployments==

The Chinese fleet was deployed into a northern group of eight ships and a southern group of three ships, with the French squadron lying in between. The wooden corvette &quot;Yangwu&quot;, the wooden gunboat &quot;Fuxing&quot;, the armed transport &quot;Fupo&quot;, the Rendel flatiron gunboats &quot;Jiansheng&quot; and &quot;Fusheng&quot; and the small paddle steamer &quot;Yixin&quot; were deployed on the northwest curve of the river, between the French ships and the Foochow Navy Yard. A little behind them lay the unarmed transports &quot;Yongbao&quot; and &quot;Chenhang&quot;, anchored just off the dockyard. The role of this northern group of ships was obviously to prevent the French from attacking the Navy Yard. Meanwhile, the armed wooden transports &quot;Ji&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Feiyun&quot; and the wooden gunboat &quot;Zhenwei&quot; lay downstream of the French squadron, dangerously isolated on the southwesterly leg of the river, in front of the Customs building. Their job seems to have been to protect the Customs building and to block Courbet&#x27;s exit from the Min River.

Courbet&#x27;s plan provided for overwhelming firepower to be deployed against the Chinese fleet. He had noticed that the Chinese ships swung with the tide, and determined to make his attack just before the top of the tide at 2:00 pm on the following afternoon, Saturday 23 August, when with luck the Chinese ships would have swung away from the French ships and would be presenting their vulnerable sterns to the attackers. This timing was also important for another reason. If &quot;Triomphante&quot; successfully ascended the Min River, it was about then that she would be making her appearance.
Assuming that the Chinese fleet did not change its position, Courbet&#x27;s orders provided for the French ships to be at action stations at 1:45 pm and to go into action at around 2:00 pm, on his signal. The battle would begin with an attack by Torpedo Boats No. 45 and No. 46 on &quot;Yangwu&quot; and &quot;Fupo&quot;. This attack would be supported by cannon and rifle fire from &quot;Volta&quot;. &quot;Volta&quot; would then concentrate on destroying a line of war junks and fireships drawn up just to the west of Losing Island. Once the attack by the torpedo boats had cleared the way, the gunboats &quot;Aspic&quot;, &quot;Vipère&quot; and &quot;Lynx&quot; would sail upriver towards the Navy Yard and take on the other ships of the Chinese northern group. Four steam launches under the command of &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, the future French admiral, were given the job of protecting &quot;Volta&quot; and the three French gunboats from attack by the Chinese mineboats. To the east &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, &quot;Villars&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Estaing&quot; were to reduce the three ships of the Chinese southern group, to engage the war junks from the flank, and to engage a battery armed with three Krupp cannon near the Pagoda, and three other batteries armed with Krupp cannon which protected the Arsenal. Their launches would be deployed to give protection against Chinese torpedo attacks.

==The battle of Fuzhou==
On the morning of Saturday 23 August, although the Chinese commanders knew that the French would launch their attack at around 2:00 pm, the sailors in both fleets went about their routine business. The ships of the Fujian Fleet made no attempt to redeploy or to anticipate the French attack by opening fire first. The French crews went to their action stations at 1:30 pm, after eating their midday meal. The Chinese did not react to this obvious threat, and at 1:45 pm the flurry of activity aboard the French ships died down. For the next ten minutes the tension grew aboard the French ships as the minutes ticked away towards 2:00 pm. At 1:55 pm a Chinese mineboat advanced towards the French squadron. Courbet immediately ordered the attack to begin, only five minutes short of his original timetable.

At the outset of the battle the Chinese flagship &quot;Yangwu&quot; was successfully attacked with a spar torpedo by Torpedo Boat No.46 (&quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Douzans) and grounded. The French torpedo boat suffered damage to her boiler during this attack. The despatch vessel &quot;Fupo&quot; was attacked less successfully by Torpedo Boat No.45 (&quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Latour), and was subsequently crippled by &quot;Volta&quot;&#x27;s torpedo launch and carried by boarding by Boué de Lapeyrère&#x27;s sailors. She had already been set alight by French shellfire, and was eventually abandoned by the French prize crew and sank in the middle of the Min River.

Their spar torpedoes expended, the two French torpedo boats drifted downriver after making their attack, towards the anchorage of the neutral vessels off Losing Island. Lieutenant Latour had been seriously wounded in the eye during the attack, but he refused an offer of medical assistance from American officers on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, explaining that he could not leave his post while the battle was still in progress.

Meanwhile, the French cruisers and the ironclad &quot;Triomphante&quot;, which joined the French squadron only minutes before the battle began, were making short work of the rest of the Chinese fleet. &quot;Chenhang&quot;, &quot;Yongbao&quot;, &quot;Feiyun&quot;, &quot;Ji&#x27;an&quot;, &quot;Fusheng&quot; and &quot;Jiansheng&quot; were either sunk or set alight by shellfire from the cruisers &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, &quot;Villars&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Estaing&quot;. Only &quot;Fupo&quot; and &quot;Yixin&quot; survived the battle without serious damage, by escaping upriver before the gunboats &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Aspic&quot; and &quot;Vipère&quot; had a chance to engage them. &quot;Zhenwei&quot; was blown up by a single shell from &quot;Triomphante&quot;.

Before they were put out of action the outgunned Chinese vessels concentrated their fire on the French flagship &quot;Volta&quot;, hoping to kill Courbet and the officers of his entourage. Several sailors aboard the French cruiser were killed or wounded, and shortly after the start of the battle a roundshot ploughed through Courbet&#x27;s command group on the flagship&#x27;s bridge, killing the British pilot Thomas and only narrowly missing &quot;capitaine de frégate&quot; Gigon, &quot;Volta&quot;&#x27;s captain. A few minutes later splinters from an exploding Chinese shell wounded &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Ravel, Courbet&#x27;s aide-de-camp.

The fighting ended at 5:00pm, but during the night of 23August the Chinese made a number of unsuccessful attacks with fireships on the French warships, obliging some of them to shift their anchorages to evade them.

==Bombardment of the Foochow Navy Yard==
On the morning of 24 August Courbet issued orders for his ships&#x27; landing companies to go ashore with the naval engineers to destroy the Foochow Navy Yard. Preparations were made for a landing, but Courbet then changed his mind, after observing that the Navy Yard was defended by organised groups of Chinese infantry. The attack was cancelled as the French sailors were on the point of climbing into their launches.

Instead, the French bombarded the Foochow Navy Yard, damaging a number of outbuildings and holing the sloop &quot;Henghai&quot; (&quot;Heng-hai&quot;, 橫海), still under construction and lying on the slips. A certain amount of damage was inflicted, but without the support of the heavy guns of &quot;Triomphante&quot; and &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; or the slightly lighter guns of the cruisers &quot;Villars&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Estaing&quot;, which drew too much water to enter the shallows off the Navy Yard except around high tide, Courbet was unable to destroy the Yard completely. He himself admitted in his official report that the damage done &#x27;was not as much as I had hoped for&#x27;.

The French squadron remained off Fuzhou during the night of 24 August. Once again the Chinese tried to make a night attack. At 4:00 am two Chinese torpedo launches tried to attack the gunboat &quot;Vipère&quot;, anchored at the head of the French line. Both launches were lit up by searchlights on the French ships and attacked with Hotchkiss fire by &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;. One launch was sunk instantly, while the crew of the other abandoned ship and swam for the shore.

==Descent of the Min River==
On 25 August, after receiving the congratulations of the captains of the neutral warships on the professionalism displayed by the French squadron during the action of 23 August, Courbet began to lead his ships back down the Min River. The squadron&#x27;s two heaviest ships, &quot;Triomphante&quot; and &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, led the way.

On 25 and 26 August the French bombarded the Tianluowan () and Min&#x27;an () batteries, two Chinese shore batteries covering the approach to Fuzhou through the narrow Min&#x27;an Pass. The Chinese batteries, built to fire only on enemy ships approaching from the mouth of the river, were taken in reverse and destroyed by &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; and &quot;Triomphante&quot;.

On 27 and 28 August the French squadron bombarded and destroyed the Chinese defences at the Jinpai pass near the entrance to the Min River. The Jinpai () and Changmen () batteries, known to the French as Fort Kimpai and the White Fort (Fort Blanc), were put out of action, and the French also inflicted heavy casualties on a number of Chinese field batteries and infantry formations. However, before its guns were destroyed the White Fort was able to inflict moderate damage on the French ironclad &quot;La Galissonnière&quot;, which had sailed up from Keelung to join Courbet&#x27;s squadron and attempted unsuccessfully to fight its way into the Min River. Chinese infantry at the Jinpai pass also killed and wounded several French sailors aboard the gunboat &quot;Vipère&quot; on 27 August.

==Losses==
The losses of the French squadron in the course of the operations before Fuzhou and in the Min River were relatively light (10 dead and 48 wounded). Most of these casualties were inflicted not by shellfire during the engagement of 23 August but by sniper fire from Chinese infantry during the squadron&#x27;s descent of the Min River. The French dead included &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Bouët-Willaumez, second-in-command of the gunboat &quot;Vipère&quot; and son of the noted French admiral Louis-Édouard Bouët-Willaumez (1809–71), who was shot dead on &quot;Vipère&quot;&#x27;s bridge during an exchange of fire with the defenders of Fort Kimpai on 27 August. With the exception of &quot;La Galissonnière&quot; and Torpedo Boat No. 46, none of Courbet&#x27;s vessels suffered serious damage.

The Chinese lost nine of the eleven ships of the Fujian Fleet. Some of the Chinese ships foundered where they were struck, sinking off the Pagoda anchorage and the Foochow Navy Yard. Others drifted downriver and either ran aground or sank between Losing Island and the Min&#x27;an pass. French officers aboard &quot;Châteaurenault&quot;, anchored near the entrance to the Min River, saw three Chinese warships drifting downriver on the evening of 23 August, abandoned by their crews and blazing from stem to stern. One of the Chinese ships exploded in front of their eyes.

Courbet estimated Chinese casualties at between 2,000 and 3,000 dead. The commemorative tablets in a shrine erected shortly after the war at the Pagoda Anchorage to honour the Chinese dead list the names of 831 sailors and soldiers killed on 23 August, but this list does not include the hundreds of Chinese soldiers killed by the French during their descent of the Min River.

The Chinese imperial commissioner Zhang Peilun, who made no serious attempt to coordinate the resistance of the Fujian fleet, was degraded after the battle and replaced by the veteran general Zuo Zongtang (). He Jing (), the governor-general of Fujian and Zhejiang, Zhang Zhaotong (), the governor of Fujian, and He Ruzhang (), the director-general of the Foochow Navy Yard, were also degraded. The Manchu General of Fuzhou Mutušan (), who had directed the defence of the Jinpai pass on 27 and 28 August with skill and energy, kept his job.

The Cantonese naval officer Zhang Cheng (), a graduate of the Foochow naval college and captain of the Chinese flagship &quot;Yangwu&quot;, abandoned ship as soon as the battle started and was later beheaded for cowardice.

==Factors in the French victory==
One of the factors in the French victory at Fuzhou was that the French squadron had sailed up the Min River in time of peace. The Chinese claimed after the battle, with some justification, that the French would never have been able to ascend the river if the two countries had been at war. A second important factor was the absence from the battle of the modern battleships &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;, which had recently been completed in Germany for China&#x27;s Beiyang Fleet (Northern Seas fleet). The Chinese battleships were more powerful than any of the ships under Courbet&#x27;s command, and in December 1883, foreseeing that war with China was imminent, the French persuaded the German government to detain them in the event of hostilities. The German government invented a number of plausible excuses for keeping the two battleships in port, and they remained in Germany for the duration of the Sino-French War. They were finally released in July 1885, and joined the Northern Seas fleet in October of the same year.

Some Chinese historians have asserted that disunity in the Chinese command structure was an important factor in the Chinese defeat. The Chinese regional fleets and armies represented a considerable &#x27;personal&#x27; investment of revenue and prestige that was used to leverage influence at court, and the respective fleet commanders were often loath to see these important assets diminished by war damage. The result, at Fuzhou, was that the Fujian Fleet received little help from China&#x27;s three other regional fleets. Despite appeals from Zhang Peilun and direct orders from the Empress Dowager Cixi, the commanders of the Beiyang Fleet, the Nanyang Fleet and the Guangdong Fleet declined to send ships to reinforce the Fujian Fleet. &quot;Feiyun&quot; and &quot;Ji&#x27;an&quot;, two Fujian vessels which had been loaned to the Guangdong Fleet in 1882 to observe French movements in the Gulf of Tonkin, were sent back to Fuzhou in early August by Zhang Zhidong, the governor-general of the two Guangs, arriving just in time to share the fate of their comrades in the forthcoming battle. However, Zhang did not release any of his own Guangdong ships. Li Hongzhang defied an order to send two ships from the Beiyang Fleet to Fuzhou, and the Zhejiang governor Liu Bingzhang () refused to release the Nanyang ship &quot;Chaowu&quot;.

<doc id="251023" wikidata="Q590060" url="?curid=251023" title="Guaynabo, Puerto Rico">
<text>Guaynabo (, ) is a city and municipality on the northeastern coastal plain of Puerto Rico. Located west of the capital San Juan, east of Bayamón, south of Cataño and San Juan Bay, and north of Aguas Buenas, Guaynabo is spread over 9 barrios and the downtown area and administrative center of Guaynabo Pueblo. With a land area of and a population of 89,780 as of the 2020 census, it is part of the San Juan metropolitan area. The studios of WAPA-TV, the most watched television station in Puerto Rico, are located in Guaynabo.

==History==
The first European settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra, was founded in 1508 by Juan Ponce de León in land that is today part of Guaynabo. Ponce de León resided there as first Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. This settlement was abandoned in 1521 in favor of San Juan. The ruins of Caparra remain and are a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico, which features artifacts from the site and others in Puerto Rico, is located on the grounds.

The municipality of Guaynabo was founded in 1769 by Pedro R. Davila (P.R.), after a struggle for division from the municipality of Bayamón. Previously, the municipality was known as Buinabo, a name that it is popularly said to mean in Taíno &quot;Here is another place of fresh water.&quot; Irish officer Thomas O&#x27;Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan settled the area in the late 18th century and developed a farm and sugarcane plantation he named Hacienda San Patricio. The plantation no longer exists but the land on which it was located is now the central business district of Guaynabo and the San Patricio Plaza shopping mall.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Guaynabo, where 26.9% of the population live below the poverty level, 2800 homes were destroyed. The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Guaynabo. Then president Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump visited Guaynabo. Due to the municipality&#x27;s fiscal difficulties, it was not until April 2, 2019, over a year and half later, that the overtime pay owed to municipal workers was paid.

After 24 years as mayor, Héctor O&#x27;Neill García resigned in 2017 when allegations surfaced of sexual harassment toward a female municipal employee. He was replaced in a run-off election by Angel Pérez Otero, who in turn was forced out due to his arrest for Federal corruption allegations in 2021. Héctor O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s son Edward O&#x27;Neill Rosa won the following run-off election to succeed him as mayor in January 2022.

==Geography==
Guaynabo is on the northern side.

===Barrios===
Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guaynabo is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a smaller barrio referred to as , located near the center of the municipality.

#Camarones
#Frailes
#Guaraguao
#Guaynabo barrio-pueblo
#Hato Nuevo
#Mamey
#Pueblo Viejo
#Río
#Santa Rosa
#Sonadora


===Sectors===

Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Guaynabo: Amelia, Buen Samaritano, Camarones barrio, Corea, El Polvorín, Honduras, Jerusalén, Los Filtros, Sector El Laberinto, Sector La Pajilla, Sector Los Ratones (Camino Feliciano), Sector San Miguel, Trujillo, Sector Tomé, Vietnam, and Villa Isleña.

==Demographics==
==Tourism==
To stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the &quot;Voy Turistiendo&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Touring&quot;) campaign, with a passport book and website. The Guaynabo page lists , , and , as places of interest.

<doc id="251024" wikidata="Q1050303" url="?curid=251024" title="Downtown">
<text>Downtown is a term primarily used in American and Canadian English to refer to a city&#x27;s sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political, and geographic heart. It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD). It may also be a center for shopping and entertainment. Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city&#x27;s employment but are concentrated in services, including high-end services (office or white-collar jobs). Sometimes, smaller downtowns include lower population densities and nearby lower incomes than suburbs. It is often distinguished as a hub of public transit and culture.

==History==

===Origins===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&#x27;s first citation for &quot;down town&quot; or &quot;downtown&quot; dates to 1770, in reference to the center of Boston. Some have posited that the term &quot;downtown&quot; was coined in New York City, where it was in use by the 1830s to refer to the original settlement, or town, at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan. As the town of New York grew into a city, the only direction it could grow on the island was toward the north, proceeding upriver from the original settlement, the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; terminology coming from the customary map design in which up was north and down was south. Thus, anything north of the original town became known as &quot;uptown&quot; (Upper Manhattan), and was generally a residential area, while the original town – which was also New York&#x27;s only major center of business at the time – became known as &quot;downtown&quot; (Lower Manhattan).

During the late 19th century, the term was gradually adopted by cities across the United States to refer to the historical core of the city, which was most often the same as the commercial heart of the city. &quot;Uptown&quot; also spread, but to a much lesser extent. In both cases, though, the directionality of both words was lost, so that a Bostonian might refer to going &quot;downtown&quot;, even though it was north of where they were. Downtown lay to the south in Detroit, but to the north in Cleveland, to the east in St. Louis, and to the west in Pittsburgh. In Boston, a resident pointed out in 1880, downtown was in the center of the city. Uptown was north of downtown in Cincinnati, but south of downtown in New Orleans and San Francisco.

Notably, &quot;downtown&quot; was not included in dictionaries as late as the 1880s. But by the early 1900s, &quot;downtown&quot; was clearly established as the proper term in American English for a city&#x27;s central business district, although the word was virtually unknown in Britain and Western Europe, where expressions such as &quot;city centre&quot; (British English), &quot;el centro&quot; (Spanish), &quot;das Zentrum&quot; (German), etc are used. Even as late as the early part of the 20th century, English travel writers felt it necessary to explain to their readers what &quot;downtown&quot; meant.

Although American downtowns lacked legally-defined boundaries, and were often parts of several of the wards that most cities used as their basic functional district, locating the downtown area was not difficult, as it was the place where all the street railways and elevated railways converged, and – at least in most places – where the railroad terminals were. It was the location of the great department stores and hotels, as well as that of theaters, clubs, cabarets, and dance halls, and where skyscrapers were built once that technology was perfected. It was also frequently, at first, the only part of a city that was electrified. It was also the place where street congestion was the worst, a problem for which a solution was never really found.

But most of all, downtown was the place where the city did its business. Inside its small precincts, sometimes as small as several hundred acres, the majority of the trading, selling, and purchasing – retail and wholesale – in the entire area would take place. There were hubs of business in other places around the city and its environs, but the downtown area was the chief one, truly the central business district. And as more and more business was done downtown, those who had their homes there were gradually pushed out, selling their property and moving to quieter residential areas uptown.

===Skyscrapers===
The skyscraper would become the hallmark of the downtown area. Prior to the invention of the elevator – and later the high-speed elevator – buildings were limited in height to about six stories, which was a &quot;de facto&quot; limit set by the amount of stairs it was assumed that people would climb, but with the elevator, that limit was shattered, and buildings began to be constructed up to about sixteen stories. What limited them then was the thickness of the masonry needed at the base to hold the weight of the building above it. As the buildings got taller, the thickness of the masonry and the space needed for elevators did not allow for sufficient rentable space to make the building profitable. What shattered that restriction was the invention of first the iron- and then the steel frame building, in which the building&#x27;s load was carried by an internal metal frame skeleton, from which the masonry – and later glass – simply hung, without carrying any weight.

Although first used in Chicago, the steel-framed skyscraper caught on most quickly in New York City in the 1880s, and from there spread to most other American cities in the 1890s and 1900s. The apparent lack of a height limitation of this type of building set off a fervent debate over whether their height should be restricted by law, with proponents and opponents of height limits bringing out numerous arguments in favor of their position. The question of height limits also had a profound implication for the nature of downtown itself: would it continue to be a concentrated core, or as it grew, would height limits force it to spread out into a larger area. In the short run, the proponents of height limits were successful in their efforts. By the 1910s, most of the large and medium-sized cities had height limits in effect, although New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Minneapolis were notable exceptions. 


===Zoning===
Ultimately, it was not simple height limits that restricted skyscrapers, but they were limited by comprehensive zoning laws which set up separate requirements for different parts of a city. Zoning rules would regulate not only height, but also a building&#x27;s volume, the percentage of the lot used, and the amount of light the building blocked. Zoning regulations sometimes encouraged setbacks (step-like recessions in the outer wall, making higher-up segments of the building progressively narrower than the base) to reduce a building&#x27;s bulk by allowing additional height per foot of setback – the exact amount depending on what zone the building was in. The ultimate effect of setbacks is to increase the sunlight and visible sky at street level. New York City was the first to do this, with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was prompted in large part by the construction of the Equitable Building in 1915. The Equitable Building was a 40-story building with straight sides and no setbacks, which raised fears of the downtown area becoming a maze of dark streets that never saw the sun. Worse yet, at least from a real estate perspective, this new building created 1.2 million square feet (111,000 m2) of office space, flooding into what was already a sluggish market. To many in the real estate industry, the zoning law was an example of a &quot;reasonable restriction.&quot;

Once New York had passed its law, other cities followed, although proposed zoning measures did meet stiff resistance in some places, often because of the inclusion of overly restrictive height limits, and sometimes because the entire concept of zoning was seen as undemocratic and bordering on socialism. Eventually, a model law, the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act of 1922 was drawn up for the guidance of cities wishing to enact zoning regulations, which are now part of virtually every American city.

===Central business district===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the downtown area was &quot;the&quot; business district of the American city, but beginning around the 1920s and 1930s, as cities continued to grow in size and population, rival business districts began to appear outside of downtown in outlying districts. This was the time when the term &quot;central business district&quot; began to appear as more-or-less synonymous with the downtown area. The phrase acknowledged the existence of other business districts in the city, but allocated to downtown the primacy of being &quot;central&quot;, not only geographically, in many cities, but also in importance. And in many cases, the downtown area or central business district, itself began to grow, such as in Manhattan where the business district lower Manhattan and the newer one in midtown began to grow towards each other, or in Chicago, where downtown expanded from the Loop across the Chicago River to Michigan Avenue. In fact, the instability of downtown was a cause for concern for business and real estate interests, as the business district refused to stay where it had been, and shifted its location in response to numerous factors, although it generally stayed fairly compact – in the early 1930s even the largest took up less than 2% of the city&#x27;s space, and most were significantly smaller – and remained the primary business district of the city.

Real estate interests were particularly concerned about the tendency of downtown to move because the downtown area had by far the highest land values in each city. One commentator said that if Chicago&#x27;s land values were shown as height on a relief map, the Loop would be equivalent to the peaks of the Himalayas compared to the rest of the city. In 1926, Chicago&#x27;s central business district, which took up less than 1% of the city, had 20% of the city&#x27;s land value. The same relationship was true in St. Louis in the mid-20s (20%) and Los Angeles in the early 1930s (17%). So when a downtown area started to shift its location, some property owners were bound to lose a great deal of money, while others would stand to gain.

===Decentralization===
One way in which downtown changed from the late 19th century to the early part of the 20th century was that industrial concerns began to leave downtown and move to the periphery of the city, which meant that downtown&#x27;s businesses were chiefly part of the burgeoning service sector. Brand new firms followed the older ones, and never came to downtown, settling at the edges of the city or the urban area. Industrial districts developed in these areas, which were sometimes specifically zoned for manufacturing. There, land was considerably cheaper than downtown, property taxes were lower, transportation of supplies and finished products was much easier without the constant congestion emblematic of downtown, and with the improvement of the telephone system, the industrial firms could still keep in touch with the companies they did business with elsewhere. As a result of this migration, manufacturing was no longer a significant part of the downtown mix of businesses.

Another sector which began to move away from downtown even before the turn of the 20th century were the great cultural institutions: museums, symphony halls, main libraries and so on. Not only was the high cost of land downtown a factor, but these institutions wanted larger plots of land than were available there, so that their buildings could themselves be easily perceived as works of art. Organizations such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the City of New York, all in Manhattan, moved out of downtown, as did the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Public Library, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Detroit Public Library and the Detroit Institute of Art, and most of the cultural institutions in Pittsburgh. Public reaction to these moves was mixed, with some bemoaning the loss of a counterbalance to the overall materialism of downtown, while others, particularly those involved in real estate, looked positively on the availability of the land which the cultural institutions left behind.


The loss of the major cultural institutions left downtown as a place primarily dedicated to business, but the loss of another sector, retail shopping, defined the &quot;type&quot; of business that was done there. The great retail outlets like the department stores had always had the tendency to move closer to the residential districts, to make it easier for their customers to get to them, but after 1920 they started to congregate in secondary business districts on the periphery of the city. The growth of chain stores such as J. C. Penney, F. W. Woolworth, Kresge and W. T. Grant, contributed to the increased importance of the outlying shopping districts, which began outselling those retail stores which had remained in the central business district, and provoked those stores to open branches in the secondary districts in attempt to go to where there customers were instead of having them come downtown to them.

Entertainment venues also contributed to the decentralization of commerce which affected the importance and influence of downtown and the central business district. Theaters, vaudeville houses, dance halls and night clubs had been primarily located in downtown, with nickelodeons spread throughout the city. When film became the dominant medium, and exhibitors started to build movie theaters to show them in, they at first built those venues downtown as well, but, as in retail shopping, chain exhibitors such as Loews began to construct them in locations convenient to the mass audience they were seeking; again, it was a matter of bringing their product to where the people were. By the late 1920s, movie houses outside of downtown far outnumbered those in the central district. Not all the movie theaters in the periphery were palaces, but some were, and the net effect was that downtown was no longer the entertainment center of the city.

With the loss of manufacturing, the major cultural institutions, much of the retail shopping in the city, and its loss of status as the entertainment center, the nature of downtown had changed considerably. It was still the location of banks, stocks and commodity exchanges, law and accounting firms, the headquarters of the major industrial concerns and public utilities, insurance companies, and advertising agencies, and in its confines continued to be built new and taller skyscrapers housing offices, hotels and even department stores, but it was still steadily losing ground as decentralization took its toll. Its daytime population was not keeping pace with the population growth of the city around it, and property values, while continuing to rise, were not rising as fast as those in the secondary business districts. Downtown was still the central business district, and was still the most important area for doing business and commerce, but it was no longer as dominant as it once was.

====Cause and effect====
The causes of decentralization, which decreased the importance of downtown in the life of American cities, have been ascribed to many factors, including each city&#x27;s normal growth patterns; advances in technology like the telephone, which made it easier for business-to-business intercourse to take place over a distance, thus lessening the need for a centralized commercial core; the rise of the private automobile, which allowed shoppers to go to peripheral business districts more easily; a strong increase in streetcar fares; and the continuing problem of congestion in the narrow streets of the downtown area.

As much as people disagreed about what caused decentralization, they were even less in agreement about how decentralization would affect the central business district, with opinions varying all the way from the belief that it would diminish downtown sufficiently that it would eventually consist of only offices and the headquarters of corporate giants, to the belief that decentralization would lead to the (perhaps deserved) death of downtown entirely as unnecessary, a victim of its untameable traffic congestion. In between were those who saw a diminishment of the area&#x27;s influence, but not enough to prevent it from remaining the &quot;Sun&quot; that the outlying business districts revolved around. Others doubted whether decentralization had as strong an impact as it was credited with. Positions were taken that downtown was a natural part of the evolution of a city, or the unnatural result of a &quot;de facto&quot; conspiracy by merchants and property owners, so the question of what decentralization would do to downtown became bound up with the question about the area&#x27;s legitimacy.

Decentralization also increased the incidences of rivalry between downtown and burgeoning business districts. In Los Angeles, for instance, downtown and Wilshire Boulevard battled for dominance, and in Cincinnati the rivalry was between the old downtown centered around Fountain Square and the one on Canal Street. The diminishment of downtown by decentralization caused these battles to be between areas that were now more relatively equal.

===The Great Depression===
Like almost every other aspect of American life, the Great Depression had a major effect on the country&#x27;s downtown area. Downtown was just coming off a major building boom, in which significant amounts of new commercial and office space, hotels, and department stores had been built. By 1931 there were 89 buildings of 30 stories or more in Manhattan, and between 1925 and 1931, office space nearly doubled; in Chicago, it increased by almost 75%, in Philadelphia by almost two-thirds, and by more than 50% in New Orleans and Denver. In the 1920s, 500,000 additional hotel rooms were built in New York, and from 1927 to 1931 there were 84 large hotels built there, an increase of hotel space by two-thirds.

When the boom was over, and the Depression had begun to have its effect, much of this new space became unneeded excess. Owners of smaller buildings who could not keep a sufficient number of tenants to pay their overhead, tore down their buildings, but whereas in the recent past they would have been replaced with taller buildings, now they became one- and two-story parking garages or ground-level parking lots. These were widely known as &quot;taxpayers&quot;, as they generated enough revenue for the owner of the lot to pay the taxes on it. Rents fell, sometimes as much as 30%, and non-payment of rent increased. Even with the &quot;taxpayers&quot; taking away commercial space, vacancy rates rose precipitously. Owners went into default, and downtown real estate lost considerable value: 25–30% in the Chicago Loop – although values in other parts of the city, including the outlying business districts, fared even worse.

Department stores were hit hard; most managed to keep their doors open, but few made money. Hotels which needed to have large staffs, and required high occupancy rates to make a profit were also deeply affected; in Manhattan the hotel occupancy rate fell from 1929&#x27;s 70% to around 50% in 1933. Room rates were slashed, revenue dropped, and many hotels closed or defaulted. By 1934, 80% of hotels in Manhattan were owned by their creditors.

===Recovery===
The slow recovery from the effects of the Great Depression began in the mid-1930s, decelerated at the end of the 1930s, and picked up speed with the start of World War II, so that by the early 1940s the country was for the most part out of the Depression. Excess commercial space began to be used, vacancy rates dropped, department store sales rose, hotel occupancy rates went up, and revenues increased.

Despite this recovery, the daytime population of the country&#x27;s downtowns did not rebound. For instance, in Chicago between 1929 and 1949, the population of the city grew 7%, and that of the entire metropolitan area by about 14%, but the daytime population of The Loop only rose 1/3 of 1%. With a few exceptions, such as New York City, this pattern was typical across American cities, and was tied to the slowing down of the rate of growth of the cities themselves. Cities in the US grew much more slowly than during any other period in the history of the country, and some even lost population. Metropolitan regions grew faster than the cities inside them, indicating the start of the decades of urban sprawl, but they too grew at a slower pace than usual. Downtowns also had less daytime population because people now went to the outlying business districts, which were closer to their homes by car, for their shopping and entertainment, to do business, and to work. The increased use of automobiles over mass transit also damaged downtown, since the streetcar lines converged on downtown, while the roads went everywhere. All of these factors contributed to the lesser recovery of downtown relative to the city as a whole and the metropolitan area.

Another sign that downtowns were no longer as central to city life as they once were include the decreased portion of retail trade that took place there as compared to the peripheral business areas, which profited by the growth of the chain stores, to the detriment of the big downtown department stores. Furthermore, the &quot;taxpayers&quot;, which many people had expected to disappear once the economy improved, remained in place, and even increased in number. In the Loop in Chicago, by the early 1940s, 18% of the land was vacant or was used for parking; in Los Angeles at the same time, the figure was 25%. Demand for commercial space was so light that it did not make financial sense to construct expensive new buildings, and banks began to refuse to make loans for that purpose, redlining whole neighborhoods in the central business district.

== Characteristics ==
The typical American downtown has certain unique characteristics. During the postwar economic boom in the 1950s, the residential population of most downtowns crashed. This has been attributed to reasons such as slum clearance, construction of the Interstate Highway System, and white flight from urban cores to rapidly expanding suburbs. Due to well-intended but ineptly executed urban revitalization projects, downtowns eventually came to be dominated by high-rise office buildings in which commuters from the suburbs filled white-collar jobs, while the remaining residential populations sank further into unemployment, poverty, and homelessness. By the 1990s, many office-oriented businesses began to abandon the tired old downtowns for the suburbs, resulting in what are now known as &quot;edge cities&quot;. One textbook, in explaining why edge cities are so popular, stated:

Since then, between 2000 and 2010, downtown areas grew rapidly in population. In U.S. metro areas with at least five million people, the population within two miles of the city hall grew twice as fast as the overall population in the metro area.

== Relative geography ==
The terms &quot;downtown&quot; and &quot;uptown&quot; can refer to cardinal directions, for example, in Manhattan, where &quot;downtown&quot; is also a relative geographical term. Anything south of where the speaker is currently standing, in most places, is said to be &quot;downtown&quot;. Anything north of the speaker is &quot;uptown&quot;. In the common New York City phrase &quot;We&#x27;re going to take the subway downtown&quot;, &quot;downtown&quot; refers to traveling in the geographic direction of south. A person standing on 121st Street and walking ten blocks south could also be said to have walked ten blocks downtown. The term &quot;uptown&quot; is used to refer to the cardinal direction north. Such concepts derive from Manhattan&#x27;s elongated shape, running roughly north–south and nowhere more than wide. As such, transportation on the island travels in the uptown/downtown directions. The other boroughs are wider, and &quot;downtown&quot; there refers to Lower Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, or some more local business district. Mercantile efforts to promote the South Bronx as &quot;Downtown Bronx&quot; have met with little success.

In some North American cities, &quot;downtown&quot; is the formal name of the neighborhood in which the city&#x27;s central business district is located. Most major North American cities are located on major bodies of water, like oceans, lakes, and rivers. As cities expanded, people built further away from the water and their historical cores, often uphill. Thus the central business district of a North American city, or the historical core of the city, is often located &quot;down&quot;, in altitude, relative to the remainder of the city. Many cities use the Manhattan model and continue to use &quot;downtown&quot;, &quot;midtown&quot;, and &quot;uptown&quot; both as informal relative geographical terms and as formal names for distinct districts. However, the city of Philadelphia uses the designation Center City, not downtown, due to the business district&#x27;s central location, as well as Philadelphia&#x27;s age and circumstances; &quot;Center City&quot; corresponds to the City of Philadelphia prior to its amalgamation with Philadelphia County in 1854, leaving it without a unique name, unlike the former boroughs surrounding it; the center of the city is also where Philadelphia City Hall is located within the city&#x27;s original plat. New Orleans uses the term Central Business District (or CBD) for its downtown due to the French Quarter and other historic neighborhoods downriver from the CBD being referred to as &quot;downtown&quot;.

<text>Artemas Ward (November 26, 1727 – October 28, 1800) was an American major general in the American Revolutionary War and a Congressman from Massachusetts. He was considered an effective political leader, President John Adams describing him as &quot;universally esteemed, beloved, and confided in by his army and his country&quot;.

==Early life==
Artemas Ward was born at Shrewsbury in the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1727 to Nahum Ward (1684–1754) and Martha (Howe) Ward. He was the sixth of seven children. His father had broad and successful career interests as a sea captain, merchant, land developer, farmer, lawyer and jurist. As a child he attended the common schools and shared a tutor with his brothers and sisters. He graduated from Harvard in 1748 and taught there briefly.

On July 31, 1750, he married Sarah Trowbridge (December 3, 1724 – December 13, 1788), the daughter of Reverend Caleb Trowbridge and Hannah Trowbridge of Groton. The young couple returned to Shrewsbury where Artemas opened a general store. In the next fifteen years they would have eight children: Ithamar in 1752, Nahum (1754), Sara (1756), Thomas (1758), Artemas Jr. (1762), Henry Dana (1768), Martha (1760), and Maria (1764).

==Career==
===Township assessor===
In 1751, at age 23 or 24, he was named a township assessor for Worcester County, the first of many public offices he was to fill. In 1752 he was elected a justice of the peace and to the first of many terms in the Massachusetts provincial assembly, or &quot;general court.&quot;

===Military career===
====French and Indian War (1754–1758)====
Between 1755 and 1757, Ward was called to active duty at intervals that alternated with his attendance at the General Court. In 1755 the Massachusetts militia was restructured for the war; Ward was made a major in the 3rd Regiment which drew its company mainly from Worcester County. The 3rd primarily served as a garrison force along the frontier in western Massachusetts. In 1757 he was promoted to regimental colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the militias of Middlesex and Worcester counties. In 1758 the regiment marched with Abercrombie&#x27;s force to sortie on Fort Ticonderoga, but Ward was sidelined during the campaign by an &quot;attack of the stone.&quot;

====Between wars====
By 1762, Ward returned to Shrewsbury permanently and was named to the Court of Common Pleas. In the General Court (the provincial assembly) he, with Samuel Adams and John Hancock, was appointed to the taxation committee. On the floor, he was second only to James Otis in speaking out against the acts of parliament in London. His prominence in these debates prompted the Royal Governor Francis Bernard to revoke his military commission in 1767. At the next election in 1768, Bernard voided the election results for Worcester and banned Ward from the assembly, but this didn&#x27;t silence him.

In the growing sentiment favoring rebellion, the 3rd Regiment resigned &quot;en masse&quot; from British service on October 3, 1774. They then marched on Shrewsbury to inform Ward that they had unanimously elected him their leader. Later that month the governor abolished the assembly. The towns of Massachusetts responded by setting up a colony-wide Committee of Safety. One of the first actions of the committee was to name Ward as general and commander-in-chief of the colony&#x27;s militia.

====American Revolutionary War====
Following the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the rebel (colonial) forces followed the British troops back to Boston and deployed to start the Siege of Boston, cutting all land access to the city. At first Ward directed his forces from his sickbed (in Shrewsbury), later moving his headquarters to Cambridge. Soon, both the New Hampshire and Connecticut provisional governments named him commander of their forces participating in the siege. Most of his efforts during this time were devoted to organization and supply problems.

Additional British forces arrived by sea in May, and in June, Ward learned of their plan to attack Bunker Hill. He gave orders to fortify the point, setting the stage for the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. Command during the battle devolved upon General Israel Putnam and Colonel William Prescott.

Meanwhile, the Continental Congress was creating the Continental Army. On June 17, Congress commissioned Ward a major general, and appointed him second in command to General George Washington. (Ward was one of the original four major generals in the Continental Army along with Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler and Israel Putnam.) Over the next nine months he helped convert the assembled militia units into the Continental Army.

After the British evacuation of Boston on March 17, 1776, Washington led the main body of the army to New York City. Ward took command of the Eastern Department and held that post until March 1777, when ill health forced his resignation from the army.

==Post-war and death==
Even during his military service, Ward also served as a state court justice in 1776 and 1777. From 1777 to 1779, as President of the state&#x27;s Executive Council, he effectively served as governor before the ratification of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. He was continuously elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1779 through 1785, leading it as Speaker in 1785.

Ward was appointed a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1781, and from 1791 to 1795 was elected twice to the United States House of Representatives after being an unsuccessful candidate in 1788. He was one of nine representatives to vote against final passage of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Ward died at his home in Shrewsbury on October 28, 1800, and was buried with Sarah in the town&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery. (His great-grandson Artemas Ward wrote &quot;The Grocer&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, published in 1911.)

==Legacy==

===Ward, Massachusetts===
Ward, Massachusetts was incorporated in 1778 in honor of Artemas Ward. In 1837, the town was renamed to Auburn, Massachusetts after complaints from the U.S. postal service that the name Ward was too similar to the nearby town of Ware.

===Artemas Ward House===
Wards&#x27;s lifelong home had been built by his father, Nahum, about the time Artemas was born. The home is now known as the &quot;Artemas Ward House&quot; and is a museum preserved by Harvard University. Located at 786 Main Street in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts it is open to the public for limited hours during the summer months.

===Ward Circle===
Ward Circle is a traffic circle at the intersection of Nebraska and Massachusetts Avenues in Northwest Washington, D.C. The land on three sides of Ward Circle is owned by American University. The circle contains a statue of Ward.

The great-grandson of Ward gave over four million dollars to Harvard University on the condition that they erect a statue in honor of Ward, and maintain his home in Shrewsbury. Harvard&#x27;s initial offer in 1927 of $50,000 toward the statue was enough for a statue, but inadequate to provide the general with a horse.

The statue was unveiled on November 3, 1938 by Maj. Gen. Ward&#x27;s great-great-great-granddaughter, Mrs. Lewis Wesley Feick. Although there are no crosswalks for pedestrian access to the circle, the base of the statue bears this inscription:
===American University===
American University named the Ward Circle Building, home of the American University School of Public Affairs, in honor of Artemas Ward.

<doc id="251028" wikidata="Q385180" url="?curid=251028" title="Battle of the Yalu River (1894)">
<text>The Battle of the Yalu River (; ; ) was the largest naval engagement of the First Sino-Japanese War, and took place on 17 September 1894, the day after the Japanese victory at the land Battle of Pyongyang. It involved ships from the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Chinese Beiyang Fleet.

The battle is also known by a variety of names: Battle of Haiyang Island, Battle of Dadonggou, Battle of the Yellow Sea and Battle of Yalu, after the geographic location of the battle, which was in the Yellow Sea off the mouth of the Yalu River and not in the river itself. There is no agreement among contemporary sources on the exact numbers and composition of each fleet, but both were of a similar size, and the battle is considered to be one of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s greatest victories.

==Background==
===Japan&#x27;s strategy===
Japan&#x27;s initial strategy was to gain command of the sea, which was critical to its operations in Korea. Command of the sea would allow Japan to transport troops to the mainland. The Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces northwest up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending on the outcome of this engagement, Japan would make one of three choices; If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively, the larger part of the Japanese army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between Shanhai Pass and Tianjin in order to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the engagement were to be a draw and neither side gained control of the sea, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action.

===Chinese moves===

With tensions with Japan increasing over the situation on the peninsula, the Chinese government chartered three steamers to carry reinforcements to Korea in late July to bolster their position there. The three troopships were escorted by three naval vessels, the cruiser and the gunboats &quot;Kwang-yi&quot; and . A Japanese force consisting of the cruisers , and intercepted the three Chinese warships off Pungo Island, precipitating the action. Within one hour, the engagement ended in a Japanese victory, with &quot;Jiyuan&quot; forced to flee, &quot;Kwang-yi&quot; stranded on a shoal and &quot;Tsao-kiang&quot; captured. Although the first two of the three troopships arrived safely in Korea, on 25 July 1894, &quot;Naniwa&quot; intercepted the third, &quot;Kowshing&quot;, which was carrying 1,200 Chinese troops. When the Chinese troops on board refused to surrender or to be interned &quot;Naniwa&quot; sank the vessel. Over 800 Chinese soldiers died in the action.

Admiral Ding Ruchang had learned about the engagement at Pungdo on the morning of 26 July, when, at 6:00 am, the damaged cruiser &quot;Jiyuan&quot; arrived at Weihaiwei. Although the Chinese admiral had not been aware of the sinking of &quot;Kowshing&quot;, he considered the destruction of &quot;Kwang-yi&quot; and shelling of &quot;Jiyuan&quot; as an act of war. On the same day, without even notifying Li Hongzhang, he left Weihaiwei with eleven warships and seven torpedo boats and headed for the Korean coast, while the damaged &quot;Jiyuan&quot; sailed to Lüshunkou for repairs. After arriving in Korean waters on the morning of the following day, the Chinese ships cruised the area looking to engage the enemy. However, the abrupt change in the weather made the patrolling of the Korean waters more arduous, especially for the small torpedo boats and consequently the Chinese fleet returned to Weihaiwei on 28 July. The Chinese warships immediately resupplied themselves with coal while the weather improved, and the main force of the Beiyang Fleet was put to sea again on the following day but without the torpedo boats, heading for the Korean coast. This second cruise lasted longer, until 3 August, but the fleet did not encounter the Japanese.

At the beginning of September, Li Hongzhang decided to reinforce the Chinese forces at Pyongyang, by employing the Beiyang Fleet to escort transports to the mouth of the Taedong River. About 4,500 additional troops were to be redeployed, these had been stationed in the Zhili. On 12 September, half of the troops embarked at Taku on five specially chartered transports and headed to Dalian where two days later, on 14 September, they were joined by another 2,000 soldiers. Initially, Admiral Ding wanted to send the transports under a light escort with only a few ships, while the main force of the Beiyang Fleet would locate and operate directly against Combined Fleet, in order to prevent the Japanese from intercepting the convoy. However, the appearance near Weihaiwei of the Japanese cruisers &quot;Yoshino&quot; and &quot;Naniwa&quot;, which were on reconnaissance sortie, thwarted these plans. The Chinese mistook them for the main Japanese fleet. Consequently on 12 September, the entire Beiyang Fleet departed Dalian, heading for Weihaiwei and arriving near the Shandong Peninsula the following day. The Chinese warships spent the entire day cruising the area, waiting for the Japanese. However, since there was no sighting of the Japanese, Admiral Ding decided to return to Dalian, arriving there in the morning of 15 September.

The Japanese victory at Pyongyang had succeeded in pushing Chinese troops north to the Yalu River, in the process removing all effective Chinese military presence on the Korean peninsula. Shortly before the convoy&#x27;s departure, Admiral Ding received a message concerning the battle at Pyongyang. Although it was rather inaccurate, it informed him about the defeat and subsequently made the redeployment of the troops to near the mouth of the Taedong River unnecessary. Admiral Ding, who then correctly assumed that the next Chinese line of defence would be established on the Yalu River, decided to redeploy the embarked soldiers there. On 16 September, at about 1:00 am, the convoy of five transport ships departed from the Dalian Bay under escort from the main force of the Beiyang Fleet which included the ironclad battleships and , the small coastal defence battleship , the cruisers , , &quot;Jiyuan&quot;, and , the small cruisers , and , torpedo gunboat &quot;Guangbing&quot;, the gunboats &quot;Zhennan&quot; and &quot;Zhenzhong&quot; as well as the torpedo boats and &quot;Zuo 1&quot;. They reached the mouth of the Yalu River at about 6:00 pm. The transports, escorted by &quot;Pingyuan&quot;, &quot;Guangbing&quot;, &quot;Zhennan&quot;, &quot;Zhenzhong&quot;, together with both torpedo boats, immediately steamed up the river and dropped their anchors approximately from the mouth of the Yalu. The troops were disembarked and the landing operation lasted until the morning of 17 September. Meanwhile, the remaining warships of the Beiyang Fleet anchored in shallow waters about from the shore, south-west of the mouth of the river, where they remained for the rest of the day and the entire night. On 17 September, at 9:20 am, the fleet left its position and conducted a one-and-a-half-hour training exercise before returning to their previous anchorage. Soon thereafter, at 11:28 am, observers on board the Chinese warships spotted smoke from unknown vessels heading from the south-west.

===Fleet composition===
The Japanese Combined Fleet consisted of two formations. A flying squadron, composed of the four fast cruisers &quot;Yoshino&quot;, , &quot;Akitsushima&quot;, and &quot;Naniwa&quot;, was under the command of Tsuboi Kōzō. The main fleet consisted of the cruisers (flagship), , , , the ironclads , and , under the command of Admiral Itō Sukeyuki. There were also two dispatch vessels, the converted liner under the command of Swedish-born merchant navy captain John Wilson, and the gunboat . The Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Kabayama Sukenori was on a tour of inspection and aboard &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot;.

Admiral Ding attempted to form his fleet into a southward-facing line abreast with the strongest ships (&quot;Dingyuan&quot;, &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;) in the center. The newer &quot;Jiyuan&quot;, &quot;Guangjia&quot;, , &quot;Jingyuan&quot;, &quot;Laiyuan&quot;, &quot;Jingyuen&quot;, and the obsolete &quot;Chaoyong&quot; and &quot;Yangwei&quot;, were lined from left to right. The four-ship group led by &quot;Pingyuan&quot;, having escorted a convoy upriver, had to catch up, and only joined the action around 2:30 pm, in time to chase off &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot;.

The Beiyang Fleet had completed escorting a convoy to the mouth of the Yalu River, and was returning to its base at Lüshunkou when it was engaged by the Japanese Navy. On paper, the Beiyang Fleet had the superior ships, including two ironclad battleships, &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;, for which the Japanese had no counterparts. The Beiyang Fleet could also call on the assistance of numerous military advisers, including Prussian Army major Constantin von Hanneken, recently from Korea, who was appointed as the naval adviser to Ding. W. F. Tyler, a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy Reserve and an Imperial Maritime Customs officer, was appointed as von Hanneken&#x27;s assistant. Philo McGiffin, a graduate of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis and now a soldier of fortune and an instructor at the Weihaiwei Naval Academy, was appointed to &quot;Jingyuan&quot; as an adviser or co-commander.

However, examination reveals the truth about China&#x27;s seemingly advantageous position, as most of their warships were over-age and obsolescent; the ships were also not maintained properly and indiscipline was common among their crews. The greater armour of major Chinese warships and the greater weight of broadside they could fire were more than offset by the number of quick-firing guns on most first-line Japanese warships, which gave the Japanese the edge in any sustained exchange of salvos. The worst feature of both Chinese battleships was actually their main armament; each was armed with short-barreled guns in twin barbettes mounted in echelon which could fire only in restricted arcs. The short barrels of the Chinese main armament meant that the shells had low muzzle velocities and poor penetration, and their accuracy was also poor at long ranges.

Tactically, Chinese naval vessels entered the war with only the crudest sets of instructions – ships that were assigned to designated pairs were to keep together and all ships were to fight end-on, as far forward from the beam as possible, a tactic dictated by the obsolescent arrangement of guns aboard Chinese warships. The only vague semblance of a fleet tactic was that all ships were to follow the visible movements of the flagship, an arrangement made necessary because the signal book used by the Chinese was written in English, a language with which few officers in the Beiyang Fleet had any familiarity.

Though well drilled, the Chinese had not engaged in sufficient gunnery practice beforehand. This lack of training was the direct result of a serious lack of ammunition. Corruption seems to have played a major role; many Chinese shells appear to have been filled with cement or porcelain, or were the wrong caliber and could not be fired. Philo McGiffin noted that many of the gunpowder charges were &quot;thirteen years old and condemned&quot;. What little ammunition there was, was to be preserved for real battle. Live ammunition training was rarely carried out. Li wanted to delay the battle against the Japanese fleet, thus allowing the Chinese more time to equip their ships with additional ammunition. However, the Imperial Court called him a coward and his recommendation was turned down. The Chinese fleet was bigger and armed with bigger guns. The Japanese fleet was much faster. As a result, the Japanese would have an advantage in open water.

==Battle==

===Initial contact and engagement===
Late in the morning the two fleets approached each other, in contrasting formations. The Chinese had intended to form a line abreast, but due to confusion in signals and the differing speeds of the ships, they were in a wedge formation, with the two battleships at the fore and the other vessels trailing behind on both flanks. The Japanese were in column formation with the Flying Squadron in front, followed by the main squadron.

When the enemy was well in sight Admiral Sukeyuki Ito ordered the Flying Squadron to attack the Beiyang Fleet&#x27;s right flank. The Chinese opened fire at a range of , which was far too great to cause any damage. The Japanese, meanwhile, held their fire for another twenty minutes as they headed diagonally across the Beiyang Fleet at twice the speed. On the signal of Admiral Ito, the Japanese squadrons divided. The flying squadron under Tsuboi increased speed from and headed for the very centre of the Chinese formation; the tactic held the puzzled enemy in position. Turning slightly to port, the flying squadron then moved around the right flank of the Chinese formation to strike at the weakest units there. Holding fire until they were in effective range, the cruisers battered &quot;Chaoyong&quot; and &quot;Yangwei&quot;. The flying squadron then moved northward to engage Chinese reinforcements coming from the Yalu River.

The main squadron of the Japanese fleet initially followed the same course as the flying squadron towards the Chinese left but completed the turn all the way round to circle behind the Chinese fleet. As the flying squadron again turned south, the Beiyang Fleet was caught between the two Japanese squadrons. &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot; resisted the heaviest bombardment as a result of their armour; however, the quick firing Japanese guns decimated crews on their decks.

The Flying Squadron meanwhile re-engaged, sinking the cruiser &quot;Zhiyuan&quot; that had attempted to ram one of the Japanese cruisers, then set off in pursuit of one of several ships on the Chinese left which were deserting their fleet and had fled toward the shallow waters to the north. The squadron successfully hunted down and destroyed the cruiser &quot;Jingyuan&quot;, but in doing so inadvertently allowed the other Chinese vessels to escape. By this time the main Japanese squadron under Admiral Itō was circling what remained of the Chinese force, the major Japanese ships fired their heavy and quick-firing guns that swept the decks of the Chinese ships and smashed their superstructures. Many of the Japanese ships, however, also received major damage. &quot;Yoshino&quot; was hit and &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot; were put out of action. also sustained serious damage as a result of her inferior speed, her captain decided not to try to follow the Flying Squadron on its sweep around the Chinese fleet, but instead to pass directly through the Chinese line. This maneuver made &quot;Hiei&quot; an easy target and it sustained a number of serious hits before the ship moved out of range. The damage to &quot;Matsushima&quot;, however, was the most severe; where the lack of armour was made apparent when she was struck by two 12-inch shells that tore open the deck and ignited ready ammunition causing nearly one hundred casualties and forcing Admiral Itō to transfer his flag to &quot;Hashidate&quot;.

By sunset the Beiyang Fleet&#x27;s main formation was near the point of total collapse with both wings gone (the two ships of the Port wing had fled and four units of the Starboard wing destroyed); the four units of the centre were variously damaged and the two largest ships &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot; were nearly out of ammunition.

Several different explanations have been put forward as to why the Beiyang Fleet did not change their formation to react to the Japanese tactics more effectively. Per Royal Navy Lieutenant William Ferdinand Tyler, stationed on &quot;Dingyuan&quot;, Admiral Ding ordered his ships to change course in such a way that would have exposed his ship, the flagship, but put the rest of the squadron in a good position to fire on the Japanese fleet. However, &quot;Dingyuan&quot;″s captain deliberately did not acknowledge this order or pass it on to the rest of the fleet. Instead, he ordered &quot;Dingyuan&quot; to fire its main guns before the Japanese were in range. There is a long-repeated legend that firing the main battery directly forward resulted in the destruction of the flying bridge, but it was a mistranslation of Philo T. McGiffin&#x27;s memoir, which says that he and Ding were &quot;catapulted&quot; by the shockwave. Now historians agree it was Japanese gunfire that destroyed the flying bridge, leaving Admiral Ding with his legs crushed under the wreckage and thus out of combat for the remainder of the battle. Most of his staff officers on the bridge were likewise injured or killed. The situation was worsened when the Japanese destroyed &quot;Dingyuan&quot;″s foremast, making it impossible for the flagship to signal the rest of the fleet. The Chinese fleet, with some foresight, had anticipated something like this happening and formed into three pairs of mutually supporting vessels to carry the fight on.

According to an account from James Allan, an officer aboard the U.S.-flagged supply ship &quot;Columbia&quot;, who witnessed the battle, rumors abounded that Admiral Ding deferred command to Major Constantin von Hannecken. He opined that it was not surprising that the Chinese had suffered such losses if an army officer was directing a naval fleet.

The Chinese fleet opened fire on the Japanese fleet as they passed from port to starboard, across the bows of the Chinese vessels. They failed to score any significant hits on the Japanese with their and guns. At about (the Chinese had been steadily closing the range), the Japanese concentrated their fire on the right flank of the Chinese line, with devastating barrages poured into &quot;Chaoyong&quot; and &quot;Yangwei&quot;. Both those vessels burst into flames, because of their heavily varnished and polished wooden surfaces. Burning fiercely, both tried to save themselves by beaching.

As the Japanese ships opened fire, &quot;Jiyuan&quot; turned and fled, followed by &quot;Guangjia&quot;. &quot;Jiyuan&quot; was hit only once, while &quot;Guangjia&quot; became lost, ran aground, and was scuttled a few days later by its own crew. Some sources also say &quot;Jiyuan&quot; collided with &quot;Yangwei&quot;, causing her sinking.

The Japanese had intended to swing the flying division around the right flank of the Chinese line in an encirclement, but the timely arrival of the &quot;Kuang Ping&quot; and &quot;Pingyuan&quot;, along with the torpedo boats &quot;Fu Lung&quot; (built at Schichau) and &quot;Choi Ti&quot; (a Yarrow-built vessel), diverted this maneuver.

The Japanese fast cruisers veered to port and were then dispatched by Admiral Itoh to go to the assistance of &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;, which had been unable to keep up with the main line, and had then been engaged by the left-hand vessels of the Chinese line when &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot; tried to finish off the beached &quot;Yangwei&quot;.

At 3:20 pm, the severely crippled and burning &quot;Zhiyuan&quot; tried to ram &quot;Naniwa&quot; (Chinese source says &quot;Yoshino&quot;) but failed. She sank along with her captain, Deng Shichang.

The Japanese fleet&#x27;s more reliable, better-maintained ordnance and overwhelming superiority in rapid-firing guns gave it a tactical advantage over the Beiyang Fleet, which fought with limited stocks, consisting of older foreign ammunition and shoddy domestic products. Japanese shells set four Chinese vessels ablaze, destroying three. However, firefighting was well organized on the Chinese vessels. For example, &quot;Laiyuan&quot; burned severely, yet kept firing. &quot;Dingyuan&quot; stayed afloat and had casualties of 14 dead and 25 wounded. A total of about 850 Chinese sailors were killed in the battle, with 500 wounded.

The Chinese severely damaged four Japanese warships and lightly damaged two others. Japanese losses were roughly 180 killed and 200 wounded. The Japanese flagship &quot;Matsushima&quot; suffered the worst single-ship loss, with more than 100 dead or wounded after being hit by a heavy Chinese round. &quot;Hiei&quot; was severely damaged and retired from the conflict; &quot;Akagi&quot; suffered from heavy fire, with great loss of life. &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot;, the converted liner, urged on by Admiral Kabayama Sukenori despite its lack of offensive armament, had been hit by four 12-inch (305 mm) shells and was left sailing virtually out of control as a result.

==Analysis==
As it was the first fleet encounter since Lissa in 1866, the battle was studied for its tactical lessons not only by the Japanese Navy General Staff, but by naval staffs around the globe. The lessons to a degree were unclear, since the two fleet encounters seemed to be contradictory and cancelled each other out. At Lissa, the Austrians had used the ram in a bows-on frontal attack, in a line abreast formation, whereas the Yalu had been won by broadside naval gunfire delivered from a line ahead formation. What also remained unresolved by the encounter was the debate between the proponents of the big gun and advocates of armor. Although the Canet guns of the &quot;Sankeikan&quot;-class cruisers had malfunctioned and thus the heaviest Japanese shells had not hit the two Chinese battleships, no other shells had penetrated their armor belts deeper than 4 inches.

However, there were some conclusions that could be drawn from the course and outcome of the battle. The first was that the line ahead was the best formation which preserved the greatest flexibility and simplicity of movement, minimized tactical confusion and also maximized broadside fire. The case against the line abreast formation was not yet absolutely certain, but the wedge formation adopted purposely or accidentally by the Chinese could only have been effective in the hands of a commander whose ship captains had mastered fleet movements, which Ding&#x27;s subordinates had not. Secondly, the one common denominator between Lissa and the Yalu appeared to be that the victor had fought in separated squadrons. This arrangement provided tactical flexibility and consequently widened the options for maneuver during the chaos of battle.

Due to the Chinese Navy&#x27;s weak preparations for the battle, faulty ammunition, and a lack of communication and discipline, which was the cause of at least one account of fragging, the Japanese forces were able to operate under very desirable conditions. Their victory in the battle established naval supremacy, demonstrated the weakness of the Chinese military, and by extension, the strength of their own. The New York Times would liken the battle to Waterloo.

==Aftermath==
The remnants of the Beiyang Fleet retired into Lüshunkou for repairs, but were withdrawn to Weihaiwei to avoid a second encounter with the Japanese fleet during the Battle of Lüshunkou. The Japanese did not pursue the retreating ships, as &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot; were only slightly damaged, and the Japanese had no way of knowing that the battleships suffered from a lack of ammunition. What remained of the Beiyang Fleet was finally destroyed during a combined Japanese land and naval attack at Weihaiwei.

The defeat of the Beiyang Fleet at the Battle of Yalu River was a major propaganda victory for Japan, with many major European newspapers, including the &quot;London Times&quot;, &quot;Le Temps&quot; and &quot;Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti&quot;, providing front-page coverage and crediting the Japanese victory to its rapid assimilation of western methods and technology. Many credited the prompt action of foreign advisers in the Beiyang Fleet (most notably McGiffin) from keeping the fleet from total annihilation, and for keeping even the most heavily damaged Chinese ships fighting until the very end of the engagement. Some contemporary military analysts, notably U.S. Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, called the battle &#x27;nearly a draw&#x27; – although the Chinese had lost several warships, the Japanese had suffered considerable damage, and if the Chinese ammunition had been of higher quality, the outcome might have been different. In addition to Herbert, several other American officials published analyses of the battle, including Alfred Thayer Mahan and William F. Halsey Sr.

However, other factors were responsible for the Chinese defeat such as that most of the Chinese ships were over-age, obsolescent and ill-maintained. Additionally undisciplined crews and deficient naval tactics were also at fault. Mark Peattie and Davids Evans state the principal factors in the Japanese victory was their superiority in firepower, particularly an overwhelming advantage in quick-firing guns which proved to be devastating in the hands of well-trained and disciplined gun crews. At the time fire control systems were in their infancy with significant advances still some years away, neither side achieved more than a fraction of hits out of the total number of rounds fired. A contemporary European diplomat also concurs, observing that Japan&#x27;s naval &quot;victories were due to the skill and daring of her sailors, and not to the ships which they manned&quot;.

The Chinese government, after initially denying that its fleet had been defeated, put the blame for the Chinese defeat on Viceroy Li Hongzhang and Admiral Ding Ruchang, both of whom were demoted and stripped of honors. Their subordinates and relatives suffered similar fates. However, both men remained in their posts, and would oversee the final destruction of the Beiyang Fleet at Weihaiwei. However, this attempt to save face were insufficient, as the foreign press would come to find that many of China&#x27;s claims were false, discrediting them in the eyes of the international community. The Battle of the Yalu and the naval defeats of 1894–1895 in general have been the topic of extensive discussion among Chinese historians and naval officers since events held to mark the 120th anniversary in 2014.

While it was not the first battle involving pre-dreadnought technology on a wide scale (the Battle of Fuzhou in the 1884 Sino-French War predated it), there were significant lessons for naval observers to consider.

Liu Kunyi was replaced by Zhang Zhidong as head of the Nanyang fleet as the Grand Council due to his refusal to send reinforcements north from the fleet. Zhang began organising 5 cruisers from the Nanyang fleet to reinforce the Beiyang fleet which would negate the losses of the Beiyang fleet.

<doc id="251032" wikidata="Q163067" url="?curid=251032" title="Nero Decree">
<text>The Nero Decree () was issued by Adolf Hitler on 19 March 1945, ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent its use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany. It was officially titled Decree Concerning Demolitions in the Reich Territory () and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor Nero, who, according to an apocryphal story, engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. The decree was deliberately disobeyed by Albert Speer shortly before the fall of the Nazi regime.

==Background==
By the beginning of 1945, the situation for Germany was desperate. Most of the conquered territories had been liberated or recaptured, the Ardennes Offensive had failed, and Allied armies were advancing on Germany proper from both the East and the West. However, Hitler was not willing to accept the terms of unconditional surrender, and considered this as repeating the same shame as Versailles. Moreover, according to some around him, Hitler came to view the German people as having failed him, unworthy of their great mission in history and thus deserving to die alongside his regime.

This was not the first time Hitler had tried to destroy infrastructure before it could be taken. Shortly before the Liberation of Paris, Hitler ordered explosives to be placed around important landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, and key transportation hubs. If the Allies came near the city, the military governor, General Dietrich von Choltitz was to detonate these bombs, leaving Paris &quot;lying in complete debris&quot;. Von Choltitz, however, did not carry out the order and surrendered to the Allies, later alleging that this was the moment he realised that &quot;Hitler was insane&quot;. Similarly, Hitler had issued orders to enact a scorched earth policy upon the Netherlands in late 1944, when it became obvious that the Allies were about to retake the country, but Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; in charge of the Netherlands during its occupation, was able to greatly limit the scope to which the order was executed.

==Decree==
The order&#x27;s most pertinent section reads as follows:
It is a mistake to think that transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, which have not been destroyed, or have only been temporarily put out of action, can be used again for our own ends when the lost territory has been recovered. The enemy will leave us nothing but scorched earth when he withdraws, without paying the slightest regard to the population. I therefore order:

1) All military transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, as well as anything else of value within Reich territory, which could in any way be used by the enemy immediately or within the foreseeable future for the prosecution of the war, will be destroyed.
==Actions==

The decree was in vain. The responsibility for carrying it out fell to Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s Minister of Armaments and War Production. According to him, Speer was appalled by the order and lost faith in the &quot;Führer&quot;. Just as von Choltitz had several months earlier, Speer deliberately failed to carry out the order. Upon receiving it, he requested to be given exclusive power to implement the plan, instead using his power to convince the generals and &quot;Gauleiters&quot; to ignore the order. Hitler apparently remained unaware of this until the very end of the war. Speer would later claim that during his last ever meeting with Hitler on 22 April in the Berlin Führerbunker, he admitted to having deliberately disobeyed his instructions. Hitler was allegedly angry with Speer, but allowed him to leave nonetheless. However, Speer&#x27;s recollection has been disputed by some historians, with Richard J. Evans describing it as &quot;pure invention.&quot; Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945, forty-two days after issuing the order. Shortly afterwards, on 7 May 1945, General Alfred Jodl signed the German military surrender, and on 23 May Speer was arrested on the orders of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, together with the rest of the provisional German government led by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Hitler&#x27;s successor as head of state.

<text>A cauldron (or caldron) is a large pot (kettle) for cooking or boiling over an open fire, with a lid and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger and/or integral handles or feet. There is a rich history of cauldron lore in religion, mythology, and folklore.

== Etymology ==
The word cauldron is first recorded in Middle English as &quot;caudroun&quot; (13th century). It was borrowed from Norman &quot;caudron&quot; (Picard &quot;caudron&quot;, ). It represents the phonetical evolution of Vulgar Latin &quot;*caldario&quot; for Classical Latin &quot;caldārium&quot; &quot;hot bath&quot;, that derives from &quot;cal(i)dus&quot; &quot;hot&quot;.

The Norman-French word replaces the Old English &quot;ċetel&quot; (German &quot;(Koch)Kessel&quot; &quot;cauldron&quot;, Dutch &quot;(kook)ketel&quot; &quot;cauldron&quot;), Middle English &quot;chetel&quot;. The word &quot;kettle&quot; is a borrowing of the Old Norse variant &quot;ketill&quot; &quot;cauldron&quot;.
== History ==
From Latin origin, the term cauldron is derived from caldrius, meaning “hot.” This word provided the root meaning for caldarium, a cooking-pot and the Anglo- Norman French cauderon, from which came the Middle English word caldron in the fourteenth century.

== Symbolism and mythology ==

Cauldrons have largely fallen out of use in the developed world as cooking vessels. While still used for practical purposes, a more common association in Western culture is the cauldron&#x27;s use in witchcraft—a &quot;cliché&quot; popularized by various works of fiction, such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In fiction, witches often prepare their potions in a cauldron. Also, in Irish folklore, a cauldron is purported to be where leprechauns keep their gold and treasure.

In some forms of Wicca, appropriating aspects of Celtic mythology, the cauldron is associated with the goddess Cerridwen. Welsh legend also tells of cauldrons that were useful to warring armies. In the second branch of the Mabinogi in the tale of &quot;Branwen, Daughter of Llŷr&quot;, the Pair Dadeni (Cauldron of Rebirth) is a magical cauldron in which dead warriors could be placed and then be returned to life, save that they lacked the power of speech. It was suspected that they lacked souls. These warriors could go back into battle until they were killed again. In Wicca and some other forms of neopagan or pagan belief systems, the cauldron is still used in magical practices. Most often a cauldron is made of cast iron and is used to burn loose incense on a charcoal disc, to make black salt (used in banishing rituals), for mixing herbs, or to burn petitions (paper with words of power or wishes written on them). Cauldrons symbolize not only the Goddess but also represent the womb (because it holds something) and on an altar, it represents earth because it is a working tool. Cauldrons are often sold in New Age or &quot;metaphysical&quot; stores and may have various symbols of power inscribed on them.

The Holy Grail of Arthurian legend is sometimes referred to as a &quot;cauldron&quot;, although traditionally the grail is thought of as a hand-held cup rather than the large pot that the word &quot;cauldron&quot; usually is used to mean. This may have resulted from the combination of the grail legend with earlier Celtic myths of magical cauldrons.

The common translation for ding is often referred to as a cauldron. In Chinese history and culture, possession of one or more ancient dings is often associated with power and dominion over the land. Therefore, the ding is often used as an implicit symbolism for power. The term &quot;inquiring of the ding&quot; (Chinese: 问鼎; pinyin: wèn dǐng) is often used to symbolize the use of divination or for the quest for power. One example of the ding cauldron and gaining power over the traditional provinces of China is the Nine Tripod Cauldrons (whether regarded as myth or history).

Archeologically intact actual cauldrons with apparent cultural symbolism include:
* the Gundestrup cauldron, made in the 2nd or 1st century BC, found at Gundestrup, Denmark
* a Bronze Age cauldron found at Hassle, Sweden
* Ceremonial cauldrons from the ancient Armenian state of Urartu
* the cauldron where the Olympic Flame burns for the duration of the Olympic Games

Cauldrons known only through myth and literature include:
* Dagda&#x27;s Cauldron
* The Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant
* Pair Dadeni
* Cauldron of Hymir

<text>A chalice (from Latin &#x27;cup&#x27;, taken from the Ancient Greek () &#x27;cup&#x27;) is a drinking cup raised on a stem with a foot or base. Although it is a technical archaeological term, in modern parlance the word is now used almost exclusively for the cups used in Christian liturgy as part of a service of the Eucharist, such as a Catholic mass. These are normally made of metal, but neither the shape nor the material is a requirement. Most have no handles, and in recent centuries the cup at the top has usually been a simple flared shape.

Historically, the same shape was used for elite secular vessels, and many individual examples have served both secular and liturgical uses over their history, for example the Lacock Cup and Royal Gold Cup, both late medieval cups. Cups owned by churches were much more likely to survive, as secular drinkware in precious metal was usually melted down when it fell out of fashion.

The same general cup shape is also called a goblet (from Old French , diminutive of &#x27;cup&#x27;), normally in secular contexts. This remains current as a term for wineglasses and other stemware, most of which have a goblet shape, with Paris goblet as a trade term for basic rounded wineglasses. The modern French term &quot;gobelet&quot; has developed differently, and is used for different shapes such as the Gobelet André Falquet and Roman Lyon Cup, both stemless.

==Religious use==
===Christian===
The ancient Roman was a cup or drinking vessel, probably rather vaguely defined as to its exact shape. But most consisted of a bowl on a stem over a foot or base; handles were probably optional. The Greek kylix, at least as defined by modern authorities, was a far wider and more shallow bowl on some sort of stem, with two horizontal handles. It is the most common wine cup seen in paintings of symposium drinking parties. Gradually the term became more or less restricted to cups for liturgical use.

In Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Lutheranism and some other Christian denominations, a chalice is a standing cup used to hold sacramental wine during the Eucharist (also called the Lord&#x27;s Supper or Holy Communion). Chalices are often made of precious metal, and they are sometimes richly enamelled and jewelled. Generally they have no handles.

Chalices have been used since the early Church. Because of Jesus&#x27; command to his disciples to &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; (), and Paul&#x27;s account of the Eucharistic rite in , the celebration of the Eucharist became central to Christian liturgy. Naturally, the vessels used in this important act of worship were highly decorated and treated with great respect. A number of early examples of chalices have a large bowl and two vertical handles, reflecting classical cup shapes such as the kantharos and skyphos. Over time, the size of the bowl diminished and the base became larger for better stability. Eventually, official church regulations dictated the construction, blessing, and treatment of chalices. Some religious traditions still require that the chalice, at least on the inside of the cup, be gold-plated.

In Western Christianity, chalices will often have a knop, pommel or node where the stem meets the cup to make the elevation easier. In Roman Catholicism, chalices of recent centuries tend to have quite narrow cups. Roman Catholic priests will often receive chalices from members of their families when first ordained.
In Eastern Christianity (Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches), chalices will often have icons enameled or engraved on them, as well as a cross. In Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism, all communicants receive both the Body of Christ and the Blood of Christ. To accomplish this, a portion of the Lamb (host) is placed in the chalice, and then the faithful receive Communion on a spoon. For this reason, eastern chalices tend to have larger, rounded cups. In the Russian Orthodox Church, the faithful will often kiss the &quot;foot&quot; (base) of the chalice after receiving Holy Communion. In other traditions, they will kiss the cup. Although Orthodox monks are not permitted to hold personal possessions, the canons permit a hieromonk (i.e., a monk who has been ordained to the priesthood) to keep a chalice and other vessels necessary to celebrate the Divine Liturgy.

In the early and medieval church, when a deacon was ordained, he would be handed a chalice during the service as a sign of his ministry. In the West the deacon carries the chalice to the altar at the offertory; in the East, the priest carries the chalice and the deacon carries the paten (). Only wine, water and a portion of the Host are permitted to be placed in the chalice, and it may not be used for any profane purpose.

The chalice is considered to be one of the most sacred vessels in Christian liturgical worship, and it is often blessed before use. In the Roman Catholic Church and some Anglo-Catholic churches, it was the custom for a chalice to be consecrated by being anointed with chrism, and this consecration could only be performed by a bishop or abbot (only for use within his own monastery). Among the Eastern Churches, there are varying practices regarding blessing. In some traditions, the very act of celebrating the Sacred Mysteries (Eucharist) is the only blessing necessary; in others, there is a special rite of blessing. In some Eastern traditions, this blessing may be done only by a bishop, in some it may be done by a priest. In any case, in both the East and the West, once a chalice has been blessed, it may only be touched by an ordained member of the higher clergy (bishop, priest or deacon). In the Russian Orthodox Church, a subdeacon is permitted to touch the holy vessels, but only if they are wrapped in cloth.

====The Holy Chalice====

In Christian tradition, the Holy Chalice is the vessel which Jesus used at the Last Supper to serve the wine. New Testament texts make no mention of the cup except within the context of the Last Supper and give no significance whatsoever to the object itself. Herbert Thurston in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; 1908 concluded that &quot;No reliable tradition has been preserved to us regarding the vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper. In the sixth and seventh centuries pilgrims to Jerusalem were led to believe that the actual chalice was still venerated in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, having within it the sponge which was presented to Our Saviour on Calvary.&quot; Several surviving standing cups of precious materials are identified in local traditions as the Chalice.

====Holy Grail====

An entirely different and pervasive tradition concerns the cup of the Last Supper. In this highly muddled though better-known version, the vessel is known as the Holy Grail. In this legend, Jesus used the cup at the Last Supper to institute the Mass.
Other stories claim that Joseph of Arimathea used the cup to collect and store the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion.

===Unitarian Universalism===
At the opening of Unitarian Universalist worship services, many congregations light a flame inside a chalice. A flaming chalice is the most widely used symbol of Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism (UU), and the official logo of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and other Unitarian and UU churches and societies. The design was originated by the artist Hans Deutsch, who took his inspiration from the chalices of oil burned on ancient Greek and Roman altars. It became an underground symbol in occupied Europe during World War II for assistance to help Unitarians, Jews, and other people escape Nazi persecution. The chalice is often shown surrounded by two linked rings. The two linked rings were used as an early symbol for the Unitarian Universalist Association, signifying the joining of Unitarianism and Universalism.

There is no standardized interpretation of the flaming chalice symbol. In one interpretation, the chalice is a symbol of religious freedom from the impositions of doctrine by a hierarchy and openness to participation by all; the flame is interpreted as a memorial to those throughout history who sacrificed their lives for the cause of religious liberty. In another interpretation, the flaming chalice resembles a cross, symbolic of the Christian roots of Unitarian Universalism.

=== Wicca ===

In Wicca, a chalice, as a feminine principle, is often used in combination with the Athame (ceremonial black-handled knife), as male principle. Combining the two evokes the act of procreation, as a symbol of universal creativity. This is a symbol of the Great Rite in Wiccan rituals. A chalice is also used in the Small Rite.

===Neo-Paganism===
Some other forms of Neo-Paganism make use of chalices in their rituals as well. A chalice may be placed on an altar or on the ground. The chalice may contain wine, whiskey, water, or other liquids. It is used to represent the genitalia of the goddess or female deity.

===Rastafarian===

Rastafaris sometimes smoke ganja in a &quot;chalice&quot; (waterpipe or bong) during an activity called reasoning intended to put participants in touch with peaceful feelings, unity, and &quot;consciousness.&quot;

== Poisoned chalice ==
The term &quot;poisoned chalice&quot; is applied to a thing or situation which appears to be good when it is received or experienced by someone, but then becomes or is found to be bad. The idea was referred to by Benedict of Nursia in one of his exorcisms, found on the Saint Benedict Medal: (&#x27;Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities! What you offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself!&#x27;).
William Shakespeare uses the expression in Act I Scene VII of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. It occurs in the opening soliloquy of the scene when Macbeth is considering the ramifications of the murder he is plotting.

&lt;poem&gt;But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison&#x27;d chalice
To our own lips. [1.7.7–12] &lt;/poem&gt;

== Heraldry ==

The use of chalices as heraldic devices is not unusual, especially in ecclesiastical heraldry. A number of cities and regions also make use of the chalice. For instance, the coat of arms of the municipality of Fanas in the district of Prättigau/Davos in the Swiss canton of Graubünden bears a gold chalice on a solid blue background. The coat of arms of Staufen im Breisgau contains the three golden chalices (i.e. in ancient German) of the , advocates of the monastery of St. Trudpert. A golden chalice (or in some instances three or five) on blue background has been used as coat of arms for the Kingdom of Galicia since at least the late Middle Ages, and is still central in its renewed heraldry.

==Other usage==
===Québec===

In French-Canadian culture, particularly in and around Quebec, the use of the names of holy objects such as &quot;câlice&quot; (a variation of calice, which is the French word for chalice) can be an alternate form of cursing. Somewhat equivalent to the American word &quot;goddam&quot; or the phrase &quot;God damn it&quot;, the use of &quot;câlice&quot; or &quot;tabarnak&quot; (a variation of tabernacle) as an interjection is not uncommon in Quebec. For example: &quot;Câlice! I forgot to lock the front door&quot; or muttering &quot;tabarnak&quot; under one&#x27;s breath after they get a flat tire. This is presumably a derivation of &quot;taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain&quot;.

===Czech Republic===
With reference to the Hussite movement in the Kingdom of Bohemia, besides religious use, the chalice also became one of the unofficial national symbols of the Czechs. It is frequently used in Czech national symbolism and it is part of many historical banners.

<doc id="251047" wikidata="Q721073" url="?curid=251047" title="Delusional disorder">
<text>Delusional disorder, traditionally synonymous with [[paranoia]], is a mental illness in which a person has delusions, but with no accompanying prominent hallucinations, thought disorder, mood disorder, or significant flattening of affect. Delusions are a specific symptom of psychosis. Delusions can be bizarre or non-bizarre in content; non-bizarre delusions are fixed false beliefs that involve situations that could occur in real life, such as being harmed or poisoned. Apart from their delusion or delusions, people with delusional disorder may continue to socialize and function in a normal manner and their behavior does not necessarily seem odd. However, the preoccupation with delusional ideas can be disruptive to their overall lives.

For the diagnosis to be made, auditory and visual hallucinations cannot be prominent, though olfactory or tactile hallucinations related to the content of the delusion may be present. The delusions cannot be due to the effects of a drug, medication, or general medical condition, and delusional disorder cannot be diagnosed in an individual previously properly diagnosed with schizophrenia. A person with delusional disorder may be high functioning in daily life. Recent and comprehensive meta-analyses of scientific studies point to an association with a deterioration in aspects of IQ in psychotic patients, in particular perceptual reasoning, although, the between-group differences were small.

According to German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin, patients with delusional disorder remain coherent, sensible and reasonable. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) defines six subtypes of the disorder: erotomanic (belief that someone is in love with one), grandiose (belief that one is the greatest, strongest, fastest, richest, or most intelligent person ever), jealous (belief that one is being cheated on), persecutory (delusions that one or someone one is close to is being malevolently treated in some way), somatic (belief that one has a disease or medical condition), and mixed, i.e., having features of more than one subtype.

Delusions also occur as symptoms of many other mental disorders, especially the other psychotic disorders.

The DSM-IV and psychologists agree that personal beliefs should be evaluated with great respect to cultural and religious differences, as some cultures have normalized beliefs that may be considered delusional in other cultures.

An earlier, now-obsolete, nosological name for delusional disorder was &quot;paranoia&quot;. This should not be confused with the modern definition of paranoia (i.e., persecutory ideation specifically).

==Classification==
The International Classification of Diseases classifies delusional disorder as a mental and behavioural disorder.
Diagnosis of a specific type of delusional disorder can sometimes be made based on the content of the delusions, to wit, the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) enumerates seven types:
* Erotomanic type (erotomania): delusion that another person, often a prominent figure, is in love with the individual. The individual may breach the law as they try to obsessively make contact with the desired person.
* Grandiose type (megalomania): delusion of inflated worth, power, knowledge, identity or believing oneself to be a famous person, claiming the actual person is an impostor or an impersonator.
* Jealous type: delusion that the individual&#x27;s sexual partner is unfaithful when it is untrue. The patient may follow the partner, check text messages, emails, phone calls etc. in an attempt to find &quot;evidence&quot; of the infidelity.
* Persecutory type: This delusion is a common subtype. It includes the belief that the person (or someone to whom the person is close) is being malevolently treated in some way. The patient may believe that they have been drugged, spied upon, harmed, harassed and so on and may seek &quot;justice&quot; by making reports, taking action or even acting violently.
* Somatic type: delusions that the person has some physical defect or general medical condition
* Mixed type: delusions with characteristics of more than one of the above types but with no one theme predominating.
* Unspecified type: delusions that cannot be clearly determined or characterized in any of the categories in the specific types.

==Signs and symptoms==
The following can indicate a delusion:
# An individual expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force, even when evidence suggests the contrary.
# That idea appears to have an undue influence on the person&#x27;s life, and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent.
# Despite their profound conviction, there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the person is questioned about it.
# The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive, especially about the belief.
# There is a quality of &quot;centrality&quot;: no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to the person, they accept them relatively unquestioningly.
# An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, often with irritability and hostility. They will not accept any other opinions.
# The belief is, at the least, unlikely, and out of keeping with the individual&#x27;s social, cultural, and religious background.
# The person is emotionally over-invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of their psyche.
# The delusion, if acted out, often leads to behaviors which are abnormal, and out of character, although perhaps understandable in light of the delusional beliefs.
# Other people who know the individual observe that the belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien.

Additional characteristic of delusional disorder include the following:
# It is a primary disorder.
# It is a stable disorder characterized by the presence of delusions to which the patient clings with extraordinary tenacity.
# The illness is chronic and frequently lifelong.
# The delusions are logically constructed and internally consistent.
# The delusions do not interfere with general logical reasoning (although within the delusional system the logic is perverted) and there is usually no general disturbance of behavior. If disturbed behavior does occur, it is directly related to the delusional beliefs.
# The individual experiences a heightened sense of self-reference. Events which, to others, are nonsignificant are of enormous significance to them, and the atmosphere surrounding the delusions is highly charged.

However, this should not be confused with gaslighting, where a person denies the truth, and causes the one being gaslit to think that they are being delusional.

==Causes==

The cause of delusional disorder is unknown, but genetic, biochemical, and environmental factors may play a significant role in its development. Some people with delusional disorders may have an imbalance in neurotransmitters, the chemicals that send and receive messages to the brain. There does seem to be some familial component, and immigration (generally for persecutory reasons), drug abuse, excessive stress, being married, being employed, low socioeconomic status, celibacy among men, and widowhood among women may also be risk factors. Delusional disorder is currently thought to be on the same spectrum or dimension as schizophrenia, but people with delusional disorder, in general, may have less symptomatology and functional disability.

==Diagnosis==

Differential diagnosis includes ruling out other causes such as drug-induced conditions, dementia, infections, metabolic disorders, and endocrine disorders. Other psychiatric disorders must then be ruled out. In delusional disorder, mood symptoms tend to be brief or absent, and unlike schizophrenia, delusions are non-bizarre and hallucinations are minimal or absent.

Interviews are important tools to obtain information about the patient&#x27;s life situation and history to help make a diagnosis. Clinicians generally review earlier medical records to gather a full history. Clinicians also try to interview the patient&#x27;s immediate family, as this can be helpful in determining the presence of delusions. The mental status examination is used to assess the patient&#x27;s current mental condition.

A psychological questionnaire used in the diagnosis of the delusional disorder is the Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI) which focuses on identifying and understanding delusional thinking. However, this questionnaire is more likely used in research than in clinical practice.

In terms of diagnosing a non-bizarre delusion as a delusion, ample support should be provided through fact checking. In case of non-bizarre delusions, Psych Central notes, &quot;All of these situations could be true or possible, but the person suffering from this disorder knows them not to be (e.g., through fact-checking, third-person confirmation, etc.).&quot;

==Treatment==
A challenge in the treatment of delusional disorders is that most patients have limited insight, and do not acknowledge that there is a problem. Most patients are treated as out-patients, although hospitalization may be required in some cases if there is a risk of harm to self or others. Individual psychotherapy is recommended rather than group psychotherapy, as patients are often quite suspicious and sensitive. Antipsychotics are not well tested in delusional disorder, but they do not seem to work very well, and often have no effect on the core delusional belief. Antipsychotics may be more useful in managing agitation that can accompany delusional disorder. Until further evidence is found, it seems reasonable to offer treatments which have efficacy in other psychotic disorders.

There is a certain amount of evidence that alternative treatment-regimes (beyond conventional attempted treatment with antipsychotics) may include clomipramine for people with the somatic subtype of paranoia. There is a dearth of well-published studies investigating the effectiveness of trimipramine; another derivative of tricyclic-antidepressant imipramine and one which has modest anti-psychotic properties weakly analogous to those of clozapine; in delusional disorder per-se. However, trimipramine was compared to a combination of amitriptyline and haloperidol in a double-blinded trial involving patients with severe, psychotic depression (specifically with customary delusional features) and appeared favourable in its treatment.

Psychotherapy for patients with delusional disorder can include cognitive therapy which is conducted with the use of empathy. During the process, the therapist can ask hypothetical questions in a form of therapeutic Socratic questioning. This therapy has been mostly studied in patients with the persecutory type. The combination of pharmacotherapy with cognitive therapy integrates treating the possible underlying biological problems and decreasing the symptoms with psychotherapy as well. Psychotherapy has been said to be the most useful form of treatment because of the trust formed in a patient and therapist relationship.

Supportive therapy has also been shown to be helpful. Its goal is to facilitate treatment adherence and provide education about the illness and its treatment.

Furthermore, providing social skills training has been found to be helpful for many people. It can promote interpersonal competence as well as confidence and comfort when interacting with those individuals perceived as a threat.

Insight-oriented therapy is rarely indicated or contraindicated; yet there are reports of successful treatment. Its goals are to develop therapeutic alliance, containment of projected feelings of hatred, powerlessness, and badness; measured interpretation as well as the development of a sense of creative doubt in the internal perception of the world. The latter requires empathy with the patient&#x27;s defensive position.

==Epidemiology==
Delusional disorders are uncommon in psychiatric practice, though this may be an underestimation due to the fact that those with the condition lack insight and thus avoid psychiatric assessment. The prevalence of this condition stands at about 24 to 30 cases per 100,000 people while 0.7 to 3.0 new cases per 100,000 people are reported every year. Delusional disorder accounts for 1–2% of admissions to inpatient mental health facilities. The incidence of first admissions for delusional disorder is lower, from 0.001 to 0.003%.

Delusional disorder tends to appear in middle to late adult life, and for the most part first admissions to hospital for delusional disorder occur between age 33 and 55. It is more common in women than men, and immigrants seem to be at higher risk.

==Criticism==
In some situations, the delusion may turn out to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that the partner is being unfaithful (in extreme cases perhaps going so far as to follow the partner into the bathroom, believing the other to be seeing a lover even during the briefest of separations), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.

In other cases, a belief may be incorrectly deemed delusional by a doctor or psychiatrist who subjectively concludes that a patient&#x27;s assertions are unlikely, bizarre, or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person&#x27;s claims leading some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, named after the wife of US Attorney General John Mitchell and derived from the initial response to her allegations of illegal activity taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness; only after the Watergate scandal broke were her claims corroborated and her sanity thus confirmed.

Similar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers&#x27; definition of delusion as being ultimately &#x27;un-understandable&#x27;. Critics (such as R. D. Laing) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the subjective understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable.

Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in &quot;normal&quot; beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist Anthony David to write that &quot;there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 2010 psychological thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, delusional disorder is portrayed along with other disorders. An Indian movie &quot;Anantaram&quot; (Thereafter) directed by Adoor Gopalakrishnan also portrays the complex nature of delusions. The plot of the French movie &quot;He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not&quot; revolves around a case of erotomania, as does the plot of the Ian McEwan novel, &quot;Enduring Love&quot;.

<text>Reverend Charles Pritchard (29 February 1808 – 28 May 1893) was a British astronomer, clergyman, and educational reformer. He founded the Clapham Grammar School in 1834 and included sciences in the curriculum. A chapel was erected in 1846.

== Biography ==
He was born at Alberbury, Shropshire, fourth son of William Pritchard, a failed manufacturer who later moved to London where he attended the Merchant Taylor&#x27;s School and Poplar Academy where he was taught by John Stock, the progressive educationalist. Pritchard later described his studies as consisting of &quot;a systematic course of instruction relating to physical phenomena&quot;. At sixteen he was enrolled as a sizar at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1830 as fourth wrangler. In 1832 he was elected a fellow of his college, and in the following year he was ordained, and became head of a private school at Stockwell. From 1834 to 1862 he was headmaster of Clapham grammar school. He then retired to Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, and took an active interest in the affairs of the Royal Astronomical Society, of which he became honorary secretary in 1862 and president in 1866. His sister, Margaret died this same year.

His career as a professional astronomer began in 1870, when he was elected Savilian professor of astronomy at the University of Oxford. At his request the university decided to build a fine equatorial telescope for the instruction of his class and for purposes of research, a scheme which, as a result of Warren de la Rue&#x27;s munificent gift of instruments from his private observatory at Cranford, expanded into the establishment of the new university observatory. By De la Rue&#x27;s advice, Pritchard began his career there with a determination of the physical libration of the moon, or the nutation of its axis.

In 1882 Pritchard commenced a systematic study of stellar photometry. For this purpose he employed an instrument known as the &quot;wedge photometer&quot;, with which he measured the relative brightness of 2,784 stars between the North Pole and about -10° declination. The results were published in 1885 in his &quot;Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis&quot;, and their importance was recognized by the bestowal in 1886 upon him, conjointly with Professor Pickering, of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.

He then decided to experiment with applying photography to the determination of stellar parallax. With the object of testing the capabilities of the method, he took for his first essay the well-known star 61 Cygni, and his results agreed so well with those previously attained that he undertook the systematic measurement of the parallaxes of second-magnitude stars, and published the outcome in the third and fourth volumes of the &quot;Publications of the Oxford University Observatory&quot;. Although some lurking errors impaired the authority of the concluded parallaxes this work ranks as a valuable contribution to astronomy, since it showed the possibility of employing photography in such delicate investigations.

When an international survey of the heavens was proposed, the zone between 25° and 31° north declination was allotted to him, and at the time of his death some progress had been made in recording its included stars. Pritchard became a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1883, and an honorary fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1886. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1840, and in 1892 was awarded one of the royal medals for his work on photometry and stellar parallax.

== Family ==
A son, Sir Charles Bradley Pritchard, was an administrator in British India.

<text>Ruby Florence Murray (29 March 1935 – 17 December 1996) was a Northern Irish singer. One of the most popular singers in Britain and Ireland in the 1950s, she scored ten hits in the UK Singles Chart between 1954 and 1959. She also made pop chart history in March 1955 by having five hits in the Top Twenty in a single week.

==Child star==
Ruby Florence Murray was born near the Donegall Road in south Belfast, the youngest child in a Protestant family. She underwent surgery at six weeks of age due to swollen glands and, as a result, had a very husky voice. Entering a public speaking contest run by Eglinton Young Farmers Club, Londonderry in March 1947, she won a special prize for the youngest competitor under 18. A performance at the Ballymena Variety Theatre in February 1948 received a wonderful reception and she then toured in Northern Ireland as a child singer. Murray first appeared on television at the age of 12, having been spotted by producer Richard Afton. Owing to laws governing children performing, Murray had to delay her start in the entertainment industry. She returned to Belfast and full-time education until she was 14.

==Chart success==
Murray kept busy on the variety stage in Northern Ireland in the early 1950s and in 1954 she joined a touring revue called &quot;Yankee Doodle Blarney&quot; which gave her very useful exposure on the English variety stages. Richard Afton offered her the position of resident singer on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Quite Contrary&quot; television show, to replace Joan Regan. After being again spotted by Ray Martin on the first &quot;Quite Contrary&quot; show, Murray was signed to Columbia and her first single, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1954. &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;, her second single, reached number one in early 1955. That year Murray set a pop chart record by having five hits in the Top Twenty in one week, a feat unmatched for many years. In 2014, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; issued three certificates confirming that at the date of issue, nobody had beaten this record, although it was shared with three other singers. The record by a female singer still until 2022.

The 1950s was a busy period for Murray, during which she had her own television show, starred at the London Palladium with Norman Wisdom, appeared in a Royal Command Performance (1955) and toured the world. In a period of 52 weeks, starting on 3 December 1954 and lasting until the end of November 1955, Murray constantly had at least one single in the UK charts – this at a time when only a Top 20 was listed.

Murray appeared as &quot;Ruby&quot; in her only film role, &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot;, a 1956 farce with Frankie Howerd and Dennis Price. A couple of hits followed later in the decade; &quot;Goodbye Jimmy, Goodbye&quot;, a No. 10 hit in 1959, was her final appearance in the charts.
EMI put together a compilation album of her hits on CD in 1989, including songs that regularly featured in her act; &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Scarlet Ribbons&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Irish in Me&quot;. They updated this with the release of &quot;EMI Presents The Magic of Ruby Murray&quot; in 1997 and a four CD album, &quot;Anthology – The Golden Anniversary Collection&quot;, in 2005, the 50th anniversary of her peak successes on the charts.

==Legacy==
Murray&#x27;s popularity led to her name being adopted in Cockney rhyming slang as a rhyme for &quot;curry&quot;. The phrase &quot;have a ruby&quot; appears in various episodes of the BBC TV comedy series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. It also appeared in another BBC sitcom series, &quot;The Royle Family&quot;.

A play about Murray&#x27;s life, &quot;Ruby&quot;, written by the Belfast playwright Marie Jones, opened at the Group Theatre in Belfast in April 2000. A second play, by Michael Cameron, opened in Belfast on 13 February 2019 and was sold out at all performances.

Virgin Atlantic G-VYUM a Boeing 787-9 is named the “Ruby Murray” in her honour. 

==Personal life==
In 1957, while working in Blackpool, Murray met Bernie Burgess, a member of a successful television and recording vocal quartet, the Four Jones Boys. Shortly afterwards she left Northern Ireland to marry him and live in Northampton. Burgess, contrary to press reports, did not become her manager, but rather his role was that of a supporting husband. The couple included a song-and-dance segment in Murray&#x27;s act during the 1960s.

Murray struggled with alcoholism for most of her life and this contributed to the breakdown of her marriage in 1974. The divorce was finalised in 1976 and Murray moved to Torquay to live with an old friend, Ray Lamar, a former stage dancer and theatre impresario, who was 18 years her senior. They married in 1991 and spent the evening with a small party of friends and family at an Italian restaurant in Babbacombe.

Murray had two children from her marriage to Burgess, Julie (b. 1960) and Tim (b. 1965). Tim died unexpectedly from a heart condition in July 2020, aged 55.

Although her days as a major star were long over, Murray continued performing until close to the end of her life, spending her last couple of years in Asprey&#x27;s Nursing Home. She died of liver cancer on 17 December 1996, aged 61.

Lamar died on 3 August 2005 aged 87. Burgess died on 19 July 2024 aged 95.

<text>Hagakure (Kyūjitai: ; Shinjitai: ; meaning &quot;Hidden by the Leaves&quot; or &quot;Hidden Leaves&quot;), or , is a practical and spiritual guide for a warrior, drawn from a collection of commentaries by the clerk Yamamoto Tsunetomo, former retainer to Nabeshima Mitsushige (July 10, 1632 – July 2, 1700), the third ruler of what is now Saga Prefecture in Japan. compiled these commentaries from his conversations with Tsunetomo from 1709 to 1716; however, it was not published until many years afterwards. Written during a time when there was no officially sanctioned samurai fighting, the book grapples with the dilemma of maintaining a warrior class in the absence of war and reflects the author&#x27;s nostalgia for a world that had disappeared before he was born. &quot;Hagakure&quot; was largely forgotten for two centuries after its composition, but it came to be viewed as the definitive guide of the armed forces of the Empire of Japan during the Pacific War. &quot;Hagakure&quot; is also known as &quot;The Book of the Samurai&quot;, &quot;Analects of Nabeshima&quot; or &quot;Hagakure Analects&quot;.

==Content==
The book records Yamamoto&#x27;s views on bushido, the warrior code of the samurai. &quot;Hagakure&quot; is sometimes said to assert that bushido is really the &quot;Way of Dying&quot; or living as though one was already dead, and that a samurai must be willing to die at any moment in order to be true to his lady/lord. His saying &quot;the way of the warrior is death&quot; was a summation of the willingness to sacrifice that &quot;bushido&quot; codified. &quot;Hagakure&quot;″s text is occasionally misinterpreted as meaning that bushido is a code of death. However, the true meaning is that by having a constant awareness of death, people can achieve a transcendent state of freedom, whereby &quot;it is possible to perfectly fulfill one&#x27;s calling as a warrior.&quot;

==Historical context==
After the Tokugawa shogunate suppressed the Shimabara Rebellion in 1638, Japan experienced no warfare for about two centuries. Private feuding and dueling between samurai was also suppressed. Yamamoto Tsunetomo was born in 1659, after the end of officially sanctioned samurai fighting. He had no personal combat experience and when he was employed, he worked as a scribe. By the late 1600s and early 1700s, samurai faced the dilemma of maintaining a warrior class in the absence of war, and &quot;Hagakure&quot; reflects this uncertainty. Written late in the author&#x27;s life, the book also reflects his nostalgia for a world that had disappeared before his birth.

==Reception==
&quot;Hagakure&quot; was largely forgotten for two centuries. The first modern edition appeared in 1900, and it did not receive much attention during the first decades of the century. &quot;Hagakure&quot; came to be viewed as a definitive book of the samurai only during the Pacific War. According to Mark Ravina, &quot;Rather than an account of samurai tradition, this work serves as an example of what the Japanese army thought Japanese soldiers should believe about samurai practice.&quot; In the post-war era, the nationalist author and poet, Yukio Mishima, was inspired by &quot;Hagakure&quot; and wrote his own book in praise of the work. Quotations from &quot;Hagakure&quot; are used as a narrative device in the 1999 American gangster film &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;.

<doc id="251053" wikidata="Q708101" url="?curid=251053" title="George Grove">
<text>Sir George Grove (13 August 182028 May 1900) was an English engineer and writer on music, known as the founding editor of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;.

Grove was trained as a civil engineer, and successful in that profession, but his love of music drew him into musical administration. When responsible for the regular orchestral concerts at the Crystal Palace, he wrote a series of programme notes from which eventually grew his musical dictionary. His interest in the music of Franz Schubert, which was neglected in England at that point in the nineteenth century, led him and his friend Arthur Sullivan to go to Vienna in search of undiscovered Schubert manuscripts. Their researches led to their discovery of the lost score of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot; music, several of his symphonies and other music in 1867, leading to a revival of interest in Schubert&#x27;s work.

Grove was the first director of the Royal College of Music, from its foundation in 1883 until his retirement in 1894. He recruited leading musicians including Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford as members of the College faculty and established a close working relationship with London&#x27;s older conservatoire, the Royal Academy of Music.

In addition to his musical work, Grove had a deep and scholarly knowledge of the Bible. He contributed to the English literature on the subject, including a concordance in 1854 and about a thousand pages of Sir William Smith&#x27;s 1863 &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot;. He was a co-founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Grove was born in Clapham, the eighth of the eleven children of Thomas Grove (1774–1852), fishmonger and venison dealer, and his wife, Mary ( Blades; 1784–1856). A younger sister, Eleanor, was the founding principal of College Hall, London.

He went to a preparatory school, on Clapham Common, where one of his schoolfellows was George Granville Bradley, later Dean of Westminster, whose sister Grove subsequently married. He next entered Stockwell (later known as Clapham) Grammar School, run by Charles Pritchard, the astronomer, who was inspired by the progressive principles of King&#x27;s College, London. The educational curriculum was based on classics, divinity, mathematics and natural philosophy, and rigorously tested by annual examination. Pritchard also encouraged his pupils to develop interests in literature and music.

Grove was a regular worshipper at Holy Trinity, Clapham, where he listened to the music of Bach and Handel. By the age of sixteen, he was competent in classics and mathematics; he left the school in 1836 and was apprenticed to Alexander Gordon, a well-known civil engineer in Westminster. In his free time, he immersed himself in music, attending concerts and studying scores.

After completing his apprenticeship, Grove was admitted as a graduate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, in 1839. A year later he went to Glasgow, gaining further experience in the factory of Robert Napier. In 1841, Grove had an affair with a woman called Elizabeth Blackwell, who gave birth to his illegitimate son, George Grove Blackwell, in March 1842. Between 1841 and 1846, Grove spent most of his time in the West Indies, as resident engineer during the building of cast-iron lighthouses.

After this he joined the staff of the Chester and Holyhead Railway and then became assistant to Edwin Clark, working on the Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait. An account of the first floating of the tubes of the bridge is recorded in &quot;The Spectator&quot; of 23 June 1849, which was Grove&#x27;s first appearance in print. During this period, he lived in Chester, hearing music in the cathedral and also becoming familiar with Welsh folksong.

===Music and biblical scholarship===
While working on the Britannia Bridge Grove came into contact with Robert Stephenson, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Sir Charles Barry and other eminent visitors to the works. &quot;These distinguished men&quot;, Grove later recalled, &quot;noticed me and were as good as gold to me. They counselled me to go to London and forced me into the secretaryship of the Society of Arts, then vacant by the retirement of Mr. Scott Russell.&quot; This was in 1849, when the Great Exhibition of 1851 was in preparation. Grove was the society&#x27;s secretary for the duration of the exhibition. 

On 23 December 1851, he married Harriet Bradley, the sister of his old school friend George Bradley. After the Great Exhibition closed in 1852, its principal building, known as &quot;the Crystal Palace&quot;, was dismantled and rebuilt in the south London suburb of Sydenham as a centre for education, the arts and leisure. Grove was appointed secretary of the Crystal Palace. He engaged a wind band and a conductor, Heinrich Schallehn. The latter was found to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by August Manns, who, with Grove&#x27;s encouragement, developed the band into a full-sized symphony orchestra. With programmes chosen by Grove and Manns, the Crystal Palace concerts became a central feature of London&#x27;s musical scene and remained so until the end of the century. 

Grove wrote the programme notes for the concerts. In 1901, a biographer wrote:

:The daily and weekly orchestral performances at Sydenham prompted those admirable analytical notices of musical compositions with which the name of George Grove was so long and is so favourably associated. He had always shown a great fondness for music, but had never received any technical training in the art. Entirely self-taught, his knowledge was acquired solely by &#x27;picking up&#x27; information. &quot;I wish it to be distinctly understood,&quot; he said, &quot;that I have always been a mere amateur in music. I wrote about the symphonies and concertos because I wished to try to make them clear to myself and to discover the secret of the things that charmed me so; and from that sprang a wish to make other amateurs see it in the same way.&quot;

Grove&#x27;s musical analyses avoided all hint of technical jargon and tried to make clear to everyone who read them what, in Grove&#x27;s opinion, listeners should be aware of in each piece. In a note on Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 39, after referring to Mozart&#x27;s extraordinary productivity in the year 1788, Grove wrote:
:The circumstances which necessitated such fearful exertion on this and many other occasions in Mozart&#x27;s life we have no means of ascertaining. Whatever they were, they were in accordance with a common custom of Nature. She seems to delight in condemning her most gifted sons to an ordeal the very reverse of that which we should anticipate. It seems equally true in Art and in Morals, that it is not by indulgence and favour, but by difficulty and trouble, that the spirit is formed; and in all ages of the world our Davids, Shakspeares, Dantes, Mozarts, and Beethovens must submit to processes which none but their great spirits could survive – to a fiery trial of poverty, ill health, neglect, and misunderstanding – and be &quot;tried as silver is tried,&quot; that they may become the teachers of their fellow-men to all time, and shine, like stars in the firmament, for ever and ever.

Grove&#x27;s Crystal Palace programme notes did not concentrate solely on his favourite Austro-German composers. He embraced a representative selection of composers, notably the Frenchmen Berlioz, Bizet, Delibes, Gounod, Massenet and Saint-Saëns, and the rising generations of British composers – Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Hamish MacCunn, Edward German and Granville Bantock.

Among the composers whom Grove sought to popularise was Schubert, whose music was largely neglected in England. Grove and Manns presented the first performance in England of the &quot;Great&quot; C major Symphony. Together with his friend Arthur Sullivan, Grove went to Vienna in 1867 in search of Schubert manuscripts. They found several of Schubert&#x27;s symphonies and much other music, some of which they copied. They were particularly excited about their final discovery, which Grove described thus: &quot;I found, at the bottom of the cupboard, and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music-books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century. … These were the part-books of the whole of the music in &quot;Rosamunde&quot;, tied up after the second performance in December, 1823, and probably never disturbed since. Dr. Schneider [Schubert&#x27;s nephew] must have been amused at our excitement; but let us hope that he recollected his own days of rapture; at any rate, he kindly overlooked it, and gave us permission to take away with us and copy what we wanted.&quot;

In the early years of the Crystal Palace, Grove devoted much of his leisure time to Biblical scholarship. Discovering that there was no full concordance of the proper names in the Bible, Grove, helped by his wife, began work in 1853 making a complete index of each occurrence of every proper name in the Bible, including the Apocrypha. Between 1860 and 1863, Grove was assistant editor to Sir William Smith in a comprehensive Bible dictionary, contributing more than a thousand pages. Some entries written by Grove, such as that on the prophet Elijah, were equivalent almost to book-length. He visited the Holy Land in 1859 and 1861, and helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he became honorary secretary, labouring incessantly on its behalf. The Archbishop of York said that Grove was &quot;virtually the founder and institutor of the Society, and has done wonders for it throughout.&quot; Grove later observed, &quot;People will insist on thinking of me as a musician, which I really am not in the very least degree. I took quite as much interest in my investigations into the natural features and the little towns of Palestine which I did for &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dictionary of the Bible&quot; or for Arthur Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Sinai and Palestine,&quot; as I did for Beethoven and Mendelssohn, indeed perhaps more so.&quot;

===&quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;===
After nearly twenty years of service at the Crystal Palace, Grove resigned the secretaryship at the end of 1873 and accepted an offer from the publishers Macmillan and Co. to join their staff and become a director of the firm. He edited &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and wrote a primer of geography for Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;History Primers&quot;. By far the most important outcome of his connection with Macmillan was &quot;A Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, for which his name is best remembered. The idea of the dictionary was entirely his own. He stated, in the prospectus of the dictionary, in March 1874, that &quot;The want of English works on the history, theory, or practice of Music, or the biographies of musicians accessible to the non-professional reader, has long been a subject of remark.&quot;

Grove conceived of a work to fill the gap he had identified; he originally proposed two volumes of about 600 pages each, but by the time of its first publication, it ran to four volumes containing a total of 3,125 pages. It was issued by Macmillan in alphabetical volumes over a 12-year period ending in 1889. Grove criticised Parry, a leading contributor, for being &quot;inclined to be wordy and diffuse&quot;, but articles by Grove on his own particular interests, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Schubert, were even longer. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote of the work, &quot;His masterly biographies of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schubert are models of biographical literature, and are written in a most fascinating style. He made two special journeys to Germany to obtain materials for his Mendelssohn article, and more than two to Vienna in connection with Schubert and Beethoven.&quot;

===Royal College of Music===

In the 1880s, London&#x27;s musical academies were in poor shape. The Royal Academy of Music was moribund, and the National Training School for Music, of which Sullivan was the reluctant and ineffectual head, was in financial and administrative difficulties. There was a proposal to merge the two bodies to create a single effective conservatoire, but the Royal Academy insisted on retaining its independence and later revitalised itself under the leadership of Alexander Mackenzie. The National Training School was re-formed as the Royal College of Music in 1882, and Grove was appointed its first director. Throughout 1882 he led a successful fund-raising campaign that ensured the official opening of the new college by the Prince of Wales on 7 May 1883. Grove received a knighthood on the same day. The teaching staff, whom he appointed, were led by Parry and Stanford, and, as a biographer of Grove says, &quot;carried the college with distinction into the twentieth century.&quot;

Grove focused the college&#x27;s attention on two main activities: practical training and examining. He was determined to raise the general standard of orchestral playing by replacing the existing &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods of apprentice-based training, private lessons, or study abroad. His second focus, examination, followed the Victorian trend to form professional bodies regulating and standardising the activity of members of each profession. An example is the Institution of Civil Engineers to which Grove had been admitted in 1839. When the Royal Charter establishing the college was being drawn up, Grove ensured that, unlike the Royal Academy, the college should have degree-awarding powers. Mackenzie, seeing the prospect that the new institution would overshadow the Academy, successfully proposed that both bodies should award qualifications jointly. Grove agreed, realising that this course would do much to dispel the damaging hostility that existed between the Academy and the college.
The new Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music thus formed offered musical qualifications to external candidates from anywhere in the British Empire who could meet its rigorous standards. 1,141 candidates entered for the first examinations in 1890, despite the high entry fee of two guineas. The income helped both institutions to keep their own student fees at an affordable level, which enabled the college to make a full three-year course of study its basic standard. Because of the thorough training thus offered, the high standard of playing of the college&#x27;s students quickly became known. Leading musicians willingly appeared with the College orchestra, including Joseph Joachim and Hans Richter. Manns, Eugène Ysaÿe and Bernard Shaw praised it strongly. The historian David Wright says of Grove&#x27;s legacy: &quot;The founding of the RCM in 1883 clearly represents the major turning point for musical training in Britain. The new attitudes it espoused stemmed directly from the professionalizing ethos that modernized and transformed Victorian society.&quot;

===Retirement and last years===
Grove retired at Christmas 1894, when he was succeeded by Parry. By this time, a new building had been constructed for the college. Grove was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895. In 1896 Grove&#x27;s &quot;Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies&quot;, &quot;addressed to the amateurs of this country&quot;, appeared.

Early in 1899, Grove&#x27;s health began to fail, and he died, aged 79, on 28 May 1900, in the house at Sydenham in which he had lived for nearly 40 years. He was buried in Ladywell and Brockley Cemetery.

<doc id="251057" wikidata="Q1386779" url="?curid=251057" title="St. George Jackson Mivart">
<text>St. George Jackson Mivart (30 November 1827 – 1 April 1900) was an English biologist. He is famous for starting as an ardent believer in natural selection and later becoming one of its fiercest critics. Mivart attempted to reconcile the theory of evolution as propounded by Charles Darwin with the beliefs of the Catholic Church but was condemned by both Darwin and the Church. His belief in a soul created by God and insistence that evolutionism was not incompatible with the existence of such a God brought him into conflict with other evolutionists, while his theological theories on hell and on the compatibility between science and Catholicism led him to clash with the Church.

==Early life==
Mivart was born in London. His parents were Evangelicals, and his father was the wealthy owner of Mivart&#x27;s Hotel (now Claridge&#x27;s). His education started at the Clapham Grammar School and continued at Harrow School and King&#x27;s College London. Following his conversion to Catholicism, he was instructed at St. Mary&#x27;s, Oscott (1844–1846), and was confirmed there on 11 May 1845. His conversion automatically excluded him from the University of Oxford, then open only to members of the Anglican faith. His mother followed him into the Catholic Church in 1846.

==Appointments==

In 1851 he was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but he devoted himself to medical and biological studies. In 1862 he was appointed to the chair in zoology at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital medical school. In 1869 he became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and in 1874 he was appointed by Thomas John Capel as Professor of Biology at the short-lived Catholic University College, Kensington, a post he held until 1877.

He was vice-president of the Zoological Society twice (1869 and 1882); Fellow of the Linnean Society from 1862, secretary from 1874 to 1880, and vice-president in 1892. In 1867 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his work &quot;On the Appendicular skeleton of the Primates&quot;. This work was communicated to the society by Thomas Henry Huxley. Mivart was a member of the Metaphysical Society from 1874. He received the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy from Pope Pius IX in 1876, and of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Louvain in 1884.

==Controversy==
===Mivart and Huxley===
Mivart met Thomas Henry Huxley in 1859, and was initially a close follower and a believer in natural selection. &quot;Even as a professor he continued to attending Huxley&#x27;s lectures ... they became close friends, dining together and arranging family visits.&quot; However, Huxley was always strongly anti-Catholic, and no doubt this attitude led to Mivart becoming disenchanted with him. Once disenchanted, he lost little time in reversing on the subject of natural selection. In short, he now believed that a higher teleology was compatible with evolution.
As to &quot;natural selection&quot;, I accepted it completely and in fact my doubts &amp; difficulties were first excited by attending Prof. Huxley&#x27;s lectures at the School of Mines.

===Mivart&#x27;s alternative evolutionism===
Even before Mivart&#x27;s publication of &quot;On the Genesis of Species&quot; in 1871, he had published his new ideas in various periodicals. Huxley, Ray Lankester, and William Henry Flower had come out against his ideas, although O&#x27;Leary (2007) reports that &quot;their initial reaction to &quot;Genesis of Species&quot; was tolerant and impersonal&quot;.

Though admitting evolution in general, Mivart denied its applicability to the human intellect (a view also taken by Alfred Russell Wallace). His views as to the relationship between human nature and intellect and animal nature in general were given in his books &quot;Nature and Thought&quot; and &quot;Origin of Human Reason&quot;.

Mivart was someone Charles Darwin took seriously; Darwin prepared a point-by-point refutation which appeared in the sixth edition of &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. One of Mivart&#x27;s criticisms to which Darwin responded was a perceived failure of natural selection to explain the incipient stages of useful structures. Taking the eye as an example, Darwin was able to show many stages of light sensitivity and eye development in the animal kingdom as proof of the utility of less-than-perfect sight (argument by intermediate stages). Another was the supposed inability of natural selection to explain cases of parallel evolution, to which Huxley responded that the effect of natural selection in places with the same environment would tend to be similar.

Mivart&#x27;s hostile review of the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; aroused fury from his former intimates, including Darwin himself, who described it as &quot;grossly unfair&quot;. Mivart had quoted Darwin by shortening sentences and omitting words, causing Darwin to write: &quot;Though he means to be honourable, he is so bigoted that he cannot act fairly.&quot; Relationships between the two men were near breaking point. In response, Darwin arranged for the reprinting of a pamphlet by Chauncey Wright, previously issued in the US, which severely criticised &quot;Genesis of Species&quot;. Wright had, under Darwin&#x27;s guidance, clarified what was, and was not, &quot;Darwinism&quot;.

The quarrel reached a climax when Mivart lost his usual composure over what should have been a minor incident: In 1873, George Darwin (Charles&#x27; son) published a short article in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; suggesting that divorce should be made easier in cases of cruelty, abuse, or mental disorder. Mivart reacted with horror, using phrases like &quot;hideous sexual criminality&quot; and &quot;unrestrained licentiousness&quot;. Huxley wrote a counter-attack, and both Huxley and Darwin broke off connections with Mivart. Huxley blackballed Mivart&#x27;s attempt to join the Athenaeum Club.

===Mivart&#x27;s banned theological articles===
In 1892 and 1893 Mivart published three articles on &quot;Happiness in Hell&quot; in the journal &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot;. Mivart proposed that the punishments of hell were not eternal, and that hell is compatible with some kind of happiness.

These articles were placed on the &quot;Index Expurgatorius&quot;. This was the first official action of the Catholic Church against Mivart but it &quot;had nothing to do either with evolution or science&quot;. Later articles in January 1900 (&quot;The Continuity of Catholicism&quot; and &quot;Scripture and Roman Catholicism&quot; in &quot;The Nineteenth Century,&quot; and &quot;Some Recent Catholic Apologists&quot; in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;) led to his being placed under interdict by Cardinal Vaughan. These last articles were written, by Mivart&#x27;s own admission, in a provocative tone so that the authorities would have to act. In them, reversing his previous stance, he challenged the authority of the Church, concluding that the Bible and Catholic doctrine could not be reconciled with science.
:&quot;Without attempting to pass judgment on Mivart’s final stance, we can say that his attitude was not solely or principally determined by scientific motives and, more concretely, that evolution did not occupy a determining role in it.&quot;
The report of the consultor of the Holy Office dealing with Mivart&#x27;s case does not mention evolution.

==Death==
Mivart died of diabetes in London on 1 April 1900. His late heterodox opinions were a bar to his burial in consecrated ground. However, Sir William Broadbent gave medical testimony that these could be explained by the gravity and nature of the diabetes from which he had suffered.

After his death, a long final struggle took place between his friends and the church authorities. On 6 April 1900, his remains were deposited in catacomb Z beneath the Dissenters&#x27; Chapel, in the unconsecrated ground of the dissenters&#x27; section of the General Cemetery of All Souls, Kensal Green, in a public vault reserved for &#x27;temporary deposits&#x27; (most of which were destined for repatriation to mainland Europe or the Americas). His remains were finally transferred to St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, on 16 January 1904, for burial there on 18 January 1904.

==Legacy==
Mivart&#x27;s name is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Emoia mivarti&quot;.

<text>A piru is a fiend or demon in Finnish mythology. It was borrowed from Slavic mythology and was the counterpart of Perun, Slavic thunder god. However, piru lost its original meaning and refers to only demon in Finnish mythology.

In folklore, a piru is often featured as a nasty spirit of the forest with which a &quot;&quot; either wins or loses a battle of wits, giving or receiving a in return. In many cases, poltergeist and haunting phenomena are described as &quot;pirus&quot;. The Devil may be referred to as (proper noun) Piru, or &quot;Pääpiru&quot;, the main piru.

&quot;Piru&quot; is also a mild swearword in Finnish.

<doc id="251059" wikidata="Q1235089" url="?curid=251059" title="Herbert Vaughan">
<text>Herbert Alfred Henry Joseph Thomas Vaughan (15 April 1832 – 19 June 1903) was an English prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Westminster from 1892 until his death in 1903, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1893. He was the founder in 1866 of St Joseph&#x27;s Foreign Missionary Society, known best as the Mill Hill Missionaries. He also founded the Catholic Truth Society and St. Bede&#x27;s College, Manchester. As Archbishop of Westminster, he led the capital campaign and construction of Westminster Cathedral.

In 1871 Vaughan sent a group of Mill Hill priests to the United States to minister to freedmen. In 1893, the American branch of the society spun off, with Vaughan&#x27;s permission, to form the Society of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, whose members are known as Josephites.

==Early life and education==
Herbert Vaughan was born at Gloucester, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Francis Vaughan, of an old &quot;recusant&quot; (Catholic) family, the Vaughans of Courtfield, Herefordshire. His mother, Eliza Rolls from The Hendre, Monmouthshire, was a Catholic convert and intensely religious. All five of the Vaughan daughters became nuns, while six of the eight sons received Holy Orders and became priests. Two were later called as bishops in addition to Herbert: Roger became Archbishop of Sydney, Australia and John became titular bishop of Sebastopolis and auxiliary bishop in Salford, England. A nephew, Francis, became Bishop of Menevia, Wales.

In 1841 Herbert, the eldest, went to study for six years at Stonyhurst College, then to the Jesuit school of Brugelette, Belgium (1846–1848), and then with the Benedictines at Downside Abbey, near Bath, England.

In 1851 Vaughan went to Rome, and studied for two years at the Collegio Romano, where for a time he shared lodgings with the poet, Aubrey Thomas de Vere. He became a friend and disciple of Henry Edward Manning. Manning, a Catholic convert, became the second Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster following the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in Great Britain in 1850.

==Career==
Vaughan received Holy Orders at Lucca in 1854. On his return to England, he became Vice-President of St Edmund&#x27;s College, at that time the chief seminary in the south of England for candidates for the priesthood. Since childhood, Vaughan had been filled with zeal for foreign missions. He convinced Cardinal Wiseman and the bishops to agree to a proposal to build a seminary in England that would train priests to serve on missions throughout the British Empire. With this goal, he made a fund-raising trip to America in 1863, from which he returned with £11,000.

In 1868, Vaughan became proprietor of &quot;The Tablet&quot;. He wrote James McMaster, owner of the &quot;New York Freeman&#x27;s Journal and Catholic Register&quot;, &quot;No one can appreciate more highly than I do the great mission of the Catholic press in these days of steam and universal education.&quot;

He succeeded in opening St Joseph&#x27;s Foreign Missionary College, Mill Hill Park, London, in 1869. That same year, the Tenth Provincial Council of Baltimore passed a decree exhorting all bishops to establish missions and schools in their dioceses for African Americans. Subsequently, the Council Fathers wrote a letter requesting clergy for that purpose to Vaughan, superior general at Mill Hill. In 1871, Vaughan led a group of priests to the US to establish a mission society to minister to freedmen in the South.

In 1872 Vaughan was consecrated as the second Bishop of Salford, succeeding Bishop William Turner. Vaughan relinquished his position as superior at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, but in 1876 established St Bede&#x27;s College, conceived as a &quot;commercial school&quot; to prepare the sons of Manchester Catholics for a life in business and the professions. Vaughan chose to live at Hampton Grange, on the St. Bede&#x27;s College campus, with his own Bishop&#x27;s residence on Chapel Street in Salford being given over to a Seminary.

In 1879, as the most eminent local Catholic, Vaughan was chosen by the then Home Secretary, R.A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross, to be one of the trustees of the £1,000 compensation paid to a Whalley Range farm labourer, William Habron, pardoned for the murder of PC Nicholas Cock. In 1892 Vaughan succeeded Manning as Archbishop of Westminster, receiving the cardinal&#x27;s hat in 1893 as Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Santi Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio&quot;.

Vaughan was a man of different type from his predecessor; he had none of the &quot;ultramontane&quot; Manning&#x27;s intellectual finesse or his ardor for social reform. Vaughan did however have a more open attitude to women&#x27;s enfranchisement, reported as saying, &quot;I believe that the extension of the Parliamentary Franchise to women upon the same conditions as it is held by men would be a just and beneficial measure, tending to raise rather than to lower the course of national legislation.&quot; Vaughan was an ecclesiastic of remarkably fine presence and aristocratic leanings, intransigent in theological policy, and in personal character simply devout.

In 1893 the US Mill Hill mission, based in Baltimore, Maryland, reorganised with Vaughan&#x27;s blessing as an independent institution, known as Society of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart. Among its founders was the first African-American Catholic priest trained and ordained in the United States, Charles Uncles.

It was due to this theological &quot;purity&quot; that Vaughan assisted in scuttling an opportunity for rapprochement between Rome and the Church of England that was put into motion by a high-church Anglican, Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax and a French priest, Ferdinand Portal. Through the efforts of Vaughan and Archbishop of Canterbury Edward White Benson, this early form of ecumenism was put down. It culminated with the condemnation of Anglican Orders by Pope Leo XIII in his bull, Apostolicae curae.

It was Vaughan&#x27;s most cherished ambition to see an adequate Westminster Cathedral. He worked untiringly to secure subscriptions for a capital campaign, with the result that the foundation stone for the cathedral was laid in 1895. When Vaughan died in 1903 at the age of 71, the building was so far complete that a Requiem Mass was said there. His body was interred at the cemetery of St. Joseph&#x27;s College, the headquarters of the Mill Hill Missionaries in North London but it was moved back to the cathedral and reinterred in the Chapel of St Thomas of Canterbury (the &quot;Vaughan Chantry&quot;) in 2005.

<text>Glass-ceramics are polycrystalline materials produced through controlled crystallization of base glass, producing a fine uniform dispersion of crystals throughout the bulk material. Crystallization is accomplished by subjecting suitable glasses to a carefully regulated heat treatment schedule, resulting in the nucleation and growth of crystal phases. In many cases, the crystallization process can proceed to near completion, but in a small proportion of processes, the residual glass phase often remains. 

Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both glasses and ceramics. Glass-ceramics have an amorphous phase and one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called &quot;controlled crystallization&quot; in contrast to a spontaneous crystallization, which is usually not wanted in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics have the fabrication advantage of glass, as well as special properties of ceramics. When used for sealing, some glass-ceramics do not require brazing but can withstand brazing temperatures up to 700 °C. 

Glass-ceramics usually have between 30% ] and 90% [m/m] crystallinity and yield an array of materials with interesting properties like zero porosity, high strength, toughness, translucency or opacity, pigmentation, opalescence, low or even negative thermal expansion, high temperature stability, fluorescence, machinability, ferromagnetism, resorbability or high chemical durability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, ion conductivity, superconductivity, isolation capabilities, low dielectric constant and loss, corrosion resistance, high resistivity and break-down voltage. These properties can be tailored by controlling the base-glass composition and by controlled heat treatment/crystallization of base glass. In manufacturing, glass-ceramics are valued for having the strength of ceramic but the hermetic sealing properties of glass.

Glass-ceramics are mostly produced in two steps: First, a glass is formed by a glass-manufacturing process, after which the glass is cooled down. Second, the glass is put through a controlled heat treatment schedule. In this heat treatment the glass partly crystallizes. In most cases nucleation agents are added to the base composition of the glass-ceramic. These nucleation agents aid and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics have no pores, unlike sintered ceramics.

A wide variety of glass-ceramic systems exist, e.g., the Li2O × Al2O3 × &quot;n&quot;SiO2 system (LAS system), the MgO × Al2O3 × &quot;n&quot;SiO2 system (MAS system), and the ZnO × Al2O3 × &quot;n&quot;SiO2 system (ZAS system).

== History ==
Réaumur, a French chemist, made early attempts to produce polycrystalline materials from glass, demonstrating that if glass bottles were packed into a mixture of sand and gypsum, and subjected to red heat for several days, the glass bottles turned opaque and porcelain-like. Although Réaumur was successful in the conversion of glass to a polycrystalline material, he was unsuccessful in achieving the control of the crystallization process, which is a key step in producing true practical glass ceramics with the improved properties mentioned above.

The discovery of glass-ceramics is credited to a man named Donald Stookey, a renowned glass scientist who worked at Corning Inc. for 47 years. The first iteration stemmed from a glass material, Fotoform, which was also discovered by Stookey while he was searching for a photo-etch-able material to be used in television screens. Soon after the beginning of Fotoform, the first ceramic material was discovered when Stookey overheated a Fotoform plate in a furnace at 900 degrees Celsius and found an opaque, milky-white plate inside the furnace rather than the molten mess that was expected. While examining the new material, which Stookey aptly named Fotoceram, he took note that it was much stronger than the Fotoform that it was created from as it survived a short fall onto concrete.

In the late 1950s two more glass-ceramic materials would be developed by Stookey, one found use as the radome in the nose cone of missiles, while the other led to the line of consumer kitchenware known as Corningware. Corning executives announced Stookey&#x27;s discovery of the latter &quot;new basic material&quot; called Pyroceram which was touted as light, durable, capable of being an electrical insulator and yet thermally shock resistant. At the time, there were only few materials which offered the specific combination of characteristics that Pyroceram did and the material was rolled out as the Corningware kitchen line August 7, 1958.

Some of the success that Pyroceram brought inspired Corning to put an effort towards strengthening glass which became an effort by the technical director&#x27;s of Corning titled Project Muscle. A lesser known &quot;ultrastrong&quot; glass-ceramic material developed in 1962 called Chemcor (now known as Gorilla Glass) was produced by Corning&#x27;s glass team due to the Project Muscle effort. Chemcor would even be used to innovate the Pyroceram line of products as in 1961 Corning launched Centura Ware, a new line of Pyroceram that was lined with a glass laminate (invented by John MacDowell) and treated with the Chemcor process. Stookey continued to forge ahead in the discovery of the properties of glass-ceramics as he discovered how to make the material transparent in 1966. Though Corning would not release a product with his new innovation, for fear of cannibalizing Pyrex sales, until the late 1970s under the name Visions.

== Nucleation and crystal growth ==
The key to engineering a glass-ceramic material is controlling the nucleation and growth of crystals in the base glass. The amount of crystallinity will vary depending on the amount of nuclei present and the time and temperature at which the material is heated. It is important to understand the types of nucleation occurring in the material, whether it is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Homogeneous nucleation is a process resulting from the inherent thermodynamic instability of a glassy material. When enough thermal energy is applied to the system, the metastable glassy phase begins to return to the lower-energy, crystalline state. The term &quot;homogeneous&quot; is used here because the formation of nuclei comes from the base glass without any second phases or surfaces promoting their formation.

The rate of homogenous nucleation in a condensed system can be described with the following equation, proposed by Becker in 1938.

::formula_1

Where Q is the activation energy for diffusion across the phase boundary, A is a constant, and formula_2 is the maximum activation energy for formation of a stable nucleus, as given by the equation below.

::formula_3

Where formula_4 is the change of free energy per unit volume resulting from the transformation from one phase to the other, and formula_5 can be equated with interfacial tension.

Heterogeneous nucleation is a term used when a nucleating agent is introduced into the system to aid and control the crystallization process. The presence of this nucleating agent, in the form of an additional phase or surface, can act as a catalyst for nucleation and is particularly effective if there is epitaxy between the nucleus and the substrate. There are a number of metals that can act as nucleating agents in glass because they can exist in the glass in the form of particle dispersion of colloidal dimensions. Examples include copper, metallic silver, and platinum. It was suggested by Stookey in 1959 that the effectiveness of metallic nucleation catalysts relates to the similarities between the crystal structures of the metals and the phase being nucleated. 

The most important feature of heterogenous nucleation is that the interfacial tension between the heterogeneity and the nucleated phase is minimized. This means that the influence that the catalyzing surface has on the rate of nucleation is determined by the contact angle at the interface. Based on this, Turnbull and Vonnegut (1952) modified the equation for homogenous nucleation rate to give an expression for heterogenous nucleation rate.

::formula_6

If activation energy for diffusion is included, as suggested by Stokey (1959a), the equation then becomes:

::formula_7

From these equations, heterogeneous nucleation can be described in terms of the same parameters as homogeneous nucleation with a shape factor, which is a function of θ (contact angle). The term formula_8 is given by:

formula_9
if the nucleus has the form of a spherical cap.

In addition to nucleation, crystal growth is also required for the formation of glass ceramics. The crystal growth process is of considerable importance in determining the morphology of the produced glass ceramic composite material. Crystal growth is primarily dependent on two factors. First, it is dependent upon the rate at which the disordered structure can be re-arranged into a periodic lattice with longer-range order. Second, it is dependent upon the rate at which energy is released in the phase transformation (essentially the rate of cooling at the interface).

== Glass ceramics in medical applications ==
Glass-ceramics are used in medical applications due to their unique interaction, or lack thereof, with human body tissue. Bioceramics are typically placed into the following groups based on their biocompatibility: biopassive (bioinert), bioactive, or resorbable ceramics.

Biopassive (bioinert) ceramics are, as the name suggests, characterized by the limited interaction the material has with the surrounding biological tissue. Historically, these were the &quot;first generation&quot; biomaterials used as replacements for missing or damaged tissues. One problem resulting from using inert biomaterials was the body&#x27;s reaction to the foreign object; it was found that a phenomenon known as &quot;fibrous encapsulation&quot; would occur, where tissues would grow around the implant in an attempt to isolate the object from the rest of the body. This occasionally caused a variety of problems such as necrosis or sequestration of the implant. Two commonly used bioinert materials are alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2).

Bioactive materials have the ability to form bonds and interfaces with natural tissues. In the case of bone implants, two properties known as osteoconduction and osteoinduction play an important role in the success and longevity of the implant. Osteoconduction refers to a material&#x27;s ability to permit bone growth on the surface and into the pores and channels of the material. Osteoinduction is a term used when a material stimulates existing cells to proliferate, causing new bone to grow independently of the implant. In general, the bioactivity of a material is a result of a chemical reaction, typically dissolution of the implanted material. Calcium phosphate ceramics and bioactive glasses are commonly used as bioactive materials as they exhibit this dissolution behavior when introduced to living body tissue. One engineering goal relating to these materials is that the dissolution rate of the implant be closely matched to the growth rate of new tissue, leading to a state of dynamic equilibrium.

Resorbable ceramics are similar to bioactive ceramics in their interaction with the body, but the main difference lies in the extent to which the dissolution occurs. Resorbable ceramics are intended to gradually dissolve entirely, all the while new tissue grows in its stead. The architecture of these materials has become quite complex, with foam-like scaffolds being introduced to maximize the interfacial area between the implant and body tissue. One issue that arises from using highly porous materials for bioactive/resorbable implants is the low mechanical strength, especially in load-bearing areas such as the bones in the legs. An example of a resorbable material that has seen some success is tricalcium phosphate (TCP), however, it too falls short in terms of mechanical strength when used in high-stress areas.

== LAS system ==
The commercially most important system is the Li2O × Al2O3 × &quot;n&quot;SiO2 system (LAS system). The LAS system mainly refers to a mix of lithium, silicon, and aluminum oxides with additional components, e.g., glass-phase-forming agents such as Na2O, K2O and CaO and refining agents. As nucleation agents most commonly zirconium(IV) oxide in combination with titanium(IV) oxide is used. This important system was studied first and intensively by Hummel, and Smoke.

After crystallization the dominant crystal phase in this type of glass-ceramic is a high-quartz solid solution (HQ s.s.). If the glass-ceramic is subjected to a more intense heat treatment, this HQ s.s. transforms into a keatite-solid solution (K s.s., sometimes wrongly named as beta-spodumene). This transition is non-reversible and reconstructive, which means bonds in the crystal-lattice are broken and new arranged. However, these two crystal phases show a very similar structure as Li could show.

An interesting property of these glass-ceramics is their thermomechanical durability. Glass-ceramic from the LAS system is a mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 800–1000 °C. The dominant crystalline phase of the LAS glass-ceramics, HQ s.s., has a strong &quot;negative&quot; coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), keatite-solid solution as still a negative CTE but much higher than HQ s.s. These negative CTEs of the crystalline phase contrasts with the positive CTE of the residual glass. Adjusting the proportion of these phases offers a wide range of possible CTEs in the finished composite. Mostly for today&#x27;s applications a low or even zero CTE is desired. Also a negative CTE is possible, which means, in contrast to most materials when heated up, such a glass-ceramic contracts. At a certain point, generally between 60% [m/m] and 80% [m/m] crystallinity, the two coefficients balance such that the glass-ceramic as a whole has a thermal expansion coefficient that is very close to zero. Also, when an interface between material will be subject to thermal fatigue, glass-ceramics can be adjusted to match the coefficient of the material they will be bonded to.

Originally developed for use in the mirrors and mirror mounts of astronomical telescopes, LAS glass-ceramics have become known and entered the domestic market through its use in glass-ceramic cooktops, as well as cookware and bakeware or as high-performance reflectors for digital projectors.

== Ceramic matrix composites ==

One particularly notable use of glass-ceramics is in the processing of ceramic matrix composites. For many ceramic matrix composites typical sintering temperatures and times cannot be used, as the degradation and corrosion of the constituent fibres becomes more of an issue as temperature and sintering time increase. 
One example of this is SiC fibres, which can start to degrade via pyrolysis at temperatures above 1470K. One solution to this is to use the glassy form of the ceramic as the sintering feedstock rather than the ceramic, as unlike the ceramic the glass pellets have a softening point and will generally flow at much lower pressures and temperatures. This allows the use of less extreme processing parameters, making the production of many new technologically important fibre-matrix combinations by sintering possible.

== Glass ceramics in cooktops ==
Glass-ceramic from the LAS-System is a mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes, and its smooth glass-like surface is easy to clean, therefore it is often used as a cooktop surface.
The material has a very low heat conduction coefficient, which means that it stays cool outside the cooking area. It can be made nearly transparent (15–20% loss in a typical cooktop) for radiation in the infrared wavelengths. In the visible range glass-ceramics can be transparent, translucent or opaque and even colored by coloring agents.

However, glass-ceramic is not totally unbreakable. Because it is still a brittle material as glass and ceramics are, it can be broken – in particular it is less robust than traditional cooktops made of steel or cast iron. There have been instances where users reported damage to their cooktops when the surface was struck with a hard or blunt object (such as a can falling from above or other heavy items).

, there are two major types of electrical stoves with cooktops made of glass-ceramic:
* A radiant heating stove uses coils or infrared halogen lamps as the heating elements. The surface of the glass-ceramic cooktop above the burner heats up, but the adjacent surface remains cool because of the low heat conduction coefficient of the material.
* An induction stove heats a metal pot&#x27;s bottom directly through electromagnetic induction.

This technology is not entirely new, as glass-ceramic ranges were first introduced in the 1970s using Corningware tops instead of the more durable material used today. These first generation smoothtops were problematic and could only be used with flat-bottomed cookware as the heating was primarily conductive rather than radiative.

Compared to conventional kitchen stoves, glass-ceramic cooktops are relatively simple to clean, due to their flat surface. However, glass-ceramic cooktops can be scratched very easily, so care must be taken not to slide the cooking pans over the surface. If food with a high sugar content (such as jam) spills, it should never be allowed to dry on the surface, otherwise damage will occur.

For best results and maximum heat transfer, all cookware should be flat-bottomed and matched to the same size as the burner zone.

== Industry and material variations ==

Some well-known brands of glass-ceramics are Pyroceram, Ceran, Eurokera, Zerodur, and Macor. Nippon Electric Glass is a predominant worldwide manufacturer of glass ceramics, whose related products in this area include FireLite and NeoCeram , ceramic glass materials for architectural and high temperature applications respectively. Keralite, manufactured by Vetrotech Saint-Gobain, is a specialty glass-ceramic fire and impact safety rated material for use in fire-rated applications. Glass-ceramics manufactured in the Soviet Union/Russia are known under the name &quot;Sitall&quot;. Macor is a white, odorless, porcelain-like glass ceramic material and was developed originally to minimize heat transfer during crewed spaceflight by Corning Inc. StellaShine, launched in 2016 by Nippon Electric Glass Co., is a heat-resistant, glass-ceramic material with a thermal shock resistance of up to 800 degrees Celsius. This was developed as an addition to Nippon&#x27;s line of heat-resistant cooking range plates along with materials like Neoceram. KangerTech is an ecigarette manufacturer which began in Shenzhen, China which produces glass ceramic materials and other special hardened-glass applications like vaporizer modification tanks.

The same class of material is also used in Visions and CorningWare glass-ceramic cookware, allowing it to be taken from the freezer directly to the stovetop or oven with no risk of thermal shock while maintaining the transparent look of glassware.

<text>William Thomson, (11 February 1819 – 25 December 1890) was an English church leader, Archbishop of York from 1862 until his death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born the eldest son of John Thompson [sic] of Kelswick House, near Whitehaven, Cumberland, and educated at Shrewsbury School and at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, of which he became a scholar. He took his B.A. degree in 1840, and was soon afterwards made fellow of his college. He was ordained in 1842, and worked as a curate at Cuddesdon. In 1847 he was made tutor of his college, and in 1853 he delivered the Bampton lectures, his subject being &quot;The Atoning Work of Christ viewed in Relation to some Ancient Theories&quot;. These lectures established his reputation.

===Career===
Thomson&#x27;s activity was not confined to theology. He was made fellow of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society. He also wrote a very popular &quot;Outline of the Laws of Thought&quot; (1842). He sided with the party at Oxford which favoured university reform, but this did not prevent him from being appointed provost of his college in 1855. In 1858 he was made preacher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and a volume of his sermons was published in 1861. In the same year he edited &quot;Aids to Faith&quot;, a volume written in opposition to &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, the progressive sentiments of which had stirred up controversy in the Church of England.

In December 1861 he became Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and within a year he was elevated to Archbishop of York. In this position his moderate orthodoxy led him to join Archbishop Archibald Campbell Tait in supporting the Public Worship Regulation Act, and, as president of the northern convocation, he came frequently into sharp collision with the lower house of that body. But if he thus incurred the hostility of the High Church party among the clergy, he was admired by the laity for his strong sense, his clear and forcible reasoning, and his wide knowledge, and he remained to the last a power in the north of England. In his later years he published an address read before the members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1868), one on &quot;Design in Nature&quot;, for the Christian Evidence Society, which reached a fifth edition, various charges and pastoral addresses, and he was one of the projectors of the &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Commentary&quot;, for which he wrote the &quot;Introduction to the Synoptic Gospels.&quot;

See the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (April 1892).

==Family==
His parents were John Thompson (sic, 1791–1878) and Isabella Thompson (–1847)
On 24 July 1855 in Oxford, Thomson married Zoë Skene daughter of James Henry Skene (1812–), British Consul at Aleppo.

They had the following children:
*Ethel Zoë Thomson (1856–), who later edited Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Life and Letters&quot;.
*Wilfred Forbes Home Thomson (1858–1939)
*Jocelyn Home Thomson (1859–1908)
*Sir Basil Home Thomson, KCB (21 April 1861 – 26 March 1939), a British intelligence officer, police officer, prison governor, colonial administrator, and writer
* Zoë Jane Thomson (1862–)
* Beatrice Mary Thomson (1864–)
*Alexandra Thomson (1867–1907). Married Col. John Studholme (10 February 1863 – 26 May 1934)
*Madeline Ita Mary Thomson (1880–)
*Bernard Henry Home Thomson (1874–1924), his granddaughter is the author Rose Tremain, and his great grandchildren are Rachael Daniel, Tamsin Daniel, Cléon Daniel, and Sebastian Daniel.

<text>William Connor Magee (17 December 1821 – 5 May 1891) was an Irish clergyman of the Anglican church, Bishop of Peterborough 1868–1891 and Archbishop of York for a short period in 1891.

==Life==
He was born in Cork, Ireland. His father was a minor canon of St Fin Barre&#x27;s Cathedral, Cork and a curate of the parish attached to the Anglican cathedral; his grandfather was William Magee, Archbishop of Dublin. Young Magee was educated at Kilkenny College and entered Trinity College, Dublin with a scholarship at thirteen. In November 1843, he delivered the inaugural address as Auditor of the reformed College Historical Society, in Trinity College.

He was ordained in 1844 to the curacy of St Thomas&#x27;s, Dublin, but, being threatened with tuberculosis, went after two years to Málaga, Spain. On his return he took a curacy at Bath, England (1849–1851) and was soon appointed to the Octagon Chapel (1851–1860), where his fame both as preacher and platform speaker continued to spread. Some years afterwards he was made prebendary of Wells Cathedral. In 1860, poor health caused him to accept the living of Enniskillen, Ireland. In 1864 he was made Dean of Cork and in 1866, additionally, Dean of the Chapel Royal, Dublin Castle, and a chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant. Here he showed those great gifts which ultimately raised him to high office; a powerful grasp of mental, moral and political problems, combined with eloquence of a high order, illuminated with brilliant flashes of wit.

In 1868 the question of the disestablishment of the Irish church came to the fore, and Magee threw himself into its defence with his usual energy and vivacity. The success of his orations caused Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to offer him the bishopric of Peterborough, England. He justified his appointment by his magnificent speech when the Disestablishment Bill reached the House of Lords in 1869, and then plunged into diocesan and general work in England. He preached three remarkable sermons on Christian Evidence in Norwich Cathedral in 1871. He took up the temperance question, and declared in the House of Lords that he would rather see &quot;England free than England compulsorily sober&quot;, a statement which was misquoted and attacked.

Initially highly critical of the calling of the second Lambeth Conference (1878) he was won over by the experience, writing in his biography that,
He was also a supporter of the movement for abolishing the recitation of the Athanasian Creed in the public services of the Church of England, believing, as he said, that the &quot;presence&quot; of the damnatory clauses, &quot;as they stand and where they stand, is a real peril to the Church and to Christianity itself&quot;, and that those clauses &quot;are no essential part&quot; of the creed. The project was laid aside because of the hostility of a large body of the clergy, reinforced by the threat of Edward Bouverie Pusey and Canon Henry Parry Liddon to abandon their offices if it were carried.

He was elevated to the see of York in January 1891 and enthroned on 17 March. By this time his energies were exhausted, and he died on 5 May, four months after his appointment.

He was buried at Peterborough Cathedral. The life-size marble effigy marking his grave lies in the south aisle.

==Family==

He married his cousin Anne Smith in 1851.

==Legacy==

Magee had taken a prominent part in the Ritual controversy, opposing what he conceived to be romanising excess in ritual, as well as the endeavour of the opposite party to &quot;put down Ritualism&quot;, as Disraeli expressed it, by the operation of the civil law. His incisive way of putting things earned for him the title of the &quot;Militant Bishop&quot;, but his efforts were ever for peace. Magee&#x27;s manifold activities, his capability as an administrator, his sound judgment, and his remarkable, insight into the ecclesiastical problems of his time, rank him among the most distinguished of English prelates.

==Quotes==

&quot;The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything.&quot; – W. C. Magee, 1868

&quot;I should say it would be better that England should be free than that England should be compulsorily sober.&quot; 1872

<text>William Rathbone Greg (1809 – 15 November 1881) was an English essayist.

==Life==
Born in Manchester, the son of Samuel Greg, the creator of Quarry Bank Mill, and Hannah Greg, he was brother to Robert Hyde Greg and the junior Samuel Greg.

He was educated at the University of Edinburgh. In 1827, he joined the Plinian Society, on the same day as Charles Darwin. Greg offered a talk to prove &quot;the lower animals possess every faculty &amp; propensity of the human mind&quot;.

For a time, he managed a mill of his father&#x27;s at Bury, and in 1832 began business on his own account. He entered the struggle for free trade, and obtained in 1842 the prize offered by the Anti-Corn Law League for the best essay on &quot;Agriculture and the Corn Laws.&quot; He was too busy with political, economical and theological speculations to give undivided attention to his business, which he gave up in 1850 to devote himself to writing. His &quot;Creed of Christendom&quot; was published in 1851, and in 1852 he contributed no less than twelve articles to four leading quarterlies. Disraeli praised him. Sir George Cornewall Lewis bestowed a Commissionership of Customs on him in 1856. In 1864 he was made Comptroller of Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office.

In 1868 he responded to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; with an article in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;On the failure of &#x27;Natural Selection&#x27; in the case of Man&quot;. In this he argues that natural selection no longer operates within civilised societies, endorsing eugenicist ideas to counter this fact. Darwin cited this, and responded, in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;.

He became a member of the Metaphysical Society. Besides contributions to periodicals he produced several volumes of essays on political and social philosophy. The general spirit of these is indicated by the titles of two of the best known, &quot;The Enigmas of Life&quot; (1872) and &quot;Rocks Ahead&quot; (1874). They represent a reaction from the high hopes of the author&#x27;s youth, when wise legislation was assumed to be a remedy for every public ill. Greg was interested in many philanthropic works. He died at Wimbledon, London.

He was married in 1835 to Lucy, daughter of William Henry, and also of Manchester. His second wife was the daughter of James Wilson.

One son, Percy Greg, was also a writer; another, Walter Wilson Greg, was a leading bibliographer of English Renaissance theatre.

<text>William Thomas Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank, (born 28 October 1928) is a British politician and life peer. As a Labour Party member of Parliament, he served as Secretary of State for Transport from 1976 to 1979, and was one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; of senior Labour politicians who defected to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He subsequently helped to lead the SDP into the merger that formed the Liberal Democrats in 1988, and later served as the party&#x27;s leader in the House of Lords between 1997 and 2001.

==Early life==
Rodgers was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, and educated at Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. After national service in the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool), he studied Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford on an Open Exhibition. He was general secretary of the Fabian Society from 1953 to 1960 and a councillor on St Marylebone Borough Council from 1958 to 1962. He was instrumental in lobbying the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party to reverse its vote in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament in 1961. He also unsuccessfully fought a by-election at Bristol West in 1957.

==Political career==
Rodgers first entered the House of Commons at a by-election in 1962, representing Stockton-on-Tees, and served in Labour governments under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, becoming Secretary of State for Transport in Callaghan&#x27;s cabinet in 1976. Within the Labour Party, he was known for being a highly effective organiser around centrist causes such as multilateral nuclear disarmament and Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Economic Community. He held the post until Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1979 general election. From 1979 to 1981 he was Shadow Defence Secretary. With Labour drifting to the left, Rodgers joined Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and David Owen in forming the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. In September 1982, Rodgers stood to become the president of the SDP, but took only 19.4 per cent of the vote, finishing in a distant second place behind Williams.

At the 1983 general election the SDP–Liberal Alliance won many votes but few seats, and Rodgers lost his seat of Stockton North (known as Stockton-on-Tees before the boundary changes of 1983). He remained outside Parliament, unsuccessfully contesting Milton Keynes for the SDP in the 1987 general election, until he was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank, of Kentish Town in the London Borough of Camden&quot;, on 12 February 1992. During that interval he was Director-General of the Royal Institute of British Architects and also became Chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority.

In 1987, Rodgers was chairman of the successful &quot;Yes to Unity&quot; campaign within the SDP in favour of merger with the Liberal Party. He became the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Lords spokesman on home affairs in 1994 and was the party&#x27;s leader in the Lords between 1997 and 2001. Rodgers&#x27;s autobiography was titled &quot;Fourth Among Equals&quot;, reflecting his position as the least prominent of the SDP&#x27;s founders. He was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

Rodgers retired from the House of Lords on 12 December 2023.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Rodgers married Silvia Szulman (1928–2006), a Berlin-born artist and writer, who became a political hostess. The couple had three daughters: Rachel, Lucy, and Juliet.

On 8 May 2001, Rodgers suffered a stroke at his home and was treated at the Royal Free Hospital and attended speech therapy sessions at North Middlesex Hospital for two and a half years. He said he was &quot;very, very lucky not to have suffered any physical damage&quot; as a result. He has since been a keen advocate for better treatment and care for stroke victims.

==In popular culture==
Rodgers was a main character in Steve Waters&#x27;s 2017 play &quot;Limehouse&quot;, which premiered at the Donmar Warehouse; he was portrayed by Paul Chahidi.
